HunCam has a background of a brown to light tan gradient, overprinted with a dark green, olive green, and lime green gradient and a top layer of opaque dark brown and cream-colored shapes spread throughout the pattern.

History Nallƒ± Masjid (left) next to the Istanbul Governor's Office, former headquarters of the Ottoman Government, called the Sublime Porte. It was built by ƒ∞mam Ali Efendi, a relative of Ottoman religious scholar, poet and mystic saint Akshamsaddin (1389‚Äì1459) during the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror (reigned 1444‚Äì1446, 1451‚Äì1481) in the 15th century. Originally, the mosque was situated within the yard of the Sublime Porte Building with one side on Ankara Street. It came to appearance when the traffic on the Ankara Street became limited due to the construction of Marmaray. ƒ∞mam Ali Efendi's grave is found behind the close Cevdet Pasha Library building. It was turned into a mosque after Grand vizier Hekimoƒülu Ali Pasha's (1689‚Äì1758) brother Feyzullah Efendi built a minbar. The building burnt down during the Fire of Sublime Porte () in the 1800s. According to the inscription calligraphed by Mustafa ƒ∞zzet Efendi, the mosque was rebuilt in 1869. A second inscription by Sami Efendi states its restoration in 1902. Architecture The mosque is designed in eclectic architectural style and some details are used which are normally seen in the Indian and Iranian architecture. It is painted today in red and white, although the original color was yellow and beige. It has a square-plan of dimensions. It has one dome sitting on an octagonal haunch.

The bridge is quite large and wide, with prominent semi-circular outline. It is built of hewn stone blocks, rough stones, and mortar. The bridge is inscribed on the list of the Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance of Georgia. The exact date when the Varjanauli bridge was constructed is not known. According to a local tradition, it was commissioned by the local Muslim Georgian nobleman Tamaz-Oghli (Tamazashvili) in the 17th century. Voussoirs at both sides of the bridge are made of hewn stone and lime mortar. They are arranged in a vertical mode. The arch and the sides of the bridge are covered with a series of neatly hewn stone blocks. The bridge rests on abutments cut into the rock on both banks. The stones used for the lower face of the arch are packed symmetrically with the voussoirs, so that the arch looks like a monolith. The horizontal length of the bridge between the abutments is 14.6 m, while the roadway measures 28.1 m; width at the middle part is 2.6 m and near the abutments 3.5 m; height from the water level to the arch is 7.9 m and to the top of the arch 8.6m. Size of the holes for the arch-form are: 0.36 x 42 m and 0.38 x 0.32 m. The bridge underwent the government-funded conservation works in 2008.

Biography  Vladimir Draganer was born on March 2, 1981 in the village of Liubashivka, Odessa Oblast. Later on, he and his mother moved to the city of Kamyshin, where they settled on Bazarov Street. As a child, his mother humiliated him and severely beat Vladimir for the slightest offense. After graduating from school, Draganer entered Vocational School Number 14, where he studied in the Crime Commission. He dreamed of serving in the Russian Armed Forces, wanting to learn to use weapons without fear, using them to kill people, which was one of the reasons he committed his later murders. Since March 8, 1999, Draganer committed three murders of girls with extreme cruelty, inflicting over 50 stab wounds on one of his victims. However, he never raped or robbed his victims, taking only symbolic things (such as jewelry) as trophies. In the summer of 1999, for the first time, one of the victims survived his attacks and gave a description of the criminal to the police, but that didn't help the investigators. Draganer also killed two young people. His accomplices in these crimes were acquaintances from the vocational school: Pavel Ivannikov, Alexey Kozlov and brothers Alexander and Dmitry Shubin. At first, Draganer proposed killing a fellow student who, according to his friends, \\"terrorized\\" them. The student was taken out on a fishing trip, where he was beaten unconscious. He was then tied up, with a piece of iron tied to his foot, and thrown into the Volga River. After some time, the corpse surfaced - in the ACT's reports, he was listed as unidentified. One day, one of Draganer's friends, Ivan, saw blood-stained clothes on him and asked if he was the Kamyshin Maniac, whom everyone is looking for. In Vladimir's own words, Ivan signed his death sentence. Draganer and his accomplices beat him in cold blood and, having tied him up, took Ivan along a dirt road leading to the village of Sestrenka, to plantations near the military unit area. A grave was dug there, into which the victim was thrown and subsequently shot by Draganer. After killing him, the criminals filled up the grave. The friend was soon pronounced missing, with his case photographs provided by relatives ending up on the table of the same investigator who was on the Kamyshing Maniac case. In late August 1999, the surviving victim accidentally noticed a photograph on the investigator's desk, in which the missing Ivan was in frame along with his buddy Vladimir Draganer, identifying the latter was the man who had attacked her. He was quickly detained while in the military, in the draft board. Draganer immediately admitted committing all of the crimes and implicated his accomplices, also accusing his mother of instilling a hatred of women in him. He had dreamed of taking revenge since childhood, so he killed his first victim on International Women's Day. The subsequent forensic psychiatric examination concluded that Draganer was sane, did not suffer from a mental disorder and was clearly aware of his actions. On July 18, 2001, he was given life imprisonment by the Volgograd Regional Court. His accomplices were sentenced to similar long terms of imprisonment. He was sent to serve his sentence in the Black Dolphin Prison, in Orenburg Oblast.

Founded in 2016 by Del Bigtree, it spreads myths about the risks of vaccines and contributes to vaccine hesitancy, which has been identified by the World Health Organization as one of the top ten global health threats of 2019. Funding and activities ICAN was founded in 2016 by television producer Del Bigtree, after the release of the movie Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe, which he wrote and produced, with anti-vaccination activist Andrew Wakefield directing. The national attention Bigtree gained with the movie and its promotion tour allowed the newly-formed group to quickly assume a leading role among the anti-vaccination movement. Scientists have countered many of ICAN's statements, arguments against vaccination being contradicted by overwhelming scientific consensus about the safety and efficacy of vaccines. ICAN was established with a $100,000 grant from the Selz Foundation. Its budget ballooned to $1.4 million in 2017, with one million coming from the Selz Foundation, making ICAN the most well-funded anti- vaccination group in the United States that year. ICAN pays a salary of $146,000 to Del Bigtree as its CEO and $98,000 to its Chief Administrative Officer Catharine Layton. An article in Rolling Stone states that Layton stumbled upon the anti-vaccine movement on social media after her two sons were diagnosed with autism. In 2019, Bigtree was a keynote speaker at several anti-vaccination events targeting the ultra-Orthodox Jewish in Brooklyn and in Rockland County. He has been criticized by the Anti-Defamation League and the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum for wearing a Star of David at an anti- vaccination event, attempting to compare the treatment of those opposed to vaccination with the persecution of the Jewish people. Bigtree's anti-vaccine advocacy has been described by anti-vaccination movement critic physician David Gorski as \\"fear mongering based on misinformation\\". Access to information lawsuit In 2018, ICAN filed Freedom of information lawsuits to force the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to release administrative reports on childhood vaccine injury HHS is required to file with Congress. HHS replied that they could not find any such reports. While ICAN claimed the absence of these reports means that the federal government has neglected to properly study the effect of vaccines, scientists and the fact-checking site Politifact pointed out a large number of in-depth studies were undertaken and their results shared with the public, even though HHS failed to file the required reports.

MLC origins go back over a hundred years, when in the 1880s, the advantages of DC long-distance transmission became evident. Modular multi-level converters (MMC) were investigated by Tricoli et al in 2017. Although their viability for electric vehicles (EV) was established, suitable low-cost semiconductors to make this topology competitive are not currently available (as of 2019). In 1999, Tolbert described the use of MLC for battery operated electric motors.

They served as part of a broader movement called the highway revolts, freeway revolts, road protests, or expressway revolts. They were active until at least the mid-1980s. Highway Trust Fund In 1956, the United States began constructing the Interstate Highway System, the largest public works project in history. In rural areas the highways were popular, but by the late 1960s many Interstates had begun to penetrate inner cities, destroying neighborhoods, adding pollution, and generating political resistance. Local anti-highway groups sprang up in dozens of locations from Boston to Seattle calling for changes to the Highway Trust Fund, an exclusive source of highway-only dollars from Washington. Founding In 1971, Environmental Action and several other organizations launched the Highway Action Coalition (HAC) with the purpose of allowing the federal Highway Trust Fund to be used for mass transit and other non-highway transportation projects. Although the trust fund was among the nation‚Äôs most sacrosanct of funding sources, and although it was defended by the political might of the automobile, oil and construction industries, HAC used its citizen lobbying and its publication, The Concrete Opposition, to harness the anger and call for flexibility in funding all modes of transportation. Advocacy success On March 14, 1973, in a 49-44 vote, the Senate allowed up to $850 million of Trust Fund money to be spent on mass transit; while the House of Representatives did not go so far, the final compromise did ‚Äúbust the trust‚Äù for the first time. On August 13, President Richard Nixon signed the Federal- Aid Highway Act of 1973‚Äîstill with the old nomenclature but now allowing spending on transit.

Naomi Wild then went on social media and revealed how the collaboration took place: \\"We started glass house at Wynne's house, I wrote my parts there and the next day we found out Machine Gun Kelly had heard it and had already laid down verses. Two days later we met Colson at a glass house in the hills where he played us the track.\\" The song is about mourning the death of Kelly's peers, namely Nipsey Hussle (in the first verse), Lil Peep, Mac Miller and Linkin Park lead singer Chester Bennington (in the second verse). In the third verse, Kelly reflects on his personal life, namely his suicide attempt.

According to ABS-CBN, mentorship offered by camps such as Aces and Queens and Kagandahang Flores, another center offering pageant training, was credited for the successes of Filipino candidates in international beauty contests since 2010.  Background and formation  From 1970s until 1980s, pageant candidates did not go through training camps to prepare for international competitions. As contests became more competitive in the 1990s and 2000s, local bets attended pageant training that was held abroad like the ones that were run in Colombia and Venezuela. Before Venus Raj won a runner-up place in Miss Universe 2010, no Philippine contestants reached the pageant's semifinal round. Founders Jonas Gaffud and Nad Bronce persuaded then student Zorayda Ruth Andam in 2001 to participate in the Binibining Pilipinas. Gaffud and Bronce soon were joined by film director Jeffrey Jeturian and Arnold Mercado, and they formed a group called Mabuhay Beauties. When it expanded, it was then known by its current name.  Candidates  The camp helped the campaigns of Filipino candidates in international pageants such as Andam, Gionna Cabrera, Lia Ramos, Miss Universe 2015 Pia Wurtzbach, Miss World 2013 Megan Young, Miss Universe 2014 3rd runner-up Ariella Arida, Miss Universe 2012 1st runner-up Janine Tugonon, Miss World 1st runner-up Gwen Ruais, Miss Universe 2011 third runner-up Shamcey Supsup, and Miss Universe 2010 4th runner-up Venus Raj. Trainings, which are held in Pasig and Mandaluyong, included physical fitness, make-up, fashion, and communication skills. Some candidates have transferred to other training camps as with Mary Jean Lastimosa, who transferred from Aces & Queens to Kagandahang Flores in 2014.  Impact  According to Agence France Presse, the rise of boot camps dedicated to beauty pageant preparations had helped in making the Philippines \\"a beauty pageant superpower.\\" However, pageants were reportedly criticized as outdated and a form of objectification of women. In particular, the camp received disapproval for providing training to foreign candidates, particularly that of Miss Universe Indonesia Kezia Warouw. Gaffud stated in an interview that Warouw's coaching consisted a \\"pep talk\\" and a favor to Albert Kurniawan, a mentor who had been giving free make-up tutorials to trainees. Additionally, Lastimosa's transfer to Kagandahang Flores allegedly caused a rift among founders of the two camps, although such transfers were commonplace and previously attracted little attention. Aces & Queens was also reportedly persuading candidates to switch to attend its program in a bid to attract potential winners. The claim was refuted by Gaffud as not true and blamed social media for triggering \\"camp wars\\".

It is the second of the five Smradlivi Lakes and is situated at an altitude of 2,298 m in a hanging valley facing the valley of the Rilska River to the north between the summits of Rilets (2,713 m) to the south-west and Kyoravitsa (2,612 m) to the south. It falls within the boundaries of the Rila Monastery Nature Park. The Smradlivo Lake is oval shaped with a maximum length of 900 m the width of 260 m. With a surface area of 212,000 m¬≤ (21.2 ha) it is the largest glacial lake in Bulgaria and the Balkan Peninsula. Its depth reaches 24 m; the volume is around 1,720,000 m¬≥. Its outflow is at the northern end, forming a stream that flows into the Rilska River, a left tributary of the Struma, after 1.2 km. Along its northern shore there is a small dyke to regulate the outflow to the small Rilska cascade. The waters of the Smradlivo Lake have low hardness, high content of oxygen and low oxidisability. It sustains populations of brown trout and due to its remoteness there are brown bears, chamois and red deer roaming the forests in the vicinity of the lake. In Bulgarian language the name of the lake means the Stinking Lake. Many legends about the lake are linked with the 10th-century medieval Bulgarian hermit and saint John of Rila who found refuge in the nearby valleys and established the Rila Monastery.

Based on the underpinnings of the Apollo Intensa Emozione, the car is meant to be a homage to the De Tomaso P70 prototype racing car. Development history The De Tomaso brand was acquired by Hong- Kong based IdealVentures in 2014, the same company who had acquired German automobile manufacturer Gumpert. Under the new management, work was started to revive the brand after a failed attempt in 2009. After an advertising campaign based on the company's history and some teaser videos of the new car in development under the code name \\"Project P\\", the company introduced the new sports car at the 2019 Goodwood Festival of Speed. The new car, called the P72 uses a carbon fibre monocoque chassis constructed to LMP1 standards and is based on the Apollo Intensa Emozione. Unlike the Intensa Emozione, the car is meant to be a grand tourer. Design =Exterior= Designed by Jowyn Wong of Wyn Design, the exterior design is based on the P70 racing car and the LeMans race cars of the 1970s and combines modern elements with the classic shape. The exterior also features a top mounted exhaust system. =Interior= The interior is upholstered in diamond stitched leather, and has opulent instrumentation featuring polished copper elements, along with an open linkage gearshift lever finished in copper of the manual transmission installed in the car. The interior also has circular analogue and digital instrumentation design to recall the car interiors of the 1960s and 1970s.  Specifications  In October 2019, De Tomaso revealed that the P72 will be powered by a 5.0 litre supercharged Ford Coyote V8 engine featuring a roots type supercharger manufactured by American tuning company Roush. The engine is a result of a technical collaboration between both companies. The engine is mated to a 6-speed manual transmission. Power output figures were not disclosed as the engine is still in development stage. The P72 will have a top speed of 221mph and will sprint from 0-60mph in about 2 seconds. De Tomaso is hoping for the car to have an RPM of 7500. Production 72 units of the P72 are planned to be produced. This move was made to ensure exclusivity of the car. The car is still due for road homologation but De Tomaso have assured that the car will remain the same as the pre-production model shown at Goodwood.

History The fernery at Walton Lea circa 1874 The rose garden at now demolished Walton Lea mansion The garden was created circa 1864 as the kitchen garden to the Walton Lea mansion house. It was designed by Edward Walters and built by George Crosfield, the eldest son of soap manufacturing pioneer Joseph Crosfield. In the early 1900s the house was bought by the Armitage family. In 1923 it was bought by the Greenall family, owners of nearby Walton Hall. The Greenall and Crosfield families were political rivals and in 1925 the Greenalls demolished the mansion leaving only the garden, cottages and associated buildings. The estate also included a fernery and rose garden that are no longer in existence. The walled garden later passed to Warrington Borough Council. It is in now managed by the Walton Lea project to benefit the community and people with disabilities. Description The garden has an area of one acre with intact walls.

He lived for two years as a Barbary slave and wrote a famous book about his experiences. Biography =Early life and education = Aranda was a descendant of a family that came from Valladolid in Spain and had settled in Bruges for several generations., \\"De integratie van de Castiliaanse familie De Aranda in Brugge, 1500‚Äì1765\\", in: Handelingen van het Genootschap voor Geschiedenis, 2000 They were mainly active in the textile industry and were of distinguished ranks among the Spanish Nation. Emmanuel's father, Don Francisco, was a consular. His mother's name was Anne Van Severen. His oldest brother Franciscus, married Isabelle Cloribus, had also moved to Bruges around 1930 and became the mayor. After completing his law studies at the University of Leuven, Aranda was ready to step into the family business. In preparation, he made a trip to Spain. He left in 1639 and was joined by Renier Saldens (a doctor from Oostkamp), the Bruges junior Jan Baptiste Van Caloen and knight Philips de Cerf (or Ducherf, lord of Hondschoote and Leystrate, who later became mayor of Veurne). =Hijacking= Next year, the group returned to County of Flanders. They settled in San Sebasti√°n on an English merchant ship that was hijacked off the coast of Brittany on August 22, 1640 by Barbary pirates under the command of an English turncoat. One day before, Aranda's ship was chased by a suspicious Caravel, but the naive captain did not try to get away. The carload was supported by two larger ships, which hoisted the Algiers silver green flag of Algeria. The crew of the merchant ship were captured without a fight and taken to a nearby port. Aranda was taken as a slave to Algeria and was sold there as a slave. He stayed there for a little more than a year (1640-1641) while his exchange was negotiated and could return to Duchy of Brabant in 1642.Dezobry et Bachelet, Dictionnaire de biographie, t.1, Ch.Delagrave, 1876, p.121 = Slavery = In Algeria captives were led to the palace of the Pasha, who was able to claim one eighth of the prisoners brought in. Aranda and his other companions were sold at the slave market (also known as zoco or bedesten). Grand Admiral Ali Pegelin paid 200 stakes for Aranda. The frail Arando had to do heavy labor in a flour warehouse. He later described how he almost collapsed. He then became a construction worker at Pegelin's country house and later a house servant. = Release and return= Negotiations for ransom were complicated because prisoners did not want to show that they were rich and had given false names. Finally, Arando and Caldo, his companion, were exchanged against five Muslims who were detained in Flanders. They were released to pick up the Algerians in Dunkirk. He brought them to Ceuta. After an eventful sea voyage, Aranda and Caldo arrived in T√©touan, where they had some memorable moments in the 'Matemoren' (overcrowded underground slave dungeons). They could travel on to Ceuta, where the exchange took place and they were received by the Spanish governor Miranda. On March 24, 1642, Aranda made the crossing to Gibraltar, from where he traveled by land to Rouen. There he embarked to Dover, from there to Dunkirk, and so on by land until he reached his hometown on August 20, 1642. = Lawyer and writer in Bruges = Thanks to Francisco de Valcarcel y Velasquez, Aranda was able to work as a military auditor for the quarterly of West Flanders. On December 26, 1644, he married eighteen-year-old Catharina van Hauweghem in the Saint Michael's Church in Ghent. They had fourteen children. He published a report of his experience as Relation de la captivit√©, et libert√© du Sieur Emanuel de Aranda. Later a didactico-burlesque poetry followed about the Seven deadly sins (1679), written in the style of Adriaan Poirters. In the last weeks of his life he wrote another work about the Bruges of his time, but he did not get achanceto publish it., Emmanuel de Aranda, in: Biographie nationale de Belgique, vol. I, Brussel, 1866, kol. 357-362 History of Turckish slavery Aranda wrote his own story and had it published in French by the Brussels printer Jan Mommaert (1656). It provides a remarkable view for that time. Nevertheless, the Dutch text of the manuscriptOwned by the Loppem Castle Foundation explains that the 'universal morality' was mainly found in the commercial edition (that was continually emphasized throughout successive editions, undoubtedly on the initiative of the publisher). The question even arises whether Aranda herself was the author of the stories, as claimed in the book. In any case, it was a successful choice, because the work found international resonance. English and Dutch and also later the French editions of the book were published. (1671). In its final form, the work consisted of the following parts: *preliminary work (family history and description of Algieria in antiquity, which he identified with ancient Julia Caesarea); *chronological report of the hijacking until the return to Bruges; *37 moralizing stories. It is an interesting example of a captivity tale or a slave narrative. Curiously enough, Aranda does not mention the fact that one of his ancestors had made a spectacular passage in Algieria 63 years before him. It was about Don Miguel de Aranda from Valencia, a priest from the order of Monles√†, who was burned alive on May 15, 1577 at the port of the hijacker's city. This had happened under the eyes of Cervantes, who did not fail to mention it in Los ba√±os de Argel.

The braking system is a dual-circuit hydraulic system with disc brakes on the front, and drums on the rear wheels. A rack- and-pinion system is used for steering. The wheelsize is 13 in (330 mm). The Trabant is powered by a carburetted, water-cooled, Barkas B820 four-cylinder, OHC, Otto engine (a version of the VW EA 111 engine produced under licence). This engine displaces 1.1 litres and is rated 30 kW; it produces a maximum torque of 72.6 N¬∑m. The torque is transmitted from the engine to the front wheels with a dry single-disc clutch and a manual four-speed gearbox. Unlike the Trabant 601, the 1.1 does not have a column mounted gear shifter, instead, it uses a floormounted gearshift lever on the right-hand side of the driver's seat.

There are nine Dioceses in Austria. Each Diocese reports to a Caritas institution which reports to the Diocesan bishop and not to Caritas Austria.  Staff members  In 2018, there were 15,648 full-time employees, around 50,000 volunteers, in parishes and Caritas facilities, working in 36 social counselling centres, 34 shelters for the homeless, including ten mother-child homes, 247 refugee homes and 36 counselling centres for migrants. Caritas also operates 48 homes for the elderly and nursing homes (for about 4,750 elderly people). 3,013 employees look after about 6,877 persons (in part-time and full-time living also social-psychiatric, in work projects and the like).  Structure  The Austrian Caritas consists of the nine independent organisations with their own financial responsibility in the Austrian dioceses. The central coordination currently consists of Michael Landau as President and the Secretary General Bernd Wachter and his deputy Christoph Schweifer (Secretary General for International Programmes). Each individual Caritas Institution is a separate legal body and acts as a supporting organisation for social services. Most of them are registered as associations under Church law. Organisations in the Dioceses: * Caritas der Di√∂zese Feldkirch * Caritas der Erzdi√∂zese Wien * Caritas St. P√∂lten * Caritas Burgenland * Caritas der Di√∂zese Graz-Seckau * Caritas Ober√∂sterreich * K√§rntner Caritasverband * Caritas der Di√∂zese Innsbruck * Caritas Salzburg Each parish has its own parish charity: a total of 33,000 parish charity employees work for \\"active charity\\". They organise visiting services, senior meetings, benefit events, discussion groups, flea markets, Caritas showcases, holiday programmes for children, individual financial help, refugee aid, house collections and much more.  Development  Caritas movement in Austria can be traced back to the first Caritas Congresses shortly after the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. The organisational structure at that time was based on the German model. Shortly after the World War I, nine regional associations were established. The first focal points of activity were, according to the emergency, meals and children's recreation activities in the country. The Caritas funeral care took care of a Christian funeral for people from poorer social classes. Later - analogous to the Federal Republic of Germany - fields of activity such as nursing services, care and family assistance were added, homeless, disabled and refugee assistance (for example during the Hungarian popular uprising of 1956), social counselling, the Caritas shops, mother-child houses and finally (mobile) hospice work and employment projects. In 2015, the Austrian Caritas supported more than 72,000 people with advice and also financially in its 36 social counselling centres and disbursed around four million Euros in emergency aid. Caritas Family helpers look after children and the household when the parents are no longer able to do so. Caritas activities abroad mainly are disaster relief and development cooperation.  Financing  Over the past decades, Caritas has transformed itself from a donor company to a service company in the vicinity of the public sector. Meanwhile (2017) only about 8% of the expenses are covered by donations (including church contributions), in 2015 it was still about 10%. The predominant part (62%) is accounted for by fees for services from public funds, the rest largely by private fees and (state) subsidies. Due to the strong dependence on (state) service fees, the self-definition as an aid organisation is partly doubted and Caritas is described as \\"a company with an annual turnover of over 900 million euros\\". This criticism was rejected by Caritas President Landau with reference to the general interest in the work of Caritas. In 2017, donations rose to 77.58 million euros. This makes Caritas the non-profit organisation with the highest donations in Austria. Caritas' turnover is exempt from turnover tax.

The theory is derived from observations in medical neuroimaging and from the empirical response of some antipsychotics and their antagonistic effects on the dopamine receptor. However, it is important to outline that the hypothesis does not consider the excessive dopaminergic activity as the direct cause of stuttering; instead, this synaptic dysregulation is a symptom of a greater disorder that affects other brain pathways and structures.  Introduction  Following the comparative analysis of brain imaging of stuttering and non-stuttering speakers, people who stutter seem to display a heightened dopaminergic activity in striatal regions of the brain. This has been described during a PET study using fluoro-L-DOPA as a marker of presynaptic dopaminergic activity and an MRI study of brain activation patterns. Since dopamine acts as an inhibitor of striatal metabolism, striatal hypometabolism can be explained by the recorded increased levels of presynaptic dopamine in people who stutter as compared to controls groups. There was a significantly higher dopamine reuptake activity in the cortex and subcortical regions associated with speech in people who stuttered, further supporting the hypothesis that dopaminergic pathways within the mesocortical and limbic systems may be more elevated than the norm in people who stutter.  Arguments in favour of a dopamine hypothesis  = Haloperidol = The typical antipsychotic haloperidol has been the most used drug in treatment trials for stuttering. In double-blind placebo-controlled trials with objective speech measures, the group receiving haloperidol displayed significant improvement after a 8-week trial. However, the mechanism of action of this first generation psychotic bore important side effects that affected the tolerability in patients and maintaining the improved speech required that subjects keep taking the drug. Moreover, the trial was conducted before the full extent of the risks of using neuroleptics was appreciated; the extrapyramidal symptoms and the possible permanent tardive dyskinea that could result now qualify the drug as dangerous and possibly disproportionate in the treatment of stuttering. Taking into account Haloperidol's mechanism of action that specifically targets dopamine receptors (through silent antagonist for D1, D5 and inverse agonist for D2, D3, D4) unlike other neuroleptics as well as its effectiveness over a placebo, the dopaminergic pathway seems to be correlated to the symptoms of stuttering since the drug normalised to some extent the dopaminergic hyperactive state. = Aripiprazole = Aripiprazole's mode of action differs from other atypical antipsychotics in its selectivity with dopamine receptors (partial agonist activity on postsynaptic D2 receptor and partial agonist activity on presynaptic D2, D3 and partially D4) and serotonin receptors (partial agonist of 5-HT1A and antagonist of 5-HT2A. Aripiprazole's main antagonist action on the dopamine D2 postsynaptic receptor is believed to decrease excessive dopaminergic activity and may also decrease the synthesis and release of dopamine through its presynaptic D2 antagonist action. Furthermore, the drug's agonist activity on seretonin receptor 5-HT1A is believed to possess an anxiolytic effect, providing an possible explanation for the decreased social anxiety patients noticed. = Antipsychotic-induced stuttering = Concomitantly, it is of interest to note that dopamine antagonist have also been reported to cause stuttering in some individuals and speech disorder has been characterised as a proper but uncommon side effect of aripiprazole during the premarketing trials of the drug (Abilify). This effect further corroborates the dysregulated dopaminergic character stuttering ensues from. = Similarities with other pathologies = Motor tics and Tourette's syndrome share important characteristics with stuttering; they all initially manifest in childhood, affect more males than females, obey a waxing and waning course, and increase in intensity under emotional stress. The treatment of tic disorders in children has been efficient with the administration of aripiprazole, namely single or multiple motor or vocal tics, alluding to similar mechanisms the disorder share with stuttering. Given that these other two conditions seem to respond to the same drug and given the symptomatic similarities, these three disorders not only share common features but maybe a very similar cause.

Religion, myth and folklore  The Discovery of Honey (c. 1500) by Piero di Cosimo Jesus rode on a donkey in his triumphal entry into Jerusalem Due to its widespread domestication and use, the donkey is referred to in myth and folklore around the world. In classical and ancient cultures, donkeys had a part. The donkey was the symbol of the Egyptian sun god Ra. In Greek myth, Silenus is pictured in Classical Antiquity and during the Renaissance (illustration, left) drunken and riding a donkey, and Midas was given the ears of an ass after misjudging a musical competition. Donkeys (or asses) are mentioned many times in the Bible, beginning in the first book and continuing through both Old and New Testaments, so they became part of Judeo- Christian tradition. They are portrayed as work animals, used for agricultural purposes, transport and as beasts of burden, and terminology is used to differentiate age and gender. In contrast, horses were represented only in the context of war, ridden by cavalry or pulling chariots. Owners were protected by law from loss caused by the death or injury of a donkey, showing their value in that time period. Narrative turning points in the Bible (and other stories) are often marked through the use of donkeys ‚Äî for instance, leading, saddling, or mounting/dismounting a donkey are used to show a change in focus or a decision having been made. They are used as a measure of wealth in Genesis 30:43, and in Genesis chapter 34, the prince of Shechem (the modern Nablus) is named Hamor (\\"donkey\\" in Hebrew). According to Old Testament prophecy, the Messiah is said to arrive on a donkey: \\"Behold, your King is coming to you; He is just and having salvation, Lowly and riding on a donkey, A colt, the foal of a donkey!\\" (Zechariah 9:9). According to the New Testament, this prophecy was fulfilled when Jesus entered Jerusalem riding on the animal (Matthew 21:4-7, John 12:14-15). Jesus appeared to be aware of this connection (Matthew 21:1-3, John 12:16). In the Jewish religion, the donkey is not a kosher animal. In the Zohar, it is considered avi avot hatuma i.e an ultimate impure animal, and doubly \\"impure\\", as it is both non-ruminant and non-cloven hoofed. However, it is the only impure animal that falls under the mitzvah (commandment) of firstborn (\\"bechor\\") consecration that also applies to humans and pure animals (See Petter Chamor). In Jewish Oral Tradition (Talmud Bavli), the son of David was prophesied as riding on a donkey if the tribes of Israel are undeserving of redemption. In contemporary Israel, the term \\"Messiah's Donkey\\" (Chamoro Shel Mashiach ◊ó◊û◊ï◊®◊ï ◊©◊ú ◊û◊©◊ô◊ó) stands at the centre of a controversial religious-political doctrine, under which it was the Heavenly-imposed \\"task\\" of secular Zionists to build up a Jewish State, but once the state is established they are fated to give place to the Religious who are ordained to lead the state. The secularists in this analogy are \\"The Donkey\\" while the religious who are fated to supplant them are a collective \\"Messiach\\". A book on the subject, published in 1998 by the militant secularist Sefi Rechlevsky, aroused a major controversy in the Israeli public opinion. With the rise of Christianity, some believers came to see the cross- shaped marking present on donkeys' backs and shoulders as a symbol of the animal's bearing Jesus into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. During the Middle Ages, Europeans used hairs from this cross (or contact with a donkey) as folk remedies to treat illness, including measles and whooping cough. Around 1400 AD, one physician listed riding backwards on a donkey as a cure for scorpion stings. Goddess Kalaratri rides a donkey. Donkeys are also referred to repeatedly in the writings and imagery of the Hinduism, where the goddess Kalaratri's vahana (vehicle) is a donkey. Donkeys also appear multiple times in Indian folklore as the subject of stories in both the Hitopadesha and the Panchatantra. In Islam, eating the meat of a domestic donkey is not allowed. Literature and film Donkeys hold a significant place in literature, especially in Western cultures. The original representations of donkeys in Western literature come mainly from the Bible and Ancient Greece. Donkeys were represented in a fairly negative form by the Greeks, but perceptions later changed, partially due to donkeys becoming increasingly symbolically connected to Christianity. Donkeys were found in the works of Homer, Aesop and Apuleius, where they were generally portrayed as stupid and stubborn, or servile at best, and generally represented the lower class. They were often contrasted with horses, which were seen as powerful and beautiful. Aesop's The Ass in the Lion's Skin, representational of the almost 20 of his fables that portray donkeys, shows the donkey as a fool. Apuleius's The Golden Ass (160 AD), where the narrator is turned into a donkey, is also notable for its portrayal of donkeys as stubborn, foolish, wicked and lowly. This work had a large influence on the portrayal of donkeys in later cultures, including medieval and renaissance Europe. During this time, donkeys continued to be shown as stupid, clumsy and slow. Shakespeare popularised the use of the word \\"ass\\" as an insult meaning stupid or clownish in many of his plays, including Bottom's appearance in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1600). In contrast, a few years later, Miguel de Cervantes writes a more positive slant on the donkey in his novel Don Quixote, primarily as Sancho Panza's mount, portraying them as steady and loyal companions. This difference is possibly due to donkeys being an important aspect of many Spaniards' lives at this point in time. In contrast to Grecian works, donkeys were portrayed in Biblical works as symbols of service, suffering, peace and humility. They are also associated with the theme of wisdom in the Old Testament story of Balaam's ass, and are seen in a positive light through the story of Jesus riding into Jerusalem on a donkey. By the 19th century, the donkey was portrayed with more positive attributes by popular authors. William Wordsworth portrayed the donkey as loyal and patient in his 1819 poem Peter Bell:A Tale, using the donkey as a Christian symbol. Robert Louis Stevenson in Travels with a Donkey (1879), portrays the animal as a stubborn beast of burden. Sympathetic portrayals return in Juan Ramon Jimenez's Platero and I. The melancholy Eeyore in Winnie the Pooh (first published in 1926) is arguably the most famous donkey in Western literature. Donkeys were featured in literature during the 20th century, including in George Orwell's 1951 Animal Farm, where Benjamin the donkey is portrayed as a resilient and loyal friend to Boxer the horse, as well as being wise, but he is also shown to be cynical about change and, like Eeyore, is resigned to his lot not improving. Puzzle is a well-meaning but easily manipulated donkey in C. S. Lewis's 1956 The Last Battle. Brighty is the central character of the 1953 children's novel and 1967 film Brighty of the Grand Canyon. Donkeys are portrayed in film including the 1940 Disney animated films Fantasia and Pinocchio, where the Coachman and his henchmen turning boys into donkeys in Pleasure Island, and in the segment of Beethoven's Symphony No. 6, a unicorn donkey named Jacchus with Bacchus and is attacked by Zeus. A donkey is featured as the main figure in the 1966 film Au hasard Balthazar by Robert Bresson, and, is given a life path of Christian symbolism. Donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy, is featured as a main character in the Shrek franchise of the 2000s. Philosophy In the play card, the best among all cards is the ass (donkey) card. It speaks to the symbolic significance donkey in arts, literature and philosophy. The symbolic use of the ass in philosophy and literature has been prevalent for centuries. It was increasingly used in the renaissance era from thinkers including Jean Buridan (1330-1358), Machiavelli (1469-1527) and Cornelius Agrippa (1486-1535). The philosopher Jean Buridan (1300-1358) proposed a dilemma in which a hypothetical donkey suffering from hunger and thirst finds itself halfway between a bucket of fresh water and enjoyable bales of hay. This makes the donkey perplexed, as it does not know whether to quench its thirst first or appease its hunger later or the vice versa. Its indecisiveness leads to its perish. This allegory could be taken as the cost of human inaction or as the total lack of free will versus determinism in human life. Agrippa placed apostles on a level with asses. He regarded the donkey as a means to achieve divinity: ‚ÄúFrom what I have said, it is clear as day that no other animal is in a better position than the ass to receive the divine. If you do not look to the ass, you will be no position to receive the divine mysteries.‚Äù (p. ix) Machiavelli complained that ‚Äúin the form of an ass, he had toiled and suffered to discover ‚Äúmore bad than good‚Äù at the every level of the world. Giordano Bruno (1548-1600) is another philosopher of the Renaissance Era who utilised the fictitious exposition of the donkey to achieve theoretical depth. In his long journey to explore the opposite aspects of the phenomenon of asininity, he combines the delicacy of an artist and the depth of a great philosopher: ‚Äúaccording to cabalistic revelations‚Ä¶, the ass or asininity is the symbol of wisdom‚Äù; ‚Äúpray, pray my dearest ones, that God may transform into asses if you are not already asses‚Äù; ‚ÄúStrive, strive, therefore, to be asses, who you are men‚Äù. In his masterpiece, In Praise of Folly, the Dutch philosopher Erasmus of Rotterdam (1466-1506) depicted the concept of asininity and applied it to the high-raking echelons of the society including kings, lawyers, grammarians, boastful theologians and even the pope himself. Politics Satirical use of braying in a political cartoon The Thomas Nast political cartoon that introduced the donkey as the mascot of the Democratic Party In keeping with their widespread cultural references, donkeys feature in political systems, symbols and terminology in many areas of the world. A \\"donkey vote\\" is a vote that simply writes down preferences in the order of the candidates (1 at the top, then 2, and so on), and is most often seen in countries with ranked voting systems and compulsory voting, such as Australia. The donkey is a common symbol of the Democratic Party of the United States, originating in the 1830s and became popularised from a cartoon by Thomas Nast of Harper's Weekly in 1870. The bray of the donkey may be used as a simile for loud and foolish speech in political mockery. For example, In 1963, Party of Donkeys, a frivolous political party was founded in Iran. The ruc catal√† or burro catal√† (Catalan donkey) has become a symbol of Catalonia in Spain. In 2003 some friends in Catalonia made bumper stickers featuring the burro catal√† as a reaction against a national advertising campaign for Toro d'Osborne, a brandy. The burro became popular as a nationalist symbol in Catalonia, whose residents wanted to assert their identity to resist Spanish centralism. Renewed attention to the regional burro helped start a breeding campaign for its preservation, and its numbers have increased. Proshka, an ass owned by the Russian populist nationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, became prominent during the 2012 Russian presidential election campaign, when he was filmed in an election advertisement video. In that controversial ad, Zhirinovsky appeared sitting in a sleigh harnessed with Proshka, then claiming that the \\"little wretched ass\\" is the symbol of Russia and that if he would become President a \\"daring troika\\" would return as a symbol of Russia instead of the ass; at the end, Zhirinovsky beat Proshka with a whip, made the ass move and had a ride on him through the snow-covered backyard of his dacha. International organisations People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and World Animal Protection have accused Zhirinovsky of cruelty to animals. Zhirinovsky replied to the assertions by stating that similar treatment is commonplace in the Arab world and claimed that his ass has been treated \\"better than many people\\". Colloquialisms, proverbs and insults Many cultures have colloquialisms and proverbs that include donkeys or asses. British phrases include \\"to talk the hind legs off a donkey\\", used to describe someone talking excessively and generally persuasively. Donkeys are the animals featured most often in Greek proverbs, including such statements of fatalistic resignation as \\"the donkey lets the rain soak him\\". The French philosopher Jean Buridan constructed the paradox called Buridan's ass, in which a donkey, placed exactly midway between water and food, would die of hunger and thirst because he could not find a reason to choose one of the options over the other, and so would never make a decision. Italy has several phrases regarding donkeys, including \\"put your money in the anus of a donkey and they'll call him sir\\" (meaning, if you're rich, you'll get respect) and \\"women, donkeys and goats all have heads\\" (meaning, women are as stubborn as donkeys and goats). The United States developed its own expressions, including \\"better a donkey that carries me than a horse that throws me\\", \\"a donkey looks beautiful to a donkey\\", and \\"a donkey is but a donkey though laden with gold\\", among others. From Afghanistan, we find the Pashto proverb, \\"Even if a donkey goes to Mecca, he is still a donkey.\\" In Ethiopia, there are many Amharic proverbs that demean donkeys, such as, \\"The heifer that spends time with a donkey learns to fart\\" (Bad company corrupts good morals). The words \\"donkey\\" and \\"ass\\" (or translations thereof) have come to have derogatory or insulting meaning in several languages, and generally means someone who is obstinate, stupid or silly, In football, especially in the United Kingdom, a player who is considered unskilful is often dubbed a \\"donkey\\", and the term has a similar connotation in poker. In the US, the slang terms \\"dumbass\\" and \\"jackass\\" are used to refer to someone considered stupid.

British architectural firm Foster + Partners was involved which designed The Estate as a cross-shaped building to reduce adverse sunlight exposure to occupants. Foster + Partners conducted various research including topographical studies and Makati's climate and sun patterns in designing the building. Finding sunlight in the Philippines to be strong, the firm designed The Estate's windows to angle in a certain way so it could provide non-excessive lighting to the building's units all of which were constructed column-free. The windows were also double-glazed to minimize heat from sunlight. The Estate is also the first residential building in the country to be built using double-slab technology which conceals the electricals and plumbing between two layers of concrete. The building will also be supported on top of a one-storey high plinth. The firms behind the project are aiming for the building to get LEED Gold Version 4 certification. Facilities The skyscraper will host 188 residential units including eight penthouse suites. The building also has 618 parking slots with charging support for electric vehicles.

At the core there is a set of loosely coupled microservices organized in different layers.  Features  The goal of the project is the simplification and standardization of edge computing architectures applicable in industrial IoT scenarios, where a heterogeneous set of devices, sensors, actuators and other IoT objects (the so called South Side) produce data that should be computed, and eventually analyzed, stored or aggregated on the fog and up to the cloud (the so called North Side). The framework is structured in different layers, each one composed of multiple micro services. The modular architecture allows users to easily scale, update and distribute the logic into different systems, improving maintainability. * Export services allows external (on- gateway or off-gateway) services to register within EdgeX as recipients for the data coming from the core. This layer contains services for registering recipients and processing data to be distributed to clients using different protocols, communicating directly with northbound infrastructure. In cases where the edge platform must operate independently, without contacting the north side, this layer can be avoided. * Supporting services contains services related to the communications of events and logging. In particular, a Rules Engine implements an event triggering mechanism based on user-defined rules applied on core data. The Notification & Alerts microservice dispatches event- related messages within or without the current systems as well as urgent alerts that need to be handled. The Logging service contains system log for each service, allowing administrators to monitor the behaviour of each components and their interactions. Finally the Scheduling service is used to plan the execution of tasks for cleaning stored data that has been already processed and transferred. * Core services is the central part of the framework, containing services for storing data coming from devices, and applying actions to them. Core data and Metadata functionalities process and store respectively data coming from southbound entities, and metadata about sensors, actuators and the types of data they are producing. The Command and Control module will take care of issuing commands and actions to other services, to applications within the same system or to external applications. * Devices services is made up of all services providing connections to southbound devices, ranging from sensors, actuators to home appliances, alarm systems and industrial machines. A backend for many different industry protocols is provided, while new backends can be included by using the provided SDK. While core services are required for the whole platform to work, as they are unchangeable, services in other layers may be inserted or replaced in a plug and play fashion. EdgeX Foundry provides also two additional layers, focused on system administration and security. * Security layer contains services for secret storage (passwords, access keys, certificates) and an API gateway acting as a secure proxy to all other internal services through authentication. * System management layer provides tools for managing microservices, visualize statistics about them to monitor the state of the system and get configurations for each components.  Deployment  EdgeX Foundry is compatible with Windows, macOS and Linux systems. However developers provide docker containers to ship pre-built and ready to go images of each component. Repositories provide a collection of docker-compose files that can be used to easily setup the entire platform by selecting the release version to target.

There is also an egalitarian three-sided gallery that runs around the main seating area.Temple Israel, Hillbrow, 1936 Joburg. Accessed on 6 December 2019 The idea to build the synagogue was sparked by a visit in 1929 of Prof. Abraham Zvi Idelsohn (1882-1938) who was visiting family in Johannesburg at the time. He held forth on Jewish music and the origins of Progressive Judaism, as Reform was also called. Idelsohn encouraged his brother Jerry to found a Reform group in the Gold City. After beginning to hold services in private homes in 1930, Jerry founded the South African Jewish Religious Union for Liberal Judaism (later the South African Union for Progressive Judaism (SAUPJ)). Jerry made contact with Moses Cyrus Weiler, at the time a student of the elder Idelsohn's at the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. After he was ordained in August 1933, Rabbi Weiler came to Johannesburg to found a Reform congregation. His first service was held in the Freemason's Hall at Clarendon Place at the edge of Hillbrow. At the end of 1933, a plot of 3/4 of an acre was purchased, and three years later, the synagogue officially opened. The imposing building was designed in Art Deco style and is four stories high. It was designed by the Jewish architect Hermann Kallenbach with his partners A.M. Kennedy and A.S. Furner. Kallenbach also designed the equally striking Greek Orthodox Church on Wolmarans Street and Jeppestown Reformed Church in Fairview. He also helped choose the site for the Great Synagogue on Wolmarans Street. On 6 August 1983 a limpet mine exploded outside the synagogue, four hours before State President Marais Viljoen was scheduled to attend a ceremony marking Temple Israel's 50th anniversary. There were no injuries and the celebration went ahead with Viljoen in attendance.

It manifested itself principally as a form of interior design popular in the homes of Britain's wealthy and well-born intellectual elite. Its name was coined by the English cartoonist and author Osbert Lancaster, as Curzon Street in Mayfair was an address popular with London high society.Oscar Wilde mentions the street in four of his works: in The Picture of Dorian Gray, Lord Henry Wotton lives on Curzon Street; in Lady Windermere's Fan, the notorious Mrs. Erlynne lives at 84A Curzon Street; in Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, Lady Clementine Beauchamp lives on Curzon Street; and in An Ideal Husband, Lord Goring lives on Curzon Street. While previous forms of Baroque interior design had relied on French 18th-century furnishings, in this form it was more often than not the heavier and more solid furniture of Italy, Spain, and southern Germany that came to symbolise the furnishings of new fashion.Sitwell, Home Sweet Home, p. 64 While in vogue, roughly between 1927 and 1939, Curzon Street Baroque was also disparagingly known as \\"Buggers' Baroque\\" or \\"Decorators' Baroque\\".Calloway, pp.44‚Äì47 This was, according to author Jane Stevenson, because \\"a statistically implausible number of important men and women, and their decorators in the interwar arts, were gay\\".The Evelyn Waugh Society retrieved 4 July 2019 Among them were many of the leading writers, poets, and designers who used and promoted the style. Naissance True Baroque architecture, internal and external, employs architectural drama and surprise, chiaroscuro (light and shadow) pulse and a diversity of fanciful and joyous shapes and curves. However, Baroque has never been truly to the British taste. Having evolved as a derivative form of Renaissance architecture, in mainland Europe, in the mid-17th century, it made a brief appearance in Britain, at the beginning of the 18th century. It was pioneered in Britain, most notably, by Sir John Vanbrugh with his three principal projects Blenheim Palace, Castle Howard, and Seaton Delaval. Of these three monumental houses, only the earliest, Castle Howard, employs the true fanciful style of Baroque seen in mainland Europe; the remaining two rely heavily on mass and chiaroscuro to display their baroque qualities. In Britain, the style soon fell from fashion, and by the 1760s was replaced by the more serious and severe Neoclassical architecture. Osbert Lancaster put the British dislike of Baroque down to a national \\"ill-concealed dislike\\" of \\"cleverness\\", a virtue essential for any successful Baroque architect. As a revival style, Baroque made a brief reappearance at the beginning of the 20th century, but in a confused form known as Edwardian Baroque architecture. As a revived form of interior decoration, it really dates from the 1924 publication of Sir Sacheverell Sitwell's book Southern Baroque Art, which concentrated on the ornate Baroque style then regarded as vulgar and excessive.Charlish Sitwell with his two siblings, Edith Sitwell and Osbert Sitwell, known collectively as the Sitwells, formed an identifiable literary and artistic clique around themselves in London during the period 1916 to 1930. The book's publication sparked an artistic reevaluation of the style. The painter Rex Whistler developed a Baroque influence to his work, while the society photographer Cecil Beaton has been described as full of \\"Baroque playfulness.\\" This influence was soon picked up by the leading high society decorators of the period, who developed a pared-back 20th-century version of Baroque. Osbert Lancaster, a satirist, author, and cartoonist, then named it Curzon Street Baroque (Curzon Street being one of London's smartest addresses). Often mixing antique and modern furniture in the same room, Curzon Street Baroque, has been described as a rejection of Modernism. However, as a reformation style, it was more a rejection of the dark and cluttered Victorian style. The opinion of Victorian Architecture and style was at an all-time low, with Osbert Lancaster's fellow wit and contemporary, PG Wodehouse, stating: \\"It is pretty generally admitted that few Victorians were to be trusted within reach of a trowel and a pile of bricks.\\" Curzon Street Baroque certainly avoided the straight clean lines of Modernism and the dark woodwork of the Victorian era in favour of curves of \\"overwrought iron and Knole sofas, forests of twisted baroque candlesticks and pickled-oak occasional tables with the early southern-German look inspired by the arty Sitwells.\\"York, Peter. The Independent, 20 September 2008 \\"Review of Cartoons & Coronets: The Genius of Osbert Lancaster at The Wallace Collection, London W1, from 2 October to 11 January 2009\\". Retrieved 4 July 2019. Walls were painted pastel colours, often a shade of green, and where the patrons could afford it, at least one \\"feature panel\\" was installed in a room. These were large paintings or murals, often let into the newly repainted panelling, often in the form of trompe l'oeil. In the dining room at Sandringham, the panels were valuable tapestries given by King Alfonso XII of Spain.Country Life: \\"Sandringham ‚Äì The Norfolk home of HM the Queen.\\" 29 May 2008. Externally, with a few exceptions, the revival style was less popular. However, the architect, Clough Williams-Ellis, would adopt a colourful Northern Italianate pastiche Baroque theme as the style for the design of Portmeirion. The late 17th-century Upton House was remodelled by the architect Percy Morley Horder between 1927 and 1929 for the 2nd Lord Bearsted with some external baroque motif, but chiefly the Baroque was confined to the interior. Components of the style A Canaletto (\\"often suspicious\\") was a feature of the scheme. However, for the rich Rex Whistler could provide something similar. Here, a Baroque \\"Capriccio\\" mural at Plas Newydd, the \\"feature panel\\" of the dining room According to Osbert Lancaster, key constituents and elements of Curzon Street Baroque included Venetian hand- painted furniture and art in the style of Canaletto (often of doubtful provenance). An ecclesiastical air could also be employed, which could be achieved by twisted Baroque candlesticks, old leather bound hymn books hollowed out to become cigarette boxes, and ancient gilt prie-dieux transformed into cabinets for the disguising of gramophones. Further objets d'art would include plaster saints suffering torment in coverings of iridescent paint. Lancaster also stated that French furniture, much of it gilt and with cabriole legs, which was such a large part of 17th-, 18th-, and early 20th-century Baroque furnishings, was no longer considered fashionable. Lancaster's own illustration of the style includes a French style occasional table with cabriole legs. However, such furniture was still used within the style by some decorators including Elsie de Wolfe, who worked in a particularly feminine and flamboyant style.Sparke, p.20. An important feature of the style, not always possible due to the expense, was the feature wall. Often this was a trompe l'oeil mural meant to create the Baroque element of surprise and illusion. The era's most celebrated painter of these was Rex Whistler, most notably his Tent Room at Port Lympne and his Italian panorama in the dining room at Plas Newydd of 1938. The setting of such murals and other paintings and tapestries was often in panels rather than frames, a Baroque feature dating from the 17th century. It was also acceptable to mix old and new furniture together in the same room. A further feature, although often not present because of cost or architectural restraints, were wrought iron gates in place of doors or window shutters. Examples Outside of London, Baroque was frequently employed by the newly rich when rebuilding their newly acquired country houses. When the wealthy merchant banker Vivian Smith, 1st Baron Bicester, acquired Tusmore Park, Oxfordshire, in 1929, he immediately brought in the architects Imrie and Angell to sweep away the heavy Jacobean woodwork and introduce a Baroque interior, which culminated in the staircase hall, with a double staircase, heavy with wrought iron, segmented arches, and a gilded chandelier hanging from a ceiling embellished with a gilded starburst.Worsley, p.145 (This house was demolished circa 1960) At Upton House, Lord Bearsted's architect continued his baroque theme within, installing ornate overmantels, columns, panelling, and a curved interior balcony, all in the fashionable pared-back Baroque style.The Gardens Trust Retrieved 17 July 2019 One of the best examples of Curzon Street Baroque can be found in the Italian Drawing Room at Eltham Palace; although the interior is of an art deco design, Curzon Street Baroque was chosen for the principal drawing room. The house, a historic former royal palace, was vastly extended between 1933 and 1936 for Stephen Courtauld and his socialite wife Virginia. In the Drawing Room, their interior designer Piero Malacrida de Saint-August installed all the requisite features of the style, such as antique wrought iron from Spanish churches, acquired from Mayfair antique shops, heavy furniture, and gilt light fittings with parchment lampshades. Disparaging descriptions In 2008 the architectural historian Gavin Stamp described Osbert Lancaster's Pillar to Post (1938)‚Äîlater revised and combined with the sequel Homes Sweet Homes (1939)‚Äîas \\"one of the most influential books on architecture ever published‚Äìand certainly the funniest\\".Stamp, p. 44 Lancaster felt that architects and architectural writers had created a mystique that left the lay person confused, and in the two books he set out to demystify the subject, with, he said, \\"a small mass of information leavened by a large dose of personal prejudice.\\"Lucie-Smith, p. 146 Lancaster, no doubt, intended his description of the new Baroque interiors as 'Curzon Street' to be a gentle criticism, suggesting they were lightweight compared to the original form. He disparaged and renamed other forms of contemporary architecture too, with titles such as Bankers' Baroque, Stockbroker Tudor, and By-Pass Variegated. However, only Curzon Street Baroque stuck and has been used by architectural historians since. Simon Jenkins in his description of the redecoration of Sandringham House in the 1920s and 1930s, when dark Edwardian panelling was painted lighter colours and paintings were fitted into the moulded panels, risked a hypothetical charge of l√®se-majest√© by describing the decoration as Curzon Street Baroque.Jenkins, p. 530 The parodying and disparaging of new architecture and styles in the 1930s was a fashionable thing to do and not confined to Lancaster; Evelyn Waugh mocked the modern movement in his novel Decline and Fall, when he described the new country house of Margot Beste- Chetwynde, King's Thursday, as \\"in the style of a chewing-gum factory.\\" While closer to Curzon Street Baroque, he parodies one of its designers, Lady Sybil Colefax, as the horrendous interior designer Mrs Beaver in A Handful of Dust.The Evelyn Waugh Society, Colossus of Snobbery Retrieved 4 July 2019. =Buggers' Baroque= The bisexual decorator Elsie De Wolfe's music pavilion painted by homosexual artist William Ranken The term \\"Buggers' Baroque\\" was not intended as gentle or even fashionable, witty criticism. \\"Bugger\\" being one of the cruder words for a homosexual, it was an attack on the style and, more pointedly, on those using and employing it. During the 1930s, the unattributed sobriquet Buggers' Baroque was used to describe the style more often than any of the other alternatives. As an attack, it was serious: homosexuality was a crime at the time and carried a prison sentence.So adverse was public opinion to homosexuality that in 1929, when the style was still in its infancy, then Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks threatened to bring legal proceedings against the author Radclyffe Hall unless she withdrew from publication her novel The Well of Loneliness on the grounds that it was gravely detrimental to public interest. However, while a crime in 1930s Britain, homosexuality was more tolerated than it was earlier and later in the century.Waldock, p 1 It was often quietly accepted in the more liberal upper- class, intellectual, and artistic circles.Woods The brother of Sacheverell Sitwell, whose book was the inspiration for the style, the eminent writer and poet Osbert Sitwell, had been in a homosexual relationship since at least 1925, yet remained a close friend of the royal family, frequently moving in the most elite of aristocratic and artistic circles. However, Sitwell's \\"secret\\" was kept far from the public domain.Osbert Sitwell's brother explained, somewhat incredibly, that the royal family liked homosexuals as they were not likely to cause a repeat of the Lady Flora Hastings scandal. See: \\"Osbert Sitwell: desire for life, desire for love\\" Retrieved 15 July 2019 Indeed, it was Osbert Sitwell's famed dining room at his London house which was the apotheosis of the style, with green walls, shell chairs from an 18th- century grotto, verde-antique marble resting on gilded supports with large Baroque masks and a mirror which Sitwell himself, seemingly unaware of the homoerotic undertones, described as \\"with playful black cupids, naked except for neat gold pants.\\"Sitwell, p.167 Whatever the merits of his decor, Sitwell clearly thought his own interior Baroque to be of a higher form than used elsewhere, as in his 1936 poem \\"Rat Week\\", in verse three, he ridiculed the female society decorators deploying the soft palettes of the style, Sybil Colefax and Elsie de Wolfe (also known by her married name, Lady Mendl); both were friends of the abdicated British monarch Edward VIII. :::That gay, courageous pirate crew,It is unlikely that Sitwell was using the word \\"gay\\" to imply homosexuality. The euphemism was not commonly used or understood at the time, and Sitwell, anxious to keep his preferences out of the public domain, never referred to the subject in his writings. See: Osbert Sitwell: desire for life, desire for love Retrieved 15 July 2019 :::With sweet Maid Mendl at the Prow, :::Who upon royal wings oft flew :::To paint the Palace white ‚Äì (and how!) :::With Colefax ‚Äì in her iron cageSibyl Colefax's fondness for royalty and celebrities made her the butt of many jokes. Invited by the cruelly mischievous Gerard Berners to dine with the P.o.W, she accepted with great excitement, but for the amusement of the other guests, Berners seated her next to the dull and socially less significant Provost of Worcester. :::Of curls ‚Äì who longed to paint it beige; Looking back with the benefit of hindsight, it is today known that many of the artisans and their patrons of the 1930s were homosexuals. Besides Osbert Sitwell, another friend of royalty, the celebrated interior designer Elsie de Wolfe (known in Britain as Lady Mendle) had lesbian affairs. The society architect Philip Tilden was a homosexual, as was his patron Philip Sassoon, whose house at Port Lympne, had many Curzon Street baroque features. Patrons of the style often had both their portraits and rooms painted by the homosexual artist William Bruce Ellis Ranken. Whatever the truth of the term, no designer or patron of \\"Buggers' Baroque\\" was ever likely to challenge the accusation as discretion was the key to survival: when William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp, known in society circles to be homosexual, was publicly exposed as a homosexual by his brother-in-law the Duke of Westminster in 1931, he had no option but to flee the country to avoid arrest, spending the remainder of his life in exile. Westminster later wrote him a letter beginning \\"Dear Bugger-in-Law.\\"A. L. Rowse, Homosexuals in History (1977), pp. 222‚Äì223 =Decorators' Baroque= A less damning sobriquet than Buggers' Baroque, Decorators' Baroque was, in truth, a more accurate name because the style was, more often than not, developed by interior decorators rather than architects. Many of the style's components were portable ornaments rather than fixtures and mortar.Hall; 17 October 2018. The rise of the style could also be attributed to the huge increase and popularity in interior decorators: in 1912, the London Post Office Directory listed only four, but by 1920, this number had risen to 122, over 60 of them in Mayfair, close to Curzon Street. Another type of decorator also evolved in this period; these were often furniture dealers too, so it was possible for one decorator to completely alter a room's style, rather than just change the colours of the walls and fabrics, all with minimal stress to the patron. Associated with the style William Ranken who painted many of Curzon Street Baroque's patrons and their interiors. *William Bruce Ellis Ranken (1881‚Äì1941) *Elsie de Wolfe (1859‚Äì1950) *Sybil Colefax (1874‚Äì1950) *Osbert Sitwell (1892‚Äì1969) *Sacheverell Sitwell (1897‚Äì1988) *Osbert Lancaster (1908‚Äì1986) *Rex Whistler (1905‚Äì1944) *Piero Malacrida de Saint-August (1889-1983) *Philip Tilden (1887‚Äì1956) Designed the classical swimming pool and garden at Port Lympne. Decline The outbreak of World War II in 1939 put an end to unnecessary, luxurious redecoration. However, by the time Lancaster had defined Curzon Street Baroque in 1939, he was already documenting other newer styles: Aldwych Farcical‚Äìa pastiche of 19th-century country house interiors; Stockbroker Tudor‚Äìheavy oak furniture and four-poster beds; and Modernistic‚Äìa style today known as 1930s Art deco. It is art deco which today defines the 1930s and came to be seen as \\"expressing all the vigour and optimism of the roaring twenties, and the idealism and escapism of the grim thirties.\\" Curzon Street Baroque was a brief fashion employed by the wealthy, remembered today only because of its survival in a few of their homes, such as Coleton Fishacre, Eltham Palace, and Upton House, Warwickshire.

Reviews Impact Before the establishment of recreational diver certification, the U.S, Navy Diving Manual was used as the training manual for recreational divers in the US, and was frequently referenced in other English speaking countries. It was also used as training material for commercial divers, and has been the standard text for the U.S.Navy for diver training. US Navy decompression tables and variations on the originals have been used worldwide by recreational and professional divers. This trend has decreased somewhat with the availability of economical and acceptably reliable decompression computers. One issue for recreational use was that the Navy decompression tables were considered relatively high risk for decompression sickness when followed to the limit. For divers without convenient recourse to a decompression chamber, this was considered an unacceptable risk, and various modifications to the tables were made for greater conservatism and convenience of use. Even after the recreational diving industry published a variety of training manuals, the U.S.Navy Diving manual remains a respected and widely used reference by recreational technical and professional divers worldwide. This may be partly due to the ease of access, as the later versions have been freely available for download as pdf files.

History  Old narrow gauge Bankura‚ÄìDamodar Railway (also called as Bankura Damodar River Railway) connecting Bankura and Rainagar in Bankura and Bardhaman districts was opened to traffic in sections between 1916‚Äì1917. Controversy = Nameless Railway station of India = The railway station is located at a distance of about 35 km from Bardhaman in West Bengal. This railway station is situated between two villages Raina and Rainagarh. This station located on the railway station Bankura-Massagram rail line was known as Rainagarh. But soon the people of Raina village did not like this thing and a quarrel started between the two villages over the name of the station. The building of this station was constructed on the land of Raina village, so the people of the village believed that Raina should be. The quarrel had reached the Railway Board regarding the name of the station. After the quarrel, the Indian Railways removed the name of the station from all the sign boards installed here, due to which the passengers coming from outside have to face a lot of trouble. Due to anonymity, passengers have to ask other people about it. As the quarrel does not end, the railways still issues tickets for the station from its old name, Rainagarh. People of both villages can tell when the ongoing dispute over the name of the station will end. Trivia: Although there is no name on the station signboard, in official records the station still goes by the name of Raina/Renanagar (RNGR).

The blog focused on science, medicine (especially within psychiatry), philosophy, politics, and futurism. Slate Star Codex was launched in 2013, and was taken down by its author on June 23, 2020, due to fears of having his full name published in an upcoming piece by the New York Times. As of July 22, 2020, the blog was partially back online, with the content restored but commenting disabled. Prior to starting Slate Star Codex, Alexander blogged at the rationalist community blog LessWrong.  Content  The New Yorker states that the sheer volume of content that Alexander has written on Slate Star Codex makes the corpus difficult to summarize, with an ebook collating his posts running to around nine thousand pages. Many of Slate Star Codex posts are detailed reviews of books (typically on a subject in social sciences or medicine) or extensive reviews of scientific literature on a specific topic. The March 2020 blog post ‚ÄúFace Masks: Much More Than You Wanted To Know‚Äù analyzed available medical literature and came to the conclusion that, despite the early guidance by the CDC to the contrary, masks were likely an effective protection measure against COVID-19 for the general public. The blog emphasizes unbiased empirical analysis, and each post is prefaced with a note on \\"epistemic status\\", in which Alexander rates his own confidence in the opinions to follow. = Effective Altruism = Alexander expressed strong support for the effective altruism movement and the pledge to give 10% of one‚Äôs income to charity. Slate Star Codex, along with LessWrong, played an important role in spreading information about the movement and attracting new members. The blog contains discussion of moral questions and dilemmas relevant to effective altruism, such as moral offsets, ethical treatment of animals and trade offs of pursuing systemic change for charities.Chan, R., & Crummett, D.

It is easy to see how such an outcome could be dystopian, but not immediately obvious how we could arrive at it, or lock it in, if most (or all) people do not want it... Meditations on Moloch is a powerful exploration of such possibilities...\\" = Toxoplasma of rage = The blog post \\"The Toxoplasma Of Rage\\" analyzed how controversial and divisive memes spread in media and social networks. In the short story \\"Sort By Controversial\\", Alexander elaborated on the same theme. There he introduced the term \\"Shiri's scissor\\" to describe a statement that has great destructive power because it generates wildly divergent interpretations that fuel conflict and tear people apart. The term has been used to describe controversial topics widely discussed in social media. = Anti-Reactionary FAQ = The 2013 post \\"The Anti-Reactionary FAQ\\" repudiates the work and worldview of the neoreactionary movement, countering in particular the work of Curtis Yarvin. This worldview as of 2013 made claims about natural racial hierarchies and desired the restoration of feudalism. Out of a belief in the superiority of debate over outright bans, Alexander allowed neoreactionary individuals to continue commenting on posts and in \\"culture war\\" threads, as well as engaged through extended dialogues such as the thirty-thousand word FAQ. Alexander's essays on neoreaction have been highlighted by Slate and Vox.  Reception  In 2019, the site was receiving around 20,000 page views per day. It is read both as the largest venue for the rationalist community and among wider audiences. Alexander's departure from LessWrong has been described as one of \\"the main two\\" reasons for a decline in LessWrong's popularity between 2012 and 2016. The New Statesman characterized it as \\"a nexus for the rationalist community and others who seek to apply reason to debates about situations, ideas and moral quandaries.\\" In his 2019 book The AI Does Not Hate You, author Tom Chivers called Slate Star Codex \\"by far the most high-profile part of the movement, and the most overtly political\\", although its readership \\"includes a large number of people I know who absolutely would not call themselves 'Rationalists'.\\" The New Yorker describes Alexander's fiction as \\"delightfully weird\\" and his arguments \\"often counterintuitive and brilliant\\". Economist Tyler Cowen has called Scott Alexander \\"a thinker who is influential among other writers\\". Conor Friedersdorf, writing for The Atlantic, has regularly included articles from the blog in his annual top 100 list of \\"The Best of Journalism\\".  Potential surname dissemination  \\"Scott Alexander\\" is the author's real first and middle name, and the blog's name is based on an approximate anagram of this name. Alexander states that he attempts to conceal his last name for safety and privacy reasons. In June 2020, he deleted all entries on Slate Star Codex, stating that a New York Times technology reporter intended to publish an article about the blog using his full name. According to Alexander, the reporter told him that it was newspaper policy to use real names. The Times responded: \\"We do not comment on what we may or may not publish in the future. But when we report on newsworthy or influential figures, our goal is always to give readers all the accurate and relevant information we can.\\" The Verge cited a source saying that at the time when Alexander deleted the blog, \\"not a word\\" of a story about SSC had been written. The Poynter Institute's David Cohn interprets this event and the furor around it as a flare-up in an ongoing collision in values between the tech and media industries. National Review criticized the Times for applying its anonymity policy inconsistently. The New Statesman said that it was \\"difficult to see how Scott Alexander's full name is so integral to the NYT story that it justifies the damage it might do to him\\", but cautioned that such criticism was based solely on Alexander's own statements as long as the Times was being \\"tight-lipped on the matter\\". An article in Reason agreed with Alexander's rationale regarding the negative impact on his day job as psychiatrist, but criticized his concerns about his personal safety as overblown (arguing that online death threats such as those reported by Alexander \\"are almost never carried out\\"). It said that while \\"publishing information about a person without their permission\\" was standard practice in journalism, \\"it's still hard to see what was about to happen to Alexander as anything other than doxxing\\", and perceived an inconsistency in the Times willingness to accommodate requests for anonymity, contrasting the current situation with a February 2020 article in which the Times did not use the subject's real name. As reported by The Daily Beast, the criticism by Alexander and his supporters caused considerable internal debate among the Times staff. Supporters of the site organized a petition against release of the author's name. The petition collected over six thousand signatures in its first few days, including psychologist Steven Pinker, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, computer scientist and blogger Scott Aaronson, and philosopher Peter Singer.

She did not acquire the Japanese language, and from the beginning of her career as a missionary, she was met with opposition and discouragement but it did not dissuade her. Yet, she organized classes in English language for young men; the Chautauqua Circle was formed and a periodical started; children's meetings and old women's meetings were held; Sunday schools were introduced; a Christian Endeavor Society was organized; and orphanage was started; and a girls' school was opened. Biography America Missouri McCutchen was born in Pilot Grove Township, Cooper County, Missouri, July 23, 1830. Her father, John McCutchen, a Virginian by birth, soon after the close of the American Revolutionary War moved to southern Kentucky and located in what is known as the \\"Cumberland Country\\". Her mother, Annie Motherel, was born in North Carolina, but in early childhood, moved with her parents to Wilson County, Tennessee, and settled near where the city of Nashville, Tennessee now stands. She married Mr. McCutchen in 1806, and they made their home in Kentucky. Mrs. McCutchen was a convert of the \\"great revival of 1800\\", that religious awakening that swept over Kentucky and Tennessee, resulting in the organization of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Mrs. McCutchen was a member of the Woman's Missionary Society organized at Russellville, Kentucky. When about eight years old, Drennan attended school in the neighborhood, accompanied by a male cousin, whose father was Rev. Robert Bell (1770-1853). She was educated at the Missouri Female College in Boonville, Missouri. After graduating, she returned to the same school for a post-graduate course. Career =Teacher= In 1848, while attending the post-graduate course, she became engaged to be married to Rev. Finis Anderson Witherspoon (1826-1863), a young minister of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. They married on September 18, 1850. Mr. Witherspoon was pastor at Kinmundy, Illinois, where he died on October 26, 1863. Subsequently, she returned to her home in Missouri. She had the care of two orphan children, the son and daughter of Mr. Witherspoon's brother, and Drennan's father was growing feeble, so she felt it necessary to stay near him. She secured a position as a teacher in the Missouri Female College. Here, her influence was such that, in a short time, everyone connected with it was converted to Christianity, and a revival started which reached many in the town outside of the school. After the American Civil War, which ended in 1865, she stopped teaching to devote herself to the care of her aged father and the two adopted children. After her father's death, she married Rev. James Alexander Drennan, on January 28, 1868. He was pastor of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church at Lexington, Missouri. He died October 31, 1869. A month later their only child, a son, thirteen months old, died, too. She then began teaching at Lexington, having to provide for the education of two daughters, Mary (b. 1856) and Jane (b. 1863), of Mr. Drennan. With some variation she continued for several years as a teacher, part of the time at Oxford, Mississippi. =Development of the Women's Board of Missions= In the year 1880, when the call came through the papers for the women of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church to organize a Board of Missions, Drennan responded to the call, and met with other women of the church in Evansville, Indiana, for the purpose of considering the matter. The organization was established, and Drennan was made chairman of the committee to select the location of the Board. Not long after this, a member of the Assembly's Board suggested that they ask Drennan to go to the foreign field. Before she accepted, one of the women said, \\"Oh, what good can one of your age do there?\\" One more year passed, and Drennan attended the second meeting of the Board, which convened at Bowling Green, Kentucky. At this meeting, Drennan suggested the organization of synodical and presbyterial societies. She also suggested the circular letter plan that was adopted and used successfully in many of our presbyteries. She was appointed synodical vice president of Missouri, which office she accepted, hoping to find satisfaction in this work. She organized some societies, but the work did not prosper. Again, at McMinnville, Tennessee, she returned to teaching, but this work, formerly something she enjoyed doing, had now become irksome to her. She gave up the school and determined to offer herself to the Board of Missions, with the knowledge that she would have gone even had her application to the Board been rejected. After due consideration by the members of the Board she was accepted. The consecration service was held in the lecture room of the First Cumberland Presbyterian church at Evansville in March, 1883. From there, Drennan hastened on to Missouri to say goodbye to relatives, having already said good-bye to Kentucky friends; her visit to Missouri was saddened by the unexpected death of her oldest sister. After a few days spent with each member of her family, she headed to Kansas City, Missouri, and then spent a week in San Francisco. =Missionary to Japan= Osaka Drennan sailed away on April 19, 1883, reaching Osaka, Japan on May 5, 1883. She was then 53 years old. Though she was thrilled to be in Japan, she was unable speak the language. As soon as her trunks arrived and her room was arranged, she began to look for something to do. Three days after her arrival, three young men came to her and asked to learn English. One of them already had some knowledge of the language, and through him she taught the others. She gave them a book on physiology. In studying this, they were led to talk of the human body and its structure; and from there, she led the conversation to Christianity. The students advanced so rapidly that by June 1st, they had completed the work on physiology, and she put them on the regular Chautauqua course, the book they had studied being the first book of the course for that year. This was the beginning of the Chautauqua work in Japan. She had no idea at the time of its reaching beyond the circle of students in her own room, but within five months after she reached Japan, in October 1883, she had regularly organized the Chautauqua Circle. Knowing that through the young men in her class, she could reach other people, she devoted much time to them, providing them with entertainment and preparing a pleasant room where they could come for recreation. The Chautauqua Circle continued to widen, including men and women, in a short time numbering 1,200 members. Through the influence of this work, many were prompted to send for Bibles. \\"The Mission\\", in speaking of this branch of the work, said: \\"It is of incalculable worth in the work.\\" On July 20, 1883, a Japanese festival was held in the city. Drennan was persuaded by her pupils to go with them to see the exhibit, which was indeed a unique sight to American eyes. It was the festival of the god of that section. All this was extremely interesting to Drennan, and she remained on the streets so long that she was overcome by the heat, and forced to resort to the ever-ready and convenient jinrikisha, to be brought back to her boarding house. She was so prostrated from the sun exposure and crowd that it became necessary for her to leave the city; accordingly, on the last of July she went to the mountains for rest. The stay in the mountains not proving beneficial, she remained only one week, but spent the remainder of the vacation as Kobe, by the seaside. It was a good place to rest. Miyoshi San and others of her pupils visited her at Kobe, and the time was spent in teaching English and learning what she could of the Japanese language. In August 1883, the mission bought a lot on the Concession in Osaka for the purpose of beginning a school. There were three houses on this lot, which were used for dwelling-, boarding-, and schoolhouses. In September, Drennan moved into one of these houses and resumed her classes of young men. These classes increased so rapidly that it became necessary to have afternoon and night sessions. Three times each week during the fall and winter, she held children's meetings in different parts of the city. The three young men who were her first pupils assisted in this work. She first taught the young men the Bible lesson, a picture story, and the songs to sing, and they afterward repeated it all to the children. The rooms were often filled with children, and many grown people stood about the doors, eager to see what it was that pleased the children so much. This work was kept up until stopped by the priests. O Yone Hara San (Daisy) & Drennan The second week of October 1883, Drennan was requested to take for her own a baby who was one year old. She was teaching her Bible class when the parents came to her house with two of their children. The baby, Drennan called Daisy. The boy, whom the parents brought as nurse for the baby, was six years old, and too small, Drennan thought, for such a task, so a nurse was hired. But the boy, Shozo, was allowed to remain and go to school until he grew too large for a girl's school. Then Drennan sent him to his father, who had prospered in business. Daisy was bright, and soon learned to speak English, and to sing and play on the organ. In the fall of 1883, while waiting for the opening of the girls' school, which took place in January, 1884, Drennan organized a Christian Endeavor Society. She was assisted in this work by Nishi San, who was an elder in the church at Osaka. The society grew very rapidly, and soon published a paper for free distribution, called Words of Life. Four hundred copies each month were published. The meetings were held in her rooms. This was the first Christian Endeavor Society in Japan. =Wilmina School for Girls= On January 8, 1884, the Wilmina School for Girls was opened with four pupils, three girls and the little boy, Shozo San. By June, seventeen pupils were enrolled. For some reason, the English-speaking teacher, Drennan's interpreter, was removed, and Drennan was left with no one in the house who could speak to her in English. As she only knew a few Japanese words, she was forced to govern chiefly by signs. The need of more room was of even greater necessity than an interpreter, but it was some time before a new school building was erected to accommodate the rapidly increasing patronage. It was finished and they moved into it on May 19, 1887. From this time, under her management, the school not only paid all expenses, including teachers' salaries, and for all needed furniture and repairs, but at the close of the year, paid a small sum into the treasury of the mission. The following year, she enrolled 45 boarding pupils and 105 day pupils. She began a night class for men in the spring of 1887 on Dojima Island this being one of the many small islands into which the city of Osaka is divided by the two rivers and numerous canals which pass through it. She had a large number of pupils every night studying the Bible after English lessons. She was at this place the night that the school building was burned, on February 8, 1888. She was not permitted to continue work at this place very long on account of the accumulation of school duties, caused by the sickness and retirement of Miss Renzer from the school. There was a fine prospect for building up a good church at Dojima. The Baptists took it soon after Drennan left. Drennan lost everything by the fire, but she had many influential friends, who secured her a home in the city where she lived as their guest, and the next week after the fire, she resumed her school work. By this fire, the school was well advertised, so that there were more day-pupils than before, and notwithstanding the great loss sustained and the want of room which compelled her to give up some of her boarders, it was more than self- sustaining. She kept a strict financial record of the school's standing. Drennan's school work in Osaka ended in 1888. =Woman's class and orphanage= In September, 1885, Drennan organized a woman's class. She first taught them English, cooking, and fancy work, but they soon became interested in Christianity, and came regularly for Bible study. They were chiefly the wives of officers. At first, this class was small, but it grew until it numbered 40. On New Year's Day, 1887, Mr. Soto, who was president of the government revenue department, came to thank her for teaching his wife, and the next week engaged her to teach in the revenue department office. She had 30 pupils among the officers of this department, Mr. Soto being among the number. They were all deeply interested in Christianity. She taught them until the close of the school in 1888. It had long been her wish to establish an orphanage, to be supported by the married women's class, which by now had 30 members. The women worked with Drennan to prepare bedding and clothes for this purpose. They put up a considerable sum of money. Drennan secured government permission, and 13 orphans were brought to the orphanage through legal channels. She had the assurance of the support and assistance of the men in Osaka, who had proffered all the aid she needed in the enterprise. However, this work was deemed inexpedient by the Woman's Board in America, and was abandoned. Nagoya The accumulation of care and work, together with crowded sleeping apartments and bad water, caused her health to fail, and she was compelled to resign from the school. She went to Nagoya with her helper in October 1888, where she engaged in direct evangelistic work. At first there was great opposition to Christianity' in Nagoya because the people thought it was Roman Catholicism, which the government forbade them to believe. But Drennan's tactful plan soon weakened the old prejudice. She obtained permission to organize a women's school. This work began in November with only two pupils, but she knew not discouragement, and very soon, through Bible classes for young men, and inquiry meetings for all, a little church grew, which was organized with ten members in January, 1889. In Nagoya, she left a little church of 30 members, and 13 yen in the bank. Five native preachers grew out of her work. About March 7, 1889, the president of the government school sent an urgent request to Drennan to come to Yokkaichi, a station about from Nagoya. For years, this had been a sealed city, the people saying that no Christian should live there. Drennan responded to the call. The result of this one visit was a class of ten names signed for Bible study. She made weekly visits until a preaching place was opened, and an earnest class of Bible students formed. Miss Rezner then took charge of the work. Ueno and Tsu After the union of all the Presbyterian bodies in Japan, it was thought best that Drennan's church of 30 members, which was now meeting its own running expenses, should unite with the other Presbyterians in Nagoya. Her school was also turned over to them, and Drennan was transferred to Iga-Ueno, a city of 15,000 inhabitants in the interior of Japan. There was no Christian in the province of Iga. She first selected a location for her home, and fitted up a room near-by for a church. Immediately she set about organizing Sunday schools, Bible classes, English classes, and working classes. The people of Ueno did not know of Christianity, but they did know of Drennan's aptness in teaching English, and that was what they wished. At this time, the study of English was quite popular among the upper classes of Japanese. In response to their call she said to them: \\"I will teach you English, because through that I hope to be able to win you to listen to the teachings of the Bible.\\" Her two boys, as she sometimes styled the young men who were her first student in Japan, and whom she had placed in school, helped her whenever they could get a day out of school. These two young men, Kimmura San and Matsuda San, were both studying for the ministry. Work was carried on in five other parts of the city. In September, 1891, with money sent her by two young me from Kentucky, she rented a house in the best part of the city, where the people were wealthy but hard to reach. She had a Sunday school there every Sunday, and preaching every Saturday night, with a woman's meeting on Sunday afternoons. The interest grew, and in a few months, some of the men in high office were interested. It was at this point that she organized what she called her second church. It was named the Mukaijima Church. In May, 1892, the Christian women of Ueno united with Drennan to hold the first annual woman's meeting. In June, 1892, Matsuda San having graduated, he at once became pastor of the church at Ueno. Drennan, at her own expense, had kept him in school six years. She was now relieved of the responsibility of the Ueno work. Instead of going to the mountains for rest, she and her helper secured passports and started for Hida Province. It was three days' travel by jinrikisha after leaving the railroad to the capital of the province, Takayama, and they were detained four days in travel by the breaking of 0 Yone San's jinrikisha. The day that she was sixty- two years old, July 23, 1892, Drennan walked much of the way up the steep mountain side in the rain. There were frequent earthquakes, preceded by rumblings, and ending in explosions. She was the only foreign woman who had ever been in this province, and although the people were very curious, they were never uncivil. The chief of police sent an escort with her when she wished to go out on the streets, lest she might receive rudeness. They seemed to think that she had greatly honored them by her visit. Even the Roman Catholics had never reached this point, and to her it seemed a much neglected but important field. She expected to remain there one month looking over the field, but very soon news came of sickness in the church at Ueno. The young pastor had been called away to see his mother, who was dying, so, without having time to rest from her journey, she was compelled to return to Ueno, feeling that the duty lying nearest now was to comfort her troubled people at home. The result of this visit to Takayama is seen in the establishment of a mission there by the Episcopal Church, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church not feeling able to undertake the work at that time. She returned to Ueno, taking up the work there in the absence of Matsuda San. There were now 12 places for holding service in that city and a church of 60 members. The preachers there were Matsuda San, Ohira, and a licentiate. In September, 1893, she began work at Tsu, the capital of Ise Province. She placed Mr. Kimura in charge of the work at Tsu, while she divided her time, spending half here and half at Ueno. These cities were 60 miles apart. When at Tsu, she slept and ate in Japanese fashion, and had no fire in her room; the winter was intensely cold, and the frequent changes gave her cold, but she kept up this practice of alternating every two weeks until the last of January, when she was compelled to go to Kyoto for treatment. Drennan remained in Kyoto until March 1893, when she returned to her home in Ueno so feeble that her physicians wrote a letter recommending that she go to her native country for health. The Board of Missions wrote her that the time had come for her return. Very soon, a letter came from Drennan saying that she was fully restored to good health. Drennan's work was really not in a condition that she could with propriety leave it at this time. There were four girls whose support had been promised by societies in America, but for some reason had been given up. These she could not turn out into the world uncared for, so she kept up their support herself. She planned a system of village work to be carried out by women, so that every village in Iga was to be visited, and work established wherever there was an opening. As the work was well organized at Ueno, she moved to Tsu in January, 1893, where her life represented the same busy line of teaching, visiting and holding religious service. But with all this, she found time to write letters of instruction weekly to the women of the church at Ueno, and through the Bible class women there kept up the work among the women. =Return to the U.S. in 1893= There was much opposition to Christianity at this place also. Children who attended the Sunday school were threatened by the Roman Catholic priests, and degraded in their classes, and made the butt of ridicule until driven from the school. Notwithstanding the work was so difficult, in a few months, she had established a flourishing church. But the physical condition of Drennan later on made a return to the U.S. imperative. In July 1893, just before leaving Tsu, she wrote that she had succeeded in having all her girls provided for during her absence, and also had arranged her work so that it would not suffer. With Daisy satisfactorily provided for, Drennan left Japan on August 5, 1893, on the steamer Peking, and reached Pueblo, Colorado, August 31, where she remained a few days with her sister. Then she came to Missouri, spending a short time with her brother, before hastening to Franklin, Kentucky, that she might see her aged sister before her death. She remained in the United States until August, 1894, making just one year's absence from Japan. She spoke of the voyage to the U.S. as being restful; and this was the only rest she experienced during her visit as she had speaking engagements at least once a week, visiting 33 towns in 11 different States. =Return to Japan in 1894= Drennan was accompanied to Japan by Mrs. Lyon and Miss Alexander. During the voyage there was a storm in which Drennan fell, striking her side on the edge of a cot. This injury gave her trouble afterwards, but she never complained, even to her relatives. Rev. E. E. Morris and the church in Marshall, Missouri, with the consent of the Board of Missions, undertook the support of Drennan after her return to Japan. But it was never enough. Once back in Japan, Drennan found the church at Tsu in great need of help. The Ueno church had also suffered during her absence; but very soon she secured the services of a good native preacher for the church at Tsu, and a man was placed at Ueno. As soon as Drennan was partially relieved of the care of these two churches, she went to Shiroko, away. There she rented a chapel, fitted it up, and left a young man in charge of the work. With the assistance of Mrs. Lyon, the Bible Training School was opened, Drennan spending three hours each day teaching a Bible lesson, which was repeated many times by the Bible women as they went from house to house. The work at Shiroko met with much opposition from the Roman Catholic priests. She immediately returned to Tsu, and started, with her helper and three other girls, to go the additional ten miles to Shiroko in jinrikishas. They took with them a baby organ. After re- establishing their pastor in Shiroko, Drennan returned the same day to Tsu, in time for her regular work that day consisting of women's meetings; weekly meetings at home for those who would not attend church; Sunday schools, morning and afternoon; morning and night preaching on Sundays; Christian Endeavor Society, and Bible women's class each day. One of the most interesting societies was the old women's class, where none under fifty years old were admitted. Between Tsu, Shiroko, and Ueno, Drennan attended and superintended twelve weekly, five monthly, two semi-monthly meetings each month, with the prospect shortly of opening work in two other towns, this being in addition to Bible Training School, home duties, and general oversight of all the woman's work. In the fall of 1896, in her round of work, Drennan found a family consisting of a mother, two sons and three daughters, all very old and very poor people. They had given a five-year-old girl child a home, not from any feeling benevolence, but with the design of selling her for sex work. With the aid of the chief of police, Drennan secured the child, whom she adopted. The child did not know her name but was called Faith. In the year 1898, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union work was introduced, and a society organized with 20 members. Perhaps the most important new work started that year was the tent work, which began in September, with Mr. Banno preaching and distributing tracts to large audiences in Ueno. In the spring of 1900, at one time every member of Drennan's group, consisting of fifteen girls, had Influenza. She also suffered from two severe attacks from which she was slow to recover. She arranged to accommodate many of the missionaries whom, on account of the plague in Osaka, she knew would wish to spend the summer away from there. Through her influence, a very wealthy man consented to have a number of cottages built near the sea. Drennan succeeded in getting four comfortable cottages built, where the missionaries could have a summer's rest. Her philanthropy did not stop here. She wrote to the consul to send her four or five families of refugees from China, who had barely escaped with their lives. To these she offered places free of rent. In September 1900, Drennan returned from the beach to Tsu, and took up her regular work, opening school on September 17th. In the year 1901, a great wave of religious influence swept over that country, known as the \\"Twentieth Century Movement in Japan.\\" The summer of this year, Drennan regarded as the hottest she had ever known. She had recovered from La Grippe, but she did not go out as much as usual, because more important work came to the house, and she now had well- trained girls who could relieve her of much of the outside labor. =Return to the U.S. in 1902= A letter from the Mission Board in September 1902 said that Drennan should leave Japan in October and not spend another winter in Japan because of having had influenza. Drennan left Japan October 15, 1902, bringing with her two Japanese girls: Daisy, who had been with her from infancy; and O Tsura San. After a rough voyage of ten days, she landed in San Francisco October 28. They stopped at a hotel nearly two weeks, for rest from the voyage. From San Francisco they went to San Jose, California. She next spent ten days with her cousin, Rev. Nathan Motherel, at Hanford, California, before reaching Pueblo, Colorado. Because of these travels, she was sick until Christmas. During January and February 1903, she took a furnished house, and lived there with her two girls. Her sister's home afforded every comfort, and she received all the attention that her family could bestow, yet she thought best to keep house with her Japanese girls for a while, that she might do the necessary writing that had accumulated, without having to appear selfish by withdrawing from the circle of her sister's household. The offer of a furnished house, by a friend, afforded the opportunity, and against the protests of her sister and her family she moved into it and remained two months. At this time it was intensely cold, and she was not often out of the house. In March, she attended Presbytery at Colorado Springs, Colorado. After four days, she returned to her sister, Mrs. Bell, worn out. Another short rest and she went to Ca√±on City, Colorado before returning to her sister's home for more rest. Drennan had planned to attend the meeting of the Woman's Board at Huntsville, Alabama, and also to visit friends in Kentucky and Tennessee. After resting at Pueblo, Colorado, she left May 5, 1903 traveling until she had reached Holden, Missouri, the home of her nephew, Mr. McCutchen. She was unable to continue the journey, and was quite ill until she rallied, and on May 24, accompanied by Mr. McCutchen, she went to Pilot Grove, Missouri, the home of her childhood, to visit Mrs. List, her niece. One of the Japanese girls, Daisy, she left with her sister, Mrs. Bell, at Pueblo, Colorado, but O Tsura San went with Drennan as her companion and nurse. When the rainy season came, Drennan grew listless, was not inclined to talk, and had no appetite. Two weeks before she died, the Drennan Mission Band met at Mrs. List's home. The next day, she canceled an engagement in Texas. Two of her nieces were with her, but O Tsura San was by her bedside constantly. She sent for Mr. McCutchen and spoke to him of her burial, and expressed her satisfaction that he had had the family burying ground put in order. She gave directions for her funeral expenses, and requested that the small amount left over be given to the two Japanese girls, Daisy and O Tsura San. Drennan died June 26, 1903. She was buriedat the old Mt. Vernon cemetery next to her first husband, Rev. Mr. Witherspoon, her father, brother, sister, and other family members.

The park includes amenity grassland, together with a wooded area to the south of the site. Within the park there is a brick-built pavilion with changing rooms and storage space, a basketball court, and a children's play area. This principal access to the park is from Edenham Crescent, a residential street, and the park was previously known as Edenham Crescent Park. Other pedestrian accesses are available from Wensley Road, Swallows Croft and Coley Avenue.  History  The grassland area of the park was formerly part of the Courages Sports Ground, a sports ground belonging to the Courage Brewery in the town. This ground was principally provided for the sport and recreation of the brewery staff, but was also used on occasion by Berkshire County Cricket Club. After the brewery was acquired by the Hanson Trust in 1986, and then sold to Elders IXL in 1990, Hanson separately sold the sports ground site for housing development. As part of that development, part of the sports ground was retained for public use, initially known as Edenham Crescent Park. The southern woodland area of the park has a different provenance, having formed the western end of the Ministry of Agriculture site that had occupied the grounds of Coley House since the Second World War. This was separated from the Courage Sports Ground by a fenced public footpath. After this site was redeveloped at the beginning of the 21st century, the woodland became isolated and derelict, whilst the remains of the sports ground became run-down and subject to anti-social behaviour. A project was formed by Reading Borough Council and the Thames Valley Partnership, working with a community steering group of local residents and the Prison Service, to address this. The renovation of the park was undertaken by prisoners from Reading Prison, which at that time was a Young Offenders Institution. At the same time they cleared the undergrowth from the wooded areas, and removed the fences that separated it from the public footpath and open space, thus creating a single park. Prison and probation officers reported that the project provided the offenders with skills and contacts useful for their resettlement, and the project attracted widespread attention, including the site visit of a delegation from Russia. As a result of a suggestion by a local resident, the enlarged park was formally renamed Courage Park in recognition of its previous ownership and the fact the project ‚Äòtook courage‚Äô to realise.

Biography  Wolfe was born in 1832 near Skibbereen, County Cork, Ireland, which at that time was part of Great Britain. He entered the Church Missionary Society College, Islington, London in 1857. In 1861 he was ordained a deacon at St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral and in December of that year he sailed for Hong Kong from where he was assigned as a missionary minister to Fuzhou, Fujian. He was ordained a priest at St John‚Äôs Cathedral, Hong Kong, in 1863. Wolfe spent the rest of his life in Fuzhou until his death in 1915. He is described as ‚Äúthe chief instrument in the remarkable ingathering in the Fuh-kien Province.‚Äù He was made Archdeacon of Fuzhou in 1887 and Vice-President of the CMS in 1910. He was the first and only Vice-President not to be a Bishop. After his death, the Synod in Fuzhou, with both Chinese and European members decided to commemorate his life and work by building a cathedral in his memory. Christ Church Cathedral (Cangxia Church) was opened in 1927. The dulian running down the left hand side of the entrance translates as \\"With the ancient moon shining upon modern men we commemorate Archdeacon Wolfe who ministered here.\\" Wolfe‚Äôs name in Chinese sounded very like ancient moon and this became the nickname of one who was also known as 'The Fukien Moses'.

Wolfe translated a number of works into the local dialect including the Book of Common Prayer, several catechisms, the Gospel of St Matthew, and the Book of Joshua. He was responsible for the building of a number of churches and schools in Fuzhou and other centres across Fukien. In 1864 Wolfe married Mary Ann Maclehose in Hong Kong. She predeceased him in 1913. Of their family of three boys and three girls, the girls Minnie, Annie and Amy all became missionaries and served in Fuzhou.

Biography  As the first female member of the previously all male Apollo Poet Society, she was a pioneer women in the literary scene in Egypt and an influential modernist. She regularly published in the society's journal, and produced three volumes of her own poetry while in the literary circles. She also created a self-published monthly newsletter, \\"Literary Goals\\" throughout her life. = Early years = Gamila El Alaily was born in 1907 into a very conservative family in al-Mansoura, Egypt, which is located in the country's Nile River Delta region. To spare her family any potential public embarrassment because of her writings, she did not publish using her real name, but, she did become an active young writer. While she was still living in Mansoura, she formed her own literary association called Family of Culture, and established the Writers of Arabism Association and al-Ahdaf magazine. When she moved to Cairo in the 1950s and got married, she established a literary salon hoping to emulate that of the famous writer and salon holder Mayy Ziyadah (1886‚Äì1941), who was credited with spurring Arab language literature through her salon regimen, held at the Ziyadah home in Cairo on Tuesday evenings for 23 years.  Work  According to Radwa Ashour, et. al., female writers at that time experienced restrictive challenges that encouraged many writers, including El Alaily, to write poetry as a way to express their emotions. Some of the other female poets of her time included Rawhiya al-Qallini, Jalila Rida, Malak ‚ÄòAbd al-‚ÄòAziz, SaÔ¨Åya Abu Shadi, Hayfa‚Äô al-Shanawani, and SuÔ¨Å ‚ÄòAbd Allah. According to Ashour, El Alaily and all of these other poets \\"championed self-expression and wrote about love and passion, advocated freedom, broke with the constraints of tradition, and often used images taken from nature.\\" Ashour continues, > \\"Some poets chose to avoid the forbidden zones in their poetry and > restricted themselves to public issues, while others broke taboos and > addressed topics that had long been inaccessible to women. The critical > celebration of 'women‚Äôs poetry' illustrated the extent of society‚Äôs > acceptance or rejection of women‚Äôs entry to the public sphere. On one hand, > women poets were critically acclaimed the more they spoke in a confessional > tone, rebelled, and broke taboos; on the other hand, they were also > subjected to a critical-moral attack that ascribed the popularity of 'the > literature of the liberated, rebel women' to the control that restrictions > and taboos exercised on their minds.\\" = Poetry = Gamila El Alaily was always aware of the difficult social climate in which Egyptian women were writing poetry. She joined the Apollo Group in the 1930s and published her Ô¨Årst collection of poetry, Sada ahlami (The Echo of My Dreams) in 1936. She was known for rebelling against several constraints often imposed on poets, even poetry's traditional form and content; she wrote free verse and prose poetry, as well as lyric poetry that extolled nature's beauty and the eternal natural freedom of the universe and creation. Her passion for nature was not limited to those phenomena that are tangible. Rather, nature became more of an approach and inspiration, becoming a philosophical treatment of existence, life and death. In Egypt, society's conÔ¨Çicting views about the traditional roles of women as they began to \\"storm the bastion of Arabic culture\\" made the path faced by El Alaily and her contemporaries even more difficult and making their success even more remarkable. = Novels = Gamila El Alaily wrote novels, including al-Ta‚Äôir al-ha‚Äôir (The Confused Bird) (1935), in which she directly discussed the relationship between men and women in a society that was rapidly changing. With another novel published in 1947, Arwah tata‚Äôallaf (Souls in Harmony), El Alaily engaged in a cultural battle where she confronted a series of widely accepted ideas held about women by educated men. The novel is set up as a series of letters between an Egyptian writer named Mayy and a revolutionary journalist named Sa‚Äòid.\\" (The author's famous Cairo friend, salon-holder Mayy Ziyadah, conducted a prolific longtime correspondence with poet Kahlil Gibran, which began in 1912 and the letters were later published in several languages. Mayy is thought to have served as inspiration for El Alaily's 1947 book, which was published after Mayy's death in 1941.)Buck, Claire (1992). Bloomsbury guide to women's literature. London: Bloomsbury. . OCLC 185786618. = Magazines = She also published in al-Nahda al-Misriya, a women‚Äôs magazine, and in al-Mar‚Äôa al-Misriya and her poems appeared in Abullu.  Selected publications  According to WorldCat there are 16 books authored by Gamila El Alaily (using the spelling Jamila al-'Alayili), all in Arabic, that are held libraries worldwide as of 2020. * al-RƒÅ ªiyah: majm≈´ ªat qi·π£a·π£, [Alexandria]: [al-Ma·π≠ba ªah al-FƒÅr≈´qƒ´yah], [193-?] * al-·π¨ƒÅ ºir al-·∏•ƒÅ ºir, Mƒ´t Ghamr: Ma·π≠ba ªat WƒÅdƒ´ al-Nƒ´l, 1935 * Hindƒ´yah, [Cairo]: DƒÅr al-Ta ºlƒ´f, [between 1900 and 1999] * ·π¢ad√° a·∏•lƒÅmƒ´, al-Iskandarƒ´yah: Ma·π≠ba ªat al-Ta ªƒÅwun, [1936] * al-Amƒ´rah, al- FajƒÅlah: Ma·π≠ba ªat Sa ªd Mi·π£r, 1939 * Ras≈´l al-Ras≈´l JalƒÅlat al-Malik KhƒÅlid ibn  ªAbd al- ªAzƒ´z, Malik al-Mamlakah al- ªArabƒ´yah al-Sa ª≈´dƒ´yah, [publisher not identified], [1978] * ƒ™mƒÅn al-ƒ´mƒÅn, [Cairo]: Ma·π≠ba ªat al-·π¢ƒÅwƒ´, [19--] * al- NƒÅsik, [Cairo]: al-Hay ºah al-Mi·π£rƒ´yah al- ªƒÄmmah lil-KitƒÅb, 1972 * Bayna abawayn: qi·π£·π£ah, [Cairo]: al-Majlis al-A ªl√° lil-ThaqƒÅfah, 1981 * Naba·∏çƒÅt shƒÅ ªirah: shi ªr, [Cairo]: al-Hay'ah al-Mi·π£rƒ´yah al- ªƒÄmmah lil-KitƒÅb, 1981 * Bayna abawayn: qi·π£·π£ah, [Cairo]: al-Majlis al-A ªl√° lil-ThaqƒÅfah, 1981 * Naba·∏çƒÅt shƒÅ ªirah: shi ªr, [Cairo]: al-Hay'ah al-Mi·π£rƒ´yah al- ªƒÄmmah lil-KitƒÅb, 1981 * Hindƒ´yah, [Cairo]: DƒÅr al-Ta ºlƒ´f, [between 1900 and 1999] * Jamƒ´lah al-  ªAlƒÅyilƒ´ tuqaddimu Qa·π≠arƒÅt min al-·∏•ubb al-ilƒÅhƒ´.

Ivanic described the type species from honey bees. Morphology and life cycle Nephridiophaga spores are small, flattened ovals that resemble a red blood cell. Each spore contains a single nucleus and may have an inconspicuous, central opening. Spores are ingested by insects. Once inside the host, spores germinate, though whether in the gut or elsewhere is not known.Plasmodia inhabit and feed on Malpighian tubule cells where they are in direct contact with the cytoplasm. Multi-nucleate plasmodia are eventually released into the lumen, some attach to the brush border of the tubule cells using pseudopodia that interdigitate with the microvilli of the cells. Other plasmodia form merozoite-like cells. Plasmodia released into the lumen form sporoblasts internally with a spore wall enclosing each nucleus. Sporoblasts can be asexual or sexual. Asexual sporoblasts are formed from a type of closed mitosis with chromosomes un-condensed and spindle poles remaining un-connected to the nuclear envelope, which is a common form of mitosis for fungi. Sexual sporoblasts are formed after the fusion of meiotic nuclei; however, the details of meiosis and fusion are not known, and the phenomenon is doubted by some authors. Spores are excreted from the insect in its feces. Taxonomy Nephridiophaga was originally placed in the protist order Haplosporidia, though not all researchers agreed with some placing them in the Microsporidia, and others leaving them unclassified. Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the species infecting cockroaches belong to the kingdom Fungi.

The film is directed by Oz Perkins, and produced by Fred Berger, Brian Kavanaugh-Jones, and Dan Kagan, with a screenplay by Rob Hayes. Sophia Lillis and Sam Leakey portray the title characters, alongside Charles Babalola, Jessica De Gouw, and Alice Krige. The story follows Gretel and Hansel as they enter the dark woods in order to find work and food, and then stumble upon the home of a witch. It was announced in October 2018 that Orion Pictures had started developing Gretel & Hansel, a film adaptation based on the German folklore Hansel and Gretel by the Brothers Grimm, with Perkins directing the film from a screenplay he co-wrote with Hayes. At the same time, Lillis was set to star in the film, with other actors being added shortly after, and filming taking place between November and December 2018 in Dublin, Ireland. Gretel & Hansel was released in North America on 31 January 2020 by Orion Pictures through United Artists Releasing. The film grossed $21 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its visuals and cinematography, as well as the horror elements and acting, but criticism for the film's pacing. Plot A baby girl in a village falls ill and is not expected to survive. The father takes the child to see an enchantress, who removes the illness but leaves power within the girl. The villagers go to the girl, as she grows up, to hear her premonitions, but she uses her power to kill people, including her father. She is taken into the woods to be abandoned. There, she lures other children to their deaths. She becomes known as the Beautiful Child. The scene shifts to teenaged Gretel (Sophia Lillis) and her younger brother, Hansel, after their father's death. They meet a man about a housekeeping job, but he reveals his true intentions by asking Gretel if she is still a virgin. The children leave without work. Their mother rebukes Gretel for not helping provide for them and threatens to kill Gretel if they do not leave the house. The siblings flee and find a hut to stay for the night, but a ghoulish man appears and attacks Hansel. A hunter (Charles Babalola) saves the siblings and takes them to his home. The next morning, the siblings go out to forage and seek work. Hansel is drawn to a house with the smell of cake coming from it. Holda (Alice Krige) invites them inside for a meal and allows them to sleep there in exchange for work. Holda sends Hansel to the woods to practice his skills with an axe while keeping Gretel indoors. Hansel is happy but Gretel grows suspicious of Holda. She sees a vision of the Enchantress and hears children's voices. Holda shows Gretel how to tap into her powers as a witch. Hansel also sees a vision of the Enchantress and an inverted pentagram carved into a tree. Gretel enters Holda's cellar, where Hansel sits entranced. The floor floods with blood and a younger witch emerges, emptying buckets of guts and placing a dismembered child's arm onto the table before turning this into the food that Holda feeds the siblings. The next day, Gretel watches Holda eat and sees her pull a lock of human hair out of her mouth. Through visions, Holda reveals she is the mother of the Beautiful Child. The child promised to share her powers with Holda if the latter trusted in the darkness. Holda devoured her other children and took on the guise of a kind, old woman to lure other children. Holda straps Gretel down in the cellar. With her youthful appearance, Holda lures Hansel into a cage so she can cook him. Gretel uses her powers to pin Holda over the flames. Holda is killed by the fire, exacerbated by Gretel's powers, breaking Hansel's trance and Gretel's bonds. Gretel decides to remain at the house. Hansel returns to their family home, discovering that their mother is no longer there and reclaiming his own axe. Gretel sees the spirits of the dead children emerge from the trees, finally free. Her fingers start to turn black as Holda's did, but she states she will trust herself and control her newfound abilities. Cast * Sophia Lillis as Gretel, a 16-year-old girl and Hansel's older sister. * Sam Leakey as Hansel, Gretel's 8-year-old brother. Leakey is making his acting debut. * Charles Babalola as The Huntsman, a young man who helps Gretel and Hansel early in the story. * Alice Krige as Holda / The Witch, a terrifying and powerful evil witch who lives in the shadows of the dark wood and kidnaps Gretel and Hansel. **Jessica De Gouw as Young Holda * Giulia Doherty and Beatrix Perkins (uncredited) as The Beautiful Child * Fiona O'Shaughnessy as the Mother * Donncha Crowley as Master Stripp * Melody Carrillo as the Enchantress * Jonathan Delaney Tynan as the Father * Ian Kenny as Knight * Abdul Alshareef as Knight * Manuel Pombo as Knight * Loreece Harrison as The Demoness Production In October 2018, the Hollywood Reporter wrote that Orion Pictures had started developing a film adaptation of the German folklore tale Hansel and Gretel, with Oz Perkins directing a screenplay he had co-written with Rob Hayes, and Sophia Lillis starring as the lead character. Sinister producer Brian Kavanaugh-Jones and The Autopsy of Jane Doe producer Fred Berger, partners at Automatik Entertainment, were announced as producers, with Sandra Yee Ling and Macdara Kelleher as executive producers. Hayes eventually received sole screenplay credit. In November 2018, Charles Babalola was cast as the Hunter, a new character who helps Gretel and Hansel navigate the woods. In April 2019, Alice Krige, Jessica De Gouw, and Sam Leakey joined the cast, with Leakey making his acting debut. Perkins explained in an interview that the title was changed because this version focuses on Gretel: Principal photography on the film began on 9 November 2018 in Dublin, Ireland, and wrapped up in December 2018. Additional filming and reshoots started in January 2019 in Langley, British Columbia, Canada. =Music= The chilling and frightening score was composed by Robin Coudert, also known by his stage name, Rob. With the soundtrack in mind, Rob avoided using typical symphonic orchestral themes to create a unique film score saying, ‚ÄúI find it essential to create melodies that we can sing or whistle as, in horror cinema, it is usually the opposite, where the music rather has a tendency toward structure and abstraction. For this project, which is a film about kids, it seemed important to have that.‚Äù The soundtrack was released by Waxwork Records in 2020 as a single LP. Release The film was released on 31 January 2020 by United Artists. =Home video= Warner Bros. Home Entertainment (under license to MGM Home Entertainment) released the film digitally on 7 April 2020, and on DVD and Blu-ray on 5 May 2020. Reception =Box office= In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside The Rhythm Section, and was projected to gross $4‚Äì7 million from 3,000 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $2.3 million on its first day (including $475,000 from Thursday night previews). It debuted to $6.1 million, finishing fourth. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 65% based on 98 reviews, with an average rating of 6.40/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"Gretel & Hansels rich visuals satisfy, even if this adaptation of a classic fairytale gets a little lost in the woods on the storytelling front.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C‚àí\\" on an A+ to F scale. Contrarily, Andrew Barker of Variety wrote, \\"The film certainly looks nice, with a wealth of eye-catching compositions,\\" but added, \\"The problem is that so many of its virtues feel compromised.\\" Kimber Myers wrote for The Los Angeles Times, \\"While [Perkins] offers a stunning feast for the eyes, the substance is likely to leave viewers still hungry.\\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment- arts/movies/story/2020-01-30/gretel-hansel-review-horror-osgood-perkins Chandler Levack from The Globe and Mail wrote, \\"Everything about Gretel & Hansel is weirder, smarter and way more cinematic than I'd expected, thanks to some fascinating movie choices made by director Oz Perkins.\\" Kate Rife from The A.V. Club wrote, \\"If one of the boundaries being tested in this film is viewers' patience, the reward for‚Äîto use a refrain repeated throughout the film‚Äî'trusting the darkness' is well worth the commitment.\\" Frank Sheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"Gretel & Hansel may alienate some horror movie fans with its extremely leisurely pacing and emphasis on atmosphere and mood rather than visceral shocks. But while the film certainly demands patience, it provides ample rewards with its lush stylization.\\" Mark Kennedy of the Associated Press wrote, \\"Gretel & Hansel is as visually arresting as it is tedious, a 90-minute movie that really should have been a 3-minute music video for Marilyn Manson or Ozzy Osbourne. It's in the horror genre only loosely. It's more eerie, if that's a genre. Actually, it's like dread for 90 minutes. It's dreadful.\\" Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times labeled the film \\"Essentially the story of a young woman coming into her power, Gretel & Hansel is quietly sinister, yet too underdeveloped to truly scare.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/movies/gretel-and-hansel-review.html References External links  Category:2020 fantasy films Category:2020 films Category:2020 horror films Category:2020s fantasy films Category:American fantasy films Category:American films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian supernatural horror films Category:Dark fantasy films Category:English- language films Category:Films about cannibalism Category:Films about witchcraft Category:Films based on Hansel and Gretel Category:Films directed by Oz Perkins Category:Films shot in Ireland Category:Films shot in Vancouver Category:Folk horror films Category:Irish films Category:Irish supernatural horror films Category:Orion Pictures films ","title":"Gretel &amp; Hansel"},{"id":"61211156","text":"Thyra Frank (born 10 May 1952) is a Danish nurse and politician.

Flynn, Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Patrick Kennedy, Front row Darryl Williams, Director of Handicapped Affairs Commission Charles Sabatier and Darryl Stingley (9501950391) Darryl K. Williams (January 28, 1964 - March 28, 2010) of Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts and Milton, Massachusetts was an advocate for social justice, compassion and forgiveness as well as a local advocate for accessibility for persons with disabilities. As a 15 year old African-American living in Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts, Williams became the victim of a school shooting on September 28, 1979 in Charlestown, Massachusetts while playing at a high school football game. Williams survived the shooting by three Irish American teenagers but was paralyzed from the neck down. Protests, rallies and school walkouts ensued and racial tensions in Boston escalated in the aftermath. Boston mayor Kevin White and other local, state and federal officials promised the Williams family long term financial help, but over the decades that help was limited to Medicare, private donations and fundraisers. Despite his misfortunes, Williams earned a high school diploma and a bachelor's degree and spoke to many thousands of Boston area high school students and others about gun violence and social justice in sports. Darryl was given scholarship awards and many civic honors. Williams over the decades helped countless high school students and adults in and around Boston learn to accept persons of other races. Joe Malone, the Massachusetts State Treasurer in the 1990s, gave Williams a job at the Massachusetts State Lottery where he worked for many years. Also, when Richard E. Lapchick founded Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport In Society he gave Williams a position where he gave presentations on violence prevention to high school students. Richard Lapchick could relate to Williams as both Lapchick and Lapchick's father were the victims of sports related hate crimes. Richard Lapchick, Smashing Barriers, (Lanham, MD: Madison Books, 2001), 3-5. Williams wrote two unpublished works which are generally autobiographical: \\"An Inadvertant Hero\\" is registered at the United States Copyright Office, and \\"Triumphant\\" is an unfinished memoir. Richard E. Lapchick, a former professor at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts and a longtime friend of Darryl Williams, described Darryl in an ESPN.com article as an advocate for social justice, compassion and forgiveness in a city that faced racial tensions throughout his lifetime. Besides Lapchick, who started a memorial fund in Darryl's name, Williams counted among his friends and supporters Muhammad Ali the champion boxer, Joe Malone, the former Massachusetts State Treasurer, many high school students in and around Boston, fellow employees and his local church parishioners.  Early life  Williams was born in Boston on January 28, 1964. His family included his mother and one sister with whom he lived all his life. Growing up in the neighborhood of Roxbury within the city of Boston in Massachusetts, Williams attended services at Eliot Congregational Church which was walking distance from their home. As a teenager in the late 1970s, he attended Jamaica Plain High School. The high school was not his first choice, but because of court ordered school busing in effect at the time in Boston he was assigned there. As a sophomore, he played for the school's varsity football team. He liked playing guitar and dreamed of becoming a college and a professional football player one day.  School shooting  = Events Leading Up To Shooting = On Friday, September 28, 1979, Darryl Williams was playing for the first time as a wide receiver on Jamaica Plain High School's (JP) football team. The team traveled to the neighborhood of Charlestown in Boston, Massachusetts to play against Charlestown High School. There were notable racial tensions exacerbated by four years of court ordered school busing in Boston during the mid and late 1970's. The predominantly white neighborhood of Charlestown was not considered hospitable to African American teenagers such as Williams. The ethnic makeup of Charlestown High School at the time was mostly working class Irish and other Europeans whereas at Jamaica Plain High School the makeup was more diverse with many African Americans as well as Europeans. The respective football teams reflected this difference. Despite the differences and tensions, the teams met and began playing. = The Shooting = Late in the 2nd quarter, Williams caught his first pass ever in a high school varsity football game. His reception led to a score for Jamaica Plain High School. The 2nd quarter ended soon afterward, and it was halftime. The team opted to stay outside during halftime instead of going to the guest locker room. Williams and his team huddled together near the end zone, celebrated Williams' reception and their 6-0 lead. The football coach started giving a pep talk. Meanwhile, across the street about 300 yards away, three Irish American teenage boys living in a nearby housing project perched on the roof of an empty apartment building. One of the teenagers had recently found a loaded pistol and was ready to test it. He fired the gun once in the direction of the football field. The boy who fired the gun later claimed to be shooting at pigeons, but one of the other boys disputed this. The bullet went between Williams' shoulder pads and helmet and lodged in the back of his neck. Darryl fell to the ground unconscious in front of his teammates. The noise from the shot echoed against nearby buildings. Darryl's teammates, fearing more shooting, fell to the ground as well. One of the teammates noticed Darryl was unconscious and called out for help. Emergency responders arrived immediately. When Williams awoke, he was unable to feel anything below his neck. = The Aftermath = Emergency responders put Williams into the ambulance from the football field.https://bostonglobe.newspapers.com/search/#ymd=1979-09-29 The Boston Globe, September 29, 1979, Page A1, \\"Player Shot on Field in Charlestown\\" However, the ambulance went to Boston City Hospital in the South End neighborhood of Boston for treatment even though Massachusetts General Hospital in the West End was much closer. Darryl was paralyzed from the neck down and confined to a motorized wheelchair. Back in Charleston, both football teams left the stadium and never played the second half of the game. After a massive two day manhunt, the teenagers involved were found and arrested. The next day, Pope John Paul II arrived in Boston for a pastoral visit, and shortly after that on October 3rd a large rally of thousands of adults and high school students was held in front of City Hall in support of Williams. Several local and state politicians visited Darryl and his mother at Boston City Hospital during his recovery there and promised their support. The 3 teenage suspects were charged in the shooting and sent home after posting bail. With racial tensions and fears of more violence, Charlestown High School did not play another home football game for nine years. In Jamaica Plain High School's 1981 yearbook, it is noted that a Darryl Williams week was commemorated at the school in Williams' honor. The two older suspects including the shooter were convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison. The third and youngest one, a 16 year old at the time, was tried in juvenile court and found not guilty. While in prison, the shooter told an interviewer that he was aiming at pigeons, not people. Williams and his family disputed the shooter's claim, and at one point the youngest admitted to a reporter that they were not shooting at birds. Williams moved with his family to a wheelchair accessible home in Milton, Massachusetts in the early 1980s. The Freedom House of Roxbury, Massachusetts owned the house at the time and allowed Williams and his family to move there. Williams remained at the home for the next 30 years until the time of his death.  Adult life  = Introduction = During a time of racial tensions, Darryl and his family opted not to use inflammatory rhetoric which could lead to more violence. Instead, he preached forgiveness whenever he could, and he advocated for peace and racial harmony. About the shooting, Williams said, ‚ÄúWhite people did not shoot me. Three white people shot me.‚Äù Richard Lapchick, who also knew Nelson Mandela well, described Williams as \\"'America's lesser-known Nelson Mandela.' Like Mandela, he had every reason to hate white people. Instead, he loved all people.\\" = Education and Career = Williams attended the Massachusetts Hospital School (Pappas Rehabilitation School in Canton, Massachusetts) and earned a high school degree from Boston Public Schools. With the help of a President's Scholarship, he then earned a bachelor's degree from Northeastern University in Boston. Darryl was given a computer which responded to his verbal commands so that he could write. Joe Malone as Massachusetts State Treasurer hired Williams to work for the Massachusetts State Lottery. = Rights Activism = In 1984, Richard Lapchick hired Williams as a motivational speaker. Williams spoke to thousands of high school students about compassion, understanding and forgiveness in the face of violence in schools and racial tensions in Boston. He also advocated often for wheelchair accessibility in public places. He made friends with sports writers such as Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe and sports figures such as boxer Muhammad Ali. Ali called Darryl the \\"Second Greatest\\" after visiting him in 1991. = End of Life = Williams died in his sleep at his home in Milton on March 28, 2010. Since then, several articles about Williams' life and accomplishments have been written by sports writers and several others. Richard Lapchick started a memorial fund in memory of Darryl Williams to help his family.

In the Battle of Lake Erie on September 10, 1813, Tiffany is said to have heroically shielded Perry as they transferred command from the damaged USS Lawrence to the USS Niagara. Early life It is believed that Tiffany was born in 1738 to Nathan Tiffany and Sarah Harvey and later served in the American Revolutionary War. Tiffany was accomplished at the fife and he may have performed in the tent of George Washington. He then lived as a free black man in Taunton, Massachusetts with his wife and son. It is in Taunton that he met Oliver Hazard Perry. Battle of Lake Erie By the time of the War of 1812, Tiffany was an elderly man known as \\"Old Tiffany\\" and served as Commodore Perry's personal servant. During the tumultuous battle on Lake Erie, Perry commanded Tiffany to stand with a musket on the berth deck and make sure no soldiers avoided fighting by staying below deck. After staying by Perry's side for the full battle, Tiffany continued to serve with Perry. Some accounts say he stayed with Perry until Perry's death in 1819, while other records show that Tiffany died aboard the USS Java in 1818 and was buried at sea. It has been estimated that approximately 10 percent of the sailors aboard Perry's ships were black men. Because of their experience in maritime trades, African Americans possessed skills that greatly helped Perry's campaign on Lake Erie. Other black sailors in the battle include Jesse Williams and Newport Hazard, who were both wounded in action. Several others were killed, including Jesse Walls and Isaac Hardy. Those who survived had varying experiences later ‚Äî Williams was given a silver medal from the state of Pennsylvania for his service, but ship boy Jack Russell had to turn over his prize money to his master George Mason upon returning home. Legacy Tiffany's actions are rarely mentioned in general tellings of the Battle of Lake Erie. Around 1943, a mural including Tiffany next to Perry was painted by Martyl Langsdorf in the Recorder of Deeds building in Washington, D.C.. More recently, scholars such as Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Gene Allen Smith have included him in their research.

He completed his schooling in 1941 and then undertook a two-year commercial apprenticeship in industry. Between 1943 and 1945 he undertook his military service in the German army. One result of the end of the war in May 1945 was an end to twelve years of Nazi dictatorship. The Communist Party was no longer banned. Later that year Jarowinsky joined it. In April 1946 a contentious political merger took place between the Communist Party of Germany and the Social Democratic Party of Germany. The resulting merged party became known as the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED). It has never been entirely clear whether those behind the party merger intended that it should take effect across the whole of Germany: in reality its impact was restricted to the regions administered as the Soviet occupation zone. Backers of the merger pointed to the events of 1933, insisting that the Hitler Adolf Hitler's take-over had been possible only because of divisions between the two main parties of the political left. Werner Jarowinsky was one of more than a million communist party members who lost no time in signing their party membership across to the new SED, which by 1949 had become the dominant political force in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. During 1945 and 1946 Jarowinsky was based in Zeitz (south of Leipzig) as a \\"Youth official\\" (\\"Jugendfunktion√§r\\"). He was also employed during this period by the People's Police, though it is not clear from sources whether he was a \\"member\\" of the police or working as an administrative support official. At the same time, from 1945 till 1947, he was able to study with the \\"Workers' and Peasants' Faculty\\" attached to Halle University in order to complete his hitherto truncated schooling. Werner Jarowinsky passed his School Final Examinations (Abitur) in 1947, which opened the way to university-level education. He studied Economics and Jurisprudence at the universities of Halle and Berlin between 1948 and 1951. During that time, in October 1949, the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). It was in this new version of Germany that Werner Jarowinsky now pursued his studies and built his career. He remained at Berlin with a junior teaching position (als \\"Dozent\\") between 1951 and 1956. However, when in June 1956 he received his doctorate, it came from the Karl Marx University (as it had been rebranded and relaunched in 1953) in Leipzig. His dissertation concerned the \\"Functions of Planning of Socialist Trade in the German Democratic Republic and the underlying principals for the state planning of frontline merchandising\\". In 1956 Jarowinsky was appointed to head up the \\"Research Institute for Inter-German Trade\\" (\\"Forschungsinstituts f√ºr den Binnenhandel\\"), which was part of the Economics faculty at Berlin University. In 1957 he became Head of National Administration (\\"Leiter der Hauptverwaltung\\") at the East German Ministry for Trade and Supplies (\\"Ministerium f√ºr Handel und Versorgung\\"), which had connections to the university institute. Further promotion followed in 1959 when he became \\"Deputy Minister\\" or \\"Secretary of State\\" (sources differ over the job title) In succession to Franz Fillinger. Jarowinsky remained in office at the ministry till 1963. The Sixth Party Conference of the SED was held in East Berlin during the third week in January 1963. Werner Jarowinsky was among those elected to membership of the Party Central Committee. It was quite usual for Central Committee members to join only after their names had been on the list of candidates for membership during a period of several years. Indeed, the names of many candidates never progressed beyond the candidates' list. There is no indication in the sources consulted that Jarowinsky's admission to Central Committee membership was delayed in this way. However, at that same Sixth Party Conference his name was placed on the (much shorter) list of candidates for future promotion to Politburo membership. Within the Central Committee, on 1 November 1963, Jarowinsky was elected to a secretaryship with responsibility for Trade and Supplies. Later \\"Church Questions\\" were added to his portfolio of central committee responsibilities. In May 1984 he finally joined the Politburo, serving as a member till December 1989. Between September 1963 and 1990 Jarowinsky also sat as a member of the People's Parliament (Volkskammer). Care had been taken to ensure a semblance of multi- party plurality in the People's parliament, but Jarowinsky is listed throughout as a member representing the ruling SED (party) itself. Between 1971 and 1989 he chaired the parliamentary committee for Trade and Supplies. During the later 1980s, Werner Jarowinsky also became the East German representative on the editorial team producing \\"Problems of Peace and Socialism\\", an international academic journal containing jointly-produced content from Communist and workers' parties and published in Prague, albeit with an editor-in-chief from the Soviet Union. His contributions indicate that, in common with the aging membership of the East German politburo more generally, Jarowinsky was not enthusiastic about winds of change arriving in the editorial offices after 1986 from, of all places, Moscow. In November 1989, the Berlin Wall was breached by large numbers of East German street protestors. To the surprise of commentators (and others) it quickly became apparent that the Soviet troops observing events had received no instructions to intervene. Seeing this, the protestors got sledgehammers and began demolishing the wall. A succession of events now unfolded which led - seemingly inexorably - to East Germany's first and last free election. To Chancellor Kohl of West Germany, who had already had opportunities to discuss the situation with President Gorbachev in some detail, it may already have been apparent that the way was opening up to reunification. For most people that was not yet so obvious. Nevertheless, during November and December 1989 the East German political establishment underwent a terminal loss of collective confidence, while East German citizens cautiously concluded that they were not, after all, about to experience a re-run of 1953. The Party Central Committee and Politburo (including Jarowinsky) resigned en masse on 3 December 1989. That was the context in which, in November 1989, Werner Jarowinsky had become a deputy president of the People's Parliament (Volkskammer). Between 11 November 1989 and 10 January 1990 he also served as leader of the SED parliamentary group in the People's Parliament (Volkskammer). On 11 January 1990, the withdrawal of Jarowinsky's parliamentary mandate was confirmed. His leadership responsibilities in the Volkskammer were taken over by his party comrade K√§te Niederkirchner. On 21 January 1990, Werner Jarowinsky was excluded from the party, which by this time had rebranded itself as the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) and embarked on a desperate scramble to reinvent itself for a more conventionally democratic future. The process of German reunification was rapid. The free election in East Germany was won by the East German CDU (which acted as the East German wing of the West German party of the same name for that election) specifically because it promised speedy reunification. Although they won the election, they did not win enough seats to govern the Volkskammer. A coalition government with the CDU and several other parties was formed to govern and lead the talks for formal reunification.https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/10/world/upheaval-in-the-east- east-germans-form-grand-coalition.html In September, the reunification treaty was passed by both the Volkskammer in East Berlin and the West German Bundestag in Bonn and it was agreed that the formal reunification would be effective from 3 October.http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~rdalton/germany/ch2/chap2.htm This event happened as planned and merged not only Germany but also East Berlin and West Berlin (until then, an enclave controlled by West Germany) into modern-day Berlin. On 22 October 1990, Werner Jarowinsky died aged 63 in reunified Berlin. He outlived East Germany by only 19 days.

The design replaced the Catalina 36 Mark II in the company line. Production The design was built by Catalina Yachts in the United States, but it is now out of production. Design The Catalina 375 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of solid, hand-laid knitted fiberglass, with vinyl ester resin and an integral structural grid. There are balsa cores on the cabin top and decks. There is no structural wood on the design. It has a fractional sloop rig, a raked stem, a rounded, walk- through reverse transom with a swimming platform, an internally mounted spade- type rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed fin keel or optional wing keel. It displaces and carries of lead ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel and with the optional shoal draft keel. The boat is fitted with a Japanese Yanmar diesel engine of . The fuel tank holds , the fresh water tank has a capacity of , plus a holding tank of . There are compartments for generator and air-conditioning units. The design features two cockpit-mounted Harken 44 jib winches and two additional electric winches on the cabin top for the mainsail and halyards. There is a split anchor locker designed to hold two anchor rodes, raised by a Maxwell 1000 windlass. The standard factory-supplied rig includes an in-mast furling mainsail equipped with vertical battens. The cabin woodwork is of teak, with a cabin sole made from Lonseal. The gallery is located on the starboard side at the foot of the companionway steps. A cabin with a queen-sized berth is located aft. The main cabin has a folding table and settees, plus a folding bench seat. The forward \\"V\\"-berth is an island queen-style and includes a head with a shower. Operational history In a Cruising World review in 2008, Mark Pillsbury praised the design's interior, fittings and handling under sail and power. A 2008 Sail magazine report said of the handling, \\"We had 12 knots of warm Florida breeze, flat water, and lots of time to put the boat through its paces. Unlike many new boats that fly blade jibs and large mains with fat roaches, the 375 flies a conservative in- mast-furling main and an overlapping (135 percent) jib. The benefits of this configuration speak for themselves. Sailhandling is easy, and there‚Äôs still plenty of sail-area horsepower. Upwind during our sail, speeds hovered around 6 knots and crept up to the low 7s when I drove for maximum speed in the puffs. We tacked through 85 degrees, and I could have pinched a little higher (and sacrificed a little speed) if I needed to. Tacking the jib requires more winch grinding than a smaller blade jib would, but it‚Äôs hardly a problem. On a beam reach we were trucking along in the 7-knot range as easy as you please. The helm was smooth, and so was our motion through the water.\\" Yacht designer Robert Perry reviewed the design in 2008 for Sailing Magazine and noted, \\"The hull form shows a fine entry coupled with plenty of beam aft. The L/B is 2.87, which indicates a beamy boat, but relatively speaking the 375 is slightly less beamy than the rest of the Catalina series. The research group determined that the freeboard of the boat should be similar to that of the 36, giving the new boat more classic proportions and avoiding the exaggerated high freeboard of many of today's current production models.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Related development *Catalina 36 Similar sailboats *C&C; 38 *Columbia 38 *Eagle 38 *Hunter 38 *Hunter 376 *Hunter 380 *Hunter 386 *Landfall 38 References Category:Keelboats Category:2000s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts ","title":"Catalina 375"},{"id":"61212002","text":"Jalal Abdul-Rahman (born 6 May 1944) is a former Iraqi football goalkeeper who played for Iraq in the 1976 AFC Asian Cup.

Established in 1913, NISS promotes the study of the social sciences, supports social science research and discussion, and presents Gold Medals to individuals who have rendered distinguished service to humanity. NISS is headquartered in New York City, and includes Florida Chapter based in Palm Beach, Florida.  Current activities  Since 1913, NISS has presented Gold Medals that celebrate the accomplishments of distinguished Americans and world leaders who have contributed at the highest level to the welfare and improvement of society. Gold Medal honorees, which include four U.S. presidents and 16 Nobel Prize winners, represent outstanding achievement in the social sciences, law, government, education, philanthropy, the arts, medicine, science, and industry. The organization sponsors annual luncheons in New York City and Palm Beach, Florida, as well as other cultural and social events. It supports a grants program that supports graduate students in the final stages of completing their dissertations and a scholarship program for college students.  Early history  The National Institute of Social Sciences traces its origins to the American Social Science Association, or ASSA, which was established in 1865 in Boston as the American Association for the Promotion of Social Science. The ASSA was chartered by an act of the 56th Congress on January 28, 1899. In 1912, the ASSA created NISS as a separate department. In 1926, when the ASSA dissolved, an act of Congress transferred its congressional charter to the NISS \\"for the furtherance of the interests of social science.\\"  Gold Medals  The NISS original constitution states the organization's goal \\"to promote the study of Social Science and to reward distinguished services rendered to humanity, either by election to the National Institute, or by the bestowal of medals or other insignia.‚Äù In 1913 the NISS bestowed its first Gold Medals in recognition of significant contributions to humanity. The first recipients were William Howard Taft, 27th President of the United States, Archer M. Huntington, founder of the Hispanic Society of America, and Samuel L. Parrish, founder of the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, NY. Each year since 1913, (except for 1922), the organization has presented Gold Medals to distinguished individuals.

The 1920 journal, for example, included articles by the noted economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen and academic Virginia Gildersleeve. In the 1970s, the National Institute supported a national project on experiential education. The project was begun in 1974 by Frank Pace, Jr., the NISS president, to strengthen field experiential education and support the NISS's \\"original mission and function.\\"  Grants and scholarships  In 2011 the Institute began awarding Seed Grants to graduate students completing dissertations in social science fields. In 2016, it was announced the Hirokazu Shirado, then a graduate student at Yale University, would receive the fourth Seed Grant through this program. NISS's Florida Chapter supports a college scholarship program for graduating seniors from the Dreyfoos School of the Arts in Palm Beach.

In 2005, she started her talk show 'Studio e Hapur' in Alsat television where she also served as Director of news department. Vasili left Alsat, rebranded later as Albanian Screen television in 2011 due to financial problems of this television that was closed later.

Many of the architects and builders of the district's homes were German as well; they generally built houses in vernacular styles using masonry.

Taxonomy Melanotaenia splendida is highly variable and although three subspecies have been recognised these have been found to show a wide variety of morphology within each subspecies. These differences are obvious in colouration and in the depth of the body. The three commonly recognised subspecies are: * Melanotaenia splendida inornata (Castelnau 1875) \\\\- chequered rainbowfish * Melanotaenia splendida splendida (Peters 1866) \\\\- eastern rainbowfish * Melanotaenia splendida tatei (Zietz 1896) \\\\- desert rainbowfish Melanotaenia splendida inornata Distribution The chequered rainbowfish is found in northern Australia from the Mary River east to the Cape York Peninsula and south to the Jardine River, it is also found on some of the Torres Strait Islands. The eastern rainbowfish occurs in rivers east of the Great Dividing Range from the Torres Strait Islands and the Cape York Peninsula south to the Dawson River in Queensland. the desert rainbowfish is endemic to the drainage basin of Lake Eyre. Habitat and biology Melanotaenia splendida are normally found close to the surface of the deeper pools in small freshwater streams, they also occur in lakes and reservoirs. These fishes are frequently recorded in large schools and these can be found in water varying from clear to turbid and which may or may not have extensicve vegetation. M. splendida is an omnivore which feeds on filamentous algae, aquatic and terrestrial insects, small crustaceans and other small invertebrates. Like other rainbowfish, this species shows sexual dimorphism. Breeding takes place year round and the male and female fish form pairs in which the females releases the eggs and the male fertilises them. 60-70 eggs are laid at each spawning and the golden coloured, round eggs attach to submerged vegetation with an adhesive filament. The larvae hatch after around a week and are around 4mm long and they have a reduced yolk sac and fully formed mouth and pectoral fins. The larvae start to feed after 24 hours.

A publisher's hand : strategic gambles and cultural leadership by Moses Dresser Phillips in antebellum America, MaryKate McMaster, Ph.D. dissertation, College of William and Mary in Virginia, 2001. , best known for creating the Atlantic Monthly. Phillips was born in Charlton, Massachusetts. At age 18 he moved to Worcester, Massachusetts, where he served as a bookstore clerk in the shop of Clarendon Harris.James Russell Lowell and His Friends, by Edward Everett Hale, Houghton Mifflin & Co., 1898, pages 154-159. In 1835 he established his own bookstore in partnership with William Lincoln, and around 1843, in partnership with Charles Sampson, he founded the Boston publishing house of Phillips & Sampson (later Phillips, Sampson & Company). Phillips told an anecdote, recounted by Hale,Hale, loc. cit. of their first orders from San Francisco during the Gold Rush year of 1849: \\"So many hundred packs of 'Highland' cards, so many of the 'True Thomas' cards, and so on till the box was nearly full, and then 'one dozen Bibles.'\\" This was seed corn, as he said. By 1852 or 1853, the orders were for \\"Four hundred Byron's Poems, four hundred Scott's Poems, one hundred Cowper's Poems\\" and so on in large shipments. In the autumn of 1857, Phillips and Sampson determined to create and publish the Atlantic Monthly. Their plan was launched in a dinner-party, as described in a letter by Phillips:Hale, op. cit. :\\"I must tell you about a little dinner-pary I gave about two weeks ago. It would be proper, perhaps, to state the origin of it was a desire to confer with my literary friends on a somewhat extensive literary project, the particulars of which I shall reserve till you come. But to the Party: My invitations included only R. W. Emerson, H. W. Longfellow, J. R. Lowell, Mr. Motley (the 'Dutch Republic' man), O. W. Holmes, Mr. Cabot, and Mr. Underwood, our literary man. Imagine your uncle as the head of such a table, with such guests. The above named were the only ones invited, and they were all present. We sat down at three P.M., and rose at eight. The time occupied was longer by about hour hours and thirty minutes than I am in the habit of consuming in that kind of occupation, but it was the richest time intellectually by all odds that I have ever had. Leaving myself and 'literary man' out of the group, I think you will agree with me that it would be difficult to duplicate that number of such conceded scholarship in the whole country besides.... Each one is known alike on both sides of the Atlantic, and is read beyond the limits of the English language.\\" At that dinner he announced his idea for a magazine:Hale, op. cit. :\\"Mr. Cabot is much wiser than I am. Dr. Holmes can write funnier verses than I can. Mr. Motley can write history better than I. Mr. Emerson is a philosopher and I am not. Mr. Lowell knows more of the old poets than I. But none of you knows the American people as well as I do.\\" The Atlantic's first issue was published in November 1857, and quickly gained fame as one of the finest magazines in the English-speaking world.

Born into an intellectual family who descended from slaves, Vlier was educated in the Netherlands and returned to Suriname to teach. Recognizing that students were being taught European history and had no knowledge of the history of their own homeland, she wrote the first textbook on the colony. The book won a silver medal at the International Colonial and Export Exhibition of 1883 and was one of the three most-used textbooks in the Surinamese education system until 1945. Early life Maria Louisa Elisabeth Vlier was born on 19 March 1828 in Paramaribo in the Dutch colony of Suriname of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to Anna Elisabeth Heuland and Nicolaas Gerrit Vlier. Along with her younger sister, Cornelia Philippina Maria Josephina (1834‚Äì1892), Vlier grew up in an intellectual family. Descended of slaves, her father served as a prosecutor and owned two coffee plantations, Morgenster and La Prevoyance which he worked with his own slave labor, before becoming police chief of Paramaribo in 1832. Between 1832 and 1848, Vlier's father became a secretary of the Particuliere West-Indische Bank and overseer of six coffee, one cotton, and six sugar plantations. Her mother was a former slave, having gained her manumission in 1816. The couple and their daughters were part of the small black professional middle class. Vlier attended the school operated by a former slave, Johanna Christina Jonas. Jonas had been educated in the Netherlands and opened a school, which had no class or racial barriers, upon gaining her own freedom. Vlier was a good student and in 1838 was recognized with an award for her scholastic achievements. In 1844, her father took her to study in the Netherlands. She had a broad knowledge of languages, which included Volap√ºk. After completing her studies, Vlier passed her teacher's examination in 1848. Career Vlier opened a girls' school and began teaching. She moved into a house on Gravenstraat, one of the most prestigious addresses in Paramaribo. Alarmed at the lack of knowledge her students had of their homeland, she began drafting the first history of the colony. In the preface of the book, probably written in 1861 1861, she stated that her motivation for writing was that school children of Suriname knew more about the history of foreigners than they did of Suriname. Though Vlier wrote about the slave trade in her textbook Beknopte geschiedenis der kolonie Suriname voor de meer gevorderde jeugd (Brief history of the Suriname colony for more advanced youth, 1863), she was cautious with the topic. She called the trade in Africans \\"illegal\\", but was aware of the negative impact on the career of Johannes Christiaan Palthe Wesenhagen, another free black who had written about slavery in 1849. Her book contains little criticism of the Netherlands and did not write about oppression of the colonized under Dutch rule. Overall the book has a positive characterization of Dutch administration and became one of the three most-used textbooks in the education system until 1945. In 1881, Vlier published a revised edition, calling it Geschiedenis van Suriname (History of Suriname), including the 1863 abolition of slavery, which had not been included in the first volume. Two years later, when the International Colonial and Export Exhibition was held at the site of the Museumplein in Amsterdam, Vlier sent a copy of her second edition textbook to be judged for the prizes in the historical documents competition. One of 42 submissions in the category, along with Wolbers history, she took the 2nd place silver medal behind Michael Th√©ophile Hubert Perelaer's gold medal for his article on military operations at Celebes in 1858 and 1860. Vlier was not in the Netherlands to personally receive her award, but she traveled to Amsterdam in 1892, where she remained for two years before returning to Suriname. Death and legacy Vlier died in Paramaribo on 8 July 1908. At the centennial of her birth in 1928, she was honored for her contributions to the historiography of Suriname, but her history of being part of the black community had been erased. She was depicted as Dutch with parents of European descent. In 2011, Vlier's life story was included in the book 1001 vrouwen in de 20ste eeuw (1001 Women in the 20th Century) by as well as in the exhibit of the same name and based upon figures in the book, hosted by the Amsterdam Museum in 2018.

Research and career  Mackay was appointed a lecturer at University College London in 2000 and promoted to Professor in 2013. He has extensively investigated the impact of pollution on Lake Baikal, as well as the Aral Sea and Okavango Delta. He has reconstructed the climate history of Lake Baikal for the past 800,000 years. Lake Baikal is the world's deepest and oldest lake, and is home to one fifth of the world's fresh water. Over 75% of the species exist nowhere else in the world. Mackay has studied the numbers of the microalgae diatoms in Lake Baikal, and showed that they have declined as the lake gets warmer. Some diatoms are more sensitive than others, which lets Mackay and colleagues look at the impact of pollution in the past. He studies the populations of diatoms by studying silicon isotopes, which form the base of the diatom food chain. Mackay believes that the water quality has deteriorated due to inadequate sewage treatment. Additionally, the nearby Baikal Paper and Pulp Mill generates sulphates, organic chlorine and hundreds of thousands of tonnes of bleached pulp, which make their way into the lake. Mackay has shown that these changes have also impacted phytoplankton and zooplankton. = Academic service = Mackay is editor-in-chief of the Royal Geographical Society journal Geo: Geography and Environment and sits on the board of Open Quaternary.

The first is the random uncertainty which is due to the noise in the process and the measurement. The second contribution is due to the systematic uncertainty which may be present in the measuring instrument. Systematic errors, if detected, can be easily compensated as they are usually constant throughout the measurement process as long as the measuring instrument and the measurement process are not changed. But it can not be accurately known while using the instrument if there is a systematic error and if there is, how much? Hence, systematic uncertainty could be considered as a contribution of a fuzzy nature. This systematic error can be approximately modeled based on our past data about the measuring instrument and the process. Statistical methods can be used to calculate the total uncertainty from both systematic and random contributions in a measurement. But, the computational complexity is very high and hence, are not desirable. L.A.Zadeh introduced the concepts of fuzzy variables and fuzzy sets. Fuzzy variables are based on the theory of possibility and hence are possibility distributions. This makes them suitable to handle any type of uncertainty, i.e., both systematic and random contributions to the total uncertainty. Random-fuzzy variable (RFV) is a type 2 fuzzy variable, defined using the mathematical possibility theory, used to represent the entire information associated to a measurement result. It has an internal possibility distribution and an external possibility distribution called membership functions. The internal distribution is the uncertainty contributions due to the systematic uncertainty and the bounds of the RFV are because of the random contributions. The external distribution gives the uncertainty bounds from all contributions. Definition Random-Fuzzy Variable A Random-fuzzy Variable (RFV) is defined as a type 2 fuzzy variable which satisfies the following conditions: * Both the internal and the external functions of the RFV can be identified. * Both the internal and the external functions are modeled as possibility distributions(pd). * Both the internal and external functions have a unitary value for possibility to the same interval of values. An RFV can be seen in the figure. The external membership function is the distribution in blue and the internal membership function is the distribution in red. Both the membership functions are possibility distributions. Both the internal and external membership functions have a unitary value of possibility only in the rectangular part of the RFV. So, all three conditions have been satisfied. If there are only systematic errors in the measurement, then the RFV simply becomes a fuzzy variable which consists of just the internal membership function. Similarly, if there is no systematic error, then the RFV becomes a fuzzy variable with just the random contributions and therefore, is just the possibility distribution of the random contributions. Construction A Random-fuzzy variable can be constructed using an Internal possibility distribution(rinternal) and a random possibility distribution(rrandom). =The random distribution(rrandom)= rrandom is the possibility distribution of the random contributions to the uncertainty. Any measurement instrument or process suffers from random error contributions due to intrinsic noise or other effects. This is completely random in nature and is a normal probability distribution when several random contributions are combined according to the Central limit theorem. But, there can also be random contributions from other probability distributions such as a uniform distribution, gamma distribution and so on. The probability distribution can be modeled from the measurement data. Then, the probability distribution can be used to model an equivalent possibility distribution using the maximally specific probability-possibility transformation. Some common probability distributions and the corresponding possibility distributions can be seen in the figures. Normal distribution in probability and possibility. Uniform distribution in probability and possibility. Triangular distribution in probability and possibility. =The internal distribution(rinternal)= rinternal is the internal distribution in the RFV which is the possibility distribution of the systematic contribution to the total uncertainty. This distribution can be built based on the information that is available about the measuring instrument and the process. The largest possible distribution is the uniform or rectangular possibility distribution. This means that every value in the specified interval is equally possible. This actually represents the state of total ignorance according to the theory of evidence which means it represents a scenario in which there is maximum lack of information. This distribution is used for the systematic error when we have absolutely no idea about the systematic error except that it belongs to a particular interval of values. This is quite common in measurements. But, in certain cases, it may be known that certain values have a higher or lower degrees of belief than certain other values. In this case, depending on the degrees of belief for the values, an appropriate possibility distribution could be constructed. =The construction of the external distribution(rexternal) and the RFV= After modeling the random and internal possibility distribution, the external membership function, rexternal, of the RFV can be constructed by using the following equation: r_{\\\\textit{external}}(x)=\\\\sup_{x^\\\\prime}T_{min}[r_{\\\\textit{random}}(x-x^\\\\prime+x^{*}), r_{\\\\textit{internal}}(x^\\\\prime)] where x^{*} is the mode of r_{\\\\textit{random}}, which is the peak in the membership function of r_{random} and Tmin is the minimum triangular norm. RFV can also be built from the internal and random distributions by considering the Œ±-cuts of the two possibility distributions(PDs). An Œ±-cut of a fuzzy variable F can be defined as F_{\\\\alpha } = \\\\\\\\{a\\\\,\\\\vert\\\\,\\\\mu _{\\\\rm F} (a) \\\\geq \\\\alpha\\\\\\\\}\\\\qquad\\\\textit{where}\\\\qquad0\\\\leq\\\\alpha\\\\leq1 So, essentially an Œ±-cut is the set of values for which the value of the membership function \\\\mu _{\\\\rm F} (a) of the fuzzy variable is greater than Œ±. So, this gives the upper and lower bounds of the fuzzy variable F for each Œ±-cut. The Œ±-cut of an RFV, however, has 4 specific bounds and is given by RFV^{\\\\alpha} = [X_{a}^{\\\\alpha}, X_{b}^{\\\\alpha}, X_{c}^{\\\\alpha}, X_{d}^{\\\\alpha}]. X_{a}^{\\\\alpha} and X_{d}^{\\\\alpha} are the lower and upper bounds respectively of the external membership function(rexternal) which is a fuzzy variable on its own. X_{b}^{\\\\alpha} and X_{c}^{\\\\alpha} are the lower and upper bounds respectively of the internal membership function(rinternal) which is a fuzzy variable on its own. To build the RFV, let us consider the Œ±-cuts of the two PDs i.e., rrandom and rinternal for the same value of Œ±. This gives the lower and upper bounds for the two Œ±-cuts. Let them be [X_{LR}^{\\\\alpha}, X_{UR}^{\\\\alpha}] and [X_{LI}^{\\\\alpha}, X_{UI}^{\\\\alpha}] for the random and internal distributions respectively. [X_{LR}^{\\\\alpha}, X_{UR}^{\\\\alpha}] can be again divided into two sub-intervals [X_{LR}^{\\\\alpha}, x^{*}] and [x^{*}, X_{UR}^{\\\\alpha}] where x^{*} is the mode of the fuzzy variable. Then, the Œ±-cut for the RFV for the same value of Œ±, RFV^{\\\\alpha} = [X_{a}^{\\\\alpha}, X_{b}^{\\\\alpha}, X_{c}^{\\\\alpha}, X_{d}^{\\\\alpha}] can be defined by X_{a}^{\\\\alpha} = X_{LI}^{\\\\alpha}-(x^{*}-X_{LR}^{\\\\alpha}) X_{b}^{\\\\alpha} = X_{LI}^{\\\\alpha} X_{c}^{\\\\alpha} = X_{UI}^{\\\\alpha} X_{d}^{\\\\alpha} = X_{UI}^{\\\\alpha}-(X_{UR}^{\\\\alpha}-x^{*}) Using the above equations, the Œ±-cuts are calculated for every value of Œ± which gives us the final plot of the RFV. A Random-Fuzzy variable is capable of giving a complete picture of the random and systematic contributions to the total uncertainty from the Œ±-cuts for any confidence level as the confidence level is nothing but 1-Œ±. An example for the construction of the corresponding external membership function(rexternal) and the RFV from a random PD and an internal PD can be seen in the following figure. Construction of an external membership function and the RFV from internal and random possibility distributions.

Personal life Bittar was born in Franca to Mam√©dio Bittar and Manife Miguel Bittar. He grew up in Cuiab√° and Jauru in the state of Mato Grosso. In his youth he was part of several militant leftist communist and socialists groups, but in his university years he joined the center-right PMDB. Bittar is married to M√°rcia Bittar, and is the father of 4 children and as of 2018 lives in Rio Branco. Before becoming a politician he worked as a farmer, and political scientist. Political career Bittar served as state deputy in the state legislature of Acre from 1995 to 1999. He was then elected to and served in the Chamber of Deputies for three consecutive terms from 1991 to 2003. From 1997 to 2003 he was the vice-leader of the Popular Socialist Party in the federal legislature. Bittar returned to the lower house for one term from 2011 to 2014, but elected not to run for re- election but instead run for governor of Acre. In the second round of the 2014 election though he narrowly lost by around 10,000 votes to eventual winner Ti√£o Viana. In 2017 after having disagreements with his then political party the PSDB, Bittar rejoined the PMDB. In the 2018 Brazilian general election Bittar was elected to the federal senate, coincidentally beating Viana who was also running for a seat in the senate. Despite his early left-wing involvement, today politically Bittar is considered strongly economically liberal and socially conservative. Ideologically Bittar identifies himself as a liberal conservative. Highly critical of the Workers' Party's handling of the economy, Bittar was a vocal supporter of limiting government spending and the 2017 Brazil labor reform. Bittar was a supporter of Jair Bolsonaro's presidential campaign, who in turn endorsed Bittar in his senate race.

Biography Alberto Giovannetti was born in Monterotondo, Rome, in 1913. In preparation for a career in the diplomatic service, he completed the course of study at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in 1940. He worked in the offices of the Section for Relations with States of the Secretariat of State and was a peritus, that is, a designated expert, at the Second Vatican Council. As a Vatican historian, he published works defending Pope Pius XII for failing to denounce the Holocaust. Writing in the official Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano in 1963, he said that \\"the enormous dimensions and monstrous cruelty [the Jews suffered] were apparent in their full sinister light only after the war. The information about these crimes that reached the Vatican was scarce and vague...and was based on revelations and news that even those who conveyed it could not guarantee.\\" Though most of his work in Rome and as a diplomat in New York was not carried out in public, he developed a reputation for skill and acuity. Late in his career Time magazine described him as \\"deceptively cherubic\\". Early in 1964, when the government of China said that the peace strategy of Pope Paul and his two predecessors was nothing more than \\"chloroforming the world\\", Giovannetti chose to accept that assessment as a compliment, writing in L'Osservatore Romano: \\"It is with surprise that we see the Chinese Communists affirm the existence of a perfect identity of intent and action in the last three Popes in the field of the fundamental problem of peace.\\" The Vatican state department notified U.N. Secretary General U Thant that Giovannetti would be its first Permanent Observer at the United Nations on 21 March 1964. Giovannetti met with Thant for the first time on 21 September. His only public role came with the visit of Pope Paul to address to United Nations General Assembly in 1965, for which he also managed behind-the-scenes negotiations, preventing the trip from taking on a political cast and allowing local Church officials a role. His duties extended to U.N. agencies as well, in this era before the Holy See had an observer in Geneva with that responsibility; he led a delegation to a United Nations Trade Conference there in April 1964. As both a priest and diplomat, Giovannetti continued to perform certain pastoral duties, officiating, for example, at the wedding of a U.N. official from Dahomey, attended by that country's president. Pope Paul appointed Giovanni Cheli to succeed Giovannetti at his U.N. position in 1973. Like Giovannetti, Cheli was not yet a bishop when appointed; the policy of giving diplomats of a certain rank the status of archbishop was established later. In retirement Giovannetti authored a spy novel that appeared in Italian as Requiem per una spia in 1978 and in an English translation as Requiem for a Spy in 1983. Its cover carried the description \\"a novel about a false priest and a true faith\\".

Plot Tousuke Rokudou, a first-year student at Amori High, a school attended mostly by delinquents, wants to live a peaceful life with his friends. However, this seems to be impossible because of the fact that he is constantly bullied by his delinquent classmates. When Rokudou and his friends become desperate, Rokudou receives a mysterious package from his long-deceased grandfather. Inside lies, a priest's uniform and a mysterious scroll passed down through his family since the Japanese Heian period, said to hold a technique that wards off demons and evil spirits. In hopes of combating his delinquent tormentors, he undergoes the ritual to activate the scroll's power. The scroll initially seems to have no effect on his school's delinquent population, but once a bully tormenting Rokudou is stopped by a delinquent girl, Rokudou's friends realize that the technique's power does not ward off evil spirits and monsters, but rather makes the user popular with bad women. After realizing the potential of his newfound ability, Rokudou vows to become stronger and use his power to achieve his dream of having a peaceful school life, unwittingly acquiring a harem of delinquent schoolgirls along the way. Characters ; : The main protagonist of the series, Tousuke Rokudou is physically weak and cowardly attending a school filled with delinquent students. He and his two friends live in constant fear and is regularly bullied, leading to the trio venting their frustrations in private in the school's restroom. Upon receiving a scroll from his grandfather, Rokudou gains a special pentagram mark on his forehead. Rokudou's ancestors used this spell to exorcise oni, but in the modern day, the spell causes any \\"bad girl\\" to instantly fall in love with him once he makes eye contact with them. His school life drastically changes as not only is he thrust into the delinquent culture of his school, but he encounters several girls, each one presenting a new problem. He helps rehabilitate most of the girls focused on, each one genuinely falling in love with Rokudou or becoming a close ally. While Rokudou refuses to fight in the beginning of the story, his tenacity and refusal to run away has garnered respect from his former bullies. Later, he learns kung- fu and has learned most of its fundamentals from Ling Lan. ; : Most likely nicknamed for military beret and camouflage in his outfit, \\"Colonel\\" is one of Rokudou's friends from the beginning of the series. He shares Rokudou's dream of living a peaceful school life, free of his delinquent bullies. Along with Rokudou and their friend \\"Manager\\", he huddles in a bathroom stall during school hours to vent his frustration with the way his life at Amori High is. He is the first to theorize that the ability Rokudou received from the scroll was that of making him popular with \\"bad girls.\\" He frequently assists with conflicts Rokudou is involved in, along with his friends. ; : Most likely nicknamed for his formal attire and businesslike demeanor, \\"Manager\\" is one of Rokudou's friends at the beginning of the series. Like \\"Colonel\\" and Rokudou, he too, wishes to lead a peaceful life at Amori High and is constantly bullied by his delinquent classmates. Like \\"Colonel\\", he notices that Rokudou is popular with \\"bad girls\\" and tags along with Rokudou and his friends when he gets into conflict with delinquent gangs. ; : Ranna Himawari is a young girl with a notorious reputation as a Sukeban wielding a Bokken, often described as a \\"monster\\" for her sheer strength and brutality. She is the first main girl to fall in love under Rokudou's spell. Generally, Ranna does not speak or express much emotion other than emotional distance unless Rokudou is around, but tolerates his friends. Around Rokudou, she is extremely bubbly and smiles. She will not hesitate to stop and protect him when he is in danger, but will respect his wishes as she did not step in between Rokudou and Iinuma's fight when he asked her to and only attacked once he asked for her help. As a child, it is revealed that Ranna was adopted by an elderly couple because someone had left her at their doorstep. To their shock, even as a baby, she had a horribly demonic visage. Growing up, Ranna was nothing short of a demon for her cruel actions, even brutally dragging a priest tied to her tricycle. Thanks to special beads from the same priest, she became more demure, but reverted once they shattered. Years later, Rokudou would receive a pair of these beads, though now they completely pacify her, causing her to deeply fear them. Her surname, Himawari, means Sunflower in Japanese. ; : Iinuma was the main bully of Rokudou and his friends, subjecting them to cruel pranks at their expense. After Rokudou awakens his powers and inadvertently affected his girlfriend, Tsubaki, he challenged him to a fight. Despite being overwhelmingly stronger than him, Rokudou refused to run and took an intense beating before he asked Ranna to intervene in the fight. Impressed by his tenacity, Iinuma befriends Rokudou and becomes one of his closest allies, eventually becoming close enough to know about his power. He is one of the strongest fighters in Amori high, only behind to Ranna and Sayuri in terms of raw strength. Iinuma has a love for both ramen and motorcycles, desiring to one day own a mobile ramen stand. He loves customizing his motorcycle, but tends to make them overly gaudy and flashy with unnecessary \\"upgrades.\\" ; : Originally one of Rokudou's many bullies, Tsubaki is Iinuma's girlfriend. After she falls under the spell of Rokudou's powers, she becomes remorseful for the way she treats him, and apologizes to him while in the bathroom. Her attention to him draws the initial ire of Iinuma, though after the two become friends, Tsubaki regularly hangs out with Rokudou and his friends. She does not react to Rokudou's power anymore. Her name comes from the Japanese word for Camellias, tsubaki. ; : With the appearance and demeanor of an elementary school, Sayuri is often mistaken as one despite being a student at Aomori High. Despite her petite appearance, Sayuri is the bancho of the school having built a reputation its strongest physical fighter. She originally targets Rokudou for his inexplicable ability to become popular with the female students of Amori High, but when she begins her attack on him, she becomes enamored with him due to his spell's power. Rokudou thus becomes her first love. Through the influence of Rokudou, she reforms and reintegrates back into school life and helps him achieve his dream of a peaceful life by means of her powerful influence over her classmates. She has since become a powerful ally of Rokudou and one of the first to jump to his aid when matters involving outside delinquents befall him or Amori. Her name, Sayuri, means Lily in Japanese. ; : Passionate about police work and motorcycles, Azami Himeno is the third major female character to become enamored with Rokudou. Initially assumed to be sweet and feminine, she loves riding motorcycles. She holds a grudge against biker gangs, who she violently beats while mounted on her motorcycle. She acts like a vigilante, warning citizens about traffic safety and taking down those she perceives to be evil delinquents on the road. She is the only one of the main girls to not attend Amori High. Her forename is a play on the Japanese word for Thistle, azami. ; : Minami is the fourth girl Rokudou rehabilitates who has the general appearance as a bat prior to meeting Rokudou. Originally a loan shark who had scammed out money from hundreds of people, her latest being Manager's parents. In a twist of fate, she meets Rokudou and falls victim to his power and begins lavishly spending her money to impress him. She also gives him advice on how to help Manager stop his parent's loan shark, ironically putting a halt to her own plans. When she discovers Rokudou's role, she becomes despondent when her allies betray her and steal her remaining money. After hearing his plight, she gifts the money to Jin. She later enrolls Amori High the next school year as a first year student. Her surname in Japanese is based on the Japanese Marigold Bush. ; : When Rokudou and his male friends attempted to search a remote mountain for a temple that supposedly had the beads that could pacify Ranna, Rokudou encountered Ling Lan who had found them while they were lost in the forest. Upon first glance, she was serene, even described as a \\"goddess\\" by Rokudou and his friends. In reality, she too was wearing the very beads Rokudou had been searching for. Upon returning to the temple, she had inadvertently removed the beads wanting to give it to Rokudou to help him, but in the process had removed its effects and becomes the fifth girl. Ling Lan is a foul mouth, brash, and fight-seeking girl and a master of kung-fu. While immune to Rokudou's spell with the beads on, upon its removal, she too fell under his spell. She teaches Rokudou the basics of kung-fu and after a week, he had grasped enough basics to become a competent fighter and she falls in love with him. After the priest decided to depart on a pilgrimage with the remaining rehabilitating teenagers, Ling Lan enrolls at Amori High school as Rokudou's underclassmen in his second year. Her name in Chinese means Lily of the Valley. ; : Adopted daughter of a female crime boss, Sachiyo has the power of foresight by looking into the eyes of another person. Her clairvoyance ranges in time, but in most instances she uses it to see into the near future. It was initially believed that she was sent to Amori High School as a new first year student by her mother to extort the student body using her power. Unbeknownst to her, her mother intentionally sent her there to meet Rokudou and use his power to reform her into a normal girl, making her the sixth girl. Upon falling to his power, she loses her foresight, becoming clumsy as a result and slightly depressed by the loss of her own power. Her mother's associates kidnap her as they need her power to maintain their hold on the criminal underworld. Her surname in Japanese, Sakura, means Cherry Blossom. =Onishima Alliance (È¨ºÂ≥∂ÈÄ£Âêà)= ; : Leader of the Onishima Alliance. Though he is polite, he can also be extremely intimidating. Like Rokudou, he was once a timid and extremely fearful of other people, resorting to bribing stronger individuals to protect him. He eventually joined the Onishima Alliance in order to be surrounded by strong individuals. After Ranna easily defeated the Alliance on her own, he fell in love with her strength and desired to have her join the alliance by gathering strong individuals to refortify its ranks, taking over as leader of the Alliance in the process. Despite being a coward in the past, he has become strong enough to fight off Rokudou and his friends all on his own. Despite failing to recruit Ranna, he soon realizes that he has become strong and his allies in the Alliance genuinely admire him for his strength and acknowledges his worth without any bribe to validate him. ; : Holding Rank 1 in the Onishima Alliance and is the strongest member of its alliance after Douji. She has an interest in strong men, but she shows her feelings through acts of sadism, reveling in breaking their spirits. Under Rokudou's power, she sees him as an exaggeratedly strong man that progressively intensifies during their fight. Rokudou \\"defeats\\" her after rescuing her from falling out a window, causing his power to exaggerate his appearance so much that she faints in bliss. In the aftermath of the fight between the Onishima Alliance and Amori High, she leaves the Onishima Alliance. Part of her surname, Yashi, means Palm Tree. ; Sumire Triplets : The Sumire Triplets are three biological triplet siblings who share the 5th rank of the Onishima Alliance, though Amano is the true 5th rank. Amano is the eldest, Kazeno is the middle, and Raino is the youngest and only girl. They are near identical in appearance and are skilled enough to use make-up to flawlessly impersonate each other. Their names contain the kanji for Sky, Rain, and Lightning respectively while their surname, Sumire, is Violet in Japanese. ; : The youngest of the Sumire Triplets and the only girl. Raino crossdresses, taking on an appearance and personality of an Ikemen and is skilled with make up. Her make-up skills are so convincing that she could effortlessly disguise Rokudou as a cute girl. She falls under Rokudou's power during the Onishima arc and acts girly around him. She genuinely falls in love with Rokudou for his kind heart and gives him his first kiss. Later she confesses her feelings to Rokudou, but he gently rejects her. She shares Rank 5 with Kazeno in the Onishima Alliance. ; : The middle child of the Sumire Triplets, Kazeno frequently crossdresses as a female and acts similarly to an idol. He is protective of his sister and is initially disturbed by Rokudou due to seeing his sister fall under his power and later when Rokudou claimed that he is a pervert to hide his power from Kazeno. Like his sister, he idolizes Amano, but desires to stand as an equal to him rather than follow in his footsteps. He assists his sister during the Onishima arc to help her fight for Rokudou. He and Raino share the Rank 5 in the Onishima Alliance. ; : The eldest of the Sumire Triplets, Amano is a secret member of the Onishima Alliance and the true 5th Rank. He is greatly admired by his two younger siblings and is the one who recruited them into the Onishima Alliance. In their youth, they would use their shared physical appearances to pull off mischief. He is the one who taught Kazeno and Raino how to fight and how to use make-up. During the battle against Amori high, Raino fights him and wins, leading him to acknowledge that his siblings are now his equals. While his two siblings leave the Alliance, Amano willingly stays. =Other Characters= ; : Aoi was a member of the Onjima Alliance, leading its motorcycle squad. He is normally warm and friendly, but can become violent and extremely competitive behind the wheel of his motorcycle. He was slowly being reformed by a motorcycle riding police officer until the officer was badly injured in an accident. He is a close associate to Himeno and raced against her and Rokudou, but lost. He left his gang behind and left Azami in charge of them. He has remained close with her, but often gets competitive around her. ; : Erika is the leader of an all girl-gang, Team Ryuugu. In the past, Team Ryuugu was a street gang who constantly got into fights with rival gangs. During a brawl, Ranna joined in and became an unofficial member, helping her team ascend to the top of the city gangs. However, once the Onishima Alliance began attacking her crew, she decided to disband it for their safety. She is the one who gave Ranna her wooden sword. Now her gang are law abiding citizens who continue to dress in their original gang style. After seeing Ranna's personality change, she tasks Rokudou to keep her happy. Her name contains the kanji for Pear tree. ; : A 42 year old female Yakuza crime boss and was indirectly involved with Minami's story as it was her who tasked Jin with targeting Manager's parent's warehouse. She is the adoptive mother of Sachiyo whom she found in Sachiyo's biological parent's apartment after they amassed a massive debt to her and abandoned Sachiyo as a result. She immediately discovered Sachiyo's power and adopted her, using her power to help grow her crime family. Overtime, Sachiko developed a motherly bond with her and desired to keep her out of the underground world. After encountering Rokudou and falling victim to his spell effects, she extensively researched his power and easily figured out its mechanics as well as his history of using the power. Wanting Sachiyo to live a normal life, she intentionally made her attend Amori High as a means to achieve this and directly enlisted Rokudou's help to achieve this goal. Rokudou accepts her request to rehabilitate her daughter, but refuses her protection should Ranna ever go on a rampage. Grateful for his kindness, Sachiko still promises to intervene with Ranna once her daughter has been reformed.

Magazinoviƒá and the U.S. consul at Bucharest, Ludwig J. Czapkay, tried to initiate U.S.-Serbian official contacts in 1867, the year when Ottoman troops withdrew from Serbia, but to no avail. In 1839 the first generation of learned Serbs born in Serbian lands (then divided between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire) was sent abroad for education on the state bursaries in order to train a 'local' bureaucratic and intellectual elite who had to substitute for the Serbs from Habsburg Vojvodina. Kosta Magazinoviƒá was among many chosen to study at the military academy in Vienna, but he arbitrarily went to Imperial Russia, then to Leipzig to study philosophy and finally to Paris where he enrolled in the law school. There he met other Serbian Parisians such as Milan Simiƒá, Konstantin Cukiƒá, Dimitrije Crnobarac, and Ljubomir Nenadoviƒá. Upon graduation, he returned to Serbia and joined the civil service.He wrote Memoari (Memoirs) where he tells the many experiences he had in his political and diplomatic career in Serbia and abroad during the 19th century. He was elected regular member of Dru≈°tvo srbske slovesnosti (Society Of Serbian Letters: the forerunner of the Serbian Royal Academy) on 1 August 1848.

Pix's first play, it purported to describe incidents in the life of Ibrahim, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. The numbering is correct only if Mehmed the Conqueror is regarded as the first emperor, and the disputed reign of his son Cem is counted as well. The play has been called a \\"proto-feminist depiction of the power-struggle between a sultan and a seraglian woman\\".  Plot  The play focuses on Emperor Ibrahim and his rape of Morena. Sheker Para (Ibrahim's mistress) seeks revenge after being rejected by Amurat. She encourages Ibrahim to seduce Morena, a young woman who is engaged to Amurat. Morena rejects Ibrahim's advances so he orders her to be dragged to a chamber, where he violently rapes her. Afterwards, a Mufti describes how terribly Morena has been treated by Ibrahim. The injured Morena takes poison and dies in Amurat's arms, but not before inspiring a revolution against Ibrahim.  Reception  The play was very successful when first performed in 1696, and was also performed several times in 1704. It was also revived in 1715.

Once billed as \\"the most beautiful man in the world,\\" Swan has come to be looked on as a \\"gay camp icon.\\" Life Paul Swan was born in Ashland, Illinois in 1883. He and his family moved to Crab Orchard, Nebraska when he was 6 years old. His mother's religious convictions were disturbed by her son's \\"strange quirks\\" such as the elaborate theater productions he made with his sisters' dolls. Of his Nebraska home, Swan said in 1917 \\"My people are very orthodox and do not believe in the life I have chosen. They believe it wrong to cultivate personal charm.\\" As a teenager, Swan moved around various cities in the Midwestern United States. He tended to be rejected for his unconventional behavior and gender nonconformity, so he cultivated friendships with artists and LGBT figures in the area, including Willa Cather. In 1906 he was able to move to New York where he got a job with Dilineator magazine drawing ladies hats. Water nymph, 1907 In 1910 Swan saw Russian actress Alla Nazimova perform in Ibsen‚Äôs play Little Eyolf in Albany, New York. He was inspired to paint her life-sized portrait and send it to her as a gift. She was so pleased that she commissioned Swan to paint four additional portraits. He used the money from the commission to travel to Egypt and Greece. In Greece he began his career as a dancer. Swan married Helen Palmer Gavit, granddaughter of sculptor Erastus Dow Palmer, in 1911 or 1912. They had two daughters. Though Swan had a number of other lovers in his life, both men and women, he stayed close with his wife until her death in 1951. The aesthetic, Greek-inspired art and dance styles that Swan learned during this time would remain little changed throughout his life. Swan would reject what he called \\"all the weird -isms\\" of \\"cubism, futurism, post-impressionism.\\" This classical style was falling out of fashion even at the time that Swan was learning it. His decades of persistence with the outdated style would lead to his eventual perception as camp. Paul Swan's portrait of Isadora Duncan, 1922 However, the eroticism of Swan's near-nude performances was shocking and innovative for the time. A journalist described the reaction of Paris audiences to shows that Swan starred in: \\"even this gay city has been shocked really and truly by the prevailing cult of nakedness, whose expositions grow more and more daring.\\" Swan described himself in 1915 as \\"the only man in the world who has the courage to take off his clothes and dance.\\" \\"What he was doing would make him liable to be in prison,\\" observed Swan biographer Richard Londraville. \\"He was able to walk through the world much more freely than most homosexuals would at the time. He was very lucky to have a wife that he could fall back on.\\" Swan become a friend and possibly lover to Isadora Duncan, pioneer of modern dance. He painted Duncan's portrait in 1922. His training as a dancer translated to a career as a silent film actor. He appeared in the 1923 film The Ten Commandments by Cecil B. DeMille, and in other films of the silent era. Swan moved to Paris in the early 1930s. Much of his artwork from this period was lost as a consequence of the Nazi occupation of Paris. His fame in the US had faded during his time overseas, but the war forced him to return. Swan took up residence at a studio in Carnegie Hall. There he performed weekly dance recitals almost every Sunday evening from 1939 to 1969. As fashions changed and Swan aged, his weekly dance performances came to be seen as campy. Andy Warhol included Swan's dance in Camp, a 1965 underground film about the camp style. Swan died in 1972 at age 88 in Bedford Hills, NY. He is buried in his family's plot in Crab Orchard. In media A play about Swan's dance recitals in later life, Paul Swan is Dead and Gone, ran in New York in 2019.

Born in Baltimore, Maryland to Wilmer Lansfield Keller and Jeanie n√©e Simonton, May Lansfield Keller received an early private school education at the Little Dames' School in the Baltimore area. From 1888 to 1894, she studied at the Girls' Latin School, then matriculated to Goucher College in 1894. She joined Pi Beta Phi, and would remain active in the sorority past her graduation in 1898. At this point she became interested in taking graduate studies in Germany, but her father was opposed so she instead enrolled at the University of Chicago in the fall of 1898. However, she didn't appreciate how women were treated at the institution. Gaining her father's consent, in 1901 she traveled to Heidelberg, Germany to study for her doctorate with financial assistance from her family and from Goucher. Both Heidelberg and Freiburg had allowed women to matriculate beginning in 1900, but nonetheless she met stiff resistance to her attendance. What she did find though was that, educationally, when she overcame the obstacles placed in her path she was treated no differently than the men in her classes. She graduated with a doctoral degree in 1950 magna cum laude with a thesis titled, The Anglo-Saxon Weapon Names ‚àí with an Archaeological Investigation of the Weapons of Attack and Defense in use among the Anglo-Saxons from the 5th century to the time of the Norman Conquest. Upon her return to the United States, a job was waiting her. From 1904‚àí06, she was head of the Department of German at Wells College in New York, becoming associate professor of English in 1906 at Goucher College. Dr. Keller became Grand President of Pi Beta Phi in 1908, and held that position until 1918. She founded the Maryland branch of the Southern Association of College Women in 1909, then served as president of the organization during 1910‚Äì1914. In 1914, Keller became dean of the newly-formed Westhampton College in Richmond, and would remain at that position for 32 years, retiring June, 1946. She was the first woman to be named dean of a Virginia college. The Pi Beta Phi foundation named the May Lansfield Keller Award for Philanthropic Leadership after her, as was the Keller Hall named at Westhampton College.

The post was named for Alexander McRae (1829‚Äì1862) a slain hero of the 1862 Battle of Valverde. The site of Fort McRae is located on the east bank of the Elephant Butte Reservoir in the general area of Elephant Butte, New Mexico within McRae Canyon.

See  History  = Union Army = Fort McRae was first established by California Volunteers of the Union Army during the American Civil War on April 3, 1863. It was located east of the Rio Grande on the south side of Canyon del Muerto, (now known as McRae Canyon), at an elevation of 4,423 feet / 1,348 meters in the southern Fra Cristobal Range, 3 miles northeast of Elephant Butte, in Sierra County, New Mexico. It was located nearby to the west of the Ojo del Muerto, a spring in the Canyon del Muerto, one of the few reliable water sources along the route of the Jornada del Muerto.Wilson, John P., Between the River and the Mountains: A History of Early Settlement in Sierra County, New Mexico, Report #40, John P. Wilson, Las Cruces, New Mexico, August 1985 Fort McRae was established to protect the area of new settlements and road on the west bank of the Rio Grande Valley and in the road across the Jornada del Muerto from Navaho and Apache raiders. It also blocked the Apache and Navajo from using the Canyon del Muerto gap through the Fra Cristobal Range and also from using the Ojo del Muerto spring. The post was originally founded by California Volunteers of the Union Army in 1863 to the protect settlements of Alamosa and Canada Alamosa, and the travelers on the Fort Craig - Fort Thorn Wagon Road and Jornada del Muerto from Apache raids. Later settlements of Plaza del Rio Palomas, in 1867 and Cuchillo Negro in 1871, were added to the Fort's protection duties. The Volunteers during their time at Ft. McRae built a cenotaph with names of soldiers in the post cemetery, that was enclosed within a stone wall.Rio Grande Republican, Dec. 22, 1880, p.1 The Volunteers manned it until they were relieved by soldiers of the regular U.S. Army during the aftermath of the American Civil War in 1866. = U. S. Army = Fort McRae was the only outpost within a radius of , except for the other U.S. Army forts; Fort Craig which was away to the north and Fort Selden which was 60 miles away to the south. In 1867, Alamocita, a small New Mexican town was established on the east bank about six miles up the Rio Grande from the fort, some from Alamosa, three miles away on the west bank that had been destroyed by the flooding earlier that same year. That year too, the Plaza del Rio Palomas, later more commonly called Las Palomas, was founded twenty miles down river from the fort on the west bank, at the confluence of Palomas Creek with the Rio Grande. The population thought it easier to defend from Apache attacks, and easier to reinforce from Fort McRae, than their former home in Canada Alamosa. Between 1868 and 1871, Cuchillo Negro was settled by pioneering New Mexican farmers from Alamosita. After a peace was made Fort McRae provided the garrison at the Apache reservation at Ojo Caliente on the upper Ca√±ada Alamosa. In October 1876, the fort was decommissioned and abandoned, the garrison withdrawn and their responsibilities taken over by Fort Craig. The Site Today The site today, partially submerged at times of high water in the reservoir, in recent years has been exposed by the lower water. It has some foundations and other traces of the fort on the south side of McRae Canyon.

It was discovered by Heinrich d'Arrest on September 26, 1865. It is classified as a Seyfert galaxy.  Characteristics  The nucleus of NGC 931 has been found to be active and it has been categorised as a type I Seyfert galaxy due to its narrow H-beta emission line. The most accepted theory for the energy source of active galactic nuclei is the presence of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. The mass of the black hole in the centre of NGC 931 is estimated to be 107.64 ¬± 0.40 (17- 110 million) based on the stellar velocity dispersion. NGC 931 has been found to emit radiowaves, ultraviolet and X-rays. Observations by ASCA revealed the X-ray spectrum was composed of soft and hard emission. The hard element was identified as a strong and wide fluorescent FeKa line, which is created when X-rays meet an optically cold thick material. The soft element has been identified as warm absorbing material. The galaxy was further observed by XMM-Newton, where it was observed that there were significant fluctuations and time lags in the flux changes observed both in the soft and hard elements. A detail X-ray spectrum of NGC 931 was obtained by Chandra X-ray Observatory. It revealed the presence of many absorption lines from neon, magnesium, and silicon, with a variety of ionisation states. These lines were attributed to low ionisation gases surrounding the nuclear X-ray source. No significant outflowing gas was detected in the large scale.  Supernova  One supernova has been observed in NGC 931, SN 2009lw. The supernova was discovered by W. Li, S. B. Cenko, and A. V. Filippenko during the Lick Observatory Supernova Search on 24.24 November 2009, when it had an apparent magnitude of 18.8. It was identified as a type-Ib or possibly a type-IIb supernova a few months past maximum light.  Nearby galaxies  NGC 931 has been identified as a member of the NGC 973 group, one of the largest galaxy groups of the Perseus-Pisces Supercluster, with at least 39 galaxies identified as its members. Other members of the group include NGC 917, NGC 940, NGC 969, NGC 973, NGC 974, NGC 978, NGC 987, NGC 983, NGC 1060, NGC 1066, NGC 1067, and UGC 2105. On the other hand, Garcia recognised NGC 931 as the largest galaxy in a galaxy group known as the NGC 931 group, which also included NGC 940. A smaller companion galaxy, measuring 0.2 by 0.1 arcminutes, is superimposed on the galaxy, lying about 0.35 arcminutes towards the north.Nilson, P.

Gierach is an American epidemiologist and women's health researcher. She is the Deputy Chief of the Integrative Tumor Epidemiology Branch in the National Cancer Institute.  Education  Gierach completed a B.S. from Pennsylvania State University in 1998. She earned a M.P.H. (2004) and Ph.D. (2006) in epidemiology from University of Pittsburgh with a focus in cancer epidemiology and women‚Äôs health. Her master's thesis was titled Gender of Offspring and Maternal Ovarian Cancer Risk. Gierach's doctoral advisor was Francesmary Modugno. Her dissertation was titled Inflammation and Breast Cancer Risk. Gierach acknowledge the support of Jane A. Cauley, Joel L. Weissfeld, John W. Wilson, Victor G. Vogel III, Jennifer K. Simpson, and Roberta B. Ness. Gierach also credited the support from her colleagues, Phyllis Kernoff Mansfield, Patricia Barthalow Koch, Susannah Heyer Barsom, and Ann Voda.  Career  Gierach joined the National Cancer Institute Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) as a NCI Cancer Prevention Fellow in 2006. As a fellow, HREB Branch Chief Louise A. Brinton, offered Gierach the opportunity to develop and oversee a new project known as the Breast Radiology Evaluation and Study of Tissues (BREAST), which is funded by proceeds from the sale of the U.S. Postal Service Breast Cancer Research Stamp. The study, which Gierach co-leads with Mark E. Sherman, a senior clinician in HREB, considers both the radiologic features of the breast through mammography and the histologic, molecular, and biochemical characteristics of breast tissue among women undergoing image-guided breast biopsies at the University of Vermont Breast Cancer Surveillance System site. Gierach is relating indices of mammographic density to tissue-level biomarkers that may uncover the mechanisms linking high mammographic density to breast cancer risk. Gierach became a tenure-track investigator in 2010, was awarded tenure in 2017, and became Deputy Chief of the Integrative Tumor Epidemiology Branch in 2018. Gierach serves as chair of the Division‚Äôs Breast Cancer Working Group and co- chair of the DCEG Hormone Laboratory Advisory Committee. = Research = Gierach studies of the etiology of hormonally-related female cancers, particularly in the molecular mechanisms underlying breast carcinogenesis. Her interdisciplinary research program has a special emphasis on the molecular epidemiology of mammographic density, one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer. Gierach's lab is conducting several investigations designed to address the role of genes in mammographic density. In collaboration with DCEG‚Äôs Clinical Genetics Branch, they are examining whether mammographic density and computer-extracted mammographic texture pattern features differ by BRCA1/2 mutation status. In addition to addressing how molecular epidemiologic factors may influence mammographic density and its associated breast cancer risk, Gierach is addressing other ways in which density may relate to breast carcinogenesis. In light of emerging evidence indicating that reductions in mammographic density may predict response to tamoxifen treatment, Gierach and her colleagues initiated a study within Kaiser Permanente Northwest to determine whether breast cancer patients who experience large reductions in density following tamoxifen treatment have an improved prognosis. We have also launched the Ultrasound Study of Tamoxifen, in which we are using novel ultrasound tomography methods to assess changes in volumetric breast density within the first year of tamoxifen therapy. These studies may provide support for future investigations evaluating change in mammographic density as a ‚Äúbiosensor‚Äù of factors that increase or decrease breast cancer risk.  Awards and honors  Gierach has been awarded the DCEG Molecular Epidemiology Research Funding Award, the NCI Merit Award in Cancer Prevention Research Training, and an Award to Advance Research on Cancers in Women from the NCI Office of Science Planning and Assessment and the NIH Office of Research on Women‚Äôs Health.

It was produced in the mid-1960s. The film was digitally preserved in 2009 by the UCLA Film and Television Archive as part of the Outfest Legacy Project for LGBT Film Preservation. Andrea James and Jenni Olson were among those who worked on its restoration. Synopsis and cast Four trans women from New York City are interviewed in what is professed to be part of a six- month psychological project. They are introduced as \\"contestants in a recent beauty contest\\". The four of them answer questions about their lives as trans women. They discuss having to present as male during the day at their jobs, undergoing hormone therapy, their dating lives, and their childhood. They also discuss the draft for the Vietnam War. In addition to the interviews, the film contains footage documenting a drag ball. The four women give their names as Misty, Vicky, Sonja, and Simone. Full names are not used, since the interviewer notes the four of them are breaking a law against cross-dressing. Misty works as a bank teller, Vicky works as a cosmetician, Sonja is a hairdresser, and Simone works on window displays. The interviews are conducted by Jay Martin. Production and release The film was anonymously made, and its production date is also unknown. The Southeastern Pictures Corporation initially released Queens at Heart alongside the 1967 film She-Man. Queens at Heart has subsequently been dated to around 1965 or 1967. In the mid-1990s, Jenni Olson rediscovered the film after buying a 35 mm reel from a Kansas City projectionist for $75. Only a few prints of Queens at Heart existed, and the original negative has been lost. The film was digitally restored from two prints whose color had faded. The restoration was done by the UCLA Film and Television Archive for the Outfest Legacy Project for LGBT Film Preservation; it was completed in 2009. The film was the first to be deposited into the project's archive. Funding for the film's restoration was provided by Joanne Herman, as well as the Andrew J. Kuehn, Jr. Foundation and Outfest; Andrea James, Tom Letness, Dick Millais, Jenni Olson, and Kristin Pepe were also involved in the restoration. The restored film screened at Outfest in 2010. Queens at Heart was screened at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 2012 alongside two other films about early LGBT life: Mona's Candle Light (1950) and Choosing Children (1984).

The film also appears on the video streaming platform Kanopy within the United States; it was added to its collection in 2016. Queens at Heart is a bonus feature on Kino Lorber's 2020 Blu-ray for The Queen. Critical response In the 21st century, it has been variously described as a trans exploitation film, a short documentary film, and an \\"exploitation documentary short\\". However, critics have also noted it provides a candid look at the life of some transgender women in the time before the Stonewall riots. J. Hoberman for The New York Times called it \\"at once an exploitation film and an educational one, with a tone variously prurient, dismissive, and nonjudgemental\\". Sarah Fonseca for them. called it \\"a red-blooded American exploitation film that tries to pass itself off as an expert documentary\\" and criticized the interviewer but also said the four women's participation \\"has enormous value for those interested in queer and trans life before Stonewall.\\" Olson has described this as \\"the most important film\\" that she found. The film is included among the Staff Picks on Kanopy.

New Jersey map of K√∂ppen climate classification. Temperature \\"The statewide average temperature in 2012,\\" , \\"was the highest in 118 years of records.\\" This was above the 1981-2010 mean. As of 2013, \\"[n]ine of the ten warmest calendar years on record have occurred since 1990 and the five warmest years have occurred since 1998, consistent with the long-term upward trend of per century.\\" Precipitation According to the EPA, as of 2016, \\"[a]verage annual precipitation in New Jersey has increased 5 to 10 percent in the last century, and precipitation from extremely heavy storms has increased 70 percent in the Northeast since 1958.\\" Similarly, according to a 2013 Rutgers Climate Institute study, \\"[s]ince 1895, annual precipitation has increased at a rate of (or about 9%) per century.\\" As of 2013, 2011 was the wettest year on record. Heavy precipitation events have been increasing in New Jersey, as is also the case \\"throughout the northeastern United States.\\" Ecosystems Many coastal species are already changing their distributions. If the sea level rises along the coast of New Jersey, \\"[w]etlands along Delaware Bay in Cumberland County\\" are \\"likely to be lost\\" due to such rise. Many species rely on tidal marshes which would be threatened as marshes erode. Such species include blue crab, perch, weakfish, flounder, and rockfish (which \\"rely on the tidal marshes in Delaware Bay to hide from predators\\"), as well as sea turtles and shorebirds (which feed on species that inhabit the marshes). \\"In Barnegat Bay and Little Egg Harbor, the rising sea is already eroding and submerging small marsh islands, which are important nesting areas that protect common terns, black skimmers, and oystercatchers from land-based predators.\\" \\"Changing temperatures could also disrupt ecosystems. For example, if water temperatures exceed during summer, eelgrass could be lost, which would remove a key source of food for many fish.\\" Higher acidity in the water also threatens certain species, like scallops and surf clams; this could lower their populations, threatening New Jersey's commercial fishing industry. \\"Water temperature data from the late 1980s to early 2000s, collected at Rutgers University Marine Field Station, demonstrate milder winter temperatures in recent years while in this same period larvae of multiple fish species of southern origin became more abundant and those of northern species declined in richness and abundance.\\" Coastline =Sea level rise= \\"At Atlantic City, where records extend back to 1912, sea level has risen by an average rate of 1.5 inches per decade over the period of record.\\" The sea level along the Jersey coast is rising faster than the global average, where the global average, since the early 1990s, has risen per decade. \\"Sea level is rising more rapidly along the New Jersey shore than in most coastal areas because the land is sinking. If the oceans and atmosphere continue to warm, the sea is likely to rise to along the New Jersey shore in the next century.\\" The sinking of New Jersey results from the fact that \\"[i]ce sheets that covered New Jersey during that last Ice Age pushed the Earth's crust down into the mantle below and that sinking continues today.\\" (See Post-glacial rebound) Rutgers scientist project that by 2030, \\"sea level is projected to rise by , with a best estimate of . In 2050, the range is with a best estimate of , and by 2100 the range is with a best estimate of .\\" \\"The United States Geological Survey estimates that barrier islands of the New Jersey shore from Bay Head to Cape May would be broken up by new inlets or lost to erosion if sea level rises by the year 2100, unless people take actions to reduce erosion.\\" =Storms= As sea level rises, potential storm surge rises as well, threatening coastal homes and infrastructure. \\"Wind speeds and rainfall intensity during hurricanes and tropical storms are likely to increase as the climate warms. Rising sea level is likely to increase flood insurance rates, while more frequent storms could increase the deductible for wind damage in homeowner insurance policies.\\" Hurricane Sandy, which struck New Jersey in 2012, was made particularly dangerous because of the storm surge it caused. \\"Recent studies find little evidence of an increase in the number of hurricanes and tropical storms in the North atlantic during the past century, but there is evidence of an increase in the frequency and intensity of intense tropical cyclones during the period since 1970.\\" \\"A recent NOAA study projects that the return period for coastal inundation equivalent to that from Sandy would decrease to less than 20 years by the end of the century if sea level rise in New Jersey is at the high end of the expected range.\\" A March 2019 report prepared by the United States Army Corps of Engineers \\"says coastal communities face a combined average of nearly $1.6 billion a year in damage in the future [from flooding, storms] if steps aren‚Äôt taken.\\" Effects on human health \\"Heat-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits in the summer have been rising over the past decade in New Jersey\\" as of 2017. Responses to climate change in New Jersey =Government= The New Jersey Global Warming Response Act of 2007 sets targets for New Jersey to reduce greenhouse gas emissions: a reduction to 1990 levels by 2020, and a reduction of 80 percent from 2006 levels by 2050. In December 2019, New Jersey joined consideration for a multi-state gasoline cap-and-trade program. The plan aims to reduce transportation-related tailpipe emissions, and would levy a tax on fuel companies based on carbon dioxide emissions. The most ambitious version of the plan is projected to reduce the area's tailpipe emissions by 25% between 2022 and 2032. The program is in the public comment phase, with individual states determining whether to participate. The program could begin as early as 2022. =University= In 2011, the New Jersey Climate Change Alliance was formed at Rutgers University. The organization \\"is a collective of organizations and individuals that share the goal of advancing science- informed climate change strategies and policy at the state and local levels in New Jersey.\\" \\"The Alliance is facilitated by Rutgers University through the Rutgers Climate Institute and the Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy.\\" The Rutgers Climate Institute at Rutgers University states that it \\"is a University-wide effort to address one of the most important issues of our time through research, education and outreach.\\" The Institute facilitates collaboration across different academic departments and focuses on outreach.

She is a journal editor, award recipient, and has written numerous articles in influential journals in her field.  Biography  Professor Zhang obtained her PhD in Health Policy (economics concentration) at Harvard University in 2007 and MS in Health Policy & Management also from Harvard University. She received her BA from Renmin University of China. Professor Yuting Zhang is currently a Professor of Health Economics at the Melbourne Institute: Applied Economic & Social Research within the Faculty of Business and Economics at the University of Melbourne. Before that, she was a tenured professor at the University of Pittsburgh. She was the founding director of the Pharmaceutical Economics Research Group since 2010. Her expertise is with using advanced econometrics and statistical methods and large data sets to design rigorous observational studies to study causal relationship between health policy/interventions and outcomes including patient health, healthcare spending, and quality of care. These empirical studies are motivated by two overarching goals: first, to design studies to identify causal relationships between health policy/interventions and health outcomes rather than mere correlations; second, to provide guidance on how health policies can be designed to achieve efficiency and high quality of care in the healthcare system. Her research areas include pharmaceutical policy and economics, mental health policy, value-based healthcare design, comparative effectiveness analysis, health insurance markets, the effect of healthcare reforms on healthcare spending and quality of care, and international health.

The General Assembly was directly elected, albeit on a restricted franchise. Its legislative power was subject to veto by the appointed Governor.  History  = Establishment = Upon assuming the duties of the governor's office in July, 1819, Territorial Secretary Robert Crittenden issued a proclamation calling a session of the territorial legislature at Arkansas Post for July 28, 1819. The only other act of any real importance performed by him during the nearly six months that he was acting governor, before Governor James Miller arrived, was the calling of a general election for November 20, 1819. At this first election five members of a legislative council one from each of the five organized counties and nine members of a house of representatives were elected, besides a territorial delegate to Congress. In authorizing the selection by popular vote of the members of a legislative council, Crittenden overreached his authority. The law which prescribed the mode of government for the Territory, as then constituted, plainly provided that the people should elect by popular choice a house of representatives; the members of this house should then meet, at such time as the governor should appoint, select the names of eighteen persons whom they deemed qualified for the office of councilmen and forward the whole list of those so nominated to the President of the United States. Upon receiving such a list of nominations, it was the duty of the President to appoint nine of the same to be members of the council. Whether Crittenden's error was due to ignorance or imprudence is uncertain. But, at all events, owing to the good sense and prudent statesmanship of Governor Miller, Congress was induced to pass a special Act, which the President approved April 21, 1820, making the election of the councilmen, in the manner authorized by Crittenden, legal after the fact in April after the election in November. Thus Arkansas was raised from a Territory of the first grade one with a legislative council whose members were to be appointed by the President to a Territory of the second grade, in which members of both branches of the territorial legislature were elected by the people themselves. = 1st General Assembly = On December 29, 1819, Governor Miller issued his proclamation calling a special session of the General Assembly for the first Monday in February, 1820, to meet at Arkansas Post. Accordingly, the first legislature elected by the people convened February 7, 1820. The council organized by electing Edward McDonald president, and Richard Chamberlain clerk. William Stevenson was chosen speaker of the house and Jason Chamberlain, clerk. Stevenson resigned the day after his election and Joseph Hardin was elected to fill the vacancy. The two houses continued in session until February 24, when they adjourned to meet again on the first Monday in October, which was October 2. This adjourned session lasted until October 25, 1820. At the adjourned session in October, the most notable Act passed was that removing the seat of government to Little Rock, the Act to take effect June 1, 1821. = 2nd General Assembly = Members of the second General Assembly were elected August 6, 1821. They met in regular session October 1, 1821, at Little Rock. Sam C. Roane was elected president of the legislative council ; Richard Searcy, secretary. William Trimble was elected speaker of the house of representatives ; Ambrose H. Sevier, clerk. The laws passed were, for the most part, measures of local character. The most important Act of the session, perhaps, was that changing the manner of voting at general elections from ballot to Viva voce. On account of the absences of Governor Miller, who had gone to New Hampshire on business, Robert Crittenden was acting governor during the session, which adjourned October 24, 1821. = 3rd General Assembly = Members of the third General Assembly were elected August 4, 1823. They met in regular session October 6, 1823. Sam C. Roane was elected president of the legislative council; Thomas W. Newton, secretary; Terence Farrelly was speaker of the house of representatives; David E. McKinney, clerk. The session lasted until October 31, 1823. = 4th General Assembly = Members of the fourth General Assembly were elected August 1, 1825. They met in regular session October 3, 1825. The session lasted until November 3, following. Jacob Barkman was elected president of the legislative council; Thomas W. Newton, secretary. Hobart Bean was speaker of the house; David Barber, clerk. = 5th General Assembly = Members of the fifth General Assembly were elected August 6, 1827. They met in regular session, October 1, 1827. Daniel T. Witter was elected president of the council; Thomas W. Newton, secretary. Ambrose H. Sevier was speaker of the house; Andrew Roans, clerk. The session adjourned October 31, 1827. The fifth General Assembly held a special session from October 6 until October 22, 1828. At this session, Sevier, who had been elected delegate to Congress in December, 1827, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Henry W. Conway, was succeeded by Edwin T. Clark, as president of the legislative council. Daniel T. Witter, who had been speaker of the house during regular session, and who had resigned his seat in the house, was succeeded by John Wilson as speaker. = 6th General Assembly = Members of the sixth General Assembly were elected August 3, 1829. The members met in regular session October 5, 1829. Charles Caldwell was elected president of the council; John Caldwell, secretary. John Wilson was speaker of the house; Daniel Ringo, clerk. The session lasted until November 21, 1829. = 7th General Assembly = Members of the seventh General Assembly were elected August 1, 1831. They met in regular session October 3, 1833. Charles Caldwell was elected president of the council; Absalom Fowler, secretary. William Trimble was speaker of the house; G. W. Ferebee, clerk. The session lasted until November 7, 1831. = 8th General Assembly = Members of the eighth General Assembly were elected August 5, 1833. They met in regular session October 7, 1833. John Williamson was elected president of the council; William F. Youmans, secretary. John Wilson was speaker of the house; James B. Keatts, clerk. The session lasted until November 7, 1833. = 9th General Assembly = Members of the ninth and last General Assembly of the Territory were elected August 3, 1835. They met in regular session October 5, 1835. Charles Caldwell was elected president of the council; S. T. Sanders, secretary. John Wilson was speaker of the house; L. B. Tully, clerk. The session lasted from October 5 until November 16, 1835. The only really important Act passed during this session was the Act which provided for the election of delegates to, and the holding of, a convention for the purpose of framing a state constitution. Accordingly, the first steps were taken in the process which won Arkansas admission into the Union.

The author, who identified himself as Jean-Baptiste Simonini of Florence, Italy claimed to have infiltrated the Piedmont Jewish community by claiming to have been a baptized Jew who wanted to restore his connection with his ancestral \\"nation\\". The Jews revealed to him that both the Freemasons and the Illuminati were founded by them and that they were planning on taking over Europe.

He is a five-time Brunei FA Cup winner and a member of ABDB's championship squad on two occasions. Club career Suhandi started playing for the football team of his employers the Brunei army in 2008. He won the majority of his FA Cup medals in his early years while competing the goalkeeper spot with Tarmizi Johari, but they were luckless in the league that was dominated by QAF FC and later Indera SC. On 1 February 2013, Suhandi scored a penalty in the 82nd minute in the 2012-13 Brunei Super League game against Najip FC which finished 11‚Äì1 to MS ABDB. This made Suhandi the third goalkeeper to score a goal in a league fixture in Brunei, after Fakhrul Zulhazmi Yussof and Mu'izzuddin Ismail. MS ABDB started the 2014 Brunei Super League with a 3-2 loss to LLRC FT on 2 February. Days later Tarmizi Johari, who had started the game, signed a professional contract with DPMM FC, enabling Suhandi to become the starting goalkeeper for the Armymen. In his third league match, he let in a free kick by Syarafuddin Hamdi Talip slip between his legs in a 0‚Äì1 reverse at the hands of MS PDB. These two defeats along with another loss to eventual champions Indera SC a month later would cost ABDB the title with Suhandi only keeping five clean sheets in 15 appearances. (Another clean sheet was attributed to Zulfadhli Matassan as Suhandi served a suspension for a red card against Majra FC.) At the start of the 2015 season Suhandi found himself replacing Tarmizi as the third-choice keeper behind Wardun Yussof and Azman Ilham Noor in the DPMM ranks. This turned into an uneventful stint for Suhandi, failing to make a single appearance even on the bench, while back at ABDB Tarmizi managed to finally win the league with only four points dropped in the 2015 Brunei Super League. Suhandi was released from DPMM in early 2016 along with Amalul Said. Suhandi returned to the MS ABDB ranks in late 2016, but by that time there were already three keepers in the squad along with the signing of former youth international Burhanuddin Edy Asmady earlier in the year. Nevertheless, he managed to appear in four matches for the 2017‚Äì18 season (another title- winning season for MS ABDB) before being deregistered soon after. International career Suhandi made his international debut for the Brunei national team as a substitute on 26 September 2012 against Indonesia national football team in a 5‚Äì0 loss, playing the last 15 minutes of the game. He was listed by the Wasps for the 2012 AFF Championship qualification matches in the following month, but did not make the cut.

Skj√∏nberg started his career in the banking industry in Krager√∏ and Skien, but in his twenties he was discovered in the amateur theater by a dance teacher, who recommended him to Alma Fahlstr√∏m in 1913. Fahlstr√∏m referred him to Sophie Reimers for training, as well as for singing lessons with Maja Flagstad. Then he received a job at the Stavanger Permanent Theater (Stavanger faste scene) with Thora Hansson, and he made his debut as Johan T√∏nnessen in Henrik Ibsen's The Pillars of Society. He remained there until 1920. He was then engaged with the National Theater from 1920 to 1924 before he went to Chat Noir to work under Victor Bernau, where he remained until 1929. After this he joined the newly opened Oslo New Theater, where he worked from 1929 to 1962, except for his years at the Tr√∏ndelag Theater, from 1937 to 1946. Skj√∏nberg participated in a number of recordings for NRK's Radio Theater, and among other things can be heard in the series about Dickie Dick Dickens and Ibsen pieces such as The League of Youth. He was also a sought-after film actor and appeared in nearly 30 films in Norway and Sweden. Among the best known are Fant (1937), the banned film To mistenkelige personer (1950), and Vi gifter oss (1951). Skj√∏nberg received the King's Medal of Merit in gold in 1959.

Personal life Donovan was born on March 15, 1864 in Boston's West End. He graduated from The English High School. Donovan's father died when he was very young and he began working at a young age. He worked for Brown, Durrell & Co., a dry goods merchant, for many years, starting as an entry clerk and finishing as an accountant. In 1891, Donovan married Marjorie McGivney. The couple moved to Allston shortly after their marriage. They had three sons and two daughters. Political career Once he reached voting age, Donovan became involved in politics in Ward 8. He was the right-hand man of Martin Lomasney, who saw Donovan as his second brother. In 1885, Donovan was a founding member of The Hendricks Club and served as its first president, although Lomasney held the actual power. Donovan was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1887 to 1888 and represented the 3rd Suffolk district in the Massachusetts Senate from 1889 to 1890. He was the youngest member both of the House and Senate during his tenure there and at the age of 24 was the youngest man ever elected to the Massachusetts Senate. In 1891, Donovan was a candidate for Boston city clerk, but the common council selected J. Mitchel Galvin instead. In 1892 he was appointed to the Boston Health Board by Mayor Nathan Matthews Jr. On January 29, 1894, President Grover Cleveland nominated Donovan for the position of Collector of Internal Revenue for the district of Massachusetts. He was confirmed on March 15, 1894 - his 30th birthday. He did not take office right away as he had been recovering from appendicitis. Donovan was an opponent of civil service reform, stating that it caused an \\"imminent danger\\" of creating \\"a great officeholding class that will take on the character of an arrogant bureaucracy\\". He fired all of the Republican employees in revenue office, including a number of Civil War veterans. On January 28, 1897, Donovan announced that he would be resigning effective February 15. It was believed that the incoming William McKinley administration would demand his resignation once it came to power. After leaving office, Donovan managed Star Brewery for a short before going into the real estate and insurance business. In 1899, Donovan returned to politics as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. On January 18, 1900, the Boston common council elected Donovan city clerk. He was selected on the first ballot with 45 of 68 votes. He was supported by both Republican and anti-machine Democratic council members. The board of aldermen instead voted for Republican Frank J. O'Toole and the two sides remained deadlocked until February 12, when the board of aldermen capitulated and voted to appoint Donovan. He took office on February 15, 1900 and resigned his seat in the state legislature the same day. Following Mayor Patrick Collins' death in 1905, Donovan entered the mayoral race as the candidate of the Hendricks Club. He officially declared his candidacy on October 16, 1905. He was opposed for the Democratic nomination by Congressman John F. Fitzgerald. Donovan was seen as the \\"machine candidate\\" as he had the support of Boston Democratic city committee president W. T. A. Fitzgerald and the majority of ward chairmen. He also had the endorsement of Acting Mayor Daniel A. Whelton. The New York Times described the race between Donovan and Fitzgerald as \\"the most bitter ever conducted in Boston\\" and described party leaders as \\"almost evenly divided in their preferences\\". Fitzgerald defeated Donovan 54% to 46%. In October 1907, Donovan fell ill with bronchitis. Although he recovered his heart was severely weakened. On January 5, 1908, Donovan died from \\"valvular disease of the heart\\".

In July 1805, Mattio, on his second self-crucifixion attempt at public streets, was successful, an act that landed him on hospital. He died the following year at the San Servolo Island asylum. Background Mattio Lovat was born in Casale, at the territory of Belluno, in 1761, in Italy. A son of poor parents, he was a shoemaker. On November 13, 1802 he went to Venice, where a younger brother named Angelo conducted Mattio to the house of a widow, the relict of Andrew Osgualda, with whom he lodged, until September 21, 1803. On the mentioned day, he made an attempt to crucify himself, in the middle of the street called Cross of Biri. Self-crucifixion attempt of 1803 In the middle of the street called Cross of Biri, Mattio made an attempt of self-crucifixion. Upon a frame that he had constructed of the timber of his bed, he was prevented from succeeding his attempt by several people who came upon him as he was driving a nail into his left foot. Being interrogated as to the motive for his self-crucifixion, he was silent, except that he once said to his brother, that that day was the festival of St. Matthew and that he could give no further explanation. Days after the affair, he set out for his own country, where he remained a certain time, but afterwards returned to Venice, and in July 1805, lodged in a room in the third floor of a house, in the street Delle Monache. Self-crucifixion attempt of 1805 On July 19, 1805 Mattio attempted to crucify himself in a public street. He constructed a wooden cross, inflicted a wound on his side, and put a crown of thorns on his head. In order to reenact the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, he then fixed himself to the cross with nails. Using a net that tied his body to the wooden beam, he finally hung himself and the cross out of the window of his room. With his left arm nailed to the cross, and his right hanging down, Lovat was found alive in the early morning by some passer-by who took him down from the cross and put him to bed. Aftermath Venetian physician Cesare Ruggieri, came to the spot out of curiosity and made sure that Lovat was immediately admitted to the Clinical School of Venice at which he himself was Professor of Surgery. For several weeks Ruggieri treated and observed Lovat at his bedside until he had physically recovered. Due to Ruggieri's diagnosis of a persistent mental disorder, Lovat was then transferred to the asylum of San Servolo, an early mental asylum situated on an island of the same name in the Venetian lagoon, where Lovat died in April 1806 from some unspecified chest disease. The case was closed. Soon, however, Ruggieri wrote down the medical case history of his patient. In his case narrative, titled in Italian Storia della crocifissione di Mattio Lovat da se stesso eseguita Ruggieri suggested that Lovat suffered from an kind of mental disorder that was connected to religion. Ruggieri subsequently published, between 1806 and 1814, the illustrated case report in two Italian versions and one in French. Subsequently, the narrative of Lovat's self-crucifixion was read, commented on, rewritten and reproduced by editors and authors in Italy, France, Germany and Britain throughout the nineteenth century. A book about Lovat's self-crucifixion, The Man Who Crucified Himself: Readings of a Medical Case in Nineteenth-Century Europe was published in November 2018. The book published in 1814 by the physician Cesar Ruggieri, tells the story of his crucified patient. A case report about Lovat's self-crucifixion is available.

The series aired from July 8 to September 23, 2020. Synopsis =Setting= In the latter part of the 2400s, air pollution reached lethal levels. As humanity hurtled toward extinction, they were also threatened by the emergence of life forms known as Gadoll causing the destruction of 90% of the world's population. Large corporations developed cyborgs to carry out human functions, but the cyborgs eventually began to outnumber humans and the Solid Quake corporation acquired rights to manage humanity. The company created a giant dome on the Eurasian continent in which they installed a colossal entertainment facility called Deca-dence, with its own independent all- governing system to make all decisions. The cyborg citizens could then safely experience adventure as human avatars at Deca-dence without the risk of real injury. =Plot= In the fortress city of Deca-dence, the lowly Tanker girl, Natsume, dreams of becoming a Gear warrior following her father's death during a Gadoll attack. She is assigned to a maintenance team led by Kaburagi whom she discovers is more than he appears. Kaburagi has a secret role in eliminating \\"bugs\\", humans who threaten Solid Quake's operations. When Kaburagi discovers that Natsume is listed as dead in the company database, he decides to keep her under observation and offers to train her to fight.

He was once a great warrior but lost the ardor to fight and spends his days supervising a team on maintenance duties.

He was previously one of Kaburagi's colleagues when he was a warrior. Thanks to his cruel personality, he likes to pick on the weak. ; : :One of Kaburagi's colleagues when he was a warrior. ; :A place deep below Deca-dence where bugs are sent instead of being scrapped for insubordination. Their de facto leader is a Donatello, and other inmates include Jill, Turkey, and Sarkozy. ; :Beasts which often attack Deca-dence and have been given names such as: octhulhu, avispine, seldurum, spoonwormer, nemollis, burrn, darumoss, megaloain and the gigantic giland. Both the fortress city Deca-dence and the cyborg society under the control of the Solid Quake corporation utilize the liquid oxyone which flows through the Gadoll's veins as their power source. Production Deca-Dence was first announced on July 5, 2019 by Kadokawa, and is the first original anime work of NUT, known for producing the anime adaptation of The Saga of Tanya the Evil. It was directed by Yuzuru Tachikawa, written by Hiroshi Seko, featuring original character designs by Pomodorosa, animation character designs and chief animation direction by Shinichi Kurita, and music composed by Masahiro Tokuda. The Deca-dence fortress was designed by Zhou Haosong, the cyborgs were designed by Kiyotaka Oshiyama, and the Gadolls were designed by Satoshi Mats≈´ra. The series is described as being a mash-up between Mortal Engines and Attack on Titan. Director Yuzuru Tachikawa and chief producer Takuya Tsunoki, who had joined Madhouse around the same time and collaborated on the 2015 series Death Parade, had talked about creating their own original work. After the establishment of NUT in 2017, the idea of creating an original work was spurred within the company, and Tsunoki and chief producer Sh≈ç Tanaka, who collaborated on NUT's adaptation of The Saga of Tanya the Evil, had talked about \\"doing something\\" together. As a result, Tachikawa, Tsunoki, and Tanaka initiated the project. Writer Hiroshi Seko, who had previously worked with Tachikawa on Mob Psycho 100, was eventually added to the project after some foundations had been built and, together, the four created the series' original concepts. Tachikawa prioritized developing the script for the dramatic beats that he wanted to depict because developing the setting and characters for an original work could take a long time. Having been written in its entirety based on the story concept created by Tachikawa, Tsunoki, Tanaka, and Seko, the script had to be revised from episode one to allow for more foreshadowing and narrative development in the first half of the story, such as brief introductions of the world view, so that the second half would not be so packed. As a result, more time was spent in the script meetings themselves. In this process, they discovered it was important to drill down on the relationship between Kaburagi and Natsume, and therefore put more effort to portray their interactions and how they complement the inefficiencies of each other from episode two to episode four. While the production team decided to have a world view of \\"fighting against big monsters\\", they wanted to add a plot twist on top of it. Tachikawa then came up with the idea that \\"actually this world is a creation and operated by something else\\", which was accepted because it was both interesting and could easily allow for added depth when necessary. The team decided to create new designs for the cyborgs instead of using skeletal or mechanical ones, and it was decided that said cyborgs would be hand drawn instead of being made with 3DCG. The design lightly referenced Doraemon, a robot from the future with a cute design. They also considered the cute, organic design as a mitigation to the violent atmosphere of the story. The designer of the cyborgs, Kiyotaka Oshiyama, had worked with NUT during the production of FLCL Alternative. The staff found Oshiyama's design of mechas to be organic and soft, yet still clearly mecha-like, which suited Deca-Dence, and therefore invited him to join the project. The design of the cyborgs directly affected that of the Gadolls; while the team thought it was good to use ordinary designs, for example, dragon-like or spider-like monsters, Tachikawa was worried it would make the atmosphere of the story too violent. After Oshiyama's designs were finished, the team decided to make the Gadolls cuter but horrible because that is what those cyborgs would create. The designer of the Gadolls, Satoshi Mats≈´ra, was invited by Tsunoki via the contact listed on Mats≈´ra's Twitter account after Tsunoki occasionally found Mats≈´ra's character designs on the Internet and thought the style was suitable. Release While the first episode had an advanced premiere screening at FunimationCon 2020 on July 3, 2020, the series officially aired from July 8 to September 23, 2020 on AT-X and other channels. Funimation licensed for streaming the anime. The opening theme song, \\"Theater of Life\\", was performed by Konomi Suzuki, while the ending theme song, , was performed by Kashitar≈ç It≈ç. On August 25, 2020, Funimation announced that the series would receive an English dub. = Episode list =  Reception  Christopher Farris reviewing the series for the Anime News Network gave the final episode a 3 out 5 stars score, concluding that the producers \\"didn't come down as definitively as they could with an alternative to that accursed capitalism, or manage to wrap everything with satisfyingly-tied emotional bows.

It was the first stone theater in the European style in South Africa and one of the first in the Southern Hemisphere. It was also known by other names, such as the Komediehuis, The Theatre, etc. The building was later used as a church by the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK) and stands to this day.  History  The British governor at the time, Sir George Yonge, 5th Baronet, designed the theater and had it built in 1800 in what is now Riebeeck Square in downtown Cape Town. It had no lobby or orchestra pit and the stage small, but the interior was lavish, featuring a balcony and richly decorated boxes for patrons. Underneath the theatre lay storerooms and shops. An orchestra pit was built in 1804. It is two stories and lies on Bree Street. The foundation about two meters below the walls is exposed Table Mountain Sandstone, and the rest of the walls are stuccoed stone and mudbrick. The theatre opened in September 1801 with a production of William Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1. This is commonly regarded as the beginning of live entertainment in South Africa. Both Dutch and British plays were presented. The first Dutch play known to be performed there was a translation of August von Kotzebue's Der Papagoy, staged on March 5, 1803. Theatre in Dutch proved an important precursor to theatre in Afrikaans. The Frenchman Charles Etienne Boniface, who came to Cape Colony in 1806 and was remained active in theatre in South Africa for the next 46 years, aroused much scandal with his works, mostly cabaret. They were racy and commanded attention.  The end  When Anglican Church authorities got wind of the increasingly worldly content being shared there, the theatre was closed in 1836. The slaves were freed at the time and held their first church services in 1838 in the building. Outraged owners, or slaves according to some sources, pelted the building with stones, lending it the name St. Stephen's Church (Saint Stephen was the first martyr to be stoned). On November 12, 1857, the NGK took over the building and made several alterations to suit their use of it. The church is now a national heritage site. In the early 2000s, the St. Stephen's Restoration Trust began refurbishing the building. Original paint colors were approximated based on 19th-century paintings. Paint was stripped from the pews to display the original color of the yellowwood, American pine, and oak used. The restored building was reopened in January 2009.

A snippet of the song was teased in the documentary film Dreamville Presents: Revenge, released on July 2, 2019. The song is described as a posse cut which features contributions from Midwest rappers Saba and Smino, who are frequent collaborators and part of the trio Ghetto Sage. J. Cole's verse on the song revealed he and his wife have a second child on the way. Recording and production Groove said in an interview that the song was produced in 2018, but due to miscommunication and a few missed opportunities, it never came out. \\"I made that beat sometime last fall and crazy enough, I had actually sent that to Cole a while ago.\\" Co-producer Henny Tha Bizness sent Groove a folder of loops and samples including the guitar riffs that was used to make \\"Sacrifices.\\" Groove claims that without Childish Major organizing the beat in his laptop, \\"this song doesn't exist. During the rap camp, ideas were lost so fast.\\" He continued to say in the interview \\"I've based my whole career on sacrifices. For this to be my first placement, it just means so much to me. 'Sacrifices' involves everyone who pushed me to the next level. Childish ushered me into these rooms, which allowed me to be at the right place at the right time. For him to be the one who recorded it, that‚Äôs special.\\" The song was recorded during Dreamville's 10-day recording sessions for the compilation album, between January 6 to January 16, 2019. On the fifth day, Groove described the studio saying \\"it was kind of an energy shift of the artists that were there,\\" as Buddy, Smino, Saba, Mez, and more arrived to the sessions. Olu was the first to record his verse while Smino, Saba were writing their verses and Cole was the last to record his verse. The song was created on the same day and the same room as the Elite-produced \\"1993\\", with a total of ten songs made that day. Critical acclaim A writer for Revolt praised J. Cole's verse saying \\"the song would not be what it was without the Dreamville founder adding his two sense. Coming in hot on verse five, Cole brings it home with a grand finale. Every bar captures the reality of what happens when you work hard and dedicate your living life for what you're truly passionate about. For Cole, it's music.\\" Writing for HipHopDX, Trent Clark said \\"Cole gives the people want they want: some insight into his typically guarded household and openly praises his wife for their good fortune.\\" Lucy Shanker of Consequence of Sound wrote about J. Cole's feature run saying he \\"inhabits the same role he's been in for the past year: a redeeming feature. Just as he did on 21 Savage's \\"A Lot\\" or Anderson .Paak's \\"Trippy\\", Cole exhibits his uncanny ability to both elevate and seal together a song.\\"  Music video  The official music video for \\"Sacrifices\\" was released on August 12, 2019, marking the first visuals released from the album. The video was directed by Scott Lazer, David Peters, and Chad Tennies. The video was dedicated to Olu's late father who died in 2018, and features an appearance from the rapper's mother.

He was also the founder of the journals Revista de Entomologia edited it from 1931 to 1951 and the Studia Entomologica from 1958. Borgmeier was born in Bielefeld, Germany and after studies at the local gymnasium he joined the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor and went to Brazil in 1910. After studying philosophy in Curitiba and theology in Petropolis he took an interest in ants which was furthered after meeting Professor Herman von Ihering of the Museu Paulista in Sao Paulo. An industrialist in Rio gifted Borgmeier with a binocular microscope and helped with reprints on ants from Ihering's library. Borgmeier was ordained priest in 1918, and while at Petropolis, he saw phorid flies parasitizing ants and discussing this with Jesuit priest and entomologist Hermann Schmitz led him to publish the first paper on the biology of Odontomachus affinis in 1920 and describe a new species of phorid Dohrniphora brasiliensis. In 1922 Dr Arthur Neiva helped Borgmeier find more time to pursue entomology allowing him to join the National Museum in Rio de Janeiro as an adjunct research scientist in 1923. Borgmeier became a Brazilian citizen in 1927 and moved to Sao Paulo in 1928 to work under Neiva at the Instituto Biologico. He moved back to Rio in 1933 and headed the entomology section of the Instituto de Biologia Vegetal for eight years. From 1940 to 1952 he served as a counsellor to the local government and was also in charge of the Vozes publishing house. He retired from the publishing work in 1952 and moved to Jacarepagua where he served as a chaplain at a Catholic institution for blind women. He worked here for twenty years during which time he worked on the systematics of ants in the region. He wrote a monograph on the Ecitonines of the Neotropics and passed on his ant collection to W.W. Kempf. He then worked on the Phoridae of the world. Borgmeier was given an honorary doctorate by the St. Bonaventure University, New York in 1945. He was awarded the Costa Lima prize in 1962. The Franciscan Order conferred the honorary degree of Lector Generalis Jubilatus in 1965.

The district included 30 contributing buildings, 10 contributing structures and 34 contributing sites on , as well as numerous non-contributing resources. It includes the Elephant Butte Dam, which was completed in 1916, and resources associated with its construction such as buildings and roads, and including even garbage dumps from that era which were later themselves recognized as archeological sites for studying the construction era. It includes developments during the New Deal era, which created and expanded power generation and recreation opportunities associated with the dam. The district runs roughly along New Mexico State Road 51 from the dam to Mescal Canyon and along New Mexico State Road 52 from Ash Canyon to Long Ridge. The dam itself is important for its effect on agriculture and life in its area and down the Rio Grand valley in both the U.S. and Mexico. The construction of the dam allowed early season water runoff to be stored until needed for agricultural purposes, and addressed water rights claims by Mexico which had come into contention when water supply dropped due to diversions in the U.S. and due to the changing environment. Runoff peaked earlier each year due to deforestation in the upper reaches of the watershed, and was unusable for agriculture which needed water later in the growing seasons. The United States disputed the Mexican claims, but eventually proceeded nonetheless with the dam project and with guarantees of water for Mexico as well as for agricultural areas in southern New Mexico and west Texas. A site lower far downriver, at the El Paso narrows, was considered for a dam, but would have flooded a large area of the lower Mesilla Valley and would have interfered with railway and other transportation. Also a private dam project only 1,500 feet upstream from the final Elephant Butte dam site was in the works, but was eventually stymied by legal issues. The project raised funds from British investors in 1894, and had permission of the U.S. Department of the Interior. It was eventually blocked by the U.S. Secretary of State, Olney, on basis of a technicality that the Rio Grande was arguably a navigable river and permission from the War Department was also needed. Court cases delayed the project, and after an injunction against building the dam was lifted in 1897, the project failed to proceed, and the investors lost their rights to the dam site in 1903. Studies determined that water supply from a dam at Elephant Butte could meet demands of all irrigation projects in the U.S. and Mexico, and in 1906 the U.S. agreed to water rights for Mexico of 60,000 acre-feet per year, despite the U.S. not admitting Mexico's claims. The project was an important precedent. Before this, the U.S. government had mostly given up waterways' control to states; here, the U.S. government found legal mechanisms to take back control. These were applied elsewhere and forever changed balance of power between the federal government and states.

Active in clandestine activities to teach Polish subjects, she participated in lectures for the Flying University and from 1896‚Äì1919 operated a girl's school in Warsaw. The school was one of the top women's schools in Warsaw and upon her retirement was purchased by the government, which still operates as the . Early life Paulina Hewelke was born on 16 November 1854 in Pu≈Çtusk in the Kingdom of Poland of the Russian Empire to Paulina Klementyna (n√©e Baum) and Otton Karol Hewelke. Her father was the pastor of the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Pu≈Çtusk. Hewelke had a younger brother, Otton (1858‚Äì1919) who would become a physician. She attended high school and earned her teaching credentials, becoming the family breadwinner, upon her father's untimely death. Career Hewelke began her career at the government gymnasium in Pu≈Çtusk. In 1883, after Aleksandr Apuchtin began the Russification policies, which prohibited Polish students from speaking their language and studying their culture. He began a series of purges to rid schools of Polish teachers and having little concern for students' education, implemented policies to indoctrinate pupils into Russian culture. Apuchtin demanded that each school have an Orthodox chapel, forbade outside organizations in schools, and among other policies, implemented military drills and exercises in memorization, which Miko≈Çaj Kariejew, a lecturer at the University of Warsaw, stated discouraged students from learning and made them resentful. In 1883, when University of Warsaw student Yevgeny Zhukovich, slapped Apuchtin, causing student uprisings in support of Zhukovich's action, Hewelke quit her job and took her mother and brother to Warsaw. Hewelke worked in private schools, simultaneously organizing clandestine courses in her apartment for women to study science. Later she began working at the boarding school run by Izabela Smolikowska and in 1896 she bought the school, changing it from a six-term school to an eight year program. The school was located at 122 Marsza≈Çkowska Street and occupied the ground floor of the building. The boarding dormitory was located on the third floor. Most of the students were from upper and middle-class families, who were part of the intellectual Warsaw enclave. Some pupils were daughters of landowners from Lithuania and Ukraine and others were from less privileged backgrounds. Hewelke based the fees she charged on ability to pay and often reduced or waived tuition entirely for her poorer students. She organized secret courses on Polish culture and participated in creating lectures for the Flying University. Establishing practical exercises, the created a chemical and physical laboratory for her students. Recognizing the need for leisure, she also organized student summer holidays and supported scouting, which had recently emerged in Warsaw. In 1905, Hewelke hired Zofia Cieszewska, an education women's rights activist, to run the dormitory and teach junior mathematics classes. That year, when the Narodowego Stowarzyszenie Nauczycielstwa Polskiego (National Association of Polish Teachers) was founded, Hewelke, along with and Marcin Szkopowski were on the inaugural board, chaired by . Among her students were writer Maria DƒÖbrowska; Maria Grzegorzewska, who initiated special education in Poland; and children's author, Maria Kownacka, among many others. After the Second Polish Republic was established, Hewelke brought in distinguished university professors like biologist Kazimierz Czerwi≈Ñski, botanist , geologist Stanis≈Çaw Karczewski, sociologist Ludwik Krzywicki, physicist , chemist Stefan Mycho, and mathematician Lucjan Zarzecki, among others. Hewelke earned the reputation of running \\"one of the best women's schools in Warsaw\\" and was active in the Kole Prze≈Ço≈ºonych Szk√≥≈Ç (Circle of School Superiors) of the Warsaw school system. Later life, death, and legacy In 1919, due to failing health, Hewelke sold her school to the government. Former students stepped in to help her, as she became impoverished from an inability to work. She died on 28 January 1924 in Warsaw and was buried in the Evangelical-Augsburg Cemetery, Warsaw. When the government purchased Hewelke's school, they renamed the facility the , and it remained on Marsza≈Çkowska Street until it was partially destroyed in the Warsaw Uprising during 1944.

In 1908 he was a candidate for the United States House of Representatives seat in Massachusetts's 10th congressional district, but lost to Joseph F. O'Connell by 4 votes. Early life Galvin was born in 1850 in Charlestown, Massachusetts. He was named after Irish nationalist John Mitchel. His father, John, was a florist from County Cork and his mother was Irish-American. He was one of three sons. His brother Thomas was a florist and his brother George, was a physician. The Galvin family moved to Boston when Mitch was young. During his youth, Galvin worked in the dry goods commission business. After four years in this industry, he decided to follow his father's footsteps and became a florist. He later started a contracting business and was hired to do boring work on the Hoosac Tunnel. From 1881 to 1884 he represented Kidder, Peabody & Co. in a mining venture in Mexico. After returning to the United States, Galvin worked for his brother Thomas. He later served as superintendent of Mount Hope Cemetery. Political career Upon his return to Boston, Galvin became involved in politics. He campaigned for Boston's annexation of West Roxbury, served on the Jamaica Plain district school committee for many years and was the Democratic nominee for the Massachusetts House of Representatives in Ward 28. He was an avid supporter of Owen A. Galvin and Joseph H. O'Neil and was a friend of Governor Benjamin F. Butler. From 1888 to 1890, Galvin was a member of the Democratic state committee. In 1889, the Boston common council selected Galvin to succeed O'Neil as city clerk. However, his appointment was blocked the Republican-controlled board of aldermen. In 1891 was he elected city clerk. On September 12, 1899, Galvin resigned as city clerk to become the New England representative for four Colorado-based mining companies. He was succeed on an acting basis by his assistant, John T. Priest. However, when Priest was hospitalized on December 27, 1899, Galvin was brought back as city clerk pro tempore. On February 15, 1900 he was succeeded by Edward J. Donovan. The mining business proved unsuccessful and Galvin went into the insurance business with the firm of O'Neil & Parker. In 1905, Galvin joined the Republican Party. In 1908 he was the Republican nominee for the United States House of Representatives seat in Massachusetts's 10th congressional district. O'Connell defeated Galvin 16,539 votes to 16,498. A recount was held, which reduced O'Connell's plurality from 41 to 4 (16,563 votes to 16,559). Galvin contended that some of the ballots that were counted for O'Connell had actually been cast for him. He protested O'Connell's right to the seat to the United States House Committee on Elections #1, which ruled in favor of O'Connell. Later life On May 20, 1920, Galvin was badly injured after being run over by a car. He recovered and attended the 1920 Republican National Convention, where he was a delegate for Leonard Wood. However, on April 7, 1924 he had to undergo an abdominal operation due to effects from his injury. He never recovered from the surgery and died at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital on May 8, 1924.

Taking into account the strategic guidelines of the Russian Federation, the Doctrine is the basis for the formation and implementation of climate policy. It is a document that represents a system of views on the purpose, principles, content and ways of implementing the unified state policy of the Russian Federation in the country and in the international arena on issues related to climate change and its consequences. The document was approved by the order of the President of the Russian Federation on December 17, 2009. Legal basis As stated in the preamble of the document, the legal basis of the Doctrine is the Constitution of the Russian Federation, federal laws, regulatory legal acts of the President of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Russian Federation, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change of May 9, 1992 and other international treaties of the Russian Federation, including those on environment and sustainable development. Basic provisions The documenting part of the Doctrine is made up of alarmist rhetoric, which is not quite typical for the documents that make up the codifying body of texts of the national security of the Russian Federation. It should be assumed that this was due to the increased attention paid by the political leadership of Russia at that time to the problem of global warming. It is also important to take into account the fact that the document was drafted within the framework of the obligations of the Russian side on the development of policies and measures in the field of climate under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Accordingly, climate change in the Doctrine is called one of the most important international problems of the XXI century, which goes beyond the scientific problem and represents a complex interdisciplinary problem covering environmental, economic and social aspects of sustainable development of the Russian Federation. Of particular concern is the unprecedented high rate of global warming observed over the past decades. Modern science is providing increasing evidence that human economic activity, particularly in relation to greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion, is having a significant impact on the climate. The main objectives of the Russian Federation's climate policy, according to the text of the document, are *Strengthening and development of the information and scientific basis of the Russian Federation policy in the field of climate, including all-round strengthening of the scientific, technical and technological potential of the Russian Federation, ensuring the maximum completeness and reliability of information on the state of the climate system, impacts on the climate, its ongoing and future changes and their consequences; development and implementation of operational and long-term measures for adaptation to climate change; *Development and implementation of operational and long-term measures to mitigate anthropogenic impact on climate; *Participation in initiatives of the international community in addressing climate change and related issues. As noted in the Doctrine, \\"the exceptional diversity and scale of climate change in the regions of the Russian Federation and its consequences for the environment, the economy and the population is a natural consequence of the large size of the territory and the great diversity of natural conditions\\". As Arkady Dvorkovich, Assistant to the Head of State, stated at a special press conference on the day of signing the document, \\"according to the opinion of our scientists, which is reflected in the climate doctrine, the share of human influence on climate change remains difficult to calculate. Much of the climate change is related to global long-term trends, and whatever we do, it is likely that some changes will continue due to natural causes, so we will have to take action. Practical implementation measures In pursuance of the order of the President of the Russian Federation of December 17, 2009, the Government of the Russian Federation on April 25, 2011 issued an order which provided for: * Approval of the attached comprehensive plan of implementation of the Climate Doctrine of the Russian Federation for the period up to 2020. * Federal executive authorities are obliged to provide performance of the plan approved by the present order, within the limits established by the Government of the Russian Federation of limiting number of employees of the specified bodies and the budgetary appropriations provided by it in the federal budget on performance of powers in the established sphere of activity. *To recommend the bodies of state power of the subjects of the Russian Federation to be guided by the plan approved by the present order, at formation of regional programs of social and economic development.

Formed in 2017, the group works closely with the Levant Front, the main faction in the 3rd Legion, and included fighters that defected from the Sham Legion. The Glory Corps fought against Syrian government forces, and participated in the Turkish-led Operation Olive Branch against the People's Protection Units (YPG)-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the Afrin Region in 2018. It was targeted by a YPG insurgency in the aftermath of the offensive, when it became based in Afrin. History The group announced its support for the Turkish- based Syrian Interim Government's initiative to form a \\"Syrian National Army\\" in the northern Aleppo Governorate August 2017. This \\"National Army\\" was announced on 30 December, with the Glory Corps as a member of its 3rd Legion. Its leader, Yaman Talju (\\"Abu al-Harith\\"), rejected any attempt to resolve the Syrian Civil War without the \\"overthrow of the regime and the trial of its criminals\\". Ex-Fatah Halab and Sham Legion leader Yasser Abdul Rahim (pictured 2015) is the military commander of the Glory Corps Along with the rest of the SNA and the Turkish Armed Forces, the Glory Corps launched an offensive against SDF-held Afrin in January 2018, capturing the region in March. During the operation, Major Yasser Abdul Rahim was dismissed as field commander of the Sham Legion; Yasser and a number of other fighters from the Sham Legion proceeded to join the Glory Corps, with him as field commander. Talju and other rebel commanders refused to attend a conference in Sochi in January, and returned to Turkey. On 30 November 2018, The YPG ambushed a Glory Corps checkpoint in the Bulbul district and killed 2 fighters. After the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement was defeated by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham in January 2019, its fighters fled to Afrin, where it declared its dissolution after meeting with Turkish officials on 25 March. The Zenki Movement's leadership were all removed, and between 300 and 2,000 fighters led by Abu Bashir and Abu al-Yaman renamed themselves the 3rd Brigade and joined the Glory Corps. The Glory Corps fought in the northwestern Syria offensive since April 2019, during which its fighters killed a number of Syrian Army soldiers with a 9M113 Konkurs missile at the Jabal al-Akrad front on 3 July. On 30 July 2019, Glory Corps commander Maj. Yasser Abdul Rahim announced from Afrin the Syrian opposition's intention to participate in the 13th round of talks between Turkey, Russia, and Iran in Nur-Sultan (Astana), the capital of Kazakhstan. As the military representative of the opposition delegation in Astana, Yasser vowed that the rebels in northwestern Syria will continue fighting, that the delegation will \\"prove to the world that Russia is a criminal\\", and that they will \\"tell the Russians and the Assad regime there that you are the murderers.\\" The talks commenced on 1 August. The Glory Corps participated in the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria against the SDF, which began on 9 October. Fighters of the group secured the defection of 3 purported SDF fighters they captured during the offensive. In early 2020, the group fought alongside other rebel factions and Turkish forces against the government's Dawn of Idlib 2 offensive. On 4 July 2020, clashes took place between the Glory Corps and the Levant Front southwest of Tell Abyad. =War crimes= On 3 October 2018, the Glory Corps attempted to seize 4 houses inhabited by displaced families from Arbin in Afrin city to use as headquarters, but were stopped by the Sultan Murad Division and the Turkish-backed military police. On 27 January 2019, Glory Corps and Sham Legion fighters kidnapped a doctor from his clinic in Afrin and tortured him, accusing him of being a member of the Democratic Union Party (PYD); the Sham Legion denied its fighters were involved. After the SNA captured the border town of Tell Abyad and its surroundings during the offensive in northern and eastern Syria in October 2019, Glory Corps fighters reportedly kidnapped several young men from Bir Atwan village, west of Tell Abyad, and beat and humiliated them. On 22 October, fighters from the group trampled and mutilated the body of what appeared to be a Women's Protection Units (YPJ) fighter they killed in the countryside near Koban√Æ, laughing and chanting \\"Allahu Akbar\\" while they did so.

He was professor at the Musikhochschule Frankfurt. He promoted choral singing from children's choir to adult groups for the state broadcaster Hessischer Rundfunk, namely the Figuralchor Frankfurt which he founded in 1966 and conducted until 2011.  Life  Ickstadt studied music pedagogy at the Musikhochschule Frankfurt. He also studied piano with Erich Flinsch, composition with Kurt Hessenberg and conducting with Walther Davisson and Karl Maria Zwi√üler. Interested in cultural relevance, he also studied German, musicology, philosophy and history at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit√§t Frankfurt am Main. He took classes with Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer, whose philosophy shaped his life. During his studies, he worked as a pianist for radio stations, with a focus on contemporary music, collaborating with conductors such as Pierre Boulez, Dean Dixon, Sixten Ehrling and Georg Solti. He also accompanied singers in recitals. Beginning in the early 1960s, Ickstadt created a new concept for working with choirs, in collaboration with Hessischer Rundfunk (HR), the Hesse state radio and television broadcaster. In 1961, he founded the children's choir of the HR, Kinderchor Frankfurt; an adult choir, the Figuralchor Frankfurt, was formed in 1966. The concept was to begin educating choral singers when they were children and continue with them into adulthood, not only providing systematic vocal training but also expanding their general musical knowledge. Ickstadt conducted the Figuralchor in concerts, radio productions and recordings. The first Figuralchor performances, beginning in 1966, were broadcasts; the ensemble sang its first concert for a live audience in 1970, performing motets at St. Leonhard church. Ickstadt conducted the choir until 2011. Ickstadt was a professor at the Musikhochschule Frankfurt from 1968 until his retirement in 1995.

The lines ran to Sausalito at the southern tip of the county, where connecting ferries ran to San Francisco. Trains consisted of electric multiple units powered by third rail electrification. The lines were the first third-rail electrification in California, and the first major railroad to use alternating current signals. History Map of the lines from a 1939 timetable The North Pacific Coast Railroad was a narrow-gauge railroad constructed in the 1870s, primarily to haul redwood lumber from the Russian River valley. In 1902, a group headed by John Martin bought the railroad and renamed it as the North Shore Railroad. They raised $6 million to modernize and electrify the railroad. The Sausalito‚ÄìSan Anselmo section of the main line was electrified, as were branches from Almonte to Mill Valley and San Anselmo to San Rafael. (Electrification was planned for the San Rafael‚ÄìSan Quentin line, but never carried out.) Revenue service began between Sausalito and Mill Valley on August 21, 1903, and to San Rafael on October 17. This was the first third-rail electrification in California. The railroad was sold in April 1904 to magnate E. H. Harriman of the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP), who had acquired the rival California Northwestern Railway (CNW) the previous year. The common control allowed expansion: a cutoff was built east from Baltimore Park in Corte Madera to the CNW line, which was then electrified from there to San Rafael. (This also allowed the North Shore to use the CNW station in San Rafael.) The new route opened in 1904. In 1907, the two railroads and several others were united as the Northwestern Pacific Railroad (NWP), a holding company jointly owned by the SP and the Santa Fe Railway. Under NWP control, the ex-North Shore main line was electrified from San Anselmo to Manor in 1908. The Santa Fe sold its half ownership of the NWP to the SP in 1929. The SP abandoned several unprofitable parts of the NWP, but invested in the interurban lines. The original suburban stations were replaced with Mission- style depots. New steel cars were acquired, which allowed many of the original wooden cars to be retired. However, even this investment could not maintain profitability. A 1929 brush fire that destroyed much of Mill Valley, and the abandonment of the connecting Mount Tamalpais and Muir Woods Railway that same year, greatly reduced traffic on the Mill Valley line. In 1934, suffering the effects of the Great Depression, the railroad raised fares. The 1937 opening of the Golden Gate Bridge, which made automobile commuting from Marin County to San Francisco possible without using ferries, deeply hurt the interurban operations. Service ended on February 28, 1941. The only remaining passenger service on the NWP was a small number of trains between Tiburon and points north. All of the formerly electrified territory was abandoned by the NWP, with the final San Rafael‚ÄìSausalito section given up in 1972. (That section was, at the time, proposed to be reused as a busway for Golden Gate Transit.) Much of the line between Waldo and Escalle was converted to the Mill Valley‚ÄìSausalito Path in the 1970s. Former interurban stations at Mill Valley, Larkspur, B Street, and San Rafael remain extant, as does the Baltimore Park substation. Operations Four main routes were operated: Sausalito‚ÄìMill Valley, Sausalito‚ÄìManor, Sausalito‚ÄìSan Rafael via San Anselmo, and Sausalito‚ÄìSan Rafael via Green Brae. Manor and San Rafael trains ran combined between Sausalito and San Anselmo, where they were decoupled and ran to their separate destinations. Southbound trains were similarly combined at San Anselmo. Previous electric railways had used direct current signals, which suffered interference from the direct current propulsion systems. The North Shore instead used a newly-invented alternating current signal system, which proved very effective. The signal system in the new subway in New York City was based on the technology used on the North Shore.

Hungerford was born in Mahaska, Kansas to Artemus Manwarring and Bertha Estelle Hungerford (born Barker). He went to the Kansas State Normal School at Emporia receiving an A.B. degree in 1911 and an A.M. in 1913. He was a teacher at the University of Kansas from 1911 and received a Ph.D. from Cornell University in 1918. In 1928 he visited Europe, examining the type specimens of water bugs at various collections. He became a head of the department of entomology in 1924 and was also posted as the State Entomologist for Kansas. During his lifetime he made extensive collections of the aquatic bugs and published numerous descriptions and research papers in entomology. He is buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Lawrence, Kansas. Hungerford married Mary Frances Kenney, a friend from college, in 1905 and they had a daughter.

His art style is noted for portraying the Philippines as \\"a multi- ethnic country that is still embroiled in social issues such as civil conflicts.\\" Active in the Philippine art scene since the 1970s, he is particularly known for his activist art which criticized the dictatorship of former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos. He studied advertising at the Philippine Women's University under the mentorship of renowned Philippine abstractionists Lee Aguinaldo and Justin Nuyda, who helped influenced his early style. His developing affiliation with activist groups eventually led to him becoming one of the founders of the Kaisahan group, which would become one of the bastions for Social Realism in the country. Fernandez's style as a social realist painter is largely defined by his iconography depicting the many trials plaguing Philippine society.

It has hard, dark grey ironbark, egg-shaped to lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and cup-shaped to barrel-shaped and ribbed fruit. Description Eucalyptus farinosa is an ironbark tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has hard, dark grey to black bark to the small branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have glaucous stems and leaves, the leaves petiolate, more or less round, long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same dull green glaucous colour on both sides, elliptical to egg-shaped or broadly lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven on a branching peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are glaucous, oval to spindle-shaped, long and wide with a conical operculum. Flowering has been recorded in October and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, glaucous, cup-shaped to barrel-shaped capsule long and wide on a pedicel up to long with longitudinal ribs and the valves close to rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus farinosa was first formally described in 1997 by Ken Hill from a specimen collected by Ian Brooker on Mount Stewart near Charters Towers and the description was published in the journal Telopea. The specific epithet (farinosa) is from a Latin word meaning \\"floury\\" or \\"mealy\\", referring to the coating on the leaves, buds and fruit of this species. Distribution This tree is only known from the type location near the Campaspe River and Mount Stewart in Queensland.

Biography Dmitriy Filatov‚Äôs father, Petr Mikhailovich Filatov, was a wealthy landowner who married late in life. His mother, Klavdiya Vasilevna Kazakova, came from the serf peasantry. Among his relatives included mathematicians, zoologists, ophthalmologists, and pediatricians. His childhood home was frequented by physiologist Ivan Sechenov.Detlaf T.A. \\"Dmitrii Petrovich Filatov (on the centenary of his birth)\\", Ontogenez. 1976;7(5):427-38, PMID: 800242, who would conduct experiments on the frogs surrounding the Filatov home. In 1894 he finished school in his home region and entered the law faculty at Saint Petersburg University, later transferring to the Department of Natural Sciences at Imperial Moscow University (now Moscow State University), where he graduated in 1900. Participation in student unrest led to a short prison sentence, and in 1901 Dmitriy Filatov entered medical school but left a year later without finishing. From 1902 to 1906 he worked as an assistant at the Institute of Comparative Anatomy attached to Imperial Moscow University. He left to travel in Germany in 1907, and in 1908 took part in an expedition organized by renowned zoologist Boris Zhitkov to the Yamal Peninsula, a remote region in Siberia‚Äôs far north. There he was responsible for collecting samples of flora and fauna. From 1907 to 1919 Dmitriy Filatov served as a zoological assistant first at the Moscow Agricultural Institute (now Moscow State Agrarian University) and then at the Moscow Commercial Institute (now Plekhanov Russian University of Economics). He later returned to the Institute of Comparative Anatomy as an assistant to Aleksey Cevertsov, a founder of animal evolutionary morphology. From there he returned to academia, passing his master‚Äôs examinations in 1914 and serving as an assistant professor at the now-renamed Moscow State University (MSU) starting in 1919. From 1922 to 1925 he was a senior researcher at the hydrobiological station at Deep Lake (Moscow Oblast), and from 1924 to 1937 was head of the Subdepartment of Developmental Mechanics at the People‚Äôs Commissariat of Health‚Äôs Institute of Experimental Biology (later the Institute of Cytology, Histology and Embryology of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union). From 1931 to 1941 Dmitriy Filatov headed the Department of Embryonic Morphology Mechanics at MSU‚Äôs Institute of Experimental Morphology, and from 1936 was a full professor at the university. He became head of Moscow State University‚Äôs Subdepartment of Embryology in 1940, the first such department in the country. At this point he has already long studied embryology, using various expeditions to further his research from his days as a student. He researched the Northern Fur Seal on the Commander Islands (1913-1914), the Caucasian Bison (1909-1911) and the fish of the Aral Sea (1921-1922)Prokhorov, Aleksandr Mikhaƒ≠lovich. Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Macmillan, 1982. In 1916 he conducted pioneering work the inductive action exerted on the embryonic mesenchyme by the auditory vesicle during the auditory capsule‚Äôs formation. This effectively launched the start of experimental embryology in the Soviet Union. He also conducted research on the development of the eye (1925-1936) and on the differentiation of limbs (1927-1932). The main focus of his research was to derive, by experimental study, the laws of individual development in the embryo, as well as the evolution of formative interactions during gestation. Dmitriy Filatov‚Äôs discoveries include the dependent development of certain mesenchymal skull buds, the importance of limb bud volume for triggering differentiation, the nonspecificity of the first stages of extremity development and the peculiarities of certain species during lens formation. The core of his theoretical studies was determination analysis and the complexity of the shaping process. While Dmitriy Filatov had no direct predecessors, he was greatly influenced by Petr Sushkin and Nikolai Koltsov. He went to become perhaps the most prominent Russian embryologist of his dayDetlaff T.A. and Vassetzky S.G. \\"Experimental embryology in Soviet Russia: the case of Dmitrii P.

Early life and career  Lecaroz was born in 1971 and grew up in the seaside municipality of San Juan, Batangas. She spent her high school years at Maryknoll College (now known as Miriam College) in Quezon City, then graduated from the Ateneo de Manila University in 1993 with an AB Social Science degree. She worked as a research associate for the AIM Washington SyCip Policy Center before joining the Sarimanok News Network (now the ABS-CBN News Channel, or ANC) as a news anchor for Stock Market Live. After her marriage in 1998, she settled down as full-time homemaker.  Career as painter  Lecaroz started painting professionally only in 2016 as an offshoot of her hobby of coloring adult coloring books. Her only formal art training was a short, three-day painting workshop under University of the Philippines Fine Arts professor Yasmin Almonte. Inspired by the spontaneous realism style popularized by the Austrian artist VOKA, she painted large acrylic portraits, which led to her inclusion in several group shows. These exhibits include the Ateneo Alumni Art Fair and the Grupo Sining Batangue√±o. Lecaroz also joined the commemoration of the Philippine Independence Day in June 2017 by donating the paintings Jones Bridge in Spontanrealismus 1 and 2 to the Richmond Virginia County Museum and the Jones Ancestral Home Gallery. She also joined the Pintang Laya exhibit in August 2017, where she donated a portrait of student leader Edgar Jopson to raise funds for the staging of the play, Never Again: Voices of Martial Law. Eventually, she held her first solo exhibit entitled ‚ÄúLecaroz Spontanrealismus‚Äù at the Gateway Gallery in Cubao, Quezon City in May 2018. In that same year, she released the copyright for her portraits of the late presidents Manuel L. Quezon and Corazon Aquino, allowing anyone to use those images for free. MLQ by Lecaroz.jpegPortrait of Manuel L. Quezon Cory_by_Lecaroz.jpegPortrait of Corazon Aquino 2019 was a banner year for Lecaroz, with several high-profile exhibitions. These included the ‚ÄúPastel Puro‚Äù exhibit at Galerie Y with pastel artist Gary Carabio in August, followed by her participation in the Center and Periphery show at the National Commission for Culture and the Arts Gallery in September. She also held a one- night solo exhibit entitled ‚ÄúSpontanrealismus Lecaroz 2.0: Honouring Filipino Tycoons & Entrepreneurs‚Äù, at the Rigodon Ballroom of Manila Peninsula on September 6, 2019 as part of the 40th anniversary celebration of Hi-Cool Engineering Corporation. The exhibit featured 50 five feet by four feet portraits of the Philippines‚Äô top and emerging business leaders. Lecaroz‚Äôs portrait of Manuel L. Quezon was donated to commemorate the opening of the Balai Quezon educational center of the Philippine Embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel in November 2019. To commemorate the life of the late NBA legend Kobe Bryant, Lecaroz painted ‚ÄúMamba Forever!‚Äù and released the copyright to her painting last January 2020. Mamba-Forever-Kobe-Bryant-Portrait.jpgMamba Forever!  Style and subjects  Lecaroz is best known for her portraits of influential figures, with several works on permanent display at different institutions. Her portrait of Jose Rizal is exhibited at the Sentro Rizal branch of the Philippine Embassy in Washington DC. Meanwhile, her portrait of Apolinario Mabini is prominently displayed at the Batangas City Capitol building. Historical milieus are also common subjects of Lecaroz‚Äôs paintings; Lecaroz explains that the lives of artists in the Philippines are shaped by the country's historical and cultural milieu. This is reflected in the Sisterhood series of paintings that debuted at the ‚ÄúPastel Puro‚Äù exhibit, which depicted two Filipinas at the turn of the century, enjoying leisurely activities. Meanwhile, the paintings at the Center and Periphery show were based on vintage photographs from the collection of Dr. Bernardita R. Churchill, president of the Philippine National Historical Society. For Lecaroz, art is a personal advocacy; in an interview with Fringe Magazine last January 2019, she declared that artists have an important role to play in raising consciousness and contributing to public discourse. At the ‚ÄúSpontanrealismus‚Äù exhibit, noted painter Fernando Sena reportedly remarked that there will come a time when Lecaroz will be recognized as one of the giants in the art world.

In 1902, ‚ÄúPadres Maristas‚Äù settled down in the palace. In 1918 it was bought by the ‚ÄúCongregaci√≥n de Hermanas del Sagrado Coraz√≥n de Jes√∫s y de los Santos √Ångeles‚Äù. During these years, the Pineda Palace was a convent and a residence that old women lived, and women who moved for studies and works in Valencia, too. The palace could receive 60 persons.. During the Spanish Civil War, the building was undamaged, but the flood of 1957 harmed the building seriously. In 1980 the Generalitat Valenciana purchased the palace and in 1992 it was restored. The palace was restored by Vicente Gonz√°lez M√≥stoles and Alejandro Pons Roman√≠ from 1990 to 1992.  Structure and style  The neoclassical fa√ßade consists of two floors of balconies, built with reddish-toned brick. It is characterized by its symmetry, flanked by two small towers, and ind whose center is a door lintelled. On which stands the coat of arms of the Pineda. The shield is currently very damaged, although you can still distinguish the date of 1732, the supposed year of foundation of the building. It also highlights the legend written in the Filacteria of the shield, with the charge and the name of the holder. The plant of the building is approximately rectangular,whose measures are 23 x 34 meters. It consists of a hallway, mezzanine, two floors and attic. It also has a back garden,built later, which is currently the terrace of the cafeteria. The building has undergone several renovations during its history, such as changes in the walls for the adequacy of its use as a school, and as the turret attached to the rear facade. In the garden area outside the palace there is a sculpture by the painter Joan de Joanes.  Actual use  In the present, the Pineda Palace has classrooms and meeting rooms. They are usually used by the Generalitat Valenciana, the entities whose headquarters is Pineda Palace or another entities with formative or institutional character. In the present, Pineda Palace is the headquarter of the Universidad Internacional Men√©ndez Pelayo and the Institut Valenci√† d'Administraci√≥ P√∫blica.

Goal  The vast majority of computer owners are only users, and only a fraction develop software themselves. Programming has the image that it is difficult. One of the many initiatives to remove that image is Programming Without Coding Technology (PWCT). Although visual programming environments are generally limited in their capabilities and mainly aim to show the user the concepts of programming, one can build almost anything with PWCT. PWCT can also be useful for introducing programming concepts. The project was founded in December 2005 and supports designing applications through visual programming then generating the source code. The software supports code generation in many programming languages. History PWCT 1.9 Environment - Data Entry Forms * PWCT was registered on Sourceforge in December 2005 * PWCT 1.0 was released on 18 October 2008 * PWCT 1.1 was released on 20 February 2009 * PWCT 1.2 was released on 4 May 2009 * PWCT 1.3 was released on 30 May 2009 * PWCT 1.4 was released on 28 August 2009 * PWCT 1.5 was released on 27 March 2010 * PWCT 1.6 was released on 16 May 2010 * PWCT 1.7 was released on 15 September 2010 * PWCT 1.8 was released on 18 October 2011 (Last update : 22 April 2013) * PWCT 1.9 was released on 7 May 2013 (Latest update : 12 February 2020) Concept PWCT 1.9 Environment - Components Browser PWCT 1.9 Environment - Form Designer The visual source inside PWCT is designed using the Goal Designer where the programmer can generate the steps tree through the interaction with the visual language components. Inside PWCT, the visual source is a collection of goals, each goal contains tree of steps and each step/node inside the steps tree may contain one or more of data entry forms. Steps tree uses colors that tell the programmer about the step type. Some steps allow containing sub steps, other steps don‚Äôt allow this, also some steps are not more than comments for the programmer. The steps tree gives the programmer two dimensions where the relationship between the node and another node could be ‚Äúnext to‚Äù or ‚Äúcontains‚Äù where the programmer can go depth-first or breadth-first when he/she interacts with the steps tree. The programmer can use the dimension \\"contains\\" to do an operation on a group of steps/nodes at the same time (move up / move down / cut/ copy / delete). The programmer can use the form designer to design the user interface. The programmer can use the time dimension where he/she can know when each step is created (Date & Time) and can move along the time dimension to see only the steps at any point during the development process. Inside the Goal Designer, the user can use the mouse or the keyboard to select the visual components and generate new steps in the steps tree. Using the mouse we can explore the environment to see the components that are ready for use. Using the Keyboard by typing the component name, the programmer can quickly get any component and start using it. Features * General Purpose. * Visual Programming (More than one dimension, No Syntax Errors, Time Dimension and Colors). * Visual Editor (Keyboard shortcuts, Customization, Cut, Copy, Paste, Search and Replace) * Syntax Directed Editor (Avoid Errors). * Free Editor and VPL Compiler. * The programmer can see and edit the generated source code. * The programmer can change the step name and the steps colors. * Support code generation in C, Python, C#, Harbour and Supernova programming languages. * The programmer can play programs as movie to learn how to create the program step by step * Don't force a programming paradigm. * Extension (Create new components). * Run programs at any point in the past during the development process.

Beatty was a 1792 court case decided in the Supreme Court of South Carolina. A jury charged by Chief Justice John Rutledge held that a slave who had been bought and manumitted by another slave was free, not the other slave's owner's property.  Background  A slave owned by defendant Beatty, referred to in contemporary reports as \\"a negro wench slave\\", had hired herself out for work while paying her owner an agreed-upon monthly sum as a wage. She earned more than the wage she paid to her owner and used the surplus to buy another slave girl, Sally, whom she manumitted. Following purchase and manumission, Beatty did not claim Sally as his property and did not pay taxes for her. However, when Beatty was called on after some time to produce Sally as a free person, Beatty refused; the case was then brought to the courts.  Court case  The case was decided in the Supreme Court of South Carolina in May 1792. Both sides agreed that common law did not cover slavery and could not be directly applied to the case. The defense argued that slaves could not own property and that any possessions held by a slave were legally the slave's owner's property, citing Roman law as precedent; thus, he argued, Sally was legally his property and could not be manumitted by his slave without his consent. The plaintiff argued that Roman law or the law of the Barbary Coast could not serve as a precedent since the influence of Christianity had made slavery in the United States different, that by agreeing with his slave on fixed wages, Beatty had given his implicit consent to do with any surplus she earned as she willed, and that using her earnings to buy another slave's freedom was such a generous act that it should not be overturned. Chief Justice John Rutledge charged the jury in favor of the plaintiff, concluding that Beatty could not have suffered since he received the agreed-upon wages as equivalent of his slave's work, and if \\"the wench\\" chose to appropriate the savings of her extra labor to the purchase of Sally, he hoped no jury would negate such an act of benevolence. The jury, without retiring from the box, returned a verdict in the plaintiff's favor.  Impact  The Guardian of Sally v. Beatty rested on a slave's right to own property of her own. The circumstances were highly unusual, and the decision was contrary to the spirit of the law and was contradicted by subsequent court cases.

She worked as the chief editor of the photography department of the Jiang Su Publishing Company since 1980, as well as for Light and Photography magazine. She retired in 1994 and became a consultant for the Chinese Photographers Association of Jiangsu Province. She documented the everyday life of Mao's China between the 1950s and 1970s. Her photographs are regarded as important resources in the field of Chinese studies. In 2008, Xiao Zhuang was one of very few female photographers featured in the landmark exhibition, Photography from China 1934-2008, hosted in Houston, Texas and commissioned by FotoFest. She was also included in group exhibitions such as Historical Retrospective Part I at the 798 Photo Gallery in 2011 and Grain to Pixel: A Story of Photography in China at Shanghai Center of Photography in 2015. The latter exhibition was curated by the noted British art critic and historian Karen Smith. It travelled to Australia, where it was shown as China: Grain to Pixel at the Monash Gallery of Art, Melbourne, in 2016. However, alongside six other works, Xiao Zhuang's The Irrational Times 39, Nanjing was prohibited from being exported by the Chinese government.

A researcher at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, she was a co-author of a comprehensive four-volume History of India in the Russian language. Life and career Koka Aleksandrovna Antonova was born in a Czarist prison in 1910 in Saint Petersburg in a family of revolutionaries. Her mother was a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party from 1904, while her father joined in April 1917. She went to school in Brighton, leaving with fluent command over English, French and German, to which she was later to add Urdu, Arabic, Spanish and Persian. In 1931, she graduated from Moscow State University and started teaching British politics at the Institute of World Economy and Politics. In 1936, she began doctoral studies, supervised by I.M. Reisner. Antonova married Vladimir Turok-Popov, a historian of modern Europe. Following her mother's arrest, she was treated as a family member of traitors to the Motherland and exiled to Siberia in 1937. She along with Reisner had been denounced by the Indian communist Abani Mukherji as a Trotskyite and an enemy of the people; her critiques of his publications added to the spread of mass repression, in which Mukherji perished. Her husband joined her in exile. She was allowed to return to Moscow in 1939 to continue her studies. She defended her dissertation titled India in the time of Governor-General Warren Hastings in 1940. During the Great Patriotic War, she was evacuated to Tashkent, where she took up Persian studies with the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences. She obtained her higher doctoral degree in 1950 for her work on the religious politics of the Mughal Emperor Akbar. After the war, she joined the Russian Academy's Fundamental Library of Social Sciences, where she edited a bibliographic publication New foreign literature on Orientalism, a massive effort annotating nearly 7000 works every year. Antonova was lauded for her industry and rigour. She was one of six founding members of the Indian division (later, the Centre for Indian Studies) at the Institute of Oriental Studies. At the end of the 1970s, Antonova was forced into retirement. Koka Antonova died in Moscow in 2007. =Academics= In the 1940s and 1950s, Antonova with N.M. Goldberg began the first publication of archival works by Russian travellers to India. In 1952, she published an article on feudalism in India, in which she claimed that from the fifth century onwards, free members of society were taxed, peasants enslaved, and land assigned to feudal lords, who were then able to dominate towns, ultimately delaying the development of capitalism in India. This was criticised for not addressing increased trade despite reduced per capita production of commodities, the latter being a major factor in the formation of state power. Further, her interpretation of source material from the Epigraphia Indica was questioned: she claimed that land grants were made to temples and the priesthood, with no mention that brahmins ‚Äì unattached to any temple ‚Äì were the primary recipients of grants, and that - unlike in European feudalism - there were no feudal dues from the recipient to the royal donor, nor any military service exacted. Antonova began work on the Emperor Akbar because there were no strictures against such research from the Communist Party leadership. She believed she could write extensively on the Mughal king without fear of being accused of counter-revolutionary claims. Antonova's book Essays on social relations and political system of Mughal India in the time of Akbar (1556‚Äì1605) was published in 1952, the first monograph on medieval India released in the Soviet Union. It was acclaimed for its use of original source material and innovative conclusions. A similar critical approval met her second book, The English conquest of India in the 18th century. In 1973, she co-authored a bestselling History of India with Grigory Bongard-Levin and G.G. Kotovsky, which also became a standard text for students of Indology. Critics appreciated the wealth of historico-social data and considerations upon feudalism, the attention to the general culture in the various periods of the Indian middle ages, as well as the remarkable pages dealing with the economic development of India in the early 19th century.

He played for Western Suburbs in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition. Playing career McGuinness made his first grade debut for Western Suburbs against North Sydney in Round 11 1933 at North Sydney Oval. Western Suburbs would go on to finish the 1933 season in last place on the table. In 1934, Western Suburbs had a complete form reversal as they finished minor premiers and the premiership defeating Eastern Suburbs in the grand final. McGuinness was overlooked for selection in the decider. The change in form was attributed to the fact that Western Suburbs lost players such as Frank McMillan and Alan Ridley who were away on tour with the Australian team when the club finished last but returned for the start of the 1934 season. As of the 2019 NRL season, no club has gone from wooden spooners to premiers the following season since Western Suburbs achieved this feat. After the premiership victory in 1934, Western Suburbs went through a period of decline and finished last in 1940, 1942 and 1943. McGuinness became a regular member of the team during this time and was selected to play for New South Wales and New South Wales City in 1941.

Overview The MV Agusta Rivale, which was designed by Adrian Morton, was first shown at the EICMA Milan Motorcycle Show in 2012, going into production in 2014. The styling was a cross between a Supermoto style machine and a naked (unfaired) sport bike. The engine and chassis are derived from that used in the Brutale 800. The machine's name was inspired by the Riva Rivale luxury yacht. MV's CEO, Giovanni Castiglioni, saw one of the yachts in a harbour on the French Riviera and liked the name. He contacted the manufacturers of the yacht, Riva, and arranged for the use of the name. The design partially differs from other MVs, and reflects the larger Brutale and Dragster. It retained the characteristic 3-way exhausts on the right-hand side, saddle and tank shapes and the MV signature rhomboid-shaped headlight fitted into a small front fairing. Technical details The liquid cooled 800 cc engine, which was originally designed by Ezio Mascheroni, is the larger of the two \\"triples\\" produced by MV at this time. The engine has a counter rotating crankshaft, normally only found on GP machines, which counteracts the centripetal forces of the wheels allowing the bike to turn faster. Bore and stroke are 79 mm and 54.3 mm and this short stroke allows the engine to rev to 13,000 rpm. It used DOHC and had four valves per cylinder and developed 125 bhp (92 kW) @ 12,000 rpm. Changes to the ECU, fuel injection and exhaust system gave more torque than the engine of the Brutale. As is usual on modern MVvs, the lattice frame is made from steel tubes with aluminium sections around the swinging arm pivots. The single sided swinging arm is made of aluminium and controlled by a shock absorber. Marzocchi front forks were fitted and suspension travel increased over the Brutale model. Brembo Disc brakes were fitted. The front being 320 mm double discs with radial four-pot calipers, and the rear a single 220 mm with twin pot caliper. The machine used a ride by wire system. The MVICS (Motor Vehicle Integrated Control System) gave four different maps; sport, normal, rain and custom, which allowed the rider great control over the engine. 8 levels of traction control (TCS) were available as well as controls to set engine braking and the rev limiter. Rivale Urban Camo MV Agusta Rivale Urban Camo MV Agusta CEO Giovanni Castiglioni commissioned a camouflage-painted machine for his own use, also fitted with F4 RR wheels and tyres. The design work was carried out by consultant William Melzi of TecnoArt Sersan. Following public interest when the bike was exhibited at the 2013 Milan Show, a limited edition was produced.

The ring was named in-line with the Hantzsch‚ÄìWidman nomenclature. They are structural isomers of the more common oxazolines and exist in three different isomers depending on the location of the double bond. The relatively weak N-O bond makes isoxazolines prone to ring-opening and rearrangement reactions. Compounds containing an isoxazoline ring, sometimes referred to isoxazolyls, have a variety of uses with many being biologically active. A number of naturally occurring isoxazolines with possible anti-cancer activity are produced by marine sponges. Perhaps the most commonly encountered products containing isoxazolines are some veterinary medicines used to prevent flea infestations in dogs e.g. Fluralaner and Afoxolaner. Synthesis 2-Isoxazolines are generally produced by the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of nitrile oxides with alkenes. This has been applied in a diastereoselective manner in the synthesis of epothilones. 700px 3-isoxazolines are prepared from 2-isoxazolines via their N-methylation to form 2-isoxazolinium salts, followed by nucleophilic attack and deprotonation. 4-Isoxazolines are most commonly produced by (3+2) cycloaddition between a nitrone and an alkyne.
