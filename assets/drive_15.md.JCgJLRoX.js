Fulton. Moroland: The History of Uncle Sam and the Moros 1899-1920 (2009) pp 43-58https://claimsabah.wordpress.com/2011/08/31/the-kiram-bates-treaty/ The treaty functioned to prevent the entry of the Sulu Sultanate into the Philippine-American War while the United States concentrated its forces in northern Luzon. Although it is referred to as a \\"treaty,\\" it was titled an agreement, which was of lesser status under international practices as U.S. law did not require ratification of an \\"agreement\\" by the Senate. Background Map of the approximate extents of the Moro Sultanates in Mindanao in the late 19th century, showing the Sultanate of Sulu, Sultanate of Maguindanao, and the Confederation of Sultanates in Lanao. The Spanish Treaty of Peace in 1878 with the Sulu Sultanate had granted Spain suzerainty and permitted them to set up a small garrison on Siasi Island and in the town of Jolo. When the Philippine-American War broke out, the US had to concentrate its limited forces in the north. To hold Moro resistance to its colonization of the Sulu Archipelago at bay, the United States, represented by Brig. Gen. John C. Bates, forged an agreement with the Sulu Sultanate. General Elwell Stephen Otis sent his brigadier general Bates orders to agree with the Sultan of Sulu: Otis mistakenly assumed the Sultan was the ruler of all Moros, concluding that Bates simply needed to enter into an agreement with him acknowledging a transfer of the treaty with the Spanish in 1878. However, with a close reading of supporting documents from the Philippine Commission, Bates discovered that while Spain ceded their rights to the United States in the Treaty of Paris, the Spanish merely held suzerainty over the Sultanate of Sulu and not sovereignty. Suzerainty means a relationship between two sovereigns (yet unequal) states, where the lesser (\\"vassal\\") state cedes certain political controls (such as trade) to the more powerful state, usually in return for some consideration, such as protection. Sovereignty means complete power and authority of one state over another, having only the autonomy granted or permitted by the sovereign power. Otis overlooked this important memorandum which disproved that Spain had a valid basis in international law to include the Sulu archipelago in its cessation of the Philippines to the United States. The memo recommended an entirely new treaty, similar to the British treaties in India recognizing each rajah as a semi-autonomous ruler, using money as a point of leverage. It had been reported to bates that the Sultan's income is notoriously deficient and his desire for American protection is for economic development. Bates used the USS Charleston, the first modern cruiser the Moros had seen, to intimidate the Sultan and his datus into accepting the treaty. Treaty provisions In place of the Spanish treaty, the Bates Treaty included the recognition of U.S. sovereignty over Sulu and its dependencies, mutual respect between the U.S. and the Sultanate of Sulu, Moro autonomy, non-interference with Moro religion and customs, and a pledge that the \\"U.S. will not sell the island of Jolo or any other island of the Sulu Archipelago to any foreign nation without the consent of the Sultan.\\" Also, Sultan Jamal ul-Kiram and his datus (tribal chiefs) were to receive monthly payments in return for flying the American flag and for allowing the U.S. the right to occupy lands on the islands. The Sultan did not want to acknowledge US sovereignty over his land but was pressured to accept it by his prime minister and adviser, Hadji Butu Abdul Bagui and two of his top- ranking datus, Datu Jolkanairn and Datu Kalbi. Hadji Bagui exerted all of his influence to prevent another bloody war, recognizing the folly of armed resistance against a colonizing world power. Hadji Bagui and his son, Hadji Gulamu Rasul later favored the integration of the Moros into the Philippine Republic. A very critical error of translation exists in this treaty. The Tausug version states \\"The support, aid, and protection of the Jolo Island and Archipelago are in the American nation, \\"whereas the English version read: \\"The sovereignty of the United States over the whole Archipelago of Jolo and its dependencies is declared and acknowledged. The word \\"sovereignty\\" was not used anywhere in the Tausug version.http://www.seasite.niu.edu/tagalog/modules/modules/muslimmindanao/jolomuslim.htm Consequences of the treaty Sultan Jamalul Kiram II with William Howard Taft of the Philippine Commission in Jolo, Sulu (27 March 1901) The Bates Treaty did not last very long. After the United States had completed its goal of suppressing the resistance in northern Luzon, it unilaterally abrogated the Bates Treaty on March 2, 1904, claiming the Sultan had failed to quell Moro resistance and that the treaty was a hindrance to the effective colonial administration of the area. Payments to the Sultan and his datus were also stopped but were later restored by the US-Philippine Commission in November 1904. In reality, Bates never intended to ratify the treaty. As Bates would later confess, the agreement was merely a temporary expedient to buy time until the northern forces in Luzon were defeated.https://www.filipinoamericanwar.com/stallingmororesistance.htm See also Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War * Moro Rebellion * Taus≈´g people * Treaty of Paris (1898) * Operation Enduring Freedom ‚Äì Philippines * Spanish‚ÄìMoro conflict References Further reading Grenville, John A.

Early life Langleys, Great Waltham Tufnell was the son of John Tufnell, brewer, of St Mary's Undershaft, London, and Monken Hadley, Middlesex, and his wife Elizabeth Jolliffe, daughter of John Jolliffe, MP, merchant and alderman of London. He matriculated at Merton College, Oxford in 1698.,The alumni appears to conflate Samuel Tufnell of Middle temple with an entry for Nathanie Tusnaile On the death of his father in 1699, he succeeded to the family estate, under the trusteeship of his uncles, Sir William Jolliffe and Sir Edward Northey. He was admitted to Middle Temple in 1699 and called to the bar in 1703. He undertook a Grand Tour through the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Switzerland from 1703 to 1705. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1709\\"Fellows of the Royal Society\\", Royal Society. \\"Fellowship from 1660 onwards\\" (xlsx file on Google Docs via the Royal Society) In 1710 he purchased the manor of Langleys, at Great Waltham, not far from Maldon and in 1719, built a fine red brick house on an H-shaped plan which incorporated the north wing of an earlier house from about 1620.He was captain of a troop of Essex militia in 1715. He married (with ¬£10,000) Elizabeth Cressener, daughter of George Cressener of Earl's Colne, Essex on 19 December 1717. Career Tufnell stood with Sir William Jolliffe as a Whig candidate for Maldon at the 1715 British general election, and was returned as Member of Parliament on petition on 20 May 1715. He spoke in support of the septennial bill in 1716. In June 1717 he exchanged words with Walpole after Walpole insinuated that his support for the impeachment of Lord Oxford, was in deference to Walpole's power rather than his person. When there was a split in the Whig party he was given a temporary place as commissioner of the equivalent on 24 July 1717 which lapsed on 18 April 1719, after which he spoke against the Peerage Bill. After the collapse of the South Sea bubble in 1720 he supported Walpole's efforts to limit the actions against its authors. The secret committee of the Commons on the South Sea affair presented a report containing the names of a number of Members who had allowed themselves to be put down by the Company for stock without paying for it, on the understanding that if the South Sea bill went through and the stock consequently rose, they would be entitled to receive the difference. Tufnell's name was on the list as being allotted ¬£5,000 worth. The matter was not pursued by the Commons and he professed he was able to clear himself after ‚Äòa scandalous list that was handed about giving him as one of the member who received South Sea stock for giving their votes for the South Sea bill‚Äô. He did not stand at the 1722 British general election. After spending time out of Parliament, Tufnell successfully contested Colchester at the 1727 British general election as a Walpole Whig. He voted for the excise bill and against the repeal of the Septennial Act. In June 1732 he was appointed a commissioner for settling commerce at Antwerp, dealing with the commissioners of the Emperor and the States General on commercial and other matters arising out of the treaty of Vienna. He did not stand at the 1734 British general election and after the negotiations opened at Antwerp in 1737, he remained there and made occasional visits to England. The negotiations ended inconclusively on the outbreak of the War of Austrian succession. Although there is no evidence that he practised at the law, he became a bencher of his Inn in 1740. Tufnell was returned on Walpole's nomination as MP for Great Marlow in 1741, and continued voting regularly with the Government. He retired at the 1747 British general election. Later life and legacy Tufnell succeeded his uncle, Sir William Jolliffe, to Pleshey, Essex in 1750. He died on 28 December 1758 and was buried at Pleshey.

Based on datings of human remains, it is believed to date back to the late-Neolithic and early-Chalcolithic eras (4000-2500 BC). The Anta da Estria, the Anta do Monte Abra√£o and the Anta da Pedra dos Mouros (also known as the Anta do Senhor da Serra) are collectively known as the Antas de Belas, and were first identified in the 1870s by Carlos Ribeiro (1813-1882), who is regarded as the \\"father\\" of Portuguese prehistoric archaeology. The dolmen is presently in a much-degraded condition and difficult to access. It was almost destroyed by construction in the 1990s of Portugal‚Äôs A9 motorway but was eventually incorporated into the landscaped area of a service station for that highway, facilitating easy access. However, the service area has since been closed and access by cars has been blocked. Pedestrian access remains possible, using a footbridge over a motorway slip road. Carlos Ribeiro, who carried out research in early 1875 and published his results in 1880, described the tomb as having a polygonal chamber, 2-5 metres wide and 2.75 metres high, approached by a corridor bordered by small slabs of limestone. Later excavations carried out by what is now the Portuguese Institute of Architectural and Archaeological Heritage (IPPAR), of the Dire√ß√£o-Geral do Patrim√≥nio Cultural (Directorate-General for Cultural Heritage), under the direction of Ana Carvalho Dias have shown the corridor to make use of a pre-existing inclined depression in the rock. This dictated the orientation of the tomb, which points to 212-13 degrees west. Ribeiro identified nine raised slabs but did not identify any stones that could have formed a roof. He considered all of the slabs to have been locally sourced, and this has been confirmed by subsequent research. The hard limestone is similar to that used for the other Antas de Belas. Drawing by archaeologist Carlos Ribeiro of the Anta da Estria Limited artifacts have been discovered at the site but many are thought to have been removed prior to the discovery by Ribeiro. Twelve arrowheads were identified, together with two bone artifacts and three small, almost-complete pots. While human remains were found, Ribeiro did not feel confident to identify the number of burials that had taken place at the tomb, which he had done for the Anta do Monte Abra√£o.

From 2005 to 2006, he murdered 4 girls and women in the Voronezh Oblast.  Biography  In the 1990s, he worked in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Kazakhstan. In 1999, Osipenko moved from his native Kazakhstan to the city of Rossosh, settling on the market to sell products to other vendors. He was fond of psychology and criminology, was married, and had a daughter. Osipenko committed the murders in a pattern: he would follow his victim, who lived in five-storey houses on the upper floors, go into the apartment with them, then rape and kill the owner, before plundering the place. On January 24, 2005, in Rossosh, Osipenko killed his first victim, 17-year-old Anna Berezhnaya. The maniac attacked her as soon as she entered her apartment, beating the girl and threatening her with a knife. He then forced her to got the bedroom, cut off her clothes, taping her mouth with a plaster, raping and finally killing her with a piece of metal pipe. On August 17, 2005, in Voronezh, he raped and killed 38-year-old Elena Meleshko. On January 25, 2006, in Voronezh, Osipenko attacked 15-year-old Anna Pobedinskaya, who was returning from school, raping and then killing her. On March 6, 2006, in Rossosh, he raped and killed 13-year-old Yulia Yatskaya, who lived in the same neighborhood as Berezhnaya. There was a witness who saw Osipenko on the day of Yatskaya's murder, drawing attention to his short height of 167 cm. The maniac planned to leave for Kazakhstan, but on April 6, 2006, he was detained at a railway station in the Kurgan Oblast. He did not resist arrest, and spoke freely of his crimes. In late September 2006, the Voronezh Regional Prosecutor's Office forwarded the Osipenko case, consisting of 16 volumes, to the court. He requested that his case be tried by jury, in the hope of gaining leniency and avoiding life imprisonment. But on December 7, the Voronezh Regional Court delivered a verdict, according to which Osipenko was found guilty and did not deserve leniency. On December 14, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.

It is found in the North Atlantic Ocean and a subspecies is found in Alaska. It burrows into soft sediment and under boulders and stones in muddy places. Description This spoon worm has a roughly cylindrical trunk between long. At the anterior end of the trunk, just beside the mouth, a scoop-shaped proboscis about long extends forward. The trunk has about 22 rings of papillae, a ring of larger papillae alternating with several rings of smaller papillae. A pair of hooked chaetae (chitinous bristles) is borne just behind the mouth on the underside of the worm and there are two rings of chaetae on the posterior end of the trunk, near the anus. Internally, the rectum is partially obscured by two long anal diverticula with ciliated funnels. Externally, the trunk is greyish-brown while the proboscis is orange with brownish streaks. Distribution Echiurus Echiurus echiurus has a holarctic distribution, extending southwards in the Atlantic Ocean as far as the North Sea and the Kattegat, burrowing into soft sediment, often at considerable depths. A subspecies Echiurus echiurus alaskanus occurs in southeastern Alaska, its range extending from Point Barrow, Alaska to Puget Sound, Washington. This subspecies inhabits muddy deposits that accumulate around boulders and pebbles in the lower intertidal zone and the shallow subtidal zone. Ecology When burrowing, the proboscis is raised and folded backwards and plays no part in the digging process. The front of the trunk is shaped into a wedge and pushed forward, with the two anterior chaetae being driven into the sediment. Next the rear end of the trunk is drawn forward and the posterior chaetae anchor it in place. These manoeuvres are repeated and the worm slowly digs its way forwards and downwards. It takes about forty minutes for the worm to disappear from view. The burrow descends diagonally and then flattens out, and it may be a metre or so long before ascending vertically to the surface. Here, the worm unfolds its proboscis and extends it along the surface of the sediment to feed, retreating into its burrow when the tide goes out.

He retired in May 2015. His successor is Virginia Ludy, the first female to be General Manager of the CNE. Born in Dallas, Texas, Bednar was educated in theatre and business at Bishop's University in Quebec, initially working with summer theatre programs, such as Festival Lennoxville, the Canadian Mime Theatre and, later, Shaw Festival. He Joined the theatre production company Livent in 1989, before it was spun off into its own operation. He managed the Toronto venues, Pantages Theatre and North York Performing Arts Centre, before managing the Ford Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. Bednar was chairman of the Yonge Street Business and Residents Association during the initial planning of Yonge-Dundas Square, a significant redevelopment to Toronto's downtown. Bednar was hired by the Canadian National Exhibition Association following a decade of financial difficulty for the fair. He made a variety of operational and programming changes over the years. Notably, he repositioned the fair's focuses as technology supplanted earlier attractions. He became a Canadian citizen in 2000, at a ceremony in the Automotive Building, during the company's fair. Early life and career Bednar was raised in Dallas, Texas. His father was a petroleum engineer. Bednar attended the State Fair of Texas while growing up. He moved to Quebec in 1970, to major in theatre and minor in business at Bishop's University. He remained in Canada, married, and became a landed immigrant. He worked at the Quebec City Summer Stock Theatre and Festival Lennoxville, and repaired telephones for Bell Canada. He became general manager of Canadian Mime Theatre in Niagara-on-the-Lake. Later Bednar became director of operations for the Shaw Festival. With four young children to support, he passed on investing in the board game Trivial Pursuit (1982). Bednar joined the theatre production company Live Entertainment Corporation of Canada, Inc. (Livent) in 1989, while it was still a division of motion picture exhibitor Cineplex Odeon. Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb purchased the division from their employers in December 1989, as Cineplex looked to offload assets. Originally the assistant general manager of The Pantages Theatre, he became its general manager. In 1993, he moved to North York Performing Arts Centre to prepare it for the stage revival of the musical Show Boat. Livent used Toronto as the test site for the original Broadway production of Ragtime; it made it world premiere at North York Centre in 1996, and Bednar was involved in production. As of 1997, Bednar was general manager of The Pantages Theatre. and general manager of theatre for its parent company, Livent.; this article mistakenly says Bednar was hired by Exhibition Place, this was corrected in From 1997 to 1998, near the end of his time with the company, he spent a year in New York City preparing the Ford Center for the Performing Arts for its opening and that of Ragtime; he had worked on the production previously in Toronto. He was scheduled to oversee the remake of Chicago's Oriental Theatre into the Ford Center for the Performing Arts Oriental Theatre. Bednar was president of the Yonge Street Business and Residents Association as of 1996, when the City of Toronto approved a public square at Yonge and Dundas, later known as Yonge-Dundas Square. It was part of a larger Yonge Street Regeneration Program. Canadian National Exhibition Bednar was hired by the Canadian National Exhibition in 1998, during a period during a period where both the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds had low profitability or were losing money. The CNEA made just $70,000 in 1997.The CNEA operated at a loss in 1996, turned a profit of $332,000 in 1997, but their portion of severance payments reduced that number to $70,000. (Moloney, \\"$1.4 million paid in Ex severances\\") He said he was being paid less than his predecessor, Bryan Tisdall, who was one of five departing executives that the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds made large severance payments to. When Bednar joined, the 1998 fair was already planned, and he would not comment on its future direction.Bednar was later candid in his criticism of the Tisdall era, highlighting a seniors' pavilion that included a booth to arrange a funeral. (Taylor, \\"For CNE boss, 18 days of fun are year's work\\", 2001) The following year, CNE started promoting its events on weekends, which there was previously a policy against. The change in policy allowed corporate partners to offer discounted or free ticket promotions. This led to a 7 percent increase in admissions, but a large reduction in revenues. According to a city councillor on the CNEA board, the crowding and traffic of the event discouraged potential customers from continuing to visit the event in the final week. In response to the proliferation of the internet, the fair changed under Bednar's leadership from themes of the future to \\"community celebration\\". Bednar-era introductions include the SuperDogs animal variety performance (since 2000), and nostalgia performers at the Bandshell stage for the CNE's established older audience. He has maintained agricultural-related programming, the Exhibition's original focus, as a public awareness effort. Based on the fair's main target audience, families with young children, Bednar introduced a behavioural research study, dubbed the \\"family fun index\\".The 2010 fair was not subject to a Family Fun Index study; Despite Bednar's success in righting CNE through increased attendance, negative attitudes to the fair are still common among the local community.Bednar told the Star that, if \\"it's a good memory, we can't live up to it; if it's a bad memory, we can't live it down.\\" (Daubs, \\"Keeping the grand old lady young\\", 2010. Bednar has featured heavily in the Ex's public profile, and advocated for openness in communications. Food Building vendor Epic Burgers and Waffles' cronuts were tainted by Staphylococcus aureus toxin in 2013, a result of third party maple bacon jam. He advocated that the corporation discuss the issue directly and claimed doing so would increase the fair's credibility with the public. Bednar was President of the Board of the Canadian Association of Fairs and Exhibitions in 2006 and 2007. Bednar retired in April 2015. The assistant general manager and director of operations, Virginia Ludy, succeeded him. Personal life Bednar passed the Canadian citizenship test in June 1999, but it was suggested he should delay taking the Oath of Citizenship until the next year of the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) fair. He became a Canadian citizen at the 2000 CNE, during a Citizenship Ceremony in the Automotive Building. The Citizenship Oath was administered by Bill Withrow, C.M., longtime director of the Art Gallery of Ontario and great- grandson of John Withrow, the Canadian National Exhibition Association's first president. Bednar has an interest in antique cars and has seven vehicles that are a mix of antiques and modern cars. According to Bednar, he took an interest in cars on display at the State Fair of Texas at an early age. He considers himself \\"a bit of a carpenter.\\" As of 2012, he co-owned four residential properties. In 2001, he commented that he had always wanted to \\"do radio\\", and suggested that he might after he retires.

In the period between June and August 2000, a total of five university entrants disappeared in Barnaul: Yulia Tekhtieva (June 29th), Liliana Wozniuk (July 28th), Olga Shmakova (August 1st), Angela Burdakova (August 8th) and Ksenia Kirgizova (August 15th). All of the girls were last seen at the university. During the preliminary investigation, a total of 35,000 people were interviewed, including teachers, workers, students and university graduates. Several of the applicants said that during the exam period, they met a man who offered help with admissions: aged 40-45, of average build, 175-180 cms. in height, with dark brown hair, messy hair and overall nice facial features. A composite sketch was drawn, and later shown on local television. According to said sketch, employees at the Altai State Technical University pointed towards one of their fellow colleagues, who was taken in for questioning, but his involvement in the disappearances couldn't be proven. In total, 71 photographs of individuals who offered work applications at the Barnaul universities were compiled, and even car owners who parked in nearby parking lots were checked, but it still didn't lead to an arrest. In parallel with the investigation, law enforcement agencies uncovered 36 other crimes. In the Altai State Technical University, cases of bribery, as well as sexual harassment by teachers towards students and applicants, were revealed. After checking such information, a number of the professors were fired from their jobs. However, at the same time, in July, two women vanished from the city: 53-year-old Valentina Mihaylyukova from the Romanovsky District (on July 14th), and 43-year-old Nina Shakirova from the Krasnoshchyokovsky District (on July 18th). On September 4th, near the village of Yuzhny, in the forest along the Barnaul-Rubtsovsk Highway, torn clothes, a notebook, a certificate from the State Technical University and a map of the university itself, items which belonged to Kirgizova, were located. While examining the area, investigators uncovered 5 fresh graves in the village cemetery, which the locals didn't recognize. They were opened up, but turned up empty. In early October, near Buranovo, local residents discovered a skeletonized female corpse. Examinations later established that the remains belonged to Angela Burdakova. In the same month, the remains of Kirgizova, Mihaylyukova, Shakirova and Oprarina were found. In 2001, the remains of Shmakova and Tekhtieva were discovered, on May 17th and September 23rd, respectively, followed by those of Wozniuk the next year. Psychiatrists tried to recreate the profile of the alleged offender: he was 35-40 years old, married, had children, has a car and his work allows him to take absences for a significant period of time. =Suspects= On September 11th, a student at the Altai State Technical University contacted Barnaul's Internal Affairs Directorate and said that she recognized a man whom she had seen repeatedly during the exam period. They met in the clothing market, with the man introducing himself as a dean from the Faculty of Economics and offering help with admissions. He was identified as 45-year-old Alexander Anisimov, who had previous convictions for hooliganism and theft, and promptly placed on surveillance. Customers from the market described him as a very sociable and helpful person, a married man with three children who owned a VAZ-2109. On October 27th, Anisimova was detained. When a police search was conducted in his apartment and garage, the police located two axes, knives, a shotgun, a hunting rifle, bullets and handcuffs. Initially, he denied ever setting foot on the grounds of Altai State Technical University, but 11 students confirmed that Alexander had proposed to solve their problems with admissions. Three days later, he wrote down a confession, where he declared his involvement in the disappearance and murders of the five girls who vanished between June and August 2000, with his alleged motive being robbery. While in jail, Anisimov unsuccessfully tried to hang himself on a jacket cord. On November 1st, during an investigative experiment in a 9-storey building on Georgy Isakov Street, in which he was supposed to show a tenant to whom he had sold the murdered girls' jewels, he jumped out of 8th-floor window and plunged to his death. After his death, the murders ceased. However, in an interview with the former head of the Police Department of Barnaul, Major General Nikolai Turbovets, conducted on June 11, 2019, he expressed his still- lingering uncertainty concerning whether Anisimov was the culprit. Aside from Anisimov, other suspects questioned in the June-August disappearances included serial killers Alexey Ryzhkov and Alexander Pavlenko, as well as the Novosibirsk-based gang of Evgeny Kvashnin.

Stele housed at the British Museum, London. Akkadian king Rimush on the shell of a rock snail of the genus Murex, reading \\"Rimush, King of Kish\\". By Rimush's time, \\"King of Kish\\" would have meant \\"King of the Universe\\". Now housed in the Louvre, Paris. King of the Universe (Sumerian: lugal ki-s√°r-ra''' or lugal ki≈°-ki''', Akkadian: ≈°arru ki≈°≈°at mƒÅti''', ≈°ar-ki≈°≈°ati''' or ≈°ar ki≈°≈°atim'''), also interpreted as King of Everything, King of the Totality, King of All or King of the World, was a title of great prestige claiming world domination used by powerful monarchs in ancient Mesopotamia. The etymology of the title derives from the ancient Sumerian city of Kish (Sumerian: ki≈°, Akkadian: ki≈°≈°atu), the original meaning being King of Kish. Although the equation of ≈°ar ki≈°≈°atim as literally meaning \\"King of the Universe\\" was made during the Akkadian period, the title of \\"King of Kish\\" is older and was already seen as particularly prestigious, as the city of Kish was seen as having primacy over all other Mesopotamian cities. In Sumerian legend, Kish was the location where the kingship was lowered to from heaven after the legendary Flood. The first ruler to use the title of King of the Universe was the Akkadian Sargon of Akkad (reigned c. 2334‚Äì2284 BC) and it was used in a succession of later empires claiming symbolical descent from Sargon's Akkadian Empire. The title saw its final usage under the Seleucids, Antiochus I (reigned 281‚Äì261 BC) being the last known ruler to be referred to as \\"King of the Universe\\". It is possible, at least among Assyrian rulers, that the title of King of the Universe was not inherited through normal means. As the title is not attested for all Neo-Assyrian kings and for some only attested several years into their reign it might have had to be earned by each king individually, possibly through completing seven successful military campaigns. The similar title of ≈°ar kibrƒÅt erbetti (\\"King of the Four Corners of the World\\") may have required successful military campaigns in all four points of the compass. Some scholars believe that the titles of King of the Universe and King of the Four Corners of the World, with near identical meanings, differed in that King of the Universe referred to rule over the cosmological realm whereas King of the Four Corners of the World referred to dominion over the terrestrial.  History  = Background (2900‚Äì2334 BC) = Lugalzaggesi of Uruk (in orange) c. 2350 BC, one of the first kings to claim universal rule.300x300px During the Early Dynastic Period in Mesopotamia (c. 2900‚Äì2350 BC), the rulers of the various city-states (the most prominent being Ur, Uruk, Lagash, Umma and Kish) in the region would often launch invasions into regions and cities far from their own, at most times with negligible consequences for themselves, in order to establish temporary and small empires to either gain or keep a superior position relative to the other city-states. This early empire-building was encouraged as the most powerful monarchs were often rewarded with the most prestigious titles, such as the title of lugal (literally \\"big man\\" but often interpreted as \\"king\\", probably with military connotations'). Most of these early rulers had probably acquired these titles rather than inherited them. Eventually this quest to be more prestigious and powerful than the other city-states resulted in a general ambition for universal rule. Since Mesopotamia was equated to correspond to the entire world and Sumerian cities had been built far and wide (cities the like of Susa, Mari and Assur were located near the perceived corners of the world) it seemed possible to reach the edges of the world (at this time thought to be the lower sea, the Persian gulf, and the upper sea, the Mediterranean). Rulers attempting to reach a position of universal rule became more common during the Early Dynastic IIIb period (c. 2450‚Äì2350 BC) during which two prominent examples are attested. The first, Lugalannemundu, king of Adab, is claimed by the Sumerian King List (though this is a much later inscription, making the extensive rule of Lugalennemundu somewhat doubtful) to have created a great empire covering the entirety of Mesopotamia, reaching from modern Syria to Iran, saying that he \\"subjugated the Four Corners\\". The second, Lugalzaggesi, king of Uruk, conquered the entirety of Lower Mesopotamia and claimed (despite this not being the case) that his domain extended from the upper to the lower sea. Lugalzaggesi was originally titled as simply \\"King of Uruk\\" and adopted the title \\"King of the Land\\" (Sumerian: lugal-kalam-ma''') to lay claim to universal rule. This title had also been employed by some earlier Sumerian kings claiming control over all of Sumer, such as Enshakushanna of Uruk.''''''' = Sargon of Akkad and his successors (2334‚Äì2154 BC) = During the 300x300px The earliest days of Mesopotamian empire-building was most often a struggle between the kings of the most prominent cities. In these early days, the title of \\"King of Kish\\" was already recognized as one of particular prestige, with the city being seen as having a sort of primacy over the other cities.''''' By the time of Sargon of Akkad, \\"King of Kish\\" meant a divinely authorized ruler with the right to rule over all of Sumer, it might have already somewhat referred to a universal ruler in the Early Dynastic IIIb period.' Use of the title, which was not limited to kings actually in possession of the city itself, implied that the ruler was a builder of cities, victorious in war and a righteous judge.''''' According to the Sumerian King List, the city of Kish was where the kingship was lowered to from heaven after the Flood, its rulers being the embodiment of human kingship.''''' Sargon began his political career as a cupbearer of Ur-Zababa, the ruler of the city of Kish. After somehow escaping assassination, Sargon became the ruler of Kish himself, adopting the title of ≈°ar ki≈°≈°atim and eventually in 2334 BC founding the first great Mesopotamian empire, the Akkadian Empire (named after Sargon's second capital, Akkad). Sargon primarily used the title King of Akkad (≈°ar mƒÅt Akkadi''').''''''' The title of ≈°ar ki≈°≈°atim was prominently used by the successors of Sargon, including his grandson Naram-Sin (r. 2254‚Äì2218 BC), who also introduced the similar title of \\"King of the Four Corners of the World\\".''''' The transition from ≈°ar ki≈°≈°atim meaning just \\"King of Kish\\" to it meaning \\"King of the Universe\\" happened already during the Old Akkadian period. It is important to note that Sargon and his successors did not rule the city of Kish directly and did thus not claim kingship over it. Until the time of Naram-Sin, Kish was ruled by a semi- independent ruler with the title ensik. \\"King of Kish\\" would have been rendered as lugal ki≈° in Sumerian, whilst the Akkadian kings rendered their new title as lugal ki-s√°r-ra or lugal ki≈°-ki in Sumerian.' It is possible that ≈°ar ki≈°≈°atim referred to the authority to govern the cosmological realm whilst \\"King of the Four Corners\\" referred to the authority to govern the terrestrial. Eitherway, the implication of these titles was that the Mesopotamian king was the king of the entire world.'''''''''' = Assyrian and Babylonian Kings of the Universe (1809‚Äì627 BC) = Neo-Assyrian kings, such as Ashurbanipal (pictured strangling and stabbing a lion), for instance by Urartu and Babylon. Relief housed in the British Museum.250x250px The title ≈°ar ki≈°≈°atim was perhaps most prominently used by the kings of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, more than a thousand years after the fall of the Akkadian Empire. The Assyrians took it, as the Akkadians had intended, to mean \\"King of the Universe\\"''''' and adopted it to lay claim to continuity from the old empire of Sargon of Akkad.''''' The title had been used sporadically by previous Assyrian kings, such as Shamshi-Adad I (r. 1809‚Äì1776 BC) of the Old Assyrian Empire and Ashur-uballit I (r. 1353‚Äì1318 BC) of the Middle Assyrian Empire.''''' Shamshi-Adad I was the first Assyrian king to adopt the title of \\"King of the Universe\\" and other Akkadian titles, possibly to challenge the claims of sovereignty made by neighboring kingdoms. In particular, the kings of Eshnunna, a city-state in central Mesopotamia, had used similar titles since the fall of the Neo-Sumerian Empire. From the reign of Ipiq-Adad I (1800s BC), the Eshnunnans had referred to their kings with the title of \\"Mighty King\\" (≈°arum dannum). The Eshnunnan kings Ipiq-Adad II and Dadusha even adopted the title ≈°ar ki≈°≈°atim for themselves, signifying a struggle over the title with the Assyrians.''''' The title was also claimed by some kings of Babylon and Mari.'''''''''' The Neo-Assyrian Sargon II (r. 722‚Äì705 BC), namesake of Sargon of Akkad over a thousand years prior, had the full titulature of Great King, Mighty King, King of the Universe, King of Assyria, King of Babylon, King of Sumer and Akkad.''''' Since the title is not attested for all Neo-Assyrian kings and for some only attested several years into their reigns, it is possible that the title of \\"King of the Universe\\" had to be earned by each king individually, but the process by which a king could acquire the title is unknown. British historian Stephanie Dalley, specializing in the Ancient Near East proposed in 1998 that the title may have had to be earned through the king successfully completing seven (which would have been connected to totality in the eyes of the Assyrians) successful military campaigns. This is similar to the title of King of the Four Corners of the World, which might have required the king to successfully campaign in all four points of the compass.''''' It thus would not have been possible for a king to claim to be \\"King of the Universe\\" before completing the required military campaigns.''''' The title seems to have had similar requirements among Babylonian kings, the king Ayadaragalama (c. 1500 BC) was only able to claim the title late in his reign, his earliest campaigns that established control over cities such as Kish, Ur, Lagash and Akkad not being enough to justify its use.''''' Both Ayadaragalama and the later Babylonian king Kurigalzu II only appear to have been able to claim to be King of the Universe after their realm extended as far as Bahrain.'''''''''' Even in the Neo-Assyrian period when Assyria was the dominant kingdom in Mesopotamia, the Assyrian use of King of the Universe was challenged as the kings of Urartu from Sarduri I (r. 834‚Äì828 BC) onwards began using the title as well, claiming to be equal to the Assyrian kings and asserting wide territorial rights.'''''''''' = Later examples (626‚Äì261 BC) = 250x250pxThe Neo-Assyrian Empire's domination over Mesopotamia ended with the establishment of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 626 BC. With the sole exceptions of the first ruler of this empire, Nabopolassar, and the last, Nabonidus, the rulers of the Neo-Babylonian Empire abandoned most of the old Assyrian titles in their inscriptions. Nabopolassar used \\"mighty king\\" (≈°arru dannu) and Nabonidus utilized several of the Neo-Assyrian titles including \\"mighty king\\", \\"great king\\" (≈°arru rabu) and King of the Universe. Though not using them in royal inscriptions (e.g. not officially), both Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar II used the title in economic documents. The title was also among the many Mesopotamian titles assumed by Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid Empire after his conquest of Babylon in 539 BC. In the text of the Cyrus Cylinder, Cyrus assumes several traditional Mesopotamian titles including those of \\"King of Babylon\\", \\"King of Sumer and Akkad\\" and \\"King of the Four Corners of the World\\". The title of King of the Universe was not used after the reign of Cyrus but his successors did adopt similar titles. The popular regnal title \\"King of Kings\\", used by monarchs of Iran until the modern age, was originally a title introduced by the Assyrian Tukulti-Ninurta I in the 13th century BC (rendered ≈°ar ≈°arrƒÅni in Akkadian). The title of \\"King of Lands\\", also used by Assyrian monarchs since at least Shalmaneser III, was also adopted by Cyrus the Great and his successors. The title was last used in the Hellenic Seleucid Empire, which controlled Babylon following the conquests of Alexander the Great and the resulting Wars of the Diadochi. The title appears on the Antiochus Cylinder of king Antiochus I (r. 281‚Äì261 BC) which describes how Antiochus rebuilt the Ezida Temple in the city of Borsippa. It is worth noting that the last known surviving example of an Akkadian-language royal inscription preceding the Antiochus cylinder is the Cyrus Cylinder created nearly 300 years prior and as such it is possible that more Achaemenid and Seleucid rulers would have assumed the title when in Mesopotamia. The Antiochus Cylinder was likely inspired in its composition by earlier Mesopotamian royal inscriptions and bears many similarities with Assyrian and Babylonian royal inscriptions. Titles such as \\"King of Kings\\" and \\"Great-King\\" (≈°arru rabu), ancient titles with the connotation of holding supreme power in the lands surrounding Babylon (in a similar way as to how titles like Imperator were used in Western Europe following the fall of the Western Roman Empire to establish supremacy), would remain in use in Mesopotamia up until the Sassanid dynasty in Persia of the 3rd to 7th centuries.  In religion  The title of King of the Universe has sometimes been applied to deities since at least the Neo-Assyrian period, even though the title in those times was also used by contemporary monarchs. In an 680 BC inscription by the Neo-Assyrian king Esarhaddon (who in the same inscription himself uses the title King of the Universe, among other titles) in Babylon, the goddess Sarpanit (consort of Marduk, the patron deity of Babylon) is referred to as \\"Queen of the Universe\\". In Judaism, the title of King of the Universe came to be applied to God. To this day, Jewish liturgical blessings generally begin with the phrase \\"Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha\`olam...\\" (Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the Universe...).''''' In the Book of Daniel, God's kingdom is described as an \\"everlasting kingdom\\".''''' Throughout scripture, it is made clear that the Abrahimic deity is not simply supposed to be the deity of a small tribe in Palestine, but the God of the entire world.''''' In the psalms, God's universal kingship is repeatedly mentioned, such as in psalm 47:2 where God is referred to as the \\"great King over all the earth\\".''''' Worshippers were supposed to live for God since God was the king of All and King of the Universe.''''' In Christianity, the title is sometimes applied to Jesus,''''' such as by Nikephoros I, Patriarch of Constantinople (c. 758‚Äì828) when referring to Jesus abandoning his terrestrial domain for a cosmical one of infinite light and glory.''''''''''

Hispanic and Latino Americans have served in the United States Congress since the early 19th century. The first group elected to serve in the Congress were incorporated as part of the United States territorial expansion into previous Spanish territories of the North American mainland as part of American campaigns of Manifest Destiny. The earliest Hispanic and Latino Representation in Congress came in the form of territorial delegates from newly acquired territories, such as Florida, New Mexico, and more, serving as representatives for territories that later on join the United States with full statehood. The history of Latino and Hispanic Americans in Congress is intertwined with the history of United States expansion on the North American mainland, with expansion into previous Spanish and Mexican lands leading to expansions in Hispanic and Latino influence in Congress. The early periods of Hispanic and Latino representation in Congress struggled from inabilities to gain legislative traction as positions as territorial delegates were often met with skepticism from other members of Congress as they were categorized as outsiders. Important legislative steps forward in the 20th century coupled with expanding Hispanic and Latino influence grew the legislative and political presence of Hispanic and Latino Americans in Congress. Parallels and dissimilarities have been drawn between the experiences of Latino and Hispanic Americans in Congress and those of African Americans in the United States Congress. Among the notable similarities are that the history of both of these groups in Congress have been largely served in the House of Representatives, with Hispanic and Latino Americans not elected to the Senate until Octaviano Ambrosio Larrazolo was elected in 1928. Additionally, like African American representatives in Congress, Hispanic and Latino Americans have taken on the role of surrogates for their ethnic communities, expanding their representation beyond the scope of districts and states to try to begin to provide substantive representation to Hispanic and Latino Americans. One major difference faced by Hispanic and Latino Congress members was the saliency and discussion surrounding race, as many of the early representatives faced lower levels of criticism and scrutiny than early African American politicians. A total of 128 Hispanic or Latino Americans have served in the United States Congress, a majority of which have served in the United States House of Representatives. Of the 128 total, 35 have served as non-voting members of the House of Representatives as either Territorial Delegates or Resident Commissioners of Puerto Rico. 87 Hispanic and Latino Americans have served as State Representatives in the United States House of Representatives, meaning that 122 of the total 128 Hispanic and Latino Americans to serve in Congress, or 95%, have served in the House of Representatives at one point; 3 members of the House of Representatives have gone on to serve in the Senate, the most recent of which is Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey who served in both houses of Congress. A total of 9 Hispanic and Latino Americans have served in the United States Senate, with 4 serving from the Republican party and 5 from the Democratic Party. A total of 3 Hispanic or Latino Americans served in the United States Senate before the 21st century, all three serving as Senators for the state of New Mexico and all 3 of Mexican descent. The 6 Senators remaining served during the 21st century: 3 Democrats, from Colorado, New Jersey, and Nevada respectively; and 3 Republicans, 2 from Florida and 1 from Texas.  History of representation  February 2, 1848 signed Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the Mexican-American War and gave large segments of Mexican land to the United States. = Manifest Destiny and 19th century expansion = The earliest iterations of Hispanic and Latino Americans in Congress were fueled by the territorial expansion undertaken by the United States throughout the 19th century, expansion fueled by the American ideals of Manifest Destiny. Important territorial expansions of the 19th century included the Louisiana Purchase, the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty, the Annexation of Texas, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and armistice that ended the Spanish-American War in 1898. All of these gains combined together to give the United States all or portions of the states of Florida, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming; all of these land gains were previously held by Spain or Mexico, and in particular the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo played a key role. Joseph Marion Hern√°ndez was the first ever Hispanic or Latino American to serve in the United States Congress, serving as the delegate from the Territory of Florida to the House of Representatives from 1822‚Äì1823. The early Hispanic and Latino Representatives often faced racism and were seen as outsiders and foreigners who were invading Congress, especially those who served as territorial delegates, fueled by the territory gained by the United States in the period. The earliest history of representation largely placed delegates as political observers, wrestling with the issues of diminished powers for territorial representation, the language and cultural barriers, and a lack of voting privileges coupled with no real coalition building or political alliances. The language barrier was so notable for some representatives, such as for New Mexico territorial delegate Jos√© Manuel Gallegos, who had an interpreter read his speeches throughout his tenure in Congress. For over 100 years after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed, which ended the Mexican-American War and gave the United States the large portions of the Southwestern borderlands, until the period following World War II, the only Hispanic and Latino Americans involved in national politics were from three states: California, Louisiana, and New Mexico. = Post Spanish-American War period = Octaviano Larrazola, the first Hispanic or Latino American to serve in the United States Senate, was elected in 1928. One of the major questions that arose in the aftermath of the Spanish- American War in 1898 was the question of territorial status on the mainland and abroad. The gains of the Spanish-American War included claims to Guam, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico, and the handling of Puerto Rico in particular proved key to deciding how these foreign territories were to be treated, particularly with the establishment of the Foraker Act of 1900 and the Jones Act of 1917. One of the ways that Hispanic and Latino representation in Congress increased was that it created the position of Resident Commissioner for Puerto Rico, although this position contained some of the same restrictions previously experienced by territorial delegates. The period also saw some substantive gains as it saw the first two Latino Senators ever elected, led by the election of Octaviano Ambrosio Larrazola in 1928. Dennis Ch√°vez of New Mexico followed suit by being elected in 1935 and becoming the first Hispanic or Latino American to serve in both the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate; Ch√°vez also importantly represented a continued trend of political representation leading to substantive and surrogate representation of Hispanic and Latino American interests more widely, and was one of the earliest advocates for Hispanic and Latino American civil rights. This period represented important gains that would be built upon in the period following World War II and beyond.  The modern era  = Post World War II representation = The aftermath World War II proved another time for increased representation for Hispanic and Latino Americans in Congress, fueled by desires for equal rights born out of experiences fighting for the country abroad. Increased political representation in Congress was coupled with local activism and civil rights organizations was the path forward for Hispanic and Latino Americans seeking change, leading to the formation of more far-reaching activism of the Chicano Movement. Hispanic and Latino American politicians continued to make gains in important positions in Congress, and for the first time in this period had an equal number of full voting members in Congress and non-voting delegates. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus was founded in 1976. Pictured are members of the Caucus gathered together in 1984. The period following World War II continued to be marked by strides in representation, encapsulated by the formation of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in 1976; the formation of the Caucus represented the coming together of a Hispanic and Latino movement and a larger identity united behind common goals of civil rights, political representation, and to encourage participation amongst Hispanic and Latino Americans. This period also represented a time of rapid increase in descriptive representation within Congress, with increases from 7 Hispanic or Latino Americans in the 95th United States Congress in 1977 to the 47 of the 116th Congress of 2019; more than 60% of the Hispanic and Latino American representatives in Congress were seated after 1977. = 21st century = Major gains in Hispanic and Latino American representation have been made in both houses of Congress during the 21st century. 6 new Senators were elected in the new century, prior to the 21st century, only 3 Hispanic or Latino Americans had ever served in the United States Senate. Currently, there are 47 members of the 116th United States Congress who are Latino or Hispanic Americans. 40 of these members are Representatives in the United States House of Representatives, 4 of them are members of the United States Senate, and the final 3 members are territorial delegates. The 116th Congress contains a record number of 4 Senators: Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey; Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida; Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas; and Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat from Nevada.

Horodkivka was called Khalaimgorodok before 1946. The church overlooks a small lake in the southwestern part of Horodok, near the road leading to Berdichev, on the low bank of the river Lebedivka. It is constructed in an eclectic style with elements of neo-Gothic and modern twentieth century architecture. Origins The Polish writer-memoirist Efstafy Ivanovsky, who wrote under the name Hellenius, was born in the village on 17 January 1813; he lived in the village for almost all his life and was a devout Roman Catholic, making numerous pilgrimages. His mother Clara Ivanovsky died in 1859, and he inherited estates in Halaimgorodok, as well as the desire to build a church to honour St. Clare, the patron saint of his mother. He was, however, unable to obtain the necessary permission from the Russian authorities, who brutally repressed the Polish nobility in response to the armed uprisings of 1831 and of 1863. Efstafy Ivanovsky died on 7 July 1903, and it was left to his heirs, villagers 54-year-old Anna and 60-year-old Romuald Zmigrodzky, to fulfil Ivanovsky's last wishes and build the church. A stone chapel had already been built in the village in 1818 by Mr. Michalovsky (–ú—ñ—Ö–∞–ª–æ–≤—Å—å–∫–∏–º), with the permission of the diocesan authorities. On the site of this chapel, between 1910 and 1913, the Church of St. Clare was constructed by Polish builders, together with inhabitants of the village and of the neighbouring village of Zherdeli, under the direction of the builder E. Yablonsky and technologist A. Khodak. The church was built in the style of a mediaeval castle or manor house using stone and brick and the roof was of Polish red tiles. The belfry had three bells, the largest of which weighed 150 kg. The doors were massive and forged and the windows were glazed with colored stained glass, there were wall paintings, and a crystal chandelier hung in the middle of the sanctuary. The acoustics were excellent. History In 1935 under the communist government in Soviet Ukraine, the Khalaimgorod parish ceased to exist and the church was used as a village club. They removed the bells from the bell tower, and the statue of the Mother of God at the entrance was knocked down from the base and thrown into the lake. Amateur performances took place in the church. During the Second World War, after the establishment of the German occupying power in the village, the religious life of the parish was restored under Father Joseph Kozinsky and worship was conducted from 1943 to 1959. However, in 1961, after the return of Soviet power, the building was returned to secular use as a collective farm barn by decision of the Zhytomyr Oblast Executive Committee, and the organ and wall paintings were destroyed. In 1989, the church was transferred back to the Roman Catholic community of Carmelites. At the expense of the community, the building has been restored, including the belfry, and the surroundings have been planted with flowers. The church now has several local icons, an antique harpsichord and a relic of Pope John Paul II, and is an active church in the Ruzhin Deanery of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kyiv-Zhytomyr. The building is now well known as a local landmark and generates interest as a tourist attraction. A special celebration is held each year on August 11.

Calgary previously hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics. The bid was withdrawn after a local referendum in which 56.4% of Calgary voters rejected the bid. History Calgary hosted the highly successful 1988 Winter Olympics and posed the bid as \\"a catalyst to renew the legacies of 1988\\". The Olympics were projected to cost Calgary between CAN$5 - 5.1 billion but funding deals meant Alberta would have paid CAN$700 million and the IOC would have contributed CAN$1.2 billion. A Calgary Bid Exploration Committee was established and returned a report to Council and the public.City of Calgary website There was speculation that Calgary City Council would cancel the bid before the public vote with reports that the mayor Naheed Nenshi was ready to officially end the bid over funding complications. This proved unfounded after the council voted against cancelling the bid early; eight of the city's 15 councillors voted to kill the proposals, two short of the two-thirds super-majority needed to end the Olympic bid. Calgarians were given a non-binding vote on the Olympic bid on 13 November 2018. Voters had to be over 18, a resident of Calgary on the vote day and a Canadian citizen and were asked \\"Are you for or are you against Calgary hosting the 2026 Olympic and Paralympic Games?\\". The city voted against the proposed plans, with 56.4% opposing and 43.6% supporting the bid and turnout at 40%. Only one of Calgary's 14 wards voted in favour of holding the Games. After the plebscite, the City Council unanimously voted to suspend the bid on 19 November 2018, leaving just two joint bids vying for the 2026 games: Stockholm-√Öre and Milan‚ÄìCortina d'Ampezzo. Previous bids Calgary had previously bid for several Olympic Games, often with the help of the Calgary Olympic Development Association. It bid for the 1964 Winter Olympics losing to Innsbruck, Austria and the 1968 Winter Olympics losing to Grenoble, France. The city partnered with Banff for its third bid and looked set to win the 1972 games, but environmental worries about plans for the development of parts of the Banff National Park meant it finished second to Sapporo, Japan. Calgary won the right to represent the Canadian Olympic Association for the 1988 games, defeating a rival bid from Vancouver. The city was opposed by bids from Falun, Sweden and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. Calgary was confirmed as the host for the 1988 games at the 84th IOC Session in Baden-Baden in 1981. Venues 80% of the venues for the bid were pre-existing or temporary. =Sporting venues= In Calgary, pre-existing venues included the Olympic Oval for speed skating, the McMahon Stadium for the Opening and Closing ceremonies, the Saddledome (the home of the Calgary Flames) for ice hockey. Planned venues included a medium-sized arena for ice hockey with a capacity of 5000 (intended to serve as a replacement of the Stampede Corral) and a multi-sport complex for figure and short track speed skating with a capacity of 10,000. =Olympic Village= The main Olympic Village was proposed to be in Calgary and have a capacity of 2900 with smaller villages in Canmore (capacity of 1050), Nakiska (capacity of 1000) and Whistler (capacity of 350). =Non-sporting venues= The broadcasting centre would have been in the existing BMO Centre.

The track was released on his 1986 album Blood & Chocolate after several failed attempts to record the song for earlier releases. Featuring sardonic lyrics about a former relationship, \\"I Hope You're Happy Now\\" as the B-side to \\"I Want You\\" in November 1986. It has since been positively received by critics and appeared on compilation albums and in Costello's live setlists. Background According to Elvis Costello, the final version of \\"I Hope You're Happy Now\\" was recorded after \\"three different attempts\\" to get the song right. Costello and the Attractions attempted to record the song after Goodbye Cruel World with Nick Lowe, who had not produced a Costello album since Trust, but these recordings were shelved. An early version of the song was performed by Costello and the Attractions on the Tonight Show in 1984. The song was later attempted again during the King of America sessions; early versions of the song have since been released on expanded versions of both Goodbye Cruel World and King of America. He recalled, The version released on Blood and Chocolate was, according to Costello, ultimately \\"recorded live in the big, old studio at Olympic (before it was vandalized)\\". Costello noted that, during the sessions, \\"We also finally got a take on 'I Hope You're Happy Now' that had a little more humour to it than its originally murderous intent. It almost sounded like pop music\\". Stylistically, \\"I Hope You're Happy Now\\" has been dubbed a \\"garage rock\\" effort. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic described the song as one where Costello \\"ridicules [the girl who broke his heart] with 'He's got all the things you need and some that you will never/But you make him sound like frozen food/His love will last forever'.\\" Costello said of the song's lyrics, \\"In the long run I'm happier to live with it being humorous, rather that murderous\\". Release and reception \\"I Hope You're Happy Now\\" was first released as the second track on Blood & Chocolate. An acoustic version of the song was released as the B-side to \\"I Want You\\" in November 1986, but no version of the track was ever released on a single of its own. Writer Graeme Thomson said of this choice, \\"With pop songs of the calibre of 'Blue Chair' and 'I Hope You're Happy Now' at his disposal, to release the doggedly uncommercial 'I Want You' and 'Tokyo Storm Warning'‚Äîboth over six minutes long‚Äî as the first two UK singles was a willfully perverse move\\". The song has also been released on the compilation albums Girls Girls Girls and The Very Best of Elvis Costello. \\"I Hope You're Happy Now\\" has seen critical acclaim since its release. Ryan J. Prado of Paste Magazine ranked it Costello's 17th best song, called it \\"a song so instantly gratifying and anthemic I'm surprised it's impossible to put it at #1 on this list\\". He continued, \\"Costello's ability to talk shit about people with eloquence is second to none, and put into striking, reverential spotlight here\\". Stewart Mason of AllMusic said of the song, \\"Unlike the more studied attempts at recreating the old Attractions sound on 1994's Brutal Youth, this works perfectly, both as a nostalgia trip and as a song\\". Bryan Wawzenek of Diffuser.fm praised the song's \\"Beatle-esque beat\\", while Chris Mautner of The Patriot-News described it as his \\"favorite song\\". Live history Since its release, \\"I Hope You're Happy Now\\" has appeared frequently in Costello's live setlists. A version of the song appears on the Costello live album The Return Of The Spectacular Spinning Songbook. Costello continues to perform the song in his later career, playing it during his \\"Just Trust\\" tour in 2019.

(2006). The priority heuristic: Making choices without trade-offs. Psychological Review, 113, 409‚Äì432. The heuristic maps onto Rubinstein‚Äôs three-step-model, according to which people first check dominance and stop if it is present, otherwise they check for dissimilarity.Rubinstein, A. (1988). Similarity and decision making under risk (Is there a utility resolution to the Allais-paradox?). Journal of Economic Theory, 46, 145‚Äì153. To highlight Rubinstein‚Äôs model consider the following choice problem: I: 50% chance to win 2,000 :50% chance to win nothing II: 52% chance to win 1,000 :48% chance to win nothing Dominance is absent, and while chances are similar monetary outcomes are not. Rubinstein‚Äôs model predicts that people check for dissimilarity and consequently choose Gamble I. Unfortunately, dissimilarity checks are often not decisive, and Rubinstein suggested that people, proceed to a third step that he left unspecified. The priority heuristic elaborates on Rubinstein‚Äôs framework by specifying this Step 3.  Priority heuristic  For illustrative purposes consider a choice between two simple gambles of the type ‚Äúa chance c of winning monetary amount x; a chance (100 - c) of winning amount y.‚Äù A choice between two such gambles contains four reasons for choosing: the maximum gain, the minimum gain, and their respective chances; because chances are complementary, three reasons remain: the minimum gain, the chance of the minimum gain, and the maximum gain. For choices between gambles in which all outcomes are positive or 0, the priority heuristic consists of the following three steps (for all other choices see Brandst√§tter et al. 2006): Priority rule: Go through reasons in the order of minimum gain, chance of minimum gain, and maximum gain. Stopping rule: Stop examination if the minimum gains differ by 1/10 (or more) of the maximum gain; otherwise, stop examination if chances differ by 10% (or more). Decision rule: Choose the gamble with the more attractive gain (chance). The term ‚Äúattractive‚Äù refers to the gamble with the higher (minimum or maximum) gain and to the lower chance of the minimum gain.  Examples  Consider the following two choice problems, which were developed to support prospect theory, not the priority heuristic.Kahneman, D., & Tversky, A. (1979). Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk. Econometrica, 47, 263‚Äì291. Problem 1 A: 80% chance to win 4,000 :20% chance to win nothing B: 100% chance to win 3,000 Most people chose B (80%). The priority heuristic starts by comparing the minimum gains of the Gambles A (0) and B (3,000). The difference is 3,000, which is larger than 400 (10% of the maximum gain), examination is stopped; and the heuristic predicts that people prefer the sure gain B, which is in fact the majority choice.A Problem 2 C: 45% chance to win 6,000 :55% chance to win nothing D: 90% chance to win 3,000 :10% chance to win nothing Most people (86%) chose Gamble D. The priority heuristic starts by comparing the minimum gains (0 and 0). Because they do not differ, the probabilities (.45 and .90 or their logical complements .55 and .10) are compared. This difference is larger than 10%, examination stops and people are correctly predicted to choose D because of its higher probability of winning.  Empirical support and limitations  The priority heuristic correctly predicted the majority choice in all (one-stage) gambles in Kahneman and Tversky (1979). Across four different data sets with a total of 260 problems, the heuristic predicted the majority choice better than (a) cumulative prospect theory, (b) two other modifications of expected utility theory, and (c) ten well-known heuristics (such as minimax or equal-weight) did. However, the priority heuristic fails to predict many simple decisions (that are typically not tested in experiments)Rieger, M. & Wang, M. (2008).

Badly damaged by an air raid attack in 1941 it was subsequently restored but closed in the 1980s. Services were held in the Welsh language. Foundation and early history A chapel was registered at Cwmbach in April 1841, and the Rev. William Lewis of Carmel Penpound (which preceded Calfaria, Aberdare, was one of the signatories. The earliest services were held at a building known as 'The Square' at Abernant-y-Groes. In 1964, according to Ifor Parry, the date 1841 was still visible on the original building. One of the Baptist pioneers at Cwmbach was William Thomas David of Abernant-y-groes Uchaf, who owned the land where the first deep mine in the Aberdare Valley to produce sale coal was opened in 1837. Hitherto, all the coal produced in the locality had been for use in the ironworks. The church was incorporated on 14 and 15 January 1845. Morgan Lewis was the first minister from 1845. The Education Reports of 1847 state that his annual stipend was ¬£40 per annum and that he sustained himself by keeping a day school. Morgan Lewis he died of cholera in 1849. J.D. Williams was inaugurated as the second minister in 1851 and also ran a day school. Williams left in 1855. T.E. Jones was then inaugurated as minister in the same year but his tenure was also brief and he departed to Glyn-neath in 1858. A new chapel was built in 1858 by William Lewis. The former building was subsequently sold to the Unitarians. The next minister was William Harris from 1859, but in 1862 he moved to the nearby church at Heolyfelin. A vestry was added in 1865. In that year, Walter Samuel became minister and remained until his departure to Liverpool in 1878. From 1878 until 1887 the church was overseen by a lay minister, Robert James. David Thomas, a native of Letterston in Pembrokeshire who had recently completed his studies at Pontypool College, was ordained as minister on 1 and 2 January 1888 and remained until his early death in January 1902. During his time at Cwmbach, David Thomas served as a member of the Aberdare School Board. Twentieth century In 1903, the Rev. Joseph James was inaugurated as minister. He remained for nearly 25 years before his departure to Amlwch in 1927. Membership peaked following the 1904-05 Religious Revival. There were 469 members in 1906 but this fell to 273 by 1932. G.J. Morgan, a student from Carmarthen College, was ordained as minister of Bethania in 1930. He departed for Australia in 1937. Wartime damage On 30 May 1941 the chapel was badly damaged by enemy war action and the adjoining vestry completely destroyed. Nevertheless, the chapel celebrated its centenary in 1944 and services were held at the schoolroom at Ynyscynon which had been built during the ministry of Joseph James. The chapel was eventually restored in 1950/51 and re-opened on 14 April 1951. Later history Idris Williams, who came from Calfaria, Penygroes, was minister from 1946 until 1956. He was succeeded by D.W. Thomas from 1961. By 1978 there were only fifteen members and the chapel closed around 1980. The building was demolished in 1995.

Prussian forces under the overall command of Frederick II laid siege to the city of Schweidnitz, in an attempt to retake it from an Austrian garrison. Background Schweidnitz was the anchor of Prussia's position in Silesia during the war, due to its central location and major supply depots.Szabo p.338 It had been stormed the previous year by Austrian forces under Ernst Gideon von Laudon.Szabo p.364 The Austrians hoped to hold onto the city as a bargaining chip in any potential peace talks. Frederick was equally determined to recover the city, particularly as the departure of Russia and Sweden from the war allowed him to take the offensive once more. Siege and relief attempts Having isolated Schweidnitz from the main Austrian field army under Leopold Joseph von Daun, siege works were begun and a major bombardment commenced on 9 August. He deployed a force under Duke of Bevern to a covering position at Reichenbach where he was able to frustrate Daun's attempts to march to the city's aid in action which produced 1,000 casualties.Szabo p.400 Six days after the defeat of this relief attempt, the commander of Schweidnitz offered to surrender the city. However, Frederick rejected his demand that his men be allowed to march away with the honours of war. Frederick demanded instead that the entire garrison surrender as prisoners of war, and the siege continued.Szabo p.400 In September he threatened to put the garrison to the sword if they did not surrender immediately. The Prussians were able to thwart another major effort by Daun to relieve the garrison. On 8 October a Prussian mine, dug under the city, exploded the garrison's gunpowder magazine. The following day, Schweidnitz finally capitulated. Both sides had suffered around 3,000 casualties during the two month siege.Szabo p.413 In recognition of the city's resistance, the Austrian Empress Maria Theresa promoted the senior offices and rewarded the entire garrison following their release from captivity.Sazbo p.413 Aftermath Along with the Prussian victory at Battle of Freiberg, it was one of the final acts of the war. A peace agreement was signed between the warring sides in early 1763. The Treaty of Hubertusburg acknowledged the return of all Silesian territory to Prussia.

She creates novel proteins that can be used in drug delivery, tissue regeneration and as medical treatment. She is a 2019 AAAS Leshner Leadership Fellow and has been inducted to the AIMBE College of Fellows. Early life and education Montclare was born in The Bronx. She is a first-generation Korean American. She became interested in chemistry at high school. She studied at Fordham University, where she majored in chemistry and minored in philosophy. She earned her bachelor's degree in 1997. She was awarded the Merck Index Award for excellence in organic chemistry and Clare Boothe Luce Scholarship for women in science. Montclare was elected a member of Iota Sigma Pi. She moved to Yale University for her graduate degree, earning master's in 2001 and a PhD in 2003. She worked in the lab of Alanna Schepartz, completing a thesis on the recognition of DNA by natural transcription factors. Her graduate research was supported by National Science Foundation and Pfizer. She attributes her passion for chemistry to her mentors, including her grandmother. Research and career Montclare joined California Institute of Technology as an National Institutes of Health postdoctoral fellow, where she began to work on engineering new molecules with David A. Tirrell. She joined New York University in 2005, where she leads the Protein Engineering and Molecular Design Lab. Montclare has worked with the United States Department of Defense to detoxify organophosphates, which are commonly used in pesticides and as warfare agents. She develops stable, activate fluorinated phosphotriesterase (PTE) variants by combining PTE with non-canonical amino acids. She has also developed protein-engineered hydrogels that could be used as biomimetic materials. Instead of synthetically creating polymers, Montclare uses biologically engineered proteins that can be easily controlled by external stimuli. Montclare's protein-based hydrogels can be used to direct neuronal growth for brain augmentation. The hydrogels could be used to heal wounds, sense or control the flow of fluids or deliver medicine. They are made from Escherichia coli bacterium which are patterned onto substrates, similar to how geckos can adhere to surfaces. The She has developed a range of other nanomaterials derived from proteins, including coiled-coil fibres and helix-elastin block polymers. Other research in the Montclare group includes the design of protein-lipid macromolecular systems that can be used to transport nanoparticles, drugs and genes to treat a variety of medical conditions. The lipoprotoeplexes can be used to deliver drugs and genes across many types of cells in a GeneTrain. They can form complexes with nucleic acid and small hydrophobic drugs. The lipid container permits transfection past a cell membrane, whilst the protein capsule can bind chemotherapeutic molecules. =Public engagement and advocacy= Montclare has been involved with outreach programs to introduce people in K-12 Education to science studies at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. She hosts a group of high school students for research opportunities every summer as well as leading outreach programs in Brooklyn high schools. Montclare is part of the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program, and since 2013 has directed the New York University Tandon I-Corps site, the Convergence of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE) Institute. At the CIE Montclare seeks to increase the representation of women and underrepresented minority entrepreneurs, with the hope to increase their participation in STEM careers. Whilst only 20% of engineering students in the United States are women, at New York University women make up between 40 and 45%.

He played a pivotal role in bringing together the Hispanic population by writing for Spanish newspapers and his involvement in politics. His most famous work Memoirs of Bernardo Vega was published in 1977 and detailed the lives and struggles of the new immigrants from Puerto Rico to New York City. The Memoir is considered to be an important piece of Puerto Rican literature, because of its accounts regarding how Puerto Ricans adjusted to a new culture and life in the United States.  Early Life and Migration  Bernardo Vega was born in 1885 in Cayey, Puerto Rico. Cayey was a town known for tobacco, where tabaqueros, also known as cigar-makers, would work to grow it. Vega was a tabaquero, which was, to the working class, an intellectual job because during their work someone would read to them. This eventually led Vega to finding jobs of this same caliber in New York. He moved there in 1916. He was a strong advocator for better working conditions and rights, as well as a member of the Puerto Rican socialist labor movement. Vega got married in 1918 and had two children, but later divorced and remarried again in 1929.  New York City and Memoirs of Bernardo Vega  When Vega first arrived to New York City in 1916, the Puerto Rican population was only a few thousand. Many of these migrants came from the cigar making profession in Puerto Rico and Cuba. This led to employment for many of these migrants at cigar-making shops or other factories, where their tabaquero skills were used. An advocate for workers‚Äô rights while living in Puerto Rico, he continued his involvement in the community by buying Gr√°fico, a Spanish newspaper in 1927. Vega used this newspaper to bring together the Hispanic community that was scattered in New York at the time. He wrote about the problems that Puerto Ricans faced in reference to politics, economics, and society. This is where he began to write memoirs, detailing accounts of Puerto Rican life in the United States. His most famous work Memoirs of Bernardo Vega was published in 1977, years after his death, but he had written it sometime in the 1940s. The book starts when Antonio Vega, Bernardo's uncle, came to New York in 1857. It did not focus on Vega himself, but Puerto Ricans' perspective as a whole. He also talked about the colonia, a reference to a section of New York City that was heavily populated by Puerto Ricans, along with the culture and society there. It was seen as an important place for immigrants who had come to New York City, forming a community. The book mentioned the role of Puerto Ricans and how they interacted with politics, social life, and the American culture, as well as problems of discrimination and poverty that Puerto Ricans faced in the city. It is seen as instrumental for understanding and displaying the lives of Puerto Rican migrants in the late 19th century and into the 1940s. The evolution of these communities over time is shown by the influx of more Puerto Ricans to the city.  Legacy  Bernardo Vega died in 1965, before his memoir was published. Twelve years later Memoirs of Bernardo Vega was published in Spanish and then translated to English in 1984. His work is considered to be an important piece for Puerto Rican literature because of its historical accounts.

It was written in the summer of 1985 (Schnittke's final work on it was on 11 July 1985, just ten days before he suffered his first stroke). Its dedicatee is viola player Yuri Bashmet, who gave the work its world premiere with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra conducted by Lukas Vis at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam on 9 January 1986. Structure and style The concerto is scored for solo viola and an orchestra of: 3 flutes (no. 2 doubling piccolo, no. 3 doubling alto flute), 3 oboes (no. 3 doubling cor anglais), 3 clarinets in B (no. 2 doubling clarinet in E, no. 3 doubling bass clarinet), 3 bassoons (no. 3 doubling contrabassoon), 4 horns, 4 trumpets, 4 trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (2 players), harp, celesta, harpsichord, piano, and 8 each of violas, cellos and double basses. Note that violins are absent. The movements are as follows: #Largo #Allegro molto #Largo Depending on the precise tempi chosen a performance typically lasts between 35 and 40 minutes. Almost the entire structure of the concerto is based on a 6 note motif derived from the first 6 letters of the German spelling of Yuri Bashmet's surname (Baschmet). In German and French music letter notation the note names B‚ÄìA‚ÄìEs‚ÄìC‚ÄìH‚ÄìMi correspond to the notes B‚ÄìA‚Äì E‚ÄìC‚ÄìB()‚ÄìE() in the more familiar Anglo-Saxon notation. Each movement is longer than its predecessor, with the final movement being almost as long as the previous two together. The first commences with a declamation from the soloist, echoed by the orchestra, in which the \\"Bashmet motif\\" is first heard. This is followed by an extended version of the declamation culminating in a fortissimo chord from the orchestra. The movement closes with a delicate cadence. The second movement begins with frenetic arpeggios, including multiple double stopping, from the viola. During the movement Schnittke interweaves ideas from the first movement with an array of other musical references - dance-band music, film music, Soviet military marches - typical of Schnittke's brand of polystylism. Further iterations of the opening music lead to the viola's cadenza and, finally, a march-like theme which slowly fades out. The final movement returns to the slow tempo of the first. Its mood has been described as \\"bleak\\" and \\"funereal\\", the music formed of disjointed fragments from the first two movements. Schnittke himself commented on the music's structure as follows: DiscographyAlto - Yuri Bashmet, USSR Ministry of Culture Orchestra, Gennady Rozhdestvensky (conductor) *Ambroisie - Antoine Tamestit, Warsaw Philharmonic, Dmitrij Kitajenko (cond.) *BIS - Nobuko Imai, Malm√∂ Symphony Orchestra, Lev Markiz (cond.) *ECM - Kim Kashkashian, Bonn Beethovenhalle Orchestra, Dennis Russell Davies (cond.) *Ondine - David Aaron Carpenter, Philharmonia Orchestra, Christoph Eschenbach (cond.) *RCA - Yuri Bashmet, London Symphony Orchestra, Mstislav Rostropovich (cond.)

Typically, the entity thus introduced will serve as the topic of the subsequent discourse. For example, the construction with \\"there\\" in the following English sentence is a presentative: : _There_ appeared a cat on the window sill. In French, one of major uses of the words voici and voil√† is presentative, as in the following example: : However, the most common presentative in French is the (il) y a formula (from verb avoir ‚Äòhave‚Äô), as in the following sentence: : Similarly to French il y a, in Chinese the existential verb y«íu (have) is often used as a presentative to introduce new entities into discourse: : In Maybrat, a likely language isolate of West Papua, there is a dedicated presentative prefix me- which combines with demonstratives. It contrasts with other prefixes like pe- (forming adverbs, \\"there\\") or re- and we- (for attributives, \\"this man\\"). This contrast is illustrated in the following three examples with the demonstrative -to, which is used for non-masculine referents close to the speaker: The glosses here have been simplified. : : : Special word order configurations can also be used to introduce foregrounded entities into discourse, that is, to realise a presentational function.

In the following spoken Chinese sentence, the agent of the motion verb l√°i (come), which usually occupies the preverbal position, occurs after the verb because it denotes a discourse-new entity: : A subtype of inverted sentence is called locative inversion since in many languages the preverbal position is filled with a locative expression.

It expressed the viewpoint of Chinese nationalism and defended the interests of Chinese Indonesians and was for several decades one of the most widely read Malay newspapers in the Indies. It existed under various names until 1965. History The paper was founded in Batavia on October 1, 1910 after Lauw Giok Lan came up with the concept and approached Yoe Sin Gie. At first Lauw took on the editorial duties and Yoe took on the administrative aspects.Sin Po Jubileum Nummer 1910‚Äì1935 (Djakarta: Sin Po, 1935). The first director of the paper was Hauw Tek Kong. The paper quickly became very successful. Originally the paper had a European head editor, J. R. Razoux Kuhr, because the higher legal status of Europeans made this standard practice in Malay newspapers of the time.Sin Po Jubileum Nummer 1910‚Äì1935 (Djakarta: Sin Po, 1935). Only in 1916 did the paper decide to replace Razoux Kuth with a Chinese head editor, Kwee Hing Tjiat. By 1917 the paper took on an aggressively Chinese nationalist line. Although it was a paper run by Peranakan Chinese, it came to take a very pro-Peking and pro-Totok Chinese position, harshly criticizing the Chinese Officer system of Dutch indirect rule over the Indies Chinese.Seabad pers kebangsaan: 1907‚Äì2007. Agung Dwi Hartanto et al. I:BOEKOE, Yogyakarta, 2008. Historian Leo Suryadinata notes that Sin Po came to lead a distinct group at this time which he terms the Sin Po group. He states that this group believed in Peranakan-Totok unity, Chinese language education among Peranakan and non-participation in local Indies politics.Leo Suryadinata. Peranakan Chinese Politics in Java, 1917‚Äì1942. Singapore University Press, 1981. Front covers of the first and fourth issues of Sin Po, dating from October 1910 In 1922 Ang Jan Goan joined the editorial board of the newspaper. When Tjoe Bou San died in 1925, Kwee Kek Beng became editor-in-chief while Ang Jan Goan was promoted to be directorr, a position he stayed in until the end of the publication in 1959. By the second half of the 1920s, with the Indonesian nationalist movement gaining strength, Sin Po moderated its pro-China line and became more sympathetic to the Indonesian perspective. The group they represented also shifted in this direction as the editors of Djawa Tengah in Semarang become more Indies-oriented. Many of the Sin Po group who had advocated that Peranakan Chinese 'go back' to China for work and education gave up on this campaign. In the late 1930s Sin Po shifted its campaigning towards fundraising for China and spreading an anti-Japanese message among the Indies Chinese readership. The paper managed to raise 1.7 million guilders from 1937 to 1942 for the Chinese war effort against Japan. The paper continued after Indonesian independence and was forced to change its name in 1958 due to government regulations. It became Pantjawarta and then Warta Bhakti. In this era the paper took a pro-PKI line and was therefore banned in the crackdown after the September 30 Movement (G-30-S) in 1965. The comic Put On was serialized in this newspaper beginning in 1931; its author, Kho Wan Gie, began publishing his comics in it the previous year.

King of Sumer and Akkad (Sumerian: lugal-ki-en-gi-ki-uri, Akkadian: ≈°ar mƒÅt ≈†umeri u Akkadi) was a royal title in Ancient Mesopotamia combining the titles of \\"King of Akkad\\", the ruling title held by the monarchs of the Akkadian Empire (2334‚Äì2154 BC) with the title of \\"King of Sumer\\". The title simultaneously laid a claim on the legacy and glory of the ancient empire that had been founded by Sargon of Akkad (r. 2334‚Äì2279 BC) and expressed a claim to rule the entirety of lower Mesopotamia (composed of the regions of Sumer in the south and Akkad in the north). Despite both of the titles \\"King of Sumer\\" and \\"King of Akkad\\" having been used by the Akkadian kings, the title was not introduced in its combined form until the reign of the Neo-Sumerian king Ur- Nammu ( 2112‚Äì2095 BC), who created it in an effort to unify the southern and northern parts of lower Mesopotamia under his rule. The older Akkadian kings themselves might have been against linking Sumer and Akkad in such a way. In later centuries of Mesopotamian history, when the major kingdoms were Assyria and Babylon, the title was mostly used by monarchs of Babylon since they ruled lower Mesopotamia. For Assyrian kings, the title became a formal assertion of authority over the city of Babylon and its surroundings; only those Assyrian rulers who actually controlled Babylon used the title and when Assyria permanently lost control of Babylon to the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the rulers of that empire began using it instead. The final king to claim to be the King of Sumer and Akkad was Cyrus the Great (r. 559‚Äì530 BC) of the Achaemenid Empire, who assumed several traditional Mesopotamian titles after his conquest of Babylon in 539 BC.  History  = Background (2334‚Äì2112 BC) = The Akkadian Empire at its height under Naram-Sin (r. 2254‚Äì2218 BC). In the 24th/23rd century BC, Sargon of Akkad established the earliest known great Mesopotamian empire, known as the Akkadian Empire after its capital Akkad. Though his empire stretched far and wide, one of its most important regions was Sumer, the southern parts of lower Mesopotamia, where city states had competed with each other for universal rule for centuries. As such, the royal titles used by Sargon and his Akkadian successors were King of Akkad (Akkadian: ≈°ar mƒÅt Akkadi) and King of Sumer (Akkadian: ≈°ar mƒÅt ≈†umeri). The Akkadian kings also introduced some additional honorary royal titles, including Sargon's \\"King of the Universe\\" (≈°ar ki≈°≈°atim) and Naram-Sin's (Sargon's grandson) \\"King of the Four Corners of the World\\" (≈°ar kibrƒÅt erbetti). The political union of Sumer and Akkad under the Akkadian Empire, the largest empire that the world had yet seen, was seen as a monumentous event even in contemporary times, with both Sargon and Naram-Sin soon becoming legendary figures who would frequently appear in later Mesopotamian discussions on history. During the reign of Naram-Sin's son Shar-Kali-Sharri (r. 2217‚Äì2193 BC) the Akkadian Empire began to collapse as a result of widespread drought and an invasion by the nomadic Gutians.' In the 2100s BC, the Gutians destroyed the city of Akkad and supplanted the ruling Sargonic dynasty with their own line of kings of Sumer. The so-called Gutian dynasty did not last long, having been completely driven out by 2112 BC, replaced as the overall rulers of Sumer by the kings of Ur, which founded a new period of Sumerian civilization referred to as the Third Dynasty of Ur or the Neo- Sumerian Empire. = Creation of the title (2112‚Äì1717 BC) = Depiction of an enthroned Ur-Nammu of Ur (r. 2112‚Äì2095 BC) from one of his cylindrical seals. Ur-Nammu introduced the title of King of Sumer and Akkad to assert his rule over the entirety of lower Mesopotamia. The founder of the Third Dynasty of Ur, king Ur-Nammu (r. 2112‚Äì2095 BC) combined the old Akkadian royal titles \\"King of Akkad\\" and \\"King of Sumer\\" to create the combined title of \\"King of Sumer and Akkad\\" (Akkadian: ≈°ar mƒÅt ≈†umeri u Akkadi) in an effort to unify the southern and northern parts of lower Mesopotamia under his rule (in his time, \\"Akkad\\" would have been associated with the north rather than just the ruined city) and proclaim the reunification of Sumer and Akkad. Though both of the titles that formed the combined title had been used by the Akkadian kings, the double title was new. Some scholars suggest that Sargon of Akkad had during his reign explicitly been against linking Sumer and Akkad in such a fashion. There was some precedence in Mesopotamia for double titles of this kind. In the late Early Dynastic III period, double titles were sometimes used to express control over all of Sumer, the titles usually include or allude to the cities of Uruk and Ur. At this time, special titles, such as the attested \\"Lord of Sumer and King of the nation\\", were usually unique to a single ruler and in most cases, the word \\"king\\" (or an equivalent) was repeated, such as in the attested \\"King of Uruk and King of Ur\\", used by kings Lugalkiginedudu and Lugalkisalsi (both 2400 BC). Before the creation of titles like King of Sumer, King of Sumer and Akkad and more boastful honoraries like King of the Four Corners of the World and King of the Universe, there were no titles designating a regional ruler and specifying him as more powerful than the ruler of just a city, most titles following the format of \\"\\"King of\\" + city name\\". Ur-Nammu might rather have borrowed the idea of the combined title from the Hurrian king Atal-shen, who would have ruled in the land of Subartu in the decades immediately preceding Ur-Nammu's own reign. Atal-shen's title was \\"King of Urkis and Nawar\\", a title which combines the names of two cities distant from each other to claim rule over the entire land in between (e.g. Subartu). Ur-Nammu was acknowledged by the priesthood at Nippur, a religiously important city, with the title \\"King of Sumer and Akkad\\" and crowned as sovereign of the two lands surrounding Nippur \\"to right and left\\". Though the title is only well-attested for Ur-Nammu and his son Shulgi (r. 2094‚Äì2047 BC), it was the primary royal title of the Third Dynasty of Ur, alongside that of \\"King of Ur\\". The title continued to act as an important royal title throughout the rule of the succeeding Dynasty of Isin ( 1953‚Äì1717 BC), many of its rulers using the title, after the collapse of the Third Dynasty of Ur. It is possible that its continued use was because of the northern Akkad region of Mesopotamia gaining some sort of socioeconomic advantage over the southern region of Sumer. = Babylonian and Assyrian kings (1728‚Äì539 BC) = Tiglath- Pileser III (r. 745‚Äì727 BC) on a stela from the walls of his palace (now in the British Museum, London). Tiglath-Pileser was the first Assyrian king in centuries (except for a claim by Shamshi-Adad V) to use the title of King of Sumer and Akkad following his conquest of Babylon. Nabonidus of Babylon (r. 556‚Äì539 BC) shown praying to the moon, sun and Venus (British Museum). Nabonidus was one of the last rulers to use the title King of Sumer and Akkad. After the collapse of the Dynasty of Isin, the king Rim-Sin of Larsa (r. 1758‚Äì1699 BC) claimed its legacy but he was soon defeated by Hammurabi of Babylon (r. 1728‚Äì1686 BC) who conquered the considerable kingdom that Rim-Sin ruled (which included prominent cities like Uruk and the previous capital Isin). Through either outright conquest or forcing other states to pay tribute, Hammurabi extended Babylonian rule throughout Mesopotamia and while his early reign may be characterizable as a dual monarchy of sorts, ruling both Sumer and Akkad as more or less separate entities, his conquests to the northeast and north saw the formation of a true empire, which would not stay intact under his successors. As part in the formation of his empire, Hammurabi took the traditional ruling title of King of Sumer and Akkad, which after his reign appears sporadically in the titularies of Babylonian kings up until the eighth-century BC. Apart from the Babylonian kings, those Assyrian rulers who succeeding in conquering and controlling Babylon and Sumer also used the title of King of Sumer and Akkad. The earliest Assyrian king to succeed in this was the Middle Assyrian Tukulti-Ninurta I (r. 1244‚Äì1208 BC). After his reign, Babylon swiftly regained independence and as such the title would not be used by an Assyrian ruler for five hundred years (except for being claimed by Shamshi-Adad V, 824‚Äì811 BC, who did not actually control Babylon) until Babylon was reconquered under Tiglath-Pileser III (r. 745‚Äì727 BC). After Tiglath-Pileser III's reign, Babylon rebelled again and his son Sargon II (r. 722‚Äì705 BC) was also forced to reconquer it once more, only using the title upon his victory. For unknown reasons Sargon II's heir Sennacherib discarded the title but it was in turn reintroduced by Sennacherib's heir Esarhaddon. In the light of the Neo-Assyrian Empire's southern conquests, southern titles and epithets, including King of Sumer and Akkad, would have been important in order to assert control. The title allowed the Assyrian king to align himself with both the Akkadian and the Sumerian cultures. With \\"Sumer\\" referring to the coastal regions of southern Mesopotamia and Akkad the northern parts of the south, the title claimed control over all of lower Mesopotamia. To the Assyrians, the title was not only a claim to the prestige and legacy of Sargon of Akkad and the Akkadian Empire but also a formal assertion of sovereignty over Babylon. After the Neo-Assyrian Empire lost control over Babylon for good with the founding of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the Assyrian kings ceased to use the title. \\"King of Sumer and Akkad\\" was instead adopted by the first Neo- Babylonian king, Nabopolassar (r. 626‚Äì605 BC) The title continued to be used by the monarchs of the Neo-Babylonian Empire until its fall. = Cyrus the Great (539 BC) = In 539 BC, Cyrus the Great, founder of the Achaemenid Empire, conquered the city of Babylon and formally ended the Neo-Babylonian Empire. As part of his conquest, Cyrus created a foundation deposit to be buried in the walls of Babylon, now known as the Cyrus Cylinder, with text written in Akkadian cuneiform script. In the text of the cylinder, Cyrus assumes several traditional Mesopotamian titles including those of \\"King of Babylon\\", \\"King of Sumer and Akkad\\" and \\"King of the Four Corners of the World\\". Most of the Mesopotamian titles adopted by Cyrus, except for the one of \\"King of Babylon\\", were not used beyond his own reign, but other similar Mesopotamian titles continued to be adopted. The popular regnal title \\"King of Kings\\" (rendered ≈°ar ≈°arrƒÅni in Akkadian), used by monarchs of Iran until the modern age, was originally a title introduced by the Assyrian Tukulti-Ninurta I in the 13th century BC, the same Assyrian king that had first conquered Babylon. The title of \\"King of Lands\\", also used by Assyrian monarchs since at least Shalmaneser III (r. 859‚Äì824 BC), was also adopted by Cyrus the Great and his successors.

It was acquired by Adam Gottlob Moltke in 1746 and has remained in the hands of the Moltke family to the present day. It was part of the Countship of Bregentved from 1756 to 1920 and still shares its ownership with the Bregentved estate. The current Rococo-style main building was constructed by royal architect Niels Eigtved in 1750. It was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. History =Early history= Turebyholm was originally located in the no longer existing village of Tureby. In the Middle Ages it belonged to the episcopal see of Roskilde. The earliest known lensmann was Jens Jensen, who is mentioned in 1375. Mads Eriksen B√∏lle was in 1505 granted Turebyholm for life for himself, his wife and his son. B√∏lle was opposed to Christian III and the introduction of Protestantism but was nonetheless allowed to keep his fief after the Crown confiscated all church land after the Reformation. =G√∏ye family= Henrik G√∏ye, who owned Turebyholm in 1604-1611 Turebyholm was in 1604 acquired by Henrik G√∏ye in exchange for other property. The fief also comprised four farms and 12 houses in the village and around a hundred copyholds scattered across a large area. Turebyholm was in the same time granted the status of birk.G√∏ye dissolved the remaining four farms in Tureby and placed the land directly under the manor. Margrethe Brahe Henrik G√∏ye was married to Margrethe Brahe. She kept his estate after his death in 1611. After her own death in 1619, Turebyholm was passed on to two of their sons. They had been brought up by Holger Rosenkrantz, Birgitte Brahe's brother-in-law, after their father's death. Otto G√∏ye bought his brother Eskild's share of the estate in 1631. Otto G√∏ye was married to the learned Birgitte Thott. After Otto G√∏ye's death in 1642, Turebyholm was inherited by his brother, Eskild, but he allowed Birgitte Thott to stay on the estate. She made several of her translations while she lived at Turebyholm. Thott led a quiet life at Turebyholm but had to flee to Sor√∏9 when Swedish troops ravaged and looted on Zealand during the Second Northern War. =Reedtz and Thott families= Peder Reedtz In 1667, Turebyholm was acquired by Peder Reedtz, the owner of the owner of Tygestrup, Mindstrup and Palsgaard. He expanded the manor with more land. Redtz left Turebyholm heavily in debts to his widow, Anne Ramel, who managed to keep it until her death. The estate was then passed on to their daughter, Sophie Reedtz, who was married to Tage Thott. Thott was a Scanian nobleman who had fled to Denmark after the war. Sophie Reedtz kept the estate after her husband's death in 1707. In 1720, she sold it to the crown. The estate was then included in one of the 12 cavalry districts. The main building was used as military barracks and the fields were used for grazing. =Moltke family= Turebyholm in c. 17701 In 1747, Turebyholm was sold. In 1750, when Moltke was created count, Turebyholm formed part of the new countship of Bregentved. The old main building was adapted into a pleasure pavilion which was used when the king visited him on the estate. Turebyholm was part of the countship of Bregentved until its dissolution in 1920. It was then used as a farm under Bregentved manor. Architecture The main building consists of one story over a high cellar. Both sides of the building feature a median risalit tipped by a triangular pediment with sandstone ornamentation. The roof is a hipped, black-glazed tile roof with four chimneys. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. It underwent a comprehensive refurbishment in the 1990s and 2000s received an award from Eiropa Nostra. In a small grove to the north of the main building is a small underground ice house topped by a pavilion. It dates from the 18th century and is also listed.

She is a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania State Senate, representing the 38th district. Education Williams earned a BA in political science from Dickinson College and a JD from Duquesne University School of Law.  Career  Williams worked as director of advocacy for the National Whistleblower Center, but was laid off in 2012 after attempting to unionize the small workforce. She was offered a severance package but rejected it because of a confidentiality clause that would have prevented her from discussing her experiences. She appealed to the National Labor Relations Board, and eventually settled the case with her former employer. In 2014, Williams became communications director for the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers. She also previously worked for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. In 2018, Williams ran against Republican nominee Jeremy Shaffer in the general election, after Shaffer had defeated incumbent Randy Vulakovich in the Republican primary. The race was heavily watched, and Williams received an endorsement from former U.S. President Barack Obama. Both campaigns raised substantial amounts of funding‚ÄîWilliams raised over $700,000 and Shaffer raised over $1 million, including contributing $400,000 of his own money by the start of October and another $100,000 by the end of the month. Williams also campaigned and shared resources with other local female candidates, including Sara Innamorato. She narrowly defeated Shaffer (50.1% to 49.7%) in the election. Weeks before the election, Republicans in the state claimed Williams did not meet the constitutional residency requirement and attempted to remove her name from the ballot. They contended that since she voted in Maryland in the 2014 general election, she had not been a resident of Pennsylvania for at least four years as required by the state constitution. However, the effort was rejected by a court. After she won the election, state Republicans renewed their opposition and challenged her ability to be seated in the legislature. After months of controversy, the Republican leadership in the Senate decided against preventing her inauguration based on the documents produced by Williams. She took the oath of office and was sworn in with other newly elected members on January 1, 2019.

Career In the mid-1970s, Sullivan met director Sam Raimi because his wife, Penny was attending Michigan State University as the same time as Raimi, along with actor Bruce Campbell, screenwriter Scott Spiegel, and producer Robert Tapert. Sullivan bonded with Raimi over their mutual interest in stop-motion animation, special effects, claymation, and puppetry in relation to filmmaking. He joined the crew of Raimi's 1978 short film Within the Woods as a special effects artist. He would later work on The Evil Dead, Raimi's feature-length remake of Within the Woods, as a special makeup effects artist, where he worked with such materials as foam latex and fake blood. For the latter, he used coffee as an added ingredient to the traditional fake blood formula of corn syrup and food coloring. Sullivan designed and illustrated The Book of the Dead and created the Kandarian Dagger. Tom Sullivan and Bart Pierce designed, co-animated the clay stop motion \\"meltdown\\" of the deadites at the film's finale. That took three months to film.

In addition, Atwood was a director of the Illinois Manufacturers' Association, and had served in the Illinois Chamber of Commerce and the Graduate School of Business at the University of Chicago. In 1971, Seth G. Atwood founded the Time Museum at the Clock Tower Resort in Rockford, Illinois, which later became one of the leading horological museums in the world with nearly 1,500 pieces of horological collection, including atomic clocks. The museum's notable collection included ancient Chinese sundials and water clocks, early pendulum clocks, a quarter-repeater by Thomas Tompion, Breguet Sympathique Clocks, and the Patek Philippe Henry Graves Supercomplication which currently holds the title of the most expensive watch ever sold at auction, fetching 24 million US dollars (23,237,000 CHF) in Geneva on November 11, 2014. However, the museum was shut down in 1999 and its collection was sent to auctions over the years.  Early life  Seth G. Atwood was born in Rockford, Illinois on June 2, 1917. He attended Carleton College, and graduated from Stanford University with a B.A. degree in 1938. He later studied at the University of Wisconsin for a year, and obtained an M.B.A. from Harvard University in 1940. From 1942-1946, he served as an officer in the United States Navy, achieving the rank of lieutenant commander. Seth G. Atwood later returned to Rockford and joined in the Atwood Vacuum Machine Company, which was founded by his father, Seth B. Atwood, and his uncle, James T. Atwood in 1909 specializing in manufacturing vacuum cleaners.  Family business  By 1920, the Atwood Vacuum Machine Company had already shifted its focus from manufacturing vacuum cleaners to door silencers for cars. Eventually, the company began to manufacture a complete line of automobile body hardware. Seth G. Atwood became the president of the Atwood Vacuum Machine Company in 1953 when his father became chairman of the board. In 1967, Seth G. Atwood became the chairman of the company, and under his leadership the company became the world's \\"largest independent manufacturer of internal auto body hardware\\" in 1968. In 1970, the company re-organized and established the Automotive and Contract Division and the Mobile Products Division, employing over 2,500 employees with five plants in Canada and the United States. In 1971, the annual sale of the company reached around US$50 million. In 1985, Atwood Vacuum Machine was sold to Anderson Industries in Rockford, Illinois; the annual sale of the company was US$138 million at the time of this acquisition. Seth G. Atwood also managed other businesses of his family involving banking, venture capital, hotels and real estate properties.  Timepiece collection  = Time Museum = In 1971, Seth G.

Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago kept and displayed a large portion of the original collection from the Time Museum until February 2004.alt=250x250px However, the museum was shut down in March 1999 when United Realty Corp., a company owned by Atwood family interests, sold the Clock Tower Resort to Regency Hotel Management. As a result, the majority of the museum's collection went to the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, and was on display from January 2001 to February 2004. In 2004, a campaign to raise US$35 million to buy the collection for Time Museum failed, and the collection was broken up with its timepieces sent to auctions. Over the years, hundreds of items from the museum's original collection went up for sale in Sotheby's auctions, and several pieces became the world's most expensive watches and clocks ever auctioned. These included the Patek Philippe Henry Graves Supercomplication and the Breguet Sympathique Clock No.128 & 5009 (Duc d'Orl√©ans Breguet Sympathique, owned by Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans), which was originally restored by English watchmaker George Daniels at the request of Seth G.

He later changed his surname to Daƒù.  Family and early life  He was born in Germany to a father of Turkish origin and a mother of Kurdish origin. After having finished primary school in Germany he studied at a private college in Izmir, Turkey. After studying in Izmir he came back to Germany and began to work and take additional courses in photography. As in 1994 with MED TV the first Kurdish satellite channel was founded, he was involved as a camera man and one of its few staff members.  Life with the PKK  In 1994 he and a cameraman travelled to Damascus, Syria to film an interview with Abdullah √ñcalan. He later declared that it was during this interview it became clear to him that he wanted to become a member of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The cameraman returned alone in May 1995. Dag was trained for 6 months in political ideology in a camp in Damascus. From late 1995 on, he was stationed mainly in Iraqi Kurdistan and active in the media unit of the PKK. He filmed and his reports were aired by MED TV. In 1997 a video of his, in which could be seen, how the PKK shot down a Turkish helicopter, was a major media event for militant Kurds. In this time he also wrote articles for several Kurdish news agencies. After the expulsion of Syria of the PKK and the capture of √ñcalan the movement had to adjust to the new circumstances. Therefore, the Sehit Sefkan Culture and Arts School was founded of which he became a member. He began filming movies. In his movies the actors were not professional actors but PKK fighters who often acted for the first time in a movie. In total he made 6 movies with durations between 29 minutes and 162 minutes.

Angels are portrayed as extremely powerful beings. Merely perceiving their true form - even psychically - typically results in blindness, as the appearance of their natural \\"visage\\" is overwhelming; it is capable of burning an individual's eyes from their sockets, although certain \\"special people\\" are able to withstand their true appearances and voices. Because their true appearances cannot be safely perceived by humans and because they are spirits with no physical being, they often take on humans as vessels in order to exist in and interact with the physical world, though only with the hosts' consent. Angels require a particular vessel to reach their full potential, people being \\"chosen\\" to be their hosts or \\"true vessels\\". Most angels are portrayed as emotionless authoritarian beings. A number have been shown to have disdain for humanity, whom they believe are flawed and inferior creations, though Lucifer is the only angel who refused to kneel before humans at God's command. All angels, fallen or not, consider themselves family, each being brothers and sisters and referring to God as their Father. However, most angels have not actually met or spoken to God. According to Anna Milton, only four angels have actually met God and seen his true face. This number later proves to be false, and six angels are said to have met him - Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Lucifer, Metatron and Gadreel. This increased to seven after Castiel meets him.The highest- ranking angels currently command the lesser-ranking, their former leader God having disappeared and left the angels to protect humanity in His place. Series creator Eric Kripke originally did not want angels to be featured in the series, believing God worked through hunters rather than angels. However, with so many demonic villains, he and the writers changed their minds when they realized that the show needed angels to create a \\"cosmic battle\\". As Kripke put it, \\"We had the empire, but we didn't really have the rebellion.\\" They had always wanted to have a storyline with a few central characters but having massive battles in the background, comparable to Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings, and the addition of angels allowed for this. Kripke has found that it has opened up many new storylines. List =Akobel= Akobel, portrayed by Nils Hognestad, is the Seraphim of the Sixth Choir who married a human, Lily Sunder, in the early twentieth century. In \\"Lily Sunder Has Some Regrets,\\" the Winchesters and Castiel investigate a series of angel murders committed by Lily Sunder. Castiel and Ishim, the last two angels left, explain that in 1901, Ishim's garrison, then including Castiel, was ordered to kill Akobel for fathering a Nephilim with Lily Sunder and kill the child, May. When confronted by the angels, Akobel ordered Lily to run and attempted to attack Ishim, but was prevented by Castiel. Restrained by Benjamin and Mirabel, Akobel was executed by Mirabel with an angel blade for his crime and May was then killed by Ishim. In the present day, Lily is seeking revenge upon the angels who killed her family. After tracking down Lily, the Winchesters learn the truth from her: Akobel was not May's father and she was in fact human. Akobel was protecting Lily's family from Ishim who had become obsessed with her. After she rejected him, Ishim murdered Lily's family in revenge and Lily spent the next century hunting down the angels responsible. During a battle, Ishim is killed by Castiel to save Lily, avenging the murders of Akobel and May. Despite Castiel saving her life, Lily is left unsure if she can forgive him for his role in the events and the remorseful Castiel promises that if she wants revenge again later, he'll be waiting for her. =Anael= Anael is an angel who is described as a low-level functionary portrayed by Danneel Ackles, the wife of Jensen Ackles, who plays Dean Winchester. Anael first appears in \\"Devil's Bargain\\" in the guise of her vessel Sister Jo, working as a faith healer. As a faith healer, Anael heals people of their various injuries and ailments in exchange for money. Anael is found by Lucifer who is seeking out angels to drain their grace in order to recharge his own. Recognizing the rogue archangel, Anael instead convinces Lucifer to take bits of her grace, allow her to recharge and then take some more. In this way, Lucifer recharges his grace and forms a relationship with Anael who reveals that she has many plans to remake Heaven for the better, but has never been taken seriously by the other angels. The Winchesters and Castiel eventually track down Anael and Lucifer through Sister Jo's credit cards and Anael pretends to comply with them, claiming that Lucifer is extremely weak. In their motel room, Anael aids Lucifer in fighting the Winchesters and Castiel, flinging Sam into a wall. Before Lucifer can kill them, Arthur Ketch appears and throws a demon bomb, causing Lucifer to grab Anael and teleport away. At Anael's suggestion, Lucifer next visits the Heavenly Portal where he promises to restore the angels' wings and help make new angels if they will bow to him as their undisputed leader. Anael later stands by Lucifer's side as the angels all bow to him in Heaven's Throne Room. Anael appears in \\"Bring 'em Back Alive\\" as Lucifer's second-in-command, growing increasingly frustrated with Lucifer's antics. Lucifer eventually admits to Anael that he lied about being able to restore the angels' wings and make new angels and violently lashes out at her, but can't bring himself to kill Anael. Completely fed up, Anael tells Lucifer that he now has nothing and has lost her too before leaving him alone. Lucifer subsequently abandons Heaven and Anael who is revealed in \\"Funeralia\\" to be one of less than a dozen angels left alive in all of creation. In season 14's \\"Stranger in a Strange Land,\\" Anael, working again as a faith healer on Earth, is approached by the alternate Michael in his search for answers. She later calls Sam to warn him of Michael working with monsters. In \\"Game Night,\\" Castiel seeks Anael's help in finding a way to contact God as she was once the prot√©g√© of Joshua. Anael reveals a rumor that Joshua managed to contact God after the Fall and helps Castiel search for the method Joshua used. Anael recognizes that Castiel is really trying to find a way to restore Jack's lost soul before he has to tell Sam and Dean about it and explains her reasons for leaving Joshua for her role as a low-level functionary. Though the two angels succeed in finding the copy of Dean's amulet that Joshua constructed, they receive no reply from God and go their separate ways with Castiel planning to finally tell Sam and Dean the truth. In season 15's \\"Destiny's Child,\\" the Winchesters, Castiel and Jack are instructed by Billie to find a mystical object called the Occultum which they track to Anael. Anael reveals that she gave the Occultum to Ruby, supposedly so that the demon could sell it for millions of dollars. However, Dean killed Ruby before she could sell the Occultum and it is currently hidden in Hell. When the Winchesters search Hell, they are ambushed by three demons, but defeat them. Before being killed, the lead demon reveals that Anael hired them to kill Sam and Dean, promising to help the demons escape Hell in exchange. Abandoning her life as a faith healer, Anael flees, telling a man seeking her services to never help your friends if they ask too much of you. Castiel subsequently enters the Empty to talk to Ruby who reveals that Anael approached her, suggesting that they ride out the Apocalypse inside of the Occultum, the safest place there is. Ruby never told Anael where she hid the Occultum on Earth as she didn't trust the angel and reveals where to look in exchange for Castiel promising to try to get the demon out of the Empty. =Anna Milton= =Balthazar= Balthazar, portrayed by Sebastian Roch√©, is an angel who had fought alongside Castiel during the last angelic war. Believed dead, this was merely a cover as he left Heaven, taking a number of the weapons with him. Since faking his own death, he has been on Earth enjoying a rather hedonistic lifestyle. In \\"The Third Man\\", the Winchesters discover that three corrupt cops were murdered by the young brother of one of their victims in possession of The Staff of Moses. Balthazar is revealed to have sold it to the boy in return for his soul. During a conflict with Raphael and his henchmen, Balthazar destroys the archangel's vessel with Lot's Salt. Dean then traps Balthazar in a ring of Holy Fire and forces him to give up the boy's soul. They want to get more from him, but Castiel releases him because he owes him his life. Sam uses an Enochian ritual to summon Balthazar, in \\"Appointment in Samarra\\". Sam asks him if there is any way to keep a soul out of its body. Balthazar informs him of a ritual that involves him defiling his vessel, his reason for helping Sam being that he would find it useful to have Sam in his debt. He tells Sam that he would need the blood of his father (that needn't come from the \\"father of your blood\\"), prompting Sam to try to kill Bobby before he is subdued, Dean and Death managing to recover Sam's soul. Balthazar transports Sam and Dean to an alternate universe, in \\"The French Mistake\\", to evade the angelic hit man Virgil and gives them a key which he claims opens where the weapons he stole from Heaven are stored. This is revealed to have been a ploy by Balthazar and Castiel to allow the latter to retrieve the weapons from their true location while Raphael was distracted. A suspicious alias used by Balthazar in 1912 leads to the brothers summoning Balthazar in \\"My Heart Will Go On\\". Balthazar claims he had saved the Titanic simply because he detested the movie and subsequent eponymous song. However, upon confrontation with Fate, Atropos reveals she knows Balthazar is working for Castiel; the saving of the Titanic was to provide additional souls to fund their side in the civil war. Castiel pulls out of the plan to kill Atropos once she threatens the Winchesters, stopping Balthazar from killing her. When the Winchesters reveal that Castiel is in league with Crowley, in \\"Let It Bleed\\", Balthazar agrees to assist the brothers and act as a double agent. He then transports Sam and Dean to where Lisa and Ben are being held captive. In \\"The Man Who Knew too Much\\", Balthazar begins to have second thoughts about betraying Castiel, but ultimately continues to assist the brothers. He informs Dean and Bobby of where the ritual to open the gate to Purgatory will take place. Castiel summons Balthazar and reveals that he is aware of his actions, Balthazar is then killed by Castiel. In season 13's \\"Unfinished Business\\", an alternate reality version of Balthazar is mentioned to have led one of the Apocalypse World Michael's armies. He was killed in battle by Lucifer's son Jack. =Bartholomew= An angel portrayed by Adam J. Harrington who after the fall of the angels began gathering other angels into a faction to retake and rule Heaven. Bartholomew is described as being a protege of Naomi and in \\"I'm No Angel\\", uses Internet preacher Reverend Buddy Boyle to find vessels for other angels. Wanting revenge for the expulsion of the angels, Bartholomew sends his followers after Castiel and when he wards himself against angelic detection, rogue Reapers. In \\"Holy Terror\\", Bartholomew has shifted to using Buddy Boyle to target select groups rather than the whole world so he can control who will become a vessel, wanting only his followers to gain vessels. After some of Bartholomew's angels are slaughtered by angels under the command of anarchist Malachi, Bartholomew refuses a meeting with him and starts an angelic civil war between his and Malachi's factions. In Captives, Bartholomew has begun destroying all other factions, including peaceful ones as he sees them threats to his power and his men capture Castiel. Bartholomew is pleased by this, having apparently put aside his previous resentment as he is an old friend and ally of Castiel. Bartholomew invites Castiel to join him, having turned all of his human followers into vessels and using their resources to track Metatron when he appears on Earth. Bartholomew believes with Castiel on his side he can unite all of the angels under his command and retake Heaven, but Castiel refuses to help when he tortures an innocent angel. When Castiel refuses to kill the angel, Bartholomew attacks him, but Castiel overpowers him. Though Castiel has Bartholomew at his mercy, he refuses to kill him as he wants no more angel deaths and lets him go. Bartholomew refuses to stop however and draws a second angel sword and attacks Castiel while his back is turned. With no other choice, Castiel kills Bartholomew in self-defense with his own sword. Afterwards, several of his followers decide to follow Castiel, having seen a different way in Castiel's refusal to kill him and desire for no more bloodshed. =Billie= Introduced in season 11, Billie, portrayed by Lisa Berry, is a reaper first appearing in \\"Form and Void.\\" She meets Sam inside a hospital whose inhabitants are dying due to the Darkness' infection, with her acting as their reaper. Despite Dean having killed Death in the previous season, souls are still required to be collected. Billie tells Sam that she is tired of seeing him and Dean dying and coming back over and over again, promising them that the next time they die, she will put them into the Empty, where no soul can ever escape. Billie senses that Sam is \\"unclean in the Biblical sense\\" and believes that she will be reaping him soon. Though Sam comes close to succumbing to his Rabid infection, he remembers Billie's comment about being \\"unclean in the Biblical sense\\" and discovers a cure through holy fire after looking up Biblical purifications. In \\"The Devil in the Details,\\" Billie returns guarding a door into Hell for Crowley, stating that its useful for her to have the King of Hell owe her one in such troubled times. When Dean arrives, Billie lets him in before revealing her identity to him. Billie makes it clear that while she doesn't actually want to kill the Winchesters, she just intends to make sure they remain dead when they do die. Billie gives a Dean a witchcatcher she has located for Crowley and later lets Castiel through the door when he is unexpectedly teleported into the room. In \\"Red Meat,\\" a desperate Dean decides to contact Billie to make a deal after Sam's apparent death. Dean commits suicide through a drug overdose of prescription pills. As a doctor desperately tries to revive Dean, Billie arrives and freezes time to \\"savor the moment.\\" Though Dean tries to bargain with Billie, she refuses to deal, intent on taking him to the Empty. Though Dean insists that Sam is the only one who can beat the Darkness, Billie expresses disbelief at the idea and tells Dean that even if Sam could defeat the Darkness, she wouldn't bring him back and that \\"the answer will always be no.\\" Billie then tells the shocked Dean that Sam's not actually dead as she would've been told if Sam had died. Billie unfreezes time and prepares to take Dean to the Empty, but the doctor is able to revive Dean with a shot of adrenaline to the heart. Disappointed, Billie departs alone. In \\"Alpha and Omega,\\" Billie witnesses the Winchesters collecting ghosts at Waverly Hills Sanatorium and follows them back to the Men of Letters bunker where she senses that God is dying. After the Winchesters, Castiel, Crowley and God explain their plan to her, Billie agrees to help, stating \\"little tip‚Äîyou want souls, call a reaper.\\" Billie is able to draw a couple of hundred thousand souls from the Veil into the crystal for the Winchesters' Soul Bomb, giving them the means to potentially kill the Darkness. Billie departs after saying goodbye to Crowley and tells Dean that while they will see her again, she hopes it is not today. In season 12's \\"Celebrating the Life of Asa Fox,\\" Billie returns to reap the souls of those killed by the demon Jael, warning Dean, who is trapped outside of the house, of the threat. Dean begs Billie to help him get back in, promising that he owes her one in exchange. Billie agrees and throws Dean straight through the door to the house. After Jael is exorcised, Billie reappears to claim the one that Dean owes her: the recently resurrected Mary Winchester. Billie recognizes that Mary is struggling to deal with her return and offers her peace. Mary confirms that Billie can't kill Mary herself due to the rules and ultimately chooses to stay rather than leave her sons again. Billie leaves Mary be and tells all of the Winchesters that if they ever want peace, all they have to do is call for her. In \\"First Blood,\\" Billie reappears at midnight after the Winchesters escape Site 94. Sam and Dean reveal that they were going insane while in captivity so they summoned Billie and made a deal with her: in exchange for Billie temporarily killing them and then later reviving them so that they could escape, one Winchester would die permanently at midnight. Billie made the Winchesters seal the deal in blood and warns that breaking such a deal could have cosmic consequences. As Mary is a Winchester, she decides to sacrifice herself rather than force one of her sons to die and Billie keeps Sam and Dean from interfering. Before Mary can commit suicide, Billie is killed from behind by Castiel with an angel blade to the Winchesters' shock. Castiel expresses a belief that the world can't afford to lose even one of the family and he was acting in their best interests by killing Billie to break the deal. As a result, Dean is pissed with Castiel through \\"Lily Sunder Has Some Regrets,\\" eventually admitting that he is worried about Billie's warning of cosmic consequences for breaking the deal. In season 13's \\"Advanced Thanatology,\\" Billie unexpectedly returns after Dean briefly commits suicide to learn the location of the remains of a group of ghosts. When Sam can't revive Dean, Billie appears and stops time. Billie reveals to Dean that one of the rules of the Universe is that when one incarnation of Death is killed, the next Reaper to die will take his place. As a result, Billie has been resurrected as the new Death with a new outfit and a ring and scythe like the old Death. Billie transports Dean to her office in the Veil and asks him about the rift that had opened briefly to another universe. Dean agrees to tell Billie what she wants to know if she will free the trapped ghosts, a deal Billie accepts and sends the Reaper Jessica to complete. Dean explains the circumstances behind the rift and Billie shows him her library displaying all the possible methods of death for a person. With a new outlook on life and death, Billie soon recognizes how much Dean has changed from his selfless deal and that he actually wants to die. Rather than taking him to the Empty, an amused Billie tells Dean to keep living and personally resurrects Dean. After his return to life, Dean tells Sam about his encounter with Billie as Death. In \\"Funeralia,\\" the witch Rowena begins killing people before their time and the Reapers sent to collect their souls in order to attract Billie's attention and force her to resurrect Crowley. In response, Billie has the Reaper Jessica, who she has had following the Winchesters around, alert them to the threat. However, Jessica is unable to intervene directly due to Billie's rules and can't offer more than information. Jessica also passes along a message from Billie that all versions of Rowena's final death have her killed by Sam. After Rowena begins torturing Sam, Billie appears in person and refuses to bow to Rowena's blackmail. Billie easily withstands Rowena's magical barrage and offers sympathy to Rowena who she recognizes has changed, but continues to refuse to bring back Crowley. Before departing, Billie promises Dean to \\"see you soon\\" and Rowena's magical attack on Billie is revealed to have exhausted her enhanced powers, possibly to the point that they will never recover. In season 14's \\"Nihilism,\\" Sam attempts to get the Reaper Violet to transport himself, Castiel, Jack and Michael to safety with Violet refusing because of Billie's rules before they are unexpectedly teleported to the Bunker. After Michael is locked away in Dean's mind, he is visited by Billie who he realizes was the one to save them despite it breaking the rules. Billie admits that she \\"took a gamble\\" by helping them and reminds Dean of the time he visited her reading room which showed the many ways he could die. Billie reveals that every single version of his fate but one now has Michael breaking free and using Dean's body to destroy the world and chides Dean for his universe hopping. Billie hands Dean the book containing the one fate that has Michael losing, leaving Dean in shock over what it reveals. Billie tells Dean that it Is up to him to decide what to do with the information and disappears, leaving Dean with the book. In \\"Damaged Goods,\\" Dean tells Sam that Billie revealed to him that the only way to stop Michael is for Dean to build a Ma'lak Box and trap himself and Michael for eternity. To this end, Billie has provided Dean with the instructions to build the box. In \\"Moriah,\\" after God kills Jack and begins the end of the world, Billie appears in the Empty with Jack and the Shadow. As Jack asks what's happening, Billie tells Jack that they need to talk about that. In season 15's \\"The Trap,\\" Billie visits the still-awake Jack in the Empty after the Winchesters choose not to seal God away after learning of the consequences to the world. Billie tells the young Nephilim that \\"it's time.\\" In \\"The Gamblers,\\" Billie is revealed to have resurrected Jack and is guiding him in targeting Grigori, fallen angels that feed on the souls of innocent people. Jack later explains that Billie had kept him hidden in the Empty until God left the Earth at which point it was safe for Jack to be resurrected. Billie has provided Jack with a plan that will allow Jack to become strong enough to kill God himself. In \\"Galaxy Brain,\\" Billie is revealed to have been unable to restore Jack's soul when she resurrected him, leaving Jack soulless again. She ignores Jack's prayers, instead assigning a Reaper named Merle to watch over Jack and control him. After Jack opens a rift to the Bad Place against her explicit instructions, Billie kills Merle and explains that God has been destroying all of the alternate universes and states that even God has a book detailing his ultimate fate in her library. Billie states that Jack, Sam and Dean are in the book which God can't access without her permission, but refuses to explain further beyond Sam and Dean's destiny being to be the messengers of God's destruction. In \\"Destiny's Child,\\" Billie reveals that God is almost done destroying other universes and will soon turn his attention back to their world. Billie assigns Jack another quest, this time one of a more spiritual nature than the first quest which was aimed at strengthening Jack's body. Billie instructs the Winchesters, Jack and Castiel to find the Occultum, though she refuses to explain what it will do and doesn't know where to find it. When Castiel later enters the Empty to talk to Ruby, the Occultum's last owner, its revealed that Billie and the Shadow are working together and as a result, it allowed Billie to resurrect Jack. Billie has promised the entity that once everything is over, she will send it back to sleep, something that it desperately wants, surprising Castiel that Billie can do that. However, while torturing Castiel, the Shadow comments that Billie never mentioned needing Castiel for her plan. Jack ultimately fulfills his quest, resulting in the Occultum restoring Jack's lost soul. =Castiel= =Dumah= Dumah is an angel portrayed by Erica Cerra who is one of the very few angels left alive by season 13 and appears to hold a position of power amongst the remaining few. Dumah first appears in \\"War of the Worlds\\" as Castiel's contact in Heaven who he meets with about the disappearance of Jack, Lucifer's Nephilim son. Dumah assures Castiel that Jack is not in the angels custody and reveals that they want Jack because they see him as their only chance to make new angels. Dumah tells Castiel that the angels are in danger of going extinct and are willing to go to any measures to survive, including enslaving Jack to make new angels. Dumah brings in two other angels to ambush Castiel who fights back. The brief skirmish is interrupted by the surprise appearance of Lucifer who scares off Dumah and the other two angels. In \\"Devil's Bargain,\\" Lucifer and Anael meet with Dumah and several other angels outside of the Heavenly Portal. Lucifer promises that if the angels bow to him as their leader, he can restore their wings and make new angels for them, claiming to know how as he witnessed God making the angels in the first place. Dumah and all of the angels later bow to Lucifer in Heaven's Throne Room. Dumah subsequently appears in \\"Bring 'em Back Alive\\" and is ordered by Lucifer to dispatch angels to find his son. After a brief hesitation, she agrees. In \\"Funeralia,\\" Castiel returns to a Heaven experiencing power fluctuations. He is finally met by Dumah and a few other angels and requests their help, telling them about the fact that Gabriel is still alive, the upcoming invasion by an alternate Michael, the trapped Jack and the danger of Lucifer. As the power fluctuates around them, Dumah tells Castiel that they might be able to help each other, orders him to wait in the throne room and disappears for a while. When she returns, Dumah tells Castiel that if he can find Gabriel and bring him back to Heaven, the angels can help him with everything else such as finding Michael and defending Earth. When Castiel tells her that he can't find them which is why he needs her help, Dumah admits that that is a problem. Castiel asks why Dumah can't just send a few angels to search for Gabriel before Naomi appears and tells him that Dumah won't help him because she and the angels can't. Naomi subsequently explains that there are now less than a dozen angels left alive which includes Castiel, Naomi and Dumah. The low number of angels is causing the power fluctuations in Heaven and if things don't change soon, the angels will burn out and Heaven will crumble. As a result, Naomi and Heaven's remaining angels can't leave Heaven without risking it crumbling. In \\"Byzantium,\\" Castiel finds that Heaven has been invaded by the Cosmic Entity in search of Jack's soul. Castiel encounters an unconscious Dumah who wakes up and joins Castiel on his mission to find and resurrect Jack. After Castiel finds Jack, Dumah is revealed to be possessed by the Entity who uses her form to attack Castiel and make a deal with him. When the Entity departs Heaven, it leaves Dumah's body, leaving her with apparently no memory of her possession. In \\"Absence,\\" Dumah appears when Castiel calls for Naomi after the death of Mary Winchester. Dumah will only tell him that Naomi is \\"indisposed,\\" but confirms that Mary Winchester is dead and at peace in Heaven. To prove it, Dumah allows Castiel into Heaven where he witnesses Mary at peace in a shared Heaven with John Winchester. In \\"Jack in the Box,\\" Castiel returns to Heaven to seek Naomi's help in finding Jack. Dumah reveals that she has overthrown Naomi, pointing out that the Entity invaded Heaven under Naomi's watch and nearly killed all of the angels. Though Dumah promises to help, she locates Jack and begins manipulating him for her own ends, creating a reign of terror wherein humans are beaten into submission, Heaven is stripped of all mercy and Jack acts to solidify Dumah's own power. Dumah defends her actions as being necessary to save Heaven, the angels and the world and states her intentions to guide Jack. When Castiel moves to take Jack and leave, Dumah stops him and threatens to use her new power over Heaven to end John and Mary's peaceful shared Heaven together with just a snap of her fingers. Enraged, Castiel instantly draws his angel blade and kills Dumah before she can react, leaving her body on the floor of Heaven as Castiel heads off after Jack. In \\"Moriah,\\" Jack recognizes that Dumah had been using him when talking with Castiel. =Gabriel= Gabriel (also referred to as the Trickster or Loki) is an archangel portrayed by Richard Speight, Jr. Having grown tired of watching his brothers fight each other in Heaven, he fled to Earth thousands of years prior to the series, assuming the role of a Pagan trickster. For his first appearance in the second-season episode \\"Tall Tales\\", the writers decided not to put their own spin on trickster lore as is usually done with other villains keeping the \\"deadly sense of humor\\" and decision to go after the \\"high and mighty to bring them down a notch\\",Knight, Nicholas, (Season 2 Companion), p.87 with Gabriel causing several violent urban legends to come to life on a college campus and punish those residing there. Sam and Dean Winchester investigate and eventually figure out his identity, though the Trickster is waiting for them and offers a peaceful resolution so long as they let him leave to terrorize another town. Sam and Dean refuse, and attack him with the help of fellow hunter Bobby Singer, and the Trickster fakes his own death. The Trickster reappears in the season 3 episode \\"Mystery Spot\\", trapping Sam in a time loop where Dean ends up dying in many different ways. After over a hundred loops, Sam threatens the Trickster with a blood-covered stake, after which he agrees to break the loop. But when Sam considers killing him regardless, the Trickster sends the two to the next day where Dean once again dies, but is unable to be resurrected due to there being no more time loop. Months later, he calls Sam to him, where he tries to drive in a point: the two brothers continually sacrificing themselves for one another would bring no good, and when people die, their survivors just have to learn to accept it and live with it. However the Trickster gives Sam what he wants, lamenting the whole situation had become boring months ago for him anyway. In the season 5 episode \\"Changing Channels\\", he lures the Winchesters to him with a case that makes it obvious he is involved. He traps Sam and Dean in an endless thread of television shows where they must play out their roles to survive, while ignoring their attempts at having him in them in the apocalypse. Gabriel also explains this was his way of getting them to consequently be willing to accept their roles as vessels for Lucifer and Michael respectively. In one of the scenarios, he banishes Castiel and is livid at a response about the Archangels. He is later stabbed with a stake, a move that would kill regular trickster spirits, however, he continues to put them in the shows. Dean and Sam trap him in a burning circle of holy oil, suspecting he is an angel because he survived the staking, how he and Castiel interacted, and his anger at the insults of the Archangels. He then reveals that he is the archangel Gabriel, which doesn't surprise them. He explains he left Heaven because of the conflict of his family, he even expresses his desire for the Winchesters to say yes to becoming Michael's and Lucifer's vessels since their lives mirror that of the angels. Dean forces him to bring Castiel back and frees Gabriel from his trap and accuses him of giving up because he's simply too afraid to stand up to his own family. Gabriel returns in \\"Hammer of the Gods\\", attending the summit of pagan gods under the guise of Loki; however, he intends to rescue the brothers as their plan to lure Lucifer would easily fail, and Lucifer would slaughter them all. As he intends to prevent Kali, an old flame, from suffering a bloody fate, he tries to get them out; but he tells them he cannot rescue the pagan's hostages as it would be too difficult. However, later he is forced to comply; the rescue attempt results in the brothers' capture once again. Kali (who is keeping the brothers from leaving as their spilled blood binds them to her) reveals she, along with the other gods, knew of his identity for a while. Kali takes his sword and stabs him with it apparently killing him, but Gabriel appears to Dean and reveals the sword was a fake and suggests Dean should seduce Kali so they can escape. Lucifer shows up at the hotel, slaughtering most of the gods. Gabriel is then forced to step in, allowing Kali and the brothers to leave. Gabriel confronts his brother about loyalties and their past, but ultimately fails and is killed by his own blade. He later reveals, through a modified porn movie, Lucifer can be recaptured in his previous prison, with the four rings of the Horsemen. Gabriel returns in the season 9 episode \\"Meta Fiction\\" where he reveals to Castiel that he has been in Heaven since he 'died'. However, when Heaven kicked all the angels out, Gabriel was forced to go on the run from Metatron. He tells Castiel that Metatron was using the Horn of Gabriel to trap and kill the angels and that he needs Castiel to help him fight. When the two are running, they stop at a gas station where they realize that some of Metatron's loyal subjects were following them. Gabriel offers to fight them off because he still has some of his Archangel mojo left but then Castiel realizes that the whole situation was an illusion. Castiel then asks if Gabriel is really still alive, but all Gabriel does for an answer is raise his eyebrows before disappearing. Metatron says later that Gabriel played out his part well. In \\"We Happy Few\\", God confirms that Gabriel is dead when they discuss how the four archangels were required to help God barely defeat the Darkness the first time. God tells the Winchesters that while they have Lucifer fighting with them, Michael is in no shape to fight and Raphael and Gabriel are dead. When Dean reminds God that he has resurrected Castiel before, God tells him that he can't resurrect the archangels so easily as they are beings of primordial creation. As a result, it will take far too much time to resurrect Gabriel and Raphael to help fight the Darkness. In the season 13 \\"Devil's Bargain\\", the Prince of Hell Asmodeus reveals to Arthur Ketch that he has gotten his hands on an Archangel Blade, the only known weapon that can kill an archangel. When Arthur reminds Asmodeus that the lore states that only an archangel can wield the blade, Asmodeus reveals that he has Gabriel, somehow still alive, as his prisoner. Gabriel is now in a beaten and bloody state with his mouth sewn shut. In \\"The Thing\\", Arthur discovers that Asmodeus is injecting himself with Gabriel's grace to power up. Following a brutal beating by Asmodeus, Arthur rescues Gabriel and steals the archangel blade and Asmodeus' store of Gabriel's grace. Arthur brings the traumatized Gabriel to the Winchesters who are shocked to see the archangel whom they believed to be dead and learn of his captivity. Using Gabriel's extracted grace, the Winchesters are able to complete a ritual to open a door into an alternate reality that Dean passes through, leaving Sam and Gabriel behind. In \\"Bring 'em Back Alive\\", Sam and Castiel attempt to treat the traumatized Gabriel who cringes away from all attempts to help him and appears unable to speak, even with the stitches holding his mouth shut cut. Gabriel eventually writes his story on the wall in Enochian, revealing that he actually faked his death during the Apocalypse by tricking Lucifer into stabbing another duplicate of himself. Free of responsibility, Gabriel returned to a life of personal enjoyment until he was captured and sold to Asmodeus. After a plea by Sam, Gabriel starts responding, but retreats into himself again after learning that Asmodeus knows where he is. When Asmodeus invades the bunker, Gabriel is recaptured, but snaps out of his traumatized state when Asmodeus starts torturing Sam and Castiel. Healing himself, Gabriel quickly kills Asmodeus, he is informed of the events that followed in his absence but refuses to help further and departs the bunker. With the departure of Gabriel and the use of the last of his stored grace in an effort to heal him, the Winchesters are left without a way to reopen the door to Apocalypse World. They are also left without a powerful ally who could've helped them fight Michael. During \\"Funeralia\\", Castiel visited Heaven and made the other angels aware of Gabriel still being alive, to their surprise. The angels tasked Castiel with retrieving Gabriel so that Heaven could properly fluctuate because of the low number of angels. In \\"Unfinished Business\\", Gabriel seeks revenge on the pagan gods Loki, Fenrir, Narfi and Sleipnir. It Is revealed that millennia before, Gabriel rescued Loki and made a deal with him where Gabriel took on Loki's form and persona as The Trickster to go into \\"witness protection.\\" Gabriel had sought out Loki's help after faking his death only to have Loki betray him and sell Gabriel to Asmodeus. Low on grace and wounded, Gabriel arms himself with specially-crafted wooden swords and seeks the help of the Winchesters after he is wounded and sense they were following him. In exchange for Gabriel helping them, the Winchesters agree to help Gabriel get revenge. With the help of the Winchesters, Gabriel kills Fenrir, Narfi and Slepnir before facing off with Loki (also played by Richard Speight, Jr.) who blames Gabriel for his father Odin's murder by Lucifer and wants revenge. Gabriel kills Loki and keeps his promise to return to the bunker with the Winchesters and joins their quest to stop Michael. In \\"Beat the Devil\\", Gabriel gives up some of his archangel grace to complete the spell to open up the rift to Apocalypse World, but the spell fails. Gabriel and Rowena banter about where the fault over the spell's failure lies and then have sex. He then assists the Winchesters in their plan to capture Lucifer and use his grace to complete the spell. The plan succeeds and Gabriel travels with the Winchesters and Castiel to Apocalypse World. While traveling to find Mary and Jack, Castiel informs Gabriel of the precarious situation in Heaven but Gabriel is reluctant to intervene. Sam is killed during a battle with a nest of vampires. The group then finds the human camp where Mary and Jack are, and Gabriel and Castiel work together to break the warding against angels so they can enter. After informing Mary and Jack of Sam's demise, Jack asks why Gabriel or Castiel did not revive him, but Gabriel tells him that they are not strong enough. Lucifer then enters the camp with a resurrected Sam. In \\"Exodus\\", Gabriel interacts with his nephew and brother before he angrily disagrees with Lucifer's characterization of his and his family's history, telling Lucifer and Jack that Lucifer only plays the victim to excuse his evil deeds. That night, as Gabriel guards Lucifer, they argue and Gabriel compares Lucifer to a cancer, saying that God was right to cast him into the cage, which causes Lucifer become emotional and shed tears. Later, he helps the Winchesters and their allies evacuate Apocalypse World. The alternate version of Michael then appears, which shocks Gabriel. He watches as Lucifer is tossed aside and Michael setting his sights on him, as Gabriel tells the Winchesters he's not running and decides to confront Michael. They then battle with him doing very well and landing hits on Michael, who overpowers and kills Gabriel with an archangel blade, to the Winchester's horror. The Winchesters use this as a distraction and retreat to their world. They inform Castiel of Gabriel's demise, which saddens him but he takes comfort in being told that he died a noble death in helping them all escape. =Gadreel= An angel portrayed by Tahmoh Penikett and Jared Padalecki, Gadreel was assigned to guard the Garden of Eden but was disgraced when Lucifer got in, which God and angels regarded as his fault. Gadreel was locked up in Heaven's deepest dungeon and heavily tortured for his failure, but was released when Metatron's spell made all angels fall to Earth. Wanting to make up for his past, Gadreel answers Dean's prayers for help, taking on the identity of an angel named Ezekiel, who died in the Fall. When Gadreel's powers cannot heal Sam. he proposes a solution: if he possesses Sam, he could heal him from the inside while recuperating from his own injuries from falling. Dean ultimately agrees and Gadreel invades Sam's mind, assuming Dean's form to manipulate Sam into saying \\"yes,\\" which Gadreel takes as the permission he needs to possess Sam. Gadreel tells Dean that he will let Sam keep control of his body while he himself works in the background, but that it's best that Sam not know he is there. If Sam doesn't allow Gadreel to remain in his body, Sam could eject him and would die as a result. In the following episodes, Gadreel occasionally takes control of Sam's body in order to kill enemies when they get the better of Sam, to resurrect slain allies of Sam and Dean, and to heal the injuries Sam gets on hunts. He regularly erases Sam's memory of these moments in attempt to keep Sam from getting suspicious. Gadreel is wary of Castiel's presence as he fears being found by the angels looking for Castiel to the point that he would have vacated Sam's bodyand in doing so, consigned Sam to dieto flee if Dean hadn't agreed to make Castiel leave the bunker in \\"I'm No Angel\\". When Castiel turns up on a case in mid- season finale \\"Holy Terror,\\" Gadreel once more forces Dean to send him away. In the same episode, he crosses paths with Metatron, who reveals his true identity and backstory and offers him a chance to \\"redeem\\" himself by becoming his lieutenant and helping him usher in a new, better Heaven. After discerning that Dean has learned new information from Castiel that he is not Ezekiel and has turned against him, now attempting to tell Sam the truth and get him to expel him, Gadreel murders Kevin and steals the tablets on Metatron's orders in a show of allegiance to the latter. The following episode, \\"Road Trip\\", Metatron sends Gadreel to kill his former guard and torturer to please his new follower; when he finds out that Gadreel didn't kill Dean as well as Kevin, however, Gadreel is punished by being forced to kill again, this time his old friend Abner. He is then captured by Dean, Castiel, and Crowley, who learn his true identity when Crowley drives spikes through Gadreel's brain to revert him to his trance-like \\"factory settings\\" and an enraged Castiel reveals the cause of Gadreel's infamy to Dean. Gadreel then reverts to normal and tells them that he will not leave Sam's body, nor can they reach Sam, whom he has placed in a fantasy world unaware of what is really happening. With Crowley revealing the truth to Sam by possessing him to communicate with him, Gadreel and Sam fight briefly before Sam finally expels him. Gadreel continues working for Metatron, recruiting angels for their side in \\"Meta Fiction\\" and killing the ones who refuse. Gadreel is captured and interrogated by Sam and Dean, but refuses to give up any information and instead tries to push Dean into killing him, which fails as Dean knows they need Gadreel. Gadreel is saved when Metatron has them trade him Gadreel for Castiel, whom he has captured. In \\"King of the Damned\\", Gadreel meets with Castiel, who tries to persuade Gadreel that he is being used by Metatron and should be working against him, as Castiel's spy. Gadreel declines as he believes that betraying a cause he has dedicated himself to would infringe on his honor; Castiel is sympathetic and leaves his offer open. The next episode, Gadreel discovers that Metatron is having his own angelsones Gadreel himself had recruitedkill themselves as part of a ploy to discredit Castiel, which proves to be the incentive he needed to turn on the cause. Gadreel offers his assistance to Castiel and the Winchesters; although Dean attacks him, Gadreel is saved by Sam and Castiel, who agree to accept his help. In the finale, \\"Do You Believe in Miracles?\\", Gadreel and Castiel plot to sneak into Heaven and break Metatron's connection to the angel tablet, so that Metatron will revert to the powers and weaknesses of a normal angel again and Dean can kill him with the First Blade. However, their scheme is already known to Metatron's angels, who trick them into Heaven's dungeon and imprison them. They cannot convince the angels to help them against Metatron, due to Gadreel's negative reputation. Hoping that he will be remembered as an angel who helped save Heaven instead of the angel who let Lucifer into the Garden, Gadreel sacrifices himself by using the suicide bombers' spell to destroy himself and the dungeon, thus freeing Castiel and in the process convincing one of Metatron's angels (Hannah) of his good intentions. =Hannah= Hannah, portrayed by Erica Carroll and Lee Majdoub in her female and male vessels, respectively, is one of the countless number of angels who fell from Heaven due to Metatron's incantation of the angel banishing spell at the end of \\"Sacrifice\\". She possesses a married woman named Caroline Johnson as her vessel on Earth. In the episode \\"Meta Fiction\\", Hannah and several other angels are lured by the Horn of Gabriel Sigil enchanted by Gadreel. She attempts to sneak and kill Castiel, who is also lured by the sigil, but fails and begs for her life. Joining Castiel, the two arrive at the sigil and meet Gadreel, who offers the two and other angels a chance to join Metatron. When Hannah and her friends refuse, Gadreel proceeds to kill nearly all angels in the area, but spares Hannah, who is healed by Castiel; it is later revealed that Metatron deliberately tells Gadreel to spare Hannah so she could inform Castiel about what happened. Hannah then becomes Castiel's second-in-command from then on, helping him building an angel army in the war against Metatron. In \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", Hannah convinces Dean to approach civilly with Tessa, who has been used by Metatron as a suicide bomber; she becomes furious when Dean apparently killed Tessa with the First Blade (though the latter actually committed suicide), and is further infuriated when she learns from Metatron's broadcast that Castiel had lied about his dwindling grace. Hannah and Castiel's other angel allies join Metatron's army upon Castiel's refusal to kill Dean in retribution for Tessa's death. During Castiel and Gadreel's arrival at Heaven to destroy Metatron's angel tablet in \\"Do You Believe In Miracles?\\", Hannah catches and locks them up in the Heaven's prison. She refuses to believe that killing Metatron would restore the order, accusing Castiel and Gadreel of their lie and selfishness, respectively. However, she becomes convinced when Gadreel kills himself to prove his fidelity to humans, and joins Castiel in his insurgency against Metatron. Eventually, the two manage to topple Metatron, who is imprisoned, though Hannah warns Castiel at the end that his dwindling grace would result in his death. After Metatron's downfall, Hannah takes charge to return all the fallen angels back to Heaven. She contacts Castiel to help her in returning two rogue angels, Daniel and Adina, who have become content with their life on Earth. Though Hannah fails to return the two with their death, Castiel decides to accompany her for the time being in her task. Throughout their journey, the two develop a romantic relationship, with Hannah becoming protective enough of Castiel that she suggests to kill a rogue angel and feed its grace to Castiel, though he declines. However, when she encounters her vessel, Caroline's husband searching for his wife, Hannah realizes that Caroline deserves more chance to enjoy her mortal life. Deciding that she has enjoyed her time on Earth, Hannah releases Caroline of her grace, but not before kissing Castiel; inspired by her decision, Castiel contacts his vessel, Jimmy Novak's family. Since leaving her main vessel, Caroline, Hannah has been taking a man as her new vessel. She blocks Sam and Castiel from entering Heaven to free Metatron, and when the two get around with the plan with Bobby's help, she and several other angels corner Bobby afterwards to punish him for his actions. According to Metatron in Book of the Damned, Hannah has been leading Heaven since his downfall and that it is \\"the best\\" it has ever been since the archangels' disappearances/deaths. In Form and Void, Hannah saves Castiel from being tortured by two angels, but he soon realizes that it is a ruse so she can get information about the Winchesters from him. The two other angels attempt to \\"hack\\" Castiel's brain, something that Hannah is uncomfortable with. While the angels argue, Castiel falls under the influence of Rowena MacLeod's Attack Dog Spell again and breaks free. In the scuffle that follows, Hannah is murdered by the angel Efram for her interference, but Castiel kills both Efram and his partner Jonah in turn. Subsequently, in The Bad Seed, an angel tells a demon that things in Heaven have gotten bad since Hannah's death. =Hester= Hester is an angel portrayed by Emily Holmes who once served under the command of Castiel. After Castiel's departure from Heaven, Hester presumably took control over his garrison. In season 7's \\"Reading is Fundamental,\\" Hester appears in a psychiatric hospital with the angel Inias after Kevin Tran is chosen as a Prophet following the uncovering of the Leviathan Tablet. Hester is disgusted to see Sam with the demon Meg and orders Meg and Sam killed and Kevin taken to the desert. The confrontation is interrupted by the appearance of Castiel who the angels are shocked to see as he is believed to be dead. Hester is enraged by Castiel's appearance after everything he has done and further by his obvious insanity. Before the situation can devolve any further, Dean banishes all three angels using an angel banishing sigil. Later, after Meg kills two demons, Hester returns with Inias and two other angels. Hester refuses to let Kevin translate the tablet for the Winchesters and, blaming Dean for Castiel's state, goes to attack him. When Castiel intervenes, Hester has an emotional breakdown and beats Castiel who refuses to fight back with Hester refusing to relent even when Inias pleads with her to. When Hester goes to kill Castiel, Meg stabs Hester through the back with an angel blade, killing her. Meg justifies that \\"someone had to\\" to her shocked audience. Following Hester's death, the more agreeable Inias takes control of the situation and allows Kevin to finish the translation before sending two angels to protect him at his home rather than the desert. =Ishim= Ishim, portrayed by Ian Tracey, is a powerful angel and garrison commander Castiel once served under appearing in season 12. After the murder of the angel Benjamin in \\"Lily Sunder Has Some Regrets,\\" Ishim calls for a meeting with Mirabel and Castiel, all that is left of his old garrison and is displeased when the Winchesters accompany Castiel. Ishim reveals that in addition to Benjamin's murder, two more angels of their old garrison have been killed over the past few years. After Mirabel leaves and doesn't come back, Ishim heads outside and is shocked to find Mirabel dead and Lily Sunder waiting for him. Lily proves immune to Ishim's smiting power and wounds Ishim with an angel blade before Castiel and the Winchesters intervene, driving her off. Retreating to an old church, Castiel and Ishim recite the story of a time in 1901 when their garrison was sent to execute the angel Akobel for fathering a Nephilim. After Akobel's death, Ishim killed the young girl alone but left her mother, Lily Sunder, alive out of pity. Ishim claims that Lily must've made a deal for demonic power and is left with Castiel as the Winchesters go after Lily. Castiel heals Ishim's injuries, leaving Ishim feeling better than he has in a millennia but leaving Castiel weakened. When the Winchesters confront Lily she reveals the truth: a professor of apocalyptic literature, Lily had been obsessed with angels and eventually discovered a spell to summon one. The spell summoned Ishim who became obsessed with Lily and told her a great many of the angels secrets. However, Lily recognized that Ishim was in fact a monster and left him and married Akobel for protection. Her daughter was human and the murders of Akobel and May were Ishim getting revenge upon her. Lily's powers in fact come from Enochian magic, something that burns away part of her soul every time she uses it. Dean returns to the church and reveals the truth to Castiel, leading to a fight with Ishim who defeats both of them and forces Dean not to use an angel banishing sigil upon him. Lily arrives with Sam and engages Ishim in combat, but proves to be no match for the powerful angel even with Sam and Dean's help. Ishim fights through Lily's telekinesis and attempts to kill her with an angel blade. At the last moment, Castiel stabs Ishim through the back with his own angel blade, killing him and saving Lily as well as avenging Akobel and May. Though Lily achieves her revenge with Ishim's death, she is left unsure of whether or not she can let go of her vengeance upon Castiel. Ishim is mentioned again in season 14's \\"Byzantium.\\" Lily is shown to have given up her revenge with his death and explains that she was so consumed with rage at Ishim, she swore to get revenge upon him even if it meant burning up her entire soul in the process. However, a sliver still survives and her new goal now that she's had her revenge is to get into Heaven to be with her daughter that Ishim murdered. =Jack Kline= Jack Kline, portrayed by Alexander Calvert, is a Nephilim and the son of Lucifer and Kelly Kline. He is the first and only known Nephilim to be sired by an Archangel. Jack was taken in by Sam Winchester and Dean Winchester who would teach him how to master his powers. During this time, Jack played in the resurrection of Castiel who he had chosen as his father. Jack left the Winchesters and Castiel to go off to master his powers and, in an effort to prove that he is good, searched for a way to locate Mary Winchester for her sons. Jack traveled to 'Apocalypse World' where he rescued Mary and they fought Michael's angel army to protect a human colony. Wanting to free the Apocalypse World from Michael's reign, Jack helped Mary to consolidate the human survivor groups to form a resistance and stand against the angels, including an alternate version of Bobby Singer. In the months that followed, Jack's resistance engaged the angels in numerous conflicts; using his abilities, Jack frequently turned the tide of the battle in favor of the resistance, and he gained the respect and admiration of many key leaders. Later, he was reunited with Sam, Dean, and Castiel, during which time he also met his biological father Lucifer and his 'uncle' Gabriel. Lucifer tempted Jack to join his interests by portraying himself as a sympathetic victim; however, Gabriel, Castiel, and the Winchesters reminded Jack of Lucifer's history and encouraged him to trust his instincts. Reluctantly, Jack began to believe Lucifer and hoped they could defeat Michael together. Even so, these hopes were cut short by the Winchesters who stranded Lucifer during the evacuation of the resistance to their world. Lucifer however returned and offered to take Jack to the stars where they could go on a father-son journey cross the known universe. Jack at first accepted, but after discovering that Lucifer cut a deal with Michael to abandon the earth so that it could be completely destroyed, Jack disowned him as his father. In retaliation, Lucifer attacked Jack and stole his grace to attack Michael, kidnapping both Jack and Sam after defeating him. Lucifer attempted to force Jack and Sam to kill each other, but the pair were rescued by Dean (who was empowered by the Alternate Michael). Though Michael/Dean defeated Lucifer, their victory was cut short when Michael assumed complete control of Dean's body. Months after Lucifer's death, Jack struggled with trying to adjust to life as a human; still wanting to contribute, he takes lessons on hunting and magic from the human survivors and Castiel, though he secretly hides an illness that stems from his lack of grace and his body attacking itself. He ultimately succumbs to his illness and ascends to Heaven where he meets his mother for the first time, he is also pursued by the empty's ruler The Shadow who attempts to bring him to his domain. Because of Castiel's intervention, he is resurrected with Enochian magic keeping him alive. In a confrontation with Michael, he taps into the power of his soul and finally kills Michael, ending his reign of terror and absorbing the Archangel's grace to regain his own Nephilim powers. However, he starts to show that he is not necessarily back to himself, since he burned off a large portion of his soul in the process. It Is eventually revealed that Jack used up all of his soul to kill Michael and is now completely soulless. In \\"Moriah,\\" God provides the Winchesters with a gun that can kill Jack, ostensibly due to the danger Jack poses though it will also kill the shooter. Enraged at the loss of his mother, Dean confronts Jack in a cemetery where he has been meeting with Castiel. Rather than fight, Jack accepts that in his soulless state he really is a monster and orders Dean to kill him. However, Dean can't bring himself to kill Jack, enraging God who wanted Jack dead at Dean's hands due to the perfect addition Dean, as Jack's father, killing Jack would make to his story. Even with God offering to resurrect Mary again, Dean refuses to kill Jack, knowing that Mary wouldn't want him to make that deal. With the Winchesters and Castiel turning against him, God smites Jack with a snap of his fingers and begins the end of the world. As all of the souls of Hell rise, Jack awakens in the Empty where he is greeted by the Shadow and Billie. As Jack wonders what's happening, Billie tells him that they need to talk about that. His corpse was subsequently used as a vessel by the demon Belphegor to help the Winchesters after he escaped from Hell. However, Castiel smote Belphegor after learning that the demon intended to use the Winchesters to gain power for himself. This second smiting burnt Jack's corpse into a charred skeleton which was apparently left on the floor of Lilith's Chamber in Hell when Castiel had to climb out before the rupture between Earth and Hell closed. In season 15's \\"The Trap,\\" Jack is revealed to still be awake in the Empty. As he looks around the realm, Billie appears to tell Jack that \\"it's time.\\" In \\"The Gamblers,\\" a resurrected Jack is discovered by Castiel to be hunting Grigori, fallen angels who have been feeding on the souls of innocent people. After killing the Grigori, Jack eats their hearts to grow stronger, but refuses to use his powers as it will draw God's attention to him and reveal his resurrection. Castiel rescues Jack from the last of the Grigori and Jack is reunited with his family. Jack explains that Billie had kept him hidden away in the Empty until God left the Earth at which point it was safe for Billie to resurrect him. Billie has provided Jack with a plan that will allow Jack to become strong enough to kill God himself. In \\"Galaxy Brain,\\" the resurrected Jack is revealed to still be soulless, causing worry amongst the Winchesters given what happened last time. After learning that Kaia is alive and trapped in the Bad Place from Dark Kaia, the Winchesters attempt to find a way back without using Jack's powers. As they attempt to find a solution, Jack views Kaia through Dark Kaia's mind and decides to take the risk to help his friend. With the reluctant help of a Reaper named Merle, assigned by Billie to watch over Jack, the Winchesters and Castiel manage to temporarily hide Jack's use of powers from God, allowing him to open a rift to the Bad Place. After Kaia's rescue, Billie kills Merle for failing to keep Jack in line and explains that everyone has a book in Death's library detailing their fate, even God. The book describing God's ultimate destruction mentions Jack, Sam and Dean, though Billie refuses to elaborate further. In \\"Destiny's Child,\\" the Winchesters discuss the ramifications of Jack killing God and consider having him kill the Darkness as well to maintain the balance. After a brief encounter with an alternate Sam and Dean, Billie arrives to warn that God is almost done destroying alternate universes and will soon return to their world. Billie reveals that she has another quest for Jack, stating that the first was to strengthen his body but the second is more spiritual in nature. Billie instructs them to find the Occultum though she doesn't know where it is and refuses to explain what it will do for Jack. While the Winchesters talk to Anael, Jack speaks with Castiel about being soulless and how he can't feel emotion anymore, something that he is clearly bothered by, though he still understands why he once felt the way he did and the pain Jack caused the Winchesters by killing Mary. Jack questions if Dean will ever forgive him and Castiel assures the young Nephilim that with time Dean likely will. After the Winchesters depart to Hell to search for the Occultum, supposedly hidden there by Ruby, Castiel has Jack drain most of his life force so that Castiel can travel into the Empty and question Ruby herself. Jack reluctantly complies and brings Castiel back on Sam and Dean's orders when they return. Having gotten the Occultum's location, Castiel leads the others to a church guarded by hellhounds where they uncover a small orb. Swallowing the orb, Jack is transported to the Garden of Eden where he is confronted by a mysterious young girl and the Snake. After the Snake asks who Jack is and who he is meant to be, Jack experiences flashes of his life before collapsing in tears. Jack's return to the church kills the hellhounds and Sam and Dean later find him in the bunker's kitchen, crying with remorse and horror over killing Mary. To Sam and Dean's shock, Castiel reveals that the Occultum restored Jack's lost soul. =Jessica= Jessica is a Reaper portrayed by Kayla Stanton who works under Billie following her resurrection as the new Death and is introduced in season 13. Unlike most Reapers, Jessica has a friendly and bright attitude to make it easier for the deceased, but maintains a \\"hands off\\" policy in dealing with the living due to Billie's rules. Jessica first appears in \\"Advanced Thanatology\\" after Dean briefly commits suicide to find out the location of the bodies of a group of ghosts trapped in a house from the ghosts themselves. Jessica greets Dean who simply brushes her off before carrying on. Realizing who Dean is, Jessica travels into the Veil and alerts Billie to Dean's death. After Dean makes a deal with Billie for her to free the ghosts trapped in the house, Billie sends Jessica to complete the deal. Jessica is able to get the ghosts to move onto the afterlife and watches with a smile as they ascend to Heaven before reporting to Billie telepathically that the job is done. As a result of Billie and Jessica freeing the ghosts, the Winchesters are able to alert the authorities to recover the bodies and return them to their families rather than having to salt and burn them. Jessica returns in \\"Funeralia\\" where she reveals that Billie has been having her follow the Winchesters around. Jessica warns the Winchesters that the witch Rowena is killing people ahead of their time and the Reapers sent to collect their souls, thus messing with fate. Due to Billie's rules, Jessica is unable to intervene directly and has instead been sent to warn the Winchesters so they can deal with the problem. During the case, Jessica constantly hovers around the Winchesters, offering information, but refusing to intervene directly in situations even when they are in danger due to Billie's rules. After the situation is resolved, Jessica disappears again. In season 14's \\"Nihilism,\\" a desperate Sam attempts to call on Jessica for help with escaping from Michael's monsters. However, the Reaper Violet appears instead. Violet explains that the Reapers are now on shifts watching the Winchesters instead of Jessica handling the job alone. =Joshua= Joshua is an angel who is described as Heaven's gardener and is portrayed by Roger Aaron Brown and Paul Barton. Following God's departure from Heaven, Joshua is the only angel that God still speaks to, though Joshua himself clarifies that it is more that God talks to him, not that they hold a conversation and he suggests that it's because he can relate \\"gardener to gardener.\\" Joshua first appears in season 5's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" where the Winchesters are instructed to find him by Castiel after they are murdered and end up in Heaven. Castiel sees Joshua as the best chance of finding God or at least of learning what God is saying due to the widespread knowledge of Joshua and God talking. The Winchesters efforts to find Joshua are interrupted by Zachariah who intends to torture them so that Dean will say \\"yes\\" to possession by the archangel Michael. However, Joshua appears to intervene, having been sent by God. Joshua is able to force Zachariah to back off and transports the Winchesters to Heaven's Garden. There, Joshua reveals that while God saved them when Lucifer rose and resurrected Castiel, He has no intention of doing so again and wants them to back off. Joshua expresses sympathy for their cause, telling them that he wishes he could do more \\"but I just trim the hedges.\\" Joshua resurrects Sam and Dean and leaves their memories of their trip to Heaven intact on God's orders. In season 12's \\"Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell,\\" the angel Kelvin reveals to Castiel that Joshua has taken up a leadership role in the hunt for Lucifer's unborn Nephilim son. Kelvin proposes Castiel join the angels search, telling him that if he does, Joshua can get Castiel pardoned for his crimes. After warning the Winchesters about the Prince of Hell Dagon, Castiel travels to Heaven with Kelvin to meet with Joshua. In \\"The Future,\\" Castiel leads an attack to kill Dagon and Kelly Kline, the mother of Lucifer's child, with the Colt on Joshua's orders. The mission results in Kelvin's capture and the death of another angel, but Castiel can't bring himself to outright kill Kelly and instead abducts her. Castiel is instructed by Joshua over \\"angel radio\\" to bring Kelly to the portal to Heaven as passage through it will kill both Kelly and her child. When the two arrive at the portal, Joshua himself emerges to greet them. However, he is combusted to dust moments later by Dagon. After killing Joshua, Dagon reveals that she had learned of their backup plan from Kelvin and laid in wait for hours to ambush the angels when they arrived at the portal. =Kelvin= Kelvin is an angel portrayed by Nathan Mitchell who was a major part of the hunt for Lucifer's unborn Nephilim child. Having met Castiel only once before, Kelvin first appears in season 12's \\"Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell\\" when Castiel is investigating the deaths of two angels at the hands of the Prince of Hell Dagon. Unlike many of his siblings, Kelvin holds no grudge against Castiel and proposes that Castiel join the angels hunt. In exchange, Kelvin promises Castiel that the angel Joshua, who is leading the effort, can get Castiel pardoned for his crimes. After warning the Winchesters about Dagon, Castiel joins Kelvin in going to Heaven to meet with Joshua. In \\"The Future,\\" Kelvin is part of Castiel's team to kill Dagon and the child's mother Kelly Kline with the Colt. During the fight, another angel named Hozai is killed by Dagon and Kelvin is captured while Castiel abducts Kelly and escapes. After communicating with Lucifer telepathically, Dagon extensively tortures Kelvin for information, figuring that despite the fact that Kelvin is unaware of any backup plans, he would be able to figure out what the angels would do next. After killing Joshua, Dagon reveals that she had succeeded in getting information from Kelvin and then killed him hours before. =Lucifer= Lucifer, portrayed primarily by Mark Pellegrino, Jared Padalecki, Misha Collins, Rick Springfield and David Chisum, is the second oldest archangel, the first fallen angel, introduced as a recurring character in the fifth season of the series. From his prison in hell, he orchestrated events not only seen in seasons one through four, but decades prior, to eventually lead to his release by breaking the 66 seals. In the episode \\"Sin City\\", he was described as the 'father' and god of the demons, the one who gave them their form and purpose. Azazel reinforced this by referring to him as \\"My Father\\" while possessing a priest before slaughtering a convent of nuns. However, in \\"Abandon All Hope...\\", Crowley remarks that Lucifer views demons with contempt and his cannon fodder and will destroy them once he has eliminated humanity. In the episode \\"The End\\", Lucifer states his fall was the result of refusing God's decree to love humans more than him. As a result, God had Michael cast him into hell. Ruby also reveals in \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" in defiance to God, he turned Lilith into the first demon. Both Death and Gabriel have compared Lucifer's hatred of humans to \\"\\"one big temper tantrum!\\"\\" because God favored humans over him, his most beloved angel. Lucifer does not like how humans have changed the planet from its original state, and hopes to purify it. He is also very critical of humans, mostly in how they blame him for their own mistakes, wrongdoings, flaws and failures. Creator Eric Kripke has jokingly compared him to a \\"raging psychotic\\" version of environmentalist Ed Begley Jr. with \\"unlimited power\\". Due to his angelic and spiritual nature, Lucifer needs a human vessel in order to interact directly with the physical world. Lucifer seeks out a man named Nick, whose wife and baby had recently been murdered. As revealed in season 14's \\"Damaged Goods,\\" Lucifer himself arranged for the murders through the demon Abraxas so that he could manipulate Nick. Tormenting Nick about the tragedy, he casts illusions such as a baby crying and blood pouring from the crib, eventually appearing to Nick in the form of his late wife Sarah. Openly admitting his identity to Nick, he tries to gain sympathy by telling Nick he was punished for loving God too much. He then convinces Nick to be his vessel by promising to get vengeance against God for allowing his family to be murdered. However, Lucifer later reveals to Sam that he is the true intended vessel. By \\"Abandon All Hope...\\" it is shown Nick's body, being a temporary vessel and not his \\"true\\" vessel, is incapable of containing Lucifer's immense power and is beginning to wear down; revealed in \\"Two Minutes to Midnight\\" he has to consume gallons of demon blood to keep his vessel from combusting. He forms a ritual to summon Death and when the Winchesters, Harvelles and Castiel arrive, he traps Castiel in holy oil and sends Meg after the others. After being ambushed by the brothers he is shot with the Colt but survives; he then reveals his status as one of five things in creation immune to the Colt; while the brothers escape with Castiel's help, he manages to summon Death and bind him under his control. During a convention of pagan gods in \\"Hammer of the Gods\\", Lucifer is made aware of the brothers' location by Mercury, who betrays the rest of them. Slaughtering all the gods, he approaches the brothers and is stalled by Kali until Gabriel arrives. Gabriel provides safe passage for Kali and the brothers, and confronts Lucifer about his ultimate reason for rebellion, claiming that he rebelled not because he recognized that humans were flawed, but because he was no longer their father's favorite son. Lucifer questions Gabriel's loyalties, but he replies that he believes ‚Äî by virtue of his experiences with them ‚Äî humans, despite their flaws, strive to do their best. Ultimately, Lucifer kills Gabriel with his own sword when Gabriel's attempt to catch Lucifer off-guard with a duplicate fails, but he is clearly distraught over this. Having acquired all four rings of the Horseman (which can trap Lucifer back in his prison), Sam and Dean enter Lucifer's hideout, planning to trap him when Sam agrees to be his vessel; this completely fails, as Lucifer is too powerful to fight. Lucifer brings forward four demons, who had been part of Azazel's surveillance of Sam since his youth and kills them all in a way of \\"letting off steam\\" and acquiring Sam's trust. Following that, he confronts Michael in a graveyard, attempting to convince him not to fight, reasoning there was no real purpose; Michael refuses. Dean interrupts, while Castiel dissipates Michael, an act Lucifer took unkindly to, and kills him. He starts to pummel Dean and when Bobby attempts to use the Colt to stop him he is killed as well. However, Sam then sees a toy army man in an ashtray of the Impala, a remnant from his youth, and regains control. Sam reopens the hole, and jumps in, taking Michael with him. Lucifer returns in season seven as part of Sam's hallucinations, caused by the memories of his time in the cage. Lucifer tells Sam that the world he has been in for the last year is not real and Sam is still in the cage, a new form of torture which Lucifer prides himself on as being his best yet. Sam confronts Lucifer and asks him why he doesn't end this dream world to which Lucifer responds by saying that he will only end it when Sam can't take it anymore. Lucifer later changes into Dean and tricks Sam into leaving Bobby's house. Once at the destination, he reveals himself to prove he can control Sam's \\"dream\\", although Lucifer is proven to be a hallucination when Dean tells Sam how to figure out what is real. Despite being proven to be a hallucination, he informs Sam that he's not going anywhere. Lucifer tortures Sam by depriving him of sleep by repeatedly waking him up and later making food look like maggots in an attempt to kill him. Although Sam initially manages to ignore the hallucination, it becomes worse when Sam acknowledges Lucifer's advice when trying to get information about Dean's whereabouts, giving the hallucination additional strength. Castiel, found to be alive, tries to rebuild Sam's mental wall, but fails as it's completely gone. In order to save Sam and atone for what he's done, Castiel transfers the problem to himself, leaving him haunted by Lucifer and stuck in a mental hospital. In \\"Reading is Fundamental,\\" when Castiel comes out of his catatonic state, Sam asks him about seeing Lucifer. Castiel explains that he did at first, but Lucifer eventually disappeared. Castiel believes that Lucifer was simply a projection of Sam's own torment from his time in Hell and that projection disappeared as the torment was no longer in Sam's mind. In the season eight episode \\"Goodbye Stranger,\\" it is revealed that Lucifer had a series of crypts around the United States and possibly the world containing his most precious artifacts. The locations were only known to Lucifer himself and his most trusted followers, such as Azazel. Among the items in his crypts, in an angel-proofed box, was the angel Word of God tablet. Eventually Sam, Dean and Castiel locate the right crypt with the help of Meg who knows from her time with Azazel and get the angel tablet. In the season 10 episode \\"Brother's Keeper\\", Death explains that Lucifer and the other archangels once fought a war with an ancient evil called the Darkness, eventually locking it away. Lucifer was given the Mark of Cain, the lock on the Darkness' prison and the Mark corrupted him into his jealousy towards humanity, leading to his fall into evil. The first mention of Lucifer (and Michael)'s activity since their imprisonment in Hell is mentioned in \\"Out of the Darkness, Into the Fire\\" when an aide of Crowley informs him that ever since the Darkness broke free of its prison, the two archangels are screaming, trying to tell others about the danger the Darkness will pose to the world. In \\"Oh Brother Where Art Thou?\\" and \\"the Devil in the Details\\", Sam travels into Hell to speak to Lucifer, directed by what he believes to be visions from God. Manifesting in the form of Nick, Lucifer is summoned into a smaller cage in Hell where he tells Sam he can defeat the Darkness, but needs Sam to be his vessel again. After the warding suddenly fails, Lucifer teleports Sam into the cage and reveals that he sent the visions to Sam after the Darkness' release damaged his cage and is working with Rowena. Lucifer shows Sam several memories, explaining that while Sam once had the strength to do what needed to be done, he lost that after Dean went to Purgatory. Sam accepts that Lucifer is telling the truth, but refuses to agree to possession again as he knows no matter who wins, Lucifer or the Darkness, humanity is doomed. Lucifer engages Sam, Dean and Castiel in battle, proving to be more than a match for all three together. After Lucifer confirms he can defeat the Darkness, Castiel agrees to possession by him. At that same moment, Rowena completes a spell that apparently banishes Lucifer back to his cage. After the Winchesters leave, Lucifer possessing Castiel reveals himself to Rowena and Crowley and kills Rowena so she can't send him back to the cage. In \\"Into the Mystic\\", Dean finds Lucifer looking through the bunker for a way to summon the Darkness and confides in him about his connection to Amara, believing Lucifer to be Castiel. Lucifer consoles Dean on the connection while secretly interested in this development. In \\"The Vessel\\", Lucifer has regained control of Hell and keeps Crowley as his pet. After receiving a call from the Winchesters, he is shocked to discover that one of the Hands of God survived and agrees to transport Dean back to a submarine in 1943 to get it before the sub sinks. Special warding keeps Lucifer out of the sub and he and Sam attempt to find a way to remove the warding. Sam finds a spell, but doesn't believe it will work as it requires the power of an archangel. As Sam offers his soul to help give \\"Castiel\\" the power he needs, Lucifer reveals himself and attempts to destroy Sam. Castiel regains control temporarily, but is unable to eject Lucifer as it is taking all of his strength to keep Lucifer from killing Sam and only Lucifer has the power to rescue Dean. As Delphine Seydoux unleashes the power of the Hand of God, Lucifer pulls Dean back to the present and reveals himself to Dean. Lucifer throws Dean around the bunker and attempts to use the power of the Hand of God, but finds it expended. As Lucifer advances on Dean, Sam uses a blood sigil to banish him from the bunker. Following his banishment, Lucifer attempts to find another Hand of God through Crowley in \\"Beyond the Mat.\\" To this end, he sets Crowley up to be \\"freed\\" by Lucifer's loyal demon Simmonds so Crowley will lead him to another Hand of God. Crowley leads Lucifer to the Rod of Aaron, but anticipates Lucifer's double-cross. Crowley attempts to kill Lucifer with the Rod's power, but Simmonds takes the brunt of the blast, saving Lucifer. Realizing the Rod's power is expended, Crowley quickly teleports away before Lucifer can kill him. In \\"Hell's Angel\\", Lucifer enters Heaven, killing an angel he finds there and intimidates the angels into following him to combat Amara. Amara unleashes a wave of darkness through Heaven, frightening the angels and pushing them closer to following Lucifer. However, the Winchesters, Crowley and the still-alive Rowena team up together to free Castiel and banish Lucifer back to his Cage. To this end, they summon him into warding in a church surrounded by Holy Fire. Once Lucifer is trapped, Dean attempts to use magic to suppress the archangel to restore Castiel, but Lucifer quickly overpowers it. In a desperate attempt, Crowley enters Castiel's vessel where he finds that Lucifer has \\"really gotten his hooks in good\\" to Castiel who is apathetic to everything around him even as Lucifer appears in the form of Nick and attacks Crowley. Sam exorcises Crowley to save his life and the warding breaks, releasing Lucifer. Lucifer is able to get the Horn of Joshua from the Winchesters, another Hand of God, just before Amara appears. Lucifer blasts Amara with both his own power and the Horn's to no avail. Amara then captures Lucifer and takes him to a grain silo she is using as her base. Believing Lucifer to be the one thing God still cares about, Amara begins torturing him in hopes of drawing God out. Over the next few weeks, Amara tortures Lucifer mercilessly, trying and failing to draw out God. In \\"All in the Family\\", Amara notices that Lucifer is in bad shape along with Castiel and contacts Dean to pass on the message to God. Having learned that God intends to sacrifice Himself to Amara to save the universe, the Winchesters, Metatron and Prophet Donatello Redfern team up together to rescue Lucifer, hoping to convince God to use Lucifer in battle against Amara. As Dean distracts Amara, Sam, Metatron and Donatello find the heavily injured Lucifer who agrees to set aside his differences with God and fight Amara with them. They set him free, but he is too weakened to teleport them to safety. As Amara approaches, Metatron sacrifices himself to buy them time to get away, but Amara quickly catches up to them. Before she can kill the group, God teleports them and the Impala into the Bunker. There, for the first time in millennia, God and Lucifer are reunited. After commenting on how much each other has changed, God heals Lucifer's injuries to the fallen archangel's surprise. In \\"We Happy Few\\", Lucifer sulks around the Bunker, displeased to be reunited with God who won't apologize to him. Fed up with the two's issues with each other, the Winchesters get God and Lucifer to have a sit-down in which things are tense at first but the two eventually reconcile. Now fully on their side, Lucifer joins God in explaining that the last time they defeated the Darkness, it had taken the four archangels and God to barely win and this time Michael is in no shape to battle and Gabriel and Raphael are dead and God can't resurrect them. As a result, the Winchesters suggest pulling in the witches, angels and demons to help them. As God refuses to order the angels to help, Lucifer returns to Heaven where the angels refuse to hear him out. In response, Lucifer returns control to Castiel who tells the angels that Lucifer is burning both himself and his vessel out but he feels his role in the battle is to give Lucifer form on Earth to fight. Castiel and Lucifer are able to convince the angels to join them and Sam and Dean are able to convince the witches and demons respectively. After the witches, angels and demons strike Amara, she enters the warehouse where the Winchesters, God and Lucifer are waiting for her and Lucifer strikes Amara through the back with an angelic spear. Due to her weakened state, Lucifer's strike brings Amara down and she and God confront each other. However, God waits too long to transfer the Mark of Cain to Sam and Amara recovers and attacks God with all of her power. Lucifer attempts to save his father, but Amara flings him against a pillar and yanks him out of Castiel, while leaving Castiel unconscious. In \\"Alpha and Omega\\", Dean goes to check on Lucifer only to find Castiel alone. Castiel tells him that Lucifer is gone from his vessel but he doesn't know what happened to the archangel after Amara pulled him out. In \\"Keep Calm and Carry On\\", a weakened Lucifer searches for a suitable new vessel chased by Crowley, but keeps burning out the people he's possessing. In \\"Mamma Mia\\", Lucifer settles on aging rock star Vince Vincente (Rick Springfield) and gains permission by posing as Vince's dead lover. With a new permanent vessel, Lucifer meets with Crowley who works with Rowena in an attempt to force Lucifer from Vince and back into the Cage. However, the effort fails and Crowley flees while Lucifer captures Rowena. In The Foundry, Lucifer attempts to have Rowena make Vince a permanent vessel for him, but she betrays Lucifer and casts a spell that speeds up Vince's decay and banishes Lucifer to the bottom of the ocean. In \\"Rock Never Dies\\", a pair of amateur Satanists attempt to summon Lucifer who appears in the decaying body of Vince. Lucifer was actually summoned by one of his feathers they had and kills the Satanists then uses the feather to repair his vessel temporarily. Posing as Vince, Lucifer organizes a concert to murder a lot of people and is confronted by the Winchesters, Crowley and Castiel who are unable to defeat him. Lucifer explains to them that he feels that God only made up with him to defeat the Darkness and has abandoned him once more. Lucifer no longer has a plan except to destroy everything he wants and vacates Vince as his body burns out. In \\"LOTUS\\", Lucifer begins possessing people of influence, ultimately possessing President of the United States Jefferson Rooney. As the President, Lucifer sends the Secret Service after the Winchesters and engages in sex with Rooney's mistress Kelly, resulting in her becoming pregnant with his child. Crowley kidnaps Kelly who tricks Lucifer to a motel where the Winchesters, Castiel, Crowley and Rowena are waiting for him. After using a sigil to weaken Lucifer, Sam activates a device created by the British Men of Letters that can exorcise any angel or demon from their vessel. Despite Lucifer's attempts to resist, he is exorcised from Rooney and Rowena casts a spell that apparently returns Lucifer to his cage. At SDCC 2016, it was affirmed that all Lucifer wants is a \\"vacation\\", being tired after ruling both Heaven and Hell, and happy that he finally reconciled with his father. It is soon revealed that Lucifer was not banished back to the Cage, but was actually transferred back into Nick; Crowley retrieved Nick's corpse and had a team of demons 'repair' him, turning Nick into a new Cage where Lucifer cannot leave his vessel and can only use his powers on Crowley's orders. Lucifer is eventually able to turn the tables on Crowley and escape his captivity (although he is still apparently trapped in Nick), with the Winchesters' attempts to stop him banishing him to a parallel universe where the Apocalypse took place because Dean and Sam were never born, although Lucifer is confronted by Crowley who kills himself to trap him, he is able to kill Castiel and take Mary with him. While the Winchesters try to 'raise' Lucifer's son Jack- who grew to adulthood immediately after birth-, Jack is able to help Castiel come back to life, but Lucifer remains in the other world and alerts the alternate Michael to his existence, prompting him to fight alt-Michael but he is defeated. While imprisoned, Alt-Michael drains his powers and tells him of his plans to travel to the 'prime' universe to conquer it as well. Faced with this threat, Lucifer uses a ritual performed by Michael to return to his world to warn them about Michael, but Castiel initially disbelieves him before they are captured by Asmodeus though escape. Lucifer takes control of Heaven since there are too few angels to mount an effective resistance to Michael. Later, he abandons it to find his son and has no luck. During \\"Beat the Devil\\", he drowns his sorrows before he is captured again but by Gabriel and Rowena who survived his attempts on their lives. His grace is used to power the rift and keep it open. Lucifer learns from a taunting Rowena his son is in that world and breaks free. Lucifer's attempt on her life ends up sending him to Apocalypse World where he resurrects Sam who was killed by vampires, having used the grace of Michael's soldiers to refuel himself. He forces Sam to help him form a bond with his son. Lucifer met his son for the first time. During \\"Exodus\\", Lucifer bonds with Jack and is reluctantly allowed to join the team, revealing that they have thirty-one hours before the rift closes again and killing six attacking angels. During this time, Lucifer's efforts to paint himself in a better light are rebuffed by Gabriel who compares his older brother to a cancer that God had to cut out to protect humanity, but too late. Gabriel's words reduce Lucifer to silent tears. Lucifer later works with Dean to repair an old bus and then drives the bus full of refugees back to the rift. When Michael appears and attacks during the exodus through the rift, Lucifer attacks him, but is easily beaten. Following Gabriel's death at Michael's hands, an injured and weakened Lucifer tries to follow Sam through the rift, but is thrown to the ground by the younger Winchester and abandoned to die. With the rift closed, Lucifer makes a deal with Michael to share the spell to reopen it in exchange for Lucifer getting to take Jack while Michael gets everything else. In the season 13 finale \\"Let the Good Times Roll\\", Lucifer reappears in the Winchesters' universe and entices Jack to leave for the stars with him. At the request of Jack, Lucifer resurrects his friend Maggie who subsequently identifies Lucifer as her killer. During a confrontation with Michael, Lucifer's deal with the other archangel is revealed as is his murder of Maggie. Lucifer is forced to admit the truth by Jack who rejects his father after seeing his true nature. Enraged, Lucifer absorbs his son's grace to become more powerful than ever. With Lucifer virtually unstoppable and poised to destroy everything, Dean agrees to become the vessel of the alternate Michael on the condition that Michael power him to battle Lucifer. Powered by Michael, Dean battles Lucifer who still proves to be more than a match for Dean. However, as Lucifer tries to smite Dean, Sam is able to toss Dean the Archangel Blade, the one weapon that can kill an archangel. Armed with the blade, Dean is able to finally kill Lucifer by stabbing him in the heart. However, in the aftermath of Lucifer's death, Michael betrays his deal with Dean, takes full control of him and disappears. In season 14's \\"Stranger in a Strange Land,\\" Lucifer's vessel Nick is revealed to have survived Lucifer's death. Nick has nightmares and flashbacks to his time as Lucifer's vessel and a slowly healing wound in his side where Lucifer was stabbed. Sam and Mary both have trouble looking at Nick due to his time under Lucifer's control, but he is able to tell Sam that Michael had told Lucifer that he wants to \\"do it right this time\\" when discussing his plans for the Winchesters' world. Nick subsequently shows Lucifer-like behaviors when angered in \\"Gods and Monsters,\\" causing Castiel to suspect that Lucifer did more damage to Nick's psyche than was previously realized. In \\"Unhuman Nature,\\" Nick's bloody quest for revenge leads to him becoming a serial killer. After killing Frank Kellogg, the man who was possessed by the demon Abraxas when Abraxas murdered his family, Nick prays to Lucifer, having realized that he enjoyed being the archangel's vessel and the freedom that came with it. In response to Nick's prayer, a figure with glowing red eyes rises in the Empty, presumably Lucifer himself, somehow awakened from his eternal sleep by Nick's prayer. In \\"Damaged Goods,\\" Nick manages to track down the demon Abraxas who murdered his family. During a confrontation, Abraxas reveals to a shocked Nick that it was in fact Lucifer himself who ordered the death of Nick's family at Abraxas's hands. Abraxas tells Nick that while he was chosen, Nick was nothing special and that \\"we threw a dart at the phone book\\" to choose Nick. The enraged Nick then kills Abraxas with an angel blade in revenge for his family's murders. During the confrontation, despite previously being loyal to Lucifer, the demon shows no real care that Lucifer is dead, simply responding that it's \\"cool\\" when Nick tells Abraxas who is also amused that Nick is no longer under the control of Lucifer. In \\"Prophet and Loss,\\" Nick begins seeking out Lucifer to reunite with him. In \\"Game Night,\\" Nick kidnaps prophet Donatello Redfield and boosting Donatello's abilities with angel grace, communicates with the awakened Lucifer in the Empty. Lucifer provides Nick with a way to resurrect him using his son's blood. Nick succeeds in getting the blood and performs the spell, opening a portal to the Empty from which Lucifer emerges in the form of a viscous black humanoid figure with wings. However, Jack arrives with Mary Winchester, kills Nick and banishes Lucifer back to the Empty. In \\"Absence\\" and \\"Jack in the Box,\\" Jack is haunted by a hallucination of Lucifer, the form that his subconscious takes after Jack accidentally kills Mary. In season 15's \\"Proverbs 17:3,\\" Sam experiences a vision, part of a series of nightmares he has been having, featuring Lucifer possessing him and wearing a white suit much as Lucifer did in \\"The End.\\" Dean attempts to kill the archangel with the Colt, but Lucifer is unharmed by the shot and burns Dean to death after stating that they both always knew it had to end this way. Sam later comes to the conclusion that he is witnessing Chuck's possible endings for them. In \\"The Trap,\\" this is revealed to be the Lucifer of an alternate reality with Chuck explaining that what Sam actually witnessed were Chuck's memories of alternate Sams and Deans. A homage to John Milton's Paradise Lost, Lucifer will be portrayed as \\"gentle, almost sympathetic\\". Kripke reasoned, \\"He was essentially betrayed, so in some ways he can be viewed sympathetically ... if we can make the angels dicks, Lucifer can be sympathetic.\\" Kripke further characterized him as a \\"Devil who has doubt\\" and \\"a lot of affection for God and the angels\\", and who \\"speaks really tenderly and gently and...doesn't lie\\". Pellegrino was the second choice to play the angel Castiel, losing the role to Misha Collins. =Metatron= Metatron (Curtis Armstrong) is the angel who wrote the Word of God tablets. According to the demon tablet, he is an Archangel, but Metatron himself claims to be an angel from the secretarial division who was enlisted by God to write the tablets before he left Heaven. God later claims that there was no special reason he chose Metatron, that Metatron was just the closest angel to the door when he walked in. When God left and the Archangels decided to take over everything, Metatron left Heaven and hid on Earth, cutting himself off completely to protect himself and the tablets as he rightly assumed that the Archangels would need him to fulfil their plans. On Earth, Metatron lived among a Native American tribe known as The Two Rivers who he gave immortality in exchange for stories and books. Metatron became enamored by human stories and even though he read as much as an angel is capable of, he hasn't been able to read every story written during the past few millennia he has spent on Earth. Sam and Dean first learn of Metatron when they uncover the Leviathan Word of God tablet and Castiel reveals Metatron wrote them. At the time, Dean considers looking for him for help with the Leviathans. Later, Kevin Tran finds a personal note Metatron left on the demon tablet revealing that there is a compendium of tablets. While trying to find the third trial to close Hell, Sam and Dean track down Metatron and confront him. Metatron initially refuses to help, but after they reveal the story of Kevin Tran, Metatron rescues him from Crowley and heals him. Metatron now knows what is going on in Heaven and the world and agrees to help and along with Kevin, reveals the third trial: curing a demon. He also suggests to Dean that closing Hell may not be the best idea, telling him he needs to consider the impact it will have on the world. Metatron later approaches Castiel to seek his help in dealing with the problems in Heaven. Heaven has degenerated into all out war between various factions and Metatron wants to seal it up. As the Scribe of God, he knows the three trials without the angel tablet, but wants Castiel to do them. The two set out to complete the first trial which is to kill a Nephilim and cut out their heart. Though Castiel hesitates, when the Nephilim overpowers both himself and Metatron, he kills her from behind while she is distracted with Metatron. In \\"Sacrifice,\\" Metatron reveals that the second trial is to get the bow of a Cupid and as he works with Castiel to get it, he is captured by Naomi. Metatron recognizes Naomi as the angel that was supposed to \\"debrief\\" him for the Archangels after God left, in reality to get his secrets from his mind. Suspicious of why Metatron has suddenly come out of hiding, Naomi tortures him for information and is shocked to learn that he actually intends to expel all angels from Heaven except himself as revenge for his own expulsion. Naomi rushes off to warn Dean and Castiel, but while she is gone, Metatron breaks free and kills Naomi when she returns. He captures Castiel and takes his Grace as the final component needed for his spell then sends him to Earth to live a human life after asking Castiel to find him and tell him about it when he one day dies. Metatron's plan works and all angels are expelled from Heaven. Sam and Dean learn in \\"Heaven Can't Wait\\" that Metatron designed the spell to be irreversible and there is apparently no way to put the angels back in Heaven. Metatron eventually reappears on Earth in the episode \\"Holy Terror\\" during the struggle of the various angel factions to wrest control and decide the best course to retake and re-enter Heaven. In that time, he convinces Gadreel to join him in the refashioning of the angels' purpose in existence, resulting in Kevin Tran's death and Gadreel's taking full control of Sam's body. In \\"Road Trip,\\" he employs Gadreel as his assassin, sending him to kill angel guard Thaddeus and Gadreel's friend Abner, presumably as a further test of his loyalty. He is also annoyed by Gadreel not killing Dean and questioning his orders. Metatron waits for Gadreel to return from killing Abner in a bar for hours with Gadreel's former vessel and is surprised when Gadreel suddenly appears in his natural form and repossesses his old vessel. Realizing that Sam has expelled Gadreel, an amused Metatron asks if Gadreel had Winchester troubles. After getting the tablets, Metatron connects himself to the angel tablet, granting him God-like power. Continuing his efforts with Gadreel's help, Metatron recruits a following and begins writing his own epic \\"story\\" about how things will go. To this end he captures Castiel during \\"Meta Fiction\\" and asks him to be the villain in the story in exchange for an unlimited supply of grace as his stolen grace is burning out. Castiel refuses and Metatron is forced to trade Castiel for Gadreel after Sam and Dean capture the latter. With his new powers, Metatron proves immune to their efforts to trap them and lets them go as he doesn't see them as a threat though he is undeterred by this setback. Following this, Castiel gathers his own following to battle Metatron who has Gadreel eliminate other angels who could be a threat to him. As Castiel's following grows stronger than his own, Metatron uses brainwashed suicide bombers in \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" to convince the other angels that Castiel is not who they should follow. Metatron offers the angels a return to Heaven through a moving portal he has created in return for their fealty to him. After Castiel refuses to kill Dean for supposedly killing the Reaper Tessa, Castiel's followers abandon him for Metatron. However, it also backfires on Metatron in that his methods cause Gadreel to switch sides too. During \\"Do You Believe In Miracles?\\", after broadcasting to all angels over \\"angel radio\\", Metatron heads to Earth to convert humanity to following him instead of God by performing various miracles including raising the dead. Dean, armed with the First Blade and powered by the Mark of Cain confronts Metatron as Castiel and Gadreel try to break into Heaven and shatter Metatron's power. With his new power, Metatron proves too powerful for Dean and mortally wounds him. However, before he can finish the job, Gadreel's sacrifice allows Castiel to shatter the angel tablet and Metatron's incredible power, forcing him to flee an attack by Sam. In Heaven, Metatron binds Castiel and taunts him about how the angels are all sheep who will follow him and how he doesn't really care about them. However, Castiel had secretly activated the broadcasting equipment in Metatron's office, causing him to broadcast the truth to all angels. Metatron's own followers turn on and overpower him, but Castiel locks him in Heaven's dungeon rather than kill him. At the same time, his killing of Dean causes him to resurrect as a demon. In \\"Reichenbach\\", Hannah approaches Metatron to see if he has any of Castiel's grace left in hopes of saving him from dying when his stolen grace burns out. Metatron claims there is some left and offers to hand it over in exchange for his freedom, claiming that he will leave the planet if set free. Castiel refuses however and Metatron reveals that he really plans to get revenge once he escapes, though he claims there is some grace left. In \\"The Hunter Games\\", hoping that Metatron knows of a cure to the Mark, Castiel has him brought to Earth where he and the Winchesters question him for information. Metatron claims there is a cure to the Mark and that it requires the First Blade, but when Dean demands the rest, he reveals that there is a lot of steps and he wants something for each one. Dean tortures Metatron who continues to taunt him into giving in to the Mark's rage, but he is stopped by Castiel and Sam before he can kill him. Castiel returns Metatron to Heaven for safety with Metatron saying that he will choose death over helping again. However, he leaves a possible clue: \\"behold, the river shall end at the source.\\" In \\"Inside Man\\", desperate to find a cure for Dean's deteriorating condition, Sam, Castiel and Bobby Singer plot to break Metatron out of prison when the angels refuse to release him to their custody for fear of what he will do if released. On Earth, Metatron taunts them with his leverage over them until Castiel removes his grace, leaving Metatron human and mortal. After Sam shoots him in the leg and Castiel threatens his life, Metatron quickly gives in and admits that he knows of no cure for the Mark, stating that it is God-level or Lucifer-level power and he knows nothing and that not even the tablets contain information on the Mark. Castiel is able to tell that Metatron is telling the truth, but before Sam can kill him, Metatron tells them that he was telling the truth about there being some of Castiel's grace left and offers to lead him to it in exchange for his life. Castiel reluctantly agrees and sets off in search of his grace with Metatron. In \\"Book of the Damned\\", Metatron and Castiel go on a road trip to find Castiel's grace. Metatron starts to embrace his new humanity, annoying Castiel with his antics and leading to Metatron getting punched. At a diner, they come under attack by an angry Cupid and Metatron kills him to save Castiel, but fails to endear himself to Castiel with his actions. Finally, the two come to a library where Metatron reveals he had another angel hide the grace and leave him clues so no one else could find it or torture the information from him. Searching through the books for one with the title \\"what's the most insane thing a man can do?\\", Metatron engages Castiel in a conversation, asking him what he will do once he tracks down the remaining rogue angels as Hannah has restored order to Heaven. While Castiel is distracted, Metatron uses his blood to cast a spell that stuns Castiel and retrieves the demon tablet, what he had really come for. However, he discovers that Castiel has found his grace in a copy of Don Quixote and quickly leaves before he can recover. Castiel gets his grace back and is restored to full power, but he and Sam are left worried by what Metatron can do with the demon tablet despite now being human. They also lie to Dean about how Castiel got his grace back, telling him that Hannah got it out of Metatron and not mentioning his escape. It is later mentioned he got away by stealing Castiel's car. In \\"Out of the Darkness, Into the Fire\\" and \\"Into the Void\\", the other angels are searching for Metatron to imprison him again while in \\"The Bad Seed\\", the Winchesters and Castiel reluctantly search for him hoping he has information on The Darkness. To their surprise, they can find no incidents with Castiel's car that indicate that Metatron got in an accident or even got a ticket, surprising Castiel as he didn't expect a former angel and shut-in to be a good driver. In \\"Our Little World\\", Castiel spots Metatron's reflection in a camera shot of a murder on the news, revealing that Metatron has become a videographer. Castiel tracks Metatron down at the scene of a shooting where Metatron steals the victim's money and bemoans his lack of power which he wouldn't have used to help the man anyway. After healing the man and breaking Metatron's camera, Castiel drags him to an abandoned warehouse where Metatron tells him he has come to see reality as the new literature and himself as the \\"author of reality\\" in his job as a videographer. Metatron tries to lie about the location of the demon tablet, but Castiel has already found it by simply searching Metatron's apartment where he had it hidden under his mattress. Castiel demands information on the Darkness and while Metatron knows something, he refuses to tell Castiel and taunts him into attacking Metatron. Castiel stops when he realizes that Metatron wants to die and Metatron explains that he can't stand being human. He finally tells Castiel that the Darkness is God's sister who He had to give up to form creation. Castiel lets Metatron go, telling Sam and Dean that he is now a human and a pitiable one at that and is no threat anymore. If Metatron draws any sort of attention to himself, the angels will descend on him and destroy him for his actions. Months later in \\"Don't Call Me Shurley\\", Metatron is living as a homeless vagrant but has gained a more compassionate nature as demonstrated by him feeding a stray dog food he found in a dumpster rather than eating it himself. Metatron and his dog are transported to a bar where Metatron meets with Prophet Chuck Shurley who reveals himself to in fact be God. God doesn't punish Metatron for his rogue actions, though He also refuses to restore Metatron to being an angel, something Metatron admits is probably a good thing. Instead, God asks Metatron to help Him write His autobiography. Metatron helps God work on the autobiography and is stunned by how apathetic God has become to the world and the situation with Amara. After learning that Amara has infected a town with an infection of insanity, Metatron pleads with God to help, now understanding that humanity is God's greatest creation and is better than God because humans have many flaws, but they still try. God apparently refuses to listen, but Metatron reads the end of his autobiography and is shocked by what he reads while God intervenes to stop Amara's infection and to save the Winchesters. In \\"All in the Family\\", Metatron contacts the Winchesters and warns them that God intends to sacrifice himself to Amara in an attempt to save the universe. Wanting to do whatever he can to save God and humanity, Metatron offers the Winchesters whatever help he can give them and joins Sam and the Prophet Donatello in a rescue mission for Lucifer. As Sam and Lucifer discuss the situation, Metatron casts a spell to release Lucifer from his bindings, but Lucifer is incapable to teleporting them to safety. As Amara approaches, Sam, Lucifer and Donatello flee but Metatron stays behind to hold off Amara and buy them time. Metatron unsuccessfully uses an angel banishing sigil on an amused Amara and asks her to spare the universe as God had only meant well. Telling Metatron \\"spare this\\", Amara surrounds Metatron in darkness and implodes him into nothingness. After being informed of Metatron's death, Dean admits he's surprised Metatron sacrificed himself for them. =Michael= Michael is the oldest and, possibly, most powerful Archangel, featured in the fifth season of Supernatural. In the premiere of the fifth season Zachariah reveals the angels' plan is for Michael to use Dean as his vessel and kill Lucifer once and for all. However, Dean needs to give his consent to be the vessel. Michael refers to Lucifer as his younger brother and when Lucifer refused God's command to bow before humanity, he turned to Michael for support, but was refused. On God's command, Michael cast Lucifer into Hell. Michael first appears when Sam, Dean, and Castiel have traveled back to 1977 to stop Anna from killing John and Mary in order to prevent Sam's birth, and thus his use as Lucifer's vessel. When the angels develop a new plan to lure Dean into consenting in \\"Point of No Return\\", the angels bring back Adam, John Winchester's third son, under the pretense that he can be Michael's new vessel, but this is merely a ruse to get Dean to say yes. Zachariah tortures Sam and Adam until Dean consents. Zachariah then summons Michael from Heaven, but Dean changes his mind, kills Zachariah and attempts to escape. Adam is inadvertently locked inside while Michael descends, and the room and Adam disappear. In \\"Two Minutes to Midnight\\", Castiel confirmed that now Michael is taking Adam as his vessel. During the episode \\"Swan Song\\", Michael appears with Adam as his vessel in order to fight Lucifer, but gets interrupted by Dean, Bobby, and Castiel, who delay him by sending him away with holy fire. In a couple of minutes he returns to see Sam, who has taken control over Lucifer, ready to jump in the pit, and tries to stop him, claiming his destiny is to fight his brother. As Sam denies, Michael makes a final desperate effort to hold him, but is swept along by Sam and they fall into the abyss together. Castiel believes that he and Lucifer tortured Sam's soul in the cage until it was removed by Death, one of the horsemen. Michael's first mention of activity since his imprisonment in Hell is mentioned in \\"Out of the Darkness, Into the Fire\\", in which an aide of Crowley informs him that Michael is wailing, trying to tell others about the danger the Darkness, which recently broke free from its prison, will pose to the world. In \\"The Devil in the Details\\", Lucifer tells Sam that \\"prison life\\" hasn't agreed with Michael and indicates that Michael's time in the Cage has driven him insane. When talking about their coming battle with the Darkness, God echoes this, telling the Winchesters that Michael is in no shape to fight a battle. In season 15's \\"Back and to the Future,\\" the demon Belphegor tells Dean that every door in Hell was opened by God, including that of Lucifer's Cage. Concerned, Dean asks about Michael and Belphegor tells Dean that last he heard, Michael was just sitting in the Cage. However, Belphegor suggests that if Michael does get out, he will want revenge. In \\"Our Father, Who Aren't In Heaven,\\" the Winchesters and Castiel learn from the demon tablet that God has a secret weakness that he only shared with his favorite. Suspecting this to be Michael, they decide to travel into Hell to speak with him with Dean suspecting that God and Lucifer had lied about Michael's insanity. However, by this point, Michael has already escaped from both the Cage and Hell and returned to Earth where, still in the body of Adam Milligan, he shares control with his vessel. With the other archangels dead and God gone, Michael is now directionless and dispatches Lilith when the demon arrives to take him to God. After Castiel prays to him, Michael agrees to meet with his brother, though he is less than pleased to see the other angel given Castiel's role in his imprisonment in the Cage. The Winchesters and Castiel take Michael captive and attempt to convince him that God is the threat and they need Michael's help to stop him. Even with Adam, who reveals that he and Michael reached an understanding the Cage, helping, Michael refuses to listen as it would mean God's Favorite Son doubting him. In a final effort, Castiel shows Michael his own memories of God's betrayals, including the battle with the Darkness, the murder of Lucifer's son Jack and the Apocalypse World Michael. Completely disillusioned, Michael provides Castiel and Dean with the spell to trap God, but warns that it requires a flower that only grows in Purgatory. Michael opens a twelve-hour portal for them to Purgatory, but refuses to stay and help. Dean releases the archangel who allows Adam to take control again so that Dean can apologize to his brother before Adam and Michael leave. Apocalypse World Michael In season 13, an alternate reality version of Michael is depicted in Apocalypse World portrayed by Christian Keyes and Jensen Ackles. This version of Michael won the Apocalypse when it occurred, killing his version of Lucifer. Now a twisted and corrupt version of what he once was, Michael rules Apocalypse World with an iron fist and is waging a war of genocide upon the human race. Lucifer himself calls this Michael \\"pure evil\\", a fact that is highlighted by the fact that the source of the comment is Lucifer. More powerful than the Michael the Winchesters are used to, he captures Lucifer and Mary Winchester and tortures them. Learning of the Winchesters' world, Michael intends to lead an invasion to destroy the human population and take over that world as well. An attempt to open a door between the worlds with the help of the Prophet Kevin Tran allows Lucifer to escape to his own world with his grace diminished after some of it was used by Michael as a power source for the portal. From Lucifer, Castiel learns of Michael's impending invasion and warns the Winchesters while Asmodeus, the current ruler of Hell, learns of it as well and begins preparing by getting the Archangel Blade, the only weapon that can kill an archangel such as Michael or Lucifer. An attempt by the Winchesters to open another door between the worlds leads to Michael capturing the Nephilim Jack, the one being powerful enough to open the door for him. Jack eventually escapes with Mary Winchester and an attempt by Zachariah to recapture him leads to Zachariah's death. Seeing the state of Apocalypse World, Mary and Jack form a resistance against Michael with the intention of killing him to save both worlds. As the war continues, Michael compels the Prophet Kevin Tran to commit a suicide bombing against the resistance in a somewhat successful effort to break Jack's spirit by showing Jack that he can't save everyone. In the penultimate episode of season 13 \\"Exodus\\", the Winchesters return to Apocalypse World with Lucifer and Gabriel in an effort to finally rescue Mary and Jack. With Mary unwilling to leave the people behind, the Winchesters lead an exodus through the rift back to their universe. However, Michael himself interrupts the exodus in hopes of preventing their escape and using the rift to reach their world. Though surprised to see Gabriel, Michael doesn't hesitate to engage his younger brother, quickly overpowering Gabriel and killing him with an Archangel Blade. Gabriel's sacrifice enables the Winchesters to escape, leaving Michael stuck in Apocalypse World with Lucifer when the rift closes moments before Michael can reach it. Lucifer subsequently offers Michael a deal where he will share the spell to reopen the rift and in exchange, he and Michael will travel to the Winchesters' world together where Lucifer will get his son and Michael will get the chance to conquer everything else. In the season 13 finale \\"Let the Good Times Roll\\", Michael unexpectedly attacks the Winchesters in a gas station near their bunker, having arrived in their world with Lucifer. Dean manages to hold Michael at bay long enough to escape with holy fire, but Michael soon breaks free and attacks the Winchesters bunker, easily defeating all resistance and preparing to kill Dean. Sam is able to summon Jack for help through a prayer and Jack attacks Michael, seriously injuring him. Before Jack can kill Michael, Lucifer's evil deeds are revealed to his son and Lucifer steals Jack's grace and departs with Jack and Sam. In the aftermath, a weakened Michael warns Dean and Castiel that Lucifer is now \\"super-charged\\" and can destroy the universe if he wishes. While Michael once had the power to stop him, he is now too weak to do so, particularly in his injured state with a battered vessel. Desperate to stop Lucifer, Dean remembers that he is the Michael Sword, Michael's one true vessel with whom Michael will be more powerful than ever. With Michael acknowledging that by working together, he and Dean would have a chance against Lucifer, Dean offers Michael a deal where he will become Michael's vessel to fight Lucifer, but Dean will remain in control while Michael powers him. Michael consents to the deal and gains Dean as his vessel. With Michael powering him from within, Dean gains access to the archangel's teleportation, strength, invulnerability and flight capabilities, allowing him to fight Lucifer on a more even level and ultimately kill him with Michael's Archangel Blade. With Lucifer dead, Michael betrays his deal with Dean, takes full control of his body and departs, loose upon the Winchesters' world in his true vessel. Three weeks after possessing Dean in season 14's \\"Stranger in a Strange Land,\\" Michael travels around asking various people and beings \\"what do you want?\\" while trying to figure out the answer in regards to himself. In the end, Michael decides to form an alliance with monsters, seeing them as pure as all they want to do is feed. In \\"Gods and Monsters,\\" Michael performs experiments using angel grace to enhance the powers of monsters. After several misfires, Michael perfects his methods and begins building an army of enhanced monsters loyal to him by making a deal with a werewolf pack leader. During this time, Dean manages to briefly surface in a mirror and attempts to order Michael out of his body to no luck. Michael baits a trap for Sam, Mary and Bobby Singer using a vampire he had purposefully let escape. Michael's enhanced werewolves, who are immune to silver, attack the hunters who are caught off-guard but manage to kill the monsters through decapitation. Moments later, Dean arrives, himself once more and with Michael mysteriously gone from his body. Dean tells the others that Michael left his body on his own and he has no idea why the archangel left him. In \\"The Scar,\\" Dean has Castiel go through his memory in hopes of learning what happened to Michael after finding a mysterious scar upon his arm. Castiel is able to locate a memory of Michael getting stabbed in the arm with the spear of the Kaia Nieves from the alternate reality known as the Bad Place. Sam, Dean and Jody Mills track down Kaia who is being hunted by Michael's enhanced vampires. During a confrontation with Kaia, Dean remembers Michael attempting to make a deal with Kaia who refused and attacked him with the spear which is capable of harming and possibly killing Michael. Following an attack by three more of Michael's monsters, Kaia departs with the spear despite the fact that Michael will never stop hunting her as long as she has it. Dean tells Sam afterwards that being possessed by Michael was like drowning to him and he blames himself for Michael's rampage. In \\"Nightmare Logic,\\" the Winchesters and Bobby face a djinn whose powers have been enhanced by Michael. The djinn explains that Michael, while still in Dean's body, had ordered him to set himself up someplace quiet and act as a trap for hunters. Before Dean kills him. the djinn warns that Michael has dozens of similar traps all over for hunters. Afterwards, the Winchesters spread the word to other hunters to be on the lookout for Michael's monster traps. In \\"Nihilism,\\" Sam and Castiel manage to trap Michael using a combination of a holy fire cocktail and the angel cuffs. However, Michael simply summons monsters to rescue him. Trapped, Sam attempts to get help from the Reaper Violet who refuses until the group is suddenly teleported to the Bunker. Michael is chained to a post, but summons his army to rescue him and works to instill doubts in Jack and Castiel over Dean's relationship with them. Michael reveals that after learning about God from Dean's mind, he has come to believe that God considers both worlds \\"failed drafts\\" and has left to start again. Michael states that he intends to destroy all of the worlds he can until he finds God and kills him too. In an attempt to stop Michael, Sam and Castiel use the British Men of Letters mind-link device to enter Dean's mind to try to get him to throw Michael out, locating Dean in a world Michael has created for him where Dean is perfectly happy. After Dean is reminded of the truth, Michael appears in the bar and taunts Dean over him supposedly seeing Sam and Castiel as burdens. However, they realize that Michael is just stalling and is powerless in Dean's mind. Despite this, Michael retains his superior fighting skills and warns that Dean will be burnt out if he kicked out of Dean's body. In response, the three team up together to trap Michael in the bar cooler, effectively trapping Michael in Dean's mind. Though Dean intends to be Michael's cage, he continues to work to break free while his army disbands without Michael able to control them. Billie later visits Dean and warns him that all versions of Dean's fate but one have Michael escaping and using Dean's body to destroy the world. Billie shows Dean the single fate where Michael loses, shocking him at what it reveals must be done. In \\"Damaged Goods,\\" Dean reveals that it is to lock himself in a magical box, an impenetrable prison even for an archangel and imprison them both at the bottom of the ocean. However, Sam and Castiel talk him out of the plan in \\"Prophet and Loss.\\" In \\"Ouroboros,\\" Dean is knocked unconscious during a hunt by a Gorgon, allowing Michael to escape from his prison. Rather than possessing Dean again, Michael sought revenge on him and his family for humiliating him. He leaves Dean's body and forces the witch Rowena MacLeod to say \\"yes\\" and slaughters several hunters. As Michael gloats to the Winchesters and Castiel who he tortures, until Jack taps into the power of his soul to face off with Michael. Jack is able to exorcise Michael from Rowena and causes the swirling cloud of light that Michael becomes to burn up, as he deems that he won't hurt anyone again. Jack then takes to absorbing Michael's grace in the process. Jack announces to the others that Michael is dead and his grace has fully restored Jack's powers. However, it's later revealed the killing Michael burned away Jack's soul, leaving him completely soulless. In season 15's \\"Our Father, Who Aren't In Heaven,\\" Castiel shows the Michael of the Winchesters' world some of his memories of this Michael amongst other things while trying to convince him of God's betrayal. Michael is completely disillusioned after this, particularly as he now knows that he is not the only Michael. =Naomi= Naomi, portrayed by Amanda Tapping, is a \\"cool\\", \\"mysterious\\", and \\"polished\\" villain affiliated with a previously unknown faction of angels, eventually revealed to be \\"Heaven's intelligence division,\\" a group tasked with secretly brainwashing angels and altering their memories to keep them both in-line with Heaven's orders and oblivious to the truth of their actions and goals. When Naomi was being cast, the character was compared to The Good Shepherd's antihero Edward Wilson, Sr. (Matt Damon), in that she is \\"willing to sacrifice everything for the greater good.\\" In his 2014 revision of The Essential Supernatural: On the Road with Sam and Dean Winchester, Nicholas Knight described her as \\"a powerful angel...ruthless in her quest to prevent the angel tablet from falling into the wrong hands\\". Despite her role as an antagonist, Knight noted that Naomi \\"quickly became one of the most enigmatic and popular new characters of the (eighth) season.\\" Naomi first appears at the end of the episode \\"A Little Slice of Kevin\\", where she claims responsibility for Castiel's mysterious return from Purgatory though he cannot remember her, and demonstrates her complete control over his actions by command. Although she tells him off-screen that she is the current ruler of Heaven, Metatron later claims that she is only one of many faction leaders at war with each other. In \\"Torn and Frayed\\", Naomi tasks Castiel with rescuing Samandriel after she gets a distress call from the latter when he is under torture from Crowley. Upon learning that Samandriel has revealed the existence of the angel Word of God tablet to Crowley, however, she forces Castiel to kill the other angel, which she justifies by emphasizing the tablet's importance and that any angel would die to protect it, calling Samandriel a traitor for divulging information about it. Prior to his death, Samandriel had been trying to tell Castiel something about Naomi, triggering a memory of Castiel's in which Naomi was approaching his eye with a mysterious instrument resembling a drill while he was restrained and screaming. Noticing Castiel's strange actions and behavior, the Winchesters become suspicious that Castiel is being controlled. \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" opens with the revelation that Naomi has been working on fully indoctrinating Castiel to her control, and determines him to be \\"ready\\" once he kills thousands of copies of Dean. She then sends him to get the angel tablet before Crowley can. After he finds the tablet and she orders him to kill Dean, Castiel manages to fight her control and eventually breaks it by touching the tablet. He tells Dean about her before going into hiding to protect the tablet. In an encounter with Crowley, Naomi says that Castiel is doing what he is meant to do: protect the tablet, even if it means protecting it from her. She is later shown to be searching for Castiel to find the tablet. In \\"Taxi Driver,\\" Naomi meets with Dean to try to convince him that she is on his side, claiming that Castiel had misinformed him about her due to his mental instability, and that she wants to help Castiel; Dean doesn't believe her. Nonetheless, Naomi tips him off to the danger Sam is in and later saves Sam and Dean from Crowley, driving the demon off and helping the Winchesters complete the second trial to seal Hell by enabling a trapped Bobby's soul to ascend to Heaven. She reiterates that Dean can trust her and that they all share the goal of sealing Hell. Naomi and her angels eventually slaughter the patrons of a restaurant they know Castiel is passing through, and leave one alive but traumatized in order to make him stop long enough for them to capture him; Naomi kills the survivor afterward, rejecting Castiel's angry reminder that they (angels) are supposed to guard humans. She interrogates Castiel about the location of the tablet, and reveals that she has been altering and erasing his memories for longer than believed, complaining that he has never functioned as he was supposed to. She flees when Crowley attacks her men and fires at her with a gun loaded with melted-down angel blades. In the eighth-season finale, Naomi learns that Metatron is working with Castiel, prompting her to capture the rogue angel and use her drill-like instrument to access his thoughts and learn his plans; when she finds out what they are, she is horrified and immediately warns Dean and Castiel, revealing that Metatron is not trying to close the gates of Heaven, but rather trying to permanently expel all angels in revenge for having himself had to flee to escape her and the archangels, who had ordered her to detain him and take the knowledge he had as the Scribe of God after God left Heaven. Naomi expresses remorse for her actions and that of the other angels, saying that angels are meant to protect humanity and they have lost sight of that somewhere along the way. To begin making amends, she warns Dean that if Sam completes the trials, he will die, and then offers to hear Castiel out if he truly wishes to return to Heaven. As they can't confirm her claims, Castiel refuses to believe her, though Dean does and ultimately stops Sam from completing the trials. Naomi is later found collapsed on her desk in her \\"office\\" in Heaven, Metatron having gotten free and stabbed her in the head with her own drill off-screen. Metatron taunts Castiel that she had been telling the truth, and then completes his plan. Naomi is confirmed dead through dialogue in the episode \\"I'm No Angel\\" in the ninth season. In season 13's \\"Funeralia\\", Castiel returns to Heaven for help on finding the still living Gabriel and fighting the invading Alternate Michael, only to find Naomi alive. Naomi explains that she survived Metatron's attack, but her injuries were such that she had the word spread that she was dead. Even after nearly five years to put her thoughts back together in her skull as she puts it, Naomi is still only \\"mostly here.\\" However, her presence is needed since there are now less than a dozen angels left alive, Naomi and Castiel included. Displaying a vastly different personality, Naomi explains to Castiel that the surviving angels will soon burn out and Heaven will crumble if something doesn't change. As a result, the angels can't leave Heaven without risking this happening. The angels only chance is for Gabriel to return as his power can stabilize Heaven. If he can't be found, when Heaven crumbles, all of the souls will be released upon the Earth as ghosts. Now allies, Naomi accompanies Castiel back to Earth and promises that the remaining angels will keep Heaven going for as long as they can if he can't find Gabriel, but expresses a belief that maybe the situation can't be fixed. As she returns to Heaven, Naomi seals the portal behind her until the situation is resolved one way or another. During the season 14's \\"Byzantium\\", she appears again where she meets Castiel and Dumah in Jack's Heaven after he dies and ascends. She explains to Castiel that Jack left and a threat is invading Heaven while defeating the angels. Naomi elaborates on it being The Shadow (the entity that rules The Empty) and reveals that she knows Castiel meeting it since he is the only angel to ever escape the realm. Naomi states The Shadow wants Jack because it believes he belongs in its domain, she considered giving into its demands since Heaven would crumble if they didn't. When Castiel refused, she tried to plead to her brother but The Shadow possessed her and she implored to her siblings to run. Later on, Naomi meets Castiel again after he made a deal with The Shadow and left. She is seen unharmed from the attack and thanks him for his role even if he didn't do it for Heaven. As a reward, she tells Castiel the location of Alternate Michael. In \\"Absence,\\" Castiel attempts to contact Naomi, but gets Dumah instead who claims that Naomi is unavailable. In \\"Jack in the Box,\\" Castiel returns to Heaven where Dumah reveals that she overthrew Naomi following the Shadow's invasion of Heaven and has locked Naomi in a very small cell. Dumah begins manipulating Jack to solidify her own power and establish a reign of terror, but is killed by Castiel when she threatens the shared Heaven of John and Mary Winchester. Following Dumah's death, it is unclear if Naomi regained control of Heaven again. =Raphael= Raphael is the archangel assigned to protecting Chuck Shurley. Raphael appears to protect Chuck twice, in \\"The Monster at the End of the Book\\", when he is in the presence of Lilith, and in \\"Lucifer Rising\\", where he kills Castiel as he and Dean attempt to prevent Lucifer's rise. He is summoned and subsequently trapped by Dean and a resurrected Castiel in the fifth-season episode \\"Free to Be Me and You\\", but refuses to cooperate when they demand to know the location of God, only saying that he believes that God is dead. Dean and Castiel leave Raphael trapped despite his threat to hunt Castiel down when he escapes. In this episode, Raphael appears for the first time in a bodily vessel and is played by actor Demore Barnes, who reprises the role in \\"The Third Man\\" and \\"The Man Who Would Be King\\". Following the prevention of the Apocalypse, Raphael and his supporters are at war with Castiel and his followers over Castiel's opposition to Raphael's plan to free Lucifer and Michael to restart the Apocalypse. He makes his second on-screen appearance in the sixth-season episode \\"The Third Man\\", in which he and his soldiers are in close pursuit of Castiel. Raphael overpowers Castiel and is about to kill him when Balthazar intervenes and irrevocably destroys Raphael's vessel with one of Heaven's weapons, saving Castiel's life. Raphael is forced to search for a new vessel, eventually possessing a woman played by Lanette Ware. In \\"The French Mistake\\", he sends the angel hitman Virgil after Castiel's allies, including the Winchesters. Balthazar transports the brothers to an alternate universe with a key to where Heaven's weapons are stored and Virgil follows. This is revealed to have been a ploy by Balthazar and Castiel, allowing the latter time to retrieve the weapons. Now equipped with the weapons, Castiel forces Raphael to flee when the latter is poised to kill a returned Sam and Dean. Flashbacks in \\"The Man Who Would Be King\\" depicts the background to Raphael's war with Castiel; Raphael believed that the Apocalypse was destined to happen and informed Castiel of his intention to release Lucifer and Michael from the cage, giving Castiel the ultimatum to submit or die. Having forged a deal with the demon Crowley, Castiel attacked Raphael and declared war in Heaven. In the season six finale, \\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\\", Castiel reneges on his deal with Crowley, who turns to Raphael. Crowley agrees to open Purgatory for Raphael in exchange for his safety. However their ritual fails whilst Castiel opens Purgatory for himself. Castiel appears, now more powerful than ever, and obliterates Raphael with a snap of his fingers. In \\"We Happy Few\\", when discussing how they will defeat the Darkness, God tells the Winchesters that he can't resurrect Raphael or Gabriel as they are beings of primordial creation and will take too long to bring back. =Samandriel= Samandriel, called Alfie for short, portrayed by Tyler Johnston, is an angel who seems to hold humanity in higher regard than most angels and appears to hold Castiel in great regard as well. He appears at Plutus' auction in \\"What's Up, Tiger Mommy?\\" to bid for the demon Word of God tablet, taking the vessel of a young man named Alfie. He asks Dean about Castiel and is noticeably saddened that Castiel didn't make it out of Purgatory. Samandriel indicates that he supports Castiel and tells Dean that he thinks Castiel's problem is he has too much heart. Samandriel bids for the Word of God, but loses. After Mrs. Tran wins by bidding her soul, Samandriel approaches her to offer angelic protection to Kevin, but she refuses which he respects. In \\"A Little Slice of Kevin,\\" Samandriel has been captured by Crowley who tortures him for the names of all future Prophets with an angel sword. Samandriel breaks under the torture and tells him all the names, but Crowley is not satisfied until Samandriel reveals that the next generation of Prophets haven't been born yet and thus there are no more. Crowley stops the torture without urgency and orders Samandriel put \\"on ice\\" for future torture, believing he can get more out of him. In \\"Torn and Frayed,\\" Samandriel manages to push a spike out of his head that is blocking his connection to the other angels and sends a distress signal to Naomi. However, the demon Viggor discovers him and replaces the spike and starts torturing him again using headgear that puts a lot of spikes into Samandriel's head. The spikes cause Samandriel to revert to \\"factory settings\\" and he starts speaking in Enochian, in his distress speaking through a bush that catches fire. Viggor summons Crowley who tortures Samandriel personally to see what he can get from him when he's at \\"factory settings.\\" As Sam, Dean and Castiel launch a rescue, Samandriel starts talking about the Word of God tablets and just before they manage to break into the room, Samandriel reveals that there is an angel tablet. As Sam and Dean kill Viggor and another demon, Castiel removes the headgear from Samandriel, returning him to normal and takes him outside. Fearful of what he has revealed, Samandriel begs Castiel not to take him back to Heaven and warns Castiel that \\"they\\" are controlling them both. Before Samandriel can elaborate, Naomi orders Castiel to kill him for being a traitor. With no other choice, Castiel stabs Samandriel with his angel sword, killing him. Naomi has Castiel take Samandriel's body to Heaven so she can determine just how much he broke and explains that he is a traitor as he revealed the existence of the angel tablet which any angel would die to protect as it could cause great harm if it fell into demon hands. =Tessa= Tessa is a reaper who guides the deceased to the afterlife. She is portrayed by Lindsey McKeon. Following the car accident in the first-season finale, Dean is critically wounded and his soul leaves his body. Dean attempts to save other souls and defends himself from a reaper. The reaper then returns in the form of Tessa, posing as a coma patient. She attempts to convince Dean to move on but, as he considers this, Azazel intervenes as part of his deal with John Winchester and possesses Tessa to restore Dean to life, although Dean remembers none of this. In the season four episode \\"Death Takes a Holiday\\", she continues the work of a local reaper who has gone missing. After restoring Dean's memories of her with a kiss, she assists the brothers and agrees not to reap the souls for the duration. She is kidnapped by Alastair as part of a ritual to unlock a seal, but Dean and Sam rescue her. After getting Dean to help her have a young boy named Cole move on from being a ghost, she warns Dean that the angels are not looking for his best interest and to trust his own instincts. In \\"Appointment in Samarra\\", Dean summons Tessa during an out- of-body experience and asks her to call Death. Although she refuses, Death arrives on his own accord. Subsequently, Tessa guides Dean in his role as Death for 24 hours as part of a wager made with the Horseman in order to retrieve Sam's soul. Tessa returns in \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" where she is a part of Castiel's faction to retake Heaven. She has grown depressed over the fact that she can no longer ferry souls to Heaven due to it being closed and that she can hear their cries for help and is brainwashed by Metatron into acting as a suicide bomber for him, supposedly under Castiel's instruction in order to unite all the angels under his command. Tessa is found and captured by Dean before she can do this and her \\"bomb\\" is defused. Dean questions Tessa who, under her brainwashing, insists she is doing it for Castiel. When Dean pulls the First Blade on her, Tessa commits suicide by impaling herself on the Blade while Dean is holding it, thanking him at the same time. Her method of suicide makes it appear that Dean murdered her and helps turn Castiel's followers against him. =Uriel= =Zachariah= References Lists of American drama television series characters Lists of action television characters Lists of fantasy television characters Angels in television Purgatory in fiction ","title":"List of angels in Supernatural"},{"id":"59999620","text":"Dictyonota is a genus of lace bugs in the family Tingidae.

History and mission The institution started as Zungeru College of Advanced Studies (ZUCAS). The state government established ZUCAS with the 1979 Niger State Edict No. 7, although it actually began functioning on 10 January 1977 at a temporary site at Government College, Bida. In September 1984 the institution moved to its permanent site located midway between Zungeru and Wushishi. The original objectives of the college was to provide basic remedial studies for the purpose of preparing students for university entry requirements, and offering courses at the sub-degree level. The 6-3-3-4 System of Education in Nigeria necessitated a re-definition and re-orientation of the position of the Schools of Basic Studies and Colleges of Advanced Studies. In realization of this, the Niger State government through Cabinet Conclusion No. C 4(11) of December 1990, approved the conversion of ZUCAS into Niger State Polytechnic, Zungeru. Subsequently, Niger State Edict No. 9 of 1991 was enacted with effect from 1 October 1991 to back up the conversion. The Polytechnic now operates a collegiate system with two main campuses: the College of Science and Technology (CST) in Zungeru, and the College of Administrative and Business Studies (CABS) in Bida.

The film was adapted from the short story \\"Chicago After Midnight\\" by Edna Mae Baker. Among its stars are Ethel Moses, a Micheaux regular, and Oscar Polk, best known for his appearance in Gone with the Wind two years later.  Plot  The film opens at an all-black college somewhere in the Southern United States. Paul Bronson, a recent graduate, is convinced by gambler LeRoy Giles to join him in Chicago. There, Paul becomes involved with Dinah Jackson, a singer who is married to club owner Sam Brown but has been having an affair with LeRoy. Paul runs into Evelyn Martin, a beauty parlor owner, who recognizes him from college. The two have lunch together, during which LeRoy spots them and reports to Dinah that Paul is seeing someone else. Dinah arranges for LeRoy to drug and rob Paul. LeRoy also kills Sam and leaves the gun by his body. Paul finds the body; as he picks up the gun, Dinah enters and accuses Paul of killing Sam. Eventually, Dinah reports Paul to the police for the murder; she then goes on a bender and dies when her car is hit by a train. It seems that Paul will be found guilty of Sam's murder, until, at the last moment, a Chinese man named Ching Li comes forward as an eyewitness. Paul is freed and reunited with Evelyn. The two plan to travel by train to Oklahoma to start over together.

He is currently head chef of Tickets, a Michelin one-star restaurant in Barcelona and was formerly the head pastry chef of elBulli, in Roses on the Costa Brava. He was the Lead of vanguard kitchen inspiring many chefs around the world and the main reason for elBulli‚Äôs success. He has often collaborated with his brother, renowned chef Ferran Adri√†.  Biography  Albert Adri√†'s interest in cuisine first began thanks to his parents, Gin√©s and Josefa, but it was his brother Ferran who inspired him to explore food as a career. In 1985, he left his studies to begin working at elBulli. After two years of apprenticeship, he started to focus his interest on p√¢tisserie. He completed his education in various p√¢tisseries alongside great pastry chefs such as Antoni Escrib√† and Francisco Torreblanca. In late 1998, he began working on a creativity workshop at the headquarters of Bullicatering. The Bullitaller consisted of a table, some books and two chairs, one for him and the other for Oriol Castro. The workshop quickly gained in importance for the creative development of elBulli, so it moved to a new location in the centre of Barcelona. Until 2008, Albert Adri√† worked as the director of the Bullitaller and was responsible for desserts at elBulli. In March 2006, Adri√† opened Inopia Classic Bar in Barcelona, a bar serving modernised traditional tapas. Many identify Inopia as the first gastrobar in Spain. In 2009, he released his second solo book, Natura, and directed the documentary Un d√≠a en El Bulli, which won awards at several festivals. In July 2010, he left the Inopia bar, which would be renamed Lolita taperia, to concentrate on his new project, Tickets. In January 2011, he opened 41¬∫, located on Avinguda del Paral¬∑lel in Barcelona, which operated both as a cocktail bar and later as a 16-seat restaurant only open in the evening, with a tasting menu and cocktails. At the same time, he launched Tickets alongside his brother Ferran and the Iglesias brothers, the owners of the Barcelona seafood restaurant R√≠as de Galicia. In 2013, Albert Adri√† opened Pakta, a nikkei (Peruvian-Japanese fusion cuisine) restaurant on Carrer de Lleida (Poble Sec, Barcelona). In September 2013, Adri√†'s fourth concept opened, Bodega 1900, a vermouth bar where ap√©ritifs are the crux of a menu for diners seated at tables or at the bar, located on Carrer Tamarit in Barcelona, just in front of Tickets. In November of the same year, he published his third book, Tapas. La cocina del Tickets. From 2013, Constructing Albert was filmed, a documentary exploring Adri√†'s life as an inventive chef and businessman throughout the creation of his various gastronomic concepts and personal projects. In 2014, he opened a double restaurant, Ni√±o viejo, a Mexican street food taquer√≠a, and Hoja Santa, a gourmet Mexican restaurant on Avinguda Mistral in Barcelona. In February 2015, Albert and his brother Ferran partnered with Cirque du Soleil for their Heart project, a multi-purpose space in Ibiza uniting art, gastronomy and music. In 2015, he founded La Cala Albert Adri√†, a company specialised in selected ap√©ritif products. In February 2015, Adri√† arrived in London with his team for a 50-day residency at the iconic Hotel Caf√© Royal, 50 Days by Albert Adri√†, where he adapted local products and dishes to his personal style.

She married George Stanhope in 1777. The painting was begun the same year,Fredericksen, p. 100 and was exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, the following year. It is in good condition, although the varnish is discolored in places. Description Anne is shown full-length, sitting in an outside setting, facing to her left with her legs crossed, apparently lost in thought. She leans on the stone balustrade of a terrace, while a stairway behind her leads down into the garden.Impelluso, p. 282 She is dressed in the height of contemporary fashion, including a beige translucent shawl with gold fringe trimmings, and white slippers. Her hair is swept or brushed upwards, in the fashion of the day. He blue and white silk grownBrewer, p. 570 is low-cut and off-shoulder. The painting is divided vertically into two halves; behind Anne is dense, enclosed foliage, to her right is an open, unobstructed vista of her husband's estate, with a large view of a cloudy sky. Gainsborough describes the scene with loose and broadly applied brush-strokes, which according to the Getty, convey \\"a sense of immediacy in the large sweeping brushstrokes used to describe material, foliage, and background sky. Short, curved brushstrokes form the tree trunk, while longer strokes of blue and white paint create an illusion of shimmering, rustling fabric. Small dabs of white and gold paint applied to the shawl lend it a rich, glimmering effect.\\" A portrait of her husband, Philip, was completed at the same time and was a companion piece until 1959, when Anne's portrait was sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum. The husband is shown facing to the right and leaning against a tree, wearing a scarlet coat, tan breeches and black knee-length riding boots, and holding a stick and black hat in his left hand. He is attended by his brown and white dog. Gainsborough made two small, bust-length painted studies of Anne during the sitting; one later in the Thistlewayte's family collection in Southwick Park, Hampshire, the other later in the Shirley collection of the Lough Fea estate in County Monaghan, Ireland, until it was sold to a private collection in 2011 for ¬£205,250.

It is an expansion of a popular essay the two wrote for The Atlantic in 2015. Lukianoff and Haidt argue that overprotection is having a negative effect on university students and that the use of ‚Äútrigger warnings‚Äù and ‚Äúsafe spaces‚Äù does more harm than good. Overview Lukianoff and Haidt argue that many problems on campus have their origins in three \\"great untruths\\" that have become prominent in education: \\"What doesn‚Äôt kill you makes you weaker\\"; \\"always trust your feelings\\"; and \\"life is a battle between good people and evil people\\". The authors state that these three \\"great untruths\\" contradict modern psychology and ancient wisdom from many cultures. The book goes on to discuss microaggressions, identity politics, \\"safetyism\\", call-out culture, and intersectionality. The authors define safetyism as a culture or belief system in which safety (which includes \\"emotional safety\\") has become a sacred value, which means that people become unwilling to make trade-offs demanded by other practical and moral concerns. They argue that embracing the culture of safetyism has interfered with young people‚Äôs social, emotional, and intellectual development. Continuing on to discuss contemporary partisanship or the \\"rising political polarization and cross party animosity\\", they state that the left and right are \\"locked into a game of mutual provocation and reciprocal outrage\\". The authors call on university and college administrators to identify with freedom of inquiry by endorsing the Chicago principles on free speech through which university and colleges notify students in advance that they do not support the use of trigger warnings or safe spaces. They suggest specific programs, such as LetGrow, Lenore Skenazy's Free Range Kids, teaching children mindfulness and the basics of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). They encourage a charitable approach to the interpretations of other peoples' statements instead of assuming they meant offense. In their conclusion, the authors write that there will be positive changes in the near future as small groups of universities \\"develop a different sort of academic culture‚Äîone that finds ways to make students from all identity groups feel welcome without using the divisive methods.\\" They say that \\"market forces will take care of the rest\\" as \\"applications and enrollment\\" surge at these schools. Release The book reached number eight on The New York Times hardcover nonfiction best-sellers list. It spent four weeks on the list. Reception Edward Luce of the Financial Times praised the book, saying the authors \\"do a great job of showing how 'safetyism' is cramping young minds.\\" Writing for The New York Times, Thomas Chatterton Williams praised the book's explanations and analysis of recent college campus trends as \\"compelling\\". Writing for The Washington Post, Michael S. Roth, president of Wesleyan University, gave the book a mixed review, questioning the book's assertion that students today are \\"disempowered because they‚Äôve been convinced they are fragile\\". Roth however said that the authors' \\"insights on the dangers of creating habits of \\"moral dependency\\" are timely and important\\". Moira Weigel, writing for The Guardian, says that Lukianoff and Haidt, who live in safe spaces of Ted Talks and think tanks, where they are \\"genteel crusaders\\" against political correctness, and who have not experienced \\"discrimination and domination\\" themselves, \\"insist that the crises moving young people to action are all in their heads\\". The authors say that the students suffer from pathological cognitive distortions that fuel their activism and can be corrected by using self-help methods the authors provide based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). She says that the authors have created their own speech codes, which includes the cant of progress.

This example corresponds to the 2-comparable set {(1,1,1), (1,3,3), (2,1,2), (2,4,3), (3,1,4), (3,4,5), (4,2,1), (4,5,3), (5,2,2), (5,3,4), (5,5,5)}. In combinatorics, tripod packing is a problem of finding many disjoint tripods in a three-dimensional grid, where a tripod is an infinite polycube, the union of the grid cubes along three positive axis-aligned rays with a shared apex. Several problems of tiling and packing tripods and related shapes were formulated in 1967 by Sherman K. Stein. Stein originally called the tripods of this problem \\"semicrosses\\", and they were also called Stein corners by Solomon W. Golomb. The problem can also be formulated in terms of finding 2-comparable sets of triples, of filling matrices with monotone values, or of finding compatible sets of triangles in a convex polygon. The best lower bound known for the number of tripods that can have their apexes packed into an n\\\\times n\\\\times n grid is \\\\Omega(n^{1.546}), and the best upper bound is O\\\\bigl(n^2/\\\\exp O(\\\\log^* n)\\\\bigr). Equivalent problems The coordinates (x_i,y_i,z_i) of the apexes of a solution to the tripod problem form a 2-comparable sets of triples, where two triples are defined as being 2-comparable if there are either at least two coordinates where one triple is smaller than the other, or at least two coordinates where one triple is larger than the other. This condition ensures that the tripods defined from these triples do not have intersecting rays. Another equivalent two-dimensional version of the question asks how many cells of an n\\\\times n array of square cells (indexed from 1 to n) can be filled in by the numbers from 1 to n in such a way that the non-empty cells of each row and each column of the array form strictly increasing sequences of numbers, and the positions holding each value i form a monotone chain within the array. A collection of disjoint tripods with apexes (x_i,y_i,z_i) can be transformed into an array of this type by placing the number z_i in array cell (x_i,y_i) and vice versa. The problem is also equivalent to finding as many triangles as possible among the vertices of a convex polygon, such that no two triangles that share a vertex have nested angles at that vertex. This triangle-counting problem was posed by Peter Bra√ü and its equivalence to tripod packing was observed by Aronov et al. Lower bounds It is straightforward to find a solution to the tripod packing problem with \\\\Omega(n^{3/2}) tripods. For instance, for k=\\\\lfloor\\\\sqrt{n}\\\\rfloor, the \\\\Omega(n^{3/2}) triples :\\\\bigl\\\\\\\\{ (ak+b+1,bk+c+1,ak+c+1) \\\\big a,b,c\\\\in[0,k-1]\\\\bigr\\\\\\\\} are 2-comparable. After several earlier improvements to this na√Øve bound, Gowers and Long found solutions to the tripod problem of cardinality \\\\Omega(n^{1.546}). Upper bounds From any solution to the tripod packing problem, one can derive a balanced tripartite graph whose vertices are three copies of the numbers from 0 to n-1 (one for each of the three coordinates) with a triangle of edges connecting the three vertices corresponding to the coordinates of the apex of each tripod. There are no other triangles in these graphs (they are locally linear graphs) because any other triangle would lead to a violation of 2-comparability. Therefore, by the known upper bounds to the Ruzsa‚ÄìSzemer√©di problem (one version of which is to find the maximum density of edges in a balanced tripartite locally linear graph), the maximum number of disjoint tripods that can be packed in an n\\\\times n\\\\times n grid is o(n^2), and more precisely O\\\\bigl(n^2/\\\\exp O(\\\\log^* n)\\\\bigr). Although Tiskin writes that \\"tighter analysis of the parameters\\" can produce a bound that is less than quadratic by a polylogarithmic factor, he does not supply details and his proof that the number is o(n^2) uses only the same techniques that are known for the Ruzsa‚ÄìSzemer√©di problem, so this stronger claim appears to be a mistake. An argument of Dean Hickerson shows that, because tripods cannot pack space with constant density, the same is true for analogous problems in higher dimensions. Small instances For small instances of the tripod problem, the exact solution is known. The numbers of tripods that can be packed into an n\\\\times n\\\\times n cube, for n\\\\le 11, are: :1, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 19, 23, 28, 32, 38, ...

Biography Elgin Bryce Holt was born in Harrison, Arkansas, the sixth of Lydia Elizabeth (n√©e Ryan) and \\"Judge\\" Isham Right Holt's eight children. In 1879, the family moved to a homestead raising cattle along the San Francisco river near Alma, New Mexico. In 1892, the family moved to Las Cruces, New Mexico, allowing the four youngest children to attend the New Mexico Agricultural College. Very successful in mining silver in Mexico, he was known as the \\"Silver King of Sonora\\". A member of the American Institute of Mining Engineers and the American Association of Engineers, Holt died in Los Angeles, California and is buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery. =Education= In 1897, Holt was a member of the fourth graduating class of the New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (now New Mexico State University) having completed the Mining Engineering course. He earned degrees in Geology and Mineralogy. His senior thesis was entitled \\"The Potassium Cyanide Method of the Determination of Copper\\". During his senior year Holt was manager of the college football team and editor-in-chief of the New Mexico Collegian in 1897, the college student newspaper. Early career Advertisement for Zach Mulhall's Congress of Rough Riders and Ropers - 1903 World's Fair BulletinIn 1903, Holt and a former classmate W. C. Mossman, left for the 1903 World's Fair at St. Louis, Missouri to join Zach Mulhall's Congress of Rough Riders and Ropers in the show's \\"broncho riding act\\". Holt began his career renting his father's cattle business, working the family herd with his brother Isham for six years. During that time, Holt completed a post- graduate course in assaying. Holt's older brother Ernest had a number of mining interests in Sonora, Mexico but was killed in 1900 by a revolver that was said to have fallen from his cot and exploded. Holt sold his cattle and traveled to Sonora, Mexico in 1902 to investigate his brother's mining holdings, which had passed to the Yaqui Gold Company. After serving as Deputy Sheriff of Cochise County, Arizona in 1903 and 1904, Holt traveled to Santa Ana, Sonora, Mexico in June, 1905. Mining career In 1909 Holt and his brother Walter formed the Holt Bros. Mining Engineers company in Magdalena. They also operated an assay office in the same location, allowing them to hear about developments in the mining regions of Sonora. The brothers prospected for themselves. They made a rich strike of silver at the Compania mine west of Noria Station. The three inch vein of ore was said to be 30% silver. They also managed mining operations at a number of area mines, including the Sierra Prieta copper mine in Magdalena. In 1909 Holt also served as superintendent and general manager of the Cabrillo Mining company, located 30 miles west of Estacion Llano in Sonora, Mexico. Holt had \\"discovered and taken charge\\" of the property in 1907. He ran a tunnel under the \\"antigua patio process\\" mine that had played out and discovered chloride silver ore that ran as high as 600 ounces per ton. The property had suffered from a lack of water necessary to mine. Holt sank a 50' well shaft, providing all necessary water for the project. In 1911, Holt incorporated the Arizona-Sonora Mines Company in Nogales, Arizona to manage a high quality gold strike at the Juan Cabral mining property near Tucabe, Magdalena. Holt's listed address was Magdalena, Sonora, Mexico. Silver mining success Walter Holt, Elgin Holt, James Campbell Besley at Wells Fargo office, Estacion Llano, Sonora, MexicoThe Holt brothers met James Campbell Besley, a mine broker from nearby Hermosillo. In 1909 Besley had sold the Cerro de Plata mine, located in Sonora, Mexico, 25 miles southwest of Nogales to a group of Kentucky investors. After two years of disappointing results, the investors had asked Besley to find a purchaser for the mine. Besley brokered a deal with the Holt brothers who purchased the 150 acre mine. Holt said he started the mine with an \\"absurdly small cash capital of $ 200\\", adding \\"we have made the mine literally pay its own way\\". In July 1912, Holt made a deal with Roy & Titcomb, Inc. of Nogales, Arizona to build a mill and cyanide plant for treatment of silver ore from the Cerro de Plata mine. Acting as general manager of the mine, Holt claimed \\"five hundred thousand dollars of silver is in plain sight at the Cerro de Plata mine\\". The mill was started November 5, 1912. Mine development and ore shipments continued until thirty one lots of high grade ore had been shipped, mostly in railcar loads, aggregating more than 1400 tons and averaging 117 ounces of silver to the ton. 26,000 ounces of fine silver in the form of bars and precipitates were shipped to the Selby Reduction & Refining Works, near San Francisco, California during the first five weeks' production. In one section the silver content of the ore was assayed as high as 150 ounces to the ton. Holt was soon shipping 25,000 ounces of silver a month. The success of Holt's operation resulted in his expanding the mine's processing capabilities, erecting a larger 100-ton mill and cyanide plant. In 1913, Holt and his brother Walter reorganized the US Cerro de Plata Mining Company, combining it with the Mexican corporation Cerro de Plata Mining Company S.A.. James Campbell Besley, Roy & Titcomb, Inc. and Francis J. Hobson were named initial stockholders of the new corporation. Mexican revolutionaries stopped Holt on March 10, 1913 while he was transporting silver bullion from the mine to Nogales, Arizona. Traveling in an automobile under heavy guard, Holt was held up by 250 men. Holt and his party \\"were relieved of all arms and ammunition but otherwise unmolested, as the leader stated they did not want the bullion, only arms\\". A November 1913 newspaper article reported an 200% increase in net production receipts at the Cerro de Plata mine, growing from $ 7,000 realized in the month of October to an estimated monthly profit of $ 14,000 () from the production of \\"the little old dinky plant now in use\\". The article mentioned plans of doubling the production capacity at the mine. Caricature of E B Holt portraying him as the \\"Silver King of Mexico\\"In 1914, the Cerro de Plata mine was reported to be a \\"silver bonanza\\" and \\"one of the coming big bonanzas of Mexico\\". Holt was president and manager of the mine and his brother Walter was secretary and treasurer. Holt displayed 16,000 ounces of silver bullion taken from the Cerro de Plata mine in December of 1914. The bullion, estimated at the time being worth over $ 8,000 () was displayed in the window of the International drug store in Nogales, Arizona along with a silver \\"Savior on the cross\\" cast from the same refined silver ore. The display was taken to Phoenix, Arizona a week later, shown at the American Mining Congress. Holt was the delegate from Santa Cruz county, Arizona. By 1915, Holt was referred to as the \\"Silver King of Sonora\\". Holt claimed \\"during these (past) three years we have had a total production of nearly 700,000 ounces of silver\\" and \\"we already have 1,000,000 ounces of silver blocked out above the 300 foot level and will begin further sinking soon\\". In 1916, Holt was personally supervising the extraction of lead and silver ore from the Wandering Jew mine group in Santa Cruz County, Arizona. The ore was hauled by wagon to Patagonia, Arizona and shipped to El Paso, Texas for processing. Bandits, said to be Yaqui insurgents burned the Cerro de Plata Mining Company store in October 1916. They destroyed the company assaying office and shot at the company caretaker, killing his mule. Holt estimated the loss at $ 1,000. The ore tailing mill and cyanide plant were not damaged. It was reported Holt still owned silver mines in the Sonora area in 1920. Later career =Mine engineering consultant= In 1921, Holt was developing mining properties in San Luis Gonzaga, Sinaloa, Mexico. Holt was a director of the Mexican Metals Recovery Co., incorporated in Arizona in 1922. The company was headquartered in El Paso, Texas. In 1937 Holt held an option to develop the Mowry mine, located in Santa Cruz County, Arizona. =Arizona State mining engineer= Holt worked as a district mine engineer for the Arizona State Department of Mineral Resources. His initial assignment was to compile and codify rules and regulations regarding mining on the various federal and state classifications of land in Arizona. His reports on state mining activity were often printed as news stories in prominent newspapers. Holt was one of two of the state Department of Mineral Resources's four field engineers that lost funding in 1945 by a veto cast by Governor Sidney Preston Osborn during budget cuts. Amateur scientist =Anthropology= Elgin Bryce Holt, crossing the Sierras in Chihuahua, Mexico. Holt is the figure on left.Holt's article \\"Cliff Dwellers of the Mexican Sierra Madre\\" was published in the November, 1926 Bulletin of the Pan American Union. The article explored the greater part of the Sierra Madre from the Rio Aros, in the State of Chihuahua, to southwestern Durango, bordering the State of Nayarit. =Entomology= Holt reported a new type of ichneumon fly in the spring of 1896, a female example taken at Las Cruces, New Mexico. Named at the time Paniscus pulcher by the US Department of Agriculture, the insect was deemed a new species and described as being \\"very distinct in the entire lack of scutellar carinae and the highly contrasting color of the thorax\\". Holt collected an example of Gorytes hamatus, a sand fly at Las Cruces, New Mexico in 1896. His collected insect is listed in Contributions to the Entomology of New Mexico: Volume 1. Holt also provided the United States National Museum an example of a Dasymutilla Pseudopappas mutillidae wasp, taken in the Mesilla Valley of New Mexico in 1896. =Paleontology= Holt donated fossil and mineral specimens he had found in the Arizona and Mexican desert. Among them were \\"exceptionally choice samples of cassiterite (mineral tin oxide)\\" he found in Durango, Mexico and donated to the University of Nebraska Uni Museum in 1926. He donated fossil crocodile and phytosaur specimens to the American Museum of Natural History in 1936. He also donated Temnospondyli fossils found at St. Johns, Apache County, Arizona to the American Museum of Natural History. Death and burial Apparently despondent due to a long bout of ill health, Holt attempted suicide on October 5, 1945 by repeatedly hitting himself in the head with a hammer.

Twenge refers to this generation as the \\"iGen\\"; it is also known as Generation Z. Although she argues there are some positive trends, she expresses concern that the generation is being isolated by technology.  Content  In iGen, Jean Twenge examines the advantages, disadvantages and consequences of technology in the lives of the current generation of teens/young adults. She argues that generational divides are more prominent than ever and parents, educators and employers have a strong desire to understand the newer generation. Social media and texting have replaced many face-to-face social activities that older generations grew up with, therefore, iGeners are spending less time interacting in person. Twenge concludes this has led them to experience higher levels of anxiety, depression, and loneliness than seen in prior generations. She argues that use of technology is not the only thing that distinguishes iGeners from generations prior‚Äî the way in which their time is spent contributes to changes in their behaviors and attitudes toward religion, sexuality and politics. Twenge argues that iGeners' socialization skills and wants for the future have taken a turn towards an atypical, yet safe route. She elaborates on these topics throughout different chapters of the book. Each of these changes factor into her overall argument: that iGeners are unlike any generation seen before, and earlier generations must learn to understand them in order to keep up. With their new developmental ways, their impact will be unlike any before them. Her evaluations are based on four databases: Monitoring the Future, The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, The American Freshman Survey, and the General Social Survey. Each of these surveys asked iGeners quantitative and qualitative questions to determine if being raised synergistically with technology has made them less rebellious, more tolerant, less happy, less resilient to the challenge of adulthood, as Twenge asserts. In addition to the databases, Twenge conducted interviews with young adults across the country to collect first hand data about the challenges growing up with technology being presented to the current generation of teens and young adults. Reception Sonia Livingstone at the London School of Economics wrote that the book attracted \\"an avalanche of both eulogistic and critical reviews.\\" She was cautious about Twenge's findings, noting some graphs that did not fit them and suggesting other potential factors were at play. She did agree that there had been a recent downturn of mental health among the youth and concluded: \\"Let's hope the questions raised here foster more and better research about and with young people growing up in the digital age.\\"Book review: iGen: why today's super-connected kids are growing up less rebellious, more tolerant, less happy ‚Äì and completely unprepared for adulthood Marilyn Gates gave the book a positive review in the New York Journal of Books, calling it \\"an important barometer of youth mental health\\" and \\"a must-read for parents, teachers, employers, and anybody trying to make sense of iGen behavior and what this bodes for the future.\\" She described Twenge as a \\"highly skilled and empathetic interviewer\\" and also praised her writing for being easy to understand. She highlighted some flaws, such as data cherry-picked \\"for maximum shock value\\", correlation being treated as causation and that it did not entirely avoid \\"youth bashing\\". Annalisa Quinn at NPR was sceptical, arguing that the book was part of the familiar trend of older generations feeling superior to younger ones (\\"one of our great human traditions\\"). She was particularly critical of how Twenge \\"draws her conclusions first and then collects evidence that supports those conclusions, ignoring evidence that doesn't.\\" In the United Arab Emirates newspaper The National, Steve Donoghue said it drew alarmist conclusions despite data on the contrary: \\"Even Twenge's own charts and numbers, read with optimism, tend to indicate that members of iGen are generally far more socially aware, far less given to prejudice, and far, far sharper than their parents.\\" References Books about social psychology 2017 non-fiction books ","title":"IGen (book)"},{"id":"60000425","text":"Nell Murbarger (1909-1991) was an American author and reporter who was inducted in to the Nevada Writers Hall of Fame. Murbarger is perhaps best known for her many articles in Desert Magazine, where she popularized the hobby of \\" ghost-towning.\\"  Early life  Murbarger was born in North Dakota in 1909, to Harry C. (\\"Clem\\") and Bessie Nell (White) Lounsberry. Clem Lounsberry was an occasional newspaper reporter. Nell Murbarger's earliest writing for publication was at age ten. The family moved to California in 1923, where they picked fruit. In 1930, they settled in Costa Mesa, California. In the 1920s, Murbarger and her mother started the West Coast Curio Company, which sold seashells, urchins and gold-rush era relics. In 1931, Murbarger married W. Black Murbarger, an amateur archaeologist. She is credited with finding the first specimen of Lithophragma maximum a rare flowering plant found on San Clemente Island. The couple lived in Northern and Central California before they separated and were divorced in 1939.  Professional Career  In 1936, Murbarger was working for the Globe-Herald, the Costa Mesa weekly paper, where she eventually became editor. She left in 1939, but returned a few months later, joining the new Newport-Balboa Press as the local news editor from 1940-1945. After World War II ended, she retired from the newspaper business and devoted her efforts to freelance writing. She was a regular contributor to magazines such as Desert Magazine, Sunset, Arizona Magazine and True West Magazine. She also had articles published in newspapers such The Christian Science Monitor, The Salt Lake Tribune, and smaller papers.(part 2) Murbarger's first article in Desert Magazine appeared in 1949. Murbarger wrote under pen names such as Dean Conrad, Greta Joens, Dale Conroy, and Costa Mesa Slim. In Desert Magazine, she would sometimes have two articles, one under a pen name, the other under her real name. In 1950, she was offered an assistant editor position at Desert Magazine, which she declined so that she could continue her field work. In 1958, Desert Magazine was sold and Murbarger was limited to six articles a year. She received the American Association for State and Local History Award of Merit in 1955. In 1955, she received several awards from the California Association of Press Women. Her article \\"Josie Pearl, Prospector on Nevada's Black Rock Desert\\" received a first place for interviews, and her article about Fort Schellbourne received second prize for special feature articles. In addition, she took two other first prizes and a second prize for articles outside of Nevada. Her book \\"Ghosts of the Glory Trail\\" was awarded best nonfiction book of 1956 written by an American woman by the National Federation of Press Women. In 1963, Murbarger claimed that she had published over 1,000 articles about the western United States.  Later years  Murbarger's freelance career wound down in the 1960s. In the mid-1980s she sold the bulk of her photographic collection (about 10,000 images) to Nevada historian Stan Paher. The Costa Mesa Historical Society received her papers a few years later. In the late 1980s, she was living with her partner Ed Gueguen in a Costa Mesa bungalow that had the last of the inventory of the West Coast Curio Company. In 1989, Murbarger and Guegen moved to Guegen's family home in Lexington, Missouri. Murbarger died of Parkinson's disease there in 1991.

Maultsby Jr., and Richard J. Welsh, published in 1980. It describes a study of 260 individuals, 184 referred by the courts and 76 self-referred or referred by other agencies for 210 days. Participants were assigned randomly within five groups: AA-like meetings, RBT therapy administered by a non-professional, RBT therapy administered by degreed professionals, Insight Therapy administered by professionals, and a control group which received no treatment.  Methodology  The AA treatment meeting was created by the research team, and was held at a rented office building set up to run the overall study. The meeting was open to the public, but it is unknown whether the meeting was listed in local AA directories. While initially run by two AA members with over 10 years of experience before the trial started, the AA meeting was led by a member of the group (who was not in the study) with no previous AA experience during the research trial. Even though the AA patients were encouraged to get a sponsor, almost none of them got one. Attendance records were kept; people with poor or no AA attendance were reminded by a social worker about the conditions of their parole. Brandsma noted that the AA group \\"did not develop a high degree of cohesiveness\\".  Results  The study found that AA was more effective than no treatment, and about as effective as the three other alcoholism treatments. According to the study, both the AA- style and the lay-RBT group were able to stop drinking more often than the control group after one or two initial drinks, and when drinking, they both consumed three to four times less alcohol per day than the control group. = Increased binge drinking = While some people who went to the AA-like meetings indulged in binge drinking at the three-month after treatment mark, there was no increase in binge drinking for the AA-style meeting members six months, nine months, or one year after treatment. The fact that this study saw increased binge drinking has been noted in polemics critical of Alcoholics Anonymous.  Criticism  There was no effort to stop the people in the control group from attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. \\"The few randomized controlled trials of AA that have been conducted are significantly limited in their methods or interpretability [...] some alcoholism study subjects always go to AA on their own, even if not specifically assigned to go\\". The \\"Alcoholics Anonymous\\" treatment patients underwent in the Brandsma study did not use community Alcoholics Anonymous meetings; a later analysis says that there are \\"concerns with the Brandsma trial which call its experimental results into question\\" because \\"the control condition allowed for participation in actual AA meetings, while those in the AA condition attended a weekly AA-like meeting administered by the study (that was not an actual AA meeting)\\". Jeffrey Brandsma Jeffrey Brandsma, born on December 14, 1943, was the principal author of this study. He got a Ph.D. in clinical psychology, and was at the University of Kentucky Medical College as an Associate Professor when this study and book were published.

Supp. 3d 1 (D.D.C. 2019), was a case filed in December 2016 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia that reached its final resolution in February 2020, in which the ABA and four individual public interest lawyers (two of whom were former ABA employees) succeeded in preventing the United States Department of Education from denying individuals employed by certain \\"public service organizations\\" eligibility to participate in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. Following an initial victory on summary judgment for three of the individual plaintiffs in the district court's February 2019 ruling, the ABA and the fourth individual plaintiff settled the outstanding issues with the Department. As a result, the four individual plaintiffs and all employees of the ABA, as well as other similarly situated individuals, are eligible to participate in the PSLF program.  History  The PSLF program was created by law in 2007 and provided that anyone working full-time in eligible public service jobs could have the remaining balance of their student loans issued under the Federal Direct Student Loan Program forgiven after making 120 qualifying monthly payments. In 2008, the Department of Education issued a regulation defining the term \\"public service job\\" to include any full-time position at an eligible \\"public service organization,\\" including a federal, state, local, or Tribal government; a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization; and any other not-for- profit organization that provides any of a number of listed \\"public services,\\" including \\"public interest law services\\" and \\"public education,\\" among others. The ABA is a not-for-profit 501(c)(6) organization. Several ABA employees, including two who were individual plaintiffs in the case, worked on public interest law projects for the organization, such as assisting undocumented immigrants on the U.S. southern border and expanding access to justice for indigent individuals. After initially reviewing the Employment Certification Forms submitted by those employees, the Department of Education sent letters confirming that their ABA employment would qualify them for the PSLF program, provided that they continued to make monthly payments for the required 120-month period. Similarly, the remaining two individual plaintiffs, who worked for the not-for-profit 501(c)(6) American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) and not-for-profit 501(c)(19) Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA), provided public education services on issues related to immigration law and services to individuals with disabilities and the elderly (i.e., Vietnam War veterans), respectively; the Department likewise informed them that their employment qualified them for participation in PSLF. A few years later, however, the Department issued each of these individuals notices stating that their employment did not qualify for PSLF, that the prior approval notices had been issued in error, and that none of the payments made on their loans while employed by these organizations would count toward the 120-payment threshold. Following unsuccessful attempts by the ABA to resolve its dispute with the Department, the ABA and the four individual plaintiffs filed suit on December 20, 2016, seeking to force the Department to reinstate the plaintiffs' PSLF eligibility. The plaintiffs alleged that the Department had improperly changed its interpretations of the PSLF qualifying criteria as defined in the statute and regulation, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the plaintiffs' due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. The Department's primary arguments in defense were that the lawsuit was premature since none of the individuals in question had yet reached the 120-payment threshold that would allow them to apply for PSLF, and therefore that there had been no \\"final agency action\\" giving rise to an APA claim; and that the Department had not changed its interpretations but instead had merely corrected errors committed by its student loan servicer, which was responsible for administering the PSLF program. The Department also defended its denials by arguing that the ABA and the other organizations were not public service organizations because their \\"primary purpose\\" was not to provide one of the services listed in the regulation, and because AILA's public education services were not provided in a \\"school or school-like setting.\\"  Decision and outcome  In an opinion issued on February 22, 2019, Judge Timothy J. Kelly granted summary judgment in favor of three of the individual plaintiffs: the two former ABA employees and the AILA employee. Kelly rejected as \\"nonsense\\" the Department's argument that its denials did not amount to final agency action, finding that the legal and practical effects of the Department's denial notices were significant given the immense impact on the plaintiffs' ability to plan their careers and finances, even if they had not yet applied for final loan forgiveness. Kelly further determined that evidence produced by the plaintiffs demonstrated conclusively that the Department had created the \\"primary purpose\\" and \\"school-like setting\\" standards years after issuing its 2008 regulation and without providing any of the public notice required under the APA, thus rendering the changes arbitrary and capricious. As a result, he issued an order vacating those standards and remanding the denial notices to the Department for reconsideration in light of his opinion. Kelly denied summary judgment to the ABA as an organization and to the fourth individual plaintiff who had worked for VVA, finding that the evidence did not demonstrate that that plaintiff's denial had been based on a changed interpretation. The ABA and the fourth individual plaintiff commenced an appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. For its part, the Department declined to appeal the district court's ruling with respect to the three individual plaintiffs who had prevailed. Following a court-appointed mediation, the Department agreed to issue letters confirming that both the ABA and VVA are qualifying public service organizations for purposes of the PSLF program, and restored the fourth individual plaintiff's payment credits earned while at VVA. Ropes & Gray LLP partner Chong Park, who represented the plaintiffs, noted the \\"positive impact this has for [the] individual plaintiffs as well as other student loan borrowers in similar positions.\\" The practical effect of the outcome is that the Department is barred from applying the \\"primary purpose\\" or \\"school-like setting\\" standards when assessing the PSLF eligibility of any non-501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization.

Early life Baker was born in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on April 23, 1991. She has one younger sibling. She began her professional wrestling training in June 2014, when she enrolled in the International Wrestling Cartel training academy in South Hills, Pennsylvania. Professional wrestling career =Independent circuit (2015‚Äì2019)= Shimmer Volume 113 in April 2019 Baker made her professional wrestling debut at an International Wrestling Cartel (IWC) event in August 2015, competing alongside Andrew Palace against Dylan Bostic and Ray Lyn in a tag team match, where Baker and Palace were victorious. The following year, Baker appeared on WWE Raw as a jobber, losing to Nia Jax in a squash match. On December 10, 2016, Baker became the inaugural IWC Women's Champion when she defeated April Sera, Marti Belle, and Sonya Strong in a four-way elimination match. She was defeated by LuFisto for the title in July 2017. On September 1, 2018, she competed in a four corner survival match against Madison Rayne, Chelsea Green, and Tessa Blanchard at the All In pay-per-view event, which was won by Blanchard. Baker regained the IWC Women's Championship by defeating LuFisto and Ray Lyn in a three-way match in October, only to drop it again in November 2018 to Katie Arquette. =All Elite Wrestling (2019‚Äìpresent)= On January 2, 2019, it was reported that Baker had signed with newfound promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW), being the first female wrestler signed by the promotion. She made her debut for the promotion on May 25 at its inaugural pay-per-view, Double or Nothing, where she defeated Nyla Rose, Kylie Rae, and Awesome Kong in a fatal-four-way match. On July 13, she competed in a tag team match alongside Riho at Fight for the Fallen, where the two were defeated by Bea Priestley and Shoko Nakajima. Baker suffered a legitimate concussion due to a kick by Priestley during the match, which incited a storyline rivalry between the two. On August 31, Baker competed in the Women's Casino Battle Royale for an opportunity at the AEW Women's World Championship at the All Out pre-show, during which she eliminated Shazza McKenzie, ODB, Brandi Rhodes, Mercedes Martinez, and Priestley before she herself was eliminated by Rose. Baker went on to defeat Priestley in singles competition at the Full Gear pre- show on November 9. At Chris Jericho's Rock 'N' Wrestling Rager at Sea Part Deux: Second Wave, which aired on Dynamite on January 22, 2020, Baker turned heel after she berated commentator Tony Schiavone following her victory over Priscilla Kelly. In May, Baker injured her leg during a tag team match, in which she and Rose went on to defeat Hikaru Shida and Kris Statlander, later stating that she would return in a wrestling role in September at All Out. Baker then began a rivalry with Big Swole, which involved Swole abducting her and tossing her into a trash bin during an episode of Dynamite. In July, she underwent surgery on her nose to repair a deviated septum. At All Out, Baker lost to Big Swole in a Tooth and Nail match, which was taped at her dental office. Professional wrestling style and persona Baker's legitimate profession as a dentist was often referenced as part of her character in AEW, so much so that Pro Wrestling Torch observed that \\"it became a parody\\". The character was originally described as \\"happy\\", but following Baker's heel turn, it has been described as \\"too proud\\" and \\"delusional\\". She also began referring to herself as a \\"role model\\". In relation, Baker uses a fusion of a scissored armbar and the mandible claw, which attacks an opponent's mouth, as a finisher, named Lockjaw. The character is also friends with commentator Tony Schiavone and fellow wrestler Rebel. Personal life Baker studied behavioral medicine with a minor in human development and family studies at Pennsylvania State University. In 2014, she enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine, graduating in May 2018. In addition to working as a professional wrestler, Baker is employed at a private practice in Winter Park, Florida. In a 2019 interview for Bleacher Report, Baker commented on her ability to work in both dentistry and professional wrestling: Baker is in a relationship with fellow professional wrestler Adam Cole.

The film was adapted from Valdez's stage musical La Gran Carpa de los Rasquachis, which was also produced with El Teatro Campesino. El Corrido was aired on PBS on November 4, 1976 as part of its Ballad of a Farmworker television series. The film stars Felix Alvarez as Jesus Pelado Rasquachi, a young Mexican man who travels to the United States in search of work, suffering various unfortunate and comical events along the way.  Plot  The story begins with a young man named Beto (Daniel Valdez) questioning an old man with a guitar (Luis Valdez) about going to America to seek work, as they ride in a truck for the border. The old man decides to narrate the story of Jesus Pelado Rasquachi (Felix Alvarez) in order to show the young man what America is really like. Jesus Pelado Rasquachi finds himself unable to secure employment in the fictional Mexican town of Guangoche, and desires to migrate to the United States in search of a job. Due to his inability to pay a smuggler the fee for border crossing, he comes in contact with El Diablo (Jose Delgado), a mobster who he ends up borrowing money from. Even after borrowing the money Rasquachi is unable to cross the border due to his lack of both American money with which to bribe the guards or an American sponsor. Due to his lack of legal employment, Rasquachi is forced to work low-paying and difficult jobs at the behest of the smuggler who contracts him to various ranchers on the border near Ciudad Juarez. Rasquachi continues to work around the western area of the United States, poorly paid and subjected to poor working conditions before finally ending up in an area resembling Los Angeles, where he dies an old man, having met death (Socorro Cruz). The old man finishes his story and mysteriously disappears, when Beto is accosted by a series of farm workers who demand to know the story of Jesus Pelado Rasquachi. Beto then tells the story himself, leading the crowd away as the old man wanders down the road towards America.  Cast  Felix Alvarez as Jesus Pelado Rasquachi * Lily Alvarez as Rasquachi's Wife * Daniel Valdez as Beto * Luis Valdez as Old Narrator * Jose Delgado as El Diablo and Truck Driver * Socorro Cruz as Death and Foreman  Production  El Corridor was first produced as a stage musical with El Teatro Campesino as La gran Carpa de los RasquachisI. Valdez made many revisions to the story of El Corrido over the 60's and 70's, before culminating in his most polished version of the play. Valdez was known for the musical style known as corrido, a narrative form of storytelling that heavily incorporated Mexican folk music and rhythm, which he incorporated into the musical. When adapting the play for PBS, Valdez had to shorten the musical for its PBS adaptation, El Corrido. Part of the film was taped as a stage production.  Style  Luis Valdez and El Teatro Campesino were known for their use of corrido in conjunction with the Mexican carpa (Comedic shows usually arranged out of tents) to portray modern life for farm-workers and migrants. While El Corrido is a comedy like most carpa's, El Corrido was especially known for its usage of supernatural elements and very dark humor to establish morality and spiritual conflict El Teatro Campesino was also notable for their use of actual migrants in their plays, they often cast family members and nearby workers in order to maintain authenticity in their work.

It was soft launched on February 18, 2019 and was officially launched on July 31, 2019, exclusively on satellite provider Cignal. One PH is the third MediaQuest channel launched under the One branding, along with the English-language news channel One News, cable sports channel One Sports+, free TV sports channel One Sports, and premium entertainment channel One Screen. One PH is a joint partnership of MVP Group's media properties Pilipino Star Ngayon, PM: Pang Masa, The Freeman, Banat, Radyo Singko 92.3 News FM and News5. History On January 13, 2019, AksyonTV was rebranded into all-sports network 5 Plus. With this move, Radyo5 programs that were simulcast on AksyonTV moved to the then- unnamed channel. Meanwhile, 5 Plus, which took over DWNB-TV's terrestrial (analog) TV space, moved to Cignal channel 15. However, on January 17, 2019, just 4 days after the move, the Radyo5 simulcast channel was reassigned from channel 6 to channel 1, temporarily replacing Cignal's community promotion channel. 5 Plus later took over channel 6, but remained simulcasting on channel 15 until February 17, 2019. On February 18, 2019, the same standalone channel was soft-launched as One PH, reverting its Cignal channel assignment back to channel 6. Alongside this, Radyo5 unveiled its new refurbished studios and new content were announced to be added to the program line-up of Radyo5 and One PH. On July 31, 2019, One PH, was formally launched by Cignal TV as a 24/7 all-Filipino news, public affairs and entertainment channel and are categorized into three (3) blocks: NewsKom (News Komentaryo/News Commentary), KKK (Katarungan, Karapatan at Kaalaman/Justice, Rights and Knowledge) and SnS (Showbiz and Sports). In August 2019, selected Radyo5 and One PH programs (Morning Calls, One Balita, One Balita Pilipinas, Wag Po! and Turbo Time with Mike and Lindy) begin its airing on either simulcast or delayed basis on 5 as part of programming revamp spearheaded by TV5 Network's new CEO Jane Basas. On March 8, 2020, One PH was given a slightly revamped look and reassigned to Cignal channel 1, replacing the community promotion channel, while One Sports (launched as a free-to-air channel replacing 5 Plus) was reassigned to channel 6. On March 17, 2020, One PH along with One News, temporarily suspended its regular programming as an effect of the Luzon-wide \\"enhanced community quarantine\\" against COVID-19. The news channel aired the special edition of One News Now. On May 22, 2020, One PH starts test transmissions on digital terrestrial television via DWET-TV subchannel 5.3. This development signifies the reinstatement of Radyo5's \\"RadyoVision\\" format on free-to-air television after its predecessor, AksyonTV carried over most of the radio station's programs from 2011 to 2019.https://www.facebook.com/DTVPilipinas/posts/4494098730615636 Programming Majority of its programming are sourced and simulcasted from Radyo5 92.3 News FM, a practice that was carried over from its predecessor AksyonTV, and following suit with other Mega Manila news radio stations (DZMM TeleRadyo, DZRH News Television, Inquirer 990 Television, Dobol B sa News TV block on GMA News TV and Radyo Bandido TV) and regional news radio stations (such as Brigada News TV in General Santos, DWNE TeleRadyo in Nueva Ecija, Tirad Pass Network in Ilocos Sur, and Bandera News TV in Palawan).

Biography Moreau was born in 1813 in Rochefort but was raised in Niort where her family settled. She started writing poetry at an early age. A local prefect M. de Saint-Georges, encouraged her and gave her letters of recommendation to study in Paris. She travelled there with her mother, and received a warm welcome, notably from Sophie Bawr, whose gratitude she wrote about when Bawr died in 1861. The first collection of Moreau's, Dreams of a Young Girl, was published in 1837, shortly after her arrival in Paris. On the death of √âlisa Guizot, in January 1833 √âlise Moreau wrote an elegy. Fran√ßois Guizot, then Minister of Education, encouraged her; as well as other luminaries of the time including Nodier, Chateaubriand, and Lamartine. She was sent to the Academie Francaise, to participate in a contest for the legacy of Moliere. She submitted a piece which did not win the prize, but it did give her wider notoriety. After some further publications such as A Destiny (scenes of the intimate life) and Memories of a little child, she married the poet Paulin Gagne, whose eccentric designs, translated into the most amazing styles, and caused more notoriety than she would have desired. In 1854 they founded a literary journal Le Th√©√¢tre du monde, which appeared from 1854 to 1857; she collaborated in each issue. Later in her life she became influenced by her husband's eccentric lifestyle as can be seen in the work Om√©gar. In this work, it was said that she was less Ms. Moreau and more Mme. Gagne. She and her husband spent the last years of their lives living in poverty. She died in 1861.

The series revolves around a radio that broadcasts only at night, in a small town deep inside Buenos Aires Province where all kinds of macabre and supernatural events occur.  Production  Production company Tangram Cine developed an indie-funded live-action pilot in 2009. Although it was severely promoted on their social sites, its post-production was never finished and the pilot never saw the light. It was written and directed by Cristian Ponce and Pedro Saieg. During the next eight years, the series mutated into different forms and was submitted to several development contests, either as a TV series project or as a feature film. In 2015, its creator, Cristian Ponce decided to go back to the project, but this time as an animated series. Teaming up with Hern√°n Bengoa (with whom he had worked on two seasons of webseries Policompa√±eros Motorizados), they gave birth to a new incarnation of the project that was now based in a classic anthological structure, in the style of Twilight Zone or Tales from the Crypt, only tied together by the intervention of its main character, The Host. The new version was produced by Tangram Cine and Decimu Labs, and was developed almost in its entirety by a four-person crew: Cristian Ponce (screenwriter, director and animator), Hern√°n Bengoa (screenwriter and illustrator), Hern√°n Biasotti (sound designer) and Marcelo Cataldo (original soundtrack). It features voice acting by Nicol√°s Van de Moortele, Casper Uncal, Mar√≠a Dupla√°, Letizia Bloisi, Ciro Herce, Milagros Molina and Jorge Alonso. The series consists of five episodes, originally released once every three months.  Style  The Kirlian Frequency takes several elements from classic fantastic films and TV series; for example, the midnight radio trope (The Fog, Night Visions, Pontypool as fiction examples; and Coast to Coast AM and _La Mano Peluda_ in real life); and the small town / big hell trope (Eerie, Indiana, IT, Gravity Falls or Scarfolk).  Netflix  Halfway through 2018, The Kirlian Frequency virtually disappeared from every video platform and social network. Only at the end of January 2019 was its return announced, this time on Netflix, newly dubbed in English and Portuguese for its international release.

Description Boronia tetrandra is an erect or spreading shrub that grows to a height of or higher with branches covered with long, spreading hairs. The leaves are pinnate with between five and thirteen or more well-spaced leaflets. The leaflets are linear, about long. The flowers are greenish cream to yellow or reddish brown, cup-shaped and arranged singly in leaf axils on a short pedicel. The four sepals are broad, hairy and often coloured. The four petals are long and overlap for most of their length. The eight stamens alternate in length with those nearest the sepals thick with large anthers and those near the petals curving towards the style and with minute anthers. The stigma has four lobes. Flowering occurs from May to October. Taxonomy and naming Boronia tetrandra was first formally described in 1805 by Jacques Labillardi√®re and the description was published in Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen.

Biography  She was born in Poland. Her father was a railway engineer and her mother was a pianist. In 1890, her father was transferred to St.Petersburg and she received her first art lessons from the Polish painter, Jan CiƒÖgli≈Ñski. Later, she took private lessons in Munich, from the Hungarian painter, Simon Holl√≥sy. She completed her studies in 1909 in Paris, at the Acad√©mie Ranson, where she worked with F√©lix Vallotton and Maurice Denis.D.O.

After a tour of Italy with him and a friend, she returned to Galicia and became involved in the local art community. She did, however, maintain contact with Boychuk and, in 1917, they were married in Kyiv. She learned Ukrainian and assimilated the culture quickly. They had a son in 1918. From 1919 to 1922, she worked at an art school in Mirgorod, then became head of the xylography workshop at the Kyiv Institute of Plastic Arts (after 1924, the Kyiv Art Institute, now the National Academy of Visual Arts and Architecture). She was there until 1929.. In 1936, she and her husband were arrested on charges of espionage and counterrevolutionary activities.

Early life and artwork  Early in his career as an artist in Chicago, Parish was part of a politically active group of African American artists in Chicago, some of whom were later part of the AfriCOBRA (African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists) group founded in 1968 by artists Wadsworth Jarrell and Jeff Donaldson, who both taught at Howard University.

Research work A microbiologist by training, his research interests lie with chronic lung diseases, primarily tuberculosis (TB), followed by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) diseases. He explores molecular events that govern host-pathogen interactions and the ability of mycobacteria to block the immune response to infection. Av-Gay‚Äôs research is geared towards the identification and characterization of novel drugs and drug targets in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.. His early work characterized and identified mycothiol (MSH) biosynthetic pathway in Mycobacteria. Mtb utilizes the glutathione‚Äôs (GSH) thiol analogs mycothiol and ergothioneine (EGT) to neutralize xenobiotics and free radicals. His research group further demonstrated that MSH is a key cytoprotectant in Mtb and EGT has a role in persistence and long-term infection of macrophages. Av-Gay‚Äôs most significant discovery was the identification and characterization of PtpA, a protein phosphatase in Mtb which inhibits the normal macrophage response to infection. Av-Gay authored over 100 peer review scientific publications, review articles, book chapters and 15 patents.

It is located at Boeslunde, between Kors√∏r and Sk√¶lsk√∏r, Slagelse Municipality, some 100 kilometres southwest of Copenhagen. Espe has been listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places since 1918. The main building dates to the 18th century but was adapted to the Late Neoclassical style in 1848. The manor and estate has been owned by members of the Moltke family since 1810. History The earliest history of the estate is unclear but it is known that the Crown ceded it to Johan Friis in exchange for other property in 1561. It is believed that it over the next period of time shared its ownership with Borreby. In 1667, Dorthe Daa sold it to the mayor of Sk√¶lsk√∏r, Anders Mogensen. It is assumed that it was later acquired by Anders Hansen, whose widow, Anne Marie Andersdatter, was the owner in 1689. In 1703, she ceded it to her son-in-law, Gerlach Thigillius, who in 1719 returned it to his mother-in-law. Im 1723, Anne Marie Andersdatter sold Espe to Mette Rosenkrantz. Mette Rosenkrantz died in 1730. Her heirs than sold the estate to Christian Frederik de Boysset, who just a few years later, in 1736, sold it to Poul Schnabel. In 1747, Espe changed hands again when it was sold to Friederich Lorentz von B√ºlow. He had also acquired the estate Bonderup. After Friederich Lorentz von B√ºlow's death, Espe and Bonderup were sold to Johan Ludvig Schwerman, who in 1758 sold them to Peder Christensen. In 1760, he sold Espe to Folmer Danchel. Folmer Danchel died in 1773. The new owner, Hans Thibi, committed suicide later that same year. In 1775, Espe was acquired by Morten Quistgaard. He was a member of the important 1786 Agriculture Commission where he opposed the abolition of stavnsb√•ndet. In 1In 1788, he ceded Espe to his son, Johan Rehling Quistgaard, who sold the estate in 1798. Over the next decade it changed hands three times more. In 1810, Espe was acquired by Otto Joachim Moltke. In 1825, he also purchased Bonderup. Moltke sold most of the tenant farms to the copyholders and constructed a new main building. He died in 1858. Espe and Bonderup then went to his son, Adam Gottlob Moltke, who was succeeded by his son Joachim Vilhelm Moltke in 1863. He died just five years later and his widow then managed the estate on behalf of their newborn son, Adam Gottlob Moltke. He ended up owning Espe for 90 years but for long periods of time lived elsewhere. After his death in 1958 , Espe went to Adam Moltke-Huitfeldt.

It was built in 1909 to shelter passengers waiting for cable cars on the James Street and Yesler Way lines. The pergola is located at the intersection of 1st Avenue and Yesler Way, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1977 alongside the adjacent Pioneer Building and totem pole. The structure originally included an underground public bathroom that was closed after the end of cable car service in the 1940s. After decades of deterioration, the pergola was restored by the city government in 1972 with an extensive renovation and dedicated as part of Pioneer Square plaza. It was rebuilt entirely in 2001 after the pergola was destroyed by a semi-truck collision, costing $3.4 million. The rebuilt pergola has since been reinforced and protected against future collisions, but has suffered damage in other incidents. Description and history Overhead view of the pergola, 1914 The Victorian-style, triangular structure was designed by Julian F. Everett, a local architect, and originally functioned as a comfort station. It measures long and high, supported by a series of iron columns. It featured ornate iron decorations, a glass roof, and an underground public bathroom that opened on September 23, 1909, at a cost of $24,000. The bathroom, one of the first underground facilities of its kind for Seattle, featured terrazzo floors, brass and nickel fixtures, and white Alaskan marble stalls. It had sixteen stalls for men and nine for women, and was described as the best and most lavish public restroom west of the Mississippi. Its inclusion was controversial at the time, having been deemed an unsightly addition to the park by The Seattle Times and community groups. As cable car service was cancelled and the area declined, the pergola deteriorated and was stripped for materials by the late 1940s. The bathroom itself was closed in 1948 in lieu of renovations. The pergola was restored in 1972 with a $100,000 donation from James E. Casey, who founded the United Parcel Service in Pioneer Square. Using the original blueprints to recreate the ornamental roof and light fixtures, restoration work began in July 1972 and was finished in February 1973 ahead of the formal dedication of the expanded Pioneer Square parkspace. The pergola's underground bathroom was left untouched by the renovation and was unsuccessfully proposed as an addition to the Seattle Underground Tour in the late 1990s. A similar pergola at Occidental Park was built in the 1970s and removed in 2006. The renovated pergola suffered accelerated deterioration that forced it to be closed and repaired in 1992 at a cost of $100,000, as bolts used during the restoration had rusted. It was accidentally destroyed on January 15, 2001, in a collision with a commercial semi-truck that clipped the structure while making a 90-degree turn. Owing to its status as a city landmark, the city government pledged to rebuild the pergola or build a new structure if restoration proved infeasible. The trucking company claimed full responsibility and funded $1 million towards the cost of rebuilding the pergola through its insurer. The pergola was rebuilt by Seidelhuber Iron and Bronze Works based on repaired sections rather than the original documents, at a cost of $3.4 million. While the project was originally planned to be finished in time for Christmas, the repair work required more time and was made more complicated by the February 2001 earthquake, which caused the roof of the underground restroom to sink by . The Seidelhuber foundry's owners financed the project's performance bond on their own, requiring them to sell their home and wedding rings. Installation of the restored pergola elements began in June 2002, using only one percent of new material for the exterior furnishings. The new pergola was fitted with a steel skeleton to prevent a future collapse; the twelve Corinthian columns and sixteen arches were rebuilt using iron from the original structure. The pergola was reopened on August 17, 2002, costing a total of $3.9 million. Due to repeated vehicle strikes, the city government installed structural poles and bollards to protect the pergola. The bollards stopped two semi-trucks in 2008 and 2012 and prevented further damage to the structure. It was struck twice in 2013 by a semi-truck and a hit-and-run driver who damaged the iron fencing around the structure. Seattle Seahawks fans celebrating the team's Super Bowl XLVIII victory in February 2014 climbed atop the pergola and broke twenty of the glass roof panes; Seahawks fans and private businesses later raised $25,000 through crowdfunding for repairs to the structure. In response, a temporary fence was installed around the pergola ahead of the team's appearance at the following Super Bowl in 2015.

Theophil von Salbenstein is a rich landowner and guardian of Hermine von Meyen who has just inherited a considerable fortune managed by him. A clause of the will, however, stipulates that in order to inherit the fortune, Hermine has either to wait for three years or to marry Salbenstein immediately. But Hermine is in love with the poet Ferdinand R√∂mer. Ferdinand, on the other hand, has just fled to the countryside, assuming his relationship with Hermine had ended. The poet dedicates his enthusiastic and romantic poetry to Lieschen, the daughter of the peasant Christian Berner. Barbara, a distant relative of Theophil, comes on the scene to resolve the imbroglio. She manages to show Theophil a written marriage agreement. At the end, everyone gets what he or she deserves.Dichter und Bauer, f-v-su.de  Plot summary based on Quedenfeldt's 1936 libretto  In the good old days of Emperor Franz Joseph's Habsburg Monarchy, the Hendelberg Marriage Market takes place every spring. Marriageable girls and fellow locals who love each other are married the same day in the chapel. Even the rich farmer Lugosch appears with his son Florian, because the old man plans to marry his simple-minded offspring with the proud Jelka, farmer Martin's daughter. However, Jelka is not in the least interested in Florian, and actually Florian is not into the idea, either, because his thoughts always revolve around the cute maid Julischka. However, the main point of contention between Lugosch and Martin is in reality the appropriation of the Steinerhof estate whose owner has recently passed away. While Lugosch wants to acquire the property for his son, Martin wishes that his ward Peter Werschitz, legitimate heir to the estate, become the new owner. But no one knows where Peter is and whether he still lives at all ‚Äì and in three days the legal deadline ends, after which the Steinerhof gets under the hammer ... Then, to the astonishment of the folks, it is learned that Julischka not so long ago served as a maid at a Peter Werschitz in Budapest. The excited questioning of the girl produces even more incredible news: Peter Werschitz should be a poet! Martin, Jelka and Julischka set off for Budapest to bring Peter back home. But before the lost son becomes a real master of the Steinhof estate and a successful writer, all kinds of weird and grotesque obstacles have to be overcome between the peasants and the townspeople. But finally ‚Äì without the marriage market ‚Äì the right kind of love will find each other and on the Steinerhof a young couple of happiness blossoms.Dichter und Bauer, score details, plot In popular culture Mickey Mouse conducts an orchestra of barnyard animals in playing the overture of Dichter und Bauer in the 1930 short The Barnyard Concert.

The Continental Divide is to the west. Like so many of the mountains in Kananaskis Country, Mount Jellicoe received its name from the persons and ships involved in the 1916 Battle of Jutland, the only major sea battle of the First World War.Battle of JutlandAlberta Historic Places History Mount Jellicoe was named in 1918 to honor Admiral of the Fleet John R. Jellicoe (1859‚Äì1935), the commander of the British Grand Fleet who led the Royal Navy into the Battle of Jutland in World War I. The first ascent of the peak was made in 1922 by E.W. Crawford, W. Gillespie, M.D. Geddes, M.P. Hendrie, and N.D.B. Hendrie. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1924 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Mount Jellicoe is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Jellicoe is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. In terms of favorable weather, July through September are the best months to climb.

This was the third parliamentary by-election held during the 57th UK Parliament, which was elected at the 2017 general election. Labour held the seat and Ruth Jones was elected as the new MP.  Background  In October 2018, the sitting MP Paul Flynn indicated his intention to resign his seat in the imminent future following a worsening of his rheumatoid arthritis. At the time, Flynn indicated that he would wait for a snap general election in case that allowed him to stand down without triggering a by-election, citing the expense involved in organising and holding one. He died on 17 February 2019 following a \\"long illness\\". Newport West has been held by Labour since 1987, when Flynn won the seat from the Conservatives. The constituency is semi- marginal, with Labour majorities not exceeding 10,000 votes except during the electoral landslide of 1997. The writ of election was moved in Parliament on 28 February, scheduling the by-election for 4 April 2019. Candidates and timetable Flynn had indicated his intention to stand down at or before the next general election and political parties had begun to select candidates in Newport West for the next general election, including Jonathan Clark (Plaid Cymru), Matthew Evans (Welsh Conservatives), Ruth Jones (Welsh Labour) and Amelia Womack (Green Party). UKIP selected its Welsh leader Neil Hamilton. The Liberal Democrats selected Ryan Jones. Also standing were Richard Suchorzewski for the Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party; June Davies for the Renew Party; Ian McLean for the continuing SDP; and candidates for For Britain and the Democrats and Veterans.STATEMENT OF PERSONS NOMINATED AND NOTICE OF POLL/DATGANIAD YNGHYLCH Y PERSONAU A ENWEBWYD A HYSBYSIAD O‚ÄôR BLEIDLAIS, Newport City Council The new Brexit Party said it would not be standing.

The election was administered by Newport City Council, with the statement of persons nominated published on 8 March 2019.Newport West Parliamentary By- election Newport City Council  Campaign  Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford announced on 12 March that the expected decision on the construction of an M4 relief road around Newport would be delayed due to the purdah rules that had taken effect during the by-election. Such rules prevented the government from making major policy announcements to avoid unduly influencing an election campaign. The news was strongly criticised by the Conservative candidate. The national backdrop for the by-election was the continued uncertainty over Brexit during the Brexit negotiations in 2019, with the original planned date for leaving the European Union being postponed and the failure of the House of Commons to agree a way forward. The Conservatives were concerned this would adversely affect their vote.\\"Snap election under May would 'annihilate' Tories\\", By E Malnick & J Maidment.

The company was founded in 1948 under the name Fa Wings. In 1991 it was renamed the Solar Wings. Wings produces products including toilet soap, powder and detergent bars, floorcleaners, fabric softeners, and sanitary napkins for markets throughout Indonesia and beyond. In 1981, while the third factory PT. Cipta Segar Harum (later renamed PT. Lionindo Jaya since 1990 and re-renamed PT Lion Wings since 2004) was built in Jakarta together with Lion Corporation Japan to produce brands such as Emeron, Page One, Ciptadent and Mama. Their products include shampoo, shower gel, skin care products, toothpaste, and liquid dishwashing.  History  In 1948, when Johannes Ferdinand Katuari (Oen Jong Khing) and Harjo Sutanto (Tan Siek Miauw), co- founders of Wings began a business using limited resources in their backyard to create a simple laundry soap. Katuari and Sutanto operated out of a small and sparse workshop in their home in Surabaya, East Java. Driven by the need to survive the post-war years, the two founders resolutely peddled their products from door to door, stall to stall, village to village. Their determination paid off; the laundry soap was well received by the community. The success spurred Katuari and Sutanto to expand their business, and more importantly, to develop more effective detergent formulations. The two entrepreneurs later started producing cream detergent, which quickly became a basic necessity for the East Java people. Cream detergent is an innovative product that is not found anywhere else. It has the cleaning power of detergent, but is much cheaper than conventional detergent (powder detergent) due to low energy cost and low investment cost of machinery. The product was an instant hit as it introduced a very practical and economical way of doing laundry for the average Indonesian family. Within a couple of years, it became widely popular through extensive promotions throughout Java and soon after, the whole of Indonesia. Katuari and Sutanto had named their business venture Wings, drawing inspiration and personification from Mother Nature. The founders worked like a ‚Äúpair of wings‚Äù and shared the same values and aspirations. The name reflects their vision which spells ‚Äúthe sky‚Äôs the limit‚Äù when it comes to developing a business based on an acute awareness of consumer needs, diligence and integrity. In 1981, Wings expanded their business while the third factory PT. Cipta Segar Harum (later renamed PT. Lionindo Jaya since 1990 and re-renamed PT Lion Wings since 2004) was built in Jakarta together with Lion Corporation Japan to produce brands such as Emeron, Page One, Ciptadent and Mama.

Keen to improve conditions for women, in 1897 she founded an embroidery school in Quarrata, Tuscany. From 1903, as president of the National Council of Italian Women, she supported voting rights for women and was behind the highly successful National Congress of Italian Women in 1908. Biography Born in Ravenna on 10 April 1853 into an artistocratic family, Gabriella Rasponi Spalletti was the eldest daughter of Count Cesare Rasponi Bonznzi (1822‚Äì1886), a politician and vice-consul, and Letizia Rasponi Murat (1832‚Äì1906). Apart from a short period in a convent, she was educated at home by private tutors. In 1870, she married the politician Count Venceslao Spalleti Trivelli with whom she had five children, three of whom survived: Carolina (1873‚Äì1940, Giambattista (1890‚Äì1967) and Cesare (1892‚Äì1967). After moving to Rome with her husband and family in 1894, Rasponi Spalletti became a board member of the Italian Red Cross and joined the Associazione per la donna (Association for Women) where she was responsible for medical supplies, fund raising and membership. Together with her husband, she supported charities and, in 1897, opened an embroidery school in Quarrata. Not only did it revive interest in local arts and crafts, it also developed into a thriving cooperative with hundred of embroiderers. In Rome, she became an active saloni√®re, inviting writers, philosophers, journalists and politicians to their home opposite the Quirinal Palace. Male guests included Marco Minghetti and Ruggero Bonghi but there were also many influential women including Dora Melegari, Antonietta Giacomelli and Giuseppina Lemaire, providing support for her interest in the social sphere and for working women. Following the death of her husband in 1899, she devoted renewed efforts to the women's movement, addressing the practical, intellectual and educational activities of women. After reinvigorating the Federazione romana delle opere femminili (Roman Feceration for Women's Works), in 1903 she founded the National Council of Italian Women. While the 1908 National Congress of Italian Women in Rome attracted over a thousand participants, a proposal to abolish religion in schools by the socialist Linda Malnati, supported by Rasponi Spalletti, caused the Catholics to leave and establish the Unione fra le donne cattoliche d‚ÄôItalia (Union of the Catholic Women of Italy). Gabriella Rasponi Spalletti died in Rome on 29 September 1931.

After his parents divorced, his mother married Creston Clarke, and Harry later adopted his last name (but changed the \\"a\\" to an \\"o,\\" and dropped the final \\"e\\" to be able to join the writers' union once he began working as a screenwriter; there was already another Harry Clark). After moving to New York and establishing himself first as a performer (chiefly in vaudeville productions), and second as a playwright, penning a number of works that hit Broadway, he broke into screenwriting in the mid-1930s. Some of his earliest efforts while under contract at Universal included 1935's Mister Dynamite and Diamond Jim. Over the ensuing two decades, he'd write a wide range of films at Universal, MGM, and Paramount, also dabbling in television writing toward the end of his career. Early on, he collaborated with fellow screenwriter Doris Malloy. He had retired by the 1970s; he died on June 18, 1978, and was survived by his daughter (from his second marriage to actress Mildred MacLeod). Earlier in life, he had been briefly married to Broadway actress Nora Bayes.

It was released on March 28, 2018 on their official YouTube channel.  Plot  Tanya, a woman in her twenties is at home getting dressed to meet Derek, a young man she has met twice. Her friend Richa browses his pictures on social media and expresses her ire at being told about him only after Tanya has met him twice. Tanya expresses her doubts about Derek and seems unsure about where things are going. She seems to have developed a fondness for Derek. As Richa teases her friend, Derek calls up and cancels the date. Tanya is hurt and does not take this well. Despite Richa trying to talk her out of it, Tanya decides to get even with Derek. Tanya then catfishes Derek by creating multiple fake dating profiles and not showing up. While the two have a laugh at this, Richa tries to talk Tanya out of taking this too far. Tanya however wants to play one last prank on Derek. She creates a dating profile pretending to be a Russian model and entices him to come to a cafe which is a four hour drive from where he is, the next morning. Tanya and Richa show up at the cafe and surreptitiously watch Derek standing outside the cafe as the woman he is to meet does not show up, yet again. After a while Derek turns to walk into the cafe and trips at the entrance. As the two women burst into peals of laughter, Derek gets up, brushes off the dust and takes a seat. Seated diagonally across is a young woman who points out that he has hurt himself and is bleeding at his temple. Derek wipes the blood and remarks that it just is not his lucky day. To this the young woman asks him if he believes in luck. Derek responds with 'I do' and we see him exchanging vows with the same woman at a beach. We further see a disappointed Tanya watching a video of both of them getting married, presumably on social media on her laptop. She then folds the laptop and the film ends.

Today, his designs remain popular with lace knitting enthusiasts.  Style  Lyra pattern cover by Herbert Niebling Herbert Niebling developed his style from working lace patterns disseminated in magazines and leaflets he read as a young boy. The first one he was exposed to was a design by Marie Niedner and Gussi von Reden published by Otto Beyer in 1921 as Band 46: Kunst- Stricken I. The designs of that time were geometric spirals and motifs which could be replicated and expanded to create a kaleidoscope effect. In contrast, Niebling's own later designs were not simply repetitive and geometric, but contained concentrated waves of increases and decreases to create fluid shapes portraying leaves and flowers. He drew constant inspiration from nature. During his frequent travels, he would collect plants from foreign countries and transform their blossoms and leaves into delicate lace pictures. His ability to construct a knitting pattern working directly from live flowers without having to sketch the image first was a key part of his continuing creative achievement. Niebling produced hundreds of knitted lace designs over the 40-plus years of his career. His patterns were published in magazines throughout Europe. Niebling himself knitted samples of his designs using special long steel double-pointed needles and extra fine cotton threads which are no longer available. \\"His finest work was a tablecloth measuring about 39 inches (100 cm) square and weighing only about an ounce (30 g) that could be drawn through a finger ring.\\"  Development of pattern symbols  In addition to mastering a new style of knit lace, Niebling also worked with his publisher in the 1930s to develop a set of universal symbols to represent the individual stitches in lace patterns which enabled an entire row of stitches to be read at a glance. This allowed the patterns to be more comprehensible and bring a wider readership for his publications. Publisher Aenne Burda purchased the Beyer publishing rights in 1963, and still uses the chart symbols Niebling originally developed.  Early life and education  Born in the German town of Averlak, in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, he learned to knit as a young boy from reading lace patterns found in leaflets of that time. By the age of six he was knitting his own stockings, and by the time he went to school, he was skilled enough to give knitting lessons to his classmates. During World War I, he knit many stockings to send to the troops on the front lines. As a nine-year-old, he created a piece of gobelin embroidery directly from a postcard reproduction of an old master painting without first having re-drawn it into a pattern template. He designed his first knitted lace doilies soon after. He went on to attend the University of Fine Arts of Hamburg, where he studied a variety of crafts during his 4-year apprenticeship, ranging from ceramics to tapestry. Nevertheless, it was at knitting design that he most excelled. He published his first knit lace patterns with Otto Beyer in the early 1930s. Publications from 1936 list his residence as Itzehoe.  Later life  He married Olga Linda Zehring on July 27, 1935 in Brandis. The couple lived in Itzehoe from 1935 to 1940, at which time Niebling was drafted to serve in the German army during the second World War. After returning home from a prisoner of war camp in June of 1945, he and his wife made their home in Bensheim. He began publishing lace patterns inspired by the flowers in his garden, and was known as the \\"Spitzenk√∂nig von der Bergstra√üe\\" (King of Lace from the Bergstra√üe). In February 1957, Niebling and his wife moved to Freiburg. In his studio he also made shawls for Valais costumes, as well as Spanish mantillas and lace hats for the Sunday best of the peasant women in the Bretagne. He died on May 15, 1966 in Freiburg.  Enduring popularity  Herbert Niebling's designs have remained popular in the modern day, although amassing a complete catalogue of his work has been difficult as some of his patterns have been published without attribution. The social knitting site Ravelry currently lists 440 different knitting patterns designed by Niebling with many thousands of individual projects inspired by those designs posted by their users.

Her career began in the 1870s when she established her brothel, House of Pleasure, in the Levee District of Chicago. At the height of her 30 year long career she was housing and managing 60 women; this enabled her to become one of Chicago's wealthiest African Americans with a reputation as a smart and giving business woman.Cynthia Blair, I've Got to Make My Living': Black Women's Sex Work in Turn-of-the-Century Chicago (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2010), 1. She was described as a true ‚Äúcharacter of the red light district.‚ÄùBlair, 1. Not much is known about Vina Fields‚Äô personal life, but historian Cynthia Blair details her massive impact on the sex industry of Chicago, giving her the recognition she deserves as an influential and important African American woman in the history of Chicago. Early career Vina Fields began her career with only eight black women working for her, but she also had one white servant. This made her the only black madam in Chicago to have a servant, as the norm was that only white madams owned servants; 20 years later she was managing 19 women and employing four servants.Blair, 44. Amidst the racial issues that divided black and white madams of Chicago there were issues in the Levee district that all madams had to face, regardless of their skin color and the most pervasive of these issues was rent. Landlords knew how lucrative the business of sex work could be so they looked the other way when it came to the illegal use of their buildings and charged extremely high prices for rent.Blair, 80. For example, in 1898 Vina Fields was renting a house for 175 dollars a month that would have normally only gone for about 40 dollars a month.Blair, 134. This reality often forced many brothel owners and madams to move further from the hub of the Levee but Fields was able to stay in the central region for the vast majority of her career. Her ability to maintain her brothel amidst absurd rates of rent and rampant police busts could have been due to the fact that she owned property in the Levee, making her one of only five madams in the city to do so. Blair, 82. She would also lease out this property to other brothel keepers; her ability to maintain multiple profitable ventures within the sex industry of Chicago ultimately contributed to her unique long-term success. 1893 The Worlds Columbian Exposition which came to Chicago in 1893 brought many visitors to the region and had business booming for Fields and her fellow brothel owners, it was at this point when she hit her prime with 60 female workers. At the same time, the Panic of 1893 swept through the nation and the Chicago workforce was hit hard, thousands of men and women lost their jobs.Blair, 37. So while 1893 brought the sex trade a steady stream of customers from the fair, other workers were devastated. Among the soup kitchens and the churches, brothel owners did what they could to help those out of work, it was said that Fields ‚Äúdaily fed a hungry, ragged regiment of the out-of-works.‚ÄùBlair, 38. The Move South 1910 marked the emergence of a new Southern Levee district, Fields moved with the transition, leaving her resort on Custom House Place after 25 years. The state of the sex trade and this new district was plagued by financial insecurity and many women, especially black women, were forced out of the industry. In 1900 ‚Äúof the 95 houses of ill fame counted in the census, only four (4 percent) were run and staffed by black women‚Äù demonstrating the increasing vulnerability of black women in the industry.Blair, 132. Even Vina Fields, as successful and brilliant as she was, was not exempt from the ‚Äúspatial, racial, and institutional landscapes of sexual commerce‚Äù that became more pervasive in this new space. Blair, 123. While in this new district, navigating the new organization of the sex industry Fields moved houses every few years, sometimes due to the financial burden of renting but there is also evidence that she was being pushed out of the district by other forces. In 1907 the Health Department quarantined Fields‚Äô house declaring the outbreak of smallpox, this public declaration was clearly bad for business and prompted Fields to again move to a new place.Blair, 134. An association as public as this one could have just as easily put Fields out of business for good and there are those that would suggest this was the exact intention of the quarantine.Blair, 271n30. Legacy Vina Fields‚Äô career ended soon after the push to this new region and the way she spent the rest of her days is as of yet not well documented but what is known about her life and about her time in the sex industry paints her in a genuine and positive light as a giver and a provider. Aside from providing for her neighbors when her community fell on hard times, Fields also used her wealth to support her family. She singlehandedly put her daughter through a convent school, she also sent money back to her sisters that were living in Missouri, and all the while was the proud owner of a home in an almost all-white neighborhood south of the Levee.Blair, 123. It is clear Fields was a good and generous women, she used her hard earned money to support her family and her community not only this but her work as a madam also provided a space for young black women of Chicago to do the same. She gave countless black women the opportunity to earn their own money, offering lucrative employment opportunities outside of the hard, low wage jobs that were available to them in the more traditional economy. Blair, 43. She was a pillar of her community, not just for black people of Chicago but for white people as well, offering opportunity for the former and a greatly sought after service for the latter. She navigated the tough racial divisions of her time and curated a unique space for herself prosper in a world where the intersectionality of her status as a black woman made it that much harder to achieve the level of success she did.

It had a single, closed cannon deck and was equipped with 26 18-pound cannons, two of which were on the forecastle and two on the quarterdeck. It was a full- rigged ship, with royals and skysails on all three masts. However, the ship keeled over too much under all sails and the masts were shortened and sails reduced in 1844. The ship carried one longboat and four smaller boats. Bow and figurehead of Galathea Galathea was on its first overseas voyage to the Mediterranean in 1833 and again in 1839. On the return from the latter journey, under command of Jens Seidelin, Galathea brought home 47 boxes of sculptures by Bertel Thorvaldsen from Rome to Copenhagen, as well as a couple of marble blocks for the sculptor Herman W. Bissen. Thorvaldsen had returned to Copenhagen the previous year, after having worked in Rome since 1797. After a major overhaul in 1844 Galathea launched on a circumnavigation of the world (known as the first Galathea Expedition) in 1845‚Äì1847, under command of Commander Steen Andersen Bille. The expedition left Copenhagen 24 June 1845 and returned 31 August 1847. It served combined scientific and diplomatic purposes and took a route south of Africa to the Indian subcontinent, past Japan and the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) across the Pacific, south of Cape Horn and across the Atlantic towards Copenhagen. Microscope used on the Galathea Expedition The scientist on board were Didrik Ferdinand Didrichsen (physician and botanist), Bernhard Casper Kamph«øvener (botanist), Carl Emil Kiellerup (entomologist), Hinrich Johannes Rink (geologist), Wilhelm Friedrich Georg Behn (zoologist) and Johannes Theodor Reinhardt (zoologist). Also two artists, Johan Christian Thornam (drawings) and Poul August Plum (paintings) were on board. The expedition collected large amounts of zoological, botanical and ethnological artifacts, but the immediate scientific results of the expedition were limited. This was primarily due to the death of the Danish King Christian 8th in 1848 and the first Schleswig War, which started later the same year. Christian 8th was personally interested in natural sciences, much more than his son and successor King Frederick 7th. The collected artifacts were distributed among the museums in Copenhagen and Kiel. The important diplomatic missions included strengthening of trade relationships with the Far East and South America, recolonising the Nicobar Islands and handing over the Danish trade posts in India to England. The primary first hand account of the expedition is due to the captain in the book St. Billes Beretning om Corvetten Gaiatheas Rejse omkring Jorden from 1853. Galathea stopped and sending help to the brig St Jan. Painting by Eckersberg, 1839 In 1848-49 Galathea participated in the first Schleswig War, where she patrolled the western Baltic and served in the blocade of the German harbours. In April 1849 Galathea was guarding the entrance to Eckernf√∂rde, but did not participate in the Battle of Eckernf√∂rde (5 April), as she was ordered to leave for Kiel on the very morning of the battle. In the following days Galathea participated in the transfer of troops to the fighting at Bov and to Eckernf√∂rde, together with HDMS Gejser, HDMS Hekla and HDMS Najaden. Later the same year Galathea together with the brig HDMS St. Crois blocked the German port in Pillau, where they took part in the fighting with the Preussian armoured steamer SMS Preu√üischer Adler, which was forced to withdraw to Danzig. After the war Galathea served briefly as guard vessel in the Sound. Galathea was sold to the private company Mohr & Kj√¶r, Copenhagen, in 1862 and rigged as a bark. Until 1870 she sailed emigrants from Bergen and Tronheim to Canada and was sold to Arendal in Norway in 1875. Galathea was lost at Oran, Algeria, on 11 May 1889.  Known Commanders 1833 Commander J.

His rays are > the most unusual among all Buddhas; they could even cover the light of the > sun and the moon Ma·πÖgala Buddha was 88 cubits, or 132 feet tall and his stupa was 30 yojana, or 229.2 miles high.  Biography  = Before birth = Ma·πÖgala Buddha had practised pƒÅramitƒÅ for 16 asa·πÉkhyeya and 100,000 (16√ó10^140 + 10^5) aeons to become a Buddha. During the gestation period, his mother, Queen Uttara, glowed very brightly around a radius of 80 cubits, or 120 feet. Because of the light, she could travel at night without the use of other light sources. = From birth to enlightenment = Ma·πÖgala Buddha was born in Uttara which was reigned by king Uttara. He was married to Queen Yasavadi and reigned the country for 9,000 years. His son was Sivala. As soon as his son was born, he decided to leave the palace to practise asceticism. Three million servants followed him to become fellow ascetics. He practised for eight months. After practising for eight months, he left his servant ascetics and went to the Mesua ferrea tree. He began to practise peacefully under the tree and gained enlightenment the next morning. = Gotama Buddha getting the omen = At Ma·πÖgala Buddha's time, Gotama Buddha was a Brahmin named Suruci from the Brahmin Village. After listening to the teachings of the Buddha, he invited him and his one trillion disciples to his place. When he was thinking about a place for them, Thagyamin helped him by building a large pavilion. Suruci decided to donate their needs for seven days as it was of high value. After a week of donation, Ma·πÖgala Buddha said: > \\"Suruci, a Brahmin, have made such donation.For this donation, he will > become a Buddha named Gotama in the Bhadda kalpa.\\" Suruci, having his wish granted, gave away all of his possessions and become a disciple of Ma·πÖgala Buddha. He became a god in the Brahma Realm after death. = Parinirvana = Ma·πÖgala Buddha lived for 90,000 years, liberating many living beings. He attained parinirvana and died at Vassara park. In the Buddhavamsa, his death is described as:  The rays of Ma·πÖgala Buddha  Ma·πÖgala Buddha had brighter rays than other Buddhas. His rays were so bright that people could not determine whether it was day or night. Because of the rays, there were no sunlight or moonlight. Every object shined like a gold during the presence of Ma·πÖgala Buddha. There are two stories of Ma·πÖgala Buddha's rays. #The incarnation of Ma·πÖgala Buddha was asked to donate his children by a Biru named KharadƒÅ·π≠hika who was disguised as a Brahmin. The incarnation happily donated his children to him. As soon as KharadƒÅ·π≠hika ate them, he vomited the blood of the children. Without any anxiety, the incarnation said \\"Like this Biru vomiting such blood of bright color, my body shall shine very brightly\\". #Another incarnation of Ma·πÖgala Buddha had a chance to see the stupa of a Buddha. After seeing the stupa, he said to himself \\"I must sacrifice my life for this Buddha\\". Then, he covered himself with butter and paid homage by performing the fire dancing for a whole night.He was not burnt or felt warm while paying homage.

The tradition of the choir is based on the medieval Schola of St. Ursenstift, the collegiate church that preceded Solothurn Cathedral, and which is first mentioned in 742. This makes the choir the oldest boys' choir in Switzerland. The choir is denominationally neutral today. The repertoire includes both religious and secular choral literature from all eras. Activities The choir comprises more than 60 boys and young men who spend three or four hours a week singing. The intensive rehearsals apply to the development of new literature in individual parts as well as in the entire choir. A professional vocal artist and a singing teacher accompany the work of the Singknaben. The pivotal point in the musical year of the choir is the singing of the boys' voices, during which the program for the annual autumn concert is worked out. The performance in Solothurn is usually followed by a tour of guest concerts in different European countries. In addition, the Christmas Oratorio by Johann Sebastian Bach has been an integral part and traditional highlight of the concert program of the Solothurner Singknaben for several years. The diverse repertoire of singers includes not only contemporary choral music but also Gregorian chants, motets, cantatas, masses, as well as secular and sacred songs, including folk songs from Switzerland and other countries. History The history of the choir is rooted in the founding of the St. Ursenstift, which already by 742 had a boys choir, the Choraulen.Max Banholzer: Die Choraulen von St. Ursen Solothurn: Geschichte der Solothurner Singknaben. Jahrbuch f√ºr Solothurnische Geschichte, 77 (2004) doi:10.5169/seals-325230. With over 1,200 years of history, the Singknaben are the oldest boys' choir in Switzerland and also one of the most traditional choirs in Europe. In earlier centuries, the boys' assignment was limited to unanimously singing the Latin Mass. Until well into the 20th century, the choir consisted only of a few singers. In 1971, Peter Scherer took over the management of the then five- member choir and built him in the following years to a representative boys choir. With Andreas Reize, who was already a boy member of the choir, the Singknaben have since 2007 for the first time emerged from their own ranks musical director. Other former members of the Solothurn Boys' Choir are now available as professional singers on international stages.

He is most notable for his service in the South Dakota Senate in the early 1890s and as Attorney General of South Dakota in the early 1900s. Early life Adolphus William Burtt (sometimes spelled \\"Burt\\") was born in New York on May 28, 1832, the son of Warren D. Burtt and Sarah (Fowler) Burtt. He was educated raised and educated in Watertown and Mendon. Burtt attended Genesee Wesleyan Seminary, then worked as a bookkeeper. At the time of the 1860 census, he was living with his wife's family in West Bloomfield, New York. Start of career Burtt moved to Pontiac, Michigan in the mid-1860s. He studied law, probably under Michael E. Crofoot, whose partner he later became, and was admitted to the bar in 1869. He was active in politics as a Republican, and ran unsuccessfully for prosecuting attorney of Oakland County and city clerk of Pontiac. Burtt served as a justice of the peace of Pontiac's municipal court, and afterwards was usually referred to as \\"Judge Burtt\\". After several years of practice as Crofoot & Burtt, in 1877 Crofoot's son Louis joined the firm, which became known as Crofoot, Burtt & Crofoot. Move to South Dakota In 1881, Burtt and Louis W. Crofoot were among a large contingent of Pontiac residents who decided to file claims for land grants in the Dakota Territory and move to what is now Beadle County, South Dakota. Burtt and Louis Crofoot practiced in partnership in Huron, and Burtt served several terms as Huron's city attorney, in addition to running unsuccessfully for mayor. Burtt won election to the South Dakota Senate in 1892, and served one term, 1893 to 1895. When Attorney General John L. Pyle died in 1902, Governor Charles N. Herreid appointed Burtt to fill the vacancy, and he served from March 1902 until January 1903. He was not a candidate for a full term in 1902, and was succeeded by Philo Hall. From 1906 to 1907, Burtt served as president of the South Dakota Bar Association. He was also the longtime president of the Beadle County Bar Association. Burtt was an active member of the Masons and the Elks, and had a reputation as an effective orator, which caused him to be sought out for speeches at political meetings, holiday commemorations, and other events. Retirement and death In 1909, Burtt and his wife moved to Kalispell, Montana so they could reside near their daughter and son-in-law. He died in Kalispell on January 7, 1917 and was buried at Conrad Memorial Cemetery in Kalispell. Family In 1857, Burtt married Emily Elizabeth Beebe (1836-1910) of West Bloomfield, New York. They were the parents of a daughter, Nellie (1864-1938). Nellie Burtt was the wife of George A. Fessenden (1863-1910).

History The Sumatra Kula cocktail was created by Donn Beach, also known as \\"the beachcomber\\" because of his Don the Beachcomber chain of restaurants, and may have been one of his very first drinks, allegedly gaining notoriety after he served it to a reporter from the New York Tribune. A book co-authored by his ex-wife Phoebe Beach claims it was his very first original mixed drink and sold for 25 cents. The drink as appearing on a later cocktail menu from his Hollywood location depicts it as being served in a tall curved glass accompanied by a leafy garnish and selling for 85 cents. The drink was not typically ordered at other types of bars but began gaining attention again during the 21st century resurgence in tiki culture. Named in part in reference to Sumatra, some also believe that the word \\"kula\\" may be a separate and generic reference to the \\"Kula exchange\\", which is a reciprocal exchanging of social gifts. Beach traveled on the cheap through places where Kula was practiced such as Papua New Guinea, making the claim both plausible and speculative. In addition to being an explorer of the south pacific, Beach also traveled heavily both as a rum-runner and when he served overseas in France and Italy during World War II. The cocktail is also sometimes mistakingly referred to as a Sumatra Cooler, either an intentional play on words or a misunderstanding between similarly sounding \\"kula\\" and \\"cooler\\" drinks on Beach's menus (such as the Q.B. Cooler). Regardless, the Sumatra Kula would not be a typical \\"cooler\\" drink as it doesn't contain a form of sparkling water or other carbonated beverage.  Variations  Like many tiki drinks, multiple variations existed as popular cocktails whose ingredients were not known were \\"estimated\\" and given the same name at competing bars.

Under the existing health service system large out-of-pocket payments are required; the Republic of Ireland is the only state within the EU which does not provide universal healthcare, according to WHO criteria.Tamas, Evetovits,; Policies, European Observatory on Health Systems and; Europe, WHO Regional Office for (2012-11-16). \\"Health system responses to financial pressures in Ireland: policy options in an international context\\" The newly elected Irish government committed itself in March 2011 to reform the two-tier structure of national health service in response to public discontent with austerity measures from 2008 onwards. Since public funding of health provision was reduced between 2009 and 2013 to meet payment obligations arising from the state's budget deficit, citizens faced higher medical charges and extended waiting lists. In reaction to this development, the coalition government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party declared to introduce ‚Äúa universal single-tiered health service, which guarantees access based on need, not income‚Ä¶ through Universal Health Insurance.‚Äù The published government plan, outlined in the 2014 document ‚ÄúThe Path to UHC ‚Äì The White Paper‚Äù, foresaw introducing compulsory private health insurance based on managed competition between insurance companies to abolish the distinction between public and private patient status. Key features of the policy entailed mandatory health insurance for every citizen under free choice of insurer as well as entitlement to the same package of care, covering primary and acute hospital services. Further, patients should be charged in turn insurance premium irrespective of age or risk profile and additionally have the right to change their insurance membership on an annual basis. Those citizens who are unable to afford the amount of premium would have qualified for subsidies to cover the required premium payments by a National Insurance fund. The implementation of the proposed model of universal health insurance was supposed to be conducted by 2019. However, after a public consultation procedure regarding the reform initiatives the plan of universal health insurance was abandoned by the Irish administration in November 2015 due to projections that the envisaged system would be too costly and would still require the highest share of funds by general taxation. According to the state department of health, the implied costs of universal health insurance would have led to approximately 11% higher expenditures than the existing system. After the Irish parliamentary election of 2016, Fine Gael formed a minority government supported by independent parliamentarians. Social Democrat TD R√≥is√≠n Shortall founded in June 2016 an all-party ‚ÄúCommittee on the Future of Healthcare‚Äù following an initiative by the health department with the aim to identify an appropriate approach for establishing universal healthcare in Ireland. The committee was supported by an academic team from Trinity College Dublin to analyse submissions made within 30 public hearings in the course of the public consultation process. In May 2017 the committee published its final report entitled ‚ÄúCommittee on the Future of Health, Sl√°intecare Reporthttps://www.gov.ie/en/publication/0d2d60-slaintecare-publications/‚Äù, which specified universal healthcare based on the following definition: The document entails a proposed ten-year plan for reforming the Irish health system towards universal healthcare. It consists of five sections, covering Population health profile, Entitlements and Access to Healthcare, Integrated care, Funding and Implementation. The report foresees the provision of health cards called Carta Sl√°inte to every citizen, granting access to primary care free of charges at specified local entities preferably outside of hospitals. This system is planned to be funded by taxation, requiring an increase of public health spending and further infrastructure investment of approximately 3 billion Euros. The submitted plan was debated twice in the parliament in 2017 and the Irish government decided to found an official implementation office to appoint a head of the organisation as well as to develop a drafted implementation plan by December 2017.

The final of the competition was played as a night game at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) instigated the tournament in order to give Bangladeshi players more experience in the 20-over format, in the hope that local players will become more prominent in the Bangladesh Premier League. For this reason the tournament featured local cricketers exclusively, unlike the Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League, in which foreign players take part. Shinepukur Cricket Club were the first team to qualify for the semi-finals of the tournament, after they won their two matches in Group C. On the final day of the group stage, Prime Bank Cricket Club from Group A and Sheikh Jamal Dhanmondi Club from Group B also progressed to the semi-finals. The final match in Group D, between Gazi Group Cricketers and Prime Doleshwar Sporting Club was washed out, so the fixture was rescheduled for the reserve day to determine which team progresses. Prime Doleshwar Sporting Club won the rescheduled match by three wickets, winning Group D and becoming the fourth team to advance to the semi-finals. In the first semi-final, Sheikh Jamal Dhanmondi Club beat Shinepukur Cricket Club by five wickets, with man of the match Ziaur Rahman finishing unbeaten on 72 runs from just 29 balls.

The majority of its members were young men from the Rajput caste, and the militia was named after the 19th century figure Kunwar Singh, who is considered be a community hero by the Rajputs of Bihar. History The Kuer Sena was one of the first of the caste armies to emerge in Bihar during the Naxalite uprising. It was founded by the Rajput landlord and coal businessman, Rajnath Singh who was also an affiliate of the Indian National Congress party. While it initially had innocent aims, it eventually grew into having a more sinister role and became a violent defender of the existing class and caste structure which the Naxalite insurgents were fighting against. Because of this, Rajnath Singh was eventually arrested by the local government for heading what was essentially a terrorist organisation and the running of the militia was left to his commander, Bir Bahadur Singh. Bir Bahadur Singh was also known to the local authorities and was connected to some 20 murder cases meaning that he was often in and out of jail. He was eventually elected as an MLA for the Jagdispur area and his tenure was mired by atrocities against the so-called \\"lower castes\\". They regularly engaged in battles with the MCC militias and often found themselves allying with other caste-based armies like the Ranvir Sena which was controlled by members of the Bhumihar caste and the Bhumi Sena which was controlled by members of the Kshatriya Kurmi caste. Disintegration The organisation ended up collapsing due to its over-reliance on a few Rajput landlords as leadership, many of whom were often sent to jail. The Rajputs soon started to band around a new caste- based army known as the Sunlight Sena which was formed in the early 1990s and allied with Muslim landlords in the region.

David Litwa, Refutation of All Heresies Life Justin's life is unknown, although he likely came from a Jewish-Christian background. Most information about him comes from Hyppolytus, who might have been familiar with Justin's most important work, Baruch. He is counted among the earliest Gnostics, having lived in the era of Simonians like Simon Magus, Dositheus, Menander and Saturninus.Willis Barnstone, Marvin Meyer, The Gnostic Bible Teachings His teachings, synthesized in a gospel called Book of Baruch, were a highly syncretic gnostic current that mixed Jewish Christianity with classical mythology. They are considered one of the first transitions between Jewish monotheism and full-blown gnosticism, even although it contains substantial differences with posterior Gnosticism, most particularly presenting the creation of the world in a positive light. According to Justin, there were three primordial, eternal entities. Reigning supreme was the male Good One, owner of foreknowledge (identified with the Monad and the creator of the universe, as well as the Greek Priapus), under which there were the male Elohim (the Jewish god and Demiurge or creator of the world) and the female Edem (identified with Gaia and described as a \\"half virgin, half viper\\" being similar to Echidna).Miroslav Marcovich, Studies in Graeco-Roman Religions and Gnosticism Elohim and Edem, ignorant of the existence of the Good One, fell in love and copulated, giving birth to twenty-four angels of both paternal and maternal nature, also creating the world in the process. Those angels then created mankind out of Edem's human part and the animal kingdom out of her snake part. However, Elohim discovered the Good One and ascended to his heaven, where he was charged to stay to redeem himself from having thought himself the greatest. Dominion over the Earth was thus assigned to Edem who, vengeful and heartbroken by Elohim's departure, released the evils of famine and disease on the world. Her twelve angels ruled the world as archons.Todd S. Berzon, Classifying Christians: Ethnography, Heresiology, and the Limits of Knowledge in Late Antiquity Edem further ordered one of her maternal angels, Naas (identified with the serpent of Edem), to cause adulteries and dissolutions of marriages among men. In response, Elohim send one of his own paternal angels, Baruch, in order to warn Adam and Eve not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge, which represented Naas himself. However, Baruch failed, as Naas had previously seduced both Adam and Eve, leading them to eat from the tree. Baruch's next attempts to save mankind through Moses and the biblical prophets failed too, so Elohim now chose an uncircumcised man, Heracles, to carry on the task. Heracles defeated all the twelve maternal archons by force, a series of battles known as the Twelve Labors, but he was ultimately seduced and divested of his power by one of the conquered archons, the beautiful Babel or Omphale. Only much later, Elohim found a human who could resist the enticement of the angels, Jesus (son of Elohim in an adoptionist way), who would preach his true word despite being crucifixied by work of Naas. Only five names of the angels of Elohim are preserved: Baruch, Michael, Gabriel, Amen and Esaddeus. The twelve angels of Edem are Naas, Babel, Achamoth, Bel, Belias, Satan, Sael, Adonaios, Leviathan, Carcamenos, Lathen and Pharaoh.Tuomas Rasimus, Paradise Reconsidered in Gnostic Mythmaking: Rethinking Sethianism in Light of the Ophite Evidence See alsoSethianism *Barbelo Notes Systematic theologians Gnosticism Gnostics 2nd-century Christians 2nd-century writers 2nd-century Christian theologians Year of birth unknown Place of birth unknown Year of death unknown ","title":"Justin (gnostic)"},{"id":"60005936","text":"Jamaal Talib Henryhttps://www.allmusic.com/artist/jamaal-talib-henry- mn0003563786 (born September 26, 1994), known professionally as Maaly Raw, is an American record producer and songwriter.

He stopped playing basketball in 2010 after his best friend and local Philly legend, Quandaar White, lost his life playing football. White and Henry grew up down the street from one another. Because his dad was a trumpet player in a West Philly High School band, Henry was introduced to music at a young age. In grade school, he started playing the clarinet. Much of Henry‚Äôs childhood was spent in Southwest Philly with his cousin Nasir and his brother B-Jones. In West Philadelphia, Henry learned musical production through B-Jones, who had taught him to use the Fruity Loops software at the age of 17. A year later, he collaborated with a street rapper named Kur on a project, which he described as his debut as a professional. Career He started working with local rapper Kur who introduced him to another local artist Lil Uzi Vert. Henry had produced a song by Kur featuring Lil Uzi Vert called ‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt Give A Fuck‚Äù, which led to constant collaborations Henry and Lil Uzi Vert. Both Henry and Charlie Heat co-produced Uzi‚Äôs debut project The Real Uzi. His first official hit came with ‚ÄúMoney Longer‚Äù off Uzi‚Äôs project Lil Uzi vs The World, which has since gone double platinum. Henry also produced the songs ‚ÄúCanadian Goose‚Äù, and ‚ÄúHi Roller‚Äù off the project. XXL and Hot New Hip Hop both listed Henry as a top 30 producer of 2016. Henry then went on to produce 3 more tracks off Uzi‚Äôs next project The Perfuct Luv Tape, which includes ‚ÄúDo What I want‚Äù, ‚ÄúGhetto Flowers‚Äù, and ‚ÄúOriginal Uzi‚Äù. In 2018, Henry went gold with the Playboi Carti track ‚ÄúShoota‚Äù featuring Lil Uzi Vert. He also went gold with Meek Mill‚Äùs Championships by producing the track ‚ÄúAlmost Slipped‚Äù. He is responsible for 4 tracks off of Uzi‚Äôs follow up tape Luv is Rage 2, which went platinum. The Fader described his production style as \\"hurls songs forward, their momentum deftly guided by his wickedly weird and winding melodies, and drums that at once skitter across and barrel down your insides.\\" Henry cites Lex Luger as an influence to this musical work.

Most of the narrowly inverted egg-shaped leaves are silky hairy and in a basal rosette with no or few very narrow bracts on the stalk in the subspecies bellidioides. In the subspecies foliosa, the narrower leaves are not silky hairy but variously bristly and glandular, with more and larger bracts on the inflorescence stalk. The flowerheads sit individually on top of a long peduncle and consist of an involucre with only two worls of bracts, about twenty purplish blue ray florets, surrounding many yellow disc florets. It occurs in the Western Cape province of South Africa.  Description  Felicia bellidioides subsp. bellidioides is a perennial, upwardly growing plant of up to high, sometimes with runners. Its leaves are set alternate along the stems (with the exception of the lowest pair that is opposite), mostly crowded in a basal rosette. The leaves are inverted egg- shaped to narrowly inverted egg-shaped, sometimes with an indistinct stalk, either broader and shorter, long and wide, and then usually white silky hairy, or 2¬Ω‚Äì3 cm (1.0‚Äì1.2 in) long and wide and distinctly hairy, or longer, long and 1¬Ω‚Äì5 mm (0.06‚Äì0.2 in) wide and usually short bristly and glandular hairs. In all forms the leaf margins rarely carry a few teeth. = Flowers and seeds = The flower heads are individually set on top of an up to long stalk, that mostly carries no bracts but rarely very narrow bracts. The involucre is up to in diameter and consists of a double row of long bracts. The outer bracts are lance-shaped, about 1¬Ω mm (0.06 in) wide, and carry long hairs or glandular bristles. The inner bracts are narrowly inverted egg-shaped and about 2 mm (0.08 in) wide, with a few hairs and a papery margin. Each flower head carries about twenty ray florets, with a purplish blue ligula of about long and 3 mm (0.12 in) wide. These encircle numerous disc florets, with a yellow corolla of up to 3 mm long. Encircling the base of the corolla are many white, toothed, deciduous, pappus bristles of 2‚Äì3 mm (0.08‚Äì0.12 in) long. The eventually black, dry, one-seeded, indehiscent fruits called cypsellae are inverted egg- shaped, about 2¬Ω mm (0.1 in) long and wide, set with fine scales and with up to long hair, and are edged with an mostly brighter coloured ridge around the outline. = Subspecies = Felicia bellidioides subsp. foliata differs from the typical subspecies by having bracts higher up the peduncles, clearly stalked, longer and narrower leaves of 1‚Äì6 cm long and ‚Äì4 mm wide, without the silky hairs.  Taxonomy  Rudolf Schlechter was the first to describe this species in 1897, based on a specimen collected on the Matroosberg at an altitude of about in 1895 by Rudolf Marloth. J√ºrke Grau in his 1973 Revision of the genus Felicia (Asteraceae) distinguished a form with bracts higher up the peduncle, stalked, longer and narrower leaves without the silky hair characteristic of the typical form. He named it Felicia bellidioides subsp. foliata, the type of which has been collected by Barker on the Voetpadsberg between Worcester and Laingsburg in 1951. The species is considered to be part of the section Neodetris. The species name bellidioides has been compounded from the Latin bellis referring to the genus Bellis, and the Greek suffix -oides, which means \\"in the form of\\".  Distribution, habitat and ecology  Felicia bellidioides subsp. bellidioides is known from the Hottentots Holland Mountains in the southwest to Matroosberg in the northeast. Isolated subpopulations of this subspecies also occurs in the Riviersonderend Mountains near Genadendal, the Groot Winterhoek Mountains near Gouda, the Anysberg, and the Klein Swartberg near Ladysmith. Subsp. foliosa borders the distribution a to the north and east, from the Cederberg, the Kouebokkeveld Mountains, Keeromsberg, the Witteberg near Laingsburg, Eendracht near Montagu, and the Swartberg Pass. The species is restricted to altitudes of , where it often grows in cracks in the rocks.  Conservation  Both subspecies of Felicia bellidioides have a stable population and their continued survival is considered to be of least concern.

His work primarily uses recontextualised vernacular photographs of recent historical events, found in German state archives, in order to pose questions about photography. He mainly produces books of this work, often with Annett Gr√∂schner on the time of a divided Germany, but also exhibits it. Messmer won the Otto Steinert Prize from the German Society for Photography in 1996, was co-winner (with Gr√∂schner) of a DAM Architectural Book Award in 2011 and 2012, and was shortlisted for the Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Foundation Prize in 2018. Life and work Messmer was born in 1964 in Schopfheim in the district of L√∂rrach, Germany. He moved to Berlin in 1991. His work over the course of 25 years has dealt with issues surrounding German post-war history. For the latter 10 years he has worked primarily with utilitarian images produced by the state, that he has found in a number of archives. In 1994 and 1995 Messmer made a series called \\"Potsdamer Platz, Anno Zero\\" (Potsdamer Platz, Year Zero). Potsdamer Platz was an important public square and traffic intersection in the centre of Berlin that was totally destroyed during World War II and then left desolate during the Cold War era when the Berlin Wall bisected its former location. Messmer's series is concerned with this period, before it became the site of major redevelopment projects. Messmer's 2014 book Reenactments MfS uses photographs of re-enactments of escape attempts across the Berlin Wall, and crime-scene exhibits, sourced from the Stasi Records Agency. The images were made in the course of crime investigations by the Ministry for State Security (MfS), commonly known as the Stasi, the official state security service of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Re- enactments were \\"often restaged with participation by the actual escapee after they were caught\\". Messmer provides new contexts for the photographs and removes their captions. The book also includes Messmer's \\"Revisited Places\\" series of photographs that he made in 2014. Messmer's 2016 book Zelle/Cell is about the West German far-left militant organisation the Red Army Faction (RAF), also known as the Baader-Meinhof Group. It contains lesser-known photographs of the group's history between 1968 (with the 2 June Movement) and 1977. The work was shown in an exhibition titled RAF: No Evidence / Kein Beweis in June 2018 at Museum Folkwang in Essen, Germany. The critic Gerry Badger has written that \\"He is not attempting to reconstruct the history but play creatively, as it were, with this fascinating, but enigmatic material. . . . Messmer is questioning photography‚Äôs role, both as witness, and ultimately, as art.\\" Messmer says \\"My work also has an ethical dimension: What images can be shown? How can they be shown? And why should we look at them?\\". Publications =Publications by Messmer=Hier beginnt die Zukunft, hier steigen wir aus. Berlin: Berlin, 2002. . Photographs by Messmer. .

Created in 1754 and re-landscaped in the English style in the 1860s, it is the oldest park in the city and has been designated by the French Ministry of Culture as a \\"Jardin remarquable\\" (notable garden). It is located in the southeast area of Toulouse with its main entrance on the corner of Rue Ozenne and All√©e Jules Guesde. History The park was created as part of a major urban renewal project for Toulouse designed in 1751 by the economist and urbanist Louis de Mondran (1699‚Äì1792). The project involved demolishing a large area of dilapidated buildings and slums to create a network of interconnected esplanades, parks, plazas, and embankments. A central part of the plan was to build broad tree-lined avenues radiating from an oval hub. One of the avenues led to what would become the Jardin Royal. The oval hub itself would become another park, now known as the . Although not all of de Mondran's plan was implemented, the Jardin Royal was created in 1754. During the French Revolution, its name was changed to the \\"Park Public\\", and the two names continued to fluctuate over the next 130 years depending on the political situation in France. However, its name was finalised as \\"Jardin Royal\\" in 1886 following a decree by the Toulouse City Council. In the early 19th century the Jardin Royal was also the site of a forestry school. From 1861 to 1863, during the height of the Second French Empire, the park was completely re-landscaped in the English style. It underwent a restoration project in 2016 which maintained the English style but with new plantings and park furniture. The project was completed in November 2018. La Gloire de l'Aviation in the Jardin Royal photographed in 1961 during a wreath-laying led by Didier Daurat Features The Jardin Royal encompasses 1.7 hectares with lawns, winding paths and a footbridge flanked by a large Ginkgo biloba tree that leads to the Grand Rond park. At its centre is a lake with a duck house and a rustic bridge at one end. The park contains several species of trees that are relatively rare to the area ‚Äîcedar of Lebanon, Himalayan cedar, Virginia tulip tree, Osage orange, and American copalme‚Äîsome of them 200 years old. The park has several statues and sculptures including a statue of The Little Prince in memory of Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry and one of the composer D√©odat de S√©verac sculpted by Auguste Gu√©not (1882‚Äì1966). La Gloire de l'Aviation, a monument to French aviation pioneers sculpted in marble by Aristide Maillol stood in the park from 1948 until 1993 when it was removed after being damaged by repeated vandalism. An abstract steel sculpture by Theodoulos Gregoriou commemorating Jean Mermoz and the pilots of the A√©ropostale was erected in its place in 2001. The Jardin Royal has been designated by the French Ministry of Culture as a \\"Jardin remarquable\\" (notable garden) since 2013.

In the Watchmen sequel Doomsday Clock, Helga Jace is among the people that reveal the Superman Theory.Doomsday Clock #2. DC Comics. In other media =Television= Helga Jace appears in season two of Black Lightning portrayed by Jennifer Riker. Jace is an exceptional mad scientist who had been incarcerated for her illegal experiments. She is roped into helping Lynn and the A.S.A. treat metahuman children placed into stasis pods. One notable experiment that Dr. Jace performed caused 10 people to lose their feet and one to die. To punish her, an implant is placed in her ankle that prevents her from leaving the designated area. After being re-incarcerated when some of the pod children die from the trial run of a treatment she came up with, she is sprung from her cell by Todd Green, where it was revealed that she made the anti-aging serum that Tobias Whale took. Jace then takes Tobias to where the remaining pod children are. In the episode \\"The Book of the Apocalypse: Chapter One: The Alpha\\", Jace assists Tobias and Giselle Cutter in releasing Shakedown's fellow prisoners New Wave, Heatstroke, and Coldsnap from their pods. While tending to Shakedown after Cutter attacked him, she later speaks to Tobias about Cutter being unstable, only for him to dismiss it. Cutter informs the two of them of former minion, Lala's attack, causing Tobias and Cutter to escape in their car while Jace contacts New Wave to get the Masters of Disaster to the rendezvous. In \\"The Book of the Apocalypse: The Omega\\", Helga Jace tries to ambush Black Lightning where Tobias kept the pods only for her to be beaten into submission by Lynn Stewart. To evade being handed over to the A.S.A., Jace gives Black Lightning and Lynn the information they need. Jace is then handed over to Deputy Chief Henderson. While in police custody, the teleporter Instant shows up at the Freeland Police Department and shoots the police officers guarding her. When Jace notes the teleportation ability, Instant reveals that he is a bounty hunter who was contracted by the Markovians to reclaim Jace. Instant then teleports away with Jace in his clutches. In season three, Helga Jace is in the Markovians' possession working to stabilize the metahumans in their possession until she is extracted during Black Lightning's mission to rescue Lynn. She does reveal to Brandon that his father has earth-based powers and was the one who killed his mother even when he has her bound in his apartment. In the season three finale during the Markovian's invasion of Freeland, Commander Carson Williams breaks into Brandon's apartment and kills Dr. Jace as part of his orders to remove classified information. * Helga Jace debuts in the Young Justice: Outsiders season, voiced by Grey DeLisle. She starts out as the personal physician to Markovia's royal family until she became an unwilling participant in a metahuman trafficking ring, who also kidnapped Princess Tara after she had tested positive for the meta-gene. After Prince Brion was banished, the Outsiders allowed her to come with them to the USA so she can watch over the young prince as well as Violet Harper/Halo. Helga has also entered a relationship with Jefferson Pierce/Black Lightning. Similarly to the comics, she was responsible for giving Brion and Princess Tara their varied geokinetic powers; in fact, she coined Brion's codename of \\"Geo-Force\\" in reference to said powers. However, it is implied that she may have an agenda of her own, expressing interest in helping Victor Stone/Cyborg learn to cope with and perfect his robot components with her expertise. She manages to convince her superhero lover, Jeff, that she cannot do so without a laboratory of her own; feeling that it is the least she could do to repay everyone's kindness to her. On the other hand, she was unaware that Tara was recording the conversation for Deathstroke. She is indeed seen to be studying Violet's D.N.A. and the spirit of the destroyed Mother-Box that is within her. In the episode \\"Illusion of Control\\", she expresses her gratitude at being included in her very first Thanksgiving in America, enjoying the feast provided by Artemis. She then informs a paraplegic Paula that Artemis has deeply impressed her with mentoring Halo, Tara, and Geo-Force as Tigress; unaware of Paula's strong opposition to her youngest daughter returning to crime-fighting. During the second half of the season, she has been seen contacting a mysterious \\"mentor\\" (who is later revealed in the episode \\"Unknown Factors\\" to be Ultra-Humanite). In \\"Antisocial Pathologies\\", Jace is further revealed to have been willingly working for the Light all this time. She had activated the metagenes for both Tara and Brion, considering them to be her children, while euthanizing Gabrielle when she had tested negative for the metagene. It also turned out that the relationship between her and Black Lightning was a lie, as she was only using him to get what she wanted. In \\"Nevermore\\", she becomes Brion's advisor when he becomes the new ruler of Markovia.

It was a battered fried chicken sandwich that featured a fried chicken cutlet with shredded lettuce and pepper mayonnaise, with a sesame seed bun. The sandwich was very popular because of its affordability  it cost only 99 cents. The sandwich, like all KFC products, featured the Colonel's famous 11 herbs and spices, making it a \\"Bull's-eye for taste\\" Background  According to the Executive Vice President of Marketing at KFC, Scott Bergren \\"The KFC Snacker was a huge hit with consumers because it satisfies their need for a high-quality, affordable, portable chicken sandwich.\\" Officials at KFC credit the popularity of the sandwich to its convenience and user-friendliness. Bergen also comments on the portability of the sandwich, lightly hinting at the idea that this sandwich is all around good  it tastes good, it's cheap, and it's transportable. Bergen added, \\"The KFC Snacker is an example of how KFC is becoming more relevant to today's consumers. We are appealing to individuals as well as families with products that are in tune with their lifestyle needs.\\" According to Bergren, The Snacker is also a part of a campaign that KFC has taken on in order to appeal to the individual and families. This is easily noticeable in their more recent advertisements which feature a different, more lively and inviting version of the colonel, as well as an expansive amount of deals and coupons they offer such as the $5 fill-up meals or the family dinner combos. There has been speculation that the sandwich was discontinued because of its explosive popularity. It drew attention away from KFC's main course, the classic bucket of chicken. The KFC Snacker's portability, combined with its great taste and cheap price made for a steep competition for KFC's original glory. This eventually led to the company discontinuing the sandwich all together around 2013‚Äì2014. Fans were frustrated and took to social media to voice their \\"dissatisfaction\\". KFC eventually released another small size chicken sandwich to replace the Snacker called the Chicken Little. The Chicken Little is similar to the Snacker except that it has pickles instead of lettuce, and plain mayonnaise instead of pepper mayonnaise. But unfortunately for many fans, the Chicken Little does not quite compare to the Snacker. Perhaps for some, the simplicity of just chicken, pickles, mayo, and bun is appealing. However, the textures in the Snacker, the crunchy lettuce combined with the crispy fried chicken, will be missed by consumers.

In an unusual court ruling, the judge at his trial allowed him to repay the money he had stolen through the sale of the stamps he had bought with the proceeds of his fraud. Fraud Over a period of 14 years,\\"Thief must sell stamp collection on eBay\\", Steve Bird, The Times, 19 April 2008, p. 27. Klein stole about ¬£13,000 from St Peter's in Ridlington and ¬£57,000 from St Andrew's in Bacton, both in Norfolk, England. He was treasurer of both churches. He used the money for \\"an internet gambling addiction and his obsession with stamps\\". It was heard in court that Klein's nickname on one of the internet gambling sites he used was \\"The Bishop\\". In 2008, Klein persuaded the judge at Norwich Crown Court, who had wanted to sell Klein's entire collection at auction, to let him sell it piecemeal on eBay, saying that he could raise four times as much. In 2013, the decision was vindicated, when Klein finished paying off his debt. Had Klein not been successful, he would have had to spend two more years in prison. Klein's collection of 100,000 first day covers weighed about three tons.

The event took place on May 2, 2003, at the Tokyo Dome in Tokyo, Japan. The card contained a mixture of pro wrestling matches and mixed-martial arts fights, and the show was headlined by Yoshihiro Takayama defending the NWF Heavyweight Championship against Yuji Nagata, who also defended the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in a unification match. The show also featured participation from Pro Wrestling Noah, as Kenta Kobashi defended the GHC Heavyweight Championship against Masahiro Chono. The only other title match on the show featured Jushin Thunder Liger and Koji Kanemoto defending the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against Heat and Tiger Mask IV. Ultimate Crush featured 6 professional wrestling matches and 5 mixed martial arts fights contested under Vale Tudo rules, with a total of 11 matches on the card. Production = Background = In April 2002, Yoshihiro Takayama re-debuted in New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) by attacking Yuji Nagata after he had won the IWGP Heavyweight Championship from Tadao Yasuda in Nippon Budokan and began a long running feud with Nagata. Takayama quickly skyrocketed up the card and became one of the most well-known pro wrestlers in Japan thanks to his fights in Pride Fighting Championship. In 2002, Antonio Inoki declared the NWF Heavyweight Championship would return, and a tournament was set up throughout late 2002 and early 2003. At Wrestling World 2003, Takayama defeated Tsuyoshi Kosaka in the final of the tournament to win the vacant title. While Takayama was NWF Champion, Nagata had held the IWGP Heavyweight Championship for over a year. A unification match was later set up for Ultimate Crush, where the winner would get both belts. On January 10, 2003, Masahiro Chono debuted for Pro Wrestling Noah, teaming with Mitsuharu Misawa in a loss to Kenta Kobashi and Akira Taue in what was called a \\"dream match\\", pitting All Japan's top stars of the 1990s against New Japan's top villain of the 1990s. On April 13, Chono was in attendance to watch Kobashi successfully defend the GHC Heavyweight Championship against Tamon Honda at Ariake Coliseum, and after the match, was invited to ringside by Kobashi. Chono expressed his wish to challenge for the GHC Heavyweight Title in the Tokyo Dome on May 2, in what he called a \\"Mr. Pro Wrestling vs Mr. Pro Wrestling\\" match. In early 2003, Kazunari Murakami and the Makai Club began a feud with Michiyoshi Ohara's Crazy Dog's stable, with the two exchanging wins throughout the start of the year. On January 4, Ohara teamed with Shinsuke Nakamura to beat Murakami and Tadao Yasuda at Wrestling World 2003, and on March 21 Makai Club beat Crazy Dogs, however, Masahiro Chono came to their aid during a post match beatdown and helped the Crazy Dogs stuff Makai Club president Kantaro Hoshino into a doghouse, something that would become a trademark of the Crazy Dogs. During this time, Crazy Dogs recruited MMA fighter Enson Inoue to join the group and combat Kazunari Murakami, and a match was later set up to pit Murakami against Inoue in the Tokyo Dome. =Storylines= Ultimate Crush featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.  Results   Aftermath  After beating Nagata, Yoshihiro Takayama defended both the IWGP Heavyweight Championship and NWF Heavyweight Championship separately throughout the rest of 2003. He successfully defended the NWF title against Shinsuke Nakamura, Tadao Yasuda and Minoru Suzuki, and successfully defended the IWGP title against Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Masahiro Chono twice, including in a cage deathmatch. Takayama dropped the IWGP title to Tenzan on November 3, but retained the NWF title until January 4, 2004, when he lost to IWGP Heavyweight Champion Shinsuke Nakamura in a unification match, effectively retiring the NWF Heavyweight Championship once again. Enson Inoue and Kazunari Murakami would face off once more in June, with Inoue once again winning by referee stoppage. After the Crazy Dogs began to break up, Inoue primarily aligned himself with Yuji Nagata and the rest of the New Japan sekigun before leaving New Japan in early 2004.

The plant is notable for being one of the first in the U.S. built to a 1500 Volt system specification. The electricity is being sold to the Platte River Power Authority (PRPA) under a 25-year power purchase agreement. Facility details The plant occupies about distributed adjacent to PRPA's natural gas and coal-fired Rawhide Energy Station. It uses 117,120 polycrystalline silicon panels (Model SN-72cell: rated ~310 Wp, ~16% efficiency, 1500 Vdc isolation) that the manufacturer, S-Energy, claims are less susceptible to potential-induced degradation. The panels are mounted in rows onto single-axis trackers. The rows are organized into 12 blocks, and the electricity produced from each block is connected to the electric grid through a Samurai Series 1500 Vdc, 2700 kW / 2700 kVA inverter built by TMEIC. The boost in system voltage from the previous 1.0 kV standard to 1.5 kV enables the inverter to operate at higher efficiency and reliability, and is expected to reduce overall balance of system costs over the lifetime of the facility. The project was developed, constructed, and continues to be operated by Boulder-based juwi Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of the German renewable energy company juwi AG. Construction began in February 2016, and commercial operation began in October 2016. The project was financed and is owned by PSEG Solar Source, a subsidiary of New Jersey's Public Service Enterprise Group. The completed facility cost about US$54 million. On February 14, 2019 PRPA announced that it entered an agreement to add another 20 MW of solar photovoltaic generating capacity at the site, anticipated to be online in early 2020. The addition will include 2 MW of lithium-ion battery storage.

She continued her studies in Paris as a pupil of Edouard Nevellier. Brunton often painted views of markets on the continent in both oil paint and watercolour. In Paris, she exhibited a statute at the Salon des Artistes Francais in 1925 and coloured wood engravings at the Salon d'Automne in 1929 and 1930.

It is the third and last building of ‚ÄúThe Red Trilogy‚Äù (together with the Leicester Engineering Faculty building and the Cambridge History Faculty building), all of which are now listed.  History  Lord Florey The building was commissioned for The Queen's College by the then Provost of the college, Sir Howard Florey ‚Äî later Lord Florey of Adelaide ‚Äî who shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine for synthesising the drug penicillin for use, saving hundreds of thousands of lives in the aftermath of WWII. The Florey Building was named after the Provost, following his death during the week that building work commenced on site, in 1968. Florey sat on the committee in charge of choosing an architect for the project and became a leading advocate of Stirling's selection, despite Stirling not being popular with the some of the college's Governing Body. Florey and his supporters argued that the college needed \\"the best building by the best architect to attract the best students and also research funding\\", one that he said he did not want to be \\"boxy and dull but admired by architects.\\" Construction took place between 1968 and 1971. The completion date was almost a year and a half later than promised due delayed construction drawings to the contractors on site. The building was the third in Stirling's \\"Red Trilogy\\", and follows the earlier two in employing the same traditional red industrial bricks and tiles and non-bespoke factory-made glazing systems, as well as sculptural and unusual forms in the overall design. The buildings in the Red Trilogy were designed in reaction to austere and rectilinear post- war architecture and were seen at the time as exciting and dynamic. Further they were immediately hailed by the profession, and Stirling became internationally celebrated.  Design  The main structure consists of 11 reinforced concrete frames of irregular A shape placed at 7m spacings linked by spine beams at each floor. Red ceramic tiles clad the main structure and paving for the courtyard. Stirling's design was heavily influenced by the Bauhaus movement and uses bold and sculptural forms which make clear each part of the building's function. The building is set back from the road and designed in a horse shoe shape, with the open side facing north. All residential rooms feature floor-to-ceiling glazing, facing the inner court of the building. Only a few small windows face outward and are visible from the outside. This gives every room a view across the River Cherwell to the Angel and Greyhound Meadow beyond. There are 74 single rooms split over four levels, with a top level of double-height gallery rooms for graduates and one apartment for a Bachelor fellow. However, in recent years the building has been used exclusively to accommodate first year undergraduates, with a caretaker occupying the fellow's apartment. In addition to the bedrooms there is a common room and a dining hall with an associated kitchen. Heating to the rooms is provided by electric underfloor heating. Stirling initially recommended double glazing which would have significantly lowered energy consumption due to the vast amount of glass. The idea was rejected by the college on the grounds of cost but the rooms have since been retrofitted with double glazing to improve energy efficiency. The building was originally designed to be approached from the open side of the horse shoe, via a riverside walk and public path connecting to the Magdalen Bridge. This access route was never completed, however evidence of it can still be seen from the river. Access to the building is instead provided by what was intended to be the back entrance through a small car park, which links to St Clements. The exterior as seen from St Clement's.  Critical reception and controversy  In the book Modern Movements in Architecture, Charles Jencks writes of Stirling‚Äôs university buildings and praises him as ‚Äòthe best architect of his generation‚Äô. However, there were numerous problems in the process of constructing the building and Stirling's relationship with the college's governing body was strained. Stirling‚Äôs office was eventually sued by the Queen‚Äôs College because of problems encountered both during construction and after completion. As a result, Stirling‚Äôs office was unable to find work in England for at least a decade after the Florey building, instead finding promise of work in places like Germany, Japan, and the Unites States. The buildings themselves were seen as ugly and reactionary by many. In both Oxford and Cambridge, where the architectural vernacular involves the use of stone and other traditional materials, people rejected them even before they were occupied, with angry letters of complaint in the press. But it is notable that in industrial Leicester the engineering faculty was seen as much less controversial. The buildings were among the first examples of architecture to attract popular criticism in the way that modernist painting, music and literature had earlier in the 20th century. Particular criticism has been made of the Florey building because of its unattractiveness on the approach from St Clements, which was originally intended as the back entrance to the building. Though disliked by some members of the public, the building has been enjoyed by its student occupants who have praised the sociability of its design. Stirling's work has more recently been recognised for its contribution to post-war British architecture and his buildings are admired by architects and architectural students. The Royal Institute of British Architects named their annual RIBA Stirling Prize in his honour in 1996, considered to be the most prestigious architecture award in the United Kingdom. Though privately owned, the Florey building is frequently visited by architects from around the world.  Statutory Listing, Current Status and Future  In 1999 the building was first proposed for statutory protection from damaging alterations by listing as a building of special architectural and historic interest by the PostWar Steering Group of English Heritage. For reasons that are unclear their recommendation was not adopted Historic England Advice Report, Case Number 1449945, 27 February 2019, page 1 History of Listing Assessments. A decade later, Florey Building was listed at Grade II in 2009. An application for it to be upgraded, made by the C20 Society, was resisted by The Queen's College, who employed consultants to argue that the lower Grade II was appropriate.Historic England Advice Report, Case Number 1449945, 27 February 2019, page 2,Consultation However, the building was re-designated at Grade II* in December 2018. The college successfully sought planning permission to complete refurbishment work and add an annexe. These plans received criticism by local residents and architects alike for making significant changes to Stirling's original design. However, February 2019, the college has not implemented the planned work and the future of the building is currently uncertain. The building freehold is still owned by The Queen's College, but in the academic year 2018‚Äì19 Florey Building lies completely unoccupied.

He was eventually talked into making a confession. In his confession, Garcia admitted he was involved in the 1857 murders of the two Basque cattlemen and the theft of their horses and implicated Pio Linares and El Huero Rafael of doing the killings and also Jack Powers and Nieves Robles, known as ‚ÄúEduriquez‚Äù, as participants in the crime. His confession naming Jack Powers set off a police manhunt for Powers in San Francisco at the request of the San Luis Obispo Vigilance Committee. With the help of friends in the city Jack Powers escaped the city on a ship.

Early life Mao, whose real name is Wang Weijia, was born in October 1994 in Tailai County, Qiqihar, in Heilongjiang province of Northeast China. He studied nursing at Hangzhou Normal University and began his internship at a hospital in Hangzhou in 2016, his last year in university. To \\"ease the pressure\\" from work, which he found stressful, he played the guitar and began writing songs in his dormitory prior to appearing on The Coming One. Career =2017: The Coming One= Mao first came to attention after appearing as a contestant on the Tencent Video singing competition The Coming One (). He was noted for standing out from the other contestants, who wore costumes and makeup, for his \\"normality\\" and \\"round face, large glasses, and slightly crooked teeth\\". He also had very little prior experience in music. He had to record his introduction three times due to technical glitches, broke a guitar string as he began playing, and \\"gawked\\" at the celebrity judges when he first saw them, which was considered to contribute to his appeal amongst the public. The media began referring to him as \\"cute sang\\", a nod to the apparent lack of ambition and apathy of Chinese youth, and the Mandarin slang word for \\"frightened\\". In contrast to the \\"typical\\" songs about romance, Mao sang songs about \\"hopelessness, frustrated ambition, and his dreams of getting rich\\"; the title of his first song in the competition translates to \\"If I Become Very Rich One Day\\", which he wrote when he was working as a nursing intern and short of money. He won the competition on September 23, 2017, and \\"Xiao Chou\\" (Ê∂àÊÑÅ; Drown Your Sorrows), his song debuted during the competition, later stayed at the top of the QQ Music chart for 11 days, and was streamed over 500 million times.

In 1985 it became part of the Langebaan National Park, which was later renamed the West Coast National Park. On 25 April 1988 the Langebaan Ramsar site was declared. The MPA was proclaimed by the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, Mohammed Valli Moosa, in Government Gazette No. 21948 of 29 December 2000 in terms of section 43 of the Marine Living Resources Act, 18 of 1998.  Purpose  A marine protected area is defined by the IUCN as \\"A clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values\\". The saltmarshes of Langebaan are unique in South Africa in that no river feeds into the lagoon. They constitute roughly 32% of the entire saltmarsh habitat in the country. The salinity is relatively stable and the region supports dense populations of molluscs and crustaceans and a large variety of seaweeds. The lagoon is a nursery for juvenile fish, and supports about 55 000 water birds in summer, including 23 species of waders.  Extent  Approximately 65 km of coastline and 280 km2 of sea are protected by this MPA. = Boundaries = The MPA is bounded by the high-water mark in the Langebaan lagoon south of the northern boundary, which is a line from Leentjiesklip No.2, at S33¬∞03.707‚Ä≤, E018¬∞2.462', towards Salamander Point at S33¬∞04.323‚Ä≤, E017¬∞59.795‚Ä≤, until it meets the seaward boundary of the South African National Defence Force area, as demarcated by buoys shown on SAN Chart SC2, and then along this boundary to the yellow buoy east of Meeu Island at S33¬∞05.166, E018¬∞00.809‚Ä≤, and then to Perlemoen Point at S33¬∞05.590‚Ä≤, E048¬∞00,211' on the western shore of the lagoon. = Zonation = There are three zones in the lagoon. A controlled zone to the north where recreational fishing and power boating is allowed, a restricted zone, where no fishing is allowed and only non-powered vessels are permitted, and a sanctuary zone to the south where no access is allowed.  Restricted areas   Controlled areas   Management  The marine protected areas of South Africa are the responsibility of the national government, which has management agreements with a variety of MPA management authorities, in this case, SANParks , which manages the MPA with funding from the SA Government through the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA). The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is responsible for issuing permits, quotas and law enforcement.  Use   Geography  = Climate = The climate of the South-western Cape is markedly different from the rest of South Africa, which is a summer rainfall region, receiving most of its rainfall during the summer months of December to February. The South-western Cape has a Mediterranean type climate, with most of its rainfall during the winter months from June to September. During the summer the dominant factor determining the weather in the region is a high pressure zone, known as the South Atlantic High, located over the South Atlantic ocean to the west of the Cape coast. Winds circulating in an anticlockwise direction from such a system reach the Cape from the south-east, producing periods of up to several days of high winds and mostly clear skies. These winds keep the region relatively cool. Because of its south facing aspect Betty's Bay is exposed to these winds. Winter in the South- western Cape is characterised by disturbances in the circumpolar westerly winds, resulting in a series of eastward moving depressions. These bring cool cloudy weather and rain from the north west. The south westerly winds over the South Atlantic > = Seasonal variations in sea conditions =  Ecology  Marine ecoregions of the South African Exclusive Economic Zone: Langebaan Lagoon Marine Protected Area is in the Benguela ecoregion (describe position, biodiversity and endemism of the region) The MPA is in the warm temperate Benguela ecoregion to the west of Cape Point which extends northwards to the Orange River. There are a fairly large proportion of species endemic to South Africa along this coastline. Four major habitats exist in the sea in this region, distinguished by the nature of the substrate. The substrate, or base material, is important in that it provides a base to which an organism can anchor itself, which is vitally important for those organisms which need to stay in one particular kind of place. Rocky shores and reefs provide a firm fixed substrate for the attachment of plants and animals. Some of these may have Kelp forests, which reduce the effect of waves and provide food and shelter for an extended range of organisms. Sandy beaches and bottoms are a relatively unstable substrate and cannot anchor kelp or many of the other benthic organisms. Finally there is open water, above the substrate and clear of the kelp forest, where the organisms must drift or swim. Mixed habitats are also frequently found, which are a combination of those mentioned above. Rocky shores and reefs There are rocky reefs and mixed rocky and sandy bottoms. For many marine organisms the substrate is another type of marine organism, and it is common for several layers to co-exist. Examples of this are red bait pods, which are usually encrusted with sponges, ascidians, bryozoans, anemones, and gastropods, and abalone, which are usually covered by similar seaweeds to those found on the surrounding rocks, usually with a variety of other organisms living on the seaweeds. The type of rock of the reef is of some importance, as it influences the range of possibilities for the local topography, which in turn influences the range of habitats provided, and therefore the diversity of inhabitants. Sandstone and other sedimentary rocks erode and weather very differently, and depending on the direction of dip and strike, and steepness of the dip, may produce reefs which are relatively flat to very high profile and full of small crevices. These features may be at varying angles to the shoreline and wave fronts. There are fewer large holes, tunnels and crevices in sandstone reefs, but often many deep but low near- horizontal crevices. Kelp forests Kelp forests are a variation of rocky reefs, as the kelp requires a fairly strong and stable substrate which can withstand the loads of repeated waves dragging on the kelp plants. The Sea bamboo Ecklonia maxima grows in water which is shallow enough to allow it to reach to the surface with its gas-filled stipes, so that the fronds form a dense layer at or just below the surface, depending on the tide. The shorter Split-fan kelp Laminaria pallida grows mostly on deeper reefs, where there is not so much competition from the sea bamboo. Both these kelp species provide food and shelter for a variety of other organisms, particularly the Sea bamboo, which is a base for a wide range of epiphytes, which in turn provide food and shelter for more organisms. Sandy beaches and bottoms (including shelly, pebble and gravel bottoms) Sandy bottoms at first glance appear to be fairly barren areas, as they lack the stability to support many of the spectacular reef based species, and the variety of large organisms is relatively low. The sand is continually being moved around by wave action, to a greater or lesser degree depending on weather conditions and exposure of the area. This means that sessile organisms must be specifically adapted to areas of relatively loose substrate to thrive in them, and the variety of species found on a sandy or gravel bottom will depend on all these factors. Sandy bottoms have one important compensation for their instability, animals can burrow into the sand and move up and down within its layers, which can provide feeding opportunities and protection from predation. Other species can dig themselves holes in which to shelter, or may feed by filtering water drawn through the tunnel, or by extending body parts adapted to this function into the water above the sand. The open sea The pelagic water column is the major part of the living space at sea. This is the water between the surface and the top of the benthic zone, where living organisms swim, float or drift, and the food chain starts with phytoplankton, the mostly microscopic photosynthetic organisms that convert the energy of sunlight into organic material which feeds nearly everything else, directly or indirectly. In temperate seas there are distinct seasonal cycles of phytoplankton growth, based on the available nutrients and the available sunlight. Either can be a limiting factor. Phytoplankton tend to thrive where there is plenty of light, and they themselves are a major factor in restricting light penetration to greater depths, so the photosynthetic zone tends to be shallower in areas of high productivity. Zooplankton feed on the phytoplankton, and are in turn eaten by larger animals. The larger pelagic animals are generally faster moving and more mobile, giving them the option of changing depth to feed or to avoid predation, and to move to other places in search of a better food supply. = Marine species diversity =  Animals 23 species of wading birds. *29 species of bony fish *12 shark and ray species * sandshark Rhinobatos annulatus * Geelbek * Cape Stumpnose * Snoek * Yellowtail More than 400 species of marine invertebrates *Siphonaria *Assiminea globulus  Seaweeds  71 species of marine algae  Endemism  The MPA is in the warm temperate Benguela ecoregion to the west of Cape Point which extends northwards to the Orange River.

Dressed in bright orange reflective vests with \\"Shariah Police\\" printed on the back, the male patrollers loitered around discotheques and gambling houses, telling passers-by to refrain from gambling and alcohol. Wuppertal's police have pressed charges. A German Salafist posted on YouTube a propaganda video showing a poster with the English headline \\"Shariah Controlled Zone\\", followed by images of Salafists recruiting young people and visiting gambling houses. Joerg Rademacher, spokesman for the interior ministry, said the video was \\"a new provocation and part of the Salafist propaganda, which shows that the scene does not acknowledge Germany's rule of law\\". Officials of Northrhein-Westphalia say there are about 1,800 Salafists in the state, of whom 10 percent are considered to be violent extremists. Justice Minister, Heiko Maas, told Bild that \\"the state alone\\" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany, and any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated. The 33-year-old behind the Wuppertal patrols, former fireman and one of the leaders of the German Salafist movement Sven Lau, published a video on his website, claiming that the men involved had simply worn mock uniforms for a few hours and that \\"Sharia police\\" never existed. \\"We knew that this would raise attention,\\" Lau said, claiming that his goal was to spark a debate about Sharia law in Germany. Eight of the men involved in the patrols were later prosecuted under a law that bans wearing uniforms to convey a common political conviction. In November 2016, the court ruled that the actions of the \\"sharia police\\" was legal under Germany's free speech laws and that their orange vests were not \\"suggestively militant or intimidating\\" uniforms.

Personal life  B√∂ttger, married and childless, was a sales representative for a firm trading in jewelry and gems in M√ºnchen when he was called into military service in 1940; he entered the Dachua concentration camp guards' company in June 1940. By November he had left the company with an hitherto unknown destination, but he returned in May 1941 as a logistics officer, transferring to the camp administration's postal service in September 1941.

Biography Miln was born in Macomb, Illinois to Dr. T. M. Jordan, a local physician and Annie Wells. At age 5 the family moved to Chicago where her father became wealthy as a banker. She attended Vassar College but was forced to withdraw due to ill-health. At age 18, she began to act in plays in a travelling theatrical company which was run by her future husband, George Crichton Miln. She married him in 1888 and together they travelled to Australia. Her husband struggled to work as an actor and their life for a few years was lived in poverty. He eventually left for work in New Zealand leaving her behind in Sydney to take care of their three young children. After her father died, Miln came in to some income from his estate which allowed them to travel around Asia where they also performed in plays. Her travels inspired her to start writing which she did with two travel memoirs, When We Were Strolling Players In The East, (1894) and Quaint Korea, (1895). In 1896, they moved to London, England where they bought a monthly periodical called The British Realm, which George edited. Louise contributed many articles and continued writing. George died in 1917 and Miln continued her writing career. In 1920, she published a book entitled Mr. Wu, a romance between an American woman and a Chinese mandarin. The book was very popular and it was eventually made into a film starring Lon Chaney. This led to 15 more novels, mainly romances set in China which sold well at the time. One of her books, The Green Goddess, is based on a play by William Archer about a shangri-la type place in South America where immortality is on offer. She purchased a house in Trepied, France, just across the channel where she died in 1933.

It was completed in 1649 during the Portuguese Restoration War (1640-1668), as part of the fortifications of Lisbon that stretched from Cabo da Roca on the Atlantic coast to Bel√©m Tower close to Lisbon. It could exchange crossfire with the Fort of S√£o Bruno to its east. History The fort, which is relatively small, was built on a rocky outcrop into the Tagus estuary in a Mannerist style. It has a pentagonal outline, with the roof covered by a terrace, with two circular bartizans. There are six gaps in the walls for gun emplacements. Using the site of an earlier artillery battery, the Fort of Giribita was rebuilt and enlarged as a result of a decision of the Council of War created by King John IV. Work was supervised by Ant√≥nio Lu√≠s de Meneses, 1st Marquis of Marialva and was completed in 1649, according to the inscription on the entrance. By 1735 a report noted that the fort had just two pieces of artillery, with a further five not fit for service. In 1763 it was reportedly armed with 7 cannon but by 1824 the functioning artillery was again back to just two pieces. During the Portuguese Civil War (1828-1834) the Fort of Giribita was armed with 22 gunners and seven cannon. In 1873 work began on restoration and in 1877 the fort was assigned to the Defence Commission of Lisbon, which used it as a deposit for torpedo material, a function which it still exercised in 1911, the first year of the First Portuguese Republic after the 5 October 1910 revolution. Some repairs were carried out in 1911. In 1942 it was handed over to the Ministry of Finance. Prior to that, its surrounding environment had been completely changed by construction of the EN6 highway, known as the Marginal, connecting Lisbon with Cascais along the river and coastline, which passes within a few metres of the fort. After the Carnation Revolution in 1974, it was handed over to the Directorate of Naval Infrastructure in 1975.

During RCCI combustion, well-mixed low-reactivity fuel and oxidizer (typically air) are compressed but not reaching auto-ignition. Later, still during compression cycle, high-reactivity fuel is injected to form a local mixture of low- and high-reactivity fuel. Finally the whole fuel charge is ignited near top dead center of the piston by injection of high-reactivity fuel. The RCCI combustion process requires two different fuels. Low-reactivity fuel gets injected into the intake ports with low pressure during the intake stroke. High-reactivity fuel gets injected into the cylinder with high pressure at the end of compression stroke. A throttle characteristic to Otto engines is not needed. Because of compression ignition and lack of throttle control, RCCI resembles much the diesel process. The dual-fuel RCCI can produce ultra-low NOx and soot emissions and higher thermal efficiency compared to conventional diesel combustion .

This was the first major breach in the truce negotiated by the IRA and British government back in February 1975. The attack took place in Forkhill which was right on the Irish border and a safe haven for IRA Volunteers from South Armagh. The attack On the 17 July 1975 Major Peter Willis, the Green Howards company commander in Crossmaglen was accompanied by three British soldiers, all of whom were bomb disposal experts.Toby Harnden - Bandit Country: The IRA & South Armagh pp.58 They were investigating a milk churn at Cortreasla Bridge in Tullydonnell. They walked through a gap in a hedge which was next to a signpost. As they passed through the hedge an IRA Volunteer pressed a button which sent an electric current through an almost 400-yard long command wire which detonated a bomb which had an estimated between 70 - 80lbs of explosives in a beer keg which was very large for IRA bombs at that stage. All of four soldiers were killed instantly with another soldier injured by shrapnel.Toby Harnden - Bandit Country: The IRA & South Armagh pp.58 The soldiers killed were Major Peter Willis (37), Edward Garside (34), Robert McCarter (33) and Calvert Brown (25). They were the first British soldiers to die at the hand of the IRA since the February truce. Aftermath The IRA claimed in statement that the attack had been in revenge for the killing of two of their own Volunteers. British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Merlyn Rees, issued a statement condemning those responsible for the killings. Evntually an IRA Volunteer called Pat Thompson was convicted of the attack in March 1976 in which Thompson signed a statement saying that the Crossmaglen IRA unit was the unit who planned and carried out the attack. Thompson maintains however that he was forced to sign the statement after bad beatings & threats to his family.

The current Neoclassical main building was built for Georg Frederik Ditlev Ko√´s in 1775. It was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1950. A half-timbered barn from 1864 is also listed. History =Pebringegaard= The estate was originally called Pebringegaard. It is first mentioned in 1372 when Clemend Sen√¶ granted it to Antvorskov Abbey. It was later owned by the Hvass family. Niels Hvas is mentioned as the owner in 1404. It was later acquired by the crown. Lauritz Nielsen was lensmann from 1642. The main building was destroyed in a fire in 1648. In 1663, it was acquired by Jens Ebbesen, the bailiff of Antvorskov, but after a while reverted to the crown. In 1674, Christian V granted it to Henrik Thott. It later went to his daughter, Sophie Thott. In 1675, she gave it to Hans Carstens√∏n. It was then most likely reacquired by its former owner, Jens Ebbesen, since his widow in 1698 sold it to Frederik von Korff. In 1705, Frederik IV used a buy-Back Clause to reacquire the estate. In 1717, it was included in Antvorskov Cavalry District. =Georg Frederik Ditlev Ko√´s and later owners= Georg Frederik Ditlev Ko√´s In 1774, Antvorskov and Pebringegaard was acquired by Georg Ditlev Frederik K√∂es. He renamed Pebringegaard Falkensteen after his wife, Anna Mathea Falck. Ko√´s was originally from Preussia but had later moved to Copenhagen where he established a lottery (tallotteriet). =19th century= In 1794, Ko√´s chose to sell his Danish estates to Magnus von Dernath. In 1799, he sold Falkensteen to Constantin Brun, a wealthy merchant from Copenhagen. In 1806, Brun sold the estate to Adam Wilhelm Hauch and Marcus Frederik Voigt. Ludvig Manthey: The owner from 1812 to 1842 In 1809 it was acquired by Marcus Bech. In 1811, he sold it to professor of law at the University of Copenhagen Johan Frederik Vilhelm Schlegel who next year ceded it to Ludvig Manthey in exchange for S√∏ller√∏dgaard in S√∏ller√∏d north of Copenhagen. Manthey had recently given up his positions as director of the Royal Porcelain Manufactory and manager of √òrholm and Brede Works. He kept the estate until his death in 1842 and was buried in the local Gerlev Cemetery. Falkensteen was then acquired by Lars Trolle, who in 1846 ceded it to Peter Adolf Henrik Stampe. In 1852, Falkensteen was acquired by Jacob Jacobsen. =20th and 21st centuries= In 1897, Jacobsen's heirs sold Falkensteen to Frederik Wilhelm Treschow. Treschow sold it when he inherited Brahesborg on Funen after his father in 1811. The new owner was Carl A. N. Lawaetz. The estate has since then remained in the hands of the Lawaetz family. Architecture The main building is from 1775 and was built with brick from Antvorskov Abbey. The rather unassuming, single- storey building is 11 bays long and has a hipped red tile roof.

Both are still unsolved as of 2020. Invariants conjecture The first conjecture was proposed in 1976 and concerns Iwasawa invariants. This conjecture is related to Vandiver's conjecture, Leopoldt's conjecture, Birch‚ÄìTate conjecture, all of which are also unsolved. The conjecture, also referred to as Greenberg's invariants conjecture, firstly appeared in Greenberg's Princeton University thesis of 1971 and originally stated that, assuming that F is a totally real number field and that F_\\\\infty/F is the cyclotomic \\\\mathbb{Z}_p-extension, \\\\lambda(F_\\\\infty/F) = \\\\mu(F_\\\\infty/F) = 0, i.e. the power of p dividing the class number of F_n is bounded as n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty. Note that if Leopoldt's conjecture holds for F and p, the only \\\\mathbb{Z}_p-extension of F is the cyclotomic one (since it is totally real). In 1976, Greenberg expanded the conjecture by providing more examples for it and slightly reformulated it as follows: given that k is a finite extension of \\\\mathbf{Q} and that \\\\ell is a fixed prime, with consideration of subfields of cyclomtomic extensions of k, one can define a tower of number fields k = k_0 \\\\subset k_1 \\\\subset k_2 \\\\subset \\\\cdots \\\\subset k_n \\\\subset \\\\cdots such that k_n is a cyclic extension of k of degree \\\\ell^n. If k is totally real, is the power ofl dividing the class number of k_n bounded as n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty? Now, if k is an arbitrary number field, then there exist integers \\\\lambda, \\\\mu and u such that the power of \\\\ell dividing the class number of k_n is \\\\ell^{e_n}, where e_n = {\\\\lambda}n + \\\\mu^{\\\\ell_n} + u for all sufficiently large n. The integers \\\\lambda, \\\\mu, u depend only on k and \\\\ell. Then, we ask: is \\\\lambda = \\\\mu = 0 for k totally real? Simply speaking, the conjecture asks whether we have \\\\mu_\\\\ell(k) = \\\\lambda_\\\\ell(k) = 0 for any totally real number field k and any prime number \\\\ell, or the conjecture can also be reformulated as asking whether both invariants Œª and ¬µ associated to the cyclotomic Z_p-extension of a totally real number field vanish. In 2001, Greenberg generalized the conjecture (thus making it known as Greenberg's pseudo-null conjecture or, sometimes, as Greenberg's generalized conjecture): Supposing that F is a totally real number field and that p is a prime, let \\\\tilde{F} denote the compositum of all \\\\mathbb{Z}_p-extensions of F. Let \\\\tilde{L} denote the pro-p Hilbert class field of \\\\tilde{F} and let \\\\tilde{L} = \\\\operatorname{Gal}(\\\\tilde{F}/\\\\tilde{L}), regarded as a module over the ring \\\\tilde{\\\\Lambda} = {\\\\mathbb{Z}_p}\\\\operatorname{Gal}(\\\\tilde{F}/F). Then \\\\tilde{X} is a pseudo-null \\\\tilde{\\\\Lambda}-module. A possible reformulation: Let \\\\tilde{k} be the compositum of all the \\\\mathbb{Z}_p-extensions of k and let \\\\operatorname{Gal}(\\\\tilde{k}/k) \\\\simeq \\\\mathbb{Z}^n_p, then Y_\\\\tilde{k} is a pseudo-null \\\\Lambda_n-module. Another related conjecture (also unsolved as of yet) exists: We have \\\\mu_\\\\ell(k) = 0 for any number field k and any prime number \\\\ell. This related conjecture was justified by Bruce Ferrero and Larry Washington, both of whom proved (see: Ferrero‚ÄìWashington theorem) that \\\\mu_\\\\ell(k) = 0 for any abelian extension k of the rational number field \\\\mathbb{Q} and any prime number \\\\ell. p-rationality conjecture Another conjecture, which can be referred to as Greenberg's conjecture, was proposed by Greenberg in 2016, and is known as Greenberg's p-rationality conjecture that states that for any odd prime p and for any t, there exist a p-rational field K such that \\\\operatorname{Gal}(K/\\\\mathbb{Q}) \\\\cong (\\\\mathbb{Z}/\\\\mathbb{2Z})^t.
