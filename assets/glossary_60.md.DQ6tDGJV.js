It is governed by Asansol Municipal Corporation Geography Location Kulti is located at latitude 23¬∞43'60N and longitude 86¬∞50'60E at an elevation of 114 meters. Asansol is composed of undulating laterite soil. This area lies between two mighty rivers ‚Äì the Damodar and the Ajay. They flow almost parallel to each other in the region ‚Äì the average distance between the two rivers is around 30 km. For ages the area was heavily forested and infested with plunderers and marauders. The discovery of coal in the 18th century led to industrialisation of the area and most of the forests have been cleared.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, Bardhaman Jelar Itihas O Lok Sanskriti (History and Folk lore of Bardhaman District.), , Vol I, pp 14-15, Radical Impression. At the western fringe of the area the Barakar River forms the boundary with Jharkhand. Urbanisation As per the 2011 census, 83.33% of the population of Asansol Sadar subdivision was urban and 16.67% was rural. Asansol Sadar subdivision has 26 (+1 partly) Census Towns.(partly presented in the map alongside; all places marked on the map are linked in the full-screen map). Asansol Municipal Corporation According to the Kolkata Gazette notification of 3 June 2015, the municipal areas of Kulti, Raniganj and Jamuria were included within the jurisdiction of Asansol Municipal Corporation. *For language details see Salanpur (community development block)#Language and religion Police station Kulti police station has jurisdiction over parts of Asansol Municipal Corporation. The area covered is 96 km2 and the population covered is 310,000. History Kulti railway station at Asansol IISCO Plant Earlier a small village, Kulti has grown around the IISCO plant for more than a century. The plant has many historical achievements to its credit: India's first blast furnace was built way back in 1870, when even in the industrially developed countries there were few blast furnaces. That open-top blast furnace used coal instead of charcoal for the first time, thereby introducing modern metallurgy to India. The furnace was in operation from 1875 till the fifties when it was dismantled, as the plant at Burnpur was expanded. Steel was made for the first time in India in 1904, in open hearth furnaces. The furnace lost out to the cheap steel dumped into the country from England. Steel making withered away and Kulti remained an iron making plant with numerous foundries producing a wide range of intricate castings. Large castings and large diameter cast iron pipes produced at Kulti for more than century are still being used at many places throughout the country. Technological obsolescence and vast changes in the process of steelmaking forced the closure of the foundries. Spun pipes were produced for the first time in India by the centrifugal casting process in 1942. Even when other plants came up, Kulti continued to have a national market share of 50-70%. While technological obsolescence ate away its roots, unfair market practices finally forced it to down its shutters. This plant was forcibly closed by connivance of Factory Unions, Politicians and Private Sector Steel Manufacturers. In 2003, the plant was closed down with voluntary retirement to most of the workers. In 2007, the IISCO plant was amalgamated with SAIL and has been revived as SAIL Growth Works,Kulti. In 2010, the Public Sector Undertaking of Ministry of Railways namely RITES Limited signed a joint venture agreement with the Public Sector Undertaking of Ministry of Steel namely Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) for setting up a wagon manufacturing factory in joint venture at Kulti in the premises of SAIL Growth Works,Kulti. Administration As per orders of the Delimitation Commission, 282 Kulti assembly constituency covers Kulti municipality. Kulti assembly segment is part of Asansol (Lok Sabha constituency).

History  Ratzeburg was one of the dioceses formed c. 1050 by Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg, who appointed St. Aristo, who had just returned from Jerusalem, to the new see. Aristo seems to have been but a wandering missionary bishop. In 1066, the pagan Wends rose against their German masters, and on 15 July 1066, St. Ansverus, Abbot of St. George's, Ratzeburg (not the later monastery bearing that name), and several of his monks are said to have been stoned to death. It was not until 1154, however, that Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony, and Hartwich I, Archbishop of Hamburg, refounded the episcopal see of Ratzeburg, and Evermodus became its first bishop. A disciple of St Norbert and provost of the Monastery of Our Lady at Magdeburg, Evermodus was, like many of his successors, a Premonstratensian canon. In 1157, a chapter was attached to Ratzeburg cathedral by Pope Adrian IV. Cathedral of Ratzeburg In 1236 Bishop Peter was invested by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, with temporal jurisdiction over the land of Butin and a number of villages outside it (the Principality of Ratzeburg), making the see a prince-bishopric. The succeeding prince-bishops retained this jurisdiction in spite of the frequent attempts which the dukes of Saxe-Lauenburg made to deprive them of it. The cathedral of Ratzeburg dates from the beginning of the 12th century. It was restored, and additions were made to it in the 15th century. The cathedral and pertaining premises such as the chapter and further episcopal manors formed the cathedral immunity district, an extraterritorial enclave of the Prince-Bishopric of Ratzeburg within the city of Ratzeburg, else belonging to Saxe-Lauenburg. The diocese also contained a number of other beautiful churches at M√∂lln, Wismar, B√ºchen and elsewhere. Besides the cathedral chapter of Ratzeburg with its provost or dean and twelve canons, there were in the diocese the Benedictine Abbeys of St. George, Ratzeburg (refounded in 1093), and of Wismar, where Benedictines expelled from L√ºbeck founded a monastery in 1239; also monasteries of women of the same order at Eldena founded in 1229, by Bishop Gottschalk of Ratzeburg, and burnt in 1290, at Rehna founded in 1237 by Prince-Bishop Ludolfus, and at Zarrentin founded in 1243. There were also Franciscans (1251) and Dominicans (1293) at Wismar. Ratzeburg Cathedral interior In 1504, during the episcopate of Prince-Bishop Johann V von Parkentin, the Premonstratensian regular canons of Ratzeburg cathedral were, with papal consent, made secular canons. Georg von Blumenthal, the last Catholic Prince-Bishop (1490-1550) Prince-Bishop Georg von Blumenthal (1524‚Äì50), who feuded with Thomas Aderpul, was the last Catholic bishop. In 1552, the cathedral was plundered by Count Volrad von Mansfeld. In 1554, the dean and chapter converted to Lutheranism. The cathedral is a proto-cathedral since and is owned by a Lutheran congregation within the North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church. Also most other churches in the former diocesan territory house Lutheran congregations today belonging to the North Elbian or the Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Mecklenburg. After 1554 the now Lutheran chapter elected Lutheran princes, lacking any canonical qualification, as administrators of the prince-bishopric. The capitulars deliberately ignored the ducal Saxe-Lauenburgian candidates, sons of the duke, fearing the prince-bishopric would then be incorporated into Saxe-Lauenburg. The prince-bishopric was then secularized by the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, becoming the Principality of Ratzeburg under the control of the Dukes of Mecklenburg. In 1701 the principality became an exclave of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. By the beginning of the 20th century, the diocesan historical territory in the German Empire corresponded to the district of Duchy of Lauenburg (in Schleswig-Holstein), the bishop's own Principality of Ratzeburg in the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and the western part of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, including Wismar but not Schwerin. The whole of it was later included in the Diocese of Osnabr√ºck and forms since January 7, 1995 part of the new Catholic Archdiocese of Hamburg, with most of today's Catholic churches in the region built since the 19th century. It has been suggested that the Raseborg Castle in Finland has been named after the Bishopric of Ratzeburg.

[Reykjav√≠k], p. 187-189. employed by the Icelandic Coast Guard during the latter two Cod Wars to cut the trawling wires of foreign fishing trawlers working within the then newly claimed Exclusive Fisheries zones. They were invented by Commander P√©tur Sigur√∞sson, Director of the Coast Guard, with assistance from Fri√∞rik Teitsson from the Icelandic lighthouse institution and T√≥mas Sigur√∞sson, who were both ironmongers. The invention was known as the trawlwire cutter, and was tested in 1958‚Äîbut not used until 5 September 1972, after every Icelandic ship had been equipped with it. The first net cutting On September 5, 1972, at 10:25 ICGV √Ügir, under Cdr. Gu√∞mundur Kj√¶rnested's command, encountered an unmarked trawler fishing northeast of Hornbanki. The master of this black- hulled trawler refused to divulge the trawler's name and number, and, after being warned to follow the Coast Guard's orders, played Rule, Britannia! over the radio. At 10:40 the net cutter was deployed into the water for the first time and √Ügir sailed along the trawler's port side. The fishermen tossed a thick nylon rope into the water as the patrol ship closed in, attempting to disable its propeller. After passing the trawler, √Ügir veered to the trawler's starboard side. The net cutter, behind the patrol vessel, sliced one of the trawling wires. As ICGV √Ügir came about to circle the unidentified trawler, its angry crew threw coal as well as garbage and a large fire axe at the Coast Guard vessel. A considerable amount of swearing and shouting came through the radio, which resulted in the trawler being identified as Peter Scott (H103). Other users How net cutters used. Net cutters have not only been used by the Icelandic Coast Guard. The Norwegian Coast Guard has had the net cutters in its inventory for a long time and has successfully used them against Icelandic trawlers near Svalbard. However, during the first Norwegian usage of the net cutters they were employed on a small inflatable boat and were not as effective as on a full size patrol ship, resulting in one set of net cutters being \\"captured\\" by the Icelandic trawler. Shortly afterwards Icelandic coast guard officials made comments about the net cutters being \\"Used in a wrong manner\\",. The Norwegian Coast Guard heeded this and as a result did not employ inflatable boats with net cutters. The Norwegian net cutters had also been slightly modified, and some speculations arose in Icelandic media as to the legality of other users of net cutters. The Brazilian Navy used some of their own designed net cutters during Lobster War in 1961‚Äì63, against French fishing ships off Brazilian waters.

This was the first in Arbuckle's series of films with the Comique Film Corporation, and Keaton's film debut.  Plot  Fatty, a butcher boy in a country store, is in love with Almondine (Alice Lake), the daughter of the store's general manager Mr. Grouch. Fatty's attempts to get close to her are sidetracked when the store's clerk Alum (Al St. John), a rival for Alice's affections, starts a fight with the rotund butcher. Their confrontation in the store soon involves a customer (Buster Keaton) as well as Grouch. The resulting mayhem includes small bags of flour being hurled and \\"exploding\\", pies being tossed, and brooms being wildly swung amid the thick clouds of flour lingering in the air. Determined to marry Almondine, Fatty disguises himself as a female cousin and follows her to an all-girls boarding school. Unfortunately, Alum has the same idea and masquerades, too, as a female student. After another fight breaks out between Fatty and Alum, Fatty is taken by the school's principal Miss Teachem to a separate room to be punished. Meanwhile, Alum and his accomplices (Keaton and Joe Bordeaux) attempt to kidnap Almondine. Luckily, Fatty's dog Luke distracts the gang while Fatty and Almondine escape. Once outside, the couple see a sign on a tree identifying a nearby parsonage, so they run off arm-in- arm to get married there. Note that the subtitles in a later release of The Butcher Boy cite new names for the characters: Alum is \\"Slim Snavely\\" and Almondine is \\"Amanda\\".\\"The Butcher Boy (1917) - 1st Buster Keaton Movie Appearance - Fatty Arbuckle\\", posted by Change Before Going Productions, available for viewing by the general public on the video-sharing service YouTube, a subsidiary of Alphabet, Inc., Mountain View, California.

Those involved in its creation included longtime opponents of President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal as well as former supporters who had come to believe its programs were proving ineffective.  Background  The Conservative Manifesto is an economic plan that was based on a set of beliefs that were relatively universal to conservatives on both the Democrat and Republican sides of the aisle of in 1937 and heavily influenced the conservative platform going forward from this point. It was first expressed by a number of conservative Republicans and Democrats who were concerned with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal plan for solving the Great Depression believing it was steering the country towards collectivism. However, most have reportedly denied involvement and so the responsibility was taken up by Josiah Bailey, a congressman from North Carolina. The document was leaked to the public by the New York Times, in this case two reporters named Joseph Alsop and Robert Kitner During its initial leak by the New York Times it was seen as anti-New Deal, and there is some level of truth to this. Its original intent was to convince Roosevelt that there needed to be some level of balance between enterprise and government and that there was some bipartisan opposition to Roosevelt's New Deal as it was being implemented up until this point. Ultimately the Manifesto was delivered to the people of the United States through a document called \\"An address to the People of the United States\\" on December 19, 1937.  Provisions  #Immediate revision of taxes on capital gains and undistributed profits in order to free investment funds. #Reduced expenditures to achieve a balanced budget, and thus, to still fears deterring business expansion. #An end to coercion and violence in relations between capital and labor. #Opposition to \\"unnecessary\\" government competition with private enterprise. #Recognition that private investment and enterprise require a reasonable profit. #Safeguarding the collateral upon which credit rests. #Reduction of taxes, or if this proved impossible at the moment, firm assurance of no further increases. #Maintenance of state rights, home rule, and local self- government, except where proved definitely inadequate. #Economical and non- political relief to unemployed with maximum local responsibility. #Reliance upon the American form of government and the American system of enterprise.  Josiah Bailey  Josiah Bailey was the leader of the conservatives that drafted the Conservative Manifesto. He was a Senator from North Carolina from 1931 to his death in 1946 and served on the committee of commerce and the committee of claims. He was a member of the North Carolina Constitutional Commission, United States Collector of Internal Revenue for North Carolina. He was an editor with the Biblical Recorder, and was a practitioner of law that was admitted to the bar in 1908. He was the only name to actually be applied to the conservative manifesto as he was the only one to not deny his involvement and openly state his support before his official address.  The New Deal  The New Deal was an economic plan put forth by Franklin Roosevelt that was notable in the speed by which it reacted to problems but heavily criticized by opponents the method by which it went about solving those problems which could be seen as hasty. The New Deal: * Closed many of the weaker banks in the country and halted the export of gold from the U.S. * Created the Agricultural Adjustment Administration in 1933 in order to manipulate prices by buying and holding food, as well as providing subsidies for low production among farmers. * Created the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1933 to created a hydroelectric project on the Tennessee River. * Created the National Recovery Administration in order to regulate competition amongst businesses (declared unconstitutional in 1935). * Created the Federal Emergency Relief Administration in order to create state and local jobs. * Created the Civilian Conservation Corps to put people to work on natural resource projects. * Passed the Wagner Act allowing workers to collectively bargain A.K.A. form unions. * Passed the Social Security Act in order to provide welfare for minors, the disabled, and the elderly. * Passed the Housing Act to give funds for low income housing. * Passed the Fair Labor Standards in order to institute the standard work week and the national minimum wage. There were also many other pieces of legislature passed beyond these but these are the major laws passed and organizations created.  Events leading up to the Conservative Manifesto  Josiah Bailey was an influential member of the Southern Democratic Conservative Party and had been a United States Senator for North Carolina since 1931. He wished to answer the growing needs of the public while adhering to the traditional values of individualism, hard work, self-help, balanced budgets, strong local governments and administrative efficiency. Bailey respected Roosevelt as a leader and recognized that while Roosevelt intended to be moderate in order to attempt to not fracture the nation but believed that the struggles of the Great Depression was causing him to abandon the conservatives of both parties. He also believed that Roosevelt was experimenting without much thought to economic theory and that he would go too far and cause more harm than good. Josiah Bailey started out his term in the United States Senate being a weak objector of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He later claimed that this was simply an act so that he may get re-elected and eventually go on the offensive. Bailey agreed with the idea behind the New Deal: to promote enterprise but crack down on extreme corporate profits. It wasn't until he saw Roosevelt begin to build a new party around himself that Bailey began to start making his own move with the manifesto.  Repercussions  Bailey's Conservative Manifesto created a marked change in how politics worked, particularly in the South. This piece consolidated conservative efforts in order to halt further New Deal legislation. This ultimately led to a downturn of Roosevelt's power in congress as more of his policy were denied as the country entered the \\"Roosevelt Recession\\", a downturn of the economy that had been looming for the better part of a year, that Roosevelt thought would blow over relatively quickly. As for the president himself, he was decidedly against the ideas of the conservative manifesto as he attempted to break through the conservative wall against the New Deal policy. On top of that, there is an opinion amongst those that support FDR's New Deal policy even to this day that this has caused a dramatic slowing of human and civil rights that was started by many of the policies that FDR started. While it does seem that the policies have been pulled back at least a little over the course of the years, perhaps in part due to this manifesto, there is still a large amount of debate today over how much these types of policies that FDR introduced should be implemented and the evolution of this ideology still challenge them to this day.

Kurduvadi is a railway junction where one major railway track between Wadi and Daund and a branch line track between Latur Road and Miraj intersect. The track from Daund continues to Pune and Mumbai towards west and to Manmad towards north-northwest. The branch line from Latur towards east of Kurduvadi connects Miraj in south-southwest and was called Barshi Light Railway as it was a narrow gauge track. Solapur lies southeast of Kurduvadi and connects to Bijapur. A part of the narrow gauge Barshi Light Railway track from Kurduvadi to Pandharpur (52 km) was converted to broad gauge in 2001. The narrow-gauge track from Pandharpur to Miraj was converted to broad gauge in 2010. The converted broad gauge track was commissioned in the last quarter of 2010 for freight trains and February 2011 for passenger trains. Now trains run on the broad gauge track from Miraj to Kurduvadi. These include trains from Miraj to Parbhani and from Kolhapur to Solapur via Miraj. The converted Miraj-Kurduvadi railway line has shortened the railway distance between Kolhapur, Solapur and Parbhani.

The Shukhov Tower on the Oka River (also Dzerzhinsk High-Voltage Mast, Shukhov Oka Tower) is the world‚Äôs only diagrid hyperboloid transmission tower. It is located in Russia, in the western suburbs of Nizhny Novgorod, on the left bank of the Oka River near Dzerzhinsk (about 12 km away from the city center, near Dachny village). The tower is one of several structures designed by Russian engineer and scientist Vladimir Shukhov; its power lines, however, were decommissioned in 1989. History The Shukhov Tower was a part of a 110kV three-phase AC transmission line crossing the Oka River commissioned between 1927 and 1929. For the Oka River crossing, six hyperboloid pylons (three for each power-line) were built: a tall anchor pylon, a tall crossing pylon on the hillier south shore, and a tall crossing pylon on the lower terrain of the north shore. In 1989, the power line was rerouted and the 20 and 68 metre pylons were dismantled. The 128 metre pylons were left intact as a monument. Today, only one of the 128-metre pylons stands as the other was illegally demolishedp.3, ¬´St√§hlerne Grazie am Strand der Oka¬ª, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 22.06.2005 for steel scrap in May 2005. Structure The Shukhov Tower consists of five steel lattice hyperboloid sections, stacked on top of each other. The sections are made of straight profiles, the ends of which rest against circular foundations. The tower's circular concrete foundation has a diameter of . The construction of the individual sections is an example of a doubly-ruled surface. Present condition RAO UES, Russia's electricity company, used Shukhov's unique constructions for 70 years. The existing pylon currently requires maintenance and FGC UES is scheduled to repair it. Partially-hyperboloid pylons of similar design can be seen near C√°diz, Spain.

The finding of her lifeless body on a public beach near Torvajanica, on Rome's littoral, led to prolonged investigations involving sensational allegations of drug and sex orgies in Roman society. The alleged involvement of Ugo Montagna and Piero Piccioni (son of deputy prime minister, Attilio Piccioni and lover of actress Alida Valli) caused a scandal. Subsequently they were absolved of all charges. The case remains unsolved, including the cause of death. Discovery of the body and murder investigation The discovery Saturday, April 11, 1953, the day before Easter, the body of Wilma Montesi was discovered on the beach of Torvaianica, near Rome. Aged 21 she had been missing since April 9. Wilma Montesi was born in 1932 in Rome, where she lived in via Tagliamento. At the time of her disappearance, she was engaged to a policeman from Potenza whom she was about to marry. She was considered to be very beautiful and longed to enter the world of cinema and show-business at Rome's Cinecitt√† film studios (she made an uncredited appearance in Prison, Ergastolo, 1952). Everyone described her as reserved and noble, intent on finishing the trousseau for her forthcoming wedding, planned for the next Christmas. The body was found by a labourer, Fortunato Bettini, who was having breakfast at the beach. The body was lying on its back on the shore, the head immersed in water. The young woman was partially dressed and the clothes were soaked with water: she was no longer wearing her shoes, skirt, stockings, and garter belt, and her handbag was missing. Initial evidence  When the news of the discovery was disclosed, newspapers came out with extensive articles, although the investigators had banned the press access to the mortuary where the body of the victim was kept. However a reporter of Rome's Il Messaggero, Fabrizio Menghini, managed to gain access and to see the body. The description he provided appeared in the paper the next day and it allowed her father, Rodolfo Montesi, to show up to identify the body. From a reconstruction of Montesi's final hours, it emerged that the young woman had not returned home for dinner on the evening of April 9, contrary to her habits. Her mother, along with her other daughter, Wanda, had spent the afternoon at the cinema watching Renoir's The Golden Coach and stated that Wilma had declined to join them because she was not keen in films featuring Anna Magnani, adding that she would probably go out for a walk. After returning home, the two women noticed that Wilma was not there; strangely she had left home without her identification and some jewellery, gifts from her boyfriend she usually wore when she went out. The caretaker of the building in which the Montesis lived claimed to have seen her going out at around 5:30, and not to have seen her again. Some witnesses claimed to have seen Montesi on the train from Rome to Ostia: Ostia is around 20 km from Torvaianica, too far to travel on foot, especially by someone not familiar with the area. The owner of a kiosk selling postcards located near the beach at Ostia claimed to have spoken with a young woman apparently resembling Montesi, who had bought an illustrated postcard and intended to send it to her boyfriend in Potenza. The exclusion of suicide option and the closure of the case The body was brought to the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rome, where an autopsy was conducted: the doctors claimed that the probable cause of death was a \\"syncope due to a foot bath,\\" claiming that, most likely, Montesi took the chance of the trip to the beach to eat ice cream (remains were found in her stomach) and made a foot bath in the sea to relieve a nagging irritation at the heels of which she suffered for some time. To do so, Montesi would put off her shoes and socks and, most likely, also skirt and suspenders, and then she dived in the water where she fainted and finally drowned. The coroner reconnected her sudden illness to the fact that the woman was menstruating. The distance between Ostia (the presumed last sighting of Montesi) and the point of the discovery was justified by saying that the body had been moved by complex combinations of sea currents. An autopsy revealed that the young woman was a virgin and that she had not experienced violence (as evidenced by the fact that the make up was still on her face and nail varnish on her fingernails intact); later, however, another doctor, Professor Pellegrini, said that the presence of sand in her intimate parts could be explained only as a consequence of violence. No traces of drugs or alcohol were found in her body. The scandal The press involvement The accident theory was considered reliable by the police, who closed the case. However, newspapers were sceptical. On May 4, the Naples monarchist newspaper Roma, suggested the hypothesis of a plot to cover up the real killers, probably some powerful personalities from politics; the hypothesis was presented in the article \\"Why are the police are silent on the death of Wilma Montesi?\\", by journalist Riccardo Giannini, who had a large following. This hypothesis was shared by prestigious national newspapers such as Corriere della Sera and Paese Sera, and by small gossip magazines such as Attualit√†, but the main actor was the Messaggero reporter Fabrizio Menghini, who had followed the case from the outset. The idea, however, was echoed by almost all local and national newspapers. On 24 May 1953, an article by Marco Cesarini Sforza, published in the communist magazine Vie Nuove, had much resonance: one of the characters appearing in the investigation and allegedly linked to politics, so far known as \\"the blond\\", was identified as Piero Piccioni. Piccioni was a film score composer, the lover of Alida Valli and the son of Attilio Piccioni, Deputy Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and a major exponent of the Christian Democrats. The name of \\"blond\\" had been attributed to the young Piccioni by Paese Sera: an article published on the May 5 told how the young man had brought to the police station the missing garments of the murdered girl. Identification with Piero Piccioni was a fact known to all journalists, but no one had ever revealed the identity to the general public. In early May, Il merlo giallo published a cartoon satire in which a garter belt, held in the beak of a pigeon (\\"Piccione\\" in Italian), was brought to the police station, a clear reference to the politician and crime. The news caused uproar because it was published shortly before the 1953 general election. Piero Piccioni and political scandal Piero Piccioni sued the journalist and the editor of Vie Nuove, Fidia Gambetti for defamation. Sforza was subjected to a harsh interrogation. The Italian Communist Party (PCI), owner of the newspaper and sole \\"political\\" beneficiary of the scandal, refused to recognize the work of the journalist, who was accused of \\"sensationalism\\" and threatened with dismissal. Even under interrogation, Cesarini Sforza never directly quoted the name of the source from which officially the news came, saying only that it came from \\"the faithful environments of De Gasperi.\\" Even the journalist's father, a professor of philosophy at Sapienza University of Rome, suggested to his son to recant, as well as the lawyer Francesco Carnelutti, who had taken the side of plaintiff on behalf of Piccioni. The lawyer of Marco Cesarini Sforza, Giuseppe Sotgiu (former president of the provincial administration of Rome and member of the PCI) made an agreement with his colleague, and on May 31 Cesarini Sforza recanted his statements. He poured 50,000 Lire to charity to \\"House of fraternal friendship for freed from prison,\\" and in exchange Piccioni dropped the charge. Although, for the moment, scandal for the Christian Democrats was excluded, the Piccioni name had been mentioned and later would return to prominence. Meanwhile, during the summer, the case disappeared from the news pages. In film At the end of the 1960 film La dolce vita, fishermen retrieve from the sea a dead ray-like monster.

A major reason for the Bumblebee efforts was the need to attack bombers before they could launch standoff anti-shipping weapons, as these aircraft might never enter the range of the shipboard guns. Bumblebee originally concentrated on a ramjet powered design, and the initial Applied Physics Lab PTV-N-4 Cobra/BTV (Propulsion Test Vehicle/Burner Test Vehicle) was flown in October 1945. Cobra eventually emerged as the RIM-8 Talos, which entered service on 28 May 1958 aboard the light cruiser USS Galveston. As part of the development program, several other vehicles were also developed. One of these developed into the RIM-2 Terrier, which entered operational status on 15 June 1956, two years before Talos; Terrier was first installed aboard the heavy cruiser USS Canberra. The Terrier was later modified as a short-range missile system for smaller ships, entering service in 1963 as the RIM-24 Tartar. Together, the three missiles were known as the \\"3 T's\\". Bumblebee was not the only early Navy SAM project; the SAM-N-2 Lark was rushed into production as a short-range counter to the Kamikaze threat, but never matured into an operational weapon. Origin Navy ships were hit by air-launched Henschel Hs 293 and Ruhrstahl SD 1400 X anti-ship guided bombs during 1943. A ramjet-powered anti-aircraft missile was proposed to destroy aircraft launching such weapons while remaining beyond the range of shipboard artillery. Initial performance goals were target intercept at a horizontal range of 10 miles and altitude, with a warhead for a 30 to 60 percent kill probability. Heavy shipping losses to kamikaze attacks during the Battle of Okinawa provided additional incentive for missile development. Field testing In addition to initial tests at the Island Beach, New Jersey, and Fort Miles, Delaware, temporary sites, Camp Davis, North Carolina, was used for Operation Bumblebee from c. June 1, 1946, to July 28, 1948. Topsail Island, North Carolina, became the permanent Bumblebee testing and launch facility in March 1947. The Topsail Historical Society hosts the Missiles and More Museum at the site. Testing was transferred to Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake and then to White Sands Missile Range in 1951 where was built as a prototype Talos launch facility. Program results The RIM-2 Terrier, devised as a test vehicle, became operational as a fleet anti-aircraft missile aboard USS Boston in 1955, and evolved into the RIM-66 Standard. Talos became operational with the fleet aboard USS Galveston in February, 1959, and saw combat use during the Vietnam War. Ramjet knowledge acquired during the program aided development of the XB-70 Valkyrie and the SR-71 Blackbird. Solid fuel boosters developed to bring the ramjet to operational velocity formed the basis for larger solid fuel rocket motors for ICBMs, satellite launch vehicles and the space shuttle.

Life He was born in Denver, Colorado. When his mother remarried during his youth, he took his stepfather's name to become Gene Fowler. Fowler's career had a false start in taxidermy, which he later claimed gave him a permanent distaste for red meat. After a year at the University of Colorado, he took a job with The Denver Post. His assignments included an interview with the frontiersman and Wild West Show promoter Buffalo Bill Cody. He established his trademark impertinence by questioning Cody about his many love affairs. Subsequently, Fowler worked for the New York Daily Mirror and then became newspaper syndication manager for King Features. His later work included more than a dozen screenplays, mostly written in the 1930s, and a number of books, including biographies and memoirs. During his years in Hollywood, Fowler became close to such celebrities as John Barrymore and W. C. Fields. Fields, whose animus toward children is legendary, claimed that Fowler's sons were the only children he could stand. In 1916, Fowler married Agnes Hubbard, who bore three children, the eldest of whom was Gene Fowler Jr. (1917‚Äì1998), a prominent Hollywood film editor (whose work included It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and Hang 'Em High) and a sometime director (1957's I Was a Teenage Werewolf as well as numerous television programs). Gene Fowler died in Los Angeles, California, aged 70. Anecdotes Fowler was the subject of many colorful anecdotes. One told by his son Will, concerns a scene outside of John Barrymore's hospital room in May 1942. > A stranger entered the waiting room where [John] Decker and Fowler were > sitting with reporters. \\"I am a healer,\\" cried the stranger. \\"Just give me > three minutes with Mr. Barrymore and I will cure him!\\" There was a moment of > silence until Fowler arose, snatched the seemingly demented fellow by the > scruff of his collar and threw him down the stairs, calling after him, > \\"Physician, heal thyself!\\" Fowler was present at Barrymore's death, and he claimed (perhaps not seriously) that Barrymore's last words, spoken to Fowler, were: \\"Is it true that you're the illegitimate son of Buffalo Bill?\\" Books * Trumpet in the Dust.

Peter Corren died of cancer on 30 December 2009. Background The Correns, a same-sex couple with one adopted son, are long-time activists for gay rights who have been involved in several high-profile cases. They were among the first gay couples to foster and adopt children in Canada. In the late 1990s, Murray Warren, a Coquitlam schoolteacher, was one of the petitioners in Chamberlain v. Surrey School District, a case that dealt with the Surrey School Board's refusal to approve as learning resources several children's books featuring same-sex parents.Mark Hume and Janice Tibbetts, \\"Ban on books unreasonable, court rules: 'Public schools must mirror diversity of community': Between the covers\\", National Post 21 December 2002, A08; Paula Brook, \\"War over words: it's a battle over three slim storybooks.

A06; cf. that lifted the ban on same-sex marriage in British Columbia. They were one of the first same-sex couples to marry in Canada. Human rights complaint In 1997, Cook and Warren complained to the BC Human Rights Tribunal that public schools in British Columbia discriminated against gays by failing to include information about them in curricula, and that the lack of such representation amounted to systemic discrimination. The Tribunal accepted their case, but as the hearing approached in 2006, the provincial government negotiated a settlement with the Correns by which the province committed itself to review the inclusivity of school curricula and would introduce a new elective course on social justice that would include sexual orientation, race, ethnicity and gender issues. The agreement stipulated that the Correns would be consulted about the section of the new course on sexual orientation and more broadly about the presentation of gays in the broader school curriculum. It also stipulates that the government must solicit feedback directly from organization or groups, identified by the Correns, \\"with expertise in sexual orientation, homophobia, and other issues of inclusion and diversity in the curriculum\\". Under the agreement, these organizations are allowed guaranteed input into the revision of any curriculum for any grade, which \\"they consider should be given priority in light of sexual orientation issues\\". One controversial feature of the agreement is that the provision of \\"Alternative Delivery\\", which allows parents to opt their children out of parts of the curriculum, will be limited to specific courses.Settlement Agreement, 1A Reactions As in many cases involving the education system and LGBT issues, the potential for conflict between the human rights of LGBT people and the religious freedom rights of parents, both of which are protected under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, has created significant controversy. Both religious media and mainstream newspaper editorials (most notably the National Post) have raised concerns about appointing the activists to revise the curricula. The British Columbia School Act, which governs the public school system in the province, states that public schools \\"must be conducted on entirely secular and non-sectarian grounds\\". While faith-based schools nominally have the freedom to teach according to their own religious beliefs, they are required by law to teach the same curriculum as the public system, and thus would be affected by any substantial curriculum changes resulting from the Corren agreement. To date, the government has not stated whether religious schools will be required to teach a curriculum if it conflicts with religious beliefs. Writing in the British Columbia Catholic, Vancouver Archbishop Raymond Roussin, SM, said of the deal: \\"This would be clearly contrary to the fundamental and non-negotiable right of parents to raise their family and educate their children. The right of parents to determine how their children receive instruction on matters of faith and morals must be the primary consideration\\" (4 September 2006). His comments were condemned the following day by Peter Corren as a \\"homophobic diatribe against Canadian society\\". (CCRL Press Release, 7 September 2006) The Corren Agreement has resulted in the curriculum (IRP) for the agreed course on social justice, Social Justice 12, an elective course, being published. The agreement has also begun to affect the rest of the curriculum, in part through influencing the revision of course curricula as they come up for revision, and in part through a teachers' guide, Making Space. (See links to the various sections in \\"Curriculum Support Materials\\" This guide potentially could influence the teaching of all courses. (See \\"Background and Rationale\\") Board of Education of School District No. 34 (Abbotsford) v. Corren Controversy erupted in 2008 when one school district, Abbotsford, where the conservative school board didn't approve the course. This produced protest from some students and from the Correns and their supporters. The Abbotsford district also tried to force parental consent for students to take the course. In response to this the Correns sued the Abbotsford school board to adapt the course and to drop the parental consent requirement in the Board of Education of School District No. 34 (Abbotsford) v. Corren. While the case was being processed the Abbotsford school board allowed the course in its schools for the 2009/2010 school year so the Correns amended their case to focus on dropping the parental consent.

Demographics India census, Labbaikudikadu had a population of 11,891. Males constitute 50.2% of the population and females 49.8%. Background: A small peaceful town, Labbaikudikadu is famous for its culture and hospitality. It is popularly referred to as LBK or Kudikadu and also known as Mini Dubai. Most parts of the town are noisy from around 7:00 am to 6:00 pm and the streets are very busy especially around the Bus Stand, because of the people coming into the town. Most members of this community flourished in different public and private sectors in Persian Gulf countries, while a few others concentrated on business in their home town. In the early 1980s, majority of the male population had emigrated to various parts of Persian Gulf seeking employment opportunities. A large concentration of these families are based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. With the oil boom and increasing trade in the Persian Gulf, several members held key positions in various government and private sectors. The rising income led to huge savings that were converted as investments into properties. Today, Labbaikudikadu has turned into a dense concrete jungle with big houses and narrow lanes. Political setup: The town is categorically divided into East Section and West Section which is respectively overseen by West Jamaat and East Jamaat. Each of these Jamaats are overseen by Chiefs known as Jamaatars and are usually chosen by the other members of the Jamaat. Religions: Muslims form a majority (about 98%) of the population. The community becomes so alive during the two Eid festivals - Eid-ul-Adha (Bakrid) and Eid-ul-Fitr (Ramzan). There are several large masjids and some of the minarets of the masjids are so prominent that they can be visible from the main national highway (NH 45) which is about 5‚Äì6 km away. There is a communal get-together in the form of 'Aatu Nombu' that is held prior to the Eids. It is a festive moment wherein young men, women and children gather to meet on the dry riverbed at vellar river, to enjoy home-made snacks and enjoy small rides and attractions. In addition to above, there is also a get-together in Dubai at Mushrif park in the name of 'Namadur kudumbam' that has been held on the last Friday of April in every year since 2006. This get-together is kept for Labbaikudikadu people who was working in UAE. There is also a temple for the Hindu members of the community.  Transport  There are several Government and Private Buses connecting the village with Perambalur, Ariyalur and Trichy. Mini Buses link the Village with nearest small villages. Also, frequent buses available to Chennai and other Southern districts of Tamil Nadu from Thozhudhur Toll Plaza which is situated 2;km from the Village. Culture There are two main holidays in Islam: Eid Al-Fitr, Ramadan and Eid Al-Adha. Eid Al-Fitr is celebrated at the end of Ramadan (a month of fasting), and Muslims usually give zakat (charity) on the occasion. Eid Al-Adha is celebrated at the end of Hajj (annual pilgrimage to Mecca), which is one of the five pillars, and Muslims usually sacrifice an animal and distribute its meat among family, friends and the poor. All Islamic holidays follow the lunar calendar, and thus move each year relative to the solar calendar. The Islamic calendar has 12 months and 354 days on a regular year, and 355 days on a leap year.

In February 1564, Peruvian Viceroy Diego L√≥pez de Z√∫√±iga y Velasco died suddenly or was killed. The president of the Audiencia of Lima, Juan de Saavedra briefly served as interim viceroy. Garc√≠a de Castro was sent from Panama to take over the positions of governor, captain general, and president of the Audiencia. He was in effect interim viceroy. He arrived in Lima on September 22, 1564 and served until 1569. The Indians of Peru had an oral tradition referring to Pacific islands known to Hahuachimbi and Ninachumbi. These mythical islands came to the attention of the Spanish in Peru, and even before their discovery were known as the Solomon Islands (named for the biblical king) or the Islands of Gold. Viceroy Garc√≠a de Castro decided to send a naval expedition to the west to investigate whether these islands were real. He wrote to King Philip II that he was sending his nephew, Alvaro de Menda√±a de Neira, with 100 men. The expedition consisted of two ships. It discovered Wake Island and the Solomon Islands. He suspected the Inca of plotting rebellion in Chile and Argentina. After discovering some evidence to support this, he ordered all horses and firearms confiscated from the Indians. In 1567 an expedition under Captain Mart√≠n Ruiz de Gamboa was sent to subdue the island of Chilo√© (Chile). Ruiz met little resistance. He founded the city of Castro there, named for Viceroy Garc√≠a de Castro. On August 21, 1565, King Philip created a royal mint in Lima, at the urging of a previous viceroy, Diego L√≥pez de Z√∫√±iga y Velasco, but it was in existence only briefly. He died at Madrid in 1576.

In all versions of Java, the idiom enables a safe, highly concurrent lazy initialization of static fields with good performance.The double checked locking idiom does not work correctly in Java versions prior to 1.5.\`INSTANCE\` should be package private public class Something { private Something() {} private static class LazyHolder { static final Something INSTANCE = new Something(); } public static Something getInstance() { return LazyHolder.INSTANCE; } } The implementation of the idiom relies on the initialization phase of execution within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as specified by the Java Language Specification (JLS).See 12.4 of Java Language Specification for details. When the class \`Something\` is loaded by the JVM, the class goes through initialization. Since the class does not have any static variables to initialize, the initialization completes trivially. The static class definition \`LazyHolder\` within it is not initialized until the JVM determines that \`LazyHolder\` must be executed. The static class \`LazyHolder\` is only executed when the static method \`getInstance\` is invoked on the class \`Something\`, and the first time this happens the JVM will load and initialize the \`LazyHolder\` class. The initialization of the \`LazyHolder\` class results in static variable \`INSTANCE\` being initialized by executing the (private) constructor for the outer class \`Something\`. Since the class initialization phase is guaranteed by the JLS to be sequential, i.e., non-concurrent, no further synchronization is required in the static \`getInstance\` method during loading and initialization. And since the initialization phase writes the static variable \`INSTANCE\` in a sequential operation, all subsequent concurrent invocations of the \`getInstance\` will return the same correctly initialized \`INSTANCE\` without incurring any additional synchronization overhead.  Caveats  While the implementation is an efficient thread-safe \\"singleton\\" cache without synchronization overhead, and better performing than uncontended synchronization, the idiom can only be used when the construction of \`Something\` is guaranteed to not fail. In most JVM implementations, if construction of \`Something\` fails, subsequent attempts to initialize it from the same class-loader will result in a \`NoClassDefFoundError\` failure.

It is situated 9 km southeast of Sigmaringen. History The area has been inhabited since prehistoric and early historical times. Two late Bronze Age graves were found in Mengen, both including many metal artifacts. It was around the first Century after Christ Birth, when Romans built a castle on the hills in Ennetach. By this, the Romans strengthened their influence along the Danube River, before they were later driven out by the invading Alemanni. These settled in the area and founded many places with the endings \\"-ingen\\", which is thought to be the origins for the city Name of \\"Me-ingen (now Mengen). In 1876 it was found on the site of a former Roman villa rustica so far the only preserved in Upper Swabia color mosaic of the Roman period. It shows in a medallion the head of Medusa (known as \\"Medusa of Mengen\\") and legendary figure remains plait, to which was joined by other original medallions. The remaining parts of the mosaic floor are unfortunatelly not preserved. Since the Second World War they have been lost.

The new Mengen (where it is today), built around 1150‚Äì1250, was created next to the old settlement Mengen (today Ennetach). The old and the new Mengen were separated by the river Ablach, therefore, in order to distinguish between the two places, the old Mengen \\"beyond the river\\" (Ennet Aach) called. On March 4, 1276 Mengen acquires the municipal law, issued in Augsburg by King Rudolf von Habsburg. Mengen was 1276 to 1805 as one of the so-called five Danube cities Vorder√∂sterreich (together with Ehingen, Munderkingen, Riedlingen and Bad Saulgau). In 1806, Mengen fell by Napoleon and the Peace of Pressburg to the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. To 18 May 1632 during the Thirty Years' War Mengen was hard pressed by Swedish troops, but has not been taken. The inhabitants had intensively called the Mother of God, to stand next to them and therefore wrote this also the salvation of the city from the attacking soldiers, which is why the May Day is celebrated annually in Mengen today. [4] In 1774 there were in total 23 Restaurants in Mengen, of which 21 were brewing their beer itself. [5] On October 7, 1819 broke in Mengen from a fire in the old town.

Getty became familiar with Sullivan's work from the architect's various Loop projects as well as from the mausoleum (also in Graceland) Sullivan designed for Getty's late partner, Martin Ryerson. History The Getty Tomb has been said to be the most significant piece of architecture in Graceland cemetery and the beginning of Sullivan's involvement in the architectural style known as the Chicago School. The tomb, which stands on its own triangular plot of land, is composed of limestone masonry construction. Roughly a cube in shape, the bottom half of the tomb is composed of large, smooth limestone blocks. The upper half is composed of a rectangular pattern of octagons, each containing an eight-pointed starburst design. The cornice is banded with smooth limestone above intricate spiraling patterns below, and the top-edge of the roofline is straight and horizontal on the front and back and scalloped in a concave fashion on the sides. Side window When approaching the tomb, the obvious focus is the ornate doorway. An intricately ornamented bronze gate and door, patinated green over time, are spanned by a broad semi-circular archway. The voussoirs, emanating radially in long thin wedges, share alternating plain and intricately carved concentric bands. The twin gates as well as the door behind share a combination of geometric and floral details that incorporate the starburst seen in the upper patterned walls. The three other sides of the tomb house semi-circular, bronze-clad windows that mimick the arch and door details of the front. A plaster cast of the door was exhibited at the 1900 Paris Exhibition where it won Sullivan an award. Henry joined his wife in the tomb shortly after he died in Paris, France, on March 31, 1919 (date per his obituary in the Chicago Daily Tribune, published April 2, 1919). Their only child Alice was added in 1946. On March 10, 1971, the tomb was designated as a Chicago Landmark by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks. :Getty Tomb; from Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) archives See also *Martin Ryerson Tomb *Wainwright Tomb Getty Family Tomb at Graceland Cemetery https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/40440199 References *Lanctot, Barbara.

It is situated at the mouth of the Peribonka River where it forms a bay on the north shore of Lac Saint-Jean. Louis H√©mon (1880-1913), a French writer, spent several months in P√©ribonka in 1912 during which he prepared the notes for his famous novel, Maria Chapdelaine. Peribonka comes from the Innu word periwanga (or possibly from pelipaukau), meaning \\"river digging in/removing the sand\\", from the roots per or pen, \\"to remove\\", and anga, meaning \\"sand\\". History In 1673, Jesuits Fran√ßois de Crespieul and Charles Albanel visited the place. But a village did not form until 1888 when the families of √âdouard Niquet (or Niquette) and √âdouard Milot arrived. Niquet had been sent there by Antoine Labelle, then Deputy Minister of Colonization of Quebec. A significant impetus to colonization came in 1897 with the founding of the Colonization and Repatriation Society of Quebec and Lac Saint-Jean, organization that encouraged the establishment of settlers and the repatriation of French- Canadian families exiled in the United States. The Peribonka Post Office opened in 1898. Am√©d√©e Robitaille established the Peribonka Pulp Company which led to the founding of the municipality of Saint-Am√©d√©e in 1902. The following year, the Parish of Saint-√âdouard-de-Peribonka was formed and named after √âdouard Niquet and the adjacent river, that first got its name back in 1679. In 1909, the Municipality of P√©ribonka was founded by separating a portion of Saint-Am√©d√©e's territory. But in 1926, Saint-Am√©d√©e was completely annexed by P√©ribonka.

It is the fifth of seven novels in the Shadow Children series. Plot summary The fifth book starts off directly where the last book had ended, from the point of view of Trey, Luke's friend from Hendricks' School for Boys. After Luke Garner (Lee Grant) leaves Smits Grant, the younger brother of the real Lee Grant, in the care of his real parents, Luke's friend Trey finds himself at Mr. Talbot's front door preparing to explain all the recent events. The car containing Trey's friends, Nina, Joel, and John takes off without Trey. The house is raided soon afterward and thanks to luck and his own vast knowledge from reading during his years in hiding, Trey manages to dive to safety behind a flowerpot. A member of the Population Police, who searches the porch, says liber (Latin for free). Trey's knowledge of Latin saves his life, as the raider reports that the porch is clear. After the raid, Trey sneaks into the house and encounters a hostile but stunning woman with bright red hair; she is none other than Mrs. Talbot. Together, they discover from a private news network that the government has been overthrown and replaced by the powerful Population Police. Defeated, Mrs. Talbot abandons the house and leaves Trey to fend for himself. After sorting himself out and taking several obscure, important looking documents found within the Talbot house, Trey sets out to find help, hopefully to find Lee and the others. He winds up on the Garner farm and ventures out with Mark, one of Luke's older brothers, to find Luke/Lee and the rest of his friends. They instead find themselves at Population Police Headquarters, once the house of the Grants; Mark is captured and taken instead and Trey must sign up as a recruit to save him. Using his own ingenuity, despite his own fears, Trey manages to save injured Mark by working out a deal with a Population Police guard. He was also able to save his missing friends and Mr. Talbot from execution with the help of a rebel named Nedley. The group find safety at Mr. Hendricks' cottage and discover the schools have been raided and emptied of their students and able-bodied teachers. Then the group is nursed back to health by Mrs. Talbot, who happens to be a doctor. Afterward, Trey presents the documents that he saved, despite several opportunities where he may have abandoned them. Mr. Talbot reveals that the documents conceal the identities of hundreds of Third Children with false identities and they decide to burn them to protect the children. But Trey wants to take the names and the responsibility. Trey snatches them away at the last moment, resolving to take small steps to destroy the Population Police from within along with Lee, Nina, the chauffeur, and Nedley.

It was discovered on 20 April 1950, by astronomer Robert Curry Cameron of Indiana University during the Indiana Asteroid Program at Goethe Link Observatory in Indiana, United States. It was named after Winifred Cameron, an astronomer at the United States Naval Observatory.  Orbit and classification  The stony S-type asteroid is a member of the Phocaea family (), a group of asteroids with similar orbital characteristics, named after the family's namesake 25 Phocaea. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9‚Äì2.8 AU once every 3 years and 8 months (1,336 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.18 and an inclination of 25¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. Winifred was first identified as at Johannesburg Observatory in 1928, extending the body's observation arc by 22 years prior to its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics   Rotational lightcurve  In July 2009, a rotational lightcurve was obtained for this asteroid from photometric observations taken by American astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado. It gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with an exceptionally high brightness amplitude of in magnitude (), and no sign of a non-principal axis rotation (NPAR). The result supersedes a previous observation by French astronomer Laurent Bernasconi from May 2005, that gave a similar, yet less accurate period of 129 hours, and with a smaller amplitude of 0.51 in magnitude ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Winifred has an albedo of 0.24 to 0.25 and a diameter between 9.3 and 10.7 kilometers, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives a higher albedo of 0.31 and a diameter of 9.5 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12.0.

It had excellent land for farming, among the finest in the Lac Saint-Jean region at the time. Circa 1891, a mission was established in the township, served by pastors from Saint-M√©thode and Normandin. In 1892, the Albanel post office opened. In 1899, the township was incorporated as the Township Municipality of Albanel. The presence of adequate hydraulic power, in particular the Chute aux Fran√ßais on the Mistassini River, and several dairies had contributed to modest, but significant, economic growth of the village of Albanel. In 1930, it separated from the township and formed the Village Municipality of Albanel.

It was discovered on 14 March 1950, by IU's Indiana Asteroid Program at Goethe Link Observatory near Brooklyn, Indiana, in the United States. It was later named after the U.S. state of Indiana and for Indiana University.  Classification and orbit  Indiana is a member of the Flora family, a large collisional group of stony S-type asteroids in the inner main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.0‚Äì2.5 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,229 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 4¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. Indiana was first identified as at Turku Observatory in Finland, extending the body's observation arc by 7 years prior to its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics   Rotation period  Three rotational lightcurves of Indiana were obtained from photometric observations taken by astronomer Michael Pietschnig, Gary Vander Haagen and Michael Fleenor in Spring 2007. The lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period between 2.57 and 2.61 hours with a change in brightness of 0.12 to 0.19 magnitude, respectively ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and NASA's Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Indiana measures between 7.97 and 8.52 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo between 0.250 and 0.297. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24 ‚Äì derived from 8 Flora, the largest member and namesake of this family ‚Äì and calculates a diameter of 8.62 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12.49.  Naming  This minor planet was named for the U.S. state of Indiana and for Indiana University with its astronomy department, which is the parent institution of the discovering Goethe Link Observatory. Originally the discovery was credited to Beryl H. Potter (1900‚Äì1985), after whom the asteroid 1729 Beryl is named. She was research assistant at the Indiana University, who participated in the program of minor planet observations from 1949 to 1966. During this period, she analysed nearly 6,300 photographic plates, measuring the positions of minor planets and reporting lost asteroids to IAU's Minor Planet Circulars (MPCs) for publication. However, according to Frank K. Edmondson (1912‚Äì2008), chairman of the Astronomy Department of Indiana University (also see 1761 Edmondson), there were several assistants involved in blinking the photographic plates during the first years of the program. The discovery was therefore credited to Indiana University, instead. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center in January 1955 ().

It was discovered on 28 January 1950, by IU's Indiana Asteroid Program at Goethe Link Observatory near Brooklyn, Indiana, United States. It is named for American astronomer Conrad Bardwell.  Orbit and classification  Bardwell is a member of the Themis family, a dynamical family of outer-belt asteroids with nearly coplanar ecliptical orbits. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.6‚Äì3.7 AU once every 5 years and 6 months (2,020 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.18 and an inclination of 2¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.18 and an inclination of 2¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. It was first identified as at Simeiz Observatory in 1926, extending the body's observation arc by 24 years prior to its official discovery observation.  Naming  This minor planet was named for Conrad M. Bardwell (1926‚Äì2010), who was a research associate at the Cincinnati Observatory and later associate director of the Minor Planet Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. Bardwell successfully established numerous identifications from observations in widely separated oppositions and provided observers with reliable data of orbital elements. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 15 June 1974 ().  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen taxonomy, Bardwell is a blueish B-type asteroid, a rare subtype of the abundant carbonaceous C-types found in the outer belt. The spectra of B-type bodies show a broad absorption feature at one micron wavelength that is associated with the presence of magnetite and is what gives the asteroid its blue tint. There are only a few dozens asteroids of this type known to exist.  Rotation period  In the late 1970s, a rotational lightcurve of Bardwell was obtained by American astronomer Edward Tedesco. It gave a provisional rotation period of 18 hours with a change in brightness of 0.2 magnitude (). As of 2017, no other photometric analysis of Bardwell has been made.  Diameter and albedo  According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Bardwell measures between 21.92 and 31.58 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo between 0.049 and 0.09. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link agrees with the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.0642 and a diameter of 27.78 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.38.

Buffy fights her way through the Mission, opening the door to the chapel where she is transported to the Sunken Church. There she encounters three nasty looking demons and the Master who she is shocked to see as she killed him and crushed his bones to dust. The Master cheerfully greets her and then drains her. Moments later, Buffy wakes from the nightmare safe in her bed. The next night, Buffy practices for cheerleading as a favor to Cordelia when vampires invade the school. Buffy orders Cordelia to take the other girls into the supply closet while she turns the lights back on. Buffy battles through the school, fighting vampires and Symbiotes before finding the janitor, Creepy Pete, dead. She gets his keys and heads to the basement where she restores power to the school. At that point, Giles contacts her to tell her that he is under attack and she rushes to the library where she fights off a powerful vampire named Malik who escapes with a book on spirit channeling. Giles is unable to determine why Malik wanted the book but isn't worried so Buffy and her friends leave for a night at the Bronze. At the same time, Malik is revealed to be working for Spike who has returned to Sunnydale and regrouped the Order of Aurelias. Spike uses the book to summon the spirit of an ancient being named Lybach who possesses Drusilla to force Spike to do its bidding. Lybach orders Spike to get fresh human sacrifices for a coming ceremony and he dispatches vampires to the Bronze then he encounters Buffy. At the Bronze, Buffy and the others party until the vampires, led by one named Scylla, break in and kidnap several students, including Willow. Buffy chases the vampires outside where she encounters and fights off Spike. Buffy continues to follow the vampires in hopes of rescuing her friends and eventually ends up in the cemetery where she encounters the powerful necromancer Materiani who summons zombies to aid in delaying her. Buffy fights through waves of vampires, zombies and hellhounds to a mausoleum where she finds Scylla and Willow. Buffy fights Scylla who, like Malik, proves more powerful than an ordinary vampire. Buffy beats Scylla who flees rather than continue the fight, leaving Willow behind. Realizing that Spike has taken over the Sunken Church and still has more victims, Buffy decides to go after them after consulting with her friends. The group can't come to any conclusion besides that Spike may be trying to draw an ancient evil forth into this world and Buffy sets off again on her own. Buffy reenters the mausoleum where she fights through zombies to reach the secret passageway leading to the Sunken Church. In the passage she fights more zombies and demonic spiders before finally reaching the Church. Buffy battles her way through the Church, now faced with demons as well as spiders and zombies and finally reaches the altar where the ritual is taking place. She arrives too late to save the victims, but interrupts the ritual causing the vampires to run while Materiani stays to fight her. Buffy kills Materiani and takes his Tedarka Talisman, but not before he completes the ritual. To Buffy's shock, the Master is resurrected as a phantom and she flees as the area collapses. Giles explains that while the Master couldn't be resurrected in physical form, a skilled necromancer could bring him back as a phantom though he has no idea why it would be done. Buffy mentions her dream and the appearance of the Master and gives Giles the sigil the demons from the dream wore in hopes that it is a clue. Xander decides to see what information he can get from Willy the Snitch while Buffy heads to Angel's Mansion in hopes he can figure out the Master and Spike's plans. At the Mansion, Angel tells Buffy only she can save him before being abducted by demons. Buffy fights through the Mansion to try to save him, fighting vampires and demons. Finally, Buffy reaches Angel's training room where she encounters Scylla once more. However, this time, Scylla transforms into a giant snake monster and attacks. Buffy defeats Scylla and kills her by exposing her to sunlight. Angel arrives, but is possessed by the Master, forcing Buffy to flee. As Buffy talks with her friends, she learns that Xander found out that the vampires are expecting a shipment of some sort at the docks and that Giles learned that the sigil represents three demons known as the Dreamers who have great mental powers and can bend reality while together. Buffy decides to kill the Dreamers and takes off with her friends for the docks to intercept the vampires shipment. At the docks, Buffy finds herself facing an ever-increasing number of vampires, demons and demonic spiders in her way to the ship where the shipment is located. Some of these enemies block her way with forcefields. After a determined battle, Buffy reaches a warehouse where the cargo has been unloaded to find that it is one of the Dreamers. Buffy kills the Dreamer, infuriating the Master who needs it for his and Lybach's plan. The Master comes up with another plan, to use a mixture of steel and blood to forge a Deglon Sphere that will amplify the remaining Dreamers powers and allow the plan to work. He sends his men to take control of a local foundry and Malik and Spike to stop Buffy. However, he enrages Spike by threatening Drusilla. Buffy learns from Willow that she has discovered how to exorcise the Master from Angel but they have to find him first. As Buffy heads out to find someone to lead her to the Master, demons and vampires attack the high school again, injuring Cordelia. Buffy battles through the school, learning along the way that there is a bomb in the basement. Buffy disarms the bomb and faces Malik once more who transforms into sabertoothed animal. Buffy defeats and stakes Malik, but fails to kill him, something she fails to realize. As Malik attacks again, Spike suddenly kills him and saves Buffy. Spike offers an alliance to stop the Master and save Angel and Buffy reluctantly accepts. Spike explains to Buffy and her friends that an Old One named Lybach has a plan to build a bridge from his demon dimension to Earth in order to lead an army of demons to take over the world. He needed the Dreamers to warp reality to create the bridge and the Master's expertise in dimensional portals to make it work. Spike is only helping as Lybach is possessing Drusilla and threatens to destroy her mind if he doesn't. However, Spike doesn't like the plan and has had enough. He offers to lead the group to the Master and help save Angel in exchange for their help in saving Drusilla. The group reluctantly agrees and sets out for the foundry. At the foundry, Buffy battles her way in to the Master while her friends and Spike work on locating and rescuing Drusilla. Buffy fights through a determined vampire and demon resistance before finally reaching the Master. Buffy and the Master fight it out and Buffy defeats the Master but can't kill him without harming Angel. As the Master taunts her, Buffy reveals she hasn't come alone and Willow exorcises the Master as Xander and Giles exorcise Lybach from Drusilla. The Master attempts to possess Spike but Willow's spell protects him and the Master flees angrily. However, Angel reveals that it is not over as the Order got the Deglon Sphere and the Master intends to continue the plan even without Lybach's guidance. Having gotten what he wants, Spike and Drusilla leave and Buffy and her friends make preparations to assault the Sunken Church to stop the Master once and for all. Giles determines to Buffy's dismay that he and the others must perform a spell to give the Master back physical form so Buffy can destroy him again as he is too powerful to be destroyed by an exorcism and Willow gives her the Tedarka Talisman to guide her through any warped realities the Dreamers may come up with. Buffy battles through electrical tunnels and eventually reaches the Sunken Church. Buffy has to battle through an army of vampires and demons before she finally reaches the Master and the Dreamers. However, rather than fight, the Master casts Buffy into the Dreamers' realm where she has to find her way through levels of a giant maze. Buffy manages to make it through the maze with the help of the Tedarka Talisman. Finally, Buffy finds the Dreamers at the end of the maze and kills them, returning her to the Sunken Church and destroying the Deglon Sphere. With the Master and Lybach's plan thwarted, Buffy faces off against the Master himself as her friends' spell takes effect. Finally, Buffy impales the Master on a giant stake and kills him once more. She and the others flee the Sunken Church as it collapses. Later that night, the group celebrates at the Bronze before Buffy must take off after a vampire, her work never done. Development This project started as a PlayStation game, but development was moved to the Dreamcast and Windows. These versions were later scrapped, and development was moved to the Xbox. The game was re- released as part of the Xbox Classics series. While Buffy the Vampire Slayer was advertised as a single-player game, it has a hidden multiplayer mode, apparently for debugging purposes. The game starts with a variation of the expository narrative that was featured in the early Buffy episodes, as well as a variation on the opening titles sequence. However, both of these are made up of game footage. Reception The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Ryan MacDonald, writing for GameSpot, said that it \\"is a terrific action game that has a great mix of multiple gameplay types and a great story.\\" The Cincinnati Enquirer gave it a score of four stars out of five and stated that \\"Video games based on TV franchises don't always live up to the shows that inspired them. Fortunately, Buffy the Vampire Slayer is an exception.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave it a B and said that \\"as vampire videogames go, Slayer doesn't suck.\\" Maxim gave it seven out of ten and called it \\"eye-popping\\".

The lingam is really huge and the vibration in the temple is soul stirring. the sthala varaluru states Kumbera's sons came down to earth and they constructed the temple here after the vilva (leaves of vilva tree) they offered to Lord turned into Gold. The temple is quite old and cannot be visited easily as it is quite remote and not popularly known. Unfortunately this ancient and beautiful temple is in ruins and badly needs funding for restoration. All the good work is carried out by the Koil gurukkal who worshipped the lord from age 9, after taking the baton from his father, who was the earlier gurukkal. The Gurukkal, with funding made by good samaritans is doing an astounding job to do three times pooja to the Lord and keep the temple activities going. however the temple still needs Kumbabhishekam done as the last kumbabhishekam was performed 50 years ago.

One day she set them to spin while sitting on the edge of a well, giving her daughter good flax and her stepdaughter coarse, unusable flax, and declared that whoever's thread broke first would be thrown in. When her stepdaughter's thread broke, she threw her in. The girl fell to a wonderful land. She walked on and came to a tumble-down fence, overgrown with vines. It pleaded with her not to hurt it, because it did not have long to live, and she carefully jumped over it where the vines were less. She found an oven full of loaves, and it told her she could eat what she liked, but begged her not to hurt it. She ate a loaf, thanked it for such fine bread, and shut its door. She came to a cow with a bucket on its horns; it said she could milk it and drink, but asked her not to hurt it or spill its milk. She agreed, and when a drop of milk was left, the cow told her to throw it over its hooves and hang the bucket back up. She came to a house. An old woman asked her to comb her hair. When she did, the old woman showed her a farm where she could take service. She took good care of the cows, gave milk to the cats, and when she sieved corn, gave some to the birds. One day, her mistress summoned her and told her to fill a sieve full of water and bring it back. The birds told her to use ashes to stop up the holes. Another day, she had to wash some black yarn until it became white, and white yarn until it became black. The birds told her to face east to turn the black white, and west to turn the white black. Then her mistress had her weave them into a robe as smooth as a king's by sunset, but the skeins tangled and broke every moment. The cats wove it on her behalf. She wanted to leave and go home. Her mistress sent her to an attic and told her to take whatever casket she liked. She considered many beautiful ones, but the cats directed her to a black one, so she took it and went home. Her stepmother took her wages, but the box was filled with marvelous treasures. Her stepmother put her own daughter on the edge of the well, to spin with coarse stuff, and threw her down the well when it broke. The daughter proceeded as her sister had, but was rude to everyone on the wall, and worked very poorly at the farm, including the three tasks her stepsister had done. At the end of the year, she went on her way with a large red casket. When she opened it at home, fire burst out and burned her and her mother to death.

It was discovered by the Indiana Asteroid Program at Goethe Link Observatory near Brooklyn, Indiana, on 8 October 1953. The asteroid was named after American astronomer Henry Norris Russell.  Orbit and classification  Russell is a member of the Koronis family (), a very large outer asteroid family with nearly co-planar ecliptical orbits. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.7‚Äì3.1 AU once every 4 years and 11 months (1,781 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.08 and an inclination of 2¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first identified as at Lowell Observatory in June 1947. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery at Goethe Link Observatory in February 1950, more than 3 years prior to its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  Russell is an assumed stony S-type asteroid, which agrees with the overall spectral type of the Koronis family.  Rotation period  In April 2014, a rotational lightcurve of Russell was obtained from photometric observations at the Sonoita Research Observatory () and Etscorn Campus Observatory (). Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 12.797 hours with a brightness variation of 0.46 magnitude ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Russell measures between 16.576 and 17.033 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.118 and 0.201. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24 and calculates a diameter of 15.61 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.2.  Naming  This minor planet was named after distinguished American astronomer Henry Norris Russell (1877‚Äì1957), noted for the H‚ÄìR diagram and research on a variety of topics in fundamental astronomy, astrophysics, and the analysis of atomic spectra (see Russell‚ÄìSaunders coupling).

NU.nl is part of the Finnish media group Sanoma Media, which aside from several printed publications and websites also owns Dutch web portal Startpagina.nl. On December 10th DPG Media announced that it had acquired Sanoma Digital Netherlands, with the exclusion of the firms educational activities. The sale is pending approval from the Dutch anti monopoly watch dog.  History  The site was founded in 1999 and back then was the first Dutch news website that published news 24 hours a day. Kees Zegers, Sacha Prins, Merien ten Houten and Robert Klep were the site's founders and Joost Boermans and Charlotte van Berne were its first editors. The site was a joint venture of Ilse Media Groep b.v. and Virtual Industries Online Marketing Solutions b.v. In 2001 Nu.nl changed hands to Sanoma, when Ilse Media Groep was bought by VNU. In 2002 Rogier Swagerman became editor-in- chief. Together with Wiggers (publisher) he started collecting pictures from readers. These pictures were offered to news agencies. In 2002 NU.nl made a mobile version of its site available for use. In 2006 Swagerman was replaced by Laurens Verhagen (up to then editor at ). In 2007 the website got several subpages or extensions. NUsport for sports news and NUzakelijk for financial and business news. The site started collecting readers' commentaries. On NUjij people could comment on news stories and upload their own. On NUfoto (amateur) photographers could send in photographs of recent events. In 2008 a map was added (NUkaart) and later more expansions followed, of which NU&toen; and NUlive were the most important. NU&toen; is a continually expanding historical image library where events from the past are recalled via old photographs. NUlive was made to filter news from the big number of Dutch tweets that are published daily. In 2009 a German version of NU.nl was launched (dnews.de), based on the Dutch site. This site was cancelled in 2011 however, because of disappointing visitor numbers. The site published a free printed newspaper to commemorate its 10th anniversary. In 2011 NU.nl's appearance was altered. The alterations were made to make NU.nl more readable on bigger monitors and to stay with the times. The most important NU websites (NUzakelijk, NUsport et cetera) are since then displayed on the top of the website. On November 18, 2011, editor-in-chief Laurens Verhagen suddenly left NU.nl due to an internal disagreement, and was succeeded on May 11, 2012, by Wouter Bax, who came from the Dutch newspaper Trouw. On June 25, 2013, it became public that Bax would be leaving NU.nl. He was succeeded on July 1, 2013, by Gert-Jaap Hoekman, who until that point had been deputy editor-in-chief.

It was discovered on 13 October 1953, by astronomers of the Indiana Asteroid Program at Goethe Link Observatory in Indiana, United States. The asteroid was named after Kenneth P. Williams, professor of mathematics at Indiana University.  Orbit and classification  Based on its osculating Keplerian orbital elements, Williams qualifies as a member of the Flora family (), a giant asteroid family and the largest family of stony asteroids in the main- belt (according to Zappal√† but not Nesvor√Ω). However, analysis using proper orbital elements in a hierarchical clustering method showed that Williams is a background asteroid, not belonging to any known family (Nesvor√Ω, Milani and Kne≈æeviƒá). The asteroid orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.7‚Äì2.6 AU once every 3 years and 3 months (1,183 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 4¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first identified as at Nice Observatory in March 1939. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation in October 1953.  Physical characteristics  Williams is an assumed S-type asteroid.  Rotation period  In October 2008, a rotational lightcurve of Williams was obtained from photometric observations by Petr Pravec at Ond≈ôejov Observatory in the Czech Republic. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of at least 36 hours with a brightness amplitude of more than 0.30 magnitude (). Another observation by Pierre Antonini gave a period of 8 hours ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Williams measures 6.38 and 6.982 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.32 and 0.3305, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24 ‚Äì derived from 8 Flora, the Flora family's largest member and namesake ‚Äì and calculates a diameter of 7.47 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.8.  Naming  This minor planet was named in honor of Kenneth P. Williams (1887‚Äì1958), long-time professor of mathematics at Indiana University. He was known for his textbook, the calculation of the orbits of asteroids and comets, and his detailed analysis of the transits of Mercury from 1723 to 1927. He also wrote Lincoln Finds a General, a five volume book about the American Civil War. The name was proposed by Frank K. Edmondson, who initiated the Indiana Asteroid Program.

He was played by actor Ron Tomme from 1959 to the show's demise in 1980. Van's soulmate Bruce was the second husband of heroine Vanessa Dale. He was a teacher at Winfield Academy, a private boys' school in the fictional upstate New York community of Rosehill. Bruce met Van through a mutual friend of theirs named Tom Craythorne, a New York City lawyer, who had befriended Van after she helped him foil a paternity suit that her malevolent sister, Meg, foisted on him. They had fallen in love and married. A widower with two children, Bruce felt that Vanessa would be a needed mother figure to them. Alan, his son, took to Van almost immediately; as did Bruce's former father in-law, Henry Carlson. But Henry's wife, Vivian and Bruce's headstrong daughter, Barbara, didn't like the new situation. Vivian thought it heartless that Bruce marry so soon after the death of his first wife, Gaye (Henry and Vivian's daughter). However, the war against Vanessa was mostly on the front of snobby Vivian. Bruce had his share of trials, especially with Barbara. She and a date went joyriding and almost injured Dr. Tony Vento, a handsome doctor (who was the son of a cleaning woman, Mrs. Vento) that she wanted to marry. Barbara told Van all about it, and then Van, out of concern, told Bruce about it. Barbara was annoyed with Van and hated her steadily since. Barbara did marry Dr. Vento, but he found her completely immature. Not surprisingly, he divorced her. Henry offered Bruce a job at his paper company, and accepted it, feeling burned out from teaching at Winfield Academy. There was the beginning of marital problems for the Sterlings. Bruce had an affair with his secretary, a woman named Ginny Crandall (Barbara Barrie), who had been the wife of a teacher at Winfield Academy, and that caused Van to move out of the house and in with her stepson in his apartment. He also saved a girl named Sandy Porter from a rapist named Glenn Hamilton (Bert Convy). He also had an affair with Dr. Jennifer Stark (Jennifer Bassey). A swindler named Guy Latimer tried to bilk Henry out a patent, and Bruce put an end to that scheme. However, he wasn't through with the Latimers. Guy's maverick son, Rick, had married Barbara, against everyone's best interests. The two produced a son, Hank Latimer, named after his great-grandfather, Henry (Barbara's grandfather). Rick, however, found her to be a very immature girl, and divorced her, taking Hank with him. Barbara then left Rosehill, never to return. Bruce has worn many hats in Rosehill over the years. Besides his teaching career at Winfield Academy and his job at the Carlson Paper Company, he was also a professor at Rosehill University; the editor of the Rosehill newspaper; and also mayor of the city of Rosehill. He was also a private investigator, but despite all his work and the amount of service to his community over the years, not to mention his affairs, his one true love was his wife, Vanessa. Presumably, the Sterlings still live in Rosehill and have retired happily. Trivia Ron Tomme originated the role of Bruce. He wooed Vanessa (played by Bonnie Bartlett at that time), right up to the wedding day. When Van actually walked down the aisle, the next day, she was played by Audrey Peters, who stayed with the role until the show's end in 1980. Since Audrey had taken over right after Bonnie Bartlett quit the show, and had no idea who the characters she was interacting with were, or even knew their names, she called everyone at the reception, \\"dear\\".

History  Battle of Lalsot  Rajputs and Marathas fought a pitched battle in May 1787 called the Battle of Lalsot. Such was the state of things when the ascendancy of Mahadji Scindia received a signal from the combined forces of Marwar and Jaipur and the of Lalsot in which the Maratha chief was defeated. It was the signal for the Rajputs to resume their alienated territory. Nor was the Rana of Mewar backward on the occasion when there a momentary gleam of the active virtue of past days. Maldas Mehta was civil minister of Mewar with Mauji Ram as his deputy, both men of talent and energy. They first effected the reduction of Nimbahera and the smaller garrisons of Marathas in its vicinity who from a sense of common danger assembled their detachments in Jawad which was also invested. Sivaji Nana the governor capitulated and was allowed to march out with his 442 effects. At the same time the sons of the Kal Megh of Thikana Begun-Mewar assembling drove the Marathas from Begun, Singoli etc. and the districts on the plateau while the Choondawats redeemed their ancient fief of Rampura and thus for a while the whole territory was recovered. Elated by success the united chiefs advanced to Chardu on the banks of the Rarkia a streamlet dividing Mewar from Malwa preparatory to further operations. Had these been confined to the maintenance of the places they had taken and which had been withheld in violation of treaties complete success might have crowned their efforts but in including Nimbahera in their capture they drew upon them the energetic Ahilya Bai, the regent queen of the Holkar State, who unluckily for them was at hand and who coalesced with Sindhia's partisans.

The body's observation arc begins with its identification as at Heidelberg Observatory in December 1917, almost 40 years prior to its official discovery observation at Goethe Link.  Physical characteristics  Wrubel is a dark, carbonaceous asteroid. In the Tholen classification, its spectral type is ambiguous. Based on a numerical color analysis, it is closest to the dark D-type asteroid with some resemblance to the X-type asteroids (which encompass the primitive P-types).  Rotation period  In July 2012, a rotational lightcurve of Wrubel was obtained from photometric observations. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 5.260 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.33 magnitude ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Wrubel measures between 37.704 and 42.20 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.113 and 0.1360. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopt the results obtained by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.1061 and a diameter of 42.33 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 9.92.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Marshal Henry Wrubel (1924‚Äì1968), professor of astronomy and faculty member at Indiana University, who was co- founder of the Indiana University Research Computing Center pioneering the use of high speed computers for astrophysical computations. The name was proposed by Frank K. Edmondson, who initiated the Indiana Asteroid Program. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 20 February 1971 ().

It was discovered on 7 September 1962, by astronomers of the Indiana Asteroid Program at Goethe Link Observatory in Indiana, United States. The asteroid was named after American astronomers Vesto Slipher and his brother Earl C. Slipher.  Classification and orbit  Slipher is member of the mid-sized Padua family (), an asteroid family named after 363 Padua and at least 25 million years old. It consists of mostly X-type asteroids, that were previously associated to 110 Lydia (the Padua family is therefore also known as Lydia family). Slipher orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.5‚Äì3.0 AU once every 4 years and 7 months (1,665 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 5¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its first identification as at the discovering Goethe Link observatory in October 1953, or 9 years prior to its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  In the SMASS classification, Slipher is a carbonaceous C-type asteroid. PanSTARRS photometric survey characterized the asteroid as an X-type asteroid, which is in line with the overall spectral type of the Padua family.  Rotation period  In 2012, two rotational lightcurves of Slipher were obtained from photometric observations by astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 7.677 and 7.693 hours with a brightness variation of 0.20 and 0.19 magnitude in the S- and R-band, respectively ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Slipher measures between 14.37 and 20.29 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.044 and 0.11. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 20.21 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.2.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the brothers Vesto Slipher (1876‚Äì1969) and Earl C. Slipher (1883‚Äì1964), both graduates of Indiana University. Vesto Slipher was a pioneer investigator of the spectra of the planets, and was the first to measure the redshifts of galaxies, which was instrumental for Hubble's discovery of the expanding Universe. Earl Slipher developed and improved the direct photography of the planets. His photographs are the only continuous and systematic record of the appearance of the planets for a period of more than half a century.

It only achieved commercial success in the Netherlands, where rock critics also voted it album of the year. Like all of his post-Byrds records, it did very poorly on the US charts. In June 2018, independent reissue label Intervention Records released White Light on vinyl and as a hybrid CD/SACD. Background Clark's backing band on the album included producer and guitarist Jesse Ed Davis, bassist Chris Ethridge of the Flying Burrito Brothers, organist Michael Utley, along with pianist Ben Sidran and drummer Gary Mallaber, both of the Steve Miller Band. Although Clark began another album for A&M;, the label stopped the sessions before that album was completed. Those tracks were available in the Netherlands on Clark's 1973 album Roadmaster, which was not released in the United States until 1994. Reception Music critic Thom Jurek, writing for AllMusic, wrote the album \\"has established itself as one of the greatest singer/songwriter albums ever made... Using melodies mutated out of country, and revealing that he was the original poet and architect of the Byrds' sound on White Light, Clark created a wide open set of tracks that are at once full of space, a rugged gentility, and are harrowingly intimate in places. His reading of Bob Dylan's \\"Tears of Rage\\", towards the end of the record rivals, if not eclipses, the Band's. Less wrecked and ravaged, Clark's song is more a bewildered tome of resignation to a present and future in the abyss. Now this is classic rock.\\" Track listing Personnel ;Musicians *Gene Clark ‚Äì vocals, acoustic guitar, harmonica *Jesse Ed Davis ‚Äì electric guitar, bottleneck guitar *John Selk ‚Äì acoustic guitar *Chris Ethridge ‚Äì bass *Gary Mallaber ‚Äì drums *Mike Utley ‚Äì organ *Ben Sidran ‚Äì piano *Bobbye Hall ‚Äì congas, percussion ;Production *Jesse Ed Davis ‚Äì producer, mixing *Joe Zagarino ‚Äì engineer *Baker Bigsby ‚Äì assistant engineer References 1971 albums Gene Clark albums A&M; Records albums Albums recorded at A&M; Studios ","title":"White Light (Gene Clark album)"},{"id":"5799563","title":"Always (Atlantic Starr song)"},{"id":"5799566","text":"Lamjaotongba is a census town in Imphal West district in the Indian state of Manipur.

It was discovered on 25 July 1950, by astronomers at Indiana University during the Indiana Asteroid Program at Goethe Link Observatory in Indiana, United States. The K-type asteroid has a rotation period of 6.3 hours. It was named for Russian conductor Serge Koussevitzky.  Orbit and classification  According to several HCM-analyses by Zappal√†, Moth√©-Diniz, as well as Milani and Kne≈æeviƒá, Koussevitzky is a core member the Eos family (), the largest asteroid family of the outer main belt consisting of nearly 10,000 asteroids. However, in a more recent HCM-analysis by Nesvorn√Ω, Koussevitzky is a non- family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.7‚Äì3.4 AU once every 5 years and 3 months (1,923 days; semi-major axis of 3.03 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.12 and an inclination of 11¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed as at Simeiz Observatory in August 1929. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Goethe Link in July 1950.  Naming  This minor planet was named in memory of Russian-born Serge Koussevitzky (1874‚Äì1951), long-time music director and conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The asteroid's name was proposed by astronomer Frank K. Edmondson of Indiana University on the occasion of Serge Koussevitzky's centenary of the birth on 26 July 1974. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 January 1974 ().  Physical characteristics  In the SMASS classification, Koussevitzky is a stony K-type asteroid, typical for members of the Eos family. The asteroid has also been characterized as an L-type by Pan-STARRS.  Rotation period  In June 2013, a rotational lightcurve of Koussevitzky was obtained from photometric observations by Brian Warner at the Palmer Divide Station in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.40 magnitude (). Alternative period determinations of 6.325, 6.328 and 6.329 hours were made by astronomers at the University of Iowa using its Rigel Telescope at the Iowa Robotic Observatory in Arizona, by French amateur astronomer Ren√© Roy, and by staff members of the Palomar Transient Factory in California, respectively ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer, Koussevitzky measures between 17.88 and 23.26 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.1426 and 0.241. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.1506 and a diameter of 18.82 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.3.

Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.14 and an inclination of 14¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. It was first identified as at Johannesburg Observatory in 1936. The body's observation arc begins at Goethe, five days after its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics   Lightcurve  In March 2005, a rotational lightcurve of Hesburgh was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Brian Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado. Lightcurve analysis gave a longer-than average rotation period of 47.7 hours with a brightness variation of at least 0.18 magnitude ().  Spectral type  In the Tholen taxonomy, Hesburgh is a rare CD: spectral type, an intermediary between the common carbonaceous C-type asteroid and the dark D-type asteroid, which is typical among the Jupiter trojans beyond the main-belt. Another asteroid with a CD:-type is 691 Lehigh.  Diameter and albedo  According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Hesburgh measures between 32.39 and 41.27 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.078 and 0.1041. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.1041 and a diameter of 35.55 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 10.32.  Naming  This minor planet was named after American Theodore M. Hesburgh (1917‚Äì2015), a priest and president of the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana. He was also a member of the National Science Board and played a decisive role for the founding of the Kitt Peak National Observatory, as well as of the Chilean Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory during the 1960s.

It was discovered on 16 September 1952, by astronomers of the Indiana Asteroid Program at Goethe Link Observatory in Indiana, United States.  Orbit and classification  Asaph orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.1‚Äì3.7 AU once every 4 years and 11 months (1,781 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.28 and an inclination of 22¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation Goethe Link.  Physical characterization  In November 2001, a rotational lightcurve of Asaph was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Brian Warner. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 4.74 hours with a low brightness variation of 0.06 magnitude (). Upon re- examination of the revised data set, Warner constructed a new, ambiguous lightcurve with two possible period solutions of and hours (). These observations supersede a period of 9.19 hours derived from two fragmentary lightcurves obtained in 2001 and 2006, respectively ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Asaph measures between 19.678 and 21.29 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.09 and 0.1045. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and consequently calculates a larger diameter of 25.44 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.7.

The film stars Utako Mitsuya and Shigeru Amachi, and is notable for separating itself from other Japanese horror films of the era such as Kwaidan or Onibaba due to its graphic imagery of torment in Hell. It has gained a cult film status. Shintoho declared bankruptcy in 1961, its last production being Jigoku. Plot A young Tokyo theology student, Shir≈ç (Shigeru Amachi), is set to marry his girlfriend, Yukiko (Utako Mitsuya), the daughter of his professor, Mr. Yajima. After announcing the engagement, Shir≈ç's dark and unsettling colleague, Tamura (Y≈çichi Numata), drives Shir≈ç home, suggesting that Shir≈ç had been sleeping with Yukiko for some time. Taking a side street at Shir≈ç's request, Tamura hits and kills drunken yakuza gang leader, Ky≈çichi. Though Shir≈ç wants to stop, Tamura keeps driving, stating that it does not concern him and that ultimately, the murder is Shir≈ç's fault for asking him to drive down the street. Unbeknown to either of them, Ky≈çichi's mother (Kiyoko Tsuji) witnessed everything and resolves to find and kill them. Though Tamura feels no guilt for the murder, Shir≈ç does and attempts to go to the police. After telling Yukiko of what happened, Shir≈ç insists that they take a taxi cab to the police station, despite Yukiko's pleas to walk instead. While in the cab, Shir≈ç hallucinates that Tamura is driving the cab, and it crashes, killing Yukiko. After her funeral, Shir≈ç seeks solace in the arms of strip bar worker and Ky≈çichi's grieving girlfriend Yoko (Akiko Ono), who discovers Shir≈ç's culpability for the hit-and-run after sleeping with him and, with Ky≈çichi's mother, plots revenge. Shir≈ç receives a telegram that his mother, Ito, who lives in a country-side retirement community run by his father, G≈çz≈ç, is dying and rushes to see her. There, he meets the other residents including a disgraced painter, Ensai, who is painting a portrait of Hell, a former reporter, Akagawa, a corrupt detective, Hariya, and the community doctor, Dr. Kasuma. He meets Sachiko (also played by Mitsuya), a nurse and Ensai's daughter, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Yukiko, and is taking care of his mother. During his stay, Shir≈ç and Sachiko become close while each of the residents' sordid activities is revealed: While Shir≈ç's mother lies dying, his father carries on an open affair and also cheats the community of its money by cutting corners; the painter is wanted for a crime in another city; the detective threatens to turn the painter in unless he gives him Sachiko to marry; and the doctor knows his diagnoses are wrong, but feels that seeking a second opinion is too cumbersome. Both Mr. and Mrs. Yajima, both despondent after Yukiko's death, arrive by train to pay their respects to Shir≈ç's mother. Ito dies, and Ensai blames G≈çz≈ç; decades ago, he and Ito were lovers before G≈çz≈ç came between them and married her leaving her unhappy. Inexplicably, Tamura appears and reveals that each of the residents has some complicity in a murder: Mr. Yajima killed his comrade during the war, stealing his water for himself; both the detective and reporter framed or slandered innocent men who then both committed suicide; and the doctor knew his diagnosis of Ito's condition was wrong, but chose not to tell anyone. Yoko tracks Shir≈ç down and meets with him on a rope bridge in the area. There she reveals her identity and attempts to shoot him while Ky≈çichi's mother watches from the trees, but she trips and falls to her death. Tamura appears, and the two struggle over the gun, and Tamura also falls into the gorge. Shir≈ç stumbles back in time for the community's tenth anniversary party, where G≈çz≈ç has knowingly allowed cheap, rancid fish to be served to the residents. As the party descends into debauchery, Mr. and Mrs. Yajima both decide to leap in front of the train, killing themselves, and G≈çz≈ç's mistress falls to her death following an altercation. The residents die from consuming the tainted fish, and Ky≈çichi's mother sneaks into the party, poisoning the remaining residents' wine, killing them. Tamura, near death, stumbles into the party and shoots Sachiko, while Ky≈çichi's mother strangles Shir≈ç to death and then commits suicide. In Limbo, Shir≈ç encounters Yukiko, who reveals that she was pregnant with his child, a baby girl named \\"Harumi\\", but has sent her floating away on the river of the underworld and begs Shir≈ç to save her. Shir≈ç enters Hell and is sentenced to punishment in the Eight Realms of Hell by Lord Enma for his sins. While running through Hell to find his daughter, he encounters each of his acquaintances, who suffer, in gruesome fashion, a variety of punishments for their sins, such as being boiled and burned alive, dismembered and flayed, or cut apart and beaten by ogres, only to be revived to suffer anew. Meanwhile, Tamura taunts Shir≈ç, saying there is no escape from Hell, before being butchered for giving his soul over to evil. In a realm filled with glass shards jutting from the ground, Shir≈ç finds Sachiko, but their reunion is interrupted by Shir≈ç's mother, who shamefully reveals that Sachiko is his sister: Shir≈ç is actually Ensai's son, and Sachiko is actually her daughter, also a product of her later affair with Ensai. Shir≈ç is disgusted with his family, and continues searching for his daughter, determined to live and save her. While caught in a vortex of damned souls, he finds his baby daughter helplessly rotating on the Buddhist wheel of life. Lord Enma gives Shir≈ç one chance to save his daughter, otherwise she too will suffer for all eternity in Hell. As Yukiko, Sachiko, and his mother call to him, Shir≈ç leaps onto the wheel, but cannot reach his daughter. The moment is frozen in time, revealed to be nine o'clock: the exact time that everyone at the party has finally died, including Ensai, who has hanged himself after completing his portrait of Hell and set it on fire. In a final scene, both Sachiko and Yukiko stand smiling in peaceful light, calling to Shir≈ç as sister and lover, respectively, with lotus petals falling around them, symbolizing mental and moral purity.

Production Nobuo Nakagawa asked Ichir≈ç Miyagawa to write the script, which was originally supposed to be called Heaven and Hell, under order of producer Mitsugu Okura. Mitsugu Okura read the script and angrily said to Miyagawa that \\"Heaven is nowhere to be seen in this script!\\", to which Miyagawa jokingly replied that he would write about Heaven in the sequel. Actor Yoichi Numata played Tamura in the film, and expressed that he had tried to analyze the role, but couldn't find the best way to play it. The film was not expected to be well received, as Shintoho studio was considered to be a maker of low-budget, gory films. Jigoku was made in a hurry, and was the last Shintoho production. For the scenes which take place in hell, the cast and crew used Shintoho's largest soundstage and put dirt over it. In a recent documentary, a crew member said that normally it would be just the crew helping to build the sets, but because it was Shintoho's last production, all the extras were helping. Mamoru Morita said that Nobuo Nakagawa tried in many ways to make Jigoku different from other horror films from the time. Release Jigoku was theatrically released in Japan on July 30, 1960. Home media The film was released on DVD in North America from the Criterion Collection on September 19, 2006. Reception Later reception Later reviews of the film have been more positive, with many critics now recognizing it as a cornerstone for Nakagawa‚Äôs career. Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews awarded the film a grade \\"A\\", calling it \\"[a] disquieting morality tale based upon the Buddhist concept of an afterlife\\". Schwartz praised the film's performances, and visuals which he felt 'acted as a lurid study of sin without salvation'. In an essay for the Criterion Collection, Chuck Stephens wrote, \\"Overflowing with brackish ponds of bubbling pus, brain-rattling disjunctions of sound and image, and at times almost dauntingly incomprehensible plot twists and eye-assaulting bouts of brutish montage, Jigoku is more than merely a boundary-pummeling classic of the horror genre‚Äîit‚Äôs as lurid a study of sin without salvation as the silver screen has ever seen.\\" Brett Gallman from Oh, the Horror! praised the film, calling it \\"a masterpiece in visual and abstract horror\\". Gallman praised the film's performances, eerie score, Nakagawa‚Äôs direction, and \\"vivid color palette\\". HorrorNews.net stated in their review of the film that, \\"Although this film contains effects that are outdated by modern standards, it is a very powerful story that is based upon the Buddhist belief that sins are atoned for in the afterlife.\\" The film has developed a cult following over the years and is now considered a cult classic. Legacy In 1979, the acclaimed Nikkatsu Roman Porno director Tatsumi Kumashiro remade Jigoku for Toei.

They started painting graffiti in 1987 and their work appears on streets and in galleries across the world. Style Their work has been described as \\"escapist fantasies,\\" notable for its dreamy, illustrative, and patterned style. Observers have compared this dream-like aesthetic to the works of Hieronymus Bosch and M. C. Escher. Their work often features yellow-skinned characters‚Äîtaken from the yellow tinge both of the twins have in their dreams‚Äîbut is otherwise diverse and ranges from tags to complicated murals. Subjects range from family portraits to commentary on S√£o Paulo's social and political circumstances, as well as Brazilian folklore. Their graffiti was influenced by both traditional hip hop and Brazilian culture. Influences The twins started out as breakdancers and got involved with graffiti later on. Their first graffiti emulated early New York City hip hop pieces. It was some years before they began to put Brazilian cultural elements and influences into their graffiti. Their first significant artistic influence outside their immediate environment, and their limited access to American hip hop (Style Wars, Subway Art, Beat Street), stemmed from a chance encounter with Barry McGee (also known as Twist), who was in Brazil for several months on a study abroad program through the San Francisco Art Institute in 1993. Technique and experience were shared, and McGee provided photographs of American graffiti. Through McGee, OSGEMEOS met Allen Benedikt (founder of 12oz Prophet Magazine and also part Brazilian), who together with Caleb Neelon (also known as Sonik) was the first to interview them after a trip to Brazil in 1997 (in 12oz Prophet Magazine Issue 6; 1998), which became OSGEMEOS' introduction to audiences outside of South America.  Notable public works  A figure by OSGEMEOS, part of Tate Modern's Street Art exhibition, is removed at the end of the exhibition.  Brazil  There have been many works by OSGEMEOS made in Brazil. As of the early 2000s a couple of graffiti artists, OSGEMEOS included, were invited to paint trains legally. This raised OSGEMEOS' profile, helping them transition to large-scale public commissioned work, such as murals (for example the Paulista Avenue mural). In 2009, they painted a mural in Vale de Anhangabau, S√£o Paulo, commissioned by the SESC Brazil. Titled \\"The Foreigner,\\" the piece was originally scheduled to be shown for thirty days, but public approval allowed it to remain until the demolition of the building in 2012. For the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, the duo were commissioned to decorate the national soccer team's official Boeing 737 aeroplane. The project used over 1,200 cans of spray paint to depict the diversity of Brazilian culture.  Asia  In 2008, OSGEMEOS painted several works in Mumbai, India; many of were still visible in 2016. More recently, OSGEMEOS exhibitied at Art Basel in Hong Kong through the Lehmann Maupin gallery. Lisbon, Portugal  Europe  OSGEMEOS painted a 16 m by 10 m mural in the centre of Heerlen, the Netherlands. This painting was part of the cultural festival Cultura Nova. It was the inspiration for the large opening act where the head character came to life in association with the French group La Plasticiens Volant. The show \\"L'Etranger\\" premiered on 29 August 2008 and was one-off seen at Cultura Nova. The wall painting continues to be preserved and is shown on the Schelmenhofje in Heerlen, the Netherlands. In 2008 OSGEMEOS painted six large-scale murals on Tate Modern in London, for the three month duration of the exhibition. Lisbon, Portugal also features many works by OSGEMEOS. In 2010 and 2011, OSGEMEOS painted two large-scale murals on the sides of buildings. The project was planned by a public private commission and is considered representative of the Portuguese-Brazilian cultural relationship. Other cities in Europe which feature the work of OSGEMEOS include Vilnius, Lithuania; Milan, Italy; Minsk, Belarus; and Berlin, Germany.  North America  Their first solo exhibition in the United States was at The Luggage Store in San Francisco, California in 2003. As part of the Dreamland Artist Club 2005 project, they painted a 130-foot mural in Coney Island on Stillwell Ave.Creativetime.org In 2009, OSGEMEOS painted their first mural in Manhattan on the northwest corner of Houston Street and the Bowery. The colorful, fantastic, and imaginative composition was compared to a work of magical realism. One of their works is a wall in Miami, Florida painted for Art Basel Miami Beach. Other cities include Boston and Los Angeles. In 2012, OSGEMEOS painted a 70-foot by 70-foot public mural in Dewey Square in Boston, Massachusetts, which received public backlash. The piece, created in collaboration with the ICA and Rose F. Kennedy Greenway Conservancy, depicted a young, yellow figure with its face wrapped in a red shirt. On a segment for Fox 25 News, commentators linked the image to racially charged, post-9/11 fears of terrorism. Meanwhile, The Boston Globe considered it to be a successful public artwork. As the original commission was only temporary, the work was removed on schedule in 2013. In 2014, OSGEMEOS created their largest piece to date, titled \\"Giants,\\" for the Vancouver Biennale in Vancouver, Canada on six industrial silos. Large and expensive, the work is notable in that it was paid for through crowdfunding.  Fine art  OSGEMEOS have exhibited fine art pieces across the world, including paintings, sculptures, installations, drawings, and performance pieces. In 2013, they collaborated with luxury brand Louis Vuitton to design a scarf, alongside artist Retna and Lady Aiko. In 2016, an Untitled 2009 piece from OSGEMEOS sold for over $300,000 at market. In Chelsea New York, a portrait of the twins was commissioned by a NYC street art program the New Allen. Painted by Jorit Agoch, the work can be found on Allen Street in Chelsea, NYC.

The documentary opens with some quick framing of the task, including footage of the ramp and the car to be used for the jump, and then chronicles how Carter became a daredevil, including footage of some early jumps. It then follows the ups and downs he experienced in his five-year journey to jump the river. He has a series of financial and technical obstacles. Technical problems include difficulties with the car (the fuel tank keeps blowing up) and the ramp he was planning to jump off (it was bumpy and not necessarily structurally sound). The financial problems are simpler; he kept running out of money and his backers were unhappy. In the fifth year, everything was ready, but two attempts were called off ‚Äî one because of a short strike by the ground crew, and one because of weather. The backers, desperate to finish, believed that Carter had lost his nerve and called him to a meeting in another city, and then brought in another driver, Kenny Powers, to attempt the jump. The bumps in the ramp had not been fixed, and as the car accelerated, it started to shake itself to pieces and fell apart in midair. The parachutes deployed and the car landed in shallow water. Powers survived with eight broken vertebrae (he later recovered fully). The effort to make the jump was abandoned. The film closes with Carter vowing to continue trying. However, a few years after the movie was made, the ramp was demolished, and then Carter was killed in 1983 in Peterborough, Ontario, while attempting another stunt. The ramp and its runway were located in a field just west of Hanes Road, south of county road 2 in Morrisburg, Ontario, Canada. The ramp has since been demolished, but the concrete runway still exists as of 2020. The title song was performed by the blues performer Long John Baldry. Produced by the National Film Board of Canada, The Devil at Your Heels won the Genie Award for Best Theatrical Documentary. On 16 October 1993, The Devil at Your Heels was screened on Australian television as part of a special hosted by the cast of the ABC comedy series The Late Show. The film was subsequently released on VHS in Australia under the title The Late Show Presents The Devil at Your Heels, with the introductory and closing Late Show material bookending the documentary. A 2016 musical docudrama by John Bolton, Aim for the Roses, documents an album created by Mark Haney that was inspired by Ken Carter. It includes scenes from The Devil at Your Heels, and also shows footage from events after the St. Lawrence jump including Carter's fatal crash at Peterborough.IMDB: Aim for the Roses (May 2016) References External links  Watch The Devil at Your Heels at NFB.ca * Rotten Tomatoes - The Devil At Your Heels 1981 films 1981 documentary films Canadian films Canadian documentary films Biographical documentary films Films about stunt performers Best Documentary Film Genie and Canadian Screen Award winners National Film Board of Canada documentaries Rocket cars ","title":"The Devil at Your Heels"},{"id":"5799750","text":"Lilong Chajing (Imphal West) is a town and a municipality in Imphal West district in the Indian state of Manipur.

There are many Temples, hills and forts (Quila). The festivals of Muharram and Maha Shivaratri are important here. Mudgal in Lingasugur taluk has a very ancient fort. It has often been mentioned in the autobiography of Philip Meadows Taylor. Lingasugur, then known as Chavani was the site of a major British cantonment in the region. History The town of Lingasugur grew from the Kasbah during the colonial era. Early medieval inscriptions have been discovered from nearby Yardona and Karadkal dating from Rashtrakuta period.The place then was known as Kardikalnadu, headquarter of region with 300 villages under its control. During the late 12th century, the headquarter was shifted to Mudgal and hence this place lost its eminence, only to be revived in the 19th century. A cantonment site was built 2 mile north of the Kasbah by the British. The region was under the dominion of Nizam of Hyderabad until 1948. Lingasugur was made a district for about 25 years in the late 19th century. The present day Koppal district, Sindhanur, Shorapur, and Shahapur taluks came under its jurisdiction.

Throughout his life, he was a notable Southern white supporter of African-American civil rights. In addition to his activism, Campbell was also a noted author, particularly with his autobiographical work Brother to a Dragonfly, a finalist for the National Book Award in 1978. Personal and career Campbell was born in Amite County, Mississippi, in 1924, the son of a farmer and his wife. He credited his family with having raised him to be culturally tolerant, even though his family church had Bibles emblazoned with a Ku Klux Klan symbol.https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/will-d-campbell- preacher-and-civil-rights-activist-dies- at-88/2013/06/08/70b67d0a-cee4-11e2-9f1a-1a7cdee20287_story_1.html He was ordained as a minister at age 17 by his local Baptist congregation. He attended Louisiana College, then enlisted in the Army during World War II. He served as a medic. After the war, he attended Wake Forest College (BA, English), Tulane University, and Yale Divinity School (B.D., 1952). Though he held a pastorate in Louisiana from 1952 to 1954, Campbell spent most of his career in other settings. In 1954, he took a position as director of religious life at the University of Mississippi, only to resign it in 1956. This was in part because of the hostility (including death threats) which he received for supporting racial integration. He subsequently took a position as a field officer for the National Council of Churches, and started a period of close engagement with the Civil Rights Movement. In 1963, Campbell left the NCC to become director of the Committee of Southern Churchmen, which was his base for continuing activism.Biographical sketch at University of Southern Mississippi library \\"By the Fire\\" (interview with W. Dale Brown), In Of Fiction and Faith: Twelve American Writers Talk About Their Vision and Work, ed. W. Dale Brown. Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans, 1997. This organization published a journal, Katallagete, referring to the New Testament Greek language for the Pauline phrase \\"be reconciled\\", a reference to 2 Corinthians 5:20. The journal featured articles about politics and social change, as understood through the lens of the Christian faith. It expressed ideas of the neo-orthodox movement, which Campbell had become acquainted with at Yale. Edited by James Y. Holloway of Kentucky's Berea College, Katallagete was published from 1965 until the early 1990s. The CSC relinquished control of the journal to Campbell and Holloway in 1983. By 2005, Campbell described the CSC as \\"nothing ... a name and a tax exemption and whatever I and a few other people were doing on a given day.\\"Joseph Sweat, \\"Nothing Sacred\\", Nashville Scene, December 1, 2005 He continued his work as an individual among his network of acquaintances, including singers Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson, comedian Dick Gregory, cartoonist and playwright Jules Feiffer and writer Studs Terkel.https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/us/will-d-campbell-maverick- minister-and-civil-rights-stalwart-dies-at-88.html?_r=0 Although remaining a Baptist, Campbell reportedly conducted house church worship services in his home late into his life. His home was in Mt. Juliet, Tennessee, outside Nashville. Campbell died on June 3, 2013, in Nashville, from complications of a stroke he suffered in May 2011. He was 88 and was survived by his wife of 67 years, Brenda Fisher, a son, Webb, and two daughters, Bonnie and Penny. Activism Civil rights In 1957, while working for the National Council of Churches, Campbell participated in two notable events of the Civil Rights Movement; he was one of four people who escorted the black students who integrated the Little Rock, Arkansas, public schools; and he was the only white person present at the founding of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference by Martin Luther King Jr. Some black delegates opposed admitting him, but Bayard Rustin sponsored him.https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/will-d-campbell-preacher-and- civil-rights-activist-dies- at-88/2013/06/08/70b67d0a-cee4-11e2-9f1a-1a7cdee20287_story.html In 1961, he helped \\"Freedom Riders\\" of the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to integrate interstate bus travel, despite white mob violence, in Alabama. In a 1964 interview with Robert Penn Warren for the book Who Speaks for the Negro?, Campbell discussed many of the issues of the Civil Rights Movement, including the assassination of Medgar Evers by Byron De La Beckwith, desegregation busing, and the relationship between theology and social activism. He appealed to Southern Christian churches to end their own segregation and fight discrimination, rather than remain silent. Campbell eventually left organized religion, though he remained firmly Christian. Campbell later said, \\"I never considered myself ... an activist in the civil rights movement, though a lot of other people considered me an activist.\\" Will D. Campbell oral history (1976) His uncompromising theology led him to keep his distance from political movements. He insisted that \\"anyone who is not as concerned with the immortal soul of the dispossessor as he is with the suffering of the dispossessed is being something less than Christian\\" Campbell, Brother to a Dragonfly, p. 201 and that \\"Mr. Jesus died for the bigots as well\\".Frye Galliard, \\"The Scandalous Gospel of Will Campbell\\". In Race, Rock, and Religion: Profiles from a Southern Journalist. Charlotte: East Woods Press, 1982, p. 46 These convictions sometimes caused friction between Campbell and other civil rights figures. Campbell was known to minister to members of the Ku Klux Klan and visited James Earl Ray in prison. He remarked in 1976, \\"It's been a long time since I got a hate letter from the right. Now they come from the left.\\" In his book The Stem of Jesse, Campbell examined the experience of Sam Oni, the first black student to attend Mercer University in Macon, Georgia, as well as the moral courage of Joseph Hendricks, who shepherded Mercer through the process of desegregation. He also profiles Samaria Mitcham Bailey, a young American female of African descent, and her resolve in coping with the racial challenges she faced while matriculating at Mercer University. Other issues Campbell also took an interest in other political issues. He participated in protests against the Vietnam War and helped draft resisters to find sanctuary in Canada.ELVIS PRESLEY AS REDNECK by Will Campbell In the late 1970s, he spoke out against the death penalty, particularly after forming a relationship with John Spenkelink, whom the state of Florida executed in 1979.Galliard, \\"The Scandalous Gospel of Will Campbell\\" Campbell also expressed an opposition to abortion. Similarly to William Stringfellow and Jacques Ellul (who were both contributors to Katallagete), Campbell expressed a fairly strong distrust of government and a belief that people must make their own history. These last two stands sharply distinguish Campbell's thought from that of most religious liberal activists. He is considered aligned with more recent postliberal theologians, who denounce the liberal (as well as conservative) esteem for civic society as a misplaced faith, an idolatry taking the place of God and Jesus Christ in the Christian life. Campbell was photographed by Henry Groskinsky from TIME magazine on the balcony at the Lorraine Motel, standing in front of the room where Martin Luther King Jr. Groskinsky said the night was quiet but \\"creepy\\", and he was surprised they were allowed access to this site.

These S.H.I.E.L.D. agents wear armor, and use hardware, designed by Tony Stark and Stark Enterprise employee, Kenny and are trained to take down superhuman combatants. During the events of the Civil War, where these agents were sent to bring in rogue superheroes, its members (and the armored suits themselves) became known as Cape-Killers (sometimes written Capekiller). History A \\"Beetle\\" squad member guns down Tom Lennox The Mighty World Of Marvel #9 (Feb, 1984). Art by Alan Davis The first appearance of an armored superhuman restraint unit in the Marvel Universe was in the pages of Marvel UK's The Mighty World Of Marvel, during the events of the Jaspers' Warp story arc. In this tale, insane reality warper, Jim Jaspers became the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and turned the UK into a fascist state. As PM, he enforced \\"Super Hero Legislation\\"; using armored agents of S.T.R.I.K.E., the UK division of S.H.I.E.L.D., to hunt down and detain superhumans within the UK. These anti-superhuman agents were called \\"Beetle\\" squadrons, due to their beetle head shaped helmets, and were best known for gunning down Tom Lennox, Betsy Braddock's lover. During the events of Marvel Comics' Civil War crossover, the United States government passed a Superhuman Registration Act and used a division of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, recently trained to deal specifically with superhuman threats, to enforce the law. These foot soldiers of S.H.I.E.L.D., known as (Anti-)Superhuman Restraint Unit, and more commonly Cape-Killers, were spread out across Marvel comics, and came into conflict with various superpowered individuals throughout the event and into the subsequent Initiative story arc. Following the Secret Invasion storyline, Norman Osborn is placed in control of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s replacement, H.A.M.M.E.R., and discontinues Stark's line of Cape-Killer technology.Dark Avengers #1 Cape-Killer armor *Armor Not much has been revealed in the comics about the Stark Enterprise's armor which is used by the Cape-Killers. During appearances of this unit, two different styles of helmet have been used; a Riotsquad style helmet and, more commonly, a helmet with a Filter style gas mask. These suits are out-fitted with internal comm systems, and hover discs that give the wearers the ability of flight which have been seen in various comics. *Weapons The Cape-Killer's various firearms in early comics shot tranquilizer darts though later they have been shown to use genetic paralyzer laser weapons. *Weaknesses The armor suits have been shown to be susceptible to power surges in several issues, and Nick Fury, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s former director who went into hiding after the events of the Secret War limited series, would later develop a device that transmitted an electromagnetic overload pulse-broadcast straight into their comm systems, shutting down their suits and frying their electrical systems that was shown to take down several unit members at once.

The van der Waals surface as given by the atomic radii is shown in red. The accessible surface is drawn with dashed lines and is created by tracing the center of the probe sphere (in blue) as it rolls along the van der Waals surface. Note that the probe radius depicted here is of smaller scale than the typical 1.4√Ö. The accessible surface area (ASA) or solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) is the surface area of a biomolecule that is accessible to a solvent. Measurement of ASA is usually described in units of square √Öngstroms (a standard unit of measurement in molecular biology). ASA was first described by Lee & Richards in 1971 and is sometimes called the Lee-Richards molecular surface. ASA is typically calculated using the 'rolling ball' algorithm developed by Shrake & Rupley in 1973. This algorithm uses a sphere (of solvent) of a particular radius to 'probe' the surface of the molecule.  Methods of calculating ASA  Shrake‚ÄìRupley algorithm The Shrake‚ÄìRupley algorithm is a numerical method that draws a mesh of points equidistant from each atom of the molecule and uses the number of these points that are solvent accessible to determine the surface area. The points are drawn at a water molecule's estimated radius beyond the van der Waals radius, which is effectively similar to ‚Äòrolling a ball‚Äô along the surface. All points are checked against the surface of neighboring atoms to determine whether they are buried or accessible. The number of points accessible is multiplied by the portion of surface area each point represents to calculate the ASA. The choice of the 'probe radius' does have an effect on the observed surface area, as using a smaller probe radius detects more surface details and therefore reports a larger surface. A typical value is 1.4√Ö, which approximates the radius of a water molecule. Another factor that affects the results is the definition of the VDW radii of the atoms in the molecule under study. For example, the molecule may often lack hydrogen atoms which are implicit in the structure. The hydrogen atoms may be implicitly included in the atomic radii of the 'heavy' atoms, with a measure called the 'group radii'. In addition, the number of points created on the van der Waals surface of each atom determines another aspect of discretization, where more points provide an increased level of detail.  LCPO method The LCPO method uses a linear approximation of the two-body problem for a quicker analytical calculation of ASA. The approximations used in LCPO result in an error in the range of 1-3 √Ö¬≤.  Power Diagram method Recently a method was presented that calculates ASA fast and analytically using a power diagram. Applications Accessible surface area is often used when calculating the transfer free energy required to move a biomolecule from aqueous solvent to a non-polar solvent such as a lipid environment. The LCPO method is also used when calculating implicit solvent effects in the molecular dynamics software package AMBER. It is recently suggested that (predicted) accessible surface area can be used to improve prediction of protein secondary structure. Relation to solvent-excluded surface The ASA is closely related to the concept of the solvent-excluded surface (also known as the molecular surface or Connolly surface), which is imagined as a cavity in bulk solvent (effectively the inverse of the solvent-accessible surface). It is also calculated in practice via a rolling-ball algorithm developed by Frederic Richards and implemented three-dimensionally by Michael Connolly in 1983 and Tim Richmond in 1984. Connolly spent several more years perfecting the method.

It opened on 30th April 1996 and was built during 1995-96 by Custom Coasters International, who wanted a ride to showcase their company in Europe. Megafobia features a twister style layout. Megafobia was the first white-knuckle attraction to be installed at Oakwood Theme Park (then Oakwood Leisure Park) in West Wales and transformed the park's fortunes from a small family leisure park to a major UK theme park. Until the construction of Wicker Man commenced at Alton Towers in 2017, it was also the most recent wooden roller coaster to be built in the UK. On 30 April 2016 it celebrated 20 Years at Oakwood. Ride experience Out of the station, trains make a left turn and small dip before climbing the 85 foot tall lift hill. At the top, the track makes a 180 degree left turn, before diving down the first drop. The first drop passes through the structure, and is followed by a sweeping left curve and an airtime hill crossing over the lift hill. After this airtime hill, the track hits a 180 degree left turn, to face back towards the lift hill. The camera is situated at the exit of this turn. The track heads back towards the lift hill, passing over an airtime hill and drop that cross under the lift hill and over the first drop. The track then makes a three-quarter right turn that passes through the lift hill's structure. Leaving the lift hill structure, the train passes through an airtime hill and crosses over the exit from the first turnaround before turning around on a 180 degree right turn and drop. The track weaves under itself and traces back along the earlier pass through the lift hill structure before making a drop and turn to the right. After passing under the second hill, the track makes another right turn and then makes another drop before hitting the final brake run. Trains then pass through the transfer track and storage area before returning to the station. Similar rides Rampage at Alabama Adventure, also built by Custom Coasters International, has an almost identical layout to Megafobia. The biggest deviation is the station and brake run. Rampage places the final brake run under the first airtime hill, with trains then making a slight left, passing through the transfer track parallel to the second hill, then going through a dip drop and 180 degree right turn before sliding down another drop into the station. There is thus a slight right turn from the station to the lift hill instead of a left turn.  Awards  Megafobia has consistently been rated among the top wooden coasters in the Golden Ticket Awards.

It is native to South Atlantic islands and islands of the subantarctic southern Indian Ocean, islands and islets off New Zealand and south-eastern Australian islands. Taxonomy and Systematics The German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin described the common diving petrel in 1789. The genus name, Pelecanoides, means \\"Pelican-resembling\\", which was assigned to the diving-petrels on account of their expandable throat pouches that they use to carry food. Its specific name, urinatrix, is derived from the Latin term, urinator, which means \\"diver\\". Its subspecies' names include chathamensis, referring to the Chatham Islands, exsul, meaning \\"isolated\\" or \\"remote\\", dacunhae, referring to the Tristan da Cunha Islands, berard, honoring French navigator Auguste B√©rard, and coppingeri, which honors Royal Navy surgeon and naturalist Richard William Coppinger. There are six subspecies (also listed above), which vary in body measurements, particularly bill size: *P. u. urinatrix (J. F. Gmelin, 1789): Australia, Tasmania and North Island, New Zealand. *P. u. chathamensis (Murphy & Harper, 1916): Stewart, Snares, and Chatham Islands of New Zealand. *P. u. exsul (Salvin, 1896): South Georgia, Subantarctic islands of the Indian Ocean such as the Kerguelen, Heard and McDonald islands, etc., and subantarctic islands of New Zealand, including the Auckland Islands, Antipodes Island, and Campbell Island. *P. u. dacunhae (Nicoll, 1906): Tristan da Cunha archipelago and Gough Island. *P. u. berard (Gaimard, 1823): Falkland Islands, also distributed throughout the Southwest Atlantic. *P. u. coppingeri (Mathews, 1912): Distribution uncertain, possibly breeds in Southern Chile. Description Adult specimen in flight. The common diving-petrel is a small, plump petrel, in length and weighing around . The plumage is black above and dull white below and it has a relatively short black bill. The wings have thin white strips. The face and neck can be more brown than black. The legs and feet are blue with blackish-brown webbing in between the toes. Unless seen very close, it is almost indistinguishable from the South Georgian diving petrel, P. georgicus. The common diving-petrel has brown inner web primary feathers, whereas the South Georgia petrel has light inner web feathering. Common petrels have smaller and narrower bills than the South Georgia petrel. Another difference is that the South Georgia diving petrel has a posterior black line down the tarsi. The common species is also slightly larger than the South Georgian species. Distribution and Habitat Bird flying above the ocean. The common diving petrel is found between latitudes 35 and 55 degrees south, mostly around islands. While the population is decreasing, it is not believed to be rapid enough to be of concern. While burrows are usually dug in vegetated slopes, though they are occasionally built in flatland. Behaviour Pelecanoides urinatrix egg. Bird resting on the ocean's surface.The common diving petrel feeds on the continental shelf during the breeding season, its movements during the non-breeding season are poorly known and whether it disperses more widely is not known. Like other members of their family they catch prey by wing-propelled diving, and are capable of diving to . The diet of this species is dominated by crustaceans. They are known to forage at night on vertically migrating plankton. Feeding is mostly done in the ocean near the shore, but sometimes in the deeper pelagic zone during non- breeding season, which is only 2 months of the year. The mating habits are not well documented, although pairs form monogamous relationships. Breeding colonies are large and there is about one nest per . The nest is a burrow around 50 cm long with a chamber at the bottom which may or may not be lined with dried grass. Females lay a single white egg, which measures 38 x 29 mm, and is incubated for 53‚Äì55 days. The young are brooded for 10‚Äì15 days and fledgling occurs at 45‚Äì59 days. Both parents take care of the young, which are grey-grown when hatched. The life expectancy is 6.5 years.

It is a treatment option in temporal lobe epilepsy for those in whom anticonvulsant medications do not control epileptic seizures. The techniques for removing temporal lobe tissue vary from resection of large amounts of tissue, including lateral temporal cortex along with medial structures, to more restricted anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) to more restricted removal of only the medial structures (selective amygdalohippocampectomy, SAH). Nearly all reports of seizure outcome following these procedures indicate that the best outcome group includes patients with MRI evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis (hippocampal atrophy with increased T-2 signal.) The range of seizure-free outcomes for these patients is reported to be between 80 and 90%, which is typically reported as a sub-set of data within a larger surgical series. Open surgical procedures such as ATL have inherent risks including damage to the brain (either directly or indirectly by injury to important blood vessels), bleeding (which can require re-operation), blood loss (which can require transfusion), and infection. Furthermore, open procedures require several days of care in the hospital including at least one night in an intensive care unit. Although such treatment can be costly, multiple studies have demonstrated that ATL in patients who have failed at least two anticonvulsant drug trials (thereby meeting the criteria for medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy) has lower mortality, lower morbidity and lower long-term cost in comparison with continued medical therapy without surgical intervention. The strongest evidence supporting ATL over continued medical therapy for medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy is a prospective, randomized trial of ATL compared to best medical therapy (anticonvulsants), which convincingly demonstrated that the seizure-free rate after surgery was ~ 60% as compared to only 8% for the medicine only group. Furthermore, there was no mortality in the surgery group, while there was seizure-related mortality in the medical therapy group. Therefore, ATL is considered the standard of care for patients with medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.

WMIC covers the complete Thumb area of Michigan, unlike any other area station. Also, WMIC can be heard from both sides of Lake Huron, Standish and Oscoda to the west, and London, Ontario to the east. On clear weather days, the station can be heard as far away as Roscommon, Ann Arbor, and Lansing.WMIC Coverage WMIC has two co-owned FM sister stations, Light and Easy Listening 97.7 WTGV-FM and Country 92.5 WBGV; the stations are locally owned and operated by Sanilac Broadcasting. WMIC carries 1,000 watts operating during the day only. The station signs off between sunset and sunrise to protect WFAN New York, a 50,000 watt clear channel radio station. In the late evenings and early mornings, they interfere with each other. History WMIC was first granted a construction permit to operate at 1560 kHz on May 10, 1965, and at a thousand watts maximum power. The station was authorized to operate only from sunrise to sunset, protecting WQXR. Transmitter facilities were constructed along Cooper Road near M-19, about a mile and a half south of Sandusky. Shortly before sign-on, the station set up studios at 19 South Elk Street in downtown Sandusky . The call letters were assigned that October. Unforeseen delays resulted in extensions being granted, pushing its actual sign-on date to 1968. Prior to sign-on, the station was granted pre-sunrise authority of 500 watts, which allowed it to sign on two hours before local sunrise, keeping its sign-on time consistent to 6:00am daily. In 1969, George Benko, a Croswell resident, bought into Sanilac Broadcasting Company. He and his family still control the station today. In 1971, WMIC-FM signed on the air, giving Sandusky radio listeners local service after sunset, but this would change six years later, when both entities would separate programming and WMIC-FM would become WTGV. In 1987, WMIC moved to the stronger dial position of 660 kHz, but retained its same power values and daytime-only status. Programming * WMIC features a news and talk format weekdays, including:  Rush Limbaugh weekday afternoons from 2 to 5 pm, and a heavy commitment to local news and information.Shows & Programming * A country classics show is aired weekdays from 9am-Noon. * WMIC 660 AM is home to \\"Swap Shop\\" a buy, sell, and trading show from 1 to 2 pm weekdays, and 8 am Saturdays.

After 6:15 pm weekdays (pending on sign off time), the station is completely dedicated to music. * Staff list includes reporter and General Manager Bob Armstrong, Assistant Manager Nick Lien, Program Director and Morning Show Host Eddie Fury, News Director Dave Fredrick and Paul Osentoski. WMIC has faced tough competition in the Thumb Area Radio Region, due to its full service format. WLEW in Bad Axe also features a show similar to \\"Swap Shop\\", and features a more music-intensive country format.

This operation is most commonly done to relieve constrictive pericarditis or to remove a pericardium that is calcified and fibrous. There are many etiologies for constrictive pericarditis and it is better to know the exact cause as the post operative morbidity, mortality, and life expectancy are strongly influenced by the cause. It takes place by removing the infected, fibrosed, or otherwise damaged pericardium. The procedure begins when the surgeon makes an incision in the skin over the breastbone and divides the breastbone to expose the pericardium. During the surgery, the surgeon will grasp the pericardium, cut the top of this fibrous covering of the heart, drop it into the specimen bag, and re-cover the heart. The breastbone is then wired back together and the incision is closed, completing the procedure. When the portion of pericardium lying between the two phrenic nerves is excised it is called total pericardiectomy. In cases where total pericardiectomy is not possible, subtotal pericardiectomy is performed or, in extreme cases, a cruciate incision on the pericardium is performed.

Childhood  Juhan (birth names Johannes) Liiv the son of Benjamin and Marianna Liiv was born on April 30, 1864, in Alatskivi Parish, Tartu County, and grew up in Rupsi village, in Oja farm owned by his family. Although at the time it was called the village of Allatzkiwwi, Governorate of Livonia, Russian Empire. Liiv grew up in a poor and religious family and was the youngest amongst five children. Liiv‚Äôs parents were heavily religious. At home, he and his siblings lived a rough Christian life, his parents tried to raise their children in the same Christian spirit . Despite their poverty and religion, Liiv's parents understood the importance of education and invested a lot of money in his education. He first studied at Naelavere Village School, then at Kodavere Parish School. After going through both schools his parents then sent him to Dorpat (present-day Tartu) to study at the Hugo Treffner Gymnasium, in 1886. Juhan spent most of his childhood alone, isolated from other children his age. His older brother Jakob Liiv also became a poet. Illness forced Liiv to leave school and return home, where he wrote poetry and occasional columns for the Olevik newspaper. His poetry starkly contrasted that of his contemporaries, and was therefore largely ignored. Short stories Liiv finally achieved success in 1894 when his first short story, Vari (The Shadow), was published. It was dark and gloomy, foreshadowing his future works of both prose and poetry. Many readers draw a comparison between Liiv and the main character of the story, Villu, who is physically weak but strong in mind. Liiv continued to write several more short stories, but none are as famous as Vari. Mental illness Shortly after Vari was released, Liiv became a patient in a psychiatric clinic in Tartu. Liiv was diagnosed with Schizophrenia. He variably thought he was the son of the Emperor Alexander II, the king of Poland. His struggles with mental illness continued until his death. Grave of Juhan Liiv in Alatskivi cemetery. Poetry In 1909, Friedebert Tuglas met with Liiv. A book containing 495 poems by Liiv was published late that year. Many of Liiv's poems are dominated by a sense of gloom, probably brought on by his mental illnesses, poverty and lack of human friendships. The few poems with a less ominous tone describe nature and Liiv's adoration for his country. His poems include: *The Axe and the Forest *Who Does Not Remember the Past (is Living Without the Future) *To The Poets *I Saw Estonia Yesterday *Come Now, Night Darkness *Cold *Snowflake Death On 1 December 1913, Liiv was found aboard a train without a ticket because he could not afford one. He was thrown off into a deserted area and walked home. By the time he arrived, however, he had been in freezing temperatures for two weeks and had contracted a fatal case of pneumonia. Which in turn led to the death of Liiv. The Juhan Liiv Prize for Poetry The Juhan Liiv Prize for Poetry was founded in 1965. It is awarded by the parish of Alatskivi on 30 April every year. The prize is a leather shepherd's bag hand-made by a local artist.

Prior to this in 1967, he served as the Sierra Leonean Ambassador of to the United States. He was the acting Governor-General of Sierra Leone from 18 April 1968 until 22 April 1968. He led the Sergeants' Coup in 1968 that successfully re-instated civilian rule in Sierra Leone.  Early life  Bangura was born on 8 March 1930 at Kalangba, Karene Chiefdom, Bombali District, British Sierra Leone. He was educated at Binkolo and Rogbaneh American Wesleyan Mission Schools, and Koyeima and Bo Government Secondary Schools. He left school in 1949 and joined the Army in 1950 as an ordinary soldier. While in the other ranks he served and attended courses in both Ghana and Nigeria. In one such course, the Platoon Commanders' course in Burma Camp, Teshie, Ghana, he graduated first in a group of sixteen Warrant Officers and Senior Non-Commissioned Officers. The impressive qualities of leadership manifested in his keen sense of duty, intelligence, and fitness recommended him to face the Special Selection Board at which the late General Sir Lashmer Whistler, C.M.G., D.S.O., O.B.E., M.C., then Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal West African Frontier Force was chairman. His performance at Teshie Camp necessitated his transfer to Eaton Hall, Mons Officer Cadet School in 1952. At Mons Officers' Cadet School he was recommended by British Army authorities to go to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He graduated at Sandhurst in August 1954 with the rank of Second Lieutenant. After a successful Young Officers' Course at Hythe and Warminster, he was posted on secondment to the British Army on the Rhine in Germany. While on secondment he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant. He returned to Sierra Leone in 1955 and was appointed Commander or a Rifle Company's Platoon in the First Battalion, Royal Sierra Leone Regiment. In 1958 he was promoted to the rank of Captain. In 1962 he served with the First Sierra Leone Contingent on the Congo Operations of the United Nations Organization (U.N.O.C.). On his return home that year he was promoted to the rank of Major. Brigadier John Amadu Bangura became Commander of the First Battalion Royal Sierra Leone Regiment in 1964 when he attained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. These promotions were preceded or followed by several successful courses in various Military Centers in the United Kingdom. One such course was the All Arms Division Course for substantive Majors in the British Army. In 1966 he was posted to attend the Joint Services Staff College (J.S.S.C.) in Latimer, Buckinghamshire. He was a fellow of the College. In the same year, he was promoted to the rank of Colonel. After a period of successful military career, he was arrested and detained at Pademba Road Prisons prior to the March 1967 General Elections. He was however released in March that year and appointed Counsellor and Head of the Chancery at the Sierra Leone Embassy in Washington D.C. He mysteriously disappeared from his post to become Chairman of the National Interim Council (N.I.C.) which brought back Civilian Rule after a successful take over by the Other Ranks from the Military Junta, the National Reformation Council (N.R.C.) in 1968. He became Commander of the First Battalion, Royal Sierra Leone Regiment and of the Royal Sierra Leone Military Forces after this operation. On 1 May 1969, he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier and honored in the 1970 New Year Honours with the C.B.E. (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) (Military Division). Brigadier John Amadu Bangura's through military training and great experience made him what he was a rare soldier. He was married and had eight children.  Sergeants' Coup  Bangura played a pivotal role in the history of post-colonial Sierra Leone. A staunch Democrat, he took issue when the government began to collapse after a series of coups that followed the hotly contested elections of March 1967. Bangura formed the Anti-Corruption Revolutionary Movement (ACRM) with a group of non-commissioned officers. In April 1968, Bangura led the Sergeants' Coup and overthrew Brigadier Andrew Juxon-Smith and his National Reformation Council (NRC). Bangura arrested every high-ranking officer in the army and police so that he could restore the constitution and democracy to Sierra Leone. There was another side to Bangura. Some accused him of being a bully, a tribalist, with no regard for authority in the military, as violent and having no principles. Being an army personnel, he betrayed his profession not once but twice. Firstly, by joining Stevens and other APC cohorts to plan an invasion of Sierra Leone, the very country he was employed and nurtured to protect and defend. The army was unhappy about this but the worst was to come when Bangura connived with some NCOs to overthrow the NRC government and impose Stevens on the people. Some argued that Stevens knew his violent potential and his position in the heart and mind of the army. Some of Bangura's associates were in the pay pocket of Stevens, hence they were spies. Bangura did plan a coup and Stevens knew every stage of the process that he let it go on to have grounds to liquidate Bangura. The army was happy to see the end of Bangura and when the hour came, they looked the other way while Bangura and his political friend slugged it out. Bangura was political army personnel, while Sir Albert, as a lawyer was a constitutionalist and resorted to due process. Stevens was a thug (rally man) and street graduate and enjoyed sending closed associates to the gallows and displayed their bodies in public as a trophy of political prowess. Stevens was quoted as saying that he was no Sir Albert who was afraid of Bangura thus sending him abroad as a diplomat that he (Stevens) would teach Bangura a lesson in politics by sending him down the gallows. When this hour came, Bangura had no ally and he was left in the hands of his former friend turned enemy. Bangura was appointed acting Governor-General of Sierra Leone by the ACRM. Bangura, who was not politically ambitious, served briefly from 18 April 1968 to 22 April 1968. He gave the post of Prime Minister to Siaka Stevens, leader of the All People's Congress, the post of Prime Minister. Bangura did not do this for any personal reasons but because his predecessor Governor General Sir Henry Lightfoot Boston had declared the APC the winners of the election.  Political prisoner  Bangura was a magnetic and popular figure. The army was devoted to him and this made him potentially dangerous to Stevens' new agenda in the shifting political climate of Sierra Leone. Bangura was widely considered the only person who could put the brakes on Stevens. Stevens had campaigned on a platform of socialist principles. However, when he became Prime Minister he abandoned his pre-election promises and employed an authoritarian model of governance.The Final Report of the Truth & Reconciliation Commission of Sierra Leone. Bangura, an ardent Democrat, was greatly disappointed and he criticised Stevens' policies. Stevens began to cut funds for the army which he saw as a threat to him attaining absolute power. Bangura spoke out against the Stevens regime and was promptly arrested in 1970. He was charged with conspiracy and plotting to commit a coup d'√©tat against the Stevens government.  Execution  In 1970, Prime Minister Stevens had Bangura arrested and charged with conspiracy. Bangura was sentenced to death by execution for treason against the state. In spite of the fact that Bangura had put Stevens in power after The 1968 Sergeants' Coup, his requests for clemency were denied. On 29 March 1970, the day of his execution, Bangura wept in disbelief and refused to be led to the gallows. He was beaten to death and concentrated acid was poured on his remains. To prevent people from making a martyr of Bangura, Stevens ordered his body to be buried at an undisclosed location which he had paved over with the Kissy Road. After Stevens retired from office he told a reporter that he regretted having Bangura killed, stating \\"I should not have allowed those executions.\\" Siaka Stevens wrote in his book,\\"I am fully aware that many people were shocked when these sentences were carried out and that even today, much speculation goes on as to what prompted me to allow the law to take its course. There is even a fantastic rumour circulating that I had actually decided to commute the sentences to terms of imprisonment but that certain strong party members had forced me to change my mind. Let me put the record straight here and now. No single person, nor even the demonstrations in favour of the death sentence that filed through the city, had any influence whatsoever on the action I was obliged to take. For me it was a dreadful act. I had to wrench myself out of my own character.\\"The New Citizen Publications References Sierra Leonean politicians Sierra Leonean Christians Leaders who took power by coup Governors-General of Sierra Leone Sierra Leonean military personnel 1970 deaths 1920 births Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Graduates of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst Executed Sierra Leonean people People executed by Sierra Leone by hanging 20th-century executions by Sierra Leone 20th-century Sierra Leonean politicians People from Bombali District ","title":"John Amadu Bangura"},{"id":"5800096","text":"Madhusudanpur is a census town in Chinsurah Mogra CD Block in Chinsurah subdivision of Hooghly district in the Indian state of West Bengal.

The temple is about 1300 years old. Sita resides in the temple as Sri Janaki Valli. The other deities enshrined are Sri Chakrathalwar, Sri Ramanuja, Sri Lakshmi Narasimha and Sri Hanuman. The Kodandaramaswamy temple has two sets of utsavar idols of the presiding deity and His consort, and Lakshmana. While one deity is named Rama, the other is known as Karunakaran. There is also a separate shrine for Goddess Sita, known as Janakavalli Thayar, which is claimed to be very rare. This shrine was built by an English Collector, Colonel Lionel Blaze who assured the people that he would build a shrine for Devi if the newly built surplus water weirs withstood the fury of monsoon rains. The huge tank with immense storage capacity would breach every year after the monsoon rains and wash away the rough stone-built outlet of the tank. While camping at Madurantakam during a monsoon night, the tank was full and almost overflowing. The Collector visited the tank bund and is said to have seen Rama and Lakshmana keeping guard at the tank. The construction of the shrine for the Goddess began the very next morning and the Lord is known as Eri Katha Ramar as he saved the tank bund from collapsing. * Thiru-Venkateswarar Temple near Madurantakam railway station, too a renowned temples in the town.

Due to the migration of South Indians, banana leaf rice can also be found in areas with significant ethnic South Indian diaspora such as Malaysia and Singapore. In banana leaf meals, white rice (or parboiled rice in authentic South Indian restaurants) is served on a banana leaf with an assortment of vegetables, pickles, appalam and other regional condiments (usually sour, salty or spicy). The banana leaf acts as a disposable plate and it in itself is not consumed. The choice of banana leaves is mainly due to the broad leaves as well as to the ubiquity of the plant in South India. Typically, only vegetarian gravy (e.g. sambar) will be served on the rice as it is meant to be a traditional vegetarian dish. However, sometimes boiled eggs, curried or fried meat or seafood are served as well. Traditionally, there will be two servings of rice with the first being served with gravy, side dishes and condiments whilst the second serving will be just rice with curd as a palate cleanser. Banana leaf meals are eaten by hand. Traditionally only the right hand is used, and only the tips of the fingers should touch the food. Any part of the finger beyond the first knuckle or the palm must not touch the food. Parts of the Banana leaf meal etiquette also dictates that, after the meal, the guest must always fold the banana leaf inwards as a sign of gratitude to the host, even when the host is the proprietor of an eatery. However, when meals are served at funeral wakes, the leaf is folded outwards as a sign of condolence to the family of the deceased. Due to this, folding the leaf outwards is considered rude in any other circumstance.

Opened in 1908 with 50 inmates in makeshift facilities, today the prison holds more than 750 male offenders, the vast majority of which are maximum-security inmates. Construction and early years Before Oklahoma became a state in 1907, felons convicted in Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were sent to the Kansas State Penitentiary in Lansing, Kansas. At statehood, Kate Barnard became Oklahoma Commissioner of Charities and Corrections. During the summer of 1908, Barnard arrived unannounced at the Kansas prison to investigate widespread complaints she had received about mistreatment of Oklahoma inmates. She took a regular tour with other visitors first, then identified herself to prison officials and asked that she be allowed to conduct an inspection of the facility. Barnard discovered systematic, widespread torture of inmates. Upon her return to Oklahoma, Barnard recommended that all Oklahoma inmates be removed from the Lansing facility and returned to the state. Governor of Oklahoma Charles N. Haskell supported Barnard's proposal, and within two months of Barnard's visit to Kansas, on October 14, 1908, two groups of 50 offenders each were sent by train to McAlester. The inmates were temporarily housed in the former federal jail in the town. Under direction from Warden Robert W. Dick, they built a stockade to house themselves on a plot northwest of McAlester, which was donated to the state by a group of McAlester citizens. The remaining Oklahoma inmates in Lansing were moved to the United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth until the state could build adequate facilities to house them all. The next spring, in 1909, the Oklahoma Legislature appropriated $850,000 to build the permanent facility. Construction began in May 1909 on a prison designed after the Leavenworth facility. The state purchased about surrounding the original plot of land. Using prison labor, the West Cellhouse and Administration Building were completed first; the Rotunda and East Cellhouse came later. The steep hills and grades required more than of concrete and more than of rocks and soil to be moved for the prison's walls alone. The F Cellhouse was added in 1935, and later the New Cellhouse was constructed. A shoe manufacturing plant and a tailor shop were part of the prison's inmate industry program, designed to provide work for offenders; at Lansing, prisoners were forced to work in the local mines, a practice Barnard banned. The Warden's House, across the street from the prison, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Female prisoners were sent to Kansas in territorial days also. The first females brought back from Kansas stayed in a ward near the East Gate, built in 1911, on the fourth floor of the West Cellhouse. The female population had grown to 26 by the time a separate building about west of the main institution was completed in 1926. The first prison escape (from behind the walls) occurred on January 19, 1914. Three inmates stole a gun and killed three prison employees and retired federal judge John Robert Thomas during the escape attempt. The convicts were later killed behind a rock ledge located on a ridge overlooking a wagon road.  Riots and lawsuits  By the early 1970s, advocacy groups warned the state government that the situation was becoming dire. From 1970 until July 27, 1973 the facility cataloged 19 violent deaths, 40 stabbings and 44 serious beatings. On January 22, 1973, prisoners staged a hunger strike that lasted 3 days in an attempt to draw attention to the conditions at the facility. On July 27, 1973, trouble began in the prison's mess hall, reportedly started by five inmates who, according to a prison spokesman, \\"were doped up on something.\\" It quickly spread through the rest of the facility. At the end of the riot three days later, three inmates were dead, 12 buildings were burned, and 21 inmates and guards had been injured. Damage was estimated at $30 million. A federal court in 1978 found conditions at OSP unconstitutional. The lawsuit, filed by one inmate before the riot, was changed to a class action suit after the riot. U.S. District Judge Luther Bohannon put the Department of Correction under federal control. The last issue of the lawsuit, medical care for offenders, was settled 27 years later, in 2001. Consequent to the court's orders, four new housing units were built at OSP, and in 1984 the aging East and West Cellhouses were closed. In 1983, all female inmates were moved to Mabel Bassett Correctional Center in Oklahoma City. On December 17, 1985, the inmates became disruptive, then gained control and took five employees as hostages on A and C units. Three of the hostages were seriously injured before their release the next day. The disturbance caused more than $375,000 in damage and two of the hostages were permanently disabled. After this incident, security was overhauled at the prison to reduce inmate movements, limit recreation, and institute a level-ranking system for offenders to improve safety. The Talawanda Heights Minimum Security Unit was opened outside the East Gate Area in October 1989 to house inmates who hold support jobs inside the facility. In 1992, a special care unit opened to provide mental health care to offenders, reducing the need for psychiatric hospitalization outside the prison. A medium security unit with a capacity of 140 inmates is located on G and I units to help prisoners adjust to a lower security classification. Another addition to the prison, H Unit, houses inmates under both administrative and disciplinary segregation. H Unit is also the site of Oklahoma's death row and the state's lethal injection death chamber. Death Row and executions Between 1915 and 2014, Oklahoma executed a total of 192 men and 3 women. 3 different methods of execution have been employed by the state. Lethal injection, which was first used on September 10, 1990 has been used 112 times. Other execution methods have included the hanging of a federal prisoner, and 82 electrocutions using the electric chair commonly referred to as \\"Old Sparky\\", a method that was last performed in 1966. In March 2015, Gov. Mary Fallin signed into law HB1879 providing for nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative to the primary execution method of lethal injection. In March 2018, Attorney General Michael J. Hunter and Corrections Director Joe M. Allbaugh announced that Oklahoma would start using inert gas asphyxiation as the primary method of execution. Oklahoma Department of Corrections has had difficulty obtaining the drugs used to perform lethal injections. Prison rodeo Starting in 1940, except for a handful of years during World War II and during the 1970s inmate uprising, OSP held a prison rodeo until 2009. A two-day event was held in August, or on Labor Day weekend. (accounts differ), the rodeo was a joint venture between the city of McAlester and the state Department of Corrections.. The McAlester Chamber of Commerce contracted with the city to coordinate and market the event, which was last held in 2009 due to a state budget shortfall starting in 2010. Inmates from several prisons throughout the state competed. Attendance at the 12,500-seat arena was down in the 2000s from the 65,000 who routinely attended during a four-day version of the event in the 1960s. The animal-rights group PETA denounced the rodeo on grounds of animal cruelty. Female convicts began competing in 2006, leading to the documentary film, Sweethearts of the Prison Rodeo (2009), about the co-ed competition.. Use in popular culture The prison was mentioned in: * The Grapes of Wrath and in the Woody Guthrie song The Ballad Of Tom Joad, which was based on the book * The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town, a nonfiction book by John Grisham * Dirty White Boys, a fiction book by Stephen Hunter * The Outsider, a novel by Stephen King * The Longest Yard (1974 film) Has a scene where a player says he played football at Oklahoma State.

Indus Valley Civilization sites  There are large sand dunes about five kilometers away on the city's western fringe. In ancient times, the area's name was Mahahattam. About two big ponds and a dozen smaller ones were created by the Indus Valley Civilisation to trap runoff rainwater in them, which could last for a full year until the next rainfall replenished the supply. There are a few myths of that culture that concern the area of Maham. Archaeological excavations in the region on land about the area of a dozen village estates have yielded well-documented finds, which have shed light on the pre-Harappan settlements, particularly at Madina and Farmana Khas. Dr. Vasant Shinde of the Deccan College in Pune, Dr. Manmohan Singh of Maharshi Dayanand University in Rohtak, and other Japanese scientists explored these archaeological finds.  Early history  Maham suffered a setback during the invasion of the Ghaznavids under the command of Sultan Mahmud (lived 971 ‚Äì 1030 AD) and later when his son Mas'ud I (998 ‚Äì 1040 AD) sacked the town. A few centuries later, during the reign of the Turkic Muslim ruler Firuz Shah Tughlaq (1309 ‚Äì 1388 AD), the town was resettled, and agricultural operations resumed.  Maham during Mughal rule  Maham was a thriving town during the Mughal Empire.  Maham Fort  The Mughals posted a garrison commander at Maham and built a small fort that is now in complete ruins except for its ramparts.

It stars Robert Mitchum, Martin Sheen, Bruce Dern, Stacy Keach and Paul Sorvino, who had also appeared in the play and was the only cast member who appeared in the play. Plot It has been 25 years since the 1957 Fillmore High School basketball team won the Pennsylvania state championship. The coach and four of the victors regularly gather to relive the glory of their shining moment. As teenage teammates they could read each other's moves on the court without fail. As middle-aged men, each is facing his own different mid-life crisis. With a former coach that still addresses problems as if his boys are having a bad game, the friends' longtime loyalty to one another begins to unravel. George Sitkowski is mayor of Scranton and engaged in a fierce campaign for re- election. James Daley is an overwrought and underpaid school principal while his brother, Tom, has become a drifter with a serious drinking problem. Phil Romano is the wealthiest among them. He often bends the law and even betrays a friend to indulge his own needs, but George badly needs his support. The intended celebratory nature of this reunion is quickly dissipated. Various contentions arise among the four old teammates, who quickly turn on one another. The coach's bigotry‚Äîthen and now‚Äîand his selfish disregard for fair play are brought again to the surface. The absence of the team's star player, who hates the coach, serves to further spotlight the futility and hollowness of this gathering. Cast *Robert Mitchum as Coach Daniel B. Delaney *Martin Sheen as Tom Daley *Stacy Keach as James Daley *Bruce Dern as George Sitkowski *Paul Sorvino as Phil Romano *Arthur Franz as Macken Production Jason Miller's play opened off-Broadway in 1972. After critical acclaim and 144 performances, it moved to a Broadway theater for a run of 844 more performances before closing on April 21, 1974. Scenes from the film were shot in Scranton, Pennsylvania in the summer of 1982. Miller cited his upbringing and education in Scranton and said he was \\"only giving back to Scranton what it gave to me.\\" Locations during the three weeks of Scranton shooting included Nay Aug Park and the then-vacant Erie-Lackawanna Railroad Station. The score by composer Bill Conti (Rocky, The Right Stuff, For Your Eyes Only) was supplemented by the West Scranton High School Band. A limited-release 1200 copy soundtrack cd was released on the La-La Land Records label in 2009.https://www.discogs.com/Bill-Conti-That-Championship-Season-Original- Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/release/3529159 William Friedkin was originally going to direct the movie (he had worked with Jason Miller before on The Exorcist). Before he dropped out, Friedkin offered the part of Coach Delaney to William Holden. Holden was interested but died before he could accept the part. The stars and director were paid $250,000 each plus a percentage of the profits. The film did a great deal to help the reputation of the fledgling Cannon Films, who financed it.Andrew Yule, Hollywood a Go-Go: The True Story of the Cannon Film Empire, Sphere Books, 1987 p25 Critical reception The film has a 71% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Los Angeles Times critic Sheila Benson observed similarities to the plot of the Robert Altman film Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean, but said that while the Altman film \\"resonates deeply,\\" Championship Season \\"doesn't even last until its over.\\" She criticized Mitchum's performance as lacking power, and that the film was replete with racist dialogue without making it clear if the racism was embraced by the characters. Writing in The New York Times, Vincent Canby called the cast \\"excellent\\" and said Mitchum's \\"laid-back, relaxed authority works very well for the coach, possibly because it hides for as long as possible the revelation that the coach is not only a sentimental bigot but an adolescent emotionally and as underhanded as any of his 'boys.'\\" But Canby criticized the upbeat ending as \\"unbelievable and, worse, attempts to balance - in a wishy-washy way - the terrible truths that have been so carefully laid out earlier.\\" New York Daily News critic Kay Gardella wrote that \\"Miller's vitriolic play loses much of its dramatic intensity on the screen.\\" She praised the performances but said that Mitchum's performance \\"seems a little sluggish.\\" Gannett News Service said that the Scranton locations sometimes serve only to \\"disguise the fact that it is essentially a play, not a movie.\\" Critic Bernard Drew said that Miller had broken up his acts, which had sustained audience attention as a play, \\"into a series of confrontations.\\" Awards Bruce Dern won the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 33rd Berlin International Film Festival. However, the film was not a hit at the box office, and it lost money.  Subsequent adaptation  In 1999, Sorvino directed an adaptation of the play for Showtime in which he played Mitchum's role as the coach. This version co-starred Vincent D'Onofrio, Gary Sinise, Tony Shalhoub and Terry Kinney. Home media In 2004, the film was released on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment.

Although the curiae continued throughout Roman history, the three original tribes that they constituted gradually vanished from history.Livy, x. 6. Perhaps influenced by the original division of the people into tribes, as well as the number of thirty wards, Servius Tullius established thirty new tribes, which later constituted the comitia tributa. This number was reduced to twenty at the beginning of the Roman Republic; but as the Roman population and its territory grew, fifteen additional tribes were enrolled, the last in 241 BC. All Roman citizens were enrolled in one of these tribes, through which they were entitled to vote on the election of certain magistrates, religious officials, judicial decisions in certain suits affecting the plebs, and pass resolutions on various proposals made by the tribunes of the plebs and the higher magistrates. Although the comitia tributa lost most of its legislative functions under the Empire, enrollment in a tribe remained an important part of Roman citizenship until at least the third century AD.Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities, Second Edition, Harry Thurston Peck, Editor (1897), \\"Comitia\\". The Romulean tribes The first three tribes are said to have been established by Romulus, the founder and first King of Rome, shortly after the foundation of the city. Following the Rape of the Sabine Women, the Sabines under Titus Tatius attacked Rome, and successfully entered the city. After fierce fighting, the Sabine women themselves interceded, stepping between their husbands and their fathers to prevent further bloodshed. Peace was concluded, with Romulus and Tatius ruling jointly, and a large Sabine population relocating to Rome; the nascent city was thus evenly divided between Latins and Sabines. At this time (traditionally 750 BC), Romulus divided the people into three tribes, known as the Ramnes or Ramnenses, named after himself; the Tities or Titienses, named after Titus Tatius; and the Luceres or Lucerenses, whose name and origin were obscure even to the ancient historians.Livy, i. 9‚Äì13. Known as the three Romulean tribes, these first tribes have often been supposed to represent the major ethnic groups of early Rome: the Ramnes representing Rome's Latin population; the Tities representing the Sabines; and the Luceres probably representing the Etruscans. Rome lay on the Tiber, the traditional boundary of Etruria with Latium, and may have had a substantial Etruscan population from the beginning; but certainly there was a considerable Etruscan element in the Roman population by the sixth century BC; the fifth and seventh kings of Rome were Etruscan, and many of Rome's cultural institutions were of Etruscan origin. It may be to this period, rather than the time of Romulus, that the institution of the Luceres belongs; and indeed the names, if not the ethnic character, of all three of the Romulean tribes appear to be Etruscan.Robert Maxwell Ogilvie, A Commentary on Livy, Books I‚ÄìV (1965). Although the theory that the Romulean tribes represented the city's original ethnic components continues to be represented in modern scholarship, it has never been universally accepted, and this view is rejected by many scholars.Cornell, pp. 114, 115. The curiae These three tribes were in turn divided into thirty curiae, or wards, the organization of which is unclear; they were said to have been named after thirty of the Sabine Women, but of the nine curiae whose names are known today, several are of geographical origin. The only curiae whose names are now known were: Acculeia, Calabra, Faucia, Foriensis, Rapta, Tifata, Titia, Veliensis, and Velitia.Varro, De Lingua Latina.Livy, ix. 38.Festus.Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities, \\"Curia.\\"C. J. Smith, The Roman Clan, p. 204. In the past, it was widely believed that membership in the curiae was limited to the patricians, and that statements to the contrary, indicating that clientes were admitted meant no more than that they were passive members with no voting rights. However, Mommsen argued convincingly that the plebeians were included in voting, and this view now appears to have prevailed; the plebeians were included either from the beginning, or at least from an early date; certainly from the earliest years of the Republic.Mommsen, R√∂mische Forschungen i. 140‚Äì150. The members of the curiae were known as curiales. Each curia was attended by a priest, or curio, who assisted by another priest, known as the flamen curialis, undertook the religious obligations of the ward. Each had its own place of meeting, also known as a curia. The comitia curiata When the various curiae were assembled for voting, they formed the comitia curiata, the oldest legislative assembly of the Roman Republic. One of the curiones was appointed or elected curio maximus, and presided over the assembly.Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities, \\"Curio.\\" Under the kings, the comitia curiata was summoned by the king or by an interrex, who would present questions upon which the comitia might vote. These included the election of a new king, as proposed by the interrex; the passing of a law conferring imperium on the king, known as a lex curiata de imperio; whether to declare war; rulings on appeals; matters relating to arrogatio; and whether to allow foreigners to be received among the patricians. Under Servius Tullius, the rights to declare war and to decide appeals were transferred to the comitia centuriata, another legislative assembly. After the downfall of the Roman monarchy, questions were presented to the comitia curiata by the Roman Senate. However, between 494 and 449 BC, most of its functions were relegated to the comitia tributa and the comitia centuriata. The higher magistrates were elected by the comitia centuriata, which also presided over certain capital trials, and held the power to declare war, and to pass legislation presented by the senate. Lesser magistrates were elected by the comitia tributa, which also elected religious officials, presided over trials affecting the plebeians, and passed resolutions based on legislation proposed by the tribunes of the plebs and various magistrates. The comitia curiata retained the power to confer imperium on magistrates elected by the comitia centuriata, and to confirm alterations in the Roman constitution decided upon by the other two comitia; both of these, however, required the senate to propose them before the comitia could act. The comitia also retained the power to decide whether to admit a non-patrician into that order, and to oversee the process of arrogatio, particularly when a patrician was being adopted into a plebeian family. By the late republic, each curia was represented by only one lictor. The Servian tribes CIL 13.1029) from Gallia Narbonensis, recording the enrollment of Gaius Otacilius in the tribus Voltinia (abbreviated VOL), into which Gallic citizens were frequently placed. The institution of the tribes that made up the comitia tributa, as well as the centuries of the comitia centuriata, occurred under Servius Tullius, the sixth king of Rome, whose reign is traditionally dated from 578 to 534 BC. According to Livy, Servius divided the city into four regions,Livy, i. 43. and the surrounding land into twenty-six, thus dividing the people into thirty tribes, based on geographic location. The names of the four \\"urban\\" tribes were based on the four regions of the city that they represented, while those of the \\"rural\\" or \\"rustic\\" tribes were likely based on the names of families that owned considerable tracts of land in those areas. Ten of the original rural tribes, whose names are lost to history, were destroyed in the war against Lars Porsena at the commencement of the Republic. Those that remained were the four urban tribes: Collina, Esquilina, Palatina, and Suburana (also called Succusana); together with sixteen rural tribes: Aemilia, Camilia, Cornelia, Fabia, Galeria, Horatia, Lemonia, Menenia, Papiria, Pollia, Popillia, Pupinia, Romilia, Sergia, Veturia, and Voltinia. Later tribes When the Sabine Appius Claudius removed to Rome together with his clientes, in 504 BC, he was admitted to the patriciate, and assigned lands in the region around the mouth of the Anio. These settlers became the basis of the tribus Claudia, which was admitted in 495 BC, during Claudius' consulship, and subsequently enlarged to become the tribus Crustumina or Clustumina.Livy, ii. 21. Four more tribes were added in 387 BC: Arniensis, Sabatina, Stellatina, and Tromentina. With the addition of Volscian territory in 358 BC, two more tribes were formed, Pomptina and Publilia (also found as Poblilia). In 332, the censors Quintus Publilius Philo and Spurius Postumius Albinus enrolled two more tribes, Maecia (originally Maicia) and Scaptia. Ufentina (or Oufentina) and Falerina followed in 318, and in 299 Aniensis and Terentina were added. The last two tribes, Quirina and Velina, were established in 241 BC, bringing the number of tribes to thirty-five. Eight tribes were added at the end of the Social War, when the Roman franchise was extended to the socii, but they were later absorbed into the other thirty-five. The thirty-five tribes (with their usual abbreviations) were: The four urban tribes * Collina () * Esquilina () * Palatina () * Suburana () The rural tribes * Aemilia () * Aniensis () * Arniensis () * Camilia () * Claudia () * Crustumina () * Cornelia () * Fabia () * Falerina () * Galeria () * Horatia () * Lemonia () * Maecia () * Menenia () * Papiria () * Pollia () * Pomptina () * Publilia () * Pupinia () * Quirina () * Romilia () * Sabatina () * Scaptia () * Sergia () * Stellatina () * Terentina () * Tromentina () * Ufentina () * Velina () * Veturia () * Voltinia () Although the names of the older rural tribes are those of patrician families, the tribes themselves were probably entirely plebeian until 449 BC, after which both patricians and plebeians were enrolled; before this time, many of the powers and responsibilities later held by the comitia tributa still belonged to the comitia curiata. While we know the origin of their names, the location of the territories which defined these tribes is uncertain. Subsequent tribes were based in territories where Roman settlements had been established, or in which the inhabitants had received the Roman franchise. In later periods, citizens might be enrolled in tribes without reference to geography. The enrollment of new citizens in particular tribes became a significant political issue during the censorship of Appius Claudius Caecus in 312 BC. Those who wished to limit the voting power of the lower social orders, and particularly of freedmen, advocated enrolling them only in the four urban tribes. This effort was largely unsuccessful, except with respect to freedmen, who were nearly always enrolled in one of the urban tribes. A similar attempt to limit the power of newly enfranchised citizens followed the end of the Social War. It was also possible for one of the censors to punish an individual by expelling him from one of the rustic tribes, and assigning him to one of the urban tribes; this was known as tribu movere. The tribes functioned as civil divisions of the populace for purposes of the census, taxation, and military service. Each tribe possessed its own officers, including a curator tribuum, who served as the head of the tribe, and tribuni aerarii, or tribunes of the treasury, whose responsibility was for the tribe's financial obligations; they were responsible for collecting the war tax, and distributed pay to the tribe's soldiers.Oxford Classical Dictionary, \\"Tribuni Aerarii.\\" Toward the end of the Republic, the importance of the tribus was such that it became an official part of a Roman's name, usually appearing, in the most formal documents and inscriptions, between a citizen's filiation and any cognomina. In imperial times, the enrollment of citizens in tribes along a geographic basis was resumed; for instance, easterners were typically enrolled in the tribes Collina and Quirina, while in Gallia Narbonensis enrollment in the tribus Voltinia was preferred. The comitia tributa A view of the Roman Forum from the Palatine Hill. Together, the Servian tribes constituted the concilium plebis, or plebeian council; as time passed and the council's authority to pass legislation developed, it was increasingly known as the comitia plebis tributa, or tribal assembly.Oxford Classical Dictionary, \\"Comitia.\\" A law passed in 449 BC made resolutions of the comitia tributa, known as plebi scita, or plebiscites, binding upon the whole Roman people; this law was not ratified by the senate until 286 BC, but even before this its resolutions were considered binding on the plebs. Because all citizens, whether patrician or plebeian, received the same vote in the comitia tributa, and because the assembly was much simpler to convene than the comitia centuriata, the comitia tributa was Rome's most democratic assembly. By the end of the Republic, the plebs greatly outnumbered the patricians, and it was through this comitia that the collective will of the citizens could be exercised without regard to wealth or status. Powers The comitia tributa elected all of the lower magistrates, including the tribunes of the plebs, the military tribunes, the plebeian aediles and the curule aediles. A committee of seventeen tribes, chosen by lot, nominated the Pontifex Maximus, and co√∂pted members of the collegia of the pontifices, augures, and the decemviri sacrorum. The comitia could pass resolutions proposed by the tribunes of the plebs, or by the higher magistrates, on both domestic and foreign matters, such as the making of treaties or concluding of peace. Proposals had to be published before receiving a vote, and were passed or rejected as a whole, without modification. Although the senate might review these resolutions, it could only reject them if they had been passed without the proper formalities. The comitia tributa also decided suits instituted by the plebeian tribunes and aediles, for offenses against the plebs or their representatives. In the later Republic, these suits typically involved charges of maladministration; the tribunes and aediles were entitled to levy substantial fines. Procedures Beginning with the institution of the tribunes of the plebs in 494 BC, the comitia tributa was normally summoned by the tribunes themselves. Magistrates could also convene the comitia, but only with the consent of the tribunes. The comitia was summoned by the proclamation of a praeco, a crier or herald, at least seventeen days before the meeting. The auspices would be taken, and the meeting could only proceed if they were favourable. The tribes convened at daybreak, and were obliged to adjourn at sunset. If summoned by one of the tribunes, the tribes had to gather within the city, or within a one-mile radius of the city; this was the boundary of a tribune's authority. In the first centuries of the Republic, the comitia usually met on the Capitol, in the Forum, or at the Comitium. If summoned by one of the magistrates, the comitia typically met on the Campus Martius. After a prayer, unaccompanied by sacrifice, proposals would be read, and the citizens arranged by tribe. The first tribe to vote, known as the principium, was chosen by lot, and the result of its vote announced. The other tribes would then vote simultaneously, and the results of their votes announced in an order also determined by lot, before the final result was proclaimed. Laws passed by the comitia took effect as soon as the results were announced. Although the order of voting was determined by lot, there was also an official order of the tribes, known as the ordo tribuum. The first four tribes were the urban tribes, in the order: Suburana, Palatina, Esquilina, Collina; the rural tribes followed, concluding with Aniensis. Decline In the final years of the Republic, participation in the comitia was quite low, and its acts increasingly the result of corruption. Caesar deprived the comitia tributa of the power to declare war or conclude peace; the early emperors further curtailed its power. Augustus removed the comitia's judicial function, and preserved its power to pass legislation only in form. He filled half of the available magistracies with his own candidates, and Tiberius transferred the comitia's remaining electoral authority to the senate. Although the emperors received many of their powers from the comitia tributa, this was only a formality. Although the comitia tributa continued to exist until the third century AD, its only remaining functions were symbolic; it took auspices and gave prayer; it conferred the emperor's legislative powers and other authority; and it proclaimed the laws presented to it for approval. But by this time voting was done not by ballot, but by acclamatio.

The Siria project has had two singles released into the German and Canadian markets featuring the vocals of Natalie Horler. On July 3, 2008, a cover of Myl√®ne Farmer's song Desenchantee was released by Zooland Records featuring a new vocalist. Career \\"Endless Summer\\" \\"Endless Summer\\" was released as the first single of the Siria project,. When it was first released to DJ's in December 2004, it introduced the music style that would prove very successful for the Cascada project with Everytime We Touch in 2005. Initially, fans of Cascada assumed that the group had changed their name to Siria due to legal problems with the name Cascada (they had previously been called Cascade until Kaskade threatened a lawsuit), though it was soon understood that this was just a side project of Manuel Reuter (DJ Manian) and Natalie Horler, without Yanou. \\"I Will Believe It\\" In early 2005, Siria released \\"I Will Believe It\\" on the \\"Endless Summer\\"/\\"I Will Believe It\\" 12\\" single. There are two mixes of the song. The first is a Euro-Trance version, which is similar to DJ Manian and Natalie's other single Reason released by another one of their projects, Diamond. The other remix is the \\"Cascada Remix\\", which has a darker but similar style to the then-recently released Everytime We Touch. The U.S. release of the single comes with eight mixes featuring DJ Lenny B, Solar City and is available through Marian Records, Inc. The single peaked at #23 on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Play chart. \\"A Never Ending Dream\\" In 2006, the song was covered by German group Cascada. This song appears on their 2006 debut album, Everytime We Touch. It was the fifth single released in Germany by Cascada in 2006. It was Cascada's 4th UK single. The video for this song was released on 11 May 2007 on the music channel 'Fizz' and 'The Box'. The music video is strongly themed on Middle Eastern culture with singer Natalie Horler dancing in traditional clothing in front of backdrops like the desert, a typical harem and hammam. Despite a good top 15 position in Ireland, in the UK it charted at #46, on its first week of physical release, a big disappointment considering that all previous singles in the UK had gone top 10. \\"Desenchantee\\" The Siria name was once again used for a new single featuring a new vocalist, a cover of French singer Myl√®ne Farmer's hit song \\"D√©senchant√©e\\", released by Zooland Records in Germany on July 3, 2008. Mislabelings Initially, Siria's songs were commonly mislabeled as Cascada's, due to Manian's production and Horler's vocals leading to similarity in musical style. This was complicated further by the inclusion of Siria's first two singles on Cascada's second album Perfect Day. Siria's future With the immense success of the Cascada project worldwide, DJ Manian had announced that there were no planned Siria singles for the near future. In the United Kingdom, both Siria songs were released under the Cascada name on Cascada's second album, Perfect Day, both in slightly edited forms in 2007. Due to both songs being previously released in the United States by Marian Records under the Siria name, I Will Believe It and Endless Summer were not included on the American release of Perfect Day, which instead featured exclusives songs not initially available in any other markets. However, I Will Believe It and Endless Summer are included, under the Siria name, on the dance compilation album Max Dance 07 Volume 1. In July 2008, the Siria name was brought back into use with the single \\"Desenchantee\\", though it does not feature Natalie Horler on vocals.

For the next 59 years, the Pope confined himself to Vatican City and claimed to be a prisoner in the Vatican to avoid the appearance of accepting the authority of the new Italian government and state. Aristocrats who had been ennobled by the Pope and were formerly subjects of the Papal states, including the senior members of the Papal Court, kept the doors of their palaces in Rome closed to mourn the Pope's confinement, which led to their being called the \\"black nobility\\". History Pius IX funeral escorted by the noble guard Despite the relatively recent name, the Black Nobility had existed for centuries, originating in the baronial class of Rome and in the powerful families who moved to Rome to benefit from a family connection to the Vatican. These supported the Popes in the governance of the Papal States and in the administration of the Holy See. Many of the members of Black Noble families also became high-ranking clergy and even Popes. Black Nobility families (in this instance families whose ancestors included Popes) still in existence include notably the Colonna, Massimo, Orsini, Ruspoli, Pallavicini, , Sacchetti, Borghese, Odescalchi, and . Major extinct papal families include the Savelli, Caetani, the Aldobrandini and Conti. Famous members of Black Nobility families include Arnaldo De Rosette, Bishop of Asti, who promulgated a Synod which provided some decrees to regulate and classify the clergy of Lombardy and Piedmont and its composition, with a particular emphasis on the Knights Hospitallers; Eugenio Pacelli, who later became Pope Pius XII; Ernesto Pacelli, an important financier; and Prospero Colonna, mayor of Rome. Following the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty in 1929, the Black Nobility were given dual citizenship in Italy and Vatican City. Under the provisions of the treaty, noble titles granted by the pope were recognized in the Kingdom of Italy. Many of these families were members of the largely ceremonial Papal Noble Guard; others were foreigners affiliated with the Holy See in various ways. In 1931, Pope Pius XI denied the request of Alfonso XIII of Spain to open the Noble Guard further to nobles from all Catholic countries. In World War II, the Papal Noble Guard guarded the Pope alongside the Swiss Guard.David Alvarez, The Pope's Soldiers: A Military History of the Modern Vatican (Lawrence, KS: University Press of Kansas, 2011), pp. 337 Pope Paul VI abolished many Vatican City positions with the motu proprio document Pontificalis Domus (English: The Papal Household) in 1968. As well as changing the name of the group from Papal Court to Papal Household, many of the positions occupied by the Black Nobility were abolished. According to the motu proprio: \\"Many of the offices entrusted to members of the Papal Household were deprived of their function, continuing to exist as purely honorary positions, without much correspondence to concrete needs of the times.\\"Pontificalis Domus, Introduction. Many of these positions and the Papal Court itself were still set up for administering the Papal States, which had been lost in 1870. The Black Nobility's perks, such as Vatican City licence plates, were also withdrawn. Some Black Nobles resented these changes. According to diplomat and author Roger Peyrefitte, it was members of the Black Nobility who first told him of the Pope's alleged association with an actor, which eventually led to Peyreffite's public statements and subsequent scandal.Leyland, Winston Gay Sunshine Interviews: Volume 2, Gay Sunshine Press 1982, p155 In May 1977, some members of the Black Nobility, led by Princess Elvina Pallavicini, started courting traditional Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre.

The criteria were published in February 2000 by an international collaboration including the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), National Cancer Institute of the United States, and the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group. Today, the majority of clinical trials evaluating cancer treatments for objective response in solid tumors use RECIST. These criteria were developed and published in February 2000, and subsequently updated in 2009. The criteria are specifically not meant to determine whether patients have improved or not, as these are tumor-centric, not patient centric criteria. This distinction must be made by both the treating physicians and the cancer patients themselves. Many oncologists in their daily clinical practice follow their patients' malignant disease by means of repeated imaging studies and make decisions about continuing therapy on the basis of both objective and symptomatic criteria. It is not intended that these RECIST guidelines play a role in that decision making, except if determined appropriate by the treating oncologist.  Features  The RECIST specification establishes a minimum size for measurable lesions, limits the number of lesions to follow and standardizes unidimensional measures.  Eligibility  * Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in protocols where objective tumor response is the primary endpoint. Measurable disease ‚Äì the presence of at least one measurable lesion. If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology. Measurable lesions ‚Äì lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter ‚â•20 mm using conventional techniques or ‚â•10 mm by spiral CT scan. Non-measurable lesions ‚Äì all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <20 mm with conventional techniques or <10 mm with spiral CT scan), i.e., bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, and also abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques. * All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of treatment. * The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. * Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  Methods of measurement  * CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure target lesions selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with cuts of 10 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously. Spiral CT should be performed using a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm. This applies to tumors of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Head and neck tumors and those of extremities usually require specific protocols. * Lesions on chest X-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable. * When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, ultrasound (US) should not be used to measure tumor lesions. It is, however, a possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions and thyroid nodules. US might also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical examination. * The utilization of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation has not yet been fully and widely validated. Their uses in this specific context require sophisticated equipment and a high level of expertise that may only be available in some centers. Therefore, the utilization of such techniques for objective tumor response should be restricted to validation purposes in specialized centers. However, such techniques can be useful in confirming complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained. * Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response when all lesions have disappeared. * Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases (e.g., after treatment to differentiate between residual benign lesions and residual malignant lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors).  Baseline documentation of \\"target\\" and \\"non-target\\" lesions  * All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. * Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically). * A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by which to characterize the objective tumor response. * All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  Response criteria  Evaluation of target lesions * Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions * Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD * Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started * Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions Evaluation of non-target lesions * Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level * Incomplete response or stable disease (SD): Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits * Progressive disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions Evaluation of best overall response The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). In general, the patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria * Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having ‚Äúsymptomatic deterioration‚Äù. Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. * In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) to confirm the complete response status.  Confirmation  * The main goal of confirmation of objective response is to avoid overestimating the response rate observed. In cases where confirmation of response is not feasible, it should be made clear when reporting the outcome of such studies that the responses are not confirmed. * To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments that should be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. Longer intervals as determined by the study protocol may also be appropriate. * In the case of SD, follow-up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval (in general, not less than 6‚Äì8 weeks) that is defined in the study protocol Duration of overall response * The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrence or PD is objectively documented, taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  Duration of stable disease  * SD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for disease progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started. * The clinical relevance of the duration of SD varies for different tumor types and grades. Therefore, it is highly recommended that the protocol specify the minimal time interval required between two measurements for determination of SD. This time interval should take into account the expected clinical benefit that such a status may bring to the population under study. Response review * For trials where the response rate is the primary endpoint it is strongly recommended that all responses be reviewed by an expert(s) independent of the study at the study's completion. Simultaneous review of the patients‚Äô files and radiological images is the best approach. Reporting of results * All patients included in the study must be assessed for response to treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible. Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories: 1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data). * All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria should be included in the main analysis of the response rate. Patients in response categories 4-9 should be considered as failing to respond to treatment (disease progression). Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate. Precise definitions for categories 4-9 will be protocol specific. * All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients. * Subanalyses may then be performed on the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those for whom major protocol deviations have been identified (e.g., early death due to other reasons, early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc.). However, these subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should be clearly reported. * The 95% confidence intervals should be provided. Immuno-oncology The RECIST criteria present problems for immunotherapies so around 2009 the immune-related response criteria were developed and are used in some immunotherapy clinical trials.  History  The World Health Organization published the first tumour response criteria in 1981. However the specification documents were unclear which led to criteria adjustments and inconsistent conclusions. In the mid-1990s, an International Working Party was created to simplify and standardize response criteria; it then published RECIST in 2000. These new criteria have been widely adopted and embraced by the regulatory authorities.

The depot is constructed of red brick laid in a Flemish bond pattern with stone trim and quoins on the building's corners; the overall architectural style is Jacobean Revival. A tall square clock tower is topped by a copper ogee dome with finial. Ornamented parapets with center cartouches and corner finials surround the dome. From March to November, 1981, the station was the eastern terminus of PennDOT's Parkway Limited train, which took commuters to Pittsburgh. Until 2005, Greensburg was served by the Three Rivers (a replacement service for the Broadway Limited), an extended version of the Pennsylvanian that terminated in Chicago. Its cancellation marked the first time in Greensburg's railway history that the town was served by a single daily passenger train.

He is the convicted mastermind in the murders of Eileen Sarmenta and Allan Gomez, both students of the University of the Philippines, Los Ba√±os (UPLB), in 1993.HighBeam The case against Sanchez in the Sarmenta-Gomez murder On the night of June 28, 1993, Eileen Sarmenta and Allan Gomez, students of the University of the Philippines, Los Ba√±os (UPLB), were abducted at gunpoint by men working for Antonio Sanchez, the mayor of Calauan, Laguna. The students were brought to Sanchez's farm in Barangay Curba, where both were bound and gagged. Court records showed Sanchez's men also brought Gomez along \\"to avoid complications\\". The students were brought inside a resthouse, where Sarmenta was taken into Sanchez's room while Gomez was beaten by Luis Corcolon, Rogelio \\"Boy\\" Corcolon, Zoilo Ama and George Medialdea and thereafter thrown out of the resthouse. Pepito Kawit struck Gomez's diaphragm with the butt of an Armalite, causing Gomez to fall against a cement box. Brion thought Allan was already dead, but Kawit said that his death would come later. Aurelio Centeno joined Sanchez's personal aides Edwin Cosico and Raul Alorico to watch television at the adjacent resthouse. Alorico told Centeno that Sanchez had been eagerly waiting for the group and worried that they would not arrive. At around 1:00 a.m. the next day, a crying Sarmenta was dragged out of the resthouse by Luis and Medialdea, still bound and gagged and now stripped of her shorts. Sanchez, clad merely in a white polo shirt, appeared and thanked Luis and Medialdea for the gift. He is alleged to have stated: \\"I am through with her. She's all yours.\\" When asked what would happen to Gomez, Medialdea assured the mayor that they would also kill him for full measure. The students were then loaded in a Tamaraw van by the appellants and headed for Calauan, followed closely by the ambulance. Kawit finished off Gomez with a single gunshot from his Armalite. The men then stopped at a sugarcane field in Sitio marupok, Kilometro 74 of Barangay Mabacan, and gang-raped Sarmenta. Kawit invited Centeno to join the assault, but Centeno refused as he could not, in conscience, bear the crime being committed. Despite Sarmenta's pleas to spare her life, Luis Corcolon fired his baby Armalite at her, and ordered Centeno to get rid of her body. Following separate investigations by different law enforcement agencies, prosecutors pursued charges against Sanchez and his men, but did not include Teofilo \\"Kit\\" Alqueza, son of Gen. Dictador Alqueza, as respondents. Sanchez had claimed Alqueza was the mastermind behind the incident. Sanchez's conviction On March 14, 1995, Pasig Judge Harriet Demetriou concluded the 16-month Sarmenta- Gomez murder trial with the finding that Calauan Mayor Antonio Sanchez and several henchmen (only some of whom were policemen) were guilty of raping and murdering Sarmenta and killing Sarmenta's boyfriend. Demetriou, in her 132-page decision, described the crime as being borne out of \\"a plot seemingly hatched in hell\\". Sanchez is currently serving seven (7) terms of reclusi√≥n perpetua (40 years per term) for the crime. On January 25, 1999, the Philippine Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Regional Trial Court. On August 29, 1999, Sanchez was given a double life term by the Supreme Court for a different case. Together with his seven life terms for the Sarmenta-Gomez murder, Sanchez will have to spend a total of 360 years in jail.  Release order controversy  A report by GMA News showed that Sanchez could have walked free in August 2019, according to a document bearing the signature of Bureau of Corrections director Nicanor Faeldon. The document said the release order was for one Antonio Leyza Sanchez, \\"who was found to have served 40 years upon retroactive application of RA No. 10592 and was certified to have no other legal cause to be further detained, shall be released from confinement.\\" RA 10592 is the law allowing convicts an early release based on good conduct time allowance (GCTA). Sanchez's kin had said that they were informed about Sanchez's impending release, but public outrage prompted the government to review the GCTA law. Popular culture Sanchez' case was the inspiration for the 1994 film Humanda Ka Mayor!: Bahala Na Ang Diyos. The film, produced by Regal Films and Golden Lions Productions, is based on Mayor Sanchez's account and criminal activities (with his name in the film changed to \\"Mayor Miguel Beltran\\").

Description The regal ringneck snake is typically gray in color, with a dark-speckled white or cream underside, which becomes bright red or orange near and under the tail.Conant, Roger. 1975. A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition. Houghton Mifflin. Boston. 429 pp. (Diadophis punctatus regalis, pp. 173-174, Figure 38., Map 133.) It is distinguished by a yellow to orange ring around its neck which is typically bordered with black. However, the neck ring is frequently absent in this subspecies. The belly color extends onto one or more dorsal scale rows.Smith, H.M., and Brodie, E.D., Jr. 1982. Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification. Golden Press. New York. 240 pp. (Diadophis punctatus regalis, pp. 160-161.) They are among the larger of the ringneck snake subspecies, growing to a total length (including tail) of . Their dorsal scales are smooth. Habitat The regal ringneck snake is found in the desert, and in the mountains, unlike most snakes.Schmidt, K.P., and D.D. Davis. 1941. Field Book of Snakes of the United States and Canada. G.P. Putnam's Sons. New York. 365 pp. (Diadophis regalis regalis, p. 113.) Diet The regal ringneck snake, unlike other subspecies, is almost exclusively ophiophagous, having a diet that consists primarily of other snakes, such as the earth snakes (genus Virginia) and the blackhead or flathead snakes (genus Tantilla). They have enlarged rear teeth (opisthoglypha) and a weak venom that serves to immobilize their small prey, but is harmless to humans. Behavior Ringneck snakes are nocturnal, secretive snakes which spend most of their time hiding under rocks or other ground debris. If threatened, the ringneck snake typically hides its head and twists its tail in a corkscrew type motion, exposing its brightly colored underside, and expels a foul smelling musk from its cloaca. Reproduction Mating occurs throughout the warmer months, with 3 to 10 eggs being laid at a time in a moist, protected area, sometimes in a communal nest with the eggs of several other females. The eggs are on average 19 mm (¬æ in.) long by 7 mm (¬º in.) wide.Wright, A.H., and A.A. Wright. 1957. Handbook of Snakes of the United States and Canada. Comstock.

The Zay belong to the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. Local tradition suggests that the Zay people comprise three streams of people that populated the islands of Lake Ziway between the early 9th and the mid-17th centuries. It is believed that the Zay people spoke the ancient Harla language. The Zay economy is mainly based on subsistence agriculture and traditional fishing. The Zay people cultivate maize, sorghum, finger millet, teff, pepper and barley, and raise cattle, goats, sheep, donkeys and chicken. Island dwellers use papyrus boats for transport, while those on the shore use donkeys and horses. Common health issues include malaria, schistosomiasis, diarrhoea and respiratory diseases.

The temple of Baba Dirgheswar Nath, a deity of Shiva is nearby. It is believed to have been found and worshipped by Ashwathama, a character in the epic Mahabharata. History Majhauli Raj was the seat of an eponymous Rajput feudal estate known as the Majhauli raj, which is said to have been founded around 1100 CE. The traditional account traces its origins to a founder named Mayyur, who had children with three wives: one Brahmin, one Surajbans Rajput, and one Bhumihar, as well as one Kurmi concubine. His child by his Brahmin wife went on to become the ancestor of the Misra Brahmins; the child of his Bhumihar wife founded a kingdom that eventually became the Hathwa Raj and the Tamkuhi Raj; and the child of his Kurmi concubine went on to found the Kakradih estate. As for the son of his Rajput wife, he went on to conquer the pargana of Salempur and Majhauli, where he founded a fort and established the Majhauli raj. In 1774, the raja of Majhauli, Ajit Mal, openly refused to pay revenue to the amil (collector) in Gorakhpur, crossing over into Bihar whenever the officials attempted to collect payment. He also gave refuge to the Narrowney Rajputs of Pachlakh, who were openly in arms against the British East India Company. In 1777, Ajit Mal also refused to pay revenues to the British for his lands in Bihar. The British, already beleaguered by the ongoing rebellion of Fateh Sahi of the Huseypur (Hathwa) raj, were initially unwilling to go after Ajit Mal: while they charged Fateh Sahi \\"guilty of the atrocious crime of premeditated murder and rebellion\\", they held Ajit Mal guilty of \\"no offence\\". When the authorities in Gorakhpur in Oudh State asked for assistance in pursuing Ajit Mal, the British refused. However, when the Gorakhpur authorities offered to join the fight against Fateh Sahi if the British helped them capture Ajit Mal, the British quickly agreed. They were, however, unsuccessful in both measures. Administration The town has 13 wards. Local self-government is at the level of Nagar Panchayat and every five years, people elect their representatives for their wards. The tehsil-level administration is located at Salempur.

The original Sly Fox Brewhouse & Eatery was founded by the Giannopoulos family at its original Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, location on December 20, 1995. The name of the establishment came out of a family meeting from the tradition of fox hunting in the Chester County area, where the first Sly Fox location resides. Sly Fox opened a second location on November 8, 2004, in Royersford, Pennsylvania, right off Route 422, northwest of Philadelphia. The Phoenixville Brewhouse & Eatery moved \\"across the street\\" from the original location in 2010 which provided more space, parking and room for the annual Bock Fest and Goat Race. Beer production capacity tripled in 2012 with the opening of the new brewery in Pottstown. The 30,000 sq. ft. brewery, situated on six acres at 331 Circle of Progress in the Pottstown Airport Business Center, is able to brew 50 hectoliters three times a day. A tasting room/pub has since been added.

St. Patrick's Day Boot Camp Dreamed up in 2003 by Corey Reid, the Phoenixville location's bar manager, the St. Patrick's Day Boot Camp is a nine- or ten-week program leading up to St. Patrick's Day that allows participants to earn raffle tickets for a drawing conducted on St. Patrick's Day. Starting in 2005, the grand prize is a trip for two to Ireland. Each visit to Sly Fox earns the participant two raffle tickets and a stamp on their Boot Camp card, and participants can visit both locations. Starting in 2005, raffle tickets are given out on Wednesdays in Phoenixville and Thursdays in Royersford. After eight stamps, participants are given a Boot Camp T-shirt and ten additional raffle tickets. Robbie Burns Birthday Bash Sly Fox's Robbie Burns Birthday Bash, held in January at Phoenixville every year since 2003, honors Scotland's greatest poet. The event marks the release of Gang Aft Agley Scotch Ale and Burns' Scottish Ale and features readings of Burns' poetry by attendees, bagpipes, and a menu of Haggis and other Scottish treats. Bock Beer Festival and Goat Race Goat race held May 2006 An all-day event held annually in Pottstown, typically on the first Sunday in May, the Bock Beer Festival and Goat Race celebrates Bock-style beers and a traditional German menu. Originally the brain child of brewers David Sutula and Brian O'Reilly and launched in 1997 at the John Harvard's Brew House in Cleveland, Ohio. O'Reilly brought the idea with him to Sly Fox in 2002 after the Cleveland brewery closed. The event is held inside the pub and on the outside patio and parking area. The event also features a multi-heat goat race competition in the adjacent parking lot. Owners run with the leashed animals but may not lead or pull them toward the finish line. The victorious goat earns the reward of having the brewery's annual Maibock named in its honor. The 2005 event was greeted by sunshine, clear skies and spring temperatures, after a number of weeks where the area saw inclement weather. The good weather brought out an unexpected, record crowd of 1,000-plus people, a record 24 goats in the race, and the pub poured 13 barrels (403 gallons) of beer, putting a strain on the staff, supply of glasses, and restroom facilities. After learning some lessons in 2005, the festival in 2006 was greeted again by bright, warm sunshine and went smoother despite seeing nearly double the crowd from the previous year.

Post-race video review revealed that the final was actually won by non-profit animal rescue Recycled Tails' entrant \\"Jixxer\\". Sly Fox released a statement apologizing for the error and announcing a special event and a beer named after Jixxer as restitution. IPA Project Started in 2004 as a year-long celebration of brewery's ninth year in business, Sly Fox created a series of eight varietal IPAs, each brewed with a single hop. All eight of the hops were used to brew Odyssey, Sly Fox's first Imperial IPA. The event culminated in an all-day festival at the Phoenixville location in December where the brewery's flagship Rt. 113 IPA, all eight varietal IPAs, and Odyssey were all available on tap. In 2005, the IPA Project was repeated with nine varietal IPAs with nine new hops plus a reformulated Odyssey. The IPA Project celebration poured 12 different IPAs: Rt. 113 IPA, the nine varietals, and both the 2004 and 2005 Odyssey. The day-long event also marked the release of Rt. 113 IPA in 22oz bottles. IPA Project 2006 repeated the best three single hop IPAs each from 2004 and 2005 and introduced four new ones, for a total of ten varietals. This year's day-long celebration in December was topped off with the first release of Odyssey Imperial IPA in 22oz bottles. The 2007 version was hindered by a massive warehouse fire that occurred in October in Yakima, Washington, which destroyed roughly two million pounds of U.S. grown hops and has left several varieties in short supply or completely sold out for the year, but Brewery Operations Manager Tim Ohst announced that they planned on brewing eleven total varietals but in smaller batches.

Ron Wynn notes that Napoleon \\"was a competent, though unimaginative trumpeter whose greatest value was the many recording sessions he led that helped increase jazz's popularity in the mid-'20s.\\" Richard Cook and Brian Morton, writing for The Penguin Guide to Jazz, refer to Napoleon as \\"a genuine pioneer\\" whose playing was \\"profoundly influential on men such as Red Nichols and Bix Beiderbecke.\\" Napoleon began with classical training, and was performing publicly by age 5. In the 1910s, he was one of the first musicians in the northeastern United States to embrace the new \\"jass\\" style brought to that part of the country by musicians from New Orleans, Louisiana. With pianist Frank Signorelli he formed the group \\"The Original Memphis Five\\" in 1917. He became one of the most sought after trumpeters of the 1920s. The group were very prolific, one of the most prolific in New York City at the time, and in 1922-1923 alone made over a hundred recordings. Napoleon's 1927 version of \\"Clarinet Marmalade\\" was a particular success. The Original Memphis Five split in 1928. During the 1930s Napoleon mainly worked as a session trumpeter, working in the RCA Radio Orchestra in the early 1930s, and in 1937 unsuccessfully tried to form his own orchestra. He recorded with the Cotton Pickers and the Charleston Chasers and also worked with blues singers Leona Williams and Alberta Hunter. Napoleon joined Jimmy Dorsey's then Los Angeles- based group in the mid 1940s, and he appeared with the band in the film Four Jills in a Jeep. Parting with Dorsey in 1947, he moved back to New York and worked as a studio musician at NBC until 1949-1950 when he reformed The Original Memphis Five. During the early 1950s the group became noted for their performances at Nick's in New York City. Phil also worked frequently with his nephew Marty Napoleon, a jazz pianist. On July 3, 1959, Napoleon and The Five performed at the Newport Jazz Festival, later released as an album. In 1966 opened up his own club named \\"Napoleon's Retreat\\" in Miami, Florida where he lived until his death, although continued to perform Dixieland jazz in the club up until the 1980s.

However, some of these gu·π≠hƒ´s still exist with its own purpose, and their functions governed by the internal unwritten rules; often kept secret and revealed only to its members. During the course of time, the male family members (often the bloodline) of pre-existing members are handed out the responsibilities associated with the gu·π≠hƒ´. The \\"Guthi Bill\\", tabled in the Upper House of the Federal Parliament of Nepal in April 2019, was highly controversial and prompted a number of mass protests against the bill, especially in the Kathmandu Valley. Guthi came to being after the realisation of people of working together, esuring their lives and working together for same objective. The member of Guthi are called Guthiyars. There are three type of guthi.  Organizational structure  Guthi is traditionally a patriarchal kinship based on certain norms that are moderated by the gu·π≠hƒ´ system. It consists of a thakali or the eldest person of the gu·π≠hƒ´. The consent of the thakali is essential for the formulation of most of the norms of the gu·π≠hƒ´. Guthi is a form of institutional landownership, the religious and charitable aspects of which have given rise to special problems and characteristics in the fields of land tenure and taxation.  Role in society  Guthi have played an important role in maintaining harmony in the Newar society. The Guthi is a system that has been part of the Newa social system in the Kathmandu Valley since the 5th century BC. The Guthi system is a trust, whereby land is donated to this trust. This land is then tilled upon by members of the local community and the revenue generated is not only a source of economy for the community but is also utilized to undertake various works within the community such as restoration of temples, patis (rest houses), maths (priest houses), dhunge dharas (stone water spouts) and so on. This revenue is also used to carry out various festivals, customs, rites and rituals. It was a system, therefore, that engaged the local community in terms of not only tilling the land but also engaging a group of people such as masons, shilpakars (the group of people who work with wood) and helping them to develop their skill. It also benefitted the local community economically through the revenue generated and also provided a framework within which the local community could protect their tangible and intangible culture, enabling them to protect their very identity. Donation of land to the Guthi is considered to be a very good deed and is believed to have religious merits according to Nepalese culture. Historically, kings and the royals as well as local people would donate land to the Guthi with the belief that it would bring spiritual deliverance for seven generations. Donation of land to the Guthi was also a symbol of status in society and was highly regarded. Furthermore, another reason for endowment was to prevent the State to confiscate property as it was considered a great crime to confiscate Guthi land. All these reasons helped in the pooling of land within these Guthi which was then used as a base on which regular income could be generated and to undertake various activities. The Guthi system was basically associations formed by groups of people based often on various castes, which were in turn formed in the past based on occupations. Guthis existed for the Gods, the living and the dead and all activities concerning these three themes were carried out by the members of the Guthis. Although most of the Guthi system is now slowly becoming lost due to changes in the social structure of communities and more so due to significant changes in the past fifty years such as the nationalization of the Guthi System and land reform campaigns, most Guthis do still exist although the activities that they conduct may have diminished considerably. The Guthi system is therefore integrated into the social structure of the communities and hence was not only successful but also highly sustainable. It is a system like no other in the world and can be highlighted as a model of a system that worked not only to preserve tangible but also intangible aspects of culture within the Kathmandu Valley.

Adapted from the novel The Grizzly King (1916) by American author James Oliver Curwood, the screenplay was written by G√©rard Brach. Set in British Columbia, Canada, the film tells the story of an orphan bear cub who befriends an adult male grizzly as two trophy hunters pursue them through the wild. Several of the themes explored in the story include orphanhood, peril and protection, and mercy toward and on the behalf of a reformed hunter. Annaud and Brach began planning the story and production in 1981, although filming did not begin until six years later, due to the director's commitment to another project. The Bear was filmed almost entirely in the Italian and Austrian areas of the Dolomites, with live animals‚Äîincluding Bart the Bear, a trained 9-foot tall Kodiak bear‚Äîpresent on location. Notable for its almost complete lack of dialogue and its minimal score, the film was nominated for and won numerous international film awards. Plot In 1885, in the mountainous wilds of British Columbia, Canada, a grizzly bear cub is orphaned by the death of his mother from a rockslide while digging and searching for honey. Forced to fend for himself, the cub struggles to find food and shelter. Elsewhere in the mountains, a large male grizzly is being pursued and hunted by two trophy hunters, Tom and Bill. Although Tom attempts to kill the grizzly, his shot only injures the bear in the shoulder and thus fails to take the animal down while the wounded bear flees. Coming across the grizzly a short time later, the cub notices his wound and attempts to befriend him, but the grizzly gives him a warning growl since he doesn't need help and is not at all interested in him. The cub, however, follows the grizzly and approaches him again, managing to soothe his wound by licking it. A friendship begins between the two bears as the grizzly becomes the cub's adoptive father and takes him under his wing, teaching the cub how to catch salmon and hunt animals. At night, the cub suffers from nightmares, reliving the tragic death of his mother. Determined to find the grizzly, the two hunters are joined by a third man and his pack of hunting Beaucerons. A chase ensues in which both bears are driven toward a cliff with the dog pack catching up to them in pursuit. While the cub hides, the grizzly violently fights the dog pack while defending the cub and kills some of them before escaping over the pass with the remaining dogs chasing after him, leaving the cub behind. The hunters arrive to find their dogs dead or wounded, one of them being Tom‚Äôs pet Airedale Terrier. Upon finding the cub, they take him to their camp, where he is tethered to a tree and tormented by the hunters and their dogs. That night, the hunters plot how to massacre the grizzly. The next day, the hunters separate, with Tom manning a spot high on a cliff near a waterfall. He descends from his post to wash up in a small waterfall in the hills. His gun out of reach, Tom suddenly finds himself confronted by the grizzly, who viciously growls at the sight of the man upon recognizing him as the one who shot him earlier. Faced with certain death, Tom cowers in fear. However, the grizzly, upon seeing that the hunter is at his mercy and thinking he has forgiven him, instead spares his life rather than killing Tom and leaves. Tom, impressed by the bear's act of mercy, attempts to scare him off more quickly by shooting his gun in the air. When Bill joins him, having heard the gunshots, Tom lies to him that the bear is dead. However, spying the grizzly ascending a scree, Bill raises his rifle to shoot, only to be stopped by Tom, who insists that they let the animal go instead. The three hunters return to their camp empty-handed, where they free the cub and then ride off into the wilderness. Alone again, the cub is soon attacked by a cougar, who corners the young bear near a stream. Trying to defend himself against the cougar's attacks and getting injured, the cub, in pain, growls for help. At that moment, the grizzly appears behind the cub and saves his life by letting out a loud roar that chases the cougar away. The cub happily reunites with the grizzly and runs to his side, where he is comforted before being taken under his wing again. As winter approaches, the two bears enter a cave for hibernation and fall asleep together. Cast * Bart the Bear as The Kodiak Bear * Youk the Bear as The Bear Cub * Tch√©ky Karyo as Tom * Jack Wallace as Bill * Andre Lacombe as The dog hunter Production Sources Frontispiece of James Oliver Curwood's The Grizzly King (1916) American author James Oliver Curwood's novella The Grizzly King was published in 1916. The story was based on several trips he took to British Columbia, and the young hunter, called Jim in the book, is based on Curwood himself.Eldridge, p. 7 However, many of its plot elements‚Äîmainly dealing with the friendship between the bear cub and the adult male grizzly‚Äîwere fabricated. Curwood's biographer, Judith A. Eldridge, believes that the incident in which the hunter is spared by a bear is based on truth, a fact that was later related to Jean-Jacques Annaud. He stated during an interview that he \\"was given a letter from Curwood's granddaughter revealing that what happened in the story happened to him. He was hunting bear, as he had done often, and lost his rifle down a cliff. Suddenly, a huge bear confronted him and menaced him, but for reasons Curwood could never know, spared his life.\\"Mahar, p. E01 Shortly after the book's publication, Curwood‚Äîonce an adamant hunter‚Äîbecame a supporter of wildlife conservation.Eldridge, pp. 7‚Äì8 Brach and Annaud decided to set the film in the late 19th century to create a perception of true wilderness, especially for the human characters.Thompson, p. 2 In addition, while both the bears and the two hunters are named in the script, their names are not mentioned in the film. The bear cub is referred to in the script as Youk, and the adult male grizzly is known as Kaar. Tch√©ky Karyo's character is said to have been called Tom and Jack Wallace's is Bill. These names differ from Curwood's novel; for example, the cub is known as Muskwa in the novel, and his adult companion is called Thor. Development After the commercial success of Jean-Jacques Annaud's previous films, including the Academy Award-winning Black and White in Color (1976) and Quest for Fire (1981), producer Claude Berri offered to produce Annaud's next project, no matter the cost.Benabent- Loiseau, p. 7 The French filmmaker had first considered the idea of making a film that included mammal communication through behavior, rather than language, while working on Quest for Fire. He became particularly interested in making an animal \\"the star of a psychological drama\\", so he \\"decided to do an entertaining, commercial adventure and psychological film\\" that would have an animal hero.Nichols, p. 23 He discussed this idea with his longtime collaborator, screenwriter Gerard Brach, who within a few days sent Annaud a copy of The Grizzly King, to which the filmmaker quickly agreed.Benabent- Loiseau, p. 8 Although Brach began writing the screenplay in late 1981, Annaud took on another project, that of directing a film adaptation of Umberto Eco's book The Name of the Rose. Between preparing for and filming his next film, Annaud traveled and visited zoos in order to research animal behavior. In an interview he later gave with the American Humane Association, Annaud stated: \\"Each time I was fascinated with the tigers, to a point that I thought to do a movie called The Tiger instead of The Bear. In those days I felt that the bear, because they're so often vertical, would give me a better identification, or would provide more instant identification from the viewers.\\"Milosevic, Yvonne. \\"Film & TV Unit Profiles: Jean-Jacques Annaud\\". American Humane Association. Retrieved on 6 June 2012. The finished script was presented to Berri in early 1983.Benabent-Loiseau, pp. 11-12 Filming Saslonch, a mountain in the Dolomites in South Tyrol, Italy Shot from 13 May to late October 1987, The Bear was filmed almost entirely in the Italian and Austrian areas of the Dolomites. Several additional scenes were also filmed in a Belgian Zoo in early 1988.L√ºdi, p. 72 The crew consisted of 200 individuals. Husband and wife team Tony and Heidi L√ºdi served as the film's production designer and art director, respectively, alongside set decorator Bernhard Henrich. In their book, Movie Worlds: Production Design in Film, the L√ºdis state that as the film's production designers, they \\"were constantly faced with the question 'What did you have to do?' To which we answered 'We turned the Alps into British Columbia.'\\" Cinematographer Philippe Rousselot noted that \\"the only thing Jean-Jacques was unable to control\\" while filming in the Bavarian Alps \\"was the weather: he did not manage to have the clouds take part in pre-production meetings.\\"Baron, p. E1 While animatronic bears were used for several of the fighting scenes, live animalsincluding bears, dogs, horses, and honey beeswere used on location for filming.Nichols, p. 26 A trained, 9-foot tall Kodiak bear named Bart played the adult grizzly, while a young female bear named Douce (\\"Sweetness\\" in English) took on the role of the cub, with several alternates. Three trainers worked with Bart (including his owner Doug Seus), eleven with the cubs, three with the dogs, and three with the horses. One day during production, Bart injured Annaud while the two posed for photographers; Annaud's wounds, which included claw-marks on his backside, had to be drained with a shunt for two months.Schickel, p. 97 In addition to the real bears, there were animatronic bears which were used in specific scenes that were made by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Themes With its intersecting storylines of animals and humans, The Bear includes a variety of thematic elements. These themes include orphanhood, peril and protection, and mercy toward and on the behalf of a reformed hunter. Film critic Derek Bous√© has made the connection between The Bear and Disney's model of wildlife films, comparing not only the sympathetic characters but also the filmatic structure, to the animated Bambi (1942) and the live-action Perri (1957).Bous√© (1990), p. 31 In his 2000 book Wildlife Films, Bous√© makes a stronger correlation between Annaud's film and Disney's Dumbo (1941), in that both young animals lost their mothers at an early age, creating an unfortunate situation that allows the rest of the plot to develop (although, Dumbo's mother was merely imprisoned for a while, and was re-united with her son at the film's end).Bous√© (2000), p. 138 Dumbo and The Bear also share a similarly purposed dream sequence, brought on by alcohol in the former and hallucinogenic mushrooms in the latter. The theme of the reformed hunter is a direct reference to the original novel and its author. James Oliver Curwood, himself a past hunter and trapper, considered The Grizzly King to be a \\"confession of one who for years hunted and killed before he learned that the wild offered a more thrilling sport than slaughter\\".Curwood, p. vii During its American release, the film used one of Curwood's famous quotes as a tagline\\"The greatest thrill is not to kill but to let live\\"and the film was endorsed by both the American Humane Association and the World Wildlife Fund.Wilson, p. 154 Release The Bear was released on 19 October 1988 in France, and 27 October 1989 in the United States. An official tie-in to the movie The Odyssey of 'The Bear': The Making of the Film by Jean-Jacques Annaud, a translation from the French edition, followed in November. In addition, Curwood's original novelout of print in the US for fifty yearswas republished by Newmarket Press, and a children's book titled The Bear Storybook was published by St. Martin's Press.McDowell, Edwin.

Some critics pointed to The Bear's adult handling of the wildlife film genre, which is often dismissed as belonging solely to children's films.Bous√© (1990), p. 30 While positively reviewing the film, critic Roger Ebert wrote that The Bear \\"is not a cute fantasy in which bears ride tricycles and play house. It is about life in the wild, and it does an impressive job of seeming to show wild bears in their natural habitat\\" and that scenes from the film, especially those \\"of horseplay and genuine struggles - gradually build up our sense of the personalities of these animals\\".Ebert, Roger.

Janet Maslin of The New York Times, however, believing that the film was less about its wild characters and more about personification, wrote: \\"The Bear...is a remarkable achievement only on its own terms, which happen to be extremely limited and peculiar...its true emphasis is not on wildlife. Instead, it grafts the thoughts and dreams of more commonplace beings onto bear-shaped stand-ins.\\"Maslin, Janet.

Writing for the hunting and fishing magazine Field & Stream, editor Cathleen Erring stated that The Bear not only stripped its human characters of \\"all sympathetic traits and [gave] them to the bears\\", but it also created \\"a caricature that will subject anyone embarking on a bear hunt ... to the kind of scorn previously reserved for 'Bambi Butchers'.\\"Errig, p. 172 Some reviewers were critical of the film's dream sequences, which heavily utilize special effects and deviate from the overall naturalistic feel of the film. In his review for the St. Petersburg Times, Hal Lipper called the dream sequences \\"existential flights of fancy are accompanied by psychedelic images that seem better suited for '60s 'happenings.'\\"Lipper, p. 13 In addition, one scene in which the male grizzly mates with a female bear while the cub looks on was criticized as being unfriendly for children viewers. David Denby of New York Magazine stated as much in his review of the film, noting \\"I would like to be able to recommend The Bear as a movie that parents and children could see together, but I'm afraid there's a scene in the middle that would have to be... explained.\\"Denby, p. 70 A small campaign was launched for the 61st Academy Awards to get Bart a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor, with defenders arguing the bear gave such a moving performance he should be the first animal actor to receive a mention in that category. However, the campaign was squashed by the Academy, who said they would not permit non-human actors to be nominated.White, Adam.

Others were issued by his brother Epaticcus. Coins of the Corieltauvi were also part of the hoard. In addition to the coins, an iron finger ring, almost certainly of Roman provenance, was also found. The ring contains a gemstone bearing the figure of a man. The exact means of how this came to be a part of the hoard are still subject to debate.

Besides Dussehri, other varieties of mangoes such as Chausa, Fazli, Lucknowa, Jauhari, Safeda, etc. are also grown here. History \\"According to tradition, the town was founded by Malia a Pasi; but nothing is known of its history till the reign of Akbar, when it was inhabited by Pathans. The place is said to have been founded by one malia, a pasi, but nothing is known of this person, although is appears that the Pasis and Arakhs held sway over this and the surrounding villages form the earliest time. It is also said that the Pasis has mint here and the their coins have sometimes been found, from which the town gained its name of Khonta Shahr or the city of the bad money. Nothing definite, however, is known of the place till the time of Akbar, when it was colonized by the Pathans. The date of the Muslman occupation in uncertain, but it has been suggested that is occurred as oarly as the time of Muhammad Bakhtiya Khilji, who invaded Oudh in 1202. Prior to the time of Shuja-ud-daula it seems that the principal sites were bakhtiyarnagar and Garhi Sanjar Khan. During his reign the Pathan proprietors granted as portion of malihabad, known as the Kenwal-har, to Faqir Muhammad Khan, as Afridi Pathan of Rohilkhand. The bazar Mirzaganj was built by Mirza Hasan Beg But before this the old bazar is found in Village Garhi sanjar khan, as official of the Oudh Government. The other bazar of Amaniganj beyond the railway station owes its origin to Asaf-ud- daula, who built the place on his way to fight with the Rohillas.\\"It is said to have been the chief seat of the Arakhs or Pasis, and to have been founded by Malia Pasi, whose brother Salia founded Sandila in Hardoi. Even under the- rule of this tribe it must have been a place of considerable importance.

A Few Rare Varieties: Munzar Aamin: The variety is generally produced by the end of the season and appears almost round in size instead of the regular shape of a mango. It can be relished both by sipping the juice and by cutting it into slices and chomping the thick pulpy fruit. Nazeer Pasand: These varieties of mangoes are not at all fibril and can be found by the time of the season when Dashehari starts disappearing from the market. Japani Lakhnaua: The variety representing the blend of two countries and unity among them is named after the shape of the tree and its bracts.

Kaccha Meetha: This unique variety of mangoes are rare to find and are known for their sweet taste even when they are raw and ripe. Paan: As the name suggests the fruit is in shape of a ‚Äòpaan‚Äô with mushy yellow pulp. As compared to the look it weighs heavier and each fruit is of approximately half a kg.

To get these, you have to wait until end of July when they are at their best to be pickled. Kala Pahad: Abhorrent in looks, this variety of mangoes tastes in three different flavors at the same time which disparate it among all other varieties of mangoes.

It is also a tehsil seat for surrounding 64 villages. History Prince Mohammad Malik Khan founded the town of Malkapur around the 13th century, and named it after his daughter, Princess Malika. He built the six gates like a fort. Their names are Mangal Darwaza, Mughal Darwaza, Bada Darwaza, and the remaining three have fallen down. The town gained its independence from the Bahamani Sultanate in 1399. Malkapur is mentioned in Ain-i-Akbari as the headquarters of a paragana in the sarkar of Narnala. However, the story is improbable as no known record exists of any journey in this direction by Miran Ghani Adil Khan, a Faruqi prince of the period. 1761, the town was rich enough to pay Rs. 60,000 to the army of Raghunathrao, who later became a ruling Peshwa from 1773‚Äì74, for exemption from plunder. The Nizams used to keep a force of about 20,000 men in this frontier district of their dominions. Daulatrav Shinde and Raghuji Bhosle were encamped near Malkapur when the British envoy Colonel Collins, after presenting General Lord Wellesley's ultimatum, quit Shinde's camp in 1803. Demographics According to the 2018 census, Malkapur has a population of 278,794. Males constitute 51% of the population and females 49%. Malkapur has an average literacy rate of 82%, higher than the national average of 75%. The male literacy is 89% and female literacy is 75%. In Malkapur, 20% of the population is under 6 years of age. Transport Malkapur is located on the Hajira - Kolkata National Highway 6, which is a part of the Asian Highway 46 from Kharagpur to Dhule.Malkapur railway station lies on the Howrah-Nagpur-Mumbai line. Malkapur bus station is on Buldhana road. A boat facility is also available at Nalganga river.

It is globally recognized as a geologically important location due to the presence of the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) marking the boundary between Silurian and Devonian periods. The boundary was set based on the first appearance of the graptolite Monograptus uniformis in the bed number 20. The stratotype was ratified on the 8th of February 1972 by the International Union of Geological Sciences in Montreal as the first formally accepted GSSP.  History  Monument inscription at Klonk The positioning of the boundary between Silurian and Devonian has been a matter of discussion since the 19th century. The so-called hercynian question was resolved only after the ratification of the GSSP in 1972. Ever since then, Klonk is one of the most popular stratigraphic profiles in the world. The monument was declared as a protected area in 1977.  Geology  Klonk is a rocky slope by the right bank of Suchomastsk√Ω brook. It contains two formations of upper Silurian (Kopanina formation, Po≈æ√°ry formation) and one formation of lower Devonian (Lochkov formation named for the nearby 'Lochkov profile'). Kopanina formation is represented by calcareous shales, Po≈æ√°ry formation by gray tabular limestones and bioclastic limestones can be found in Lochkov formation. The boundary beds are intact, without disturbance by tectonic processes, there are no facial changes and the profile is made of one continuous sequence. There are various paleontologically significant objects, apart from the already mentioned graptolites it is possible to find the trilobite Warburgella rugulosa typical for the base of Devonian period, the conodont Icriodus wolschmidti and the chitinozoan Agnochitina chlupaci. Various other invertebrates can be found in the profile, such as bivalves, gastropods, crustaceans and brachiopods. Apart from animals, remains of terrestrial flora can also be found in the beds, namely the genus Cooksonia. Soils are rather undeveloped, only close above the brook in the lower part of the slope clayey screes can be found. There is a unique monument representing the geological boundary set by international agreement. It was built in 1977 by academic sculptor Ji≈ô√≠ Novotn√Ω. Flora and fauna Geological profile with highlighted bed no. 20 Various plant communities can be found at Klonk. The vicinity of the brook is characterized by human planted vegetation, for example the common alder (Alnus glutinosa), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) or Canadian poplar (Populus x canadensis), in the lower parts of the slope are the remains of scree forests with dominant sycamore. Shady limestones by the brook are a favourable location for a number of rare bryophytes, such as the craven featherwort (Pedinophyllum interruptum) or beech feather-moss (Eurhynchium crassinervum). Most of the slope is covered by vegetation which is not native to the location ‚Äì black pine (Pinus nigra), European larch (Larix decidua), black locust (Robinia pseudoaccacia) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). The original community of oak-hornbeam forests (Sessile oak (Quercus petraea), common hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), field maple (Acer campestre)) can only be found in the upper parts of the profile. The formerly woodless areas tend to be covered by bushes of dog-rose (Rosa canina), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) and common dogwood (Cornus sanguinea), atop the hill we may find an area of xerothermic grasslands such as spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) and hairy oxytropis (Oxytropis pilosa). Klonk is the nesting place for a number of birds, among others the grey wagtail (Motacilla cinerea), Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipited nisus) or the common buzzard (Buteo buteo). Most of the fauna here is represented by invertebrates, however apart from other areas of the Bohemian karst it is somewhat poorer in molluscs. Vertebrate fauna is represented by red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European badger (Meles meles), wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) and other, usually common species.  Protection plan  Information board of the educational trail The goal of the protection plan is to secure the important geological profile and preserve it for future study. Klonk is mainly threatened by amateur palaeontologists who expect a rich locality, however the location is important mainly due to microfossils. Another threat is the overgrowing of vegetation, which has been successfully removed mechanically and by herbicides in the past. The removal of unwanted vegetation should also help the return of the original vegetation, which used to be strongly influenced by pasture. Plans for the future include marking of borders of the protected area in order to facilitate management, since it lies on parts of two private properties. The profile is currently closed to the public not only to protect it, but also to avoid injuries of visitors on the steep slope.  Educational trail  The location is a part of 39 kilometers long geological educational trail, which also leads through adjacent areas of importance such as Lom na Kobyle, Zlat√Ω k≈Ø≈à, Koda and others. Individual localities aren‚Äôt necessarily related and it is thus possible to travel only through certain segments of the trail. The trail is suitable even for cyclists and the information boards are in Czech with English abstract.

It is found in the bark of several species of plants, principally the white birch (Betula pubescens) from which it gets its name, but also the ber tree (Ziziphus mauritiana), selfheal (Prunella vulgaris), the tropical carnivorous plants Triphyophyllum peltatum and Ancistrocladus heyneanus, Diospyros leucomelas, a member of the persimmon family, Tetracera boiviniana, the jambul (Syzygium formosanum), flowering quince (Pseudocydonia sinensis, former Chaenomeles sinensis KOEHNE), (Chaenomeles sinensis KOEHNE is now named Pseudocydonia sinensis) rosemary, and Pulsatilla chinensis. Antitumor activity In 1995, betulinic acid was reported as a selective inhibitor of human melanoma. Then it was demonstrated to induce apoptosis in human neuroblastoma in vitro and in vivo in model systems. At one time, it was undergoing drug development with assistance from the Rapid Access to Intervention Development program of the National Cancer Institute. Also, betulinic acid was found active in vitro against neuroectodermal (neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma) and malignant brain tumors, ovarian carcinoma, in human leukemia HL-60 cells, and malignant head and neck squamous cell carcinoma SCC25 and SCC9 cell lines. In contrast, epithelial tumors, such as breast, colon, small cell lung and renal cell carcinomas, as well as T-cell leukemia cells, were completely unresponsive to treatment with betulinic acid. The effects of betulinic acid as an anticancer agent in breast cancer is found to be cannabinoid receptor dependent. Betulinic acid behave as an CB1 antagonist and CB2 agonist. Mode of action Regarding the mode of action of betulinic acid, little is known about its antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing mechanisms. In neuroectodermal tumor cells, betulinic acid‚Äìinduced apoptosis is accompanied by caspase activation, mitochondrial membrane alterations and DNA fragmentation. Caspases are produced as inactive proenzymes, which are proteolytically processed to their active forms. These proteases can cooperate in proteolytic cascades, in which caspases activate themselves and each other. The initiation of the caspases cascade may lead to the activation of endonucleases such as caspase-activated DNAase (CAD). After activation, CAD contributes to DNA degradation. Betulinic acid induces apoptosis by direct effects on mitochondria, leading to cytochrome-C release, which in turn regulates the \\"downstream\\" caspase activation. Betulinic acid bypasses resistance to CD95 and doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis, due to different molecular mechanism of betulinic acid-induced apoptosis. The role of p53 in betulinic acid-induced apoptosis is controversial. Fulda suggested a p53-independent mechanism of the apoptosis, based on no accumulation of wild- type p53 detected upon treatment with the betulinic acid, whereas wild-type p53 protein strongly increased after treatment with doxorubicin. The suggestion is supported by study of Raisova. Alternatively, Rieber suggested betulinic acid exerts its inhibitory effect on human metastatic melanoma partly by increasing p53. The study also demonstrated preferential apoptotic effect of betulinic acid on C8161 metastatic melanoma cells, with greater DNA fragmentation and growth arrest and earlier loss of viability than their nonmetastatic C8161/neo 6.3 counterpart. Comparing betulinic acid with other treatment modes, Zuco demonstrated it was less than 10% as potent as doxorubicin and showed an in vitro antiproliferative activity against melanoma and nonmelanoma cell lines, including those resistant to doxorubicin. On the human normal dermatoblast cell line, betulinic acid was one-half to one-fifth as toxic as doxorubicin. The ability of betulinic acid to induce two different effects (cytotoxic and cytostatic) on two clones derived from the same human melanoma metastasis suggests the development of clones resistant to this agent will be more unlikely, than that to conventional cytotoxic drugs. Moreover, in spite of the lower potency compared with doxorubicin, betulinic acid seems to be selective for tumor cells with minimal toxicity against normal cells. The effect of betulinic acid on melanoma cell lines is stronger than its growth- inhibitory effect on primary melanocytes. A study of a combination of betulinic acid with Œ≥-irradiation showed clearly additive effects, and indicated they differ in their modes of action. C-3 esterification of betulinic acid led to the discovery of bevirimat, an HIV-1 maturation inhibitor patented by Rhone-Poulenc (now Sanofi-Aventis). The clinical development, however, was stopped due to poor pharmacodynamic properties.Novel 3,28-Disubstituted Betulinic Acid Derivatives as Potent Anti-HIV Agents Aims/Hypothesis Out-licensing. iptechex pharmalicensing, IP Technology Exchange (2013) Biosynthesis Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been engineered to produce betulinic acid from the mevalonate pathway, with squalene 2,3-epoxide as an intermediate. Acetyl-CoA is converted to squalene through use of the 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) and the bifunctional farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase and squalene synthase (ERG9) and oxidation of NADPH to NADP+. This is then further oxygenated by the squalene monooxygenase (ERG1) to squalene 2,3-epoxide. This is cyclized to lupeol by the Arabidopsis thaliana lupeol synthase (AtLUP1). Finally, lupeol is converted to betulinic acid through the Catharanthus roseus P450 monooxygenase (CrAO) with the oxidation of NADPH to NADP+. Biosynthetic pathway of betulinic acid, with all of the enzymes, structures, and cofactors as described by Li et. al in \\"Modulating betulinic acid production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by managing the intracellular supplies of the co- factor NADPH and oxygen\\". Anticancer derivatives A major inconvenience for the future clinical development of betulinic acid and analogues resides in their poor solubility in aqueous media such as blood serum and polar solvents used for bioassays. To circumvent this problem of hydrosolubility and to enhance pharmacological properties, many derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for cytotoxic activity. One study showed C-20 modifications involve the loss of cytotoxicity. Another study demonstrated the importance of the presence of the -COOH group, since compounds substituted at this position, such as lupeol and methyl betulinate, were less active on human melanoma than betulinic acid. Moreover, some C-28 amino acids and C-3 phthalates derivatives exhibited higher cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines with improved selective toxicity and water solubility. Chatterjee et al. obtained the 28-O-Œ≤-D-glucopyranoside of betulinic acid by microbial transformation with Cunninghamella species, while Baglin et al. obtained it by organic synthesis. This glucoside did not exhibit any significant in vitro activity on human melanoma (MEL-2) and human colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT-29) cell lines, which confirms the importance of the carboxylic acid function to preserve the cytotoxicity. Recently, Gauthier et al. synthesized a series of 3-O-glycosides of betulinic acid which exhibited a strongly potent in vitro anticancer activity against human cancer cell lines.

This session proved to be a turning point in Serbian politics, as it marked the rise of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá as a key force in Serbian politics. Background The 8th Session of the League of Communists of Serbia (League of Communists of Yugoslavia's Serbian branch) took place against the backdrop of rising ethnic tensions between the Albanian and Serb communities in the Serbian province of Kosovo. General anti-Albanian feeling throughout Serbia was also high following the deadly crime in the dormitory of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) barracks in Paraƒáin on 3 September 1987. Known as the Paraƒáin massacre, it was committed by the 19-year-old ethnic Albanian recruit Aziz Kelmendi who randomly opened fire on his fellow soldiers, killing four of them and wounding further five. Ivan Stamboliƒá was then the President of Serbia. His support a year earlier had helped Milo≈°eviƒá become the chief of Serbian Communist Party, but he was becoming more and more opposed to Milo≈°eviƒá. This was due to the latter's policy about dealing with Albanian unrest in Kosovo, which demanded rapid action instead of reaching a consensus through slow and patient negotiations with the Albanian leaders - a plan supported by Stamboliƒá and his ally Dragi≈°a Pavloviƒá, leader of the Belgrade Communist Party. Stamboliƒá was also unimpressed by Milo≈°eviƒá's handling of a crowd in Kosovo, when he used the phrase \\"no one shall beat you again\\" that has since then become famous and also displayed open support for the Kosovo Serbs, against the party policy. This situation was worsened by Milo≈°eviƒá's grudge against Pavloviƒá, who highly disapproved of the Milo≈°eviƒá camp and who had been appointed as the leader of the Belgrade Communist Party by Stamboliƒá against the wishes of Milo≈°eviƒá. Together, these factors ensured that the stage was set for a showdown between the two. Days preceding the session Milo≈°eviƒá's handling of the Kosovo situation split the Serbian Communist Party into two groups. Pro-Pavloviƒá/Stamboliƒá group favoured negotiations with the Albanian leaders while the pro-Milo≈°eviƒá group demanded quick and rapid action to end the \\"Kosovo problem\\". Pavloviƒá's thinly veiled critical comments, accused Milo≈°eviƒá of being an anti-Albanian Serb nationalist who's offering populist solutions to the Kosovo situation. Seeing the remarks as an attack, Milo≈°eviƒá, together with his senior allies within the party, planned to expel Pavloviƒá from the Communist Party. Pavloviƒá, however, enjoyed the staunch support of Stamboliƒá, the party's influential leader. Pavloviƒá's expulsion from the party would effectively mean toppling Stamboliƒá. Stamboliƒá dispatched a letter to Pavloviƒá asking the members of the party's Belgrade branch to stay out of it if the question was raised about Pavloviƒá. This was a huge mistake as later this letter would cost Stamboliƒá dearly. Also this letter raised many eyebrows among the Belgrade Party itself, who thought of this letter as unnecessary pressure by Stamboliƒá. Milo≈°eviƒá's supporters among the members of the Belgrade Communist Party, led by Du≈°an Miteviƒá, were particularly angry at this. On 18 September the Presidency of the Serbian Communist Party met. Stamboliƒá tried hard to forge a compromise between the two groups, but now Milo≈°eviƒá officially turned against Stamboliƒá by calling Pavloviƒá a threat to \\"ideological unity\\". But Milo≈°eviƒá did not have any forces at that moment to outmanoeuvre Stamboliƒá. He was bailed out of this situation by Du≈°an Miteviƒá. Miteviƒá, along with some members of the Belgrade Communist Party, drafted a letter to Milo≈°eviƒá saying that the Belgrade Party committee had been pressurized by Stamboliƒá into supporting Pavloviƒá; they also sent Milo≈°eviƒá the original letter by Stamboliƒá. Next day, in front of about fifty members of the Communist Party, Milo≈°eviƒá read the letter aloud. Members of the party, even those who were opposed to Milo≈°eviƒá, were shocked at this revelation, even though plots were not uncommon among the party. In this case, however, Milo≈°eviƒá had a written letter which he claimed was the proof of Stamboliƒá putting personal interests ahead of those of the party. Stamboliƒá felt betrayed by the same man who was once his best friend and whose rise to the top in the Serbian Communist Party he had engineered. The day of the session Milo≈°eviƒá decided to broadcast the session live on television. Now it was an all or nothing game for Milo≈°eviƒá. If the session went the way he wanted it to go, he would be successful in expelling Pavloviƒá and toppling Stamboliƒá, leaving himself in command, but if he failed it would mean an end to his career as Stamboliƒá and his allies would crush Milo≈°eviƒá and his allies. Milo≈°eviƒá started by accusing Pavloviƒá of being against the principles of the party and those of Yugoslavia and a threat to party unity. Then Milo≈°eviƒá's allies accused Stamboliƒá for acting like a dictator by trying to shut up the Belgrade Communist Party. Stamboliƒá's letter had lost him and Pavloviƒá support among even those who were not previously allied with Milo≈°eviƒá. Stamboliƒá replied by saying that Milo≈°eviƒá was the one breaking unity. But by this time pre-arranged telegrams had started flocking in from the provinces and the Kosovo Serbs. A vote was called. Milo≈°eviƒá won and Pavloviƒá was expelled from the party. Aftermath The session ended with Milo≈°eviƒá coming out stronger than ever and Pavloviƒá expelled from the party. Pavloviƒá left politics. Stamboliƒá was publicly humiliated and weakened; even his allies lost their influence, and he was obliged to resign from the post of president of Serbia, which he did.

Based out of the northern hill country town of Oxford (home of Ole Miss), the band has been touring and recording since 1993. The Cooters are well known in the region. While recording albums, embarking on tours, and winning awards, The Cooters have also dealt with controversy, trademark lawsuits, and even prison sentences. The Cooters have released albums and records on Minneapolis, Minnesota record label Profane Existence, as well as Grammy-Nominated label T-Bones Records. The Cooters have released much of their music themselves. The Cooters are critically acclaimed, and their music has been described as a \\"mix of punk and metal with an interesting Southern flavor\\" by fans, while their lyrics tackle social and political topics, usually in a humorous tongue-in- cheek manner. The Cooters have toured across the United States, playing with bands such as Nashville Pussy, Jucifer, Blue Mountain, From Ashes Rise, Total Chaos, Bad Company, Seven Mary Three, Destroy!, Before I Hang, The Neckbones, Misery, and Wartorn. In 2006, The Cooters toured extensively with the Swedish band Imperial Leather and the Oregon band Happy Bastards, who also toured with The Cooters in 2008.

He is known for his ceramic tile mosaics modeled on the pixelated art of 1970s‚Äì1980s 8-bit video games, many of which depict the titular aliens from the 1978 arcade game Space Invaders (the inspiration for his pseudonym). His creations can be seen in highly-visible locations in over 65 cities in 33 countries. To accompany his citywide installations, or \\"Invasions\\", Invader publishes books and maps as guides to the locations of his mosaics. Invader also makes mosaics using QR codes and stacks of Rubik's Cubes (with the latter typically installed indoors). History One of Invader's aliens (MAN 47) on a wall in Manchester, England, installed in 2004 A graduate of a Parisian √âcole des Beaux-Arts, Invader initially derived inspiration for his creations from the video games he played when he was growing up in the 1970s and 80s. Using tiles to represent the pixels in the games' 8-bit graphics, Invader began making mosaics in Paris in the 1990s, and went on to install mosaics in 31 other cities in France. Invader has since staged \\"invasions\\" in cities and countries worldwide, including five in New York City and three in Hong Kong. He often installs mosaics in culturally and/or historically important locations, with one high- profile example being his December 31st, 1999 mosaic on the letter D of the Hollywood Sign marking the Y2K bug. During subsequent trips to Los Angeles, he also placed mosaics on the eight other letters of the sign. Paris remains a primary location for the artist's work; in June 2011, Invader marked the installation of his 1000th work in Paris with an exhibition at La G√©n√©rale entitled 1000. Since 2000, he has also installed more than 70 pieces of work around Hong Kong. As of January 2020, Invader had created mosaics in 79 cities, with 3858 Space Invaders comprising over 1.5 million ceramic tiles, and had published 24 \\"invasion maps.\\" In 2012, Invader made a short film Art4Space documenting his attempt to launch one of his aliens into space on a modified weather balloon. Invader also makes QR code mosaics using black and white tiles. The patterns can be easily decoded using standard QR reader smartphone apps; one such message, when decoded, reads, \\"This is an invasion.\\" Invader installations have become desirable collectors' pieces, to the point where some works have been stolen off of the walls upon which they were installed.  Identity  Invader works incognito, often masked and largely at night. To guard his anonymity on camera during interviews, he pixellates his own image or wears a mask. He claims that only a few people know his real name and his face and that his parents think he works as a tiler in the construction industry. Modus operandi Invader sees himself as a \\"hacker\\" of public space spreading a mosaic \\"virus\\". He believes that museums and galleries are not accessible to everyone, and so installs his work at street level for ordinary people to enjoy on a daily basis. The sites for his mosaics are often chosen for their visibility, local interest and symbolism. No two pieces are alike. Thomas from Kung Fu Master (HK 56) on Cannon Street, Hong Kong (2014) Although many of his works feature his signature aliens, Invader's repertoire of subjects also includes Star Wars characters, the Pink Panther, Mega Man, Spider-Man, Hong Kong Phooey, Thomas from Kung-Fu Master and Popeye. The subject matter may also be themed and adapted to a particular location; sites near major bank buildings might be marked with dollar sign mosaics, while those in Hong Kong often have an oriental theme. A revamped Mario Princess, installed at Bibo, a restaurant on Hollywood Road in Hong Kong, in 2014. The red and gold coloration reflects the five-element theory of Chinese philosophy. Each \\"invasion\\" usually takes around two or three weeks, with the actual installations taking at least a week. The mosaics are mapped, catalogued and photographed to indicate their locations within a city; using this data, the artist then prints and distributes city \\"invasion maps\\". Smartphone users can also hunt for mosaics globally using the \\"FlashInvaders\\" app. In Montpellier, locations were chosen so that, when plotted on a map, they form an image of a giant Space Invaders alien. More recently, Invader has adopted strategies to avoid the removal of his works. Since the 2010s, when his works became highly sought-after by art collectors and theft became a real concern, he has begun to choose sites that are more difficult to reach and to create larger works with more delicate tiles that cannot be removed without damaging the piece. He has also taken steps against legal action; in late 2015, while planning another \\"invasion\\" in New York City, he put out a call on social media for building owners who would be willing to host his mosaics legally. Rubikcubism Since 2004, Invader has also created a series of works, typically for indoor display, exclusively using Rubik's Cubes (a style the artist calls \\"Rubikcubism,\\" a play on the Cubist art movement of the early 20th century). Using a computer program, the artist works out the precise distribution of the six colors on a Rubik's Cube required to achieve the desired image; he then manipulates one side of each Rubik's Cube to reach the required pattern. Stacking the cubes eventually produces a full image, which is then glued to a backing board. Each piece is typically composed of approximately 300 cubes, measures about , and weighs approximately , though the exact dimensions depend on the subject and the level of detail. The works are organized into three series: \\"Bad Men,\\" comprising portraits of famous villains such as Osama bin Laden, Jaws and Al Capone; \\"Masterpieces,\\" which reproduces famous paintings by artists such as Delacroix, Warhol, Seurat, and Lichtenstein; and \\"Low Fidelity,\\" based on iconic album art such as Country Life, The Velvet Underground & Nico, and Nevermind. Among the images Invader has created using this technique are those of the Mona Lisa and the Dalai Lama; he received particular attention for a 2005 portrait of Florence Rey. Reception Invader has had solo exhibitions at art galleries in Paris, Osaka, Melbourne, Los Angeles, New York City, London, Rome and Lyon at Galerie de Bellecour (now Michali Gallery, Palm Beach; exhibition for which he created the famous \\"Rubik Mona Lisa\\"). He has exhibited works at the 6th Lyon Contemporary Art Biennale (2001), the MAMA Gallery in Rotterdam (2002), the Paris-based Magda Danysz Gallery (2003), the Borusan Center for Culture and Arts in Istanbul, Subliminal Projects in Los Angeles (2004), and Lazarides in London (2011). In 2010, he was included in the Banksy documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop, filmed by fellow urban artist Thierry Guetta (AKA Mr. Brainwash), whom Invader has claimed is his cousin. In 2011, he took part in \\"Art in the Streets, a MoCA LA show at the Geffen Contemporary curated by Jeffrey Deitch. His work, when sold in galleries, can fetch six-figure sums. Hong Kong Phooey (HK 58), sold for US$250,000 in early 2015 Fellow street artist Shepard Fairey wrote in Swindle: > Invader's pop art may seem shallow, but by taking the risk of illegally re- > contextualizing video game characters in an urban environment that provides > more chaotic social interaction than a gamer's bedroom, he makes a statement > about the desensitizing nature of video games and consumer culture. In a > postmodern paradox, a game like Grand Theft Auto takes the danger of the > streets and puts it in a safe video game, while Invader takes a safe video > game icon and inserts it into the danger of the streets. During an early 2014 \\"invasion\\" in Hong Kong comprising a total of 48 works, the city's Highways Department removed the life-sized Hong Kong Phooey (HK 58) mosaic, which had been placed by the side of a road in Fortress Hill. This angered local residents, who saw the removal as an example of the government only paying lip-service to promoting the arts in the city. In early 2015, a replica of the mosaic reached HK$1.96 million ($250,000) at auction at Sotheby's. NY145, featuring an invader and an old Apple Computer icon, sold for HK$562,500 ($72,000). A solo exhibition of new and retrospective works ‚Äì called Wipe Out ‚Äì was held in Hong Kong in May 2015 in association with the Hong Kong Contemporary Art Foundation and Le French May. In 2017, following an \\"invasion\\" in Ravenna, Italy (famed for its ancient mosaics), Invader installed a series of vegetarian-themed works in the \\"Veggietown\\" neighborhood of Paris (9th and 10th arr.) as a show of support for vegan restaurants.

Later it was held by Thateras until it was invaded by Sayyed Salar Masood Gazi in 1033 AD. A wandering saint, Maqdoom Shah, and later his disciple, Misbah-ul-Islam, commonly known as Qazi Bhikari, were appointed qazi of Pargana. In 1765 AD Jesuit missionary and traveller Joseph Tiefenthaler visited and described Mallawan as a small town built of bricks surrounded by many trees. With the advent of British Rule, followed by the annexation of Oudh in 1856, Mallawan was made district headquarter and possessed considerable political importance. During the struggle of 1857 the Raikawars, independence fighters from nearby village Rudamau, burned Mallawan's court house. Conditions worsened, leading to the move of the district headquarter to Hardoi.  Education  Mallawan is home to one of the oldest high schools in India, founded in 1857 by Ram Sahai Bajpai as Adarsh Shri Prasad Mahavidyalaya at Bajiganj.

Its members have included Lloyd Dunn, John Heck, Ralph Johnson, Paul Neff, and Linda Morgan Brown. Beginning with analog tape recorders, and later expanding to include digital technology and film media, the group has used collage techniques to create works that challenge the notion of intellectual property.Metzer, David Joel. Quotation and Cultural Meaning in Twentieth- Century Music, pp. 167-169. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 2003. Their works make extensive use of materials appropriated from various sources through a process they call \\"Plagiarism¬Æ\\". The Tape-beatles' body of work consists mainly of noise music and audio art recordings, expanded and performed cinema performances, videos, printed publications, as well as works in other media. They produce and release work under an umbrella organization called Public Works Productions. History Lineup and early years Members of The Tape-beatles currently include Lloyd Dunn and John Heck. Former or occasional members of the group have included Linda Morgan Brown, Chuck Hollister, Ralph Johnson, and Paul Neff. The group's initial focus was to create music that made use of techniques borrowed from musique concr√®te, but applied to a popular music context. To this end, they eschewed conventional musical instruments, instead contending that tape recording and the recording studio itself was their 'instrument'. The Tape-beatles, then consisting of Dunn, Heck and Johnson, put out their first major work, A subtle buoyancy of pulse in 1988. In keeping with the tape esthetic, the work was available only on cassette (until being reissued 10 years later on CD by Staalplaat, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Public response was sufficiently encouraging that the group immediately began work on a new album, adding two new members along the way: Paul Neff and Linda Morgan Brown. 1991‚Äì2000 A grant from Intermedia Arts Minnesota enabled The Tape-beatles to finish their second work in 1991, a CD for the Canadian label DOVentertainment, entitled Music with Sound. This was the record that put The Tape-beatles on the map to some extent, garnering favorable reviews in Keyboard,Dery, Mark. \\"Tape-beatles: Perfecting the Art of Plagiarism.\\" Keyboard Magazine, September. 1991. as well as putting them on the Top 10 Imports of the Year list in Pulse,Ashby, Paul. \\"Tape-beatles plunder a media-mad culture.\\" Pulse, November, 1991. the in- store magazine for the Tower Records chain. It remains the work for which the Tape-beatles are best known. Music with Sound not only established the group's signature style and technique, it also provided The Tape-beatles with a coherent soundtrack upon which to base a live public performance. Using multiple image projection devices (16 and 8 mm film on reels and loops, film strips and slide projectors), as well as an array of strange and obsolete recording equipment culled from audiovisual surplus outlets (the 'language master', the 'calophone', the 'wollensak', etc.). The presentation was a barrage of discarded educational and motivational material put to a musical score that varied from the bombastic to the delicate and subtly constructed. The climax of the piece found the audience being surrounded by a single room- sized tape loop. The year 1993 saw the release of The Grand Delusion (Staalplaat), a bitter mediation on the U.S. Persian Gulf War and the historical context that created it.Daniels, Godfrey. \\"Conversation with a Tape-beatle.' X Magazine, 1994. In addition, the group refined their presentation approach, distilling it down to just three 16 mm projectors, used in a configuration the group named 'Polyvision', in honor of Abel Gance's pioneering movie techniques of the 1920s.Samuelsen, Grant. \\"The Tape-beatles Live at The Empty Bottle\\".\\" Projector no. 10: Chicago Cultural Guide, June 1999. (Later this technique was renamed 'expanded cinema', and eventually 'performed cinema', by the group.) In the meantime, Ralph Johnson moved to Oakland, Calif., to study composition at Mills College. Lloyd Dunn suspended all zine production (see PhotoStatic Magazine) and went on a yearlong trip abroad, spending most of the time in France (see The Expatriot), but also dropping in on John Heck, then living in Prague. Upon Dunn's return to the United States, he and Ralph Johnson regrouped to form the duo Public Works. Using similar principles to the Tape-beatles, Public Works laid the focus on digital audio production, and tightened the emphasis on the making of music, with a reduced emphasis on pure sound collage or 'audio art'. 1997's Matter (Staalplaat) was the group's d√©but recording. An 'expanded cinema' performance of that name was also created, and the group performed that and The Grand Delusion in a dozen cities from San Francisco to Berlin, Germany. In 2000, Public Works released the EP Numbers on the Elevator Bath label. It explored the sounds of EVP (Electronic voice phenomenon) recordings, purported to document paranormal phenomena, and the so-called \\"numbers stations\\" that can occasionally be heard on the shortwave band. Some of the works sampled liberally from Akin Fernandez' \\"The Conet Project\\" recordings. 2001‚Äìpresent John Heck rejoined the group to work on a new proposed work for The Tape-beatles that would be called Good Times.Kimm, Todd. \\"Meet the Tape-beatles.\\" Icon [Iowa City, Ia.] January, 2000. A long-term project, it was envisioned from the start that the composition would take its full form as an audio visual presentation. The work was completed in September 2001. It premiered at the Sound Unseen Film Festival in Minneapolis, USA in October 2001, which also inaugurated a Tape-beatle tour of the US Midwest. At the Sound Unseen Festival (Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minn., October, 2001), The Tape- beatles took an afternoon to improvise with fellow sound-collage artists Escape Mechanism (Jon Nelson), Steev Hise and Wobbly (Jon Leidecker). The result was the mini-CD and mini-VideoCD Minneapolis Summit. More recently, The Tape-beatles have been performing their retrospective 'performed cinema' performance entitled \\"G.N.P.\\", compiled from their previous film performances, throughout Europe in 2005. Both Heck and Dunn currently reside in Prague, the Czech Republic. In 2007, the group was asked to provide 28 minutes of programming for The Radia Network a series that highlights electronic and experimental sound work. The program was put together from older previously unreleased material, with a generous selection of new work. That same year, the Tape-beatles were commissioned by Czech Radio to produce a 24-minute composition for broadcast as part of the series rAdioCUSTICA, edited by Michal Rataj. The resulting work, \\"Sombre Gertrude - Piece for Stings,\\" was first broadcast in January 2008.

It is in the southern Punjab \\"cotton belt\\", where production per kilometer is one of the highest in India. Malout is on NH-354 and NH-9 and NH-7, which connects Fazilka to Mana. The boundaries of Haryana and Rajasthan are and , respectively, from the town. Malout is from the border with Pakistan, and has been affected by military incidents. History Shiv Singh Johiya (959 AD) was ruler of Kot Malot (Muktsar) (Punjab). He was attacked by Yavanas in 959 AD and lost his kingdom. He along with 12 sons moved from Kot Malot (Malout) (Muktsar) (Punjab) to Sidhmukh in Rajasthan. Khemraj was eldest son of Raja Shiv Singh (959 AD),and 12 th son was malaji who is said to have given name to Mechu Clan of Jats. Malout was founded 400‚Äì500 years ago, and the origin of its name is uncertain. In 1917, the British government established the Bathinda‚ÄìKarachi railway line; the Malout railway station was built the following year. The town was incorporated on 19 March 1920. A seven-member committee purchased land, which was divided into shopping and residential areas. On 17 November 1921, Firozpur district commissioner J. C. Koldsitrimiu established a water-storage and -purification tank system in Malout. Edward, Prince of Wales, visited the region that day and the system was named in his honour. Malout began growing, and the town had a post office, telephone exchange, guest house and cemetery by the end of 1940. With cotton producers and the agricultural machinery industry, Malout and its nearby villages were known as the cotton capital of Punjab. Commerce and industry Malout is known for its agricultural-equipment manufacturing industry. Agricultural equipment made in the town is sold throughout Punjab and the rest of India. Other major industries in the region are cotton cultivation and apparel manufacturing; the clothing business in Malout dates back several centuries. A substantial market exists for used cars and motorcycles. Climate The region's temperature varies widely by season. Summer temperatures reach , and winter temperatures fall to . The western Himalayas in the north and the Thar Desert in the south and southwest primarily determine the climate. The south- western monsoon brings nearly 70 percent of the annual rainfall from July to September. Most of the district has an arid (tropic) moisture regime, according to soil-classification criteria. Soil-moisture computations using the Newhall mathematical model indicate that the region has a \\"weak aridic\\" moisture regime (Van Wambeke, 1985). Education Malout Institute of Management and Information Technology is a government engineering college, and Guru Teg Bahadur Khalsa Institute of Engineering and Technology is a private college. The town has government senior secondary schools for boys and girls, and a number of English-language private schools. D. A. V. Edward Ganj Senior Secondary Public School is one of Malout's oldest schools. Guru Tegh Bahadur Khalsa Senior Secondary School and S. D. Senior Secondary School are the oldest private schools, and Sacred Heart Convent School offers an ICSE curriculum. The D.A.V. College Managing Committee offers graduate and post- graduate courses.

The village itself has 20 homes and about 74 people. It includes a national school, shop, hurling pitch (Mc Donnell Park) and two housing estates. Points of interest Churches and religious sites The church in Ballinkillin is dedicated to St. Lazerian and there is a stained glass window by Wilson of Youghal to his honour in the church. There are four other examples of stained glass windows -in honour of St. Joseph, St. Patrick, Our Lady and Christ - all donated to the church. Little is known of its history but it was built about 1793 by Fr. Michael Brophy and is one of the oldest churches in the diocese. It is likely it was a \\"barn church\\". The church at Lorum was more than likely the place of worship before this time and tradition says that there was a \\"mass\\" house near Ballinkillin Cross. In 1798 the church escaped plunder by the Crown forces as it was then thatched and looked like a farm building and they passed it by. The chapel yard started as a burial ground about 1817 and was consecrated by Bishop Doyle on Thursday, 26 September 1821. The long aisle was added to the church at this time, making it cross shaped. The Calvary was erected in 1935, the statue to Our Lady in 1955 and the cement paths around the church were completed in 1989 by voluntary labour, the materials were donated. Lorum church is located approximately 1.5 miles from Ballinkillin. Dedicated as the Church of the Good Shepherd by Bishop Neal in 2001 . The church is surrounded by the church burial ground. To the rear of this church is a very old chapel ruin and cemetery. One headstone dates back to 1730. Also near Lorum is the remains of a High Cross. Near the village of Ballinkillin on the Lorum side there was what was known as the \\"religious bush\\". According to local tradition, a woman was shot in 1798 and is buried there. In times past procession were made from the chapel to pray at this spot, before returning to the chapel again. It is also noted that the \\"dead coach\\" was seen in the Ballinkillin area. In May 1985, a Committee was formed to discuss the erection of a Lourdes Grotto in Ballinkillin. Under the chairmanship of Fr. Denis Murphy, C.C. the project got underway. A site known as \\"The Grove\\" opposite the church was donated by Mrs. Maeve Hughes. The grotto was built with local granite stone and voluntary labour at a cost of approximately ¬£4,000. The statues of Our Lady of Lourdes and St. Bernadette were donated by the Presentation Sisters, Carlow, on the closure of their convent in Tullow Street. Up to 300 people attended the official opening on 1 October 1989. The ceremony of rosary and benediction was conducted by Fr. E. Dowling, P.P. and Fr. Mulhall, C. Sport Ballinkillin Gaelic Athletic Association undertook a major development in 1992. It transformed a field, earlier purchased from the Land Commission, into a full size playing pitch complete with dressing rooms and a meeting room. It will be ready for use in Autumn 1993. The cost to date of this development is in excess of ¬£80,000. At the moment the Hurling Club caters for ten different teams, from U-10 up to Intermediate. The first Football Club was formed in 1937. The founding members of the Club were: Chairman: Peter Clerkin; Treasurer: Jackie McDonnell; Secretary: John O'Neill. Committee: Bill Coady, Jim Connors, John Connors, Bill Doyle and Jim Larkin. They won the Junior Championship in 1940 when they beat St. Dympna's, Carlow. In 1944 they won the Intermediate Championship. The Hurling Club was formed in 1958 and continued until 1962. Its most noteworthy achievement was reaching the Junior Hurling Final in 1962. The Club reformed in 1971 with Tommy Murphy, Chairman, and John O'Neill, Secretary. In 1973 they won the Senior County Final beating Naoimh E√≥in, Myshall. The Club has also had success in the Bolger Cup in 1972,1973,1977 and the U-21 championships in 1978 and 1979. One of the players, Cyril Hughes, was selected and travelled with the Australia 982. The juvenile teams were formed in the mid-1980s. They won numerous county titles, most notable the U-16 A hurling in 1991. In 2001, Ballinkillin won its second senior hurling championship beating Mount Leinster Rangers in the final. Other recent success includes winning 3 minor hurling championships in a row between 2000 and 2002. Community centre The first meeting to consider building a community centre in Ballinkillin was held on 8 November 1974. At this meeting it was decided to go ahead and arrange the necessary fund raising. Part of the land was purchased from Corries Estate for the sum of one penny and the other section -15 feet wide - was purchased from Carlow County Council for ¬£10. Five trustee were elected: Fr. D. Murphy, C.C., Canon Rowntree, Lar Farrell, John Ryan and Willie Kidd. Keenan Brothers erected the main ironwork structure and the block work was completed by local voluntary help. The floor in the hall was purchased from McMahons of Limerick and put in place by T. Collier at a cost of ¬£1,651.90. An extension containing supper room, kitchen and toilets, was added in 1979. The Centre was officially opened on 1 November 1979. In 1985 a club licence for the sale of alcohol was obtained and in that year the supper room was converted into a lounge bar. The Club bar opened in December 1985. A new lounge was built in 1990. The community hall is frequently used for badminton, as well as many parties and other celebratory occasions. National School Parish Priest of Dunleckney, Rev. M. Prendergast, built the school in Ballinkillin in 1810 with subscriptions of the Catholics, he contributed ¬£50. The cost of building and furnishing the school was approximately ¬£200. It is one of the oldest schools in continuous use in the country. A lease of the ground was given for ever by David La Touche to trustees for the use of the public. He also donated the rents of the two annual fairs of Slyguff for the support of the school where all the poor children of his estate and the vicinity could be educated. David La Touche was a member of the La Touche Bank in Dublin and his father was first Governor of the Bank of Ireland. It is recorded that during the Irish famine his father allowed what money might be needed to buy meal for the poor to be drawn from his bank, his sons carried on this tradition of charity. David La Touche lived in Upton House, Fenagh, and Harcourt Street, Dublin. Rev. Martin Brennan in his book Schools of Kildare and Leighlin 1775-1835, describing conditions in Co. Carlow at that time said: \\"The chief obstacle to the education of the Irish peasantry, at least in this part of the country, is their poverty. They have neither food nor raiment for the greater part, and even if they had, they have not the means of paying a small pittance to the master or of buying a book\\". According to Fr. Brennan's book, the master, John Brennan, Tipperary, was appointed in 1816. He was 39 years of age and is described as being of good character. There was no fixed salary for the school; the master received ¬£10 annually for his attention both to the school and the chapel adjoining. School was held every day throughout the year except Sundays and holidays. Children were charged quarterly fees for the subjects they took - spelling cost 2s. 2d., writing 3s. 3d. and arithmetic 5s. 5d. A connection was sought to be formed with the Kildare Place Society in 1824. A sum of money was sought, and received, from the Society for the purpose of procuring the necessary fixtures for the school and for building a second floor for the purpose of a female school. The national school system was introduced in 1831. Ballinkillin N.S. appears to have been part of the national school system in 1861. In 1960, the extension which is now the principal' s room was added. The school was a three-teacher school at that time. In 1981 a fourth teacher was appointed. The cloakroom upstairs was used as a classroom until the first pre-fab room was built in 1984. When the fifth teacher was appointed in 1985 the play shed was used as a classroom pending the building of a new school. However, this plan was abandoned due to Government cutbacks. Further renovations were carried out in 1990 which improved conditions for both teachers and pupils. The main building was re- roofed and all interior and exterior walls were painted. The work was carried out by Eamon Lalor, Garryhill, with heating contractors McCarthy/Blanchfield of Gowran and Byrne Electrical of Carlow at a cost of ¬£56,000. Ancient Ireland A fine example of stone art can be found at the O'Gormans; the marked stone is part of the gate to Ballinkillin Lodge.

The purpose of EuroSim is to provide a framework for a partial simulation of a major EU issue. More than two hundred students, drawn from universities in North America and Europe, participate in the simulation. All students are assigned roles, including Members of the European Parliament, members of the European Commission, heads of government, and national ministers. Students prepare for the simulation at their own universities, with the help of faculty advisers and guidance that is provided through a course management website. Researching the simulation topic and the assigned roles constitutes an important part of all students' preparatory work. The simulations themselves are held over a period of four days, with the venue alternating between the U.S. and Europe annually. Recent issues simulated include energy policy, asylum policy, food safety, enlargement, the Constitutional Convention, the Intergovernmental Conference, EU neighborhood policy, Kosovo, EU-Russia relations, EU Budget, migration policy, and data retention.  History  The idea for a model European Union came in the fall of 1987 when students at State University of New York (SUNY) College at Brockport asked the political science department to sponsor a model United Nations. After thorough consideration by faculty, students at SUNY Brockport agreed to be involved in a project regarding what was formerly called the European Community. The first simulation was held on the Brockport campus, April 8‚Äì10, 1988. Involving SUNY and private New York schools, the simulation held the title SUNYMEC (State University of New York Model European Community). It wasn‚Äôt until 1992 the simulation established the label EuroSim and became a trans-Atlantic exchange with its first overseas meeting in Luxemburg. The 2003 simulation event was the first time EuroSim was a trans- Atlantic endeavor - a sure sign of the simulation‚Äôs maturity. The term ‚Äútrans- Atlantic‚Äù indicates the simulation is organized and planned by faculty and students from both Europe and the United States. In fact, EuroSim 2003 was the first time the simulation was planned by U.S. and European student directors equally. A simulation was held at the Europaisch Akademie in Otzenhausen, Germany in 2008. The 2009 EuroSim was hosted by Canisius College in Buffalo, New York, followed by a simulation at the University of Antwerp in 2010. In 2011, EuroSim moved out of New York state for the first time, with Widener University in Chester, Pennsylvania. In 2012, The University of Lower Silesia in Wroclaw, Poland held the simulation. The most recent simulation was held at East Stroudsburg University, Pennsylvania, April 4-7 2013. The next edition will be hosted by the University of Twente, the Netherlands, January 4-7 2014 on the theme of \\"Economic and Social Policy: Minimum Income Directive\\". Sponsorship EuroSim is funded and supported through sponsorship by the following organizations: *TACEUSS, the Trans-Atlantic Consortium for European Union Studies and Simulations, a not-for-profit corporation whose members are dues-paying colleges and universities both in Europe and North America. Its mission is to conduct annual simulations of the European Union and provide study and research opportunities for students enrolled at colleges and universities within its consortium.

Biography John was the eldest son of Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg (1371‚Äì1440), and Elisabeth of Bavaria- Landshut (1383‚Äì1442), daughter of Frederick, Duke of Bavaria, and his second wife Maddalena Visconti. After marrying Barbara of Saxe-Wittenberg (1405‚Äì1465), daughter of Rudolf III, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg, John hoped to eventually succeed to Saxe-Wittenberg once its line of Ascanian dukes died out. When this happened in November 1422, however, Emperor Sigismund was on poorer terms with the Hohenzollerns and was only willing to compensate John with a monetary payment. John began participating in governmental affairs in Brandenburg in 1424. Frustrated by disputes with the feudal nobility, Frederick I retired to his castle at Cadolzburg in Franconia in 1425, granting the regency of Brandenburg to John at a Landtag in Rathenow on January 13, 1426, while retaining the electoral dignity for himself. John was poorly received by the populace of Brandenburg, as his administration was incompetent, leading to unrest in the countryside. Rather than governing, John was more interested in artificially creating gold through alchemy, thereby receiving the cognomen \\"the Alchemist\\". In 1433, a revised version of the alchemical treatise Buch der heiligen Dreifaltigkeit of Ulmannus was prepared for John. Realizing the danger Brandenburg was in, Frederick I granted John Franconian lands in Brandenburg-Kulmbach on June 7, 1437, territory rich with mines that furnished materials for the Alchemist's hobby. The governance of Brandenburg passed to Frederick I's second-oldest son, Frederick II. After the death of Frederick I in 1440, John inherited all of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, including the castle of Plassenburg in Kulmbach. In his later years, he allowed Christopher of Bavaria to administer his possessions in the Upper Palatinate until Christopher's death in 1448. John ruled as Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach until abdicating in 1457, which allowed him to dedicate himself toward studying alchemy and the environs of Franconia. He died in Castle Scharfeneck near Baiersdorf in 1464. Family and children John of Brandenburg-Kulmbach and Barbara of Saxe-Wittenberg had four children: * Rudolf of Brandenburg (born and died in 1424) * Barbara of Brandenburg (1423 - 7 November 1481), married on 12 November 1433 Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua. * Elisabeth of Brandenburg (1425 - after 13 January 1465); married, firstly, on 27 August 1440, Joachim, Duke of Pomerania. Married, secondly, on 5 March 1454, Wartislaw X, Duke of Pomerania. * Dorothea of Brandenburg (1431 - 10 November 1495); married, firstly, on 12 September 1445, King Christopher III of Denmark.

When the base closed, the air station became the Subic Bay International Airport and is still operating today.  Background  During the Korean War, Admiral Arthur W. Radford, Chief of Naval Operations saw the need for a naval air station at Cubi Point. It was a rugged and jungle-covered finger of land from Subic Naval Base. Radford believed the air station would be a vital link for the U.S. Navy in the Philippines. In spite of the magnitude of the job and the tremendous difficulties the construction involved, the project was approved by The Pentagon. Civilian contractors were initially contracted to fulfill the project, but after seeing the forbidding Zambales Mountains and the maze of jungle at Cubi Point, they claimed it could not be done. The Navy's Seabees were then given the project in 1951. The first Seabees to arrive were MCB-3 on October 2, 1951; the second, MCB-5, arrived on November 5, 1951; the third, MCB-2 arrived early in 1952. MCBs 9 and 11 followed later. The first problem encountered was moving the fishing village of Banicain, which occupied a portion of the site for the new airfield. The town and its residents were moved to Olongapo, which became New Banicain. The former village of Banicain is now under of earth. The next, and biggest, issue was cutting a mountain in half and moving soil to fill in Subic Bay and create a runway. The Seabees blasted coral to fill a section of Subic Bay, filled swampland, removed trees as large as tall and in diameter. It was one of the largest earthmoving projects in the world, equivalent to the construction of the Panama Canal. The construction project took five years and an estimated 20 million man-hours. The $100-million facility (equivalent to $ million in ) was commissioned on July 25, 1956 and comprised an air station and an adjacent pier that was capable of docking the Navy's largest carriers. On December 21, 1972, Naval Air Station Cubi Point was renamed to honor Admiral Arthur W. Radford. Radford had the unusual honor of personally dedicating the facility. A plaque memorializing the occasion reads:  Operations  An aerial view of Cubi PointEventually, NAS Cubi Point served as the primary maintenance, repair and supply center for the 400 carrier-based aircraft of the Seventh Fleet's carrier force. During the Vietnam War, its jet engine shop turned out two jet engines per day to keep pace with demand. NAS Cubi Point and Naval Base Subic Bay were also prominently used during Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield. On June 15, 1991, Mt. Pinatubo, only from Subic Bay, erupted and blanketed the facility in ash deep. Dependents were evacuated and the Navy began an intense clean-up effort to return the station to normal operations. Within two weeks, they returned the station back to limited operations. Within four weeks, the Navy had restored almost all services to most of the family housing. By September, most dependents had returned to Subic Bay and Cubi Point, but in the same month the Senate of the Philippines voted to require the United States to withdraw from all of its facilities in the Philippines. The withdrawal was completed in November 1992 and shortly after NAS Cubi Point became Cubi Point International Airport, later renamed Subic Bay International Airport. Upon closure, the vast collection of squadron memorabilia displayed in the Cubi Point Officers' Club was shipped to the National Museum of Naval Aviation at NAS Pensacola, Florida, and now forms the decor of the Cubi Bar Caf√©, which opened in 1996 as the museum's restaurant.http://www.navalaviationmuseum.org/attractions/cubi- bar-cafe/ Accidents and incidents *5 December 1971: P-3A Orion #152151 had 2 engines explode shortly after takeoff and ditched. 1 of the 16 occupants was killed. *31 October 1972: KA6D Intruder #151809 attached to VA-196 on USS Enterprise stalled and crashed on take-off into Subic Bay, both crew members killed. *2 November 1978: Lockheed S-3A 160590 crashed at night on Mount Slanging, two miles southwest of the Cubi Point Naval Air Station, having had taken off from the Cubi airfield seven minutes before on a training flight. https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/57039 *26 June 1979: P-3B #154596 lost power to 2 engines after takeoff and crashed while attempting to return to land. 5 of the 15 occupants were killed.

The shield was discovered in the River Witham in the vicinity of Washingborough and Fiskerton in Lincolnshire, England in 1826. Further excavations at a nearby site have revealed posts interpreted as the foundation for a causeway, as well as artefacts including a sword, spears and part of a human skull with a sword fragment lodged within. The shield is now in the British Museum.Witham Shield, accessed August 2010 Appearance The Witham Shield is an example of the style of Celtic art known as La T√®ne. The bronze facings show evidence of having been reworked. The most noticeable feature is the central dome which would have been required for functional reasons as it allowed the owner to hold the shield close to its centre of gravity. Originally a leather silhouette of a long-legged wild boar would have been riveted to the shield around the central dome, as indicated by small rivet holes and staining of the shield. The pattern of discolouration was very clear when the shield was recovered from the River Witham (see 1863 drawing below). Although it is still possible to see the discolouration under certain lighting conditions, the boar design is no longer easy to make out. The boar may have been a tribal emblem or represented the prowess of the shield's owner, but could also have been a representation of the Celtic god Moccus.J. B. Whitwell, The Coritani: some aspects of the Iron Age tribe and the Roman civitas (B.A.R., 1982), p. 10 The shield also has a number of birds and animals incorporated into the design. The roundels at each end are inspired by the heads of birds, which are supported by horses with wings for ears. Birds similar to crested grebes are engraved on the central spine and this completes the engraving work elsewhere.Early Celtic Art in Britain, Ruth and Vincent Megaw, p.29, accessed 16 August 2010 Drawing of the shield made in 1863 by Orlando Jewitt in John Kemble's book Horae Ferales, clearly showing the long-legged boar Construction The shield was made principally from wood, now perished, to a design later known as a \\"Gaulish Shield\\" that originated in the seventh century BC. What remains is an almost complete facing that had been made to cover its surface. The sheeting is 0.2-0.3 mm thick and was designed to be applied to a wooden backing estimated at 8 mm thick. There are two main sheets that meet at the midpoint of the shield. Each of these sheets is just over one metre long. The join is not neat, and it is hidden from view by a covering strip. The shield is decorated with a central spindle boss, on which are pieces of red coral that are thought to have come from the Mediterranean area.\\"The Witham Shield\\", E. M. Jope, British Museum Quarterly, Vol. 35, No. 1/4 (Spring, 1971), pp. 61‚Äì69, British Museum, accessed 16 August 2010 Importance The shield has been described as a \\"tour de force\\" of beaten bronze work. There are no other complete bronze facings that survive in Europe. This is partially due to their rarity, as Celtic shields were normally constructed from unsheathed wood. The idea of covering a shield with bronze may indicate Greek and Etruscan influence. The shield is comparable with other shields found in Britain dating from the same period, such as the Chertsey Shield and the Battersea Shield which were also found in rivers. The British Museum consider this shield to be \\"one of the best examples of the way British craftspeople adopted the new style of La T√®ne art\\". Ownership The shield entered the collection of Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick (1783‚Äì1848), a noted collector of arms and armour, and after his death the shield and other items of Iron Age armour were left to his cousin, Lt. Colonel Augustus Meyrick, who disposed of them between 1869 and 1872. The shield was purchased by Augustus Franks, an independently wealthy antiquarian who worked for the British Museum. In 1872 Franks presented the shield to the British Museum, one of over 20,000 objects that he donated to the museum during his lifetime or by bequest at his death.Objects donated by Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks.

Accessed 17 August 2010 [Witham Shield - BM registration number - 1872,1213.1] Related finds Detail of the central boss An unusual triple headed dress pin was also found in 1826. This pin set was also found in the River Witham near Fiskerton. This is described as the only surviving set of triple dress pins and has been dated as 8th century and Anglo-Saxon. The pin set is also held in the British Museum.Triple Pin Set, British Museum highlights, accessed 22 August 2010 In the 20th century a series of posts were found together with an early to mid Iron Age sword when a dyke was being cleaned near Fiskerton, near where the Witham Shield had been found. Excavations in 1981 revealed the posts to be a wooden causeway which dendrochronologists dated to a period between 457 and 300 BC. It appeared to have been repaired and added to every eighteen years or so during that period, even though the construction and maintenance of a walkway on such a scale at that time would have been a major feat of engineering. Hundreds of artifacts were also found around the causeway, including eleven spears, six swords, woodworking and metalworking tools, as well as part of a human skull which had a crescent-shaped chop mark, probably inflicted by a sword; this injury is unlikely to have killed the man.Field, Naomi and Pearson, Mike Parker, 2003 Fiskerton: An Iron Age Timber Causeway with Iron Age and Roman Votive Offerings, (Oxbow Books, Oxford). Twenty years later, during further excavations at the site, more sections of the causeway were dug out, some of them containing posts several metres long, plus a complete spear, a currency bar, a sword, a dagger and some bronze fittings, all of which appeared to have been deliberately damaged before their burial.Kennedy, Anra. \\"Treasures of the Celtic Causeway - The Fiskerton Log Boat\\", Culture24, 26 March 2002. Accessed 20 August 2010 The most important discovery was two Iron Age votive boats. One of these boats, as well as other artifacts from the site, can be seen at The Collection in Lincoln.

Pincode of Mandalgarh is 311604.http://www.citypincode.in/RAJASTHAN/BHILWARA/MANDALGARH_PINCODE History Mandalgarh was ruled by Brahma kings , the last Brahma king of Mandalgarh was Mandiya Brahma. The place, situated at a distance of 54 km towards South-East of Bhilwara. It is sub division, tehsil and panchayat samiti of same name. The place is of historical importance because it was the scene of many a fierce battle during the mediaeval times, according to the Muslim historians. The place was taken twice by Mahmud Khilji of Malwa in the middle of the fifteenth century, and subsequently appears to have belonged alternately to the Ranas of Mewar and the Mughal emperors. In or about 1650, Shah Jahan granted it in Jagir to Raja Roop Singh of Kishangarh, who partially built a palace here, but Rana Raj Singh retook it in 1660. Twenty years later, Aurangzeb captured the palace and in 1700 made it over to Jhujar Singh Chief of Pisangan (now in Ajmer district) from whom it was recovered by Rana Amar Singh in 1706, and it since then remained in the uninterrupted possession of his successors. Chivalrous Mehta Agar Chand (Bachhawat), son of Mehta Prithviraj, then adviser to Maharana Ari Singh II since 1761, was also appointed as first Kiledar of Mandalgarh Fort in 1765. The patta signed and given by Maharana Ari Singh II (1761-73) of Mewar reads - \\"My order to Brother Mehta Agar Chand. The district of Mandalgarh has become rebellious, considering you to be our own person, we are sending you there. Try your best for the good of the Maharana and while trying for good, some wrong may be overlooked. Settle there with your family so long as Shri Eklingji's supremacy prevails, the district shall be yours. Build houses for your dwelling and try to inhabit people and farmers by granting them concessions. Manage the affairs of the fort with strong hand\\". Mehta Agar Chand strengthened the fortifications by repairing, reconstruction and remodelling the outer walls of defence and repaired the existing gates. Mehta Agar Chand, later served Mewar as Pradhan (1767-69 and 1796-99). Mandalgarh Fort remained under the Kiledaari of successive Bachhawat Mehtas till Independence of India in 1947. To the North-West is a fort about half a mile in length with a low rampart wall and bastions encircling the crest of the hill on which it stands. The fort is said to have been constructed by a chief of the Balnote Clan of Rajputs (a branch of Solankis). There is an old temple Jaleshwar by name (1619 v.s.) The fort also houses a temple dedicated to Shiva near Mandalgarh a small village Vitthalpura. During medieval period, due to an unknown reason (possibly due to frequently happening battles), some of the families of ruling Brahma community migrated & settled themselves in North Maharashtra's Shirpur tehsil of Dhule district. These people formed a small village with the same name as Mandalgarh and retained the same name for few centuries. Over the time \\"garh\\" from Mandalgarh was chopped off by people who preferred to call shorter version of name of the village, \\"Mandal\\", in their daily routines. The village is still known as Mandal and some of the aged people alive still remember that their grandparents or great grandparents used to call Mandal as Mandalgarh. The local language of people of village Mandal is Ahirani (aka Khandeshi) which has a lot of words that match with those of Rajasthani words. Geography Mandalgarh is located at .

The Venomous Reptiles of the Western Hemisphere. Comstock Publishing Associates, Ithaca and London. 870 pp. 1500 plates. . The type locality given is \\"between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains\\". Behavior Primarily found in grassland areas, on the edge of open woodland, or on rocky hillsides, and often makes use of the burrows of other animals for shelter. They primarily eat rodents, but they may also eat lizards and frogs. Their rattles are significantly higher pitched than those of larger species of rattlesnake, sometimes giving them the nickname buzztail. They are primarily nocturnal, especially during the summer months when it is too hot for them to be active, but they will sometimes be found out sunning themselves. They are most often found immediately after rain storms. Venom Drop for drop, massasauga venom is more potent than that of many larger species of rattlesnake, but due to the lower yield (the amount it is capable of delivering in a single bite) its potential for harm is greatly reduced. The venom is a powerful hemotoxin which can cause swelling, necrosis, and severe pain. Despite its smaller size and less severe bite, envenomation can still be fatal if untreated, and treatment should be sought immediately for any venomous snake bite. The antivenin CroFab, while not type-specific, can be used to treat severe envenomations from massasaugas. References Further reading * Hubbs, Brian and Brendan O'Connor. 2012.

In the northern tip of the bay lies the Tseung Kwan O Village. View of Junk Bay (Tseung Kwan O) in 2019 The Tseung Kwan O New Town, one of the nine new towns in Hong Kong, was mainly built on reclaimed land in the northern half of the bay. The population as of 2011 is about 368,000. Name In Cantonese, Tseung Kwan () means the \\"general\\" of an army, and O () means \\"bay\\". Therefore, Tseung Kwan O literally means \\"general's Bay\\". The exact origin of the name Tseung Kwan O is unknown, but it is said to be named in honour of a Ming Dynasty soldier who visited Tseung Kwan O at some point. Another theory is that the name was chosen in the 17th century, when naval battles were fought against pirates from Japan at Tseung Kwan O. Yet another theory is that the pronunciation of \\"Â∞áËªç\\" can sound like \\"Junk Wan\\" to the ears of English speakers; wan is also a transliteration of the Chinese word for \\"bay\\" (). The current town center of Tseung Kwan O stands on reclaimed land. The English name Junk Bay was said to be derived from the existence of junks in the bay, and the reclamation land based on the landfill . The first landfill was opened in 1978, decades after Junk Bay was named.Waste management in Hong Kong The Fat Tong Chau (Junk Island) is in the southeastern part of the bay. History and geography Junk Bay in 1950s The bay is near the eastern mouth of Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour. A local gazette, Genuine record of Guangdong province (Chinese traditional: Á≤µÂ§ßË®ò), clearly contained the place name: Â∞áËªçÊæ≥ (Chinese characters of Tseung Kwan O). A genuine record of Guangdong province was published during the Ming Dynasty: Residents inhabited Tseung Kwan O area then. Before the development of the new town, the area around the bay was occupied by fishing towns and villages. Settlements in the area began as early as in the 13th century. Major settlements, however, did not occur until the late 16th century when small fishing villages were founded in the area. Hang Hau quickly emerged into a market town and became the most populated and prosperous place in the whole of Clear Water Bay Peninsula; it continued for the next few centuries as such. Other towns and villages include Rennie's Mill (Tiu Keng Leng), Hang Hau and Yau Yue Wan. Rennie's Mill was where Kuomintang loyalists were settled following the end of the Chinese civil war, and Hang Hau had a ship-building industry. The Hong Kong Government had been interested in developing a new town at Hang Hau because of its proximity to the urban area. The project was postponed for a long time owing to the extensive scale of reclamation in the bay, which is rather deep. It finally started under the name of Tseung Kwan O. The area of Tseung Kwan O is about 1,790 ha, with a projected population of 490,000 upon completion. Tseung Kwan O today comprises five main areas: Po Lam, Hang Hau, Tseung Kwan O, Tiu Keng Leng and LOHAS Park. Climate Development of Tseung Kwan O In 1983, development of Phase I of the New Town to an initial population of about 175,000 was formally endorsed. By 1986, construction of the two tubes of Tseung Kwan O Tunnel began, which provided potential for further increasing the population of the New Town. To maximize the utilization of the road infrastructure and to meet the demand for land for public housing, the Government decided that the New Town should include a Phase II development, with an increase in the projected population to about 325,000. To cater for redevelopment of the Tiu Keng Leng Cottage Area and to provide land for development of Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate and deep waterfront industries, in 1988, the Government further decided to proceed with Phase III development of the New Town for about 490,000 people.

Mandva is situated in the Vindhyanchal Range at 2,000 feet above sea level. There is a deep ravine which separates it from the Malwa Plateau in Central India. Mandav is 100 km from Indore, the nearest airport. History The history of Mandav, also known as Mandu, is known from the Paramara period in the 8th century A.D. Later it was under Mughal rule. They called it Shadiabad, which means ‚ÄòThe City of Joy‚Äô. The monuments are a mix of the Hindu and Afghan style of architecture. Mandu is a celebration in stone, of life and joy, of the love of the poet-prince Baz Bahadur for his beautiful consort, Rani Roopmati. The balladeers of Malwa still sing of the romance of these royal lovers, and high up on the crest of a hill, Roopmati's Pavilion still gazes down at Baz Bahadur's Palace, a magnificent expression of Afghan architecture. Under Mughal rule, Mandu was a pleasure resort, it's lakes and palaces the scenes of splendid and extravagant festivities. Places of interest This article needs to merge with Mandu,_Madhya_Pradesh#Places_of_interest There are number of monuments in Mandav. Among the most important are: The Delhi Darwaja and Hoshang Shah tomb The Delhi Darwaja is one of the twelve gateways to the city and is made up of reddish stone. The Hoshang Shahs tomb is a fine example of Afghan style architecture. It is said that four architects from Shah Jahan‚Äôs court visited Mandu and took inspiration for the Taj Mahal. File:Hoshang Shah's Tomb 02.jpgHoshang Shah's Tomb The Jahaz Mahal and Hindola Mahal The Jahaz Mahal, or the ship palace, resembles a ship sailing in water. There are two lakes, Kapur Talao and the Munja Talao, at the front of and behind the monument. The beautiful reflection of the palace can be seen in the tank waters. This was built in the period of Sultan Ghias-ud-din Khilji as a pleasure resort for his large harem. The Hindola Mahal or the Swing Palace has been built with sloping walls, which make it look like a swing. This was used as an audience hall. There is a step well called Champa Baoli near it, which was connected to under ground rooms with arrangements for cold and hot water for bathing. File:Jahaz Mahal 10.jpgJahaz Mahal File:Hindola Mahal 01.jpgHindola Mahal Palaces of Roopmati and Bazbahadur The palace of Sultan Bazbahadur and Roopmati are exquisite examples of the Islamic style of architecture. They have large courtyards. The palace of Roopmati was used as a check post in the times of an invasion. The tale of these two still resonates in the monuments of Mandu. Sultan Bazbahadur had gone to the dense woods near the Narmada River. Here he heard a sweet voice singing a divine song. When he reached the spot, he saw a beautiful maiden singing to the woods, the deer and the birds. He was mesmerized by her beauty and enchanted by her voice. When he asked her to become his wife she told him that until and unless the River Narmada starts flowing at Mandu she will not be able to marry him. This was because she used to pay homage to the river before having her food. The Sultan then went to the river and asked it to climb over the mountain and start flowing at Mandu. The river god granted his wish and told him to search for a sacred tamarisk and dig wherever it is found. There he found a spring of pure Narmada water which was a tributary. The king dug a reservoir at the place which was called the Rewa Kund. Rewa is another name of the river Narmada. He built a palace at this place and the waters of the fountain were provided to the baths of the palace. The river can be seen at a distance, as a silvery shimmering line in the Nimar plains, from the palace. Bazbahadur was later defeated in a battle and fled from the battle field. Roopmati committed suicide after consuming poison. The balladeers of Malwa still tell you their story.

Due to their isolation from other Gaelic-speaking communities, these East Sutherland villages presented a good opportunity to study language death. Dorian's study is possibly the longest such study in the field. She is considered \\"a prime authority\\" on language death. Language Death: The Life Cycle of a Scottish Gaelic Dialect, her study into the decline of Gaelic in East Sutherland, is considered \\"the first major monograph\\" on language death. According to linguist Joan Argenter, Dorian's name \\"is well known to scholars working in\\" several areas of linguistics. Life According to the 2001 census, between 2% and 4% of the population of East Sutherland spoke Gaelic. Nancy Dorian was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey in 1936. She studied German at the Connecticut College for Women and graduated summa cum laude in 1958. She received an MA (1961) and PhD (1965) from the University of Michigan and taught linguistics and German at Bryn Mawr College from 1965 to 1989, and also taught at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Kiel. Dorian is now a professor emeritus at Bryn Mawr. She is a Unitarian Universalist; her hymn Dear Weaver of our Lives' Design won a prize for celebrating feminine imagery of the divine. Dorian first noticed the Gaelic language while conducting fieldwork for the Linguistic Survey of Scotland in 1963. Noting that a declining localized speech form offered a chance to find out what sorts of changes took place as a speech form passed out of use, she began a long- term study of variation and change in East Sutherland Gaelic. When Dorian started studying the dialect, there were still more than 200 speakers in Brora, Golspie and Embo, including 105 in Embo, where they were more than a third of the population. Although traditional practice calls for anthropologists to change fieldwork settings, health challenges led Dorian to continue study of East Sutherland language development, a situation that had the beneficial side effect of producing a study of unprecedented scope and continuity. Previous researchers had focused on the NORM (non-mobile old rural male) speakers, who had more conservative language, at the expense of the wider speech community. She coined the term \\"semi-speaker\\" for those, mostly from the younger generations, who could speak Gaelic but imperfectly. Her attention to the way that speech competence develops differently in endangered and obsolete languages led socio-linguists to take an interest in understanding different speaker types and their relations to the process of language shift and language shift reversal. Dorian criticized researchers who focused narrowly on single speakers, which conveniently ignored the variation between speakers. Her book The Tyranny of Tide: An Oral History of the East Sutherland Fisherfolk blurred the lines between linguistics and ethnology, revealing how these fields help illuminate and complement each other. Notable works Language Death: The Life Cycle of a Scottish Gaelic Dialect (1981) Dorian published sixteen years of research on East Sutherland Gaelic as Language Death: The Life Cycle of a Scottish Gaelic Dialect. According to a review by Wolfgang U. Dressler, it was \\"the first major monograph\\" on language death. In the view of Professor Tracy Harris and Suzanne Romaine, it was the most comprehensive work on the subject that had been published; Harris also stated that it was \\"a great contribution to the field of linguistics\\". Dressler wrote that \\"[i]t would take too long to describe all the praiseworthy aspects of this book\\", and that it was \\"indispensable\\" to scholars of language death. Romaine highlighted the multidisciplinary perspective with which Dorian had approached her work, producing a book that would appeal to ethnographers, sociologists, Celtic scholars, historians of Scotland, and a wide range of linguists, including those specializing in sociolinguistics, historical linguistics, and syntax. Dorian identified some counterintuitive ways in which language shift was functioning in East Sutherland, noting that the Gaelic language was able to adapt to modern life even while becoming moribund. No diglossia developed, because speakers were able to borrow words from English and apply them to any discussion, even for highly technical topics. She was able to classify speakers as \\"older fluent speakers\\", \\"younger fluent speakers\\", and \\"semi- speakers\\", describing the linguistic differences between each speaker type. Her finding that the socioeconomically homogeonous community was characterized by a high degree of variation between speakers was later elaborated in her 2010 book Investigating Variation: The Effects of Social Organization and Social Setting. Certain types of syntactic distinctions, such as grammatical gender, case markings, and the two passive constructions, were lost gradually, rather than erased wholesale, as some theoreticians had predicted. Dorian did not find the same types of linguistic changes which were thought to mark endangered languages. She postulated that the type of change in endangered languages was the same as in healthy languages, but the rate of change was greatly accelerated; the defining features of an endangered language were sociolinguistic rather than structural. Her research showed that the exclusion of Gaelic from the school curriculum was a major factor in its decline, because it reduced the number of opportunities to use Gaelic and cemented its lower status and \\"usefulness\\" in the eyes of the community. Another important factor, Dorian found, was the presence of prosperous English-speaking incomers which caused the poorer Gaelic speakers to connect the English language with economic success. Later research showed that the features that Dorian identified for Sutherland Gaelic's decline also applied to many other obsolescent languages. Investigating Obsolescence: Studies in Language Contraction and Death (1989) Dorian was inspired to organize this collection of essays when she realized that there were no conferences or journals dedicated to the study of language death, where scholars in the field could share ideas. The book was described by Dorian as a \\"stepping stone\\" to future research into language death. By examining 37 languages and dialects, the authors of essays contributed to the availability of information on specific minority languages. At the same time, the different methodologies used help other researchers learn more about endangered language research. The essays elucidated how second-language learner methodologies could be applied to the study of heritage speakers of endangered languages for whom the language is not their primary mode of communication, one of Dorian's main goals for the collection. In addition, the book was described by Carl Blyth as a \\"milestone\\" because it \\"establishes a more coherent agenda in a disparate and still emerging field\\". Investigating Obsolescence \\"undoubtedly compares to other major collections of sociolinguistic essays\\", according to Emanuel Drechsel. Small-Language Fates and Prospects: Lessons of persistence and Change from Endangered Languages (2014) Within this book Dorian primary focus of study is the fishing towns Brora, Golspie, and Embo located on the highland northeast coast and the transformation of Gaelic dialect in these towns. Dorian notes that on her arrival that many people where bilingual in Gaelic and English this led to further documentation in linguistic changes such as speech patterns and linguistic changes as well as Gaelic speaker's skill and the overall reductions in proficiency. Dorian analyzes language ideology and the importance of its contribution in language shift, she argues that it is important to analyze the speakers range and ability to utilize the Gaelic language. Dorian concludes this book with notes on field work and the methodologies of working within this community when you are positioned as an outsider and utilizes her decades worth of work to provide an in-depth view of Gaelic language transformation. According to a review by linguist Lenore A. Grenoble the most striking thing about the book is it has relevance in its field today considering the book spans decades worth of work. As well anthropologist Emily McEwan-Fujita's review, comments on its value as a resource for students and scholars. Grenoble also highlights the usefulness of publishing a book of these collections that allows for easier access where tracking down older articles may be difficult. Legacy Carl Blyth wrote in 1994 that Dorian \\"deserves foremost credit for consistently drawing the attention of linguists and anthropologists to the importance of endangered languages\\". In 2005, Dorian was the subject of a documentary that aired on BBC Alba: \\"Mar a Chunnaic Mise: Nancy Dorian agus a' Gh√†idhlig\\" (\\"As I saw it: Nancy Dorian and Gaelic\\"). The documentary focused on her work on East Sutherland Gaelic. In 2012 Dorian was awarded the Kenneth L. Hale Award by the Linguistic Society of America, an award which recognizes scholars for work on endangered or extinct languages. Dorian's award credited her for \\"research on Scots Gaelic that spans a period of almost fifty years‚Äîperhaps the most sustained record of research on any endangered language; and for her effective advocacy for the cause of endangered language preservation and revitalization. Hers was one of the earliest and is still one of the most prominent voices raised in support of endangered languages.\\" Dorian received an honorary degree from Glasgow University in 2015.

Follistatin is an autocrine glycoprotein that is expressed in nearly all tissues of higher animals. Its primary function is the binding and bioneutralization of members of the TGF-Œ≤ superfamily, with a particular focus on activin, a paracrine hormone. An earlier name for the same protein was FSH-suppressing protein (FSP). At the time of its initial isolation from follicular fluid, it was found to inhibit the anterior pituitary's secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).  Biochemistry  Follistatin is part of the inhibin-activin-follistatin axis. Currently there are three reported isoforms, FS-288, FS-300, and FS-315. Two, FS-288 and FS-315, are known to be created by alternative splicing of the primary mRNA transcript. FS-300 (porcine follistatin) is thought to be the product of posttranslational modification via truncation of the C-terminal domain from the primary amino-acid chain. Although FS is ubiquitous its highest concentration has been found to be in the female ovary, followed by the skin. The activin-binding protein follistatin is produced by folliculostellate (FS) cells of the anterior pituitary. FS cells make numerous contacts with the classical endocrine cells of the anterior pituitary including gonadotrophs. In the tissues activin has a strong role in cellular proliferation, thereby making follistatin the safeguard against uncontrolled cellular proliferation and also allowing it to function as an instrument of cellular differentiation. Both of these roles are vital in tissue rebuilding and repair, and may account for follistatin's high presence in the skin. In the blood, activin and follistatin are both known to be involved in the inflammatory response following tissue injury or pathogenic incursion. The source of follistatin in circulating blood plasma has yet to be determined, but due to its autocrine nature speculation suggests the endothelial cells lining all blood vessels, or the macrophages and monocytes also circulating within the whole blood, may be sources. Follistatin is involved in the development of the embryo. It has inhibitory action on bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs); BMPs induce the ectoderm to become epidermal ectoderm. Inhibition of BMPs allows neuroectoderm to arise from ectoderm, a process which eventually forms the neural plate. Other inhibitors involved in this process are noggin and chordin. Follistatin and BMPs are also known to play a role in folliculogenesis within the ovary. The main role of follistatin in the oestrus/menstrus ovary, so far, appears to be progression of the follicle from early antral to antral/dominant, and importantly the promotion of cellular differentiation of the estrogen producing granulosa cells (GC) of the dominant follicle into the progesterone producing large lutein cells (LLC) of the corpus luteum. Clinical significance Follistatin is being studied for its role in regulation of muscle growth in mice, as an antagonist to myostatin (also known as GDF-8, a TGF superfamily member) which inhibits excessive muscle growth. Lee & McPherron demonstrated that inhibition of GDF-8, either by genetic elimination (knockout mice) or by increasing the amount of follistatin, resulted in greatly increased muscle mass. In 2009, research with macaque monkeys demonstrated that regulating follistatin via gene therapy also resulted in muscle growth and increases in strength. This research paves the way for human clinical trials, which are hoped to begin in the summer of 2010 on Inclusion body myositis. A study has also shown that increased levels of follistatin, by leading to increased muscle mass of certain core muscular groups, can increase life expectancy in cases of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in animal models. It is also being investigated for its involvement in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), though there is debate as to its direct role in this infertility disease.

Cherokee's owner and manager is Bruce Robb. In his autobiography, Beatles producer George Martin dubbed Cherokee Studios the best studio in America. In the early seventies, the Robb Brothers founded the original Cherokee Studios, first located in the countryside at a ranch in Chatsworth, and then on Fairfax Avenue in Hollywood. The noted studio was owned and operated by the award-winning producer/engineers and brothers - Dee, Joe and Bruce Robb, who had started their careers as performers in the 1960s as a Midwest-based folk rock band called The Robbs. Their manager was Con Merten. They switched to record production, and by the mid-seventies, with albums such as Pretzel Logic and Station to Station the studio had made its name. At the peak of its success, Cherokee housed five studios at the Fairfax location and an additional three studios at a satellite location acquired on Beverly Drive (formerly Lion Share/ABC Dunhill Records).  History  The Robb family lived out in Wisconsin. The three brothers had a band called \\"The Robbs\\". Circa 1962/63, Dick Clark discovered the band when they were the opening act at the ‚ÄúSummer Caravan of Stars‚Äù in Wisconsin and invited them to continue on with the ‚ÄúCaravan‚Äù tour as essentially the house band. They performed as the opening act, then acted as the band of various other major acts of the time, such as: Jerry Lee Lewis, Dion, The Shirelles, Del Shannon, Brian Hyland, The Everly Brothers, Bobby Vee, Bobby Vinton, Freddy Cannon, Gene Pitney, etc. Circa 1964, The Robbs (now with new drummer ‚Äúcousin‚Äù Craig Robb) crashed Clark‚Äôs ‚ÄúBattle of the Bands‚Äù in Chicago at the ‚ÄúYoung World‚Äôs Fair‚Äù where they won and played the opening day to a 16,000 seat arena. That success caused Clark to keep them for the 10-day fair, where they also shot their first episode of his TV show, ‚ÄúWhere the Action Is.‚Äù The ‚ÄúAction‚Äù appearance led to an invitation to join the show as regulars in California, which they did becoming the most publicized band in America for that year on TV in 1965/66. (All the popular teen magazines featured The Robbs alongside The Beatles, The Beach Boys, and all the major bands of the era.) After logging time across the country as a band, The Robbs had become acquainted with just about every unwelcome situation typical of the life of a touring musician at the time. Together with their manager, Con Merten, they relocated to Los Angeles from the Chicago/Milwaukee area to focus more on producing and managing, rather than on performing. Their ideas focused on making the studio a creative space designed for musicians and engineers. As an independent recording studio, not owned by a record or film company, Cherokee was unusual in the U.S. at the time, though not unique - Jimi Hendrix' Electric Lady Studios, opened in 1970, had been constructed along similar ideas and was operated by itself, not by a major company. Within the next couple of years, a fortuitous break presented itself when the MGM Records‚Äô studio space in Fairfax came on the market. The new opportunity arrived not a moment too soon, for the brothers had been locked out of their studio barn after a Sheriff's bust for operating \\"an illegal home studio.\\" Without hesitation, they made the purchase and commenced overhauling their new studio by hand with George Augspurger-designed acoustics, state-of-the-art equipment and, once more, attention to every musician-client detail. The Robbs and Merten, with their new Cherokee Studios, maintained their credo, and the clients described it as \\"the vibe\\" ‚Äì an artist-friendly atmosphere that could be felt as soon as one walked in the door. Their first big hit there was Steely Dan's Pretzel Logic. Cherokee closed the location on Fairfax Ave., Aug 31, 2007. The last album recorded at Cherokee was Out of the Wilderness from Robert Bradley's Blackwater Surprise. The studio closed to make way for a new building. Under the direction of a leading green developer, the site was to become the Lofts @ Cherokee Studios ‚Äì a Green LEED Platinum Live/Work complex offering professional recording studios in select units designed by Cherokee owner Bruce Robb. However that did not carry out as planned. The original developers went into foreclosure in 2008. New owners purchased the property and have had no contact or relationship with Bruce Robb and or Cherokee Studios.  Currently  In late August 2011, the official website announced \\"New Studio Coming to Hollywood\\". As of 2020 Cherokee Studios has a new location on Melrose Ave. Catty corner to Raleigh studios and across the street from Paramount Film Studios. The new studio location was built in collaboration with George Augsberger and Bruce Robb. The studio still boasts the Cherokee/Trident 48 Channel, 24 bus, 24 monitor channel A-range console as well as large tracking space that can hold up to 40 string players comfortably. Of the new studio and location, it has been said the new location is a continuation of the Cherokee tradition, while going above and beyond.

Grahamstown went on to become a military, administrative, judicial and educational centre for its surrounding region. Family origins Graham was born in Dundee, Scotland. He was the second son of Robert Graham, the last laird of the demesne of Fintry and 12th representative of the Grahams of Fintry in Forfarshire, Scotland. Later in life, John became the thirteenth representative of the Fintry Grahams following the death of his elder brother in 1799 and his father in 1816. At the age of 16, Graham was commissioned in the British Army, joining the 90th Regiment of Foot, which had been raised in 1794 by his kinsman, Thomas Graham of Balgowan (later Lord Lynedoch). Two expeditions to France in the late-1790s were followed by an appointment as aide-de-camp to the Earl of Chatham, who Graham served in the Netherlands. After three years on Guernsey with his regiment, Graham was sent to Ireland in 1803 and became assistant quartermaster-general. In January 1806, Graham was promoted to the rank of Major in the 93rd Regiment of Foot, in which capacity he took part in the Battle of Blaauwberg, helping Great Britain to re-occupy the Cape of South Africa. Rapid promotion to Lieutenant Colonel led to him being given charge of the Cape Regiment, based at Wynberg, which Graham trained as light infantry capable of delivering outstanding performance in wooded terrain. The founding of Grahamstown In 1811, Graham and his corps was sent with British regulars and Boer commandos from Swellendam, Graaff-Reinet and Uitenhage to undertake the task which was to define his military career: clearing around 20,000 Xhosa people led by Ndlambe ka Rharhabe. The Xhosa had settled in the Zuurveld (later called Albany), a district between the Bushman's and Fish rivers, which lay beyond the Cape Colony's frontiers. The Zuurveld was mistakenly assumed by the British to be part of the colony as they misread the frontier laid down by Governor Joachim van Plettenberg in 1778. The British campaign to push the Xhosa residents from the Eastern frontier was defined by Graham's plan to use \\"A proper degree of terror.\\" The subsequent battle included the indiscriminate shooting of women and other civilians, as well as destruction of crops. By 1812 Graham's task was complete, and so on the deserted loan farm De Rietfontein, he established Graham‚Äôs Town as Zuurveld's central military post, with a string of linked forts along the Fish River. The same year he returned to England on leave of absence then accompanied his cousin Thomas to Holland as his aide-de-camp and private military secretary. Graham died in Wynberg on 13 March 1821. He was buried in the Somerset Road Cemetery. This was the principal graveyard in Cape Town until 1886. Before the levelling of the Somerset Road Cemetery and building started on the site in about 1922, a number of inscribed stones were lifted from their graves and deposited at the Woltemade cemetery at Maitland which had been opened as Cape Town‚Äôs principal graveyard in 1886. His tombstone lies there today and a window was erected to his memory in St Saviour‚Äôs Church, Claremont, in about 1931. In 1912, a monument was erected in High Street, Grahamstown, on the site of the thorn tree where Graham had made the decision to establish the settlement. Family On 24July 1812, Graham married Johanna Catharina Cloete (1790-1843), a descendant of Jacob Klute (or Cloete) of Westerford, the first permanent settler at the Cape. Along with three daughters (Johanna-Catharina, Elizabeth-Margaret and Isabella-Ann), the couple had a son, Robert, who became civil commissioner of Albany. Descendants Of Graham's grandsons, two were knighted, one as Secretary of Law of the Cape Colony, the other Judge President of the Eastern Districts Court in Grahamstown.

It is situated on the river Tollense, 15 km north of Neubrandenburg. Until 1939 the city's name was Treptow an der Tollense. History The origins of the town go back to a Slavic settlement that grew up around a fortress located on a small hill, where the town church lies today. The name Treptow is mentioned for the first time in 1175, in reference to the establishment of a monastery on the site, which however later moved to Verchen. The present town was most probably founded in the early 13th century, and is referred to as a \\"civitas\\", i.e. Latin for \\"city\\", in 1245. In 1282, a document confirms that the town was ruled by L√ºbeck law. The medieval town had three churches, of which only one survives, as well as a medieval hospital and a system of double defensive walls built before 1360. The town has suffered much destruction through fire and war during the centuries, and in 1743 the town walls were almost completely removed. Two city gates from c. 1450 still survive; the Brandenburger Torturm and the Deminner Torturm. Of the latter, only the ground floor remains, with additions and alterations made in the 19th century.

It is situated about east of Berlin. History Altlandsberg was first mentioned in a 1230 deed, it was located at the site of a former Slavic (Sprevane) settlement. The area then was resettled in the course of the German Ostsiedlung, promoted both by the Ascanian Margraves of Brandenburg and the rivaling Margraves of Meissen from the House of Wettin. The town's name may refer to Saxon Landsberg Castle and therefore indicate an establishment by the Wettins. In 1245 the tensions rose to an armed conflict, in which the Ascanians maintained their grounds. From that time on Altlandsberg remained with Brandenburg. The city was laid out at the behest of the Ascanian rulers, their successor Margrave Louis I from the Bavarian House of Wittelsbach even established a monastery of the Servite Order in 1335, which was dissolved during the Protestant Reformation. Altlandsberg was devastated by the Hussites in 1432, it was affected by several town fires and plague epidemics in the 16th century. The medieval town was burnt down completely in 1632 during the Thirty Years' War. A hoard of 7450 gold and silver coins dating from the 14th and early 15th century was discovered in the grounds of the former manor in late 2016. The dates suggest that it was buried in order to protect it during the Hussite wars. It is the largest hitherto found in the state of Brandenburg, and is now being examined in the archeological museum in Brandenburg an der Havel.

The inhabitants of the village are mostly native to Hong Kong. They are mainly from the 'Ng' and 'Chan' families, with the current village head being a 'Ng'. A British Law passed in 1895 declared inhabitants of various villages native to the territory and granted them special land, burial and inheritance rights. However, as land becomes more scarce and expensive, many people are challenging this old law. The old Tseung Kwan O dialect is also becoming a thing of the past as new generations no longer know how to speak their ancestor's tongue. Tseung Kwan O Village used to be a small fishing and horticultural village. Dynamite and nets were often the normal tools for fishing and simple rope traps were used to trap owls for dried meat.

It is a well-known breakfast food in the states on the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia (Terengganu, Kelantan, parts of Pahang and eastern Johor), southern Thai Malay provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat and across the Indonesian border in Natuna and Anambas, Riau Islands. The most famous nasi dagang comes from Tumpat in Kelantan and Kampung Ladang in Kuala Terengganu. Ingredients Nasi Dagang as served in Prince of Songkla University in Pattani, Thailand. The Patani-Malay styled Nasi Dagang is commonly served with Telur pindang. Nasi (Rice) The combination of fenugreek seeds and coconut milk gives nasi dagang its unique flavour and fragrance. The rice may first be soaked in water for several hours to soften it. It is then mixed with thick coconut milk, sliced shallots, lemongrass and fenugreek seeds. The rice is steamed until cooked. It may also be steamed twice, where more coconut milk is added when it is half-cooked. Then the rice is steamed again until cooked. This method ensures a more creamy finish to the rice. Kari Ikan (Fish Curry) This accompanying dish is only specially prepared for nasi dagang and is sometimes locally called gulai darat. This curry the fish is cooked in is not an Indian-style curry powder but a Malay- style curry, i.e., coconut milk mixed with traditional Malay spices such as lemon grass, galangal, chilli paste, and turmeric. Tuna is the standard choice of fish but other fish can be used as well, such as tenggiri.Growing Up in Trengganu, By Awang Goneng Chicken and prawns are also used sometimes; however, the gulai darat is prepared slightly differently. Kelapa Goreng (Fried Coconut) Kelapa Parut is freshly shaved, mixed with sliced shallots and fried until golden brown. Hard-boiled eggs Hard boiled eggs are cut into four or eight slices. Vegetable pickle The vegetable is pickled in rice vinegar and sugar. The vegetables commonly used are cucumber, chilli and carrots. Sambal Chilli sambal can sometimes be included. Telur pindang Telur pindang, herb-boiled eggs, commonly paired with Nasi dagang among the Malay community in Thailand (Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani). Gulai Lemak Ikan Salai Smoked fish cooked with spicy and creamy gravy, a side dish usually being accompanied with Nasi Dagang in Natuna and Anambas Islands, Indonesia. Variants The Terengganu version uses the normal white rice, while the Kelantanese variety uses a type of rice locally called 'beras nasi dagang', which is a type of wild rice that has a light purple colour and a little glutinous. The Terengganuan version is also much simpler, eaten only with the fish curry (sometimes with belimbing buluh added) and pickles. Outside the Malaysian border, it is a staple breakfast in the deep south of Thailand (Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat), the nasi dagang of southern Thailand features a closer version with the special rice used in Kelantan. While across the South China Sea, the Nasi dagang in Natuna & Anambas attributed a similar gurai (gravy) with the Terangganese version of the rice, although the rice for the Natuna-Anambas version of Nasi Dagang was cooked with coconut milk.

It is the most common glaucoma surgery performed and allows drainage of aqueous humor from within the eye to underneath the conjunctiva where it is absorbed. This outpatient procedure was most commonly performed under monitored anesthesia care using a retrobulbar block or peribulbar block or a combination of topical and subtenon (Tenon's capsule) anesthesia. Due to the higher risks associated with bulbar blocks, topical analgesia with mild sedation is becoming more common. Rarely general anesthesia will be used, in patients with an inability to cooperate during surgery.  Procedure  An initial pocket is created under the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule and the wound bed is treated for several seconds to minutes with mitomycin C (MMC, 0.5‚Äì0.2 mg/ml) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, 50 mg/ml) soaked sponges. These chemotherapeutics help to prevent failure of the filter bleb from scarring by inhibiting fibroblast proliferation. Alternatively, non-chemotherapeutic adjuvants can be implemented to prevent super scarring by wound modulation, such as the ologen collagen matrix implant. Some surgeons prefer \\"fornix-based\\" conjunctival incisions while others use \\"limbus-based\\" construction at the corneoscleral junction which may allow easier access in eyes with deep sulci. A partial thickness flap with its base at the corneoscleral junction is then made in the sclera after careful cauterization of the flap area, and a window opening is created under the flap with a Kelly-punch to remove a portion of the sclera, Schlemm's canal and the trabecular meshwork to enter the anterior chamber. Because of the fluid egress the iris will partially prolapse through the sclerostomy and is usually therefore grasped to perform an excision called iridectomy. This iridectomy will prevent future blockage of the sclerostomy. The scleral flap is then sutured loosely back in place with several sutures. The conjunctiva is closed in a watertight fashion at the end of the procedure.  Mechanism  Intraocular pressure may be lowered by allowing drainage of aqueous humor from within the eye to the following routes: (1) filtration through the sclerostomy around the margins of the scleral flap into the filtering bleb that forms underneath the conjunctiva, (2) filtration through outlet channels in the scleral flap to underneath the conjunctiva, (3) filtration through connective tissue of the scleral flap to underneath the conjunctiva. into cut ends of Schlemm's canal, (4) aqueous flow into cut ends of Schlemm's canal into collector channels and episcleral veins and (5) into a cyclodialysis cleft between the ciliary body and the sclera if tissue is dissected posterior to the scleral spur.  Postoperative care  Glaucoma medications are usually discontinued to improve aqueous humor flow to the bleb. Topical medications consist typically of antibiotic drops four times per day and anti-inflammatory therapy e.g. with prednisolone drops every two hours. A shield is applied to cover the eye until anesthesia has worn off (that also anesthetizes the optic nerve) and vision resumes. Patients are instructed to call immediately for pain that cannot be controlled with over the counter pain medication or if vision decreases, to not rub the eye and to wear the shield at night for several days after surgery. If 5-FU was used during surgery or if no anti- fibrotic agent was applied, 5 mg 5-FU daily can be injected in the 7‚Äì14 postoperative days. In the following days to weeks sutures that hold the scleral flap down can be cut by laser suture lysis to titrate the intraocular pressure down by improving outflow. In laser suture lysis a red light laser and a contact lens are used to penetrate noninvasively the overlying conjunctiva and cut the black nylon suture. Some surgeons prefer adjustable flap sutures during the trabeculectomy that can be loosened later on with forceps in a slit lamp office procedure.  Postoperative challenges  *Flat bleb ‚Äì will fail if not formed in first postoperative days; if early scarring is cause, subconjunctival 5-FU injections or wound modulation with ologen collagen matrix can prevent conjunctiva from adhering down the wound bed. *Bleb leak ‚Äì may cause flat bleb; leaking blebs can be revised with the use of ologen collagen matrix or bandage contact lens for several days followed by leak repair if necessary *Flat anterior chamber ‚Äì reform to prevent corneal decompensation; can often be done in the office at the slit lamp with viscoelastics used in cataract surgery *Blebitis ‚Äì if infectious can progress to devastating endophthalmitis *Suprachoroidal hemorrhage ‚Äì rupture of long posterior ciliary artery from progressive stretching with progressive serous choroidal detachment; usually occurs several days after trabeculectomy with acute pain often while straining *Hypotony ‚Äì wound revision *Cataract formation ‚Äì cataract surgery if visually significant *Small encapsulated bleb ‚Äì injection of subconjunctival MMC and lidocaine can balloon up adjacent conjunctiva followed by needle incision of the bleb side and bleb extension; alternatively or together, the use of biodegradable spacer or ologen collagen matrix implant may be implemented.  Conclusion  Trabeculectomy is the most common invasive glaucoma surgery. It is highly effective in the treatment of advanced glaucoma as demonstrated in major glaucoma studies. Even if a prior trabeculectomy has failed a second trabeculectomy can be performed at a different site. If scarring is the main reason, anti-fibrotic and anti- inflammatory therapy has to be intensified in the second procedure. Alternatively, insertion of a glaucoma valve device can be used.  Modifications of trabeculectomy  Trabeculectomy has undergone numerous modifications, e.g. filtering trepanotrabeculectomy (TTE) is a modification of the operation after J. Fronimopoulos. A triangular scleral flap is created which is approximately one-half as thick as the sclera. Trepanation is performed with a 2 mm trephine. The scleral edge of the trepanation opening is heat-cauterized. Additional deep scleral dissection can also be performed in the scleral bed with trabeculectomy, first introduced by T. Dada et al.; deep scleral excision is performed in non-penetrating filtering surgeries but not traditionally in trabeculectomy. The space created from the deep scleral dissection is proposed to accommodate certain biocompatible spacer or devices in order to prevent subscleral fibrosis and to maintain good filtering results in this modified operation. Various adjunctive devices have been used with trabeculectomy, to maintain drainage of aqueous humor and to maintain the patency of bleb. There is low-quality evidence that usage of Ex-PRESS implant, a miniature stainless steel shunt, and human amniotic membrane as adjuncts with trabeculectomy have been associated with reduced intraocular pressure in patients after a one-year follow-up, compared to standard trabeculectomy.  Research  A Cochrane review sought to compare the effectiveness of fornix- based versus limbal-based conjunctival flaps for patients undergoing trabeculectomy. There were no statistically significant differences between the two procedures in regards to surgery failure rate, mean intraocular pressure at follow-up, and postoperative complications. Currently, there are no published trials which compare the efficacy and safety of ab interno trabeculectomy with Trabectome with other procedures for treating glaucoma.

History  Manglaur is an old place of North Hind which has its own recognition. At one side where it is a matter of pride being a historical place. On the other hand, it bears such good people who are owner of unlimited assets. History is witness that its name is on the basis of its bearer whose name was Mangal Sen. For a long time it was the capital of Mangal Sen. whose symbol is present even today. There is also an evidence from Aaine Akbar (author Abul Fajal), too, that it was a historical place. Manglaur is a historical town where a fort made of brick is present which was built at the time of king Vikramaditya and it was under the control of Brahmenes and Badgujers.

It runs east-west in the center of the greater urban area and is long, and it has up to 5 lanes in each direction. It was named after Chile's founding father Bernardo O'Higgins. It was originally a branch of the Mapocho River. History The avenue is located on the former stream bed of a branch of the Mapocho River, which was drying up between 1560 and 1580. Such landforms were known by the Spaniards as Ca√±adas, and from there the origin of its initial name of Ca√±ada. For many decades it was used as a landfill site, until it was converted into a boulevard by Bernardo O'Higgins during the first years of independence of the country and was named as Alameda de las Delicias. Description Alameda Avenue originates immediately west of the Plaza Baquedano, as a continuation of Providencia Avenue, and runs in a generally southwesterly direction until its junction with Chile Route 68. The south section of the initial stretch of the avenue is dominated by a cluster of tower blocks called Remodelaci√≥n San Borja. On the opposite side of the Alameda, the city blocks are characterized by a continuous building frontage. This urban design is broken by the Centro Cultural Gabriela Mistral. The corner of the Alameda and Portugal Avenue is home to the headquarters of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. Heading west, the avenue skirts the southern edge of the Cerro Santa Luc√≠a. The following stretch of the Alameda consists of almost unbroken blocks of mostly office and commercial buildings interspersed with some historical buildings, including the Biblioteca Nacional de Chile, San Francisco Church, Club de la Uni√≥n and behind it the building housing the Santiago Stock Exchange, as well as the old building serving as headquarters for the University of Chile, which faces the Paseo Ahumada. West of the just mentioned street and a half block north of the Alameda is located the Edificio Arizt√≠a. West of San Francisco Church, the Alameda's median widens to accommodate a park. The avenue bisects a large rectangular area lined with walls of government buildings, whose core portion is home to the Palacio de la Moneda. West of Amun√°tegui Street stands the Torre Entel, a landmark communication tower. The Norte-Sur axis of the Autopista Central passes underneath Alameda. From here the average height of the buildings decreases significantly. Between Brasil Avenue and Cumming Avenue, it borders the Barrio Concha y Toro. Leaving the central district at Matucana Avenue, the Alameda enters into Estaci√≥n Central. The Santiago Estaci√≥n Central railway station and the main campus of the University of Santiago are located here. Crossing Las Rejas Avenue, the avenue forms the boundary between Estaci√≥n Central to the south and Lo Prado to the north. The Alameda terminates at a partial Y interchange. Monuments Downtown. La Alameda's principal monuments are dedicated to the military heroes in Chile's history. Near the La Moneda Palace are the statues of Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, Manuel Bulnes Prieto, and Bernardo O'Higgins. Near the intersection of the Autopista Central and La Alameda, there is erected the statue to the heroes of the Battle of La Concepci√≥n. A beautiful mosaic was constructed at the edge of Santa Luc√≠a Hill in honor of the poet Gabriela Mistral; there are also dozens of other monuments to persons of national and international importance along the central floe of La Alameda.

The attraction consisted of a barrel with a track inside for cars to ride freewheeling. The cars were held onto the drum by a rail and floating clamp system. As the drum would spin, the single person cars would follow the track and eventually begin to go upside down. The drum steadily increased its speed and the cars would let it roll beneath their wheels as they followed the track. The cars' brakes were then applied causing them to quickly accelerate up to the speed of the drum's surface, around 30 mph. The operator of Flying Cars would spin the drum for two minutes and then release the brakes causing the cars to come to a complete stop while the drum slowed to a halt. In 1966 the four car ride overturned on the first embankment, seriously injuring several riders. The attraction was shut down due to safety concerns.

The municipality at Mangrulpir is the youngest in the district having been established as late as 1959. The antiquity of the region round Mangrulpir goes back to two thousand years. This has been shown by a large hoard of Satavahana coins numbering more than 1.500 discovered in 1939 at Tarhala, a village about 7 miles north by west of Mangrulpir. The coins are of potin, round in shape, and have on the obverse (front side) the figure of an elephant with the trunk uplifted with the name of the Satavahana king who issued it round the edge and the Ujjain symbol (two dumbbells placed al right tingles, one across the other, on the reverse (back side). The hoard contained coins of some kings such as Kumbha Satakami, Karna Satakarni etc. who became known for the first time. They flourished in the early centuries of the Christian era. The hoard has been published by Dr. Mirashi, of the Nagpur University. Objects of Interest There are historic places of interest such as Dargah of Hazrat Sayyad Ahmad Kabeer and other Muslim saints and peers. The town is called Mangrulpir on account of these associations. The old Akola District Gazetteer published in 1910 states, 'The actual tomb is on the top of a small hill, on which are also other buildings connected with it, while below are two large courtyards containing rooms for the accommodation of pilgrims; the whole is surrounded by a massive stone wall with nine bastions and four gates, forming a large fortification. Local tradition relates that Hazrat Sayyad Ahmad Kabeer, also called as Dada Hayat Qalandar, came from Tus in Arabia in one of the Fourteen Hundred Palanquins, 652 of which actually halted at Mangrul; it is added, however, that he may have come along with the Emperor Aurangzeb, and that the time may have been 700 years ago.' The fair is attended by about 25.000 people. The inam and the jahagir have been abolished since 1948 and now it gets a Government grant of Rs. 1,170 per annum. It owns about 200 acres of land and gets an annual income of about Rs. 2,000 from the same besides rental 'income of Rs. 2,000 per annum. There is also a temple dedicated to Birbalnath Maharaj who hailed from Punjab and took sumadhi on February 4, 1928 owns 25 acres of land. An annual fair is held in honour of Birbalnath Maharaj on Magha Shuddna 14-January‚ÄìFebruary. About 10 to, 12 thousand people assemble at the time of the fair. Many other objects of interest in the town as they then existed are described in the Akola District Gazetteer. The description of the same is reproduced below as many of them have historical importance. \\"The Jama masjid stands just below the tomb, it is a large but not very striking building. Close to the town stands the dargah of Hazrat Shah Aman Sahib, with that of his Murshid Shah Amanullah in the same enclosure. It has an inscription and is of some size, though not on the scale of Dada Hayat Qalandar's Dargha. Amansahib, who came from Sialkot, is of less antiquity than the other and was distinguished by adopting the penance of remaining constantly for 12 years seated on the ground. Finally the Emperor Shah Jahan came to Mangrul, and on his expressing the wish that the fakir should rise Amansahib did so, but with such pain and difficulty that the blood poured from his crippled legs; Shah Jahan then gave him two jagir villages and some inam land. A third dargah, that of Divan haji Shah Muhammad, stands two miles west of Mangrul on a hill called Dhanbaldi, treasure-hill, beside the Bashim road. This saint is said to have been a jamadar in the Nizam's service, having charge of 14 horses, but his date cannot he more definitely fixed. He came from Nasirabad in Khandesh and was greatly pleased with the tomb of Hazrat Dada Hayat Qalandar, a voice from which presently bade him to relinquish all worldly interests and live at the tomb; he did so and the avaliya continued to give him directions from time to time. Thus he went to Mecca and afterwards to Burhanpur, where a saint called Shall Allah Baksh gave him a cup containing the juice of certain herbs, whereby he was purified and became himself an avaliya, again lie was directed to live 50 paces behind the dargah, where he built a mosque and dug two wells, and later to go to the site of his present tomb. While he was building a mosque and a dargah there a Gosain passed and gave him a tin of powder whereby 52 tolas of copper might be turned into the same weight of gold, but Divan Shah put it to one side. The Gosain passed again some years later and seeing the various works completed, thought his magic had been utilised, but the saint first showed him the untouched tin and then caused the Gosain to see the hill composed entirely of gold and silver, whence the present name of Dhanbaldi. Another dargah and several Hindu temples of no particular interest also stand in the town.\\"' See also *Tarhala References Cities and towns in Washim district Talukas in Maharashtra ","title":"Mangrulpir"},{"id":"5801229","text":"Joseph Newman (December 11, 1912 ‚Äì April 15, 1995)Social Security Death Index: Joseph NewmanJoseph Newman; Journalist, 82 was an American journalist and writer from New York City. He worked for the New York Herald Tribune under George Cornish as a Japan correspondent, living in Japan with his wife Mary. Japan During his period of residence in Japan, he made contacts with other foreign residents, journalists and some important personalities linked with the Japanese government, and became known for his in-depth reporting on the local military-political establishment before the outbreak of the Pacific War. He was acquainted with members of the German and Italian communities, and had connections in the Japanese Army and Navy ministries. From these sources he was able to file reports with the American media, later writing the book Goodbye Japan, where he related his experiences there. His knowledge about the regime made him mistrustful of the courteous and amicable words and agreeable speeches that the government produced for overseas consumption via its mouthpiece, Radio Tokyo, or the official press agency, Domei Tsushin. He knew that these \\"agreeable words\\" hid the real intentions of the ruling , which were: *The total defeat of the major powers in the area: United States, Great Britain, France, Dutch Indies and Soviet Union *Total dominion of the West Pacific area *The creation of an Asian political and economic bloc *The extension of Japanese lifestyle, thinking and culture in conquered territories *The expansion of Empire frontiers beyond present territories, including brief description of a large-scale imperial army operation against the Soviet Union in Eastern Siberia,taking advantage of the German attack in European Russia, prior to the attack on Pearl Harbour among the possible future fight with their current allies the Axis Powers for total world dominion Newman thought that if the American people understood the Japanese political-military movements from the Meiji period to the days before December 1941, it could have prevented the Pearl Harbor disaster and the outbreak of the Pacific War. Additionally he countered the statement made by some in the West that Japan was a victim of German Nazi movements, by showing from his observations in the country that Japan had been more aggressive in the Asian mainland that Germany had been in Poland. Exodus When the American State Department ordered all American residents to leave Japan because of hostility toward foreigners, Newman asked his boss for a leave of absence from Tokyo. He suspected he was constantly under police surveillance there. Later, his boss George Cornish gave him leave and Newman left for Yokohama aboard the Tatsuta Maru (one of three N.Y.K. vessels provided by the Japanese government to evacuate the Americans before the outbreak of hostilities). Thanks to his friends in the Japanese government, Newman obtained permission to leave the country, saying that he was taking a holiday in Hawaii. Newman arrived in Honolulu for a month's vacation. He was surprised at the easy access to Pearl Harbor. It was possible for anyone to observe movements and take photographs. He contrasted this with the tight security he had observed in Japan. On 5 December at 12:30 pm, Newman and his wife boarded the luxury vessel SS Lurline for return to New York. At 10:00 am on 7 December the captain announced that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor and advised the passengers of measures to take in the event of Japanese attack on the ship. USSR Joseph Newman was also the chief correspondent for the Herald Tribune in Moscow after the war, and was host to John Steinbeck during his famous trip there.A Russian Journal by John Steinbeck Later life After leaving Moscow, Newman moved to Argentina for several years before moving to New York. just in his period in Buenos Aires, in 1943 he authorized the Editorial Poseidon,Sociedad de Responsabilidad limitada the publication of your book in Spanish under the title \\"Adios al Japon\\"; Eight years later he and his family settled in Washington D.C. where he remained until he died. In 1993, the Asahi Shimbun republished 'Goodbye Japan,' translated into Japanese. They invited Newman to return to Tokyo for an opening ceremony for the book. It was the first time Newman had been in Japan in fifty years. The book is still available in both the United States and Japan today.

The park served as the location for Monty Python's Upper Class Twit of the Year sketch. It had a seated capacity of around 2,500 people, until the stands were demolished in 2002.  History  The opening meeting of the track was on 11 September 1954, the same date that the area became a public park. The running track was originally made of cinder. The field on which the track is situated was originally a polo ground and was compulsorily purchased from the Hurlingham Club after World War Two. A grandstand was built in 1936 to replace an earlier version but it was allowed to become run down in the 1990s and, in spite of strong local opposition, was demolished in 2002. It had a capacity of approximately 2,500 on bench type seating. The stadium has been replaced by a considerably smaller pavilion with no public facilities. The infield is a well maintained grass pitch and is used for either rugby union or football. The track has a straight on the home straight next to the grandstand which extends past the regular start line although the extension has been fenced off. The track was the base of London Athletic Club and the straight was last thought to be used for a race in 1979. A meeting was held with exactly the same schedule of events as the first open championship in 1879 and thus included a 220-yard straight race (200 metres) The Monty Python sketch \\"The 127th Upper Class Twit of the Year Competition from Hurlingham Park\\" was filmed there in 1969.

India census, Manihari had a population of 26,629. Geography The town is located on the banks of the river Ganges where it meets the river Koshi, thus making the town prone to flooding every year. Manihari is a small border town between the states of Bihar and Jharkhand. Sahebganj is the district town of Jharkhand which is 9 km from Manihari (nautical mile distance); there is regular ferry service. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar flagged off the first passenger train on the newly converted Broad gauge (BG) section of Katihar-Manihari in Katihar division of North-East Frontier Railway (NFR) at Katihar station. There are few local trains which run between Manihari and Katihar. The geography of Manihari is unique. The river Ganges (i.e. Ganga) flows eastward up to Manihari and takes a southward turn after Manihari. Thus, Manihari is known as the point of River Ganges's sharp bend leading its eastward water flow to turn to southward water flow. Manihari Ghat Before the Farakka Barrage over the Ganges was constructed, people going to the Darjeeling Hills or North Bengal from Kolkata, used to travel by broad gauge train to Sakrigali Ghat and then cross the Ganges by steamer. On the other side of the river at Manihari Ghat, they used to take a metre gauge train to Siliguri. Once Farakka Barrage became operational in 1975 (the barrage has a broad gauge rail line on it), this route became redundant. There still is a ferry service linking Manihari Ghat with Sahebganj.

Using fragments of audio from a variety of previously recorded sound sources, the project is an experiment in recycled media. Escape Mechanism has taken many forms, since 1997. From solo studio releases and theatrical sound design, to a live ensemble and sound installation, the project is defined by its re-use of sounds found in the broadcast media. Although essentially a studio project, Escape Mechanism experimented briefly (1999 ‚Äì 2001) with live improvisation. Performing under the name Cast of Thousands with Escape Mechanism, the rotating ensemble also worked exclusively with bits and pieces of the media environment, performing at art venues and performances spaces such as The Walker Art Center, the Soap Factory and The First Avenue Main Room. Escape Mechanism has collaborated with artists such as Steev Hise, The Tape-beatles and Wobbly, and mounted sound installations at art galleries such as The Blue Theater, Rosalux Gallery and The Rochester Art Center. Escape Mechanism proudly presents itself as 100% recycled, as every sound found in an Escape Mechanism composition is recycled from a previously recorded source. No original sounds are incorporated; only original juxtapositions. Some Assembly Required Nelson is perhaps best known for his role as host and producer of the nationally syndicated radio program, Some Assembly Required. The show is a weekly exploration of works of appropriation, by artists who use samplers and other audio playback equipment to create original sound collage compositions.

It was intended to reveal the position and intentions of that country just before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Overview At the time, many Americans sincerely believed that Japan was unjustly marked as an aggressor, a nation with friendly intentions to make peace and to help with the progress of Asian neighbors. They also thought that it was a good business partner and a force for the maintenance of order in its sphere of influence. The purpose of the book was to alert the American public to the real Japanese intentions. Synopsis From his experience in Japan, Joseph Newman exposed to the Americans the hidden Japanese plans of conquest and the extremes of Japanese militarism. He presented the actual state of life in Japan during the war, totally different from the beautiful image presented in Japanese propaganda, and through Radio Tokyo or the Domei Tsushin Press Agency. Newman obtained permission from the General Director of \\"New York Herald Tribune\\" George Cornish to use material he had gathered while working in Japan before 1941. The book was printed in New York City in 1942. Detailed synopsis The original edition has 246 pages and is divided into ten chapters. After a preface explaining the intention of the book and giving some comments on Japanese thinking, in the first chapter the author explains in detail the real nature of the Japanese establishment, its history and the real location of political and military power in then nation. The second chapter exposes the Japanese conquest plan. The third chapter talks of the indoctrination of Asian leaders using material from visits Newman made, accompanied by other journalists and with some restrictions, to Chinese occupied lands and Manchukuo. The next two chapters cover the Japanese control of mass media, strict press censorship and the difficulty faced by foreign correspondents and journalists. The next chapter covers difficulties Japanese faced during Sino-Japanese War and pre-war 1941 period before Pearl Harbor strike. In the next two chapters Newman discusses the complicated political infighting and factionalism. The next chapter tells of the growth of local xenophobic action against foreigners, and local political movements and Japanese aggression against Western powers in East Asia. The final chapters refer to the latest political-military local actions, diplomatic movements, the hostility between Japan and United States, the proposal of a Japanese invasion plan against the Soviet Union in Eastern Siberia taking advantage of the German attack on European Russia, the last working days of foreign journalists (including Newman himself) and the evacuation of the last Americans and other foreign residents, just a short time before the Pearl Harbor Attack, and the return to San Francisco via Hawaii. The book is an interesting historical source about political environment and everyday life in the Japanese Empire in the 1940s.

Herbal cigarettes are also used in acting scenes by performers who are non-smokers, or‚Äîas is becoming increasingly common‚Äîwhere anti-smoking legislation prohibits the use of tobacco in public spaces. Herbal cigarettes can carry carcinogens which can have health implications. Construction Nirdosh herb, Herbal Dhoompan cigarettes Paper and filter Herbal cigarettes are most often made using standard-issue rolling papers and cigarette filters. Herbal blend A wide range of consumable products may be used as a filling, in lieu of tobacco. Corn silk and a number of flavorful herbs, such as mint, cinnamon or lemongrass, have been utilized by a wide number of herbal cigarette producers. Other manufacturers have included non-herbs like rose petals or clover leaves. Some use the flavorless bagasse and make the herbal cigarette depend on the flavoring; this is especially common in shisha. Some are made with dried lettuce leaves or shredded cabbage leaves. Toxic chemicals * Tar: The tar level was found at 5.5 mg/cig, which was higher than the package indicated. In South Korea, a study found that tar levels were higher than the tolerance range set by the South Korean tobacco business law. Chinese herbal cigarettes were found to have the same amount of tar as regular cigarettes. * Carbon monoxide (CO): In a South Korean study there was carbon monoxide detected at 12.30 ¬± 0.30 mg/cig. Vegetable based herbal cigarettes can produce carbon monoxide equivalent to regular cigarettes. *Aromatic amines: 4-aminobiphenyl, a group 1 carcinogen, was marginally higher in herbal cigarettes than in regular cigarettes and 1-aminonaphthalene, 2-aminonaphthalene, and 3-aminobiphenyl was lower in herbal cigarettes than in regular cigarettes. *Smoke condensate: The mutagenic aspect of the smoke condensate of herbal cigarettes is similar to regular cigarettes. Health effects Research shows that herbal cigarettes compared with regular cigarettes can be just as harmful in terms of the carcinogens they carry. Dr. John Moore-Gillan, chairman of the British Lung Foundation, states the addictive qualities to herbal cigarettes may be taken out, however other harmful elements remain. A study on Chinese herbal cigarettes found they had about the same amount of carcinogens as regular cigarettes. There are toxic components of the smoke of herbal cigarettes which are similar to regular cigarettes. Aminobiphenyl can cause bladder cancer.

Short term symptoms of CO include headaches, dizziness, irritability and difficulty breathing. Herbal cigarettes in different countries China The Chinese Tobacco industry markets herbal cigarettes as having health benefits, yet scientific studies show there is no difference to peoples' health between Chinese herbal cigarette brands and regular cigarette brands. Chinese cigarette brands are equally as addictive as regular cigarettes, although they are marketed as healthier. Chinese herbal cigarettes are sold in Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, Myanmar, Canada, and Taiwan. People observed in a study showed they smoked more herbal cigarettes than regular cigarettes. Herbal cigarettes started in the 1970s and became popular in the 1990s.

He later moved over to Charles Mintz's Screen Gems studio, and in the late 1930s moved over to the Disney studio. At Disney, Blair animated cartoon short subjects, Mickey Mouse scenes in \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" section of Fantasia (1940), and the hippo-alligator dance in Fantasia's \\"Dance of the Hours\\" sequence. He also did some work on Walt Disney's Pinocchio (1940) and Bambi (1942). Blair left Disney after the 1941 Disney animator's strike, and was hired to work for Tex Avery's unit at MGM. There, he became particularly known for animating the titular female character in Red Hot Riding Hood. \\"Red\\" later re-appeared in more Avery cartoons, including Swing Shift Cinderella, Little Rural Riding Hood, Uncle Tom's Cabana and the Droopy cartoons The Shooting of Dan McGoo and Wild and Woolfy, with animation by Blair. In the late 1940s, Blair teamed with Avery animator Michael Lah to direct several Barney Bear cartoons. Blair continued his career in animation into the 1960s, working on The Flintstones at Hanna- Barbera. He is better known, however, as an author of animation instructional books for Walter Foster Publishing. His first book, Animation, was published in 1948 and originally included images of the MGM & Disney cartoon characters he had animated, who were redrawn to obscure their origins in the second edition of the book.

Education K√µiv attended school in Tartu after the second World War, graduating in the early 1950s with a degree in nuclear physics. K√µiv worked as a scientist and lecturer until 1991. Career as a playwright K√µiv always entertained a fascination with and love for literature. He wrote mostly for personal entertainment until the 1950s, when he became active in Estonian literary circles. His earliest published works were written with friends from these circles. He also wrote under a pseudonym for several years. His first published work was a play called K√º√ºni t√§itmine (Filling the Hay Barn) written as a collaboration between K√µiv (using his pseudonym Jaanus Andreus Nooremb) and Hando Runnel in 1978. In 1999, the play was successfully produced for the first time. K√µiv then wrote two pieces with Vaino Vahing. The first was a play titled Faehlmann. Keskp√§ev. √ïhtuselgus. (Faehlmann. Noon. Evening Clarity.) The two also wrote the dialogue novel Endspiel. Laskumine orgu. (Endspiel. Descent into the Valley.) Just before the end of the decade, K√µiv began to publish works he had previously written for his own amusement under his own name. K√µiv became the most essential Estonian playwright of the 1950s and 1960s. In the early 1990s, K√µiv began to gain fame. In 1991 and 1993, he won the Tuglas short story award for Film and The Life of an Eternal Physicus, respectively. He won the annual Estonian literary award in 1991 for The Meeting. He won the annual Estonian literary award again in 1995 for The Philosopher's Day and Return to Father. K√µiv won the award a third time in 1999 for Scenes From the Hundred Years' War.

The second part of the hall (now known as the West Wing) was opened in 1968 by the then Chancellor of the University of London, HM Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. Later construction included the conversion of Georgian terrace houses on Lansdowne Terrace into flats for postgraduate students, the conversion of similar properties on Guilford Street into two new sets of single and double study- bedrooms (known as House and Ingold), and the construction of X block (pronounced \\"cross-block\\", although room numbers there, e.g. X123, were pronounced \\"ex-one-two...\\") connecting Ingold and the West Wing. The Lansdowne Flats on Guilford Street. The Hall underwent a major refurbishment in 2002-03. The refurbishment saw the demolition of the X block and the construction of a new Central Wing comprising studio flats for postgraduate students. The refurbishment also saw the construction of a new entrance on Lansdowne Terrace (the previous main entrance having been on Brunswick Square), and refurbishment of all facilities and rooms. The Georgian Terrace houses on Lansdowne Terrace and Guilford Street were also refurbished as large family flats. The newly refurbished Hall was reopened in December 2003 by the Chancellor of the University of London, the Princess Royal.

The two teams always work closely together, but have different sets of responsibilities. The management work full-time during office hours, whereas the wardenial staff are part-time members of staff who are either studying or working elsewhere in the University of London. Hall Manager's Team *Hall Manager *Assistant Hall Manager The Hall Manager has overall management responsibility for the Hall‚Äôs buildings, furnishings, and finances. The Hall Manager and their staff are responsible for the provision of catering, maintenance, telephone, Internet, housekeeping, and reception services. They also look after the Hall‚Äôs commercial activities, including conferences, bed & breakfast, and group bookings. Wardenial Team *Warden *Seven Senior Members (Sub-Wardens) The Warden and Senior Members are part- time members of staff resident within the Hall, responsible for student welfare and pastoral care, discipline, re-admissions, Hall community and social life, and out-of-hours emergency cover. The Wardenial team are all experienced academics, teachers, or postgraduate students within the University of London. They are available to offer support and guidance to students, and can help with problems both inside and outside the Hall, including academic difficulties, medical or emotional problems, social concerns, financial worries, and problems with the behaviour of other residents (e.g. noisy neighbours). The Warden and Senior Members oversee the elected residents‚Äô Club Committee, which organises various social and sporting events throughout the year. The Wardenial team all trained as fire marshals, and have first aid training. They participate in an on-call Duty Officer rota covering nights and weekends to deal with any emergencies while the Hall Manager's Office is closed. They can be contacted via reception at any time. Residents' Club Committee The Residents Club Committee is made up 10 elected student residents. The process is based on self nomination, and then election via a first past the post popular vote. Hustings take place the evening before the vote and results are normally released the following afternoon. The Residents' Club Committee is elected in January of each academic year. The Committee organises various social and sporting functions during the year, funded by subscriptions which all residents pay; this income is also used to provide newspapers and magazines for residents' use. The elected members of the Committee can also help represent residents' concerns and suggestions to members of staff. It has become traditional for the Residents' Club Committee to organise certain events every year: *A welcome party in the common room at the beginning of the first term. *A Halloween party on 31 October (or sometimes a Guy Fawkes' party on 5 November). *Decorating the Christmas tree, usually with mulled wine and mince pies for everyone who helps. *A Christmas party, usually on the same night as the eagerly anticipated special Christmas Dinner in the Restaurant (usually with wine, crackers, live music, and carol singing). *A Valentine's party. *A \\"boat party\\": hiring a boat on the Thames for the main party of the International Hall year. *A summer \\"farewell\\" party. Each Committee also finds its own special events or regular activities to organise; recent examples include football competitions, salsa classes, yoga, and pool & table tennis tournaments.

In sociological theory, normalization appears in two forms. First, the concept of normalization is found in the work of Michel Foucault, especially Discipline and Punish, in the context of his account of disciplinary power. As Foucault used the term, normalization involved the construction of an idealized norm of conduct - for example, the way a proper soldier ideally should stand, march, present arms, and so on, as defined in minute detail - and then rewarding or punishing individuals for conforming to or deviating from this ideal.Foucault, Michel, 1990. The History of Sexuality, Volume I: An Introduction. Robert Hurley, trans. New York: Vintage.Adams, Mary Louise, 2004. \\"The Trouble with Normal: Postwar Youth and the Making of Heterosexuality\\". In Michelle Webber and Kate Bezanson, eds., Rethinking Society in the 21st Century: Critical Readings in Sociology. Canadian Scholars' Press Inc. In Foucault's account, normalization was one of an ensemble of tactics for exerting the maximum social control with the minimum expenditure of force, which Foucault calls \\"disciplinary power\\". Disciplinary power emerged over the course of the 19th century, came to be used extensively in military barracks, hospitals, asylums, schools, factories, offices, and so on, and hence became a crucial aspect of social structure in modern societies. Second, normalization process theoryMay C, Mair FS, Finch T, MacFarlane A, Dowrick C, Treweek S, et al. Development of a theory of implementation and integration: Normalization Process Theory. Implementation Science. 2009;4 art 29 is a middle-range theory used mainly in medical sociology and science and technology studies to provide a framework for understanding the social processes by which new ways of thinking, working and organizing become routinely incorporated in everyday work. Normalization process theory has its roots in empirical studies of technological innovation in healthcare, and especially in the evaluation of complex interventions. There are different behavioral attitudes humans accept as normal, such as grief for a loved one, avoiding danger, and not participating in cannibalism.  Influences of behavior  The world is constantly changing and many things can change the situation an individual is in. Many influences such as past experiences, environment, mental strength, physical strength, people, and the media can affect a person's behavior. A person can decide to let certain things influence them. This will determine if the person is able to make a decision rationally or not. Some people fail to see the effects of their actions after letting influences affect their actions.  Mood and emotions  People can greatly be affected by their mood. One's judgement and emotional well-being is influenced by one's mood. A negative mood can cause someone to be unproductive and it will show in the person's performance. Positive moods can make a person be more active and productive. If the person is well emotion-wise, they are full of energy and are able to stay positive.  Child development  Children are known for developing behaviors based on family, friends and media influences. A child may not know what they were doing is right or wrong. They must be able to learn from experiences if their actions are right or wrong. It is the parent's job to teach the child whether it is socially accepted or not. As the child develops from a child to a young adult, most of their influence will come from their friends. It will become harder for parents to tell how the child behaves as the child grows older.  Role models  Young adults and teenagers are heavily affected by looking up to role models. Young adults are influenced to act, talk, dress and behave similarly to their role models. This can either be a positive or negative for the individual. Looking up to a role model can have positive effects, as may influence young adults to strive for success and it brings the best out of the person to do well. Positive role models are people able to overcome obstacles, inspire others, and achievements of success. However, negative role models may model bad behaviors like bullying, drug usage, and cheating, which may lead to failure rather than success. Young adults may learn to avoid problems rather than solve them. The problems with blindly copying a role model is that people start to lose a sense of identity.  Types of normal behavior   Grief  Grief is the deep sorrow usually caused by someone's death. It has now become a normal human reaction to a loss of a loved one. It is not uncommon for someone to be in sadness. Many have to deal with coping with grief.  Homosexuality  During the 1900s homosexuality was not accepted as a normal behavior and people attracted to the same gender were considered different and were heavily discriminated against. Over the years, it has now been accepted in places such as the United States, Canada and other places around the world.  Laughter  Laughter signals acceptance and trust in a group. This is often why laughter is contagious, and explains why people are unlikely to laugh alone.  Types of abnormal behavior  Abnormal behavior is broken up to two types: atypical and maladaptive. Atypical behavior is not necessarily harmful, but maladaptive behavior could potentially be harmful.

It is the sequel to the 1980 film The Exterminator. Plot Following from the previous film, it shows Eastland walking freely on the streets of New York, without any hint that his dual identity was compromised. He meets up with another old army buddy, Be Gee (Faison), who owns a garbage truck. As seen at the beginning of the film, Eastland wears a welders' mask and wields a flame thrower, while listening to a police scanner for possible crimes to stop. Slaying the brother of a gang leader named X (Van Peebles), the Exterminator gains the gang's enmity. Coincidentally, his army buddy happens to see the gang during a robbery of an armoured car, and scares them away with his truck. However, they get the truck's plate numbers, and vow revenge. Following the truck one night when the buddy loans it to Eastland, they follow Eastland to his home, and, not having seen who the driver of the truck was the night it scared them away, they presume Eastland was the man behind the wheel that night. They attack Eastland's girlfriend in the park, crippling her. Later, they break into her apartment and kill her. Then Eastland and his buddy interrupt a drug deal between X's gang and the mob, stealing the narcotics in the process, though the army buddy dies. Having earlier captured one of the gang members, Eastland allows him to escape to draw X into a confrontation, with the drugs as bait, in a closed up industrial site. Curiously, X seems to be aware of the Exterminator's real name in this final battle. Eastland triumphs, but was shot when last seen, and is seen walking away.

The Cannon Group studio was not pleased with director Mark Buntzman's original rough cut of the film, so they hired film doctor William Sachs to do extensive reshoots in Los Angeles to improve it. In 2012 interviewhttp://hidden-films.com/2012/10/22/the-hollywood-fixer-galaxina- director-william-sachs/ about his work, Sachs talked about the reshoots on Exterminator 2. He was the one who came up with idea of the Exterminator wearing the flame proof mask throughout the movie: Because of the budget problems, the movie had to be reshot in Los Angeles: Sachs also mentioned that production's initial struggles were probably due to Buntzman's inexperience handling a large film crew: According to Sachs, the character of X got his name due to more indecisiveness from Buntzman, who could not think of a better name. It was also Sachs' idea to make the character more central. Even in post-production, the film met with some troubles. The MPAA made Sachs cut down an early gory scene in which an elderly couple is shot up by the gang: In interview Sachs also had a funny anecdote about the casting of Arye Gross, who played gang member Turbo in the movie: \\"He came in and read for me, and he was talking like Marlon Brando, through his nose. It was fantastic, so I gave him the part. And when we did the scene, he didn't talk like that. I said, 'You're not talking like you did in your reading!' And he said, 'I had a cold.'\\" Sachs tried to get co-director credit for his work on Exterminator 2 but wound up accepting a co-writer and \\"additional scenes directed by\\" credit due to a legal battle with Buntzman. \\"I joined the Director's Guild after that,\\" he said. Reshoots The original script for the movie was very different to the movie the public got to see, a lot of the original scenes were removed and new scenes filmed to cobble a different storyline together, watching the movie knowing this its pretty obvious what was done since some of the original scenes are in the wrong order, for example the exterminator goes to Caroline's home early in the film but then travels in the garbage truck with her later in the film where Caroline is wearing the outfit from the previous scene in the movie. Ginty couldn't return for reshoots so for scenes in which John wears a fireproof mask and burns down the gang members with a flamethrower were filmed with Robert Ginty's stunt double. Originally the only scene where John used the flamethrower to kill the gang members was in the ending when he burns the last few after he already killed most of the others with weapons from the garbage truck. so a double was used for scenes where you never saw his face, the most obvious scene is when he phones caroline and then runs to her home to find her dead. Deborah Geffner couldn't return as Caroline but Mario Van Peebles and Frankie Faison did return for the reshoots. The original rough cut of the film has never been released. Release Shout! Factory announced they would release Exterminator 2 as part of a four-film \\"Action-Packed Movie Marathon\\" DVD set on March 19, 2013. 101 Film released the Full Never Before Seen Uncut Version on Blu-ray in the UK in September 2016.

It was published on 13 April 2006, alongside The Feast of the Drowned and The Resurrection Casket. It features the Tenth Doctor, Rose and Mickey. It is the first original novel to feature the Tenth Doctor. The title is a reference to influential Manchester band The Stone Roses. Synopsis After Mickey Smith discovers a 2000-year-old statue of Rose in a museum, she and the Doctor travel to Ancient Rome and discover some unpleasant secrets. Rose meets a girl who can predict the future, and learns to be careful what she wishes for. Plot Rose, Jackie, and the Doctor visit the British Museum where Mickey has discovered a statue of the goddess Fortuna from second-century Rome, which looks exactly like Rose. So the Doctor and Rose head off for Rome. The TARDIS brings them to AD 120. Rose and the Doctor save an elderly man named Gracilis from muggers. They learn that he is looking for his son, Optatus. A few people overhear his conversation with the Doctor and Rose and recommend a slave girl named Vanessa. When she is told what Gracilis wants, she starts to work calculations on a bit of parchment. After some discussion, Gracilis buys her from her 'owner'. The next morning, the Doctor and Rose see the new statue of Optatus. The sculptor is an unpleasant person named Ursus, who invites Rose to come to his workshop the next day to be a model for a statue of a goddess. Later, Rose goes to find Vanessa, who is with Marcia. Marcia tells them that she has known Ursus since he was a child, but that ten months ago his statues started appearing in temples. The Doctor comes bounding in to tell them what he has discovered. Prior to his disappearance, Optatus had been visiting Ursus for a couple of weeks. The impression that he had was that the statue was still in the planning stages and then Ursus says that the statue is almost done. Vanessa wakes Rose the next morning to get ready for her modeling appointment; Vanessa is prevented from accompanying her, but remains watching outside. Rose feels herself nodding off, then realizes that she cannot move as Ursus removes his gloves and touches her. The Doctor goes to the studio and tackles Ursus. Vanessa comes up with a bronze lamp, but hits the Doctor by mistake. When he awakes, the Doctor tells Vanessa that he thinks she knows more than she is telling, because she knows of an unbuilt wall dividing two countries that do not yet exist. She starts to talk, and admits to being scared for a long time, since she first arrived in Rome. Vanessa and the Doctor go into the workshop, but there is nothing there and the Doctor believes that the statue was Rose herself. The Doctor returns to the villa, asking Gracilis for help. The Doctor arrives in Rome on the 19th, which is Quinquatrus. He begins checking temples, starting with Minerva's, and asking about statues made by Ursus. He spends all day searching, and as evening approaches, he enters another shrine to Fortuna, and find a statue who shares the pose, but isn't Rose. The Doctor comments \\"Rose is prettier than you.\\" and is surprised to hear the statue reply \\"Thanks.\\" As he starts forward, a glass vial of green liquid rolls from behind the statue to his feet, and the voice says it will bring back Rose and all the others. The Doctor steps forward again, but is interrupted by Gracilis who shouts a warning. The Doctor drops the vial when he is slapped by a Roman soldier. He is dragged away from the shrine, unable to get the vial back. The Doctor is taken to the Flavian Amphitheatre, thrown into the dungeon, and has his sonic screwdriver taken away. He is awake all night, and the guards come in the morning to tell him he is being set free. On the way, he grabs his sonic screwdriver. He meets up with Gracilis again once outside, and they go back to Fortuna's temple. The vial is not there, but Gracilis had picked it up on his last visit. The two of them go looking for statues done by Ursus, and find Tiro first. After bringing him back to life, they begin scouring Rome for the rest, using Gracilis' art contacts to help in their search. Gracilis arranges transport for all of the slaves, plus the TARDIS. They arrive back at the villa and bring Optatus back to life. The Doctor is wondering how he is going to ever find Rose, and then decides to go back to the museum in 21st century London. He lands the TARDIS inside and finds Mickey there. Mickey states that \\"Whoever made this must have really known her.\\" The Doctor tells Mickey that the statue isn't of Rose, but is Rose. Mickey gets mad at the Doctor, and they decide it's best to bring her back, but nothing happens when the liquid pours on her. His hand brushes her face, and then he runs back to the TARDIS. He returns with Rose's denim jacket, and shakes out her earring. Meaning that Rose is only wearing one earring. The statue, however, is wearing two, so it can't be her. He runs back to the TARDIS and leaves. Rose wakes up with the Doctor grinning in front of her. Vanessa arrives, the Doctor again asks how Vanessa got to Rome, and she says her father worked in AI (Artificial Intelligence). Vanessa was watching a vidcast on Rome in her father's study, with a box sitting on the desk. And she remembered herself saying that she wished she lived back then, and then she was here. The three of them come in to Ursus' workshop and while speaking to Ursus and the goddess, the Doctor figures something out. He says to Minerva \\"I wish I could see what you really look like.\\" and Rose spies a creature in a box that looks like a cross between a dragon and a platypus. Ursus in fury lunges at the Doctor with a knife, but Ursus touches Vanessa (turning her to stone), and Rose jumps on Ursus' back. She knocks him down and he falls on his own dagger, but the Doctor was also turned to stone during the chaos. Rose wishes that he had never come to Rome, and then the Doctor had vanished. Rose talks to the creature in the box, and is told that it is a GENIE (Genetically Engineered Neural Imagination Engine). Its purpose is to grant all wishes it hears. Rose realizes what has been happening and as a test, makes a very careful wish for chips. She then wishes for the vial to be refilled, and brings Vanessa back. Vanessa asks if the GENIE can return her home, but the GENIE says there isn't enough energy available. Soon, Rose wishes for herself and Vanessa to be safe. Safe turns out to be a white nothingness. However, during her time in the white nothingness, Rose works out that if she'd said the words \\"I wish you'd never come here.\\" then the Doctor would have never come to Rome and wouldn't have taken her to Rome, so she wouldn't have been there to make the wish, and she wouldn't be in Rome after she made the wish. So, Rose wishes that she and Vanessa were back in the temple and that they could see everything as it really is. The world reappears, and Rose sees the figure of the Doctor, who explains about the GENIEs, how they became a problem for Earth as everyone made wishes and wouldn't stop, draining all of the power sources on Earth and causing mass chaos. To save the planet, a group of people powered the earliest GENIE they could find with the sun and wished for it to reverse time to the day it was made. The GENIE burned up upon arrival in the past from using the sun's energy and its destruction destroyed all research into GENIE technology. Vanessa's GENIE survived as it was the prototype and was thus created before the other GENIES and was unaffected by the time reversal. They take the TARDIS from the villa, and arrive in Fortuna's shrine. The Doctor gives Rose the vial and a metal device to talk through. She hides behind the statue, and sees the Doctor coming in. She rolls the vial out to him, and then watches his arrest by Rufus. Gracilis sees the vial, picks it up and walks away. The Doctor and Rose then take Vanessa home, but are having trouble deciding what to do with the GENIE. Rose tells the GENIE is a slave, and if it is set free, it would be able to fulfill wishes if it wanted to. Rose wishes it free, and the GENIE disappears. They are getting ready to head home themselves, when Rose realizes there is a problem because her Fortuna statue was never made. However, The Doctor says he made the statue that appeared in the 21st century museum, because he went to the Renaissance and took a sculpting course with Michelangelo. They make one final trip to the villa, and gave the statue to Gracilis and Marcia, to take the place of the statue of Optatus. Audio book An abridged audio book version of The Stone Rose read by David Tennant was released in July 2006 () by BBC Audiobooks. Also included was an interview with the author by David Darlington. In January 2007 the Radio Times made an offer of adding a free copy of \\"The Stone Rose,\\" in two parts over two issues. These versions omitted the interview. Critical reception Matt Michael, reviewing the book for Doctor Who Magazine, wrote that the portrayal of the Doctor tended towards the \\"generic\\" (the book had been released before the debut of Tennant's first full season).

The day opened with an over-35 men's singles semifinal match won by Stan Smith over John Newcombe. In the first of two men's singles semifinal contests, Ivan Lendl advanced to his third consecutive US Open final after outlasting Pat Cash 3‚Äì6, 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì7 (5‚Äì7), 7‚Äì6 (7‚Äì4).

The lengthy day at Center Court was made possible by CBS which was televising the tournament. Not wanting a recurrence of what happened the previous year when three quick contests forced a scramble to fill the remaining allocated time, the network had requested the addition of the Smith-Newcombe match to lead off the program. The broadcast established what was then the longest continuous coverage of a sporting event in American television history.CBS at 75 Timeline: 1980s ‚Äì CBS.com. Tennis fans who were present at Armstrong Stadium to enjoy all the contests that day were able to do so on a single admission.

In the process, they also began charging separate admission for each of the two sessions on the last Saturday of the fortnight.
