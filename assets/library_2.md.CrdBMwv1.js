He joined the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church and was elevated to Metropolitan of Goa, Ceylon and Greater India in the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. Early life Alvares was born to a Goan Catholic family in Verna, Goa, Portuguese India. Priest Alvares was appointed by the Archbishop of Goa to minister to Catholics in British India. The Portuguese Crown claimed these territories by virtue of old privileges of Padroado (papal privilege of royal patronage granted by popes beginning in the 14th century). The more modern Popes and the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith separated these areas and reorganised them as apostolic vicariates ruled by non-Portuguese bishops, since the English rulers wished to have non-Portuguese bishops. Successive Portuguese governments fought against this, terming this as unjustified aggression by later Popes against the irrevocable grant of Royal Patronage to the Portuguese Crown, an agitation that spread to the Goan patriots, subjects of the Portuguese Crown. When, under Pope Pius IX and Pope Leo XIII, the hierarchy in British India was formally reorganised independently of Portugal but with Portuguese consent, a group of pro-Padroado Goan Catholics in Bombay united under the leadership of Dr. Pedro Manoel Lisboa Pinto and Alvares as the Society for the Defense of the Royal Patronage and agitated against the Holy See, the British India government and the Portuguese government in opposition to these changes. Uniting with Orthodox Church Their agitation failed to reverse the changes. Angry with the Portuguese government, the group broke away from the Catholic Church and joined the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. Bishop Alvares was consecrated as Mar Julius I, on 28 July 1889, by the Orthodox Bishop of Kottayam, Paulose Mar Athanasious, with the permission of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch Ignatius Peter IV to be Archbishop of autocephalous Latin Rite of Ceylon, Goa, and India. While he was a priest of the Catholic Church, he was in search of the true Biblically Christian One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church. He was against the false devotion and religious exhibitionism. He objected to the Concordat of the Pope and interference of the Government in the Church administration. He could not withstand the harassment meted out to him by the ecclesiastical and civil powers. He went to Western and Eastern Churches and finally came to Maliankara and joined the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. Credited with good faith and piety and true regard for others, he was consecrated as bishop by Joseph Mar Dionysius, Geevarghese Mar Gregorios of Parumala, Mar Paulose Ivanios of Kandanadu and Mar Athanasios (Kadavil) in Kottayam on 29 July 1889. He was elevated to Metropolitan Archbishop of Ceylon, Goa and India excluding Malabar. When Joseph Ren√© Vilatte was soliciting for consecration by a bishop with orders recognised by the Catholic Church, he was guided to Alvares, who jointly with Mar Athanasious, and with the permission of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch, consecrated him in 1892 in Colombo, British Ceylon. This became Alvares' cathedral. Alvares lived in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in the twin villages of Brahmavar & Kalianpur, Karnataka and finally in Ribandar, Goa where he died of dysentery and was buried. Pinto, acting in his capacity as the United States Consul, witnessed Alvares' and Vilatte's consecrations. In Portuguese Goa Since Alvares was not allowed by the rulers to work freely in Goa. he was mostly based in Canara region of Karnataka with the main base at Brahmavar. He along with Rev. Fr. Roque Zephrin Noronha worked among the people along the west coast of India from Mangalore to Bombay. About 5000 families joined the Orthodox Church. He ordained Rev. Fr. Joseph Kanianthra, Rev. Fr. Lukose Kannamcote and Deacon David Kunnamkulam at Brahmawar on 15 October 1911. Alvares and Pinto continued their efforts to draw many Goans from the Imperial Church and to Orthodoxy. The Brahmavar (Goan) Orthodox Church (BOC) failed in this goal, for outside this group very few Goans moved to this sect. In British Ceylon Alvares was in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) for more than five years. While there he consecrated Vilatte as bishop in the presence of Mar Gregorios of Parumala in 1892. The denomination that consecrated Vilatte was a part of the Malankara Syriac Orthodox Church that had a Latin Rite patrimony. V. Nagam Aiya wrote, in Travancore State Manual, that Alvares \\"describe[d] his Church as the Latin branch of the Syriac Church of Antioch.\\" Here, the surname Alvares is spelled Alvarez. The Holy See sought to consolidate two co-existing jurisdictions, the Padroado jurisdiction and the Congregation for Propagation of the Faith jurisdiction. The Padroado was the privilege of patronage extended to Portugal which granted the right of designating candidates for episcopal and other offices and benefices in Africa and the East Indies; in addition, it was an exchange of a portion of ecclesiastical revenues for missionaries and endowments to religious establishments in those territories. In time it was seen by the Holy See as an obstacle to missions: the Portuguese government failed to observe the conditions of the agreement; disagreed about the extent of the patronage by claiming the agreement was restricted by Pope Alexander VI's Bulls of Donation and Treaty of Tordesillas while Rome maintained the agreement was restricted to conquered countries; and, contested papal appointments of missionary bishops or vicars apostolic made without its consent, in countries which were never subject to its dominion. As part of the transition, churches served by Goan Catholic priests remained under the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of the East Indies until 1843. Later, this transition was delayed and extended until 1883-12-31. In British Ceylon, it ended in 1887 with the appearance of a papal decree that placed all Catholics in the country under the exclusive jurisdiction of the bishops of the island. That measure met resistance. Alvares and Dr. Pedro Manoel Lisboa Pinto founded in Goa, Portuguese India, an association for the defence of the Padroado. Then, according to G. Bartas, in , they complained that the new diocese and vicariates were headed, almost exclusively, by European prelates and missionaries, and petitioned the Holy See for the creation of a purely native hierarchy. Bartas did not state if there was a response, but wrote that Alvares settled the difficulty by reinventing himself as the head of his schism, appearing in Ceylon, and settling into the main old Goan Portuguese churches in the village of Parapancandel. Here, the surname Alvares is spelled Alvarez. Alvares was a Roman Catholic Brahmin. Aiya wrote that Alvares, an educated man and the editor of a Catholic journal, was a priest in the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Goa. Failing to maintain amicable relations with the Patriarch of the East Indies, Alvares left the and joined Mar Dionysius the Metropolitan in Kottayam who consecrated Alvares as bishop. Later, he returned with the title of Alvares Mar Julius Archbishop of Ceylon, Goa and the Indies, and involved in his schism about 20 parishes in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Jaffna and in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Colombo on the island. Michael Roberts, in Sri Lanka Journal of Social Science, describes three groups within early nationalism in British Ceylon. The most prominent group, \\"ultra-moderate constitutionalists\\", with culture and value system significantly westernised, whose main goal was greater participation in government; the second group, \\"mild-radicals\\", represented by leaders like Pinto, was a labour movement with political radicalism and interest in more radical trade unions; the third group, \\"religio-cultural revitalists\\", traditional values Sinhalese Buddhists \\"which expressed militant objection to changes produced by Western penetration.\\" Roberts wrote all three groups interacted with the others and had indigenous, Indian, and Burgher people among members, in a complex social tapestry whose members also changed group affiliations over time. A strike at the largest publisher in Colombo, influenced by Pinto's propaganda, took place in September 1893. The next day, Pinto became president of the newly formed printers union. \\"The main grievances of the printers included low pay and bad working and living conditions.\\" According to Peter-Ben Smit, in Old Catholic and Philippine Independent Ecclesiologies in History, the Union of Utrecht's (UU) International Old Catholic Bishops' Conference (IBC) discussed a request for admission in 1902. Smit observed that past \\"experiences had made ... the cautious, which in his opinion was a reason for the failure of contacts with groups in ... Ceylon ... and other countries to develop into relationships of full communion.\\" La Croix, Catholic Messenger of Ceylon reported that the Alvares schism ended in 1902. Bartas did not recount the significance of Alvares' ideology, he only noted that the schism, around 1902, intended to convert corporately, to eastern orthodoxy. The cathedral in Colombo had one priest, Alvares, fairly advanced in age. He and his parishioners asked the Holy Synod of the Church of Greece, in Athens, to accept them under its jurisdiction and to send them an officiating priest preaching in Latin and English. Bartas wrote: But the Greek Holy Synod reflected on information provided by the Archimandrite Germain Kazakis, head of the Orthodox settlement of Calcutta, in addition to the parishioners' application in which they declared themselves Orthodox but still held Roman Catholic liturgies, sacraments, and devotions. According to Smit, \\"presumably seeing an analogy between the respective emergences of the two churches,\\" Stephen Silva, the secretary, complained to Gregorio Aglipay of the Philippine Independent Church in 1903 that the \\"cannot get sufficient priests to work independently of Rome.\\" Bartas wrote, in 1904 that the Greek Holy Synod \\"will undoubtedly continue to defer its response\\" under these conditions. Smit mentioned that the also failed to create \\"a relationship with the Greek Orthodox Church in the 1910s.\\" In 1913, Adrian Fortescue described Alvares' faction, in The Lesser Eastern Churches, as \\"chiefly famous for the begging letters they write and the doubt they cause to people who receive these letters as to who exactly they may be.\\" Educator Alvares was a scholar, man of high principles and had a formidable personality. He opened a college where Goan priests were teaching Portuguese, Latin, French, and Philosophy. In 1912, Alvares opened an English School in Panaji. Both operated for a short time. Social worker At that time Goa was frequently affected by epidemic like malaria, typhoid, small pox, cholera and plague. Alvares published a pamphlet on the treatment of cholera. He was concerned about the shortage of food in Goa and appealed to the people to produce cheaper food. He published a booklet about the cultivation of cassava. Apostle of charity In 1871, he started a charitable association in Panaji to render help to the poor, beginning with wandering beggars. After a few years he extended the association to other cities in Goa. During the last ten years of his life he concentrated his activities in Panaji. His home accommodated the poor and destitute as well as lepers and tuberculosis patients. He was a beggar without an income. One day Alvares requested a shopkeeper for a contribution, but the shopkeeper spat in the bowl. Without getting angry, Alvares said, \\"All right, I shall keep this for me. Now, give something for the poor.\\" The shopkeeper contributed generously. Patriot and saint This designation was given to Alvares by Goan historians. After joining the Orthodox Church, Alvares was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church. He was persecuted by the Catholic Church and the Portuguese Government. Though he was advised by some of his old friends to reunite with the Catholic Church, especially when he was very sick, he refused and stuck to his Orthodox faith. Martyr An older photo of Alvares Alvares embraced the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. He was excommunicated and persecuted. He was arrested, stripped of his episcopal vestments and taken through the street in his underwear to the police lock-up and placed into a filthy prison cell without a bed or chair. He was forcibly deprived of his cross and the ring, the episcopal insigne he was wearing. He was beaten and presented in the court. But the government could not prove the allegations and he was acquitted. After a few days, he was arrested again and charged with the offence of high treason, but again the Justice found him innocent. He was no longer allowed to use his episcopal vestments and wore a black robe. When he was persecuted, none of the Orthodox Church people were nearby because he had no support or person in Goa from the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. Death Alvares died of dysentery on 23 September 1923 in Ribandar hospital, a charitable institution. He wished to be buried by Orthodox designates and was specific not to have any Catholic priest for the same. The citizen committee led by the Chief Justice arranged a grand funeral. His body lay in state in the Municipal Hall for 24 hours. The newspapers were full of articles and obituaries about Alvares. Though Alvares was considered an enemy by the government, the Governor General sent his representative. Thousands of people especially poor and beggars paid their last respects. Funeral speeches were made by high dignitaries. The day after his death, a funeral procession wound through all the main roads of Panaji and ended in a secluded corner of St. Inez cemetery where his body was laid to rest without any funeral rites. Veneration Alvares' grave prior to disinterment In 1927, his bones were collected by his friends and admirers, placed in a lead box and reburied, under a marble slab with the inscription \\", \\" (In memory of priest Antonio Francisco Xavier Alvares, who was very humanitarian missionary and a great patriot) and the largest cross in the cemetery. In 1967, Metropolitan Mathews Mar Athanasios, of the Outside Kerala diocese inquired and found the grave during his visit to Goa. A small church was constructed in Ribandar and, in 1979, Alvares' remains were disinterred and placed in the church by Metropolitan Philipose Mar Theophilose of the Bombay diocese. St. Mary's Orthodox Syrian church, Ribandar. The location of Alvares' entombed remains When the St. Mary's church was reconstructed in the same place, Alvares' remains were moved to the present ossuary which was specially made on the side of the altar by Moran Mar Baselios Mar Thoma Mathews II, Catholicos of the East, on 6 October 2001. Alvares' remains are entombed at St. Mary's Orthodox church in Ribandar. Although the congregation was small, the Brahmavar Orthodox Community has survived almost a century after Alvares' death. His dukrono, a memorial feast, is celebrated at St. Mary's Orthodox Syrian church in Ribandar on 23 September every year.  Works or publications   Newspapers Alvares started a number of periodicals; most of them were educative and supportive of the right of the public. He was a critic of the government. Most of the periodicals were banned and forced to stop publications after few years. *A Cruz (in Portuguese) *A Verdade (in Portuguese) *O Brado Indiano (in Portuguese) *O Progresso de Goa (in Portuguese) *Times of Goa (in Portuguese) Notes and references Notes References Further reading * ALEXANDER, G. and T.

He researched and published a book, Vita S. Thomae (Life of St. Thomas) in about 1180, which is today known chiefly for a short section in which he gave an eyewitness account of the events in the cathedral. On the day of the murder Grim was among a group who accompanied Becket into Canterbury Cathedral and stood by him during his altercation with the knights. He attempted to protect Becket from their attack until his own arm being nearly cut off by a stroke aimed at the primate, he fell to the ground but was able to crawl away to the altar where the archbishop's other clerks had hidden, and escaped with his life. His Vita S. Thomas cannot have been completed earlier than 1174 as it contains an account of the penance of Henry II; another passage seems to show that it was written not later than 1177 (Materials, ii. 448‚Äì9; cf. Magnusson, pref. to Thomas Saga, ii. lxxxii). As it would seem that Grim did not meet Becket until a few days before the latter's death his information concerning the primate's life must be considered second-hand apart from the last scenes to which he was an eye-witness. A large part of his narrative closely resembles that of the French poet Garnier (or Guernes) de Pont-Sainte-Maxence, who completed his own work in 1175. Whether Grim copied Garnier or Garnier copied Grim is not certain, but the former is most likely. Grim was dead before Herbert of Bosham finished his work on St. Thomas, i.e. by 1186, or at latest 1189.

He introduced a world era calculation, who reckoned 5,904 years from Adam (in Greek \\"Œ±œÄœå Œ∫œÑŒØœÉŒµœâœÇ Œ∫œåœÉŒºŒøœÖ\\", \\"apo ktiseos kosmou\\" or \\"Œ≠œÑŒøœÇ Œ∫œåœÉŒºŒøœÖ\\", \\"aetos kosmou\\", that is 'since world's creation' or \\"Anno Mundi\\") to the year 412 CE, about which time he lived. This era is usually termed the Antiochian, sometimes the Alexandrian era. Its new year was also transferred to September 1, in which case the eight latter months of its year 5493 are the eight former months of the year one of our chronology. More important than this is the Byzantine World Era, which long served as the standard of computation in the Eastern Empire, in Russia, among the Albanians, Servians, and Modern Greeks. It counts sixteen years in excess of the Antiochian era, though likewise beginning the year with September 1; its year 5509 began with September 1 of the year one before Christ. This era was in use in Russia until 1700; whence it originated appears not to be known.New Schaff- Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, vol. 4., p. 163, article \\"Era\\" By the 10th century, this dating system (its beginning fixed at 5509 BCE) became standard in the Byzantine Empire and thereby, the Orthodox countries of Eastern Europe. But as such Anno Mundi time systems became very popular, they created a huge problem: end-of-world fever, caused by a threatening Seventh Day that equated to the end of the 6000-year period and corresponded to a date 500 years after Christ's birth year. So many Chiliasm, or Millenarianism, emphasizing religious movements arose at that period. In 1492, Sir Thomas Browne supported also the belief that the world was created in 5509 BCE and that its ordained lifetime was 7,000 years.

His rule coincided with the revolutionary tide that culminated in the 1848 Wallachian revolution. Early political career Born in Craiova as the first son of Dimitrie Bibescu, a member of the Bibescu boyar family, he studied Law in Paris. After his return to Wallachia, he was elected deputy in the Extraordinary Public Assembly, the legislative forum established by the Imperial Russian overseers at the end of the Russo-Turkish War of 1828‚Äì1829, representing the Dolj County during the Pavel Kiseleff administration. He subsequently took on different offices, including that of secretary of state. Before his election as hospodar, he was seen as an opponent of his predecessor, Alexandru II Ghica. Hospodar of Wallachia Election The Wallachian Assembly in 1837 On January 1, 1843, the first (and only) elections carried out in accordance with the Organic Statute took place in Wallachia; these were carried out by a representative assembly, and had been prompted by Ghica's abuse.Hitchins, p.212 Of many candidates, Bibescu and his older brother, Barbu ≈ûtirbei, were the most popular choices with Imperial Russia. Bibescu was elected hospodar, supported by both the conservative boyars and the younger liberals. One of his first gestures in office was to grant pardon to radicals who had conspired against Ghica (including MiticƒÉ Filipescu and Nicolae BƒÉlcescu). Bibescu did not change the government immediately after the election, as it was made up mostly of Ghica's political adversaries. However, his relations with the Public Assembly started to deteriorate due to disagreements on several legislative projects. The Trandafiloff affair and dissolution of the Assembly A soir√©e at the Princely Palace, 1843 In the spring of 1844, the Wallachian government approved the request of the Russian engineer Alexander Trandafiloff, to be allowed to administer the country's mines (which were subject to private ownership).Jelavich, p.93 Moreover, if any mine owner did not begin extracting from their mines within 18 months, the Russian company was to take over the administration of the mines for 12 years, by paying 10% of the income to the owner and 10% to the Wallachian state. Bibescu approved the contract, but the Public Assembly protested against it: the deputies saw it as an intervention of the protecting power in local politics. The contract was eventually cancelled, but, caught between the Assembly's position and the Russian authorities, on March 4, 1844, Bibescu dissolved the Public Assembly with the approval of Russian Emperor Nicholas I.Hitchins, p.212 When elections for the body were convened in November 1846, he used several means to silence opposition, thus awarding himself a subservient legislature.Hitchins, p.213 A clear separation between him and Romantic nationalists occurred when he ordered the refoundation of the Saint Sava College as a French-language school  based on his view that Romanian was incompatible with modernization.Hitchins, p.212-213 Two and a half years after that, Bibescu passed laws for public works and public administration. In the summer of 1844, he took a long trip through the country in order to inspect the public institutions and local authorities in the major cities. On the eve of the Revolution of 1848 The Islaz Proclamation In December 1846, he was advised by Kiseleff to call for new Public Assembly elections. The elections brought a new Assembly dominated by politicians loyal to the hospodar. With this legislature, Bibescu passed several important laws, such as a new law on the Eastern Orthodox clergy, one that allowed the hospodar to approve the church budget, and a law freeing all the Gypsy slaves who belonged to the church and to the public authorities. Gheorghe Bibescu worked for better relations with Moldavia (the other Danubian Principality under Russian supervision), and, starting 1847, the two countries established a customs union, after an agreement with Mihail Sturdza, the Moldavian hospodar.Hitchins, p.212 This was the culmination of his attempt to remove Wallachia's traders and guilds from foreign competition (see Sudi≈£i), first manifested in his project to increase taxes on foreign goods.Hitchins, p.212 Bibescu also convinced the Russian government to allow him to impose some taxes on those monasteries that had been dedicated to various Orthodox centers of worship outside the Danubian Principalities' territories (the ownership issue, stringent ever since the end of the Phanariote epoch, implied that church property eluded state intervention, channelling income towards places such as Mount Athos; it was to be settled through secularization under the rule of Alexandru Ioan Cuza). Maria VƒÉcƒÉrescu-Bibescu In the summer of 1848, the revolution broke out. Initially, Wallachian radicals had unsuccessfully attempted to attract Bibescu to their side. They then issued the Islaz Proclamation of June 9, 1848. On June 11, Gheorghe Bibescu accepted the proclamation and two days later, abdicated and left the country, leaving it to be ruled by a Provisoral Government which succumbed to Ottoman intervention in September. In 1859, Bibescu was presented as candidate to the throne by the conservatives who opposed Wallachia's union with Moldavia. He died in Paris. Personal life Gheorghe Bibescu was married to Zoe Br√¢ncoveanu, the last of the Br√¢ncoveanu family, therefore inheriting all the titles and wealth. The marriage was unsuccessful, as Zoe became mentally ill. Bibescu entered into a conflict with the Orthodox Church, as he wanted to divorce Zoe. He eventually managed to obtain the divorce in 1845 and in September of the same year, he married Maria VƒÉcƒÉrescu, in Foc≈üani. The Br√¢ncoveanu patrimony passed on to Zoe and Gheorghe Bibescu's son, Gr√©goire Bibesco-Bassaraba (the father of Anna de Noailles).

Theoretical background Drive theory and drive diagram In contrast to Freud's work, Szondi's approach is based on a systematic drive theoryLeopold Szondi [1947] (1952) Experimental Diagnostics of Drives, Introduction of the first edition, as quoted in M√©lon (1996): and a dimensional model of personality. That is, Szondi means to enumerate all human drives, classifying and framing them within a comprehensive theory. Szondi drive system is built on the basis of eight drive needs,Szondi (1972) p.25Szondi (1978) ch. 3.1 p.65 each corresponding to a collective archetype of instinctive action.Szondi (1978) ch. 2.11 pp.62‚Äì3 They are: * the h-drive need, (named after hermaphroditism, which represents the needs for personal or collective love, tenderness, motherliness, passivity, femininity, bisexuality),Szondi (1978) ch. 3.3, pp.74‚Äì5 * the sadist drive need * the e-drive need (named after epilepsy, which represents coarse emotions such as anger, hatred, rage, envy, jealousy and revenge, which simmer until they are suddenly and explosively discharged as if in a seizure, to the surprise and shock of other people), * the hysteric drive need * the katatonic drive need * the paranoid drive need * the depressive drive need * the maniac drive needSzondi (1972) p.35 The eight drive needs represent archetypes and are present in all individuals in different proportions; a fundamental assumption of Fate analysis is that the difference between mental \\"illness\\" and mental \\"health\\" is not qualitative but quantitative. affects) and Schizoform (Sch, representing the ego) vectors at the inner part of the psyche. A whole drive (Triebe, in Szondi's own terms), like the sexual drive S, is composed of a pair of two opposite drive needs (Triebbed√ºrfnisse), in this case h (tender love) and s (sadism). Each drive need in turn has a positive and negative striving (Triebstrebung), for instance h+ (personal tender love) and h- (collective love), or s+ (sadism toward the other) and s- (masochism). The four whole drives correspond to the four independent hereditary circles of mental illness established by the psychiatric genetics of the time:Szondi (1978) ch.3 p.72Ellenberger, H. (1970) The Discovery of the Unconscious, p.866 the schizoform drive (containing the paranoid and the catatonic drive needs), the manic-depressive drive, the paroxysmal drive (including the epileptic and hysteric drive needs), and the sexual drive (including the hermaprodite and the sadomasochist drive needs).Szondi (1972) pp.34‚Äì6 quotation: Szondi's drive diagram has been described as his major discovery and achievement. quotation: It has also been described as a revolutionary addition to psychology, and as paving the way for a theoretical psychiatry and a psychoanalytical anthropology.Livres de France (1989), Issues 106‚Äì109 quotation: Szondi theory organizes phenomenons like: Antisocial personality disorder, paraphilia subtypes, histrionic personality disorder (P++), paranoid proper as \\"projective paranoid\\", narcissistic personality disorder as \\"inflative paranoid\\", blunted affect (P00), panic disorder (P), phobia (P+0), hypochondria (Cm-),Szondi (1972) pp.156,160,191,198,320, and p.421 Abb.40 stupor (-hy),Szondi (1972) pp.109,113 somatization and pain disorder as organ neurosis,Szondi (1972) pp.402; and Szondi (1963) Schicksalsanalytische Therapie, pp.113, 375‚Äì380 conversion disorder (in Pe+, Phy and Schk- danger classes), dissociative fugue (Sch¬±- and C+0),Szondi (1972) pp.163‚Äì4, 189 paroxysmal attack (Sch¬±-),Szondi (1972) pp.163‚Äì4 depersonalization disorder and alienation (Sch-¬±), obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder and obsessive‚Äìcompulsive personality disorder (Sch¬±+).Szondi (1972) pp.60,167 The drive factors and vectors in detail Fate analysis and anthropology Szondi analysis of destiny approach is based an anthropological preoccupation. Szondi's main philosophical references for the concept of fate are Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation (1818) and Heidegger's Being and Time (1927).Szondi (1972) Intro.., p.9 Fate analysis of a patient is based on the test score, the patient medical history, and his family background through a genealogical tree. Fate analysis includes Genotropism, a form of depth psychology that had some prominence in Europe in the mid-20th century, but has been ignored for the most part. The starting assumption of fate analysis is that a person's life (destiny) unfolds in a series of elections: one chooses an occupation, acquaintances, partners, family, and ultimately his decisions implicitly selects his illnesses and his death. Szondi‚Äôs experience in genealogy research led him to believe that these elections can not be considered only as the individual sovereign decision, but that such choices often follow certain patterns that preexisted within his family ancestors. Szondi concluded that some life choices are genetically inherited. Profession choice and fate Szondi argued that his research showed that profession choices are determined by the dynamic and structure of the psyche, a phenomenon that he called operotropism. Of the many possibilities in which operotropism can manifest itself, he gave two examples. A man may choose a profession in which he can engage with individuals with related inclinations; this is the case of a psychiatrist with paranoid schizoform inclinations, or a lawyer with querulant inclinations and an addiction to litigation. The second example of operotropism is a man that chooses a profession in which he can satisfy in a socially acceptable manner needs that in their original primary form would constitute a danger for society. This is the case of pyromania-firefighter, sadism-butcher, coprophilia-intestine or -drain cleaner.Szondi (1978) Schicksalsanalyse, Ch.XV Erbkreise und Berufskreise, pp.260‚Äì2Szondi (1978) ch.20 Trieb und Beruf, pp.336‚Äì342 Most jobs can satisfy more than one drive need.

Test description It is a projective personality test, the same category of the most-known Rorschach test, but with the crucial difference of being nonverbal. The test consists in showing the examinee a series of facial photographs,Thomas R. Alley Social and Applied Aspects of Perceiving Faces p.99 displayed in six groups of eight each. All 48 subjects featured in the photographs are mental patients, each group containing a photo of a person whose personality had been classified as homosexual, a sadist, an epileptic, an hysteric, a katatonic, a paranoid, a depressive and a maniac. The subject is asked to choose the two most appealing and the two most repulsive photos of each group. The choices will supposedly reveal the subject satisfied and unsatisfied instinctive drive needs, and the subject's dimensions of personality.Eugenio Ra√πl Zaffaroni, Edmundo Oliveira (2013) Criminology and Criminal Policy Movements p.315 quotation: Each photo is supposed to be a stimulus apt to detect the pulsional drive tendencies of the examinee, from which the main personality traits can surface.Szondi in Nuovi Dizionari Online Simone ‚Äì Dizionario di Scienze Psicologiche Szondi said that for some disturbed examinees the stimulus of seeing the photo of a mental patient with the same pathology caused them to have crisis and convulsions during the test examination. Szondi further broke down the results into four different vectors: a homosexual/sadistic, epileptic/hysterical, catatonic/paranoid and depressive/manic. Szondi believed that people are inherently attracted to people similar to them . His theory of genotropism states that there are specific genes that regulate mate selection, and that similarly-gened individuals would seek each other out. To interpret the test scores, a variety of methods have been developed by Szondi himself and other researchers. They can be classified as quantitative, qualitative and proportional methods. Accomplishments and results Szondi said that from a sociological perspective, the most important discovery made through fate psychology has been operotropism, that is the discerning of the role played by latent inherited genes (genotropic factors) in the choice of a particular vocation or profession.Szondi (1972), fifth conference, p.97Chapter 3 ‚Äì Genotropism and Family Relationships, szondiforum Production The Szondi test is a psychological exam named after its Jewish Hungarian creator, L√©opold Szondi in the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University in Budapest Hungary.

First results of this research were published in 1963. Szondi condensed the syndromatics into a table called Testsymptome zur Bestimmung der 17 Existenzformen (test symptoms for the identification of the 17 existence forms), which was published in Szondiana VI (1966) and in the final edition of book 2 (1972). However, the table alone is not sufficient, as analysis of the forms existence still demands \\"solid knowledge and practice of Syndromatik\\", in addition to thorough training in Fate Analysis thinking.(1968) Europ√§ische Hochschulschriften: Psychologie p.99, quotation: Origin of the photographs One of the 30 images taken from Weygandt's Atlas, used by Szondi as n.7 in serie 6. 30 of the 48 photographs were taken from Wilhelm Weygandt's 1901 Atlas und Grundriss der Psychiatrie, which is now in the public domain.

The shock element of the photos is crucial. Commenting an experiment with alternative pictures of mental patients, Szondi argued that since the photos used were nicer or less disturbing, they failed to trigger the responses that the test is supposed to.Szondi (1972) Lehrbuch der Experimentellen Triebdiagnostik, 3rd edition, Anhang IV, p.451 quotation: The dispute on statistics The Szondi test is not widely used in modern clinical psychology, because its psychometric properties are weak. However, it remains in the history of psychology as one of the well-known psychological instruments, although its use today is marginal, being replaced by modern psychological instruments, with good psychometric properties. Influences Szondi Fate analysis has influenced philosophers Henri Niel, Alphonse De Waelhens and Henry Maldiney, and psychiatrist Jacques Schotte.M√©lon, Jean (1996) Notes on the History of the Szondi Movement, (French original ) Text for the Szondi Congress of Cracow, August 1996. quotation: In 1949, Susan Deri published the first English language description to the Szondi test.Deri, Susan (1949) Introduction to the Szondi Test: Theory and Practice Some graphologists attempted to integrate the szondi test with graphological test; however, Sonzdi was not a graphologist and the goal of his test was in contrast with graphology.The Szondi Test: In Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Treatment (1959) p.47 quotation: In 1959, the international Szondi Society was established, and holds a symposium every three years. In 1969, The Szondi Institute was formed, and published from Zurich the journal Szondiana.Richardson, Diane (2009) The Szondi Test, pp.15‚Äì6 Artist Kurt Kren created a motion picture, 2/60 48 K√∂pfe aus dem Szondi-Test, from the still shots of the Szondi test in 1964. Szondi books on fate analysis Main books series Szondi's main work is his five volume series on fate analysis (Schicksalsanalyse). They were first published from 1944 (volume one) to 1963 (volume five). The first two were later republished in multiple revised editions. They are: * Das erste Buch: Schicksalsanalyse. Wahl in Liebe, Freundschaft, Beruf, Krankheit und Tod.Das erste Buch: Schicksalsanalyse. Wahl in Liebe, Freundschaft, Beruf, Krankheit und Tod B. Schwabe, Basel, 1944. (2nd edition 1948, 3rd edition 1965, fourth edition 1978) * Das zweite Buch: Lehrbuch der Experimentellen Triebdiagnostik (Textband). Huber, Bern und Stuttgart, 1947. (1st edition 308pp, 2nd edition 1960 443pp, 3rd edition 1972 484pp) This is the book in which Szondi explains in details how to perform and interpret the test. Only the first edition, which would be completely overhauled in 1960, was translated into English as Experimental Diagnostics of Drives (1952). The 1972 third edition added a 40-page long appendix, that included a table to help determine the dangerous and the protective forms of existence. The Textband (text volume) is complemented by two additional (smaller) volumes, sold separately: Band 2: Testband, which contains the photographs and additional material to take the test, and Band 3: Trieblinn√§us-Band (classification of instincts). * Das dritte Buch: Triebpathologie, also called and classified as Triebpathologie, Band I (Drive pathology, volume I), and subtitled Elemente der exakten Triebpsychologie und Triebpsychiatrie.

Characteristics  The Bali ponies are quite hardy and self-sufficient, surviving with little outside care. They are tough animals that are not shod and are remarkably sound, with hard feet, and strong legs. The ponies show the usual \\"primitive markings\\" such as a dorsal stripe, shoulder bars, and zebra stripes on the legs, in addition to their dun coat, that includes a black mane, tail, and legs.Bongianni Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses & Ponies of the World entry 127 The ponies lack the traditionally \\"pretty\\" conformation, having a large and unrefined head, and upright shoulder that produces short and choppy strides. The chest and back are narrow, although the neck is usually of a good length. The ponies usually range from 12-13 hands. Both the conformation and the coloration produce a pony that looks similar to the Przewalski's Horse.  Breed history  Its roots are unknown, although one theory is that ponies of ancient stock were brought to Indonesia by the Chinese in the 6th century. If this theory is true, the Bali pony would owe much of its roots to the Mongolian horse. In addition to the Mongolian horse, it is known that some Indian stock were taken to Indonesia (although it is unknown exactly which breeds), and the Dutch also brought various eastern breeds to the country during the 18th century. Therefore, the Bali pony likely has been influenced by both the Mongolian horse, and various other eastern breeds.  Uses  The Bali pony has not been selectively bred for any particular set of characteristics. However, they easily perform the tasks required by the native people, including carting coral and stones from the beach. Their strength has also made them a popular mount for trekking and sightseeing tourists.

The Neuron synthesizer used an Artificial Neural Network to create a digital computer model from sampled sounds, implementing a new synthesis technology which was developed by Stephan Bernsee at Prosoniq. This computer model could then be used to resynthesize a new sound, giving the player control over \\"musical\\" aspects such as instrument body size, material and other acoustic properties. This parametric approach is very different from the more mathematical approaches of other synthesizers. The Hartmann Neuron VS, a Mac/Windows compatible VST software version of the instrument, was released in 2005. Critique Even though the instrument was awarded numerous prizes for innovation it was difficult to operate due to its limited display capabilities, which made adjusting the tonal qualities of a sound a tedious trial and error process. Given the very high price of the instrument (around 5000 USD) many people felt that manipulating a wireframe model of a sound only by ear did not allow for the amount of control necessary for such a complex operation. However, combined with a sample editor, the included Modelmaker software & MIDI control via sequencing, this difficulty can be somewhat rectified, albeit without the aid of the 3D image of the model. Hartmann Music had to fight a couple of technical problems which were never remedied before the company finally filed for insolvency, after a dispute with their distributor, in 2005.http://www.sonicstate.com/news/2005/10/28/hartmann- rumours-spread Although Hartmann Music went out of business, the Neuron synthesizer is still a sought after, hard-to-find instrument with unique sound. It is still being used today, mainly in the production of film music, for example by artists like Hans Zimmer and electronic musicians such as BT or The Arcane Paradigm. Technology The Neuron synthesizer's hardware was based around a standard PC mainboard running an early version of the Gentoo Linux operating system. A custom application ran the sound synthesis algorithm, and the instrument used custom front panel displays and a custom sound card. The front panel and the casing of the synthesizer were designed by Axel Hartmann. It featured 3 orange stick controllers which allowed simultaneous manipulation of 2 assignable parameters (X/Y direction). There were 2 oscillators per voice (called \\"Resynators\\") which were split in two parameter groupings: \\"Scape\\" would refer to the generation properties of a sound (such as the excitation source in a real instrument), \\"Sphere\\" would contain all parameters referring to the properties of the resonating \\"instrument\\" body. The two Resynators could be combined and put through a \\"Blender\\", which allowed different modes to be applied in the combination. The Neuron synthesizer also had an effects unit with EQ, delay, modulation, distortion, ring modulation, reverb and spectral warping effects, a digital filter with variable cutoff frequency, resonance and selectable characteristics, and assignable control wheels. Construction Internally, the motherboard is a Shuttle MV25(N) Socket 370, VIA Apollo chipset with an Intel Celeron CPU, heatsink & fan. The motherboard can accept up to 2x 512MB of non-ECC PC133 SDRAM, although the system comes with 256MB as standard. The hard disk is a PC standard 20GB IDE unit. The audio & data PCI i/o board is a custom Hartmann design & on-ribbon includes; MIDI, USB & the first 5.1 surround sound hardware to be incorporated into a hardware synthesiser. The PSU is a non-ATX design, although the exhaust fan is a standard PC part. The exhaust fan, however, is noisy in operation and may not be acceptable in the confines of a soundproofed mixing room. Externally, the casing is extremely solid, heavy-duty aluminium chassis with a wooden end panel. The one drawback are the four delicate plastic joysticks. However, these can be removed for transport.

Early life and governmental career Carlos Arturo Ju√°rez was born in La Banda on 6 February 1916. He was first elected governor in 1948 during the presidency of Juan Per√≥n, and served from 1949 to 1952, and from 1973 to 1976. Ju√°rez was re-elected governor in 1983 following the restoration of democracy, and served three terms: 1983‚Äì1987, 1995‚Äì1998, and 1999‚Äì2001. Ju√°rez's wife, Mercedes Aragon√©s de Ju√°rez, was a minister in his administration and became governor herself in 2002, serving until federal intervention removed her in 2004. Her removal came after allegations of involvement in corruption and murder. Aragon√©s had named her husband Justice Minister in an attempt to grant him immunity. Murder investigation In February 2003, a key investigation was launched into the murders of two young women, Leyla Nazar and Patricia Villalba. There were allegations that relatives of local political leaders were involved in the killings and other acts of violence, protected by Ju√°rez. Former provincial intelligence chief Antonio Musa Azar was imprisoned, and his testimony implicated the Ju√°rez family in connection with a number of crimes. In October 2003, investigators produced a report documenting more than 500 complaints of illegal acts and human rights violations, even against children as young as nine years old. The report unleashed a further wave of accusations. Officials found files on around 40,000 political figures and others who were spied on and persecuted by the police and the local intelligence service. The couple were accused of involvement in the death of bishop Gerardo Sueldo (a critic of the Ju√°rez regime), who died allegedly by accident in a car crash in 1998. The family of former governor C√©sar Iturre (1987‚Äì1991), who had been a Ju√°rez ally but who later became opposed to Juarez, also accused the duo of involvement in his death in Paraguay. Arrest Aragon√©s and Ju√°rez were placed under house arrest. She was charged with fiscal fraud and the murder of Iturre. He was charged with involvement in the disappearance of a national deputy in 1976. The Ju√°rez hegemony over Santiago del Estero has apparently ended. Nevertheless it was suggested that they helped the Radical Civic Union win the governorship of the Santiago del Estero Province for the first time in 2003, with Gerardo Zamora as the UCR candidate, and had also backed president N√©stor Kirchner's bid for re-election in 2007.

The achievements of the scientist are: The Szondi test, Fate analysis and Fate psychology. Biography Szondi was born in city of Nyitra (in present-day Slovakia) and raised in a German and Slovak-speaking Jewish family. The original name of the family was Sonnenschein.Dr. Enik≈ë Gy. Kiss. \\"Fate-analysis ‚Äì the life sketch of Lip√≥t Szondi\\".University of P√©cs,Department of Personality, Developmental and Clinical Psychology. He was born as the twelfth child in his father's second marriage. The family moved to Budapest in 1898. His mother, who died very soon, was remembered by the family as an illiterate, unwholesome woman who had to be supervised by the elder siblings during her depressive periods. The father himself had a huge impact on Szondi, influencing his fate- analytical works to a great extent.http://szondialapitvany.hu/index.php/cikkek?download=5:fate-analysis- the-life-sketch-of-lipot-szondi These are his own words about his father: \\"My father was a Jewish shoemaker, who spent most of his time studying the Jewish Holy Scriptures, supposedly Talmudic and Hasidic ones. I was five when the family moved to Budapest, and my elder brothers and sisters had to provide for the family, while my father contributed as an assistant rabbi during the service on big Jewish feasts. In such an environment I was raised to be religious. I was eighteen when he died, right before graduation. I used to say the prayer called Kaddish every morning and evening due to Jewish customs in front of the communion for a whole year. This was the time when my ego had internalized my father. These deep patterns were the ones leading me in my academic works later on, even when I had already given up the dogmatic customs of the Jewish religion. I still remained a Jew, a devoted one. Hence the role of belief function supposedly has a strong connection with me being brought up in a religious manner.\\"Szondi, Leopold (1973): Schicksalsanalyse ‚Äì eine Selbstdarstellung In: Psychoterapie in Selbstdarstellungen. Herausgeben von Prof. Dr. phil. Ludwig J. Pongratz, Bern, Verlag Hans Huber In June 1944, he was deported with his family to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on the Kastner train. After 1700 American intellectuals paid a large ransom to Adolf Eichmann, Szondi, his family, and other prominent intellectuals were released to Switzerland in December 1944, where Szondi continued to live after the war. In 1961, the test developed by Szondi was used by Israeli judges to test the same Adolf Eichmann during his 1961 trial.\\"Jos√© Brunner, \\"Eichmann's Mind: Psychological, Philosophical,and Legal Perspective,\\" Theoretical Inquiries in Law 1,2(2000):429-463\\". By then, Szondi was widely acknowledged as an internationally renowned psychoanalyst, who had sought a third way between Sigmund Freud and Carl Gustav Jung. While Freud has focused on the individual unconscious, and Jung on the collective unconscious, Szondi privileged what he called \\"the family unconscious.\\" The heart of his theory was the claim that the genes of our ancestors are present in our unconscious and influence our choices. Connecting with our collective unconscious through his method called \\"Fate Analysis,\\" Szondi claimed, would allow us to achieve a higher degree of liberty, as we become free to follow or reject the \\"fatal\\" impulses coming from the presence of the ancestors in our psychic field.Richard Hughes, Return of the Ancestor, Bern: Peter Lang, 1992. Szondi never achieved the fame of Freud and Jung, but by the time of his death in 1986 he had gathered a loyal following. In 1969, the Szondi Institute had been established in Zurich to preserve his writings, papers, and legacy.\\"Szondi-Institut\\" Scientific activity One of the basic notions of the fate-analysis‚Äô concept is the ancestral (family) unconscious. Despite the fact that Leopold Sondi does not look into ‚Äúmemory‚Äù, ‚Äúmemory problems‚Äù notions in his works, according to modern research in the field of human memory, the ancestral unconscious, which differs from other types of unconscious in its content and purpose, determines the structure of human memory.

The battle involved the deployment of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 4th Army Corps for the first time, against determined units of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in Ph∆∞·ªõc Long in B√¨nh Ph∆∞·ªõc Province near the Cambodian border (to be distinguished from the other Ph∆∞·ªõc Long in B·∫°c Li√™u Province, south of Saigon), under the command of Lieutenant General D∆∞ Qu·ªëc ƒê·ªëng.Spencer C. Tucker Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War Oxford On December 12, 1974, the PAVN 4th Army Corps launched their campaign against Ph∆∞·ªõc Long aiming to achieve three key objectives. Firstly, North Vietnamese leaders wanted to test the reaction of the United States Government, to see if they would actually uphold former President Richard Nixon's promises of military retaliation against North Vietnam. Secondly, PAVN field commanders wanted to test the combat readiness of the ARVN. And thirdly, the North Vietnamese wanted to solve their logistical problems once and for all, by capturing the district of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long and the important transportation routes around it.Stanley Karnow, 1997 The PAVN campaign proved to be a major success, because the fall of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long showed that the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War was truly over, especially when the United States Congress repeatedly voted against additional aid for South Vietnam. Militarily, the victory at Ph∆∞·ªõc Long also enabled the North Vietnamese to expand their logistical routes from the Central Highlands of South Vietnam to the Mekong Delta, which placed enormous pressure on the South Vietnamese military. Background During the Vietnam War, the district of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long played an important role in the defensive posture of the ARVN. Ph∆∞·ªõc Long is about 120 km north of Saigon; it shared a border with the South Vietnamese districts of B√¨nh Long in the west, Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c in the east, and Long Kh√°nh District in the south. Ph∆∞·ªõc Long also shares an international border with Cambodia. The district of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long and the military zones of B·ªë ƒê·ª©c, ƒê√¥n Lu√¢n, ƒê·ª©c Phong, the administrative centre of Ph∆∞·ªõc B√¨nh, and B√† R√° mountain lay at the centre of South Vietnam's defensive line in III Corps, which served to defend Saigon and the populous southern provinces.Duong Hao, 1980 Route 14, which ran through the district of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long and other key military zones, was an important North Vietnamese transportation route which linked the Ho Chi Minh trail with other Communist- occupied territories in South Vietnam. For that reason, regular units of the ARVN in Ph∆∞·ªõc Long were able to disrupt North Vietnamese supply lines. Due to the vulnerability of their supply lines in Ph∆∞·ªõc Long and the surrounding areas, the PAVN in L·ªôc Ninh and in the Central Highlands, often found themselves isolated from their comrades in the southern provinces of South Vietnam. The PAVN had closed surface travel from Saigon to Ph∆∞·ªõc Long by the direct route through B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng Province, during the Easter Offensive in 1972 and the only land access available to the South Vietnamese was via Ban Me Thuot and Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c. The PAVN attempted to sever this route during the Battle of Quang Duc from 30 October to 10 December 1973 but were repulsed by the ARVN. Combatants North Vietnam On July 20, 1974, the PAVN High Command created the 4th Army Corps for the purpose of capturing Ph∆∞·ªõc Long from the opposing South Vietnamese. Major General Hoang Cam was appointed as the first commander of the 4th Army Corps. The main body of the 4th Army Corps included the 3rd and 7th Infantry Divisions. The 165th, 201st and 271st Regiments formed the 3rd Infantry Division, while the 2nd, 141st and 209th Regiments formed the 7th Division. In addition, the aforementioned units were supported by the 429th Special Forces Regiment, the 25th Engineers Regiment, the 210th and 235th Logistical Groups and the Viet Cong (VC) 9th Division. The North Vietnamese campaign against Ph∆∞·ªõc Long was planned to take place in two separate phases. In the first phase PAVN/VC forces would capture the military zones surrounding Ph∆∞·ªõc Long which included Bu Dang, Bu Na, Bo Duc, Duc Phong, Don Luan, and ARVN firebases around Ba Ra mountain. In the second phase PAVN/VC units would launch a frontal assault, aimed directly at the district of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long, the administrative centre of Ph∆∞·ªõc Binh and the strategically important Ba Ra mountain. In both phases of operation, the PAVN would have to secure Route 14 in order to prevent reinforcements, which could have come in the form of the ARVN 5th, 18th or 25th Infantry Divisions. South Vietnam South Vietnam's main defensive assets in and around Ph∆∞·ªõc Long included five security battalions and forty-eight platoons of civilian self-defence forces. The defence of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long was the responsibility of ARVN Lieutenant General D∆∞ Qu·ªëc ƒê·ªëng. The 341st and 352nd Security Battalions were tasked with the defence of Don Luan, the 363rd Security Battalion stationed at Bu Na, the 362nd Security Battalion guard the main roads from Vinh Thuan to Bu Dang, and the 340th Security Battalion was placed in reserve at Ph∆∞·ªõc Long district. The 341st, 352nd and 363rd Security Battalions all shared the responsibility of protecting Route 14 and the adjoining roads. Firepower support came in the form of one artillery battalion, which was based at the centre of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long District, equipped with 150mm and 155mm artillery guns.Cao Van Vien, 1983 Like during the Easter Offensive the strongest units of the ARVN in III Corps could be deployed to defend Ph∆∞·ªõc Long from potential attacks, which included three infantry divisions (5th, 18th and 25th) and two armoured units (2nd and 7th Armoured Brigade). In an emergency the 18th Infantry Division based at Bi√™n H√≤a could reach Ph∆∞·ªõc Long in the shortest period of time, and the next closest unit was the 5th Infantry Division based at B·∫øn C√°t. In addition, Lieutenant General D∆∞ Qu·ªëc ƒê·ªëng could have access to the 81st Airborne Ranger Battalion and more than one hundred helicopters, mainly UH-1 Huey and CH-47 Chinook models. While air support could come in the form of fighter-bombers from the 3rd and 5th Air Divisions of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF), based at Tan Son Nhut Air Base and Bien Hoa Air Base. Prelude The PAVN opened its campaign against Ph∆∞·ªõc Long on December 12, 1974, using the 4th Battalion of the 165th Infantry Regiment to attack a South Vietnamese outpost located on Route 14, which was defended by a single South Vietnamese security company. On the same night the military zone of B√π ƒê·ªëp was also attacked by a company of Viet Cong special forces from the Ph∆∞·ªõc B√¨nh area. During the next few days the ARVN managed to recapture its positions along Route 14, but they could not clear the main road. On December 13 ARVN Colonel Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªëng Th√†nh inspected the Route 14 area, and decided to raise the level of alertness from code 'yellow' to 'orange' for all South Vietnamese installations in the area. Due to the heavy rain which flooded the main roads leading to Ph∆∞·ªõc Long, the PAVN decided to postpone further attacks which were planned to take place on December 13.Hoang Cam, 2001\\" On December 14, the 271st Regiment of the PAVN 3rd Division launched their attack on the ARVN 362nd Security Battalion, also based in B√π ƒê·ªëp. After two hours of fighting nearly all members of the 2/271st Regiment had managed to penetrate the South Vietnamese defensive line around B√π ƒê·ªëp, and by 11.30am the 271st Regiment successfully overwhelmed the B√π ƒê·ªëp military zone.History of 4th Army Corp-Cuu Long Army Corp, 2004\\" On the same day, after a night of encirclement, the PAVN 165th and 201st Regiments, both drawn from the 7th Infantry Division, established control over the Vinh Thien area and the Bu Dang administrative centre after more than two hours of fighting. On December 15, soldiers from the PAVN 429th Special Forces Regiment attacked Bu Na, which was defended by one ARVN company from the 363rd Security Battalion, and an artillery platoon. The 363rd Security Battalion, with strong support from RVNAF fighter-bombers based at Bien Hoa Air Base, fought back fiercely in their attempt to defend Bu Na. However, by the end of the day South Vietnamese defenders around Bu Na gave up, when reinforcements from Ph∆∞·ªõc Long failed to arrive due to the closure of Route 14 by the PAVN. On December 16, Lieutenant General D∆∞ Qu·ªëc ƒê·ªëng flew out to Ph∆∞·ªõc Long to assess the situation around the area, and to bolster the defences of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long with the 2/7th Regiment, from the ARVN 5th Infantry Division. On the same day, South Vietnamese Colonel Do Cong Thanh also organised a number of counter-attacks against North Vietnamese positions around Route 14, which connects with the Bu Dang area, but on each on occasion they were pushed back by local Viet Cong units who were guarding the area. Several days later on December 22, the ARVN 341st Security Battalion at B·ªë ƒê·ª©c was attacked for the second time by the PAVN 165th Regiment. Subsequently, South Vietnamese units at Ph∆∞·ªõc T√≠n, Ph∆∞·ªõc Qu·∫£, and Ph∆∞·ªõc L·ªôc were also overwhelmed by the PAVN. The ARVN attempted to stage a counter-attack on Bo Duc, but they were defeated by the PAVN 6/165th Regiment, as a result all surviving South Vietnamese units retreated back to the Ba Ra area.Hoang Cam, 2001 Two days later General D∆∞ Qu·ªëc ƒê·ªëng tried to reinforce Ph∆∞·ªõc Long with a regiment from the ARVN 18th Infantry Division, but President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu overturned General ƒê·ªëng's decision on the basis that all deployments at the regimental-level must be made by Thi·ªáu himself. As a result, Lieutenant General D∆∞ Qu·ªëc ƒê·ªëng had to order Brigadier General L√™ Nguy√™n Vƒ© to reinforce the areas around ƒê·ªìng Xo√†i with units taken from the ARVN 5th Infantry Division. However, by the time regular ARVN units arrived at their destination, the PAVN had already encircled the Don Luan military zone, so it was within range of the formidable PAVN long-range artillery guns. Even though the ARVN received extensive air support they could only send one company into ƒê·ªìng Xo√†i, so Brigadier General L√™ Nguy√™n Vƒ© was forced to withdraw his forces from the area. At 5.37am on December 26, 1974, the PAVN 141st Regiment opened their attack on the ARVN base at ƒê√¥n Lu√¢n from four different directions, after 15 minutes of artillery bombardment from supporting artillery units. Due to the strong presence of PAVN artillery, ARVN artillery units at Don Luan were simply overwhelmed. In addition, the high calibre anti-aircraft guns used by the PAVN 20th Air-Defence Battalion also limited the effectiveness of the RVNAF air support. At 10.30am all ARVN units at ƒê√¥n Lu√¢n capitulated and Major ƒê·∫∑ng V≈© Kho√°i, commander of the 352nd Security Battalion, was captured at Suoi Rat along with his junior officers. Towards the end of the day, the PAVN 141st Regiment also captured other South Vietnamese installations at Ta Be, Ph∆∞·ªõc Thi·ªÅn and a helicopter base. In just two weeks the PAVN had managed to punch several holes in the defensive line of South Vietnam's III Corps, with the capture of B√π ƒê·ªëp, B√π Na, B√π ƒêƒÉng and ƒê√¥n Lu√¢n. For the ARVN, the loss of four important outposts in III Corps was a severe blow, especially with opposing PAVN and Viet Cong forces controlling all main roads leading to the district of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long such as Route 14, Route 7, and the provincial roads 1 and 2. The ARVN, based at the administrative centre of Ph∆∞·ªõc B√¨nh and Ph∆∞·ªõc Long, suddenly found themselves surrounded by the PAVN 4th Army Corps. Fall of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long To halt the North Vietnamese onslaught at Ph∆∞·ªõc Long, Lieutenant General D∆∞ Qu·ªëc ƒê·ªëng need at least one infantry division and one unit of armoured cavalry, however ARVN infantry divisions based in III Corps were not allowed to be deployed without the approval of President Thi·ªáu. On December 29, realising that the district of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long was in serious danger of being overrun, General Cao VƒÉn Vi√™n asked President Thi·ªáu to approve a plan to defend Ph∆∞·ªõc Long that had been prepared back in October 1974. Shortly afterwards General Cao VƒÉn Vi√™n received a message from President Thi·ªáu which advised Lieutenant General D∆∞ Qu·ªëc ƒê·ªëng not to make discretionary decisions, and to try to maintain the morale of the South Vietnamese soldiers at Ph∆∞·ªõc Long. While Lieutenant General D∆∞ Qu·ªëc ƒê·ªëng was desperate to find additional reinforcements, the North Vietnamese were making their way towards Ph∆∞·ªõc Long and Ph∆∞·ªõc B√¨nh between December 27 and December 30, 1974. On the afternoon of December 30, PAVN units took up their positions in the following order: the 165th Regiment was positioned on the south and south-eastern areas of Ph∆∞·ªõc B√¨nh, the 141st Regiment was positioned along provincial road no. 2 in the north and northwest leading towards Ph∆∞·ªõc B√¨nh, the 271st Regiment blocked Route 309, the 16th Regiment moved from T√¢y Ninh to the north of Song Be, the 78th Special Forces Battalion gathered near the foot of Ba Ra mountain, while the 2nd and 209th Regiments were placed in reserve. In addition the PAVN 4th Army Corps was strengthened with one artillery company equipped with 130 mm artillery guns, and two armoured companies with 14 T-54 tanks. On December 31, 1974, as Lieutenant General D∆∞ Qu·ªëc ƒê·ªëng received President Thi·ªáu's message, the PAVN began their final assault on the district of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long with the 165th Regiment, the 141st Regiment, the 3rd Battalion and several local Viet Cong units leading the attack. However, due to the slow deployment of the 78th Special Forces Battalion and the 271st Regiment, ARVN artillery at Ph∆∞·ªõc Long were able to respond to initial PAVN assaults, by pounding PAVN positions around Ba Ra mountain. Furthermore, the ARVN 1/7th Regiment, 5th Infantry Division, also attacked the PAVN 5th and 6th Battalions, both belonging to the 165th Regiment, at the foot of Ba Ra mountain. As a result, the 141st Regiment had to attack the administrative centre of Ph∆∞·ªõc B√¨nh by itself, while 165th Regiment was forced to stop in order to deal with the South Vietnamese counter-attack. At 1 pm on December 31, PAVN Major General Hoang Cam sent four T-54 tanks to support the 141st Regiment, but one of the tanks was put out of action when it hit a landmine. The 141st Regiment, with three remaining T-54 tanks in support, were able to force their way into the centre of Ph∆∞·ªõc B√¨nh and capture the local airfield. By 3 pm, the administrative centre of Ph∆∞·ªõc B√¨nh had fallen, and the ARVN 2/7th Regiment was pushed back towards Soui Dung.History of the 7th Infantry Division, 2006 Meanwhile, on the evening of December 31, the RVNAF had flown more than 50 bombing sorties against PAVN positions at the foot of Ba Ra mountain, temporarily stopping attacks from the PAVN 78th Special Forces Battalion. The PAVN responded to RVNAF attacks by rolling out their long-range anti-aircraft guns, which stopped RVNAF pilots from hitting PAVN positions until the next day, and allowing the 78th Special Forces Battalion to capture Ba Ra mountain. The capture of Ba Ra mountain enabled PAVN units to occupy the high ground areas surrounding Ph∆∞·ªõc Long, where they could direct artillery fire against ARVN positions. Throughout the day on January 1, 1975, the RVNAF conducted a further 53 bombing sorties, again temporarily delaying the PAVN attack on Ph∆∞·ªõc Long. By the end of the day, RVNAF pilots claimed to have destroyed 15 North Vietnamese tanks. On the other side, the ARVN lost eight 105 mm and four 155 mm artillery guns during the initial PAVN assault on Ph∆∞·ªõc B√¨nh, and, by the early hours of January 2, 1975, all of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long was within range of PAVN artillery. Realising that the South Vietnamese defenders were in danger of being destroyed, ARVN Colonel Do Cong Thanh quickly reorganised all his units. Subsequently, the headquarters of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long district was moved to Camp Le Loi, the 340th Security Battalion had to defend the bridges at Suoi Dung, and the 2/7th Regiment took up their positions along the main streets of Tu Hien 1 and Tu Hien 2. As a result, the South Vietnamese were able to put up fierce resistance, thus delaying the advancing PAVN for another 24 hours. On the morning of January 2, 1975, PAVN artillery bombarded ARVN positions in Ph∆∞·ªõc Long for about an hour, to pave the way for further assaults from the 141st, 165th and 271st Regiments. In the south of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long, the 165th Regiment successfully captured the ARVN camp of Doan Van Kieu, in the west the 141st Regiment clashed with the ARVN 1/9th Regiment at Ho Long Thuy, and in the southeast the 271st Regiment were able to secure Tu Hien 1 and Tu Hien 2. On the morning of January 3, elements of the 141st Regiment made their way into the district of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long, only to find the town isolated. The PAVN 4th Army Corps then decided to bolster the strength of the 141st Regiment, with one battalion taken from the 201st Regiment. To deal with the PAVN, Lieutenant General Do Quoc Dong attempted to land the 8/5th Infantry Division in the district of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long using helicopters, but fierce anti-aircraft fire from the PAVN 210th Air-Defence Regiment forced the helicopters to turn around. At the same time, RVNAF transport planes also tried to drop ammunition supplies for ARVN soldiers in the northern areas of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long, but the ammunition load landed in the wrong place and was captured by the PAVN. Due to the heavy artillery barrage, the ARVN headquarters at Ph∆∞·ªõc Long was heavily damaged with the district's deputy commander dead of his wounds, while the commander of Ph∆∞·ªõc B√¨nh suffered severe injuries. On the morning of January 4, the RVNAF resumed their attacks on PAVN columns, forcing them to slow their attacks. In his last-ditch effort to save Ph∆∞·ªõc Long, Lieutenant General D∆∞ Qu·ªëc ƒê·ªëng ordered the 81st Ranger Battalion to be airlifted into action. But as soon as the first group of the 81st Ranger Battalion landed on Dac Song, they were quickly decimated by PAVN artillery, with the unit suffering losses equivalent to two companies. The PAVN 4th Army Corps command immediately responded by ordering the 16th Regiment to secure Dac Song and the nearby bridge at Dac Lung, pursuing the surviving elements of the 81st Ranger Battalion. However, by that stage South Vietnamese defence lines in Ph∆∞·ªõc Long had narrowed, leaving only the administrative centre and the local markets still under South Vietnamese control, while most of the town had fallen to the PAVN. On January 5, the PAVN 165th and 201st Regiments continued their encirclement of the Ph∆∞·ªõc Long administrative centre, as well as shelling key targets in the area. On the following day, the PAVN 4th Army Corps command sent the 201st Regiment, along with ten additional tanks, to reinforce the units already fighting in Ph∆∞·ªõc Long and to cut off the South Vietnamese route of escape, Cach Mang and Dinh Tien Hoang streets were blocked. At 8 pm on January 6, the last ARVN defensive post, occupied by the surviving elements of the 81st Ranger Battalion, was captured by the PAVN. During the night a small number of ARVN soldiers who had survived the battle were evacuated from Ph∆∞·ªõc Long. At the battle's conclusion, the North Vietnamese claimed they had captured 2,444 prisoners, including 26 officers, 5,000 small arms of various kinds and more than 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition. Aftermath Military effect The ARVN in Ph∆∞·ªõc Long, under the command of Lieutenant General D∆∞ Qu·ªëc ƒê·ªëng, used everything they had at their disposal in order to stop the PAVN onslaught. In their efforts to save Ph∆∞·ªõc Long and other territories around the district, the South Vietnamese lost more than a thousand soldiers killed in action and 2,444 others were captured. The sacrifice of the ARVN in the battle was exemplified by the 250-men 81st Airborne Ranger Battalion, which lost more than 150 soldiers in their last-ditch effort to save Ph∆∞·ªõc Long. In the end, about 850 South Vietnamese soldiers were evacuated from the battlefield. In comparison to their South Vietnamese counterparts, the casualties suffered by the PAVN 4th Army Corps were relatively light with about 1,300 killed or wounded. In logistical terms the victory at Ph∆∞·ªõc Long enabled the PAVN to connect their supply lines from the Ho Chi Minh Trail, with bases in the Central Highlands and the Mekong Delta. At the same time, with a strengthened supply line which stretched from the north to the southern provinces of South Vietnam, the PAVN were able to apply additional pressure on the weakened ARVN already starved of American supplies. Political effect In Hanoi, the capture of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long provided the Communist leadership with clear answers about America's commitment to defend South Vietnam, as well as their willingness to re-enter the conflict. The Battle of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long not only gave North Vietnamese political and military planners a greater awareness of South Vietnam's dire military situation, but it also showed that the United States government were no longer interested in the survival of the Saigon regime. Thus, the optimism and confidence of North Vietnamese leaders were significantly strengthened, because they could finally destroy the Saigon regime and win the war once and for all. The lessons learned at Ph∆∞·ªõc Long were put into practice during the 1975 Spring Offensive, which ultimately led to the political and military capitulation of South Vietnam on April 30, 1975. In Saigon, the loss of Ph∆∞·ªõc Long exposed the severe weaknesses of the ARVN. For General Cao VƒÉn Vi√™n, Chief of the ARVN, the military situation was clear: if South Vietnamese units could not hold their own against a single attack, there was no way they could ever stop a large-scale invasion. To make matters worse, the United States Congress repeatedly voted against President Gerald Ford's request to give additional aid for South Vietnam. On January 10, 1975, President Thi·ªáu called on the people of South Vietnam to pray for Ph∆∞·ªõc Long, as well as renew their determination to retake the district. One month later, Thi·ªáu reinforced his previous message by asking the people of South Vietnam to maximise their support of soldiers on the frontline, stabilise the country's internal situation, and increase economic production.

Females are included in the list where appropriate; however, although the Crown could pass through the female line (for example to the House of Dunkeld in 1034), in the Early Middle Ages it is doubtful whether a queen regnant would have been accepted as ruler. Heirs to Malcolm III Malcolm III, son of Duncan I defeated and killed Macbeth in 1057, who had usurped the throne upon the death of his father in 1040. His heir presumptive was his brother, *Donald, born around 1039. However, around 1060, Malcolm's wife Ingibiorg Finnsdottir gave birth to their first son, *Duncan. Unfortunately for Duncan, when Malcolm was killed in battle in 1093, Donald usurped the throne. Heirs to Donald III Donald of Scotland, brother of Malcolm III, usurped the throne upon the death of his brother in November 1093. Since Donald was childless and nearly all of his nephews were against him, his heir presumptive was the only nephew who supported him, *Edmund, born around 1070. Donald III was deposed by his nephew Duncan II in May 1094 but eventually regained his throne in November of the same year. In 1097, one of his nephews Edgar came in Scotland with the help of the English and imprisoned Donald III. Edmund was sent to a monastery until the end of his life. Heirs to Duncan II Duncan II, eldest son of Malcolm III, became King of Scotland in May 1094, when he deposed his uncle, King Donald III, with the help of King of England William II. Since Duncan was married to Ethelreda, his heir apparent was his son, *William, born around 1090. However, in November 1094, Donald III came back and killed Duncan II. William left Scotland with his mother in that year, to the safety of Allerdale in Cumberland. Heirs to Edgar Edgar, now eldest son of Malcolm III, became King of Scotland in 1097, with the military support of his uncle Edgar the √Ütheling who helped him to depose King Donald III. Since Edgar wasn't married, his heir presumptive was his next brother, *Alexander, ruler of Lothian and Forth, born around 1078. Heirs to Alexander I Alexander I, previously ruler of Lothian and Forth, became King of Scotland on the death of his elder brother Edgar, 8 January 1107. Since his marriage to Sybilla of Normandy was childless, his heir presumptive was his sole surviving brother, *David, ruler of Lothian and Cumbria, born around 1085. Heirs to David I David I, previously ruler of Lothian and Cumbria, became King of all Scotland on the death of his elder brother Alexander I, 23 April 1124. His heir apparent was his eldest surviving son, *Henry, born in 1114. On the death of his mother, Maud, he succeeded as Earl of Huntingdon in England. He died on 12 June 1152, during the life of his father, and his place in the succession passed to the eldest of his three sons, *Malcolm, born on 20 March 1141. He was immediately confirmed as heir apparent to the Crown and sent on a tour of the Kingdom under the guardianship of the Earl of Fife. David died on 24 May 1153 and was succeeded by his grandson. Heir to Malcolm IV Malcolm IV, known as \\"Malcolm the Maiden\\", was unmarried and had no children. His heir presumptive was his next brother *William, who succeeded as King on Malcolm's death, 9 December 1165. Heirs to William I William I was unmarried at the time of his accession, so the next heir was his younger brother, *David, who was made Earl of Huntingdon. He remained heir presumptive until the birth of his niece, *Margaret, born in 1193. She was the first child of King William by his wife Ermengarde de Beaumont, whom he had married on 5 September 1186. Another sister, Isabella, was born before the eventual arrival of a son, *Alexander, born on 24 August 1198, who was heir apparent from birth. William I, known as \\"William the Lion\\" from the lion rampant he adopted as his coat of arms, died on 4 December 1214, and was succeeded by his son. Heirs to Alexander II Alexander II was only sixteen and unmarried at the time of his succession, and so the heir presumptive was his elder sister, *Margaret, who married in 1221 Hubert de Burgh, Justiciar of England during the minority of King Henry III. When Henry came of age in 1227 Hubert was made Earl of Kent. Margaret, now Countess of Kent, continued as heir presumptive until the King fathered a child, *Alexander, born 4 September 1241, son of Alexander II by his second wife Marie de Coucy. Alexander II died on 8 July 1249 and was succeeded by his only legitimate child. Heirs to Alexander III Alexander III became king at the age of eight, and the heir presumptive to the kingdom was once again his aunt *Margaret, Countess of Kent. She was displaced in the succession by her namesake *Margaret, born to Alexander's queen Margaret of England on 28 February 1260. She was in turn displaced by the birth of her brother, *Alexander, Prince of Scotland, born on 21 January 1263. His death on 28 January 1283, and that of his younger brother David two years earlier, meant that his father's heir presumptive was again his elder sister *Margaret, by now married to King Eirik II of Norway. She died on 9 April 1283 giving birth to a daughter, *Margaret, known as \\"the Maid of Norway\\", who became heir presumptive. The King secured her recognition as such from the Estates of Scotland in 1284. Alexander III, a widower since 1274, was now left with an infant girl as the only undisputed successor to his throne. In an attempt to beget a male heir, he married Yolande de Dreux on 14 October 1285, but died on 19 March 1286 of a fall from his horse. Queen Yolande declared herself pregnant with the King's heir, but it soon became apparent that this was not the case, and Alexander's three-year-old granddaughter Margaret was recognised as heir. The Great Cause Scotland was ruled by the six Guardians of Scotland on behalf of the child-heir Margaret. However, other powerful nobles claimed the throne, and in an attempt to avoid a civil war the Regents appealed to King Edward I of England for assistance. By the Treaty of Birgham, 1290, Margaret was placed under Edward's guardianship and betrothed to his eldest son, the Prince of Wales. Margaret set out from Norway for Scotland in the autumn of that year, but was taken ill on the voyage and died at Orkney on 26 September 1290, age seven. Scotland was left without an heir and with two claimants, so the Guardians of Scotland again appealed to Edward I to act as an arbitrator between the Competitors for the Crown of Scotland. The two strongest claimants were *Dervorguilla of Galloway, died 1290 and was succeeded by her son: John de Balliol, grandson of Margaret of Huntingdon, the elder daughter of David, Earl of Huntingdon, the younger brother of King William the Lion (see above), and *Robert de Bruce, Lord of Annandale, son of Isobel of Huntingdon, Margaret of Huntingdon's younger sister. Though Bruce invoked proximity of blood and claimed to have been made Tanist of the Kingdom by the then-childless Alexander III, Balliol was the genealogically senior heir, and Edward declared in his favour following an election at Berwick-upon- Tweed, 3 August 1291. Heir to John King John was crowned at Scone on St Andrew's Day 1292. His heir apparent was his son by Isabella de Warenne, *Edward. On 23 October 1295 Edward was betrothed to Joan of Valois, the niece of Philip IV of France, when his father concluded an alliance with the French against Edward I, who had taken full advantage of his influential role in determining the Scottish succession to have himself made Lord Paramount of Scotland and John's feudal superior. In the treaty Edward was described as \\"future King of Scotland\\" and confirmed as the heir apparent to the Crown. In retaliation for this Treaty (the foundation of the Auld Alliance), Edward invaded Scotland, defeating the Scots at the Battle of Dunbar on 27 April 1296, and John was compelled to abdicate on 10 July 1296. He and his son were taken as prisoners to England, but he was still regarded by the Scots as rightful King of Scotland. William Wallace led an uprising in John's name, winning the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297, but the rebellion was crushed after the Battle of Falkirk the following year. In 1299 John was released from captivity and went into retirement on his family estates in France, taking no further interest in the recovery of his kingdom. His heirs still exist. Heirs to Robert I (The Bruce) After the Battle of Falkirk, William Wallace relinquished the position of Guardian of Scotland in favour of Robert de Bruce, Earl of Carrick and John Comyn of Badenoch (\\"the Red Comyn\\"), John Balliol's brother-in-law. These men had strong claims to the throne of Scotland themselves: Bruce was grandson of the Robert Bruce who had been a Competitor for the Crown in 1290, and Comyn had actually been a Competitor himself, as the senior descendant of the 11th century King Donald Bane. On 10 February 1306, Bruce murdered Comyn at what was supposed to be a parley between the two rivals, and set about claiming the throne for himself, being crowned at Scone on 27 March. Over the next years he gradually reconquered Scotland from the English, culminating in the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. He was finally recognised by the English as King of independent Scotland by the Treaty of Edinburgh‚ÄìNorthampton, 1328. At the time he seized the throne, Robert I had no sons, and the succession was not set out until the Parliament held at Ayr, which, on 27 April 1315, made Robert's brother, *Edward the heir, followed by Robert's daughter *Marjorie. In 1315 she married Walter, High Steward of Scotland; she died the following year a few hours after giving birth to their son *Robert, born 2 March 1316. In 1318 the Parliament of Scotland confirmed that he would succeed as king if his grandfather King Robert I died without sons. However, six years later *David was born, on 5 March 1324. He was son of King Robert I by his second wife Elizabeth de Burgh, and was thus heir apparent from birth. In 1328 he was created Earl of Carrick, the title held by his father before his accession. Robert I died on 7 June 1329, and was succeeded by his only surviving son (a second son, John, had died in infancy). Heir to David II David II was five years old when he became king. Though he married twice during his reign (firstly to Joan of the Tower and secondly to Margaret Drummond), he had no children, and so the heir presumptive for the duration of his reign was his older nephew *Robert, who had been designated heir in 1318. He had succeeded his father as High Steward of Scotland on 9 April 1326, and was created Earl of Atholl in 1342 and Earl of Strathearn in 1357. He was regent in the King's absence during the wars with England, but fell out with his uncle after he was accused of desertion at the Battle of Neville's Cross, at which David was captured. After David's release in 1357, the King made attempts to pay off some of his ransom by agreeing to bequeath the kingdom either to Edward III of England or to Edward's son Lionel of Antwerp. This would disinherit Robert, and in protest the Steward rose in rebellion in 1363, but was imprisoned with his sons, being released only shortly before the King's death. David II died on 22 February 1371, and was succeeded by his nephew Robert the Steward. Heir to Robert II (The Steward) Before he became king, Robert had married twice: firstly to Elizabeth Mure, by whom he had four sons and five daughters, and secondly to Euphemia, Countess of Moray, by whom he had a further two sons and two daughters. However, the children of the King's first wife had been born before the granting of the dispensation for the marriage, and were therefore of doubtful legitimacy, as the legal doctrine that children born out of wedlock are legitimated by their parents' subsequent marriage had not yet been fully established in Scotland. It was thus unclear whether the heir-apparent was Robert's eldest son by his first wife, John, or his eldest son by his second wife, David. On 27 March 1371, Parliament acknowledged John, as Robert's heir and subsequently on 4 April 1373 passed an Act specifically stating the order of succession to the throne, which was limited to the King's sons (named in the Act) and the heirs male of their bodies, failing which to the King's heirs whatsoever. The heir apparent was now indisputably *John Stewart, the King's eldest son by his first wife, who had been created Earl of Carrick in 1368. He was disabled by a kick from a horse in 1389, and his younger brother Robert took on many of the functions of the heir-apparent, including acting as Guardian of the Kingdom. Despite his infirmity, John succeeded to the throne on Robert II's death, 19 April 1390, in accordance with the 1371 Act. He assumed the regnal name of Robert III to avoid associations with the House of Balliol. Heirs to Robert III At Robert III's accession, his heir apparent was his eldest son *David, who became Earl of Carrick the same day. He was further created Duke of Rothesay and Earl of Atholl on 28 April 1398, the first creation of a Dukedom in Scotland. When David came of age in 1399, he was made Lieutenant of the Kingdom for his disabled father. This led to conflict with his uncle Robert, now Duke of Albany, who had previously filled that office. David was arrested by Albany and died in prison 26 March 1402, when his younger brother *James became heir apparent and Duke of Rothesay. To protect him from the same fate as his elder brother, he was sent to France in 1406, but was captured en route by the English and taken prisoner. Robert III died on 4 April 1406, allegedly of grief at his son's capture, and was succeeded as King by his only surviving son James (a second son, Robert, had died young). Heirs to James I The new eleven-year-old king had several sisters living, but under the 1371 Act of Parliament limiting the succession to males his heir presumptive was his uncle *Robert, Duke of Albany, who served as regent. The Duke of Albany made no effort whatsoever to secure the King's release from his English captors, and ruled Scotland himself until his death on 3 September 1420, when he was succeeded by his son *Murdoch as Duke of Albany and Regent of the Kingdom. Under Murdoch's regency the ransom on the King was finally paid, and James I returned to Scotland in 1424. However, the Albany family still had considerable power, and in an effort to regain full control of his Kingdom, James I had Murdoch and his son Sir Alexander Stewart attainted and beheaded on 25 May 1425 (Murdoch's eldest surviving son Sir Walter had been beheaded the day before). Murdoch's youngest son Sir James Stewart of Baldorran (called James M√≥r, or \\"the Fat\\"), fled to Ireland where he died in 1451, but he was disqualified from the succession by his father's attainder. The next male of the Stewart family was Murdoch's half-brother Robert Stewart, youngest son of the first Duke of Albany and de jure Earl of Ross following the death of his elder brother John the year before. He was still living in 1431, but the nearest male heir not of the Albany family was *Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl and Caithness, youngest son of King Robert II by his second wife and the last of James I's uncles. He was instrumental in James's return from England, and assisted in the trial of his Albany relatives. He was given a third Earldom (as Earl of Strathearn) on 22 July 1427, and remained as heir presumptive until the King fathered a son, *Alexander, Duke of Rothesay, on 16 October 1430. However the new heir died in infancy, leaving his twin brother *James as heir apparent and Duke of Rothesay. King James I was assassinated on 21 February 1437 by a group of conspirators including his uncle and sometime ally the Earl of Atholl, whereupon his infant son became king as James II. Heirs to James II At the accession of James II the next male heir to the Crown was the late King's assassin *Walter, Earl of Atholl. However, he and his grandson and accomplice Sir Robert Stewart, Master of Atholl were swiftly attainted and executed for their part in the conspiracy, 26 March 1437. The only other unquestionably legitimate male member of the House of Stewart apart from the King was now Sir James \\"M√≥r\\" Stewart of Baldorran, son of the second Duke of Albany, who was in exile in Ireland. However, as he was under attainder, the next heir according to the 1373 Act of Parliament was the \\"heir whomsoever\\" (i.e. including females) of King Robert II. It was still uncertain at this time as to who this would be, as the 1373 Act, while determining which of the King's sons should succeed him, had not pronounced on the legitimacy of the King's elder children one way or the other. If the children of Robert II by his first wife were legitimated by their parents' subsequent marriage (as later legal doctrine would have it), then the heir presumptive in 1437 was the King's eldest sister *Margaret, who had married the King of France's son the Dauphin Louis on 24 June 1436. She died without children on 16 August 1444, leaving her sister *Isabella as next heir. She was the wife of the Duke of Brittany, by whom she had two daughters. However she was displaced in the succession after her brother was married on 3 July 1449 to Mary of Guelders, who bore him the first of eight children, *a son, on 19 May 1450 (he died the same day, but seven surviving children followed). However, if the children of Elizabeth Mure were not legitimate, then the heir whomsoever of Robert II during the period 1437 to 1451 was *Malise Graham, Earl of Menteith, maternal grandson of David, Earl of Strathearn, the eldest son of King Robert II by his second, indisputably valid marriage to Euphemia de Ross. The Earl of Menteith was closely related on his father's side to the conspirators that murdered James I: his uncle Sir Robert Graham of Kilpont had been one of the leaders of the plot, and his cousin Elizabeth Graham was second wife to the treacherous Earl of Atholl. In the event this potential problem over the succession never arose, as Queen Mary gave birth to a son and heir apparent, *James, Duke of Rothesay, on 10 July 1451. After fathering three more sons, King James II, an artillery enthusiast, was killed by an exploding cannon while besieging Roxburgh Castle, 3 October 1460, and was succeeded by his eldest son. Heirs to James III James III was nine years old at his accession, and his heir-presumptive was his next brother *Alexander, who had been created Duke of Albany. He was next in line to the throne for the next twelve years, until the King begat a son, *James, Duke of Rothesay, on 17 March 1473. After the death in 1485 of the Duke of Albany, who had previously laid claim to the crown with English help as \\"Alexander IV\\", the Duke of Rothesay became the figurehead for nobles dissatisfied with the King's misrule. James III was killed in battle with the rebels at Sauchie Burn on 11 June 1488 and his son ascended the throne as James IV. Heirs to James IV At the accession of James IV his heir- presumptive was his next brother *James, Duke of Ross. He later became Archbishop of St Andrews and Chancellor of Scotland, and died in January 1504, when the position of heir-presumptive went to the next male member of the House of Stewart, *John, second Duke of Albany, the son of James II's second son Alexander. He continued as first in line to the throne until the birth of the King's first son *James, Duke of Rothesay, on 21 February 1507. However, this prince died on 27 February 1508, so *the Duke of Albany again became heir until the birth of a second son, *Arthur, Duke of Rothesay on 20 October 1509. He too only survived to the next year, leaving *Albany as heir from 14 July 1510 until 10 April 1512, when another son, *James, Duke of Rothesay, was born. James IV died the next year in battle at Flodden, 9 September 1513, and was succeeded as King by his only son (though another was born posthumously). Heirs to James V The new King's mother Margaret Tudor was still pregnant at his accession, so the unborn child was heir-presumptive. He was born on 30 April 1514 and given the name *Alexander and the title Duke of Ross. He only survived until 8 December 1515, so *the Duke of Albany again became heir- presumptive. He served intermittently as Regent for the young King, opposed by the Queen and her new husband the Earl of Angus, and later returned to France, where he died without issue on 2 July 1536. The King was now the only surviving male member of the Royal Family, as had been the case from 1437 to 1451, and it was arguable who should be legally next in line under the 1373 Act as heir general of Robert II (see above). The senior representative of Robert II's legitimate children by his second wife was *William Graham, third Earl of Menteith, the great-grandson of the first Earl who had been a possible heir-presumptive to James II. The senior representative of Robert II's legitimated children by his first wife was *James Hamilton, second Earl of Arran, grandson of James II's elder daughter Mary. He was a much closer relative of the King, and was regarded as heir-presumptive until the birth of the King's son *James, Duke of Rothesay on 22 May 1540. He and his brother Arthur, Duke of Albany both died in infancy, leaving *the Earl of Arran again as next in line until the birth of a daughter *Mary, on 8 December 1542. King James V died only days later on 14 December 1542 and Mary succeeded as Queen of Scots under the Earl of Arran's regency. This was not disputed by the contemporary Earl of Menteith, the other potential claimant. However, when the third Earl's great-grandson William was confirmed as Earl of Strathearn and heir-of-line of Robert II's eldest unquestionably legitimate son David in 1631, he began to boast that he had a better claim to the throne than the then King, Charles I. He was swiftly removed from his offices and deprived of the Earldom of Strathearn in 1633, being given the inferior title of Earl of Airth.For his heirs see Descendants of Sarah Ann Allardice wargs.com Heirs to Mary I (Queen Of Scots) The new Queen was only a few days old when she succeeded her father. The heir-presumptive was her kinsman *the Earl of Arran, who was named Regent. He became a leader of the pro-French party, being instrumental in arranging the marriage of the Queen to the eldest son of King Henry II of France, the Dauphin Francis, and was rewarded by the French king with the title of Duc de Ch√¢tellherault in 1548. In 1554 he surrendered the regency to the Queen's mother, Mary of Guise, in return for confirmation of his status as heir-presumptive. He later joined the Protestant faction, and tried to marry the widowed Queen to his son James, but retired to his estates in 1565 after Mary married her first cousin Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. The couple's first child, *James, Duke of Rothesay, was born on 19 June 1566 and was heir-apparent from that date. After Mary's third marriage to the Earl of Bothwell, the Lords of Scotland rose in rebellion against her, and on 24 July 1567 she was forced to abdicate in favour of her son, who became James VI. Heirs to James VI James VI was only one year old when he became king, and so the next heir at this time was once again *James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran. In 1568 he took part in a rebellion to restore Queen Mary to the throne, but was imprisoned in 1569. His release was secured by his eventual recognition of James as King in 1573, and died on 22 January 1575, leaving his eldest son, *James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran as successor to his titles and heir-presumptive to the Crown. The third Earl had been driven insane by his use as a pawn in his father's political machinations (his candidacy had been urged as a suitor for the hands of both the young Queen of Scots and Queen Elizabeth of England), and his younger brother John (later first Marquess of Hamilton) administered his estates. Kept in confinement, his earldom was removed from him in 1581 and assumed by the Chancellor of Scotland, James Stewart of Bothwellhaugh, but in 1585 his resignation was judged by the Court of Session to be the act of a madman and therefore invalid, and he was restored to the title. *Henry Frederick, the King's first child, was born on 19 February 1594 and was heir-apparent and Duke of Rothesay from birth. At his father's accession as King James I of England on 24 March 1603, he further became Duke of Cornwall in the Peerage of England, and was created Prince of Wales on 4 June 1610. Seen as having great promise as a future King, he died of typhoid on 6 November 1612, and was succeeded as heir-apparent by his brother *Charles, who had previously been created Duke of Albany and Duke of York. He became Duke of Rothesay and Duke of Cornwall on his brother's death, and was created Prince of Wales on 4 November 1616. King James VI and I died on 27 March 1625 and was succeeded as king by his son Charles. Heirs to Charles I Charles I was unmarried at his accession, so his elder sister *Elizabeth was heir presumptive. She had married the Elector Palatine Frederick V in 1613, but since his ill-fated reign as King of Bohemia in the winter of 1619-20 they had been living in exile at the Hague. Charles I's first child to survive birth, *Charles, Duke of Rothesay and Duke of Cornwall, was born to Queen Henrietta Maria on 29 May 1630. He was later also designated Prince of Wales. From 1646 he lived abroad, as the civil war in which his father was engaged was going badly. After being captured by the Parliamentarians, escaping and being re-captured, King Charles I was tried for high treason, and beheaded on 30 January 1649. Heir to Charles II Although prevented from succeeding in England, Charles II was proclaimed King in Scotland on 5 February 1649, although a promise was extracted from him to adhere to the terms of what became the Treaty of Breda. Despite disputes between the Royalists and the Covenanters, Charles was crowned on 1 January 1651. However, his forces were defeated in England at the Battle of Worcester and by the end of the year the King had fled to exile in France. Scotland ceased to be an independent nation and became part of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland under Oliver Cromwell on 16 December 1653. The deposition of Cromwell's son Richard in 1659 paved the way for the King's return, and Charles returned to the British Isles on 25 May 1660. Throughout the exile and reign of Charles II the heir-presumptive was his brother *James, Duke of York, who was created Duke of Albany in the Peerage of Scotland in December 1660. Charles II died on 6 February 1685, leaving many illegitimate children but no legitimate ones. He was accordingly succeeded by his brother, who became James VII (II of England). Heirs to James VII At the time of James's accession he had no heir-apparent; of the three sons born to his late wife Anne Hyde and the one born to second wife, Mary of Modena, only one had survived past the age of three. The heir-presumptive to the throne was therefore the King's eldest daughter *Mary. She had married her first cousin William III, Prince of Orange in 1677 and lived with him in the Netherlands. Her half-brother *James Francis Edward was born on 10 June 1688, and became heir-apparent, Duke of Rothesay and Duke of Cornwall at birth. The King's Roman Catholic faith and policy of religious tolerance towards Catholics, particularly the Declaration of Indulgence, alarmed the Anglican hierarchy in his realm of England. James's imprisonment of seven Bishops who protested at his policy, and then the birth of a Catholic male heir, which raised the prospect of a Catholic dynasty on the throne, led a group of English noblemen to invite the King's Protestant nephew and son-in-law, William of Orange, to invade. This became known as the Glorious Revolution, and resulted in James's flight to France in December 1688. The English Parliament declared the throne vacant and offered it to William and his wife Mary. All these events in England had no bearing on the constitutional situation in Scotland, and it was only on 11 April 1689, the day of William and Mary's coronation in England, that the Estates of Scotland declared that James VII was no longer King, and offered the Crown jointly to the King and Queen of England. They accepted on 11 May, becoming William II and Mary II of Scots. Heirs to William II and Mary II Since an illness in 1679, the new Queen had been barren, so she and her husband had no children to carry on the line. The Claim of Right Act was passed in April 1689, establishing the constitutional basis for the accession of William and Mary, and that they would reign jointly, and then that the survivor would reign alone. *King William II and Queen Mary II were therefore joint heirs-apparent to each other, as well as joint sovereigns. Queen Mary died on 28 December 1694, and King William became sole monarch of Scotland. Heir to William II The Claim of Right Act had determined that after the death of both William and Mary, and failing any issue born to both of them (any children born to William by a subsequent wife were placed further down the list), the Crown would next pass to Mary's sister *Anne, wife of Prince George of Denmark and the surviving Protestant daughter of James VII, who accordingly became heir-apparent. William II died on 8 March 1702, and was succeeded by his sister-in-law. Heirs to Anne At the time of her accession, Queen Anne was the last living descendant of Charles I who was a Protestant; her only child to survive past infancy, the Duke of Gloucester, had died in 1700. The succession aspect of the Claim of Right Act which had ensured her succession (and that of the Bill of Rights by which she succeeded in England) would therefore lapse on her death. The English Parliament had already found a solution to this by passing the Act of Settlement, which named Sophia, Electress of Hanover, the next-senior Protestant descendant of James I (VI of Scotland), as heir after Anne. The Estates of Scotland had made no such provision, so there was no heir to the Scottish throne. In 1703 the Estates passed a Bill reserving to themselves the right to choose the monarch from among the Protestant descendants of the Kings of Scots in the event of Anne's death without issue, but stating that this would not be the same person as succeeded to the English throne unless the independence of Scotland as a separate Kingdom could be assured. Royal Assent to the Bill was initially withheld, but after the Scots threatened to withdraw their troops presently engaged in the War of the Spanish Succession it was passed in 1704, becoming known as the Act of Security. The Parliament of England then passed the Alien Act 1705, which stopped all Scottish exports to England and English colonies, and enacted that Scots would be treated as foreigners in England, with severe consequences for the inheritance of Scottish-owned property in England. The Alien Act also said that these measures would not be enacted if the Act of Security was repealed or if Scotland entered into parliamentary union with England. The latter eventually took place with the passage of the Act of Union, and Scotland became part of the Kingdom of Great Britain on 1 May 1707. *Sophia, Electress of Hanover was the heir-presumptive to the new Kingdom, and her son became King as George I on Anne's death in 1714.

Flett, J S \\"One Hundred Years of the Geological Survey of Great Britain\\" (London: HMSO, 1937) Personal life Aubrey Strahan was born on 20 April 1852 in London. He was the fifth son of William Strahan and Anne Dorothea Strahan. He was raised at Blackmore Hall, near Sidmouth, until he went to Eton at the age of 13. He then went to St John's College, Cambridge (his father's college) in 1870. In May 1875 (the year of his graduation) he was employed in a temporary capacity by the Geological Survey, then headed by Andrew Ramsay, as an assistant geologist. He was to remain with the Survey for the rest of his professional life. He married Fannie Roscoe in 1886. At this time he was mostly working in the south of England, but in 1901 became District Geologist with responsibility for South Wales. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1903, became President of the Geology Section of the British Association in 1904, and was President of the Geological Society of London in 1913 and 1914. He was Director of the Survey from 1914 until his retirement in 1920. He lived in Goring-on-Thames until his death there in 1928.

From Strahan (1910)During his long career, Strahan contributed to over 30 memoirs of the Geological Survey, these mostly being detailed descriptions and explanations of the areas covered by individual sheets of the Geological Map. He also published many papers in academic journals. The work for which he is best known is the extensive series of surveys of the South Wales coalfield. He was always attracted by the economic aspects of the study of geology, and this is well-reflected in the coalfield work.See in particular the 1904 memoirs on South Wales listed below, and the 1908 work on anthracite He was known for the high quality of his mapping work. His appointment as Director of the Survey coincided with the outbreak of World War I, and he was responsible for adapting the survey to meet wartime needs. These included preparation of maps for the war zones (particularly relevant for areas of trench warfare); provision of staff, as geologist were needed in the field; and exploiting mineral resources for the raw materials and energy sources needed for war production.Strahan (1917) This work became the basis for a series of reports entitled Special Reports on the Mineral Resources of Great Britain, the first of which appeared in 1915 Full text of 3rd Edition (1923) available at Archive.org References Selected publications        External links * Aubrey Strahan M.A., K.B.E., D.Sc., F.R.S Category:1852 births Category:1928 deaths Category:Wollaston Medal winners Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge ","title":"Aubrey Strahan"},{"id":"5829421","title":"Montclair State University station"},{"id":"5829437","text":"Jack Weinstein may refer to: * Jack B.

The station was served seven times a day, three inbound morning trains to Hoboken Terminal and four outbound evening trains from Hoboken by the Montclair-Boonton Line from Monday to Friday. Located at the intersection of Notch Road and Long Hill Road, it was the second of three stations in Little Falls, the other two being Montclair State University and Little Falls, and was the first on the line to be strictly served by diesel trains. However, most trains bypassed this station and continued on to Little Falls (westbound) and Montclair State University (eastbound). The station was served by a single track with an unused side track. The last trains stopped at the station on January 15, 2010, at 7:41pm. Train service at Great Notch originated in 1873, as part of the Montclair Railway. Service to Caldwell began in 1891, when the Caldwell Railway opened, serving Great Notch, Overbrook Hospital, Verona, and Caldwell. The station at Great Notch was first constructed in 1905 as a double station building for the Erie Railroad. The station was a green and red building serving the New York and Greenwood Lake Railway, along with the Caldwell Branch. The station also used an old boxcar as a tool shed for maintenance. By the early 1970s, the station had fallen into disrepair, and by 1974, was repainted Erie Railroad- style red with the tool shed box car removed. The station was abandoned when the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad went out of business and was later picked up by New Jersey Transit. After making deals with the mayor of Little Falls, New Jersey Transit gave the station a one-year \\"trial\\" to attract ridership. Ridership went down, however, and so the trial was canceled on December 18, 2009. The town of Little Falls was contacted by New Jersey Transit at that time, reporting that the Great Notch station would be closed on January 17, 2010 due to the \\"anemic\\" ridership at the station.  History  The station's shelter. This replaced the former Erie Railroad building Train service at Great Notch originated with the introduction of the Caldwell Railway, a service that went from the community of Caldwell, New Jersey to the New York & Greenwood Lake Railway. Twelve trains a day served Caldwell, Verona and Overbrook Hospital. The station at Great Notch was deemed Caldwell Junction, inferring the junction between the two railways. The Great Notch station depot was built in 1905 for the New York & Greenwood Lake Railway, a subsidiary of the Erie Railroad. The station was built as a green-red \\"type five\\" frame structure. While the main building was 12' √ó 28' √ó 18' in size, the station also included an old boxcar used as a tool house. The box car was only 12' √ó 45' and served the station for several decades. The station was just east of the \\"GA\\" signal tower, which was built in 1900 to serve the junction of the Greenwood Lake Railway and its Caldwell Branch, heading eastward for the communities of Cedar Grove, Verona, Caldwell and Essex Fells. The station also served a local yard for train storage for the branch line via a wye. At Essex Fells, connections could be made for train service to Morristown via the Morristown and Erie Railroad. The Caldwell Railroad diverged from the current New Jersey Transit line about west of the New Jersey Transit Great Notch station and followed its own route to Caldwell. The station at Great Notch was more than just a building for people at the railroad. The station had a large water tower next to GA Signal and a potbelly stove. The station was tended by a husband and wife combination, serving the locals their daily newspapers and their mail. Great Notch did not receive mail delivery until the mid-1950s. Great Notch Station circa 1912 By the early 1970s, the Great Notch station, which was falling into disrepair, received a new paint job, changed from the red-green colors for the Erie Lackawanna to a new all red Erie Railroad paint scheme. The abandoned tool shed made out of the old wooden boxcar was also removed. Due to the removal of the tool boxcar, the propane tanks that heated the station building were also made visible. After the ending of the Erie- Lackawanna Railroad in 1976, the Great Notch station lay abandoned. In June 1979, the State of New Jersey began to remove the tracks for the Caldwell Branch, which also lay abandoned at Great Notch. Currently, what was the track leading to the Caldwell Branch is a siding. On April 16, 1988, the newly rehabilitated station building was destroyed by fire. The burned out structure was razed on April 23. New Jersey Transit, who owned the station depot, replaced it with glass structures to seat 90 people. During the construction of the Montclair Connection in 2001, the adjacent Great Notch Yard received a major upgrade, becoming a new state-of-the-art yard with new trains storage facilities. Closure The station looking towards Hackettstown prior to closure When Montclair State University station opened in 2004 and the Wayne Route 23 Transit Center's train platform opened in 2008, this made Great Notch one of three stations in Little Falls, and it did not nearly have the ridership either of the other two stations had. The opening of Montclair State University Station helped to pull away commuters from Great Notch due to its location very near it. The small parking lot facing the station had very little room for cars and a parking lot on the opposite side of the single tracked station was isolated from it by fencing. Further exacerbating the problem was that the small lot abutting Notch Road was not marked specifically for train passengers only. Great Notch had (and still has) a bus stop on the corner of Notch and Long Hill Roads that serves buses headed for Port Authority Bus Terminal, and commuters using the bus would park in the train station's parking lot (and still do, as it was never blocked off) and catch the bus up the street. In January 2008, without knowledge of the township council, New Jersey Transit announced further and drastic service cuts at Great Notch. The only train to serve outbound customers was a train leaving for Hoboken Terminal in the morning, and two trains from Hoboken would serve the station at night. The site at Great Notch station in July 2010, six months after the closing of the station by New Jersey Transit The future of the 103-year-old station was placed into further jeopardy on August 12, 2008, when New Jersey Transit announced to the community of Little Falls that they would possibly close the station as early as October 2008. A few days after the announcement, rebuttal by the community began to appear, with a public hearing was announced for September 3 to work on plans for Great Notch. The service with only one inbound train (to Hoboken) and two outbound trains (from Hoboken) was canceled on April 1, 2009. On that day, New Jersey Transit announced it would add two more trains in each direction on April 16 as a \\"one-year trial\\" for station ridership. The town hoped to get the then 67-person a day average to 100 people using the station by April 1, 2010, when the trial was set to expire. The mayor of Little Falls, Michael DeFrancisci, urged people to use the station more. However, by December 2009, ridership had declined to 9 per day. On December 18, 2009, New Jersey Transit contacted Little Falls and said that the station would close in January 2010, three months before the year-long trial period to build ridership was set to end. The transit authority cited continued low ridership, as on average nine passengers a day boarded the train at Great Notch. On December 21, 2009, New Jersey Transit announced the closure stating that the \\"anemic\\" ridership had remained at Great Notch, with only an average of 9 boardings a day, compared to 203 at the local Little Falls station and 597 at the Montclair State University Station. The last train to depart Great Notch was the 6:51pm train from Hoboken Terminal on January 15 leaving Great Notch at 7:41pm, as weekend trains do not run on this portion of the Montclair-Boonton Line.

The film was co-produced by Davenport and Thomas H. Ince and distributed by Film Booking Offices of America. No print of this film is known to exist today, and it is considered a lost film. Davenport's husband Wallace Reid was addicted to morphine, which had been prescribed to him after an injury. The film portrayed the dangers of drug addiction and was shown across the country by Davenport herself, billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid, in an early example of what would later be called a roadshow engagement.  Plot  Ethel McFarland (Davenport) presents her attorney husband, Alan (Kirkwood), with the case of a dope addict named Jimmy Brown (Hackathorne). With the help of Alan's impassioned defense, Jimmy gets acquitted. Alan feels the pressures of his job and is introduced to a doctor at his club. When he becomes addicted, he is blackmailed by his peddlers to represent their friends in court. Jimmy, now off the smack and a taxi driver, hears of these goings-on. When he discovers that his passenger is the leader of the dope ring, he resolves to aid the war on narcotics by crashing the vehicle head-on into an oncoming train, killing them both. Alan gets treated for his addiction and begins to fight the pushers in court, all the while pushing for stronger laws against addictive substances. At the film's close, Davenport addresses the audience directly, imploring them to support her in her crusade to wipe out the menace of narcotics.  Cast   Censorship  Davenport on the film set On January 14, 1923, Will H. Hays was appointed as president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America. Wallace Reid died just four days later, on January 18. Although it took years for the so-called \\"Hays Code\\" to be finalized, the Code did set certain standards for movies from the very beginning, including a ban on any reference to drug use. Despite this, Davenport received a dispensation from Hays allowing her to produce Human Wreckage because of its anti-drug message. The film was banned by the British Board of Film Censors in 1924.

Born in Pryluky, a city in the Chernihiv Oblast (province) of present-day north-central Ukraine (at the time a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic), Oleg Koshevoy's family moved south to Rzhyshchiv and Poltava before settling in Krasnodon (at the eastern border of Ukraine) in 1940, where he attended secondary school. In July 1942, Krasnodon was occupied by the German Army. Under the leadership of the party underground, Koshevoy organized an anti-nazi Komsomol (Communist Youth) organization called the Young Guard (, translit. Molodaya gvardiya), becoming its commissar. In January 1943, the Germans exposed the organization. Oleg Koshevoy tried to cross the front line, but was soon apprehended. He was tortured and then executed on February 9, 1943. On September 13, 1943, Oleg Koshevoy was posthumously awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union, the Order of Lenin, and later, the Medal \\"Partisan of the Patriotic War\\" 1st class.

He was a member of the triumvirates that governed the colony for several short periods between 1524 and 1528, in the absence of Cort√©s. Origins and early career There is no documentary evidence indicating that Alonso was the illegitimate son of King Ferdinand II of Aragon. Legend has him as the bastard son of Fernando II el Catolico and a Luisa de Estrada, daughter of an ambassador. This is refuted by the 1585 limpieza de sangre of his great- grandson, Gobernador Jorge de Alvarado y Villafa√±e, which names Alonso de Estrada‚Äôs parents as Juan Fernandez Hidalgo, of Ciudad Real, and his first wife - whose name none of the witnesses could remember, only that his 2nd wife was surnamed Oliver. It did name his paternal grandparents as Diego Fernandez Hidalgo and Maria Gonzalez de Estrada. Alonso was well educated and a formidable military commander. He fought in the wars in Flanders, and afterwards, as an admiral, in the campaigns in M√°laga and Sicily. Returning to Madrid, he fought in the Castilian War of the Communities, opposing the rebels against Emperor Charles V. For this, Charles rewarded him with the position of corregidor of C√°ceres, and later named him treasurer of New Spain. In letters, Alonso de Estrada was sometimes referred to as \\"el magn√≠fico se√±or el thesorero Alonso de Estrada, gobernador de esta Nueva Espa√±a por sus majestades.ARCHIVO GENERAL DE INDIAS. Guatemala, Sign. GUATEMALA,118,N.4. Probable 1609. Acceso en l√≠nea en http://pares.mcu.es. Traducci√≥n hecha por: Valeriano Villajos Garc√≠a. Archivero Municipal de Ciudad Real (Espa√±a). His wife Marina de la Caballer√≠a would eventually join him in his efforts, in 1523. Royal treasurer of New Spain He arrived to the New Spain in 1523, appointed treasurer of the colony by the Council of the Indies, on the authority of Charles V. His mission was to participate in the government of Cort√©s and to protect the interests of the Crown. Marcos de Aguilar and Luis Ponce de Le√≥n (governor of New Spain) (colonial official) were also sent by the Crown to act as judges in the juicio de residencia of Cort√©s, but Ponce de Le√≥n died of indigestion contracted at his welcoming banquet. He was rumored to have been poisoned by Hernan Cort√©s. First period in government In 1524 Governor and Captain General Cort√©s left Mexico City for Honduras. He left the government in charge of Estrada, Rodrigo de Albornoz and Alonso de Zuazo. Zuazo (or Suazo) held the additional office of Justicia Mayor. The transfer of power occurred October 12, 1524. This triumvirate shared power with the ayuntamiento (city government). The ayuntamiento was composed of partisans of Cort√©s; Estrada and Albornoz were (or soon would be) his enemies. At one point Estrada issued orders to prevent the reentry of Cort√©s into Mexico City. The three men governed for about two and one-half months, until December 29, 1524. On that date, with the agreement of the ayuntamiento, two of them were replaced by Gonzalo de Salazar and Pedro Alm√≠ndez Chirino. Alonso de Zuazo remained. This was on Cort√©s's instructions, brought back from Coatzacoalcos by Salazar and Alm√≠ndez, in order to end disagreements between Albornoz and Estrada. The change was thought to have been brought about by the intrigues of Salazar. Second period in government Estrada returned to the government from February 17, 1525 to April 20, 1525. It now contained five members  Salazar, Alm√≠ndez, Estrada, Albornoz and Zuazo. On the latter date, Salazar and Alm√≠ndez proclaimed that no one was to recognize the authority of Estrada and Albornoz, on pain of 100 lashes and confiscation of property. This proclamation was signed by Zuazo, Cervantes, de la Torre, Sotomayor, Rodrigo de Paz (a member of the ayuntamiento), and the clerk P√©rez. Estrada and Albornoz left Mexico City for Medell√≠n, but before they had traveled eight leagues, Alm√≠ndez sent armed men after them and took them prisoner. Third period in government In early 1526 a messenger (Mart√≠n de Orantes or Dorantes) from Cort√©s arrived in Mexico City. His instructions were to replace Gonzalo de Salazar and Pedro Alm√≠ndez Chirino in the governing triumvirate with Francisco de las Casas and Pedro de Alvarado. In the absence or incapacity of Las Casas and Alvarado, Estrada and Albornoz were named as replacements. Orantes entered the city in secret and made contact with members of the opposition. At daybreak on January 28, 1526, Orantes and other opponents of Salazar and Alm√≠ndez left the convent where they were staying, marched along the streets shouting \\"Viva Cort√©s\\", arrested Salazar, and succeeded in getting the ayuntamiento to execute the orders of Cort√©s. Estrada and Albornoz rejoined the government, because Las Casas and Alvarado were absent. Alm√≠ndez was arrested later in Tlaxcala, and brought back to Mexico City. Estrada and Albornoz governed from January 29, 1526 to June 24, 1526, or just short of six months. Cort√©s returned and took up the government again (very briefly) on June 25, 1526. Fourth period in government Estrada governed a fourth time from March 2, 1527 to December 8, 1528, with Gonzalo de Sandoval and Luis de la Torre, for about 21 months. (Sandoval was part of the government only until August 22, 1527). On August 22, a royal decree was received in Mexico City, ratifying the transfer of powers granted by Luis Ponce de Le√≥n to Marcos de Aguilar, but Aguilar had died on March 1. Aguilar had named Estrada governor, and this decree solidified his position. Since Cort√©s was suspected of poisoning Ponce de Le√≥n and Aguilar, he was not in a position to challenge Estrada. Death and Succession Estrada died in Mexico City in the period 1533 to 1537. An act of the Mexico City government dated September 22, 1533 refers to him as alive, and a letter from the viceroy to the king dated December 10, 1537 mentions him as deceased.Alonso de Estrada: El ciudareale√±o que llego a ser Gobernador de Nueva Espa√±a pag. 103. Alonso died in 1530 or 1531. Alonso married Marina Guti√©rrez de la Caballer√≠a, a woman from a prominent Jewish converso family of royal treasurers from Aragon, Spain. Alongside, they procreated: * Fray Juan de Estrada, Benedictine monk and consultant of the Inquisition. * Luis Alfonso de Estrada, lord of Pic√≥n, alderman of Ciudad Real, administrator of the household of King Philip II, and noble mayor of the \\"Holy Brotherhood\\". * Luisa de Estrada, who married Captain Jorge de Alvarado, conquistador of Tenochtitl√°n, and brother of Pedro de Alvarado. * Marina de Estrada, who married Luis de Saavedra Guzm√°n, \\"encomendero\\" of Tilaltongo, a son of the Counts of Castellar, and descendant of the Dukes of Medina Sidonia. * Ana de Estrada, who married Juan Alonso de Sousa, treasurer of the New Spain after Alonso de Estrada, alderman of Mexico City, a son of Lope de Sousa de Portugal, governor of the Canary Islands, and In√©s de Cabrera y Aguayo. * Francisca de Estrada, who married Alonso de √Åvalos Saavedra, conquistador of Nueva Galicia, a son of Diego L√≥pez de Saavedra and Mar√≠a Verdugo. * Beatriz de Estrada, who married Francisco V√°zquez de Coronado, first governor and captain general of the Kingdom of Nueva Galicia.

An example would be an experienced student being a peer mentor to a new student, the peer mentee, in a particular subject, or in a new school. Peer mentors are also used for health and lifestyle changes. For example, clients, or patients, with support from peers, may have one-on-one sessions that meet regularly to help them recover or rehabilitate. Peer mentoring provides individuals who have suffered from a specific life experience the chance to learn from those who have recovered, or rehabilitated, following such an experience. Peer mentors provide education, recreation and support opportunities to individuals. The peer mentor may challenge the mentee with new ideas, and encourage the mentee to move beyond the things that are most comfortable. Most peer mentors are picked for their sensibility, confidence, social skills and reliability. Critics of peer mentoring insist that little is known of the nature of peer mentoring relationships and that there are few consistent studies indicating the outcomes of peer mentoring beyond good feelings among peers and the development of friendships. Peer mentoring led by senior students may discourage diversity and prevent critical analysis of the higher education system. Program design characteristics The frequency with which peer mentors and mentees meet varies according to the particular mentoring program. Some pairs may make contact once a month, while others may meet 3-4 times per month or more. It is usually advised that mentors and mentees meet more often in the beginning of the relationship in order to establish a good foundation. Mentors and mentees may maintain contact through email, telephone or in-person meetings. Peer mentoring organizations may also set up social events for those participating in the program. These events provide good opportunities for increased social interaction between mentors and mentees. The compatibility of mentor and mentee is a factor that should be taken into consideration when choosing pairs. Mentors and mentees may benefit from having similar backgrounds, interests and life experiences. Age, gender, ethnicity, language preferences, and education may be taken into consideration when pairing mentors with mentees.Steve Grbac, \\"How to implement a ‚ÄòPeer Support‚Äô program in a P-6 School,\\" Scotch College Junior School, Melbourne Australia, June 2008. The quality of the peer mentoring relationship is important for mentees to experience positive results. A mentor relationship is more successful when the mentor cares for the whole person and not just the academic or career side of a person. Successful mentors tend to be available, knowledgeable, educated in diversity issues, empathic, personable, encouraging, supportive, and passionate. Although this is not an exhaustive list of qualities, they have been shown to be important for successful mentoring relationships. It is important to keep qualities like this in mind when recruiting and training mentors. The objectives of a peer mentoring program should be well-defined and measurable. The effectiveness of the program should be monitored to ensure that the objectives are being met. One way to monitor the effectiveness of a program is to administer evaluations to the mentors and mentees.Murray, M. (1991). Beyond the myths and the magic of mentoring: How to facilitate an effective mentoring program. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. In education Peer mentoring in education was promoted during the 1960s by educator and theorist Paulo Freire: :\\"The fundamental task of the mentor is a liberatory task. It is not to encourage the mentor‚Äôs goals and aspirations and dreams to be reproduced in the mentees, the students, but to give rise to the possibility that the students become the owners of their own history. This is how I understand the need that teachers have to transcend their merely instructive task and to assume the ethical posture of a mentor who truly believes in the total autonomy, freedom, and development of those he or she mentors.\\"Paulo Freire, \\"Mentoring the mentor: a critical dialogue with Paulo Freire,\\" Counterpoints: Studies in the Postmodern Theory of Education, Vol 60, 1997, Peer mentors appear mainly in secondary schools where students moving up from primary schools may need assistance in settling into the new schedule and lifestyle of secondary school life. However peer mentoring can occur at the grade school level, the undergraduate level, and the graduate school level. The goals of the program may vary according to the level, the educational institution or the discipline.Helen Cowie, Patti Wallace, Peer Support in Action: From Bystanding to Standing By, Sage Publications Ltd; 1st edition February 2001; Peer mentors in secondary schools aid in the transition of younger students from primary school to secondary school. They may assist mentees with their school work and study skills, peer pressure (such as pressure to use drugs or have sex), issues with attendance and behavior, and typical family problems.Sandy Hazouri, Miriam Smith McLaughlin, Peer listening in the middle school: training activities for students. Educational Media Corp., 1991. Youth mentors are persons for children or adolescents to spend time with, often to compensate for absent family members or an inadequate home environment. Mentoring programs for youth can be especially useful for students who are suffering from a lack of social support, and who therefore may be susceptible to delinquency. Peer mentors for undergraduates may assist newly admitted students with time management, study skills, organizational skills, curriculum planning, administrative issues, test preparation, term paper preparation, goal setting, and grade monitoring. Additionally, such mentors may provide other forms of social support for the student, such as friendship, networking, and aiding the student's adjustment to college life.Parsloe, E.; Wray, M. J.

A peer mentor at the graduate school level may assist new students in selecting an advisor, negotiating the advisor/advisee relationship, preparation for major examinations, publishing articles, searching for jobs, and adjusting to the rigors of graduate school life.Grant-Vallone, Elisa J., Ensher, Ellen A., \\"Effects of Peer Mentoring on Types of Mentor Support, Program Satisfaction and Graduate Student Stress: A Dyadic Perspective.\\" Journal of College Student Development, v. 41 n. 6 pp. 637-42, Nov-Dec 2000.  In higher education  Peer mentoring in higher education has enjoyed a good name and is seen favorably by both educational administrators and students. During the last decade, peer mentoring has expanded and is found in most colleges and universities, frequently as a means to outreach, retain, and recruit minority students. Peer mentoring is used extensively in higher education for several reasons: * Benefits attributed to classical mentoring (when an older adult mentors a younger person) can translate to peer mentoring relationships, mainly when the peer mentor and the mentee have similar backgrounds. Some colleges and university campuses have encouraged peer mentorship programs to aid retention of under-represented populations, such as women in economics. * The lack of role models or volunteers forces administrators and student leaders to use students as peer mentors of other students‚Äîusually first year students, ethnic minorities, and women‚Äîin order to guide, support, and instruct junior students; * Because peer mentoring programs require a low budget for administration and/or development, they become a cheap alternative to support students perceived as likely to fail. Advantages in education Peer mentoring may help new students adapt to a new academic environment faster. The relationship between the mentor and mentee gives the mentee a sense of being connected to the larger community where they may otherwise feel lost.Stoltz AD. \\"The relationship between peer mentoring program participation and successful transition to high school.\\" (Dissertation). University of California, Davis, 2005. Mentors are chosen because they are academically successful and because they possess good communication, social and leadership skills. As a consequence, mentors serve as positive role models for the students, guiding them towards academic and social success. Mentors provide support, advice, encouragement, and even friendship to students. Peer mentoring may improve student retention rates.Twomey, J.L. (1991). \\"Academic performance and retention in a peer mentor program at a two-year campus of a four-year institution. Research report.\\" Alamagordo, NM: New Mexico State University.Lahman MP. \\"To What Extent Does a Peer Mentoring Program Aid in Student Retention?\\" Paper presented at the Annual Conference of the National Communication Association. Chicago, 1999:12. Mentors also stand to benefit from the mentor/mentee relationship. Mentors develop friendships through their participation in mentoring programs and usually derive satisfaction from helping a younger student, and possibly shaping his or her life in a positive way. Mentors may also be paid, and they may receive other benefits such as prioritized registration, course credit, and references. In higher education tutorial settings, the benefits of peer mentoring programs also extend to class tutors. Using grounded theory techniques, Outhred and Chester found that five themes underlie their experiences: role exploration, sharing responsibility, regulation of the peer-tutored groups, harnessing the peer tutors‚Äô role, and community.Outhred, T, & Chester, A. (2010). The Experience of Class Tutors in a Peer Tutoring Programme: A Novel Theoretical Framework, Australasian Journal of Peer Learning, 3(1), 12-23. Criticisms Peer mentoring programs usually target ethnic minorities, people with disabilities and women. This approach tends to be conceived out of the \\"deficiency model\\" where multi- ethnic students, women and students with disabilities are perceived as being in need of help and unlikely to succeed unless senior students or successful adults help them.Fields, C.D. (1996). \\"Black peer mentors, cooperative advocacy beneficial to morale.\\" Black Issues in Higher Education, pp. 13, 24. One of the main criticisms of peer mentoring is the lack of research to show how peer mentoring relationships work, how they develop, and what their outcomes are.Tyler, J.L. (1994). \\"The death of mentoring.\\" Hospitals & Health Networks, pp. 68, 19, 84. Also, the nature of being either a mentor or mentee and at the same time a peer can make the relationship a dual one where other identities also converge. Some peer mentoring programs promote assimilation among ethnic minority students because of the use of student role models who are perceived as successful in social and educational environments characterized by majority students. These role models then become the people that peer mentees strive to imitate or emulate. A more subtle criticism of peer mentoring refers to their lack of supervision and structure: most peer mentoring programs led by undergraduate students rarely have direct supervision of full-time university staff. Given the fact that students are led by other students who serve as peer mentors, critics say that university staff may free themselves from their responsibility to listen and help first year students classified as peer mentees, the group with the largest attrition rate in higher education. Without extensive training and supervision, senior students who serve as mentors may offer unreliable guidance to peer mentees. There is little research on what happens within peer mentoring relationships. Maryann Jacobi, in an extensive meta-analysis of mentoring research, concludes by asking, \\"Does mentoring help students succeed in college? If so, how? Both theoretical and empirical answers to these questions are lacking.‚Äù Stephanie Budge states: :\\"The concept of mentoring has become increasingly popular over the past few decades. Mentoring has been advertised as necessary in order for students and employees to flourish in their environment. However, the lack of research concerning peer mentoring programs in particular is surprising. While there is an abundance of articles on the topic of mentoring in the educational setting, authors must be held to more stringent research standards and more definitional consistency. In addition to higher quality research, the fundamental flaws within peer mentoring programs need to be corrected before these programs can reach their full potential on college campuses.\\" Peer mentoring in higher education usually focuses on social, academic, and cultural skills that can help students graduate from colleges and universities, and how the educational system works (e.g. how to apply for financial aid, how to register for classes, how to write papers, how to choose a major, etc.). The knowledge students receive usually comes from senior students who serve as peer mentors. Although peer mentoring programs are appealing to most people and seem easy to implement and develop, there is little research to suggest that peer mentoring gives the same results as classical mentoring. Versus classical mentoring Morton-Cooper and Palmer distinguish between classical mentoring (also known as primary mentoring) and contract or facilitated mentoring.Alison Morton-Cooper, Anne Palmer Mentoring, preceptorship and clinical supervision: a guide to professional roles in clinical practice. Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford, 2000; , pp. 44-45. Classical mentoring is characterized as an informal, often spontaneous enabling relationship between an older mentor and a younger mentee, based on a shared wish to work together, usually for a long period, without financial compensation for the mentor. Peer mentoring differs from classical mentoring in two aspects.Linda Holbeche, (1996) \\"Peer mentoring: the challenges and opportunities\\", Career Development International, Vol. 1 No. 7, pp. 24 - 27. First, in peer mentoring mentors and mentees are close in age, experience, educational level, and they may also overlap in their personal identities, which are usually the criteria for matching, but this may leave junior students vulnerable to peer pressure and unsupervised rivalry. Second, peer mentoring programs are semi-structured planned programs with specific guidelines and frequently with a set number of meetings and activities within a predetermined amount of time. Students who enroll in peer mentoring programs tend to be matched mostly according to major course of study, gender, language of preference, and ethnic background, and those students who share the largest number of similarities tend to become peers in the peer mentoring relationship. Little research is available to know what happens between peer mentors and peer mentees who have different characteristics.  Cross-age  The Handbook of Youth Mentoring provides the following definition of cross-age peer mentoring: :\\"Peer mentoring involves an interpersonal relationship between two youths of different ages that reflects a greater degree of hierarchical power imbalance than is typical of a friendship and in which the goal is for the older youth to promote one or more aspects of the younger youth's development. Peer mentoring refers to a sustained (long-term), usually formalized (i.e. program-based), developmental relationship. The relationship is \\"developmental\\" in that the older peer's goal is to help guide the younger mentee's development in domains such as interpersonal skills, self-esteem and conventional connectedness and attitudes (e.g. future motivation, hopefulness).\\" Cross-age mentoring can be distinguished from peer mentoring by the fact that the mentor is in a higher grade level and/or is older than the mentee. Whereas in peer mentoring students of the same age are paired together based on varying levels of achievement. Karcher (2007) also notes: :\\"Cross-age peer mentoring programs utilize structure, meet for more than ten meetings, do not focus primarily on deficit or problem reduction, and require an age span of at least two years.\\" Advantages of Cross Age Mentoring In general, cross-age mentoring programs can involve a tutoring or teaching component, personal mentorship and guidance, or both, and they incorporate many of the advantages of other forms of peer mentorship. Because student mentors are closer in age, knowledge, authority and cognitive development than adult mentors, mentees often feel freer to express ideas, ask questions, and take risks. These similarities also make it easier for mentors to understand personal and academic problems that the mentee may be experiencing, and present solutions in a more understandable and relevant way. Furthermore, unlike same-age peer mentoring, cross-age programs can prevent feelings of inferiority on the part of the mentee when they are mentored or tutored by a student of the same age or status. Thus, mentors who are slightly older than their mentees can take advantage of the higher status provided by their age difference while enjoying increased compatibility with their students. The specific benefits of cross-age mentoring/tutoring are numerous, and are briefly described here in three main categories: increased academic achievement, improved interpersonal skills, and personal development.Gaustad, Joan. Peer and Cross-Age Tutoring. ERIC Digest, Number 79. ERIC #:ED354608 Publication Date: 1993-03-00Kalkowski, Page. Peer and Cross-Age Tutoring. School Improvement Research Series. NWREL. March 1995. Cross-age mentorship, and tutoring programs in particular, support the academic achievement and learning process of both the mentor and the mentee. Mentees benefit from increased personalized attention in a one-on-one setting and can work at their own pace. Sessions are customized for the mentee's individual questions, needs, and learning styles, and mentees gain a greater mastery of the material and concepts, while developing creativity and critical thinking skills. The mentor may also gain a deeper understanding of the material or subject that they are teaching, as this relationship often encourages a deeper dedication to their own studies so that they may more effectively communicate what they‚Äôve learned. The mentor gains a deeper sense of responsibility, dedication, and pride in being able to help a peer, while both students take pride in mutual accomplishments and successes. Ultimately, cross-age mentorship programs may increase retention and graduation rates, especially among minority students. In addition to improved learning and transmission of information, the mentorship process allows both students to develop more effective interpersonal communication skills. Mentees learn how to effectively form and pose questions, seek advice, and practice active listening and concentration. Similarly, the mentors gain valuable practice in effective teaching strategies. This format fosters increased self-esteem, empathy and patience in both participants, potentially creating new friendships and breaking down social barriers for students struggling to adjust to a new academic setting. Often the mentor will serve as an important role-model, and can model academic skills and work habits as well as personal values (e.g. dedication to service, empathy, and internal motivation). This relationship can be pivotal for the success of new or underserved students in academia by providing an opportunity for peers to discuss academic issues, career choices, research ideas, and personal matters.Gensemer P. \\"Effectiveness of Cross-Age and Peer Mentoring Programs.\\" (Monograph) 2000. Monitoring and evaluation Cross-age mentoring programs require careful consideration of the goals, objectives and the available human, physical and financial resources in order to ultimately assess the progress made by the participants and the overall usefulness of the program. Frequent assessment is important as it gives valuable insight into how well the cross-age mentoring curriculum is organized and implemented, and provides positive reinforcement for both the mentor and mentee. Mentors should be pre-screened according to their academic proficiency and attitudes to ensure that they will be able to meet the needs of a mentee. Moreover, mentors will also benefit from ongoing training, supervision and psychological support by teachers, administrators, parents and other members of the community.  Examples in schools  Sudbury schools (PreK-12 democratic free schools) Because Sudbury schools are completely age-mixed from ages 4 thru 18, with no grades or age-segregated classrooms, it is common for students to engage in peer mentoring. The Coca-Cola Valued Youth Program One established cross-age mentoring program is the Coca-Cola Valued Youth Program (VYP), which originated in San Antonio, Texas through the Intercultural Development Research Association (IDRA). In an effort to decrease truancy, the need for disciplinary actions and drop-out rates of students, this program paired up ‚Äúat-risk‚Äù middle school students to tutor ‚Äúat-risk‚Äù elementary school students, both primarily of Hispanic origin with limited English proficiency.\\"Continuities ‚Äì Lessons for the Future of Education from the IDRA Coca-Cola Valued Youth Program,\\" Intercultural Development Research Association, San Antonio, Texas, 2009. In this case, the tutors who participated were not only rewarded by getting paid and receiving course credit, but also by receiving recognition for their service and by improving their own academic and tutoring skills through special tutoring classes. These VYP program benefits, in turn, resulted in a positive impact on school success and lowered the dropout rates of these tutors.Cardenas, Jose A., et al. \\"Valued Youth Program: Dropout Prevention Strategies for At-Risk Students. Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association, Chicago, Illinois, April 1991. 25 pages. The University of Massachusetts Peer Mentor Program The Peer Mentor program at UMass Amherst offers undergraduate students the chance to be live-in, part- time staff members for freshman residents within residential life. This is a paid position. The Peer Mentor's \\"job\\" is to assist freshman students with their transition from high school to college. UMass Peer Mentors offers academic support within the first year and are responsible for connecting the residents to campus resources throughout the academic year. Peer mentors follow a curriculum that includes but are not limited to: assisting in New Student Orientation (NSO), academic mentoring (which includes references to tutoring centers, deans, and undergraduate advising), connecting faculty with the students, and hosting various academic success workshops. In the workplace Peer mentoring can offer employees a valuable source of support and information in the workplace.Ragins BR, Kram KE. The handbook of mentoring at work: theory, research, and practice. Los Angeles: Sage Publications, 2007. Peer mentoring offers a low cost way to train new employees or to upgrade the skills of less experienced workers. Mentees may feel more comfortable learning from a peer than in a hierarchical setting. Mentors as well as mentees may also benefit from the bonds they form with colleagues. In 1978 Edgar Schein described multiple roles for successful mentors in the work setting. New employees who are paired with a mentor are twice as likely to remain in their job than those who do not receive mentorship. In health care Peer mentoring has been shown to increase resistance to stress-related anxiety and depression in patients, or clients, affected by chronic illness or mental health issues. Mental health peer mentors and peer support groups help clients change their lifestyle and adhere to a more productive healthy lifestyle by adjusting habits and helping them realize helpful ways of coping and taking on personal responsibility. Peer mentors can also help patients prepare for medical and surgical procedures and adhere to treatment regimes. Peer mentoring has been implemented in programs to support survivors of traumatic brain injury,Hibbard MR, Cantor J, Charatz H, Rosenthal R, Ashman T, Gundersen N, et al. \\"Peer support in the community: Initial findings of a mentoring program for individuals with traumatic brain injury and their families.\\" The Journal of head trauma rehabilitation, 2002;17(2):112. cancer patients,Rini C, Lawsin C, Austin J, DuHamel K, Markarian Y, Burkhalter J, et al. \\"Peer mentoring and survivors' stories for cancer patients: positive effects and some cautionary notes.\\" Journal of Clinical Oncology 2007;25(1):163. dialysis patients, diabeticsRiva Greenberg, \\"Peer Mentoring Powerful for Diabetes Behavior Change,\\" The Huffington Post, Jan 19, 2011. persons with spinal cord injuries,Spinal Cord Injury Peer Mentoring and to reduce HIV transmission and increase adherence to treatment in HIV-positive IV drug users.Purcell DW, Latka MH, Metsch LR, Latkin CA, G√≥mez CA, Mizuno Y, et al. \\"Results from a randomized controlled trial of a peer-mentoring intervention to reduce HIV transmission and increase access to care and adherence to HIV medications among HIV-seropositive injection drug users.\\" JAIDS: Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes 2007;46:S35. Peer mentoring is also used in training health care workers.Carol Kostovich, Karen Saban, Eileen Collins, \\"Becoming a Nurse Researcher: The Importance of Mentorship,\\" Nursing Science Quarterly, October 1, 2010 v. 23, pp. 281-286.Pollock J, Georgievski Z. \\"Peer mentoring in undergraduate clinical education of orthoptic students.\\" Paper presented at the HERDSA Annual International Conference.

A large number of fossil and subfossil bones, representing more than 100 individuals, have been found in locations in California, Oregon, southern Nevada, Arizona, and Florida, though most are from the Californian La Brea Tar Pits. All remains except one Early Pleistocene partial skeleton from the Leisey Shell Pit near Charlotte Harbor, Florida (which may represent a different species or a subspecies) date from the Late Pleistocene, with the youngest remains dating from the Pleistocene- Holocene boundary. Taxonomy T. merriami skeleton from the La Brea tar pits in flight pose Its generic name means \\"monster bird\\". * Teratornis merriami. This is by far the best-known species. Over a hundred specimens have been found, mostly from the La Brea Tar Pits. It stood about 75 cm (29.5 in) tall with estimated wingspan of perhaps 3.5 to 3.8 metres (11.5 to 12.5 ft), and weighed about 15 kg (33 lb); making it about a third bigger than extant condors. It became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene, some 10,000 years ago. * Teratornis woodburnensis.Campbell, Kenneth E. Jr. & Stenger, Allison T. (2002): A New Teratorn (Aves: Teratornithidae) from the Upper Pleistocene of Oregon, USA}. pp. 1‚Äì11. in Zhou, Z. and F. Zhang. Proceedings of the 5th Symposium of the Society of Avian Paleontology and Evolution Beijing, 1‚Äì4 June 2000. China Science Press, Beijing. The first species to be found north of the La Brea Tar Pits, this partial specimen was discovered at Legion Park, Woodburn, Oregon in 1999. It is known from a humerus, parts of the cranium, beak, sternum, and vertebrae which indicate an estimated wingspan of over 4 meters (14 ft). The find dates to the late Pleistocene, about 12,000 years ago, in a stratum containing the remains of megafauna such as mammoth, mastodon, and ground sloths, as well as evidence of early human occupancy at the site. Another form, \\"Teratornis\\" olsoni, was described from the Pleistocene of Cuba, but its affinities are not completely resolved; it might not be a teratorn, but has also been placed in its own genus, Oscaravis. There are also undescribed fossils from southwestern Ecuador, but apart from these forms, teratorns were restricted to North America. Description Reconstructed skull Teratornis merriami had a wingspan of around and a wing area of 17.5 square meters, standing an estimated tall. It was somewhat larger than the extant Andean condor and weighing about , was nearly double the weight of an average Californian condor. A closely related genus, Aiolornis, was about 40% larger and lived at an earlier time; it was formerly known as Teratornis incredibilis, but is distinct enough to be placed in its own genus. The finger bones are fused as in all modern birds; however, part of the index finger forms a shelf which aided in bearing the load of long and stout primaries, which enabled the bird to utilize strong upcurrents. The legs were similar to an Andean condor's, but stouter, and the feet could hold prey items for tearing off pieces, but could not exert a very forceful grip such as in birds of prey. Its wing loading was not much larger than a Californian condor's, and Merriam's teratorn should have been able to take off by simply jumping and beating its wings under most circumstances. Indeed, it seems to have been better adapted for that than for utilizing a short run into the wind from an elevated location as condors do, as its legs are proportionally smaller and its stride less than in condors. Paleobiology Life restoration of T. merriami T. merriami generally lived in a manner similar to condors, although its larger bill suggests that it was a more active predator. Prey up to the size of a small rabbit would probably have been swallowed more or less whole, while carrion would have been fed on in a manner similar to that of condors or vultures. The large number of finds in the La Brea Tar Pits were usually considered to be from teratorns which were attracted by Pleistocene megafauna that became stuck and died in the viscous asphalt while trying to drink from pools of water that gathered on the surface, with the teratorns subsequently falling victim to the sticky deposits too. Merriam's Teratorn probably played an important role in opening up the body cavities of carcasses for smaller birds like eagles and ravens which are also known to have frequented the locality, as mammalian predators, being unable to fly, could hardly reach most carcasses without getting mired in the asphalt themselves. However, there were also true vultures present in the area at that time, and unlike them, T. merriami was also well adapted to hunt for smaller animals which are also known to have utilized the pools. Analysis of the skull and bill shapes suggests that fish may have constituted a major part of its diet. Taking into account the strong legs, stout claws, and a gripping power not quite as developed as in eagles, it is rather likely that Merriam's Teratorn would have hunted for aquatic prey in the manner of an osprey, which also provides a neat explanation of how such large numbers of powerful, well-flying birds could have become stuck in the asphalt. Extinction The species probably became extinct as the climatic shifts at the end of the last ice age led to widespread ecological alterations and prey scarcity, exacerbated by human hunting and increasing influence on habitat; generally, most large land animals disappeared and the altered precipitation patterns seriously affected populations of aquatic vertebrates. Despite being a better hunter than the California condor, it still was inferior as a predator of small prey to hawks and eagles. The higher population density and more flexible diet of the condor probably ensured that it survived, while T. merriami did not. Recent isotopic studies suggest that the California condor survived the extinction of the megafauna because it also scavenged dead marine mammals off the Pacific Coast. The teratorn relied more heavily on the carrion of land mammals and therefore could not survive their extinction.

The use of swash characters dates back to at least the 16th century, as they can be seen in Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi's La Operina, which is dated 1522. As with italic type in general, they were inspired by the conventions of period handwriting. Arrighi's designs influenced designers in Italy and particularly in France. Typefaces with swashes Calvin. Swash capitals are used throughout and on many letters at the end of words too. This use would probably now be considered excessive. Most typefaces with swashes are serif fonts, among which (if present) they are often found solely in italics. Advanced digital fonts often supply two italic designs: one with swashes and a more restrained standard italic. Among old-style typefaces, some releases of Caslon, such as Adobe Caslon, and Garamond, including Adobe Garamond Pro and EB Garamond, have swash designs. Old-style typefaces which include swashes but do not follow a specific historical model include Minion by Robert Slimbach and Nexus by Martin Majoor. Among transitional typefaces, Baskerville's original design has swashes on J, N, Q and T. Some revivals remove these, while others may add more. Mrs. Eaves has a particularly large number. Didone fonts with swashes include Surveyor and ITC Bodoni. Helvetica Flair, a redesign of the sans-serif font Helvetica with swashes Sans-serif fonts with swashes are rarer, but some were released in the Art Deco and Streamline Moderne style of the 1930s, including for Tempo and Semplicit√†. Classiq by Yamaoka Yasuhiro, based on Garamond, contains swash italic designs, as do Goudy's Sans Serif Light Italic and Mr Eaves by Zuzana Licko, a sans-serif derivative of her serif family Mrs Eaves. Helvetica Flair, a redesign of Helvetica with swashes by Phil Martin, is considered a hallmark of 1970s design, and has never been issued digitally. It is considered to be a highly conflicted design, as Helvetica is seen as a spare and rational typeface and swashes are ostentatious: font designer Mark Simonson described it as \\"almost sacrilegious\\". Martin would later recall being accused of \\"typographic incest\\" by one German writer for creating it. Flamboyant swashes in the Zapfino typeface As swashes are based on period handwriting, script typefaces with swashes are common, and include Zapf Chancery and Zapfino, both by Hermann Zapf. Some historical revivals add optional swashes to designs that did not originally have them to produce a more varied design. For example, Adobe Garamond Pro's swash design is based not on the printing of Claude Garamond himself but on designs by his younger contemporary Robert Granjon. The original Caslon italic had swashes only on the letters JQTY; others have been added since by revivals of his designs.

Early life  Borgmann was born on October 22, 1927 in Berlin, Germany, to Hans and Lisa Borgmann. Fearing that the Nazi government would discover Lisa's Jewish ancestry, the family fled to the United States in 1936, and settled in Chicago. Borgmann graduated from the University of Chicago in 1946 and found work as an actuary. In 1964 he quit his job to focus on his writing. In 1971 he started his own research and manuscript writing business, INTELLEX, which employed up to 15 writers at a time to ghost-write and edit short stories, academic books, and TV and movie scripts. Borgmann eventually relocated the company and his family to Dayton, Washington.  Writing career  Borgmann first attracted media attention for his skill with words in 1958, when over the course of eight weeks he defeated 22 challengers in a row on WGN-TV's It's In The Name, winning nearly $3,800. Around this time he also started contributing word puzzles and trivia to \\"Line o' Type or Two\\", a column in the Chicago Tribune. Much of this material was mined from back issues of The Enigma, the official journal of the National Puzzlers' League which he had joined in 1956. By 1964 he had established himself as \\"the country's leading authority on word play\\", a designation he continued to hold up until the time of his death. His first book, Language on Vacation: An Olio of Orthographical Oddities, was published by Scribner's in 1965, and received critical acclaim from major magazines and literary journals, including Time and Scientific American. Today it is best remembered for popularizing the word logology to refer to the field of recreational linguistics; Borgmann himself is often referred to now as the \\"Father of Logology\\". The publicity generated by Language on Vacation led to Borgmann being contracted by industrial design firm Loewy & Snaith to invent brand names for their clients. For this work he is widely cited as the creator of \\"Exxon\\", which Standard Oil adopted as its new name after paying Borgmann a $10,000 fee. At $2000 per letter, commentators joked that this made Borgmann the most highly paid writer in history. Language on Vacation also attracted the attention of puzzle author Martin Gardner, who in 1967 recommended Borgmann as the editor for Greenwood Periodicals's new magazine Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics. Borgmann edited the magazine for its inaugural year, but resigned after Greenwood refused to meet his salary demands. When Greenwood appointed fellow logologist Howard W. Bergerson to succeed him as editor-in-chief, Borgmann refused to ever speak to him again. A follow-up to Language on Vacation, entitled Beyond Language: Adventures in Word and Thought, was published in 1967; it was less successful but still attracted favorable reviews. Borgmann also edited and annotated a book on crossword puzzles, 1970's Curious Crosswords. Throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s he was a regular writer for The Chicago Tribune, Games, and Puzzle Lovers Newspaper, and continued to contribute articles to Word Ways. (Much of this writing was published under pseudonyms, including El Uqsor, Jezebel Q. XIXX, Ramona J. Quincunx, and Prof. Merlin X. Houdini.) He also sponsored \\"Jackpot Jubilee\\", a series of word contests.  Later life and death  In the late 1970s Borgmann founded a new religious movement, the Divine Immortality Church, and took out ads in New Times, The Atlantic, Mother Jones and other magazines, offering ordainment certificates and divinity degrees. He also advertised the church in Hustler, encouraging the publisher to omit the first T in \\"Immortality\\". As many as a hundred people joined the movement. Borgmann had a reputation for being reclusive to the point of eccentricity, a characteristic which intensified in his later years. None of his colleagues from publishing‚Äînot even his literary agent Joseph Madachy, nor Martin Gardner, who got Borgmann the editorship of Word Ways‚Äîever met him personally. His successors at Word Ways, Howard W. Bergerson and A. Ross Eckler, Jr., never met him either. Borgmann's home life was even more secluded; most external and internal windows were boarded up or covered with heavy drapes, and mirrors were not permitted in the house. Borgmann rarely left his cluttered upstairs room, sometimes working secretively for weeks without seeing his family. Though he was diagnosed with a heart condition, he refused to take his prescribed medication, and eventually succumbed to a heart attack on December 7, 1985. He was survived by his wife of 23 years, Iris Sterling, and their two sons, Mark and Keith. After his death, Eckler and Borgmann's son Keith went through his papers, finding material for a number of articles which were published posthumously in Word Ways. Nineteen folders containing Borgmann's correspondence with Martin Gardner, dating from 1956 to the 1980s, were collected and are preserved in the Special Collections and University Archives of the Stanford University Libraries.

The breed originated in 1928, when the owner of the island, Martin Coles Harman, introduced 34 New Forest pony mares, eight foals, and a Welsh Mountain B strawberry roan stallion. Diana Keast, his daughter, explained why he chose to cross these breeds: ‚ÄúHe wanted ponies with a bit of style and height. Dartmoor and Exmoor ponies were nearer and more convenient - after all he had to charter a special train to bring the ponies from Lyndhurst - but they wouldn‚Äôt have had the height he wanted.‚Äù The Welsh stallion died only a year after arriving on the island, having sired just one foal - a colt called Pepper. Luckily this first ‚ÄúLundy pony‚Äù grew into an upstanding stud stallion, creamy dun with a black mane and tail. By the Thirties there were so many ponies roaming the island that about 50 were rounded up and sold on the mainland. During the war there was no way of shipping ponies from the island and the herd reached nearly 100. There was constant warring among the entire stallions so that in 1944 a number had to be put down. The pony herd was moved from the island in 1980 and taken to Cornwall, where it continued to breed. Some were also taken to New Devon. In 1984, the Lundy Pony Breed Society formed to oversee the breed. The Society later decided to return some of the mares and foals to the island of Lundy. Due to the harsh environment of the island, with its poor vegetation and severe weather, the ponies grew to be incredibly tough and hardy. They typically are dun, roan, palomino, bay, or liver chestnut in color, and rarely exceed 13.2 hh. The ponies have a wide, deep chest, sloping shoulder, and hard, sound legs. Their necks are usually well-set and muscular and their backs strong and compact. Lundy Ponies are useful as mounts for children, as they are both attractive animals and good natured.

The strip regularly appeared in Penthouse magazine from 1973 to 1980. In the 1960s, Ron Embleton, already a veteran comic book artist, had worked extensively for TV Century 21 comic, illustrating stories based on the television programmes Stingray, Thunderbirds, and Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, amongst others. For Wicked Wanda Embleton painted the panels in watercolour.http://www.bookpalace.com/acatalog/Home_Ron_Embleton_Art_146.html Original watercolour artwork from the strip at The Book Palace Frederic Mullally began his career in the 1940s as a journalist, and by the time of Wicked Wanda he had already become a successful novelist. Prior to the illustrated strip format, the character of Wanda appeared as an illustrated story in Penthouse, from September 1969 through to October 1979. This was written by Mullally and illustrated by Brian Forbes. Background The strip's characters appeared naked or partially clothed, and great care was given to the female form, especially the breasts and buttocks. In line with the relatively explicit direction that Penthouse had taken following the \\"pubic Wars\\", the strip featured pubic hair. Although male characters occasionally appeared nude, their genitals were not often shown and they were shown mostly in the background, with none of the sometimes gratuitous appearances that often was true with regard to female characters. A running gag in several of the early comic strips features a pastiche of Little Annie Fanny (published by Playboy, Penthouse's main competitor) in which the character is found out to have fake breasts or buttocks which deflate when popped. Main characters Wanda Von Kreesus A beautiful black-haired heiress to a multi-million-dollar fortune, 19-year-old Wanda Von Kreesus was a ‚Äúman-hating‚Äù lesbian. She lived in an old castle called the Schloss (the German word for 'castle') on Lake Zurich, Switzerland, and ran a bank which, among other things, contained secrets that could bring down world governments. Her adventurous travels took her to such exotic locales as: * Arabia * Tibet * Europe * India * New York City * Hollywood * Las Vegas * Disneyland She also travelled through time, courtesy of a time machine, visiting France during the French Revolution, England during the signing of the Magna Carta, and Germany during World War II, before briefly visiting the future and returning to the present. While in later parts of the series, she would have a handful of male 'toys' whom she would use and abuse until they died of exhaustion, her sexual preference was almost exclusively for women. Candyfloss Candyfloss is a 16-year-old blonde nymphet was originally sent as a \\"present\\" to Wanda's father, but his daughter claimed her as her own. Wanda encouraged her father to chase Candyfloss, resulting in his death from exhaustion and enabling Wanda to claim her inheritance. Wanda often called her ‚ÄúPusscake‚Äù, while Candyfloss‚Äô nickname for Wanda was ‚ÄúBoo‚Äôful‚Äù. The term \\"candyfloss\\" is the common UK name for \\"cotton candy\\". Candyfloss was apparently pansexual, having sex with anyone who came her way, much to Wanda's annoyance. Automobiles Wanda drove a Supo Delecto Peniso Flagrante sports car, which, as its name implies, resembled a phallus and was capable of attaining a top speed of 160 miles per hour. The license plate bore the alphanumeric designation ‚ÄúFKU2‚Äù. Sometimes, her auxiliary automobile, a Rolls Royce station wagon, followed. Puss International Force Throughout her adventures, Wanda was also assisted by her elite army of ‚Äúbutch-dikes‚Äù, the Puss International Force, or PIF, the commander of which was General German Grrrr. (A play on renowned feminist Germaine Greer; \\"German\\" was her forename, not her nationality; the precise number of R's in her last name tended to vary from one month to the next.) Homer Sapiens and J. Hoover Grud A ‚Äúresident egghead‚Äù, Homer Sapiens, and the Neanderthal-like ‚Äúchief jailer‚Äù and master torturer J. Hoover Grud (a reference to FBI founder J. Edgar Hoover) provided the brains and muscle needed to support Wanda's many adventures. Although Grud looked like a caveman, he was a sensitive intellectual who expressed his aspirations only to himself, never to others. Sapiens was a mad scientist and former Nazi collaborator. Wanda called him \\"Eggbonce\\" (\\"bonce\\" is slang for head). Sapiens was a sadism masochist who enjoyed nothing better but a beating from Wanda, either as a reward or as a punishment, so either way he won. Walter Von Kreesus The preserved cadaver of her degenerate father was seated upon a throne under a green glass dome. On occasion, Wanda sought advice from him after establishing a psychic or spiritual link with the corpse. During his lifetime, Candyfloss, Wanda's paramour, was one of the many women whom Walter kept as a mistress. The source of his great fortune that Wanda later inherited was Grigori Rasputin, who in 1916 was attempting to lodge for safe keeping a large fortune in jewels in the Swiss bank that von Kreesus was working for. However, Rasputin's untimely death left the large hoard in von Kreesus' possession. Needless to say, the bank heard no more from Herr von Kreesus. He then proceeded to increase his fortune still further through various underhand dealings, with amongst others, Lenin, to whom von Kreesus lent a train fare when the communist leader was on his way to a 3 April 1917 important meeting. Cultural and political allusions The strip was replete with inside jokes and references to popular and classical culture. For example, a member of Wanda's entourage lay naked reading William S. Burroughs‚Äô novel Naked Lunch while a second fornicated with a swan, recalling William Butler Yeats' poem, \\"Leda and the Swan\\", based on the myth about Zeus‚Äôs fornication, in the guise of a swan, with Leda. Many politicians and artists were caricatured in the strip, including a drenched and apparently besotted Ted Kennedy, who appeared in several panels throughout the strip‚Äôs ten-year run, wearing an ever-present ‚Äò76 presidential campaign ribbon. His appearance was a not-so-subtle reference to the incident in which he drove off the Chappaquiddick Bridge, killing his companion, Mary Jo Kopechne. Rival politicians, including Richard Nixon, were treated with the same degree of satirical ridicule. For example, Nixon was frequently shown as a sometimes machine-gun-toting gangster. Caricatures The strips frequently included caricatures of famous people, especially politicians. For example, in the debut strip, Wanda and Candyfloss visit Madame Tussaud‚Äôs ‚Äúwaxworks,‚Äù passing the likenesses of Richard Nixon, Spiro Agnew, Charles de Gaulle, Lyndon Johnson, Fidel Castro, Henry Kissinger, and Mao Zedong, among others, as they make their way toward the museum's ‚ÄúChamber of Horrors.‚Äù These satirical portraits were usually given names similar to the names of the people they parodied: Marlon Blondo (aka Burpo), Henry Kissarun, Norman Mailman, and Herod Huge, for example. Senator Ted Kennedy was invariably depicted standing in a pool of liquid, a reference to the Chappaquiddick incident. Other famous figures that Wanda and Candyfloss encountered include Bob Hope, John Wayne, W. C. Fields, Mae West, Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart, Marilyn Monroe, Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, Muhammad Ali, Salvador Dal√≠, Benjamin Spock, Charles Bronson, Lee Marvin, Liberace, Howard Hughes, Harold Wilson, Edward Heath, Ronald Reagan, Kirk Douglas, Idi Amin, William Conrad, Golda Meir, Rasputin and Billie Jean King. When an image was particularly effective at parodying a politician, an entertainment personality, or another public figure, it was repeated. For example, Marlon Brando (sometimes called ‚ÄúBurpo‚Äù), who was known for his love of good eating and his enormous weight gain, was often shown attired in a pin-striped suit, nonchalantly eating twirled spaghetti from a fork. In addition, the names of caricatures were chosen with satirical effect in mind. Hence, Jane Fonda was christened ‚ÄúJane Fondle‚Äù and Brando was named ‚ÄúMarlon Blando‚Äù during his Last Tango in Paris days but Marlon Burpo after his figure ballooned due to the rich foods he was fond of consuming in his later career. The strip also included satirical sketches of well-known cartoon and comic strip characters, such as Mad Magazine‚Äôs Alfred E. Neuman; Playboy‚Äôs Little Annie Fanny; Walt Disney‚Äôs Seven Dwarfs, Mickey Mouse, and Donald Duck; Walt Kelly‚Äôs Pogo, George Herriman‚Äôs Krazy Kat, and Bud Fisher's Mutt and Jeff. First series ; Episode One On their first adventure, Wanda and Candyfloss decided to buy Madame Tussaud's ‚Äúwaxworks‚Äù as a way to acquire figures of famous men and women with whom to equip the ‚Äúmuseum of living apes‚Äù that she planned to establish at the mansion that she has inherited from her father, Walter, the late King Gnome of Zurich. However, they were disappointed with the exhibits, which were not sufficiently carnal for Wanda's tastes; as she told Candyfloss, ‚ÄúTussaud‚Äôs was a real drag.‚Äù Instead of ‚Äúwax dummies‚Äù, Wanda preferred deep- frozen ‚Äúauthentic, living flesh‚Äù for her ‚Äúliving tableaux of top personalities‚Äù. Before leaving on their quest, Wanda inspected her PIF. She meted out punishment by flogging the backside of one of her troops, who afterward walked away with a smile on her face as a fellow soldier observed, ‚ÄúThis is your second time around!‚Äù ; Episode Two On their second adventure, Wanda and Candyfloss undertook a quest to acquire ‚Äútableaux vivants‚Äù for Wanda's Museum of Misfits. Arriving at a villa in St. Trollop on the French Riviera, they visit the ‚Äúpornophobe‚Äù adult film critic, Lord Cyril Bluestocking and Brigitte Bidet (Brigitte Bardot), their intended first acquisitions. After Candyfloss knocks Bluestocking unconscious, she helps Wanda transport him and Brigitte to Wanda's museum, where Homer Sapiens has the couple displayed with Bidet mounted (literally) as the museum's first exhibit. ; Episode Three In the third installment of the first adventure, Wanda and Candyfloss decided to add some politicians to their Museum of Misfits, and they went after California Governor Ronald Reagan. ; Other episodes of the first series Other chapters in their first adventure followed this same plot, with Wanda and Candyfloss obtaining such additional famous men and women for their Museum of Misfits as chess champion Bernie Fishfinger (Bobby Fischer), Martin Bormann, Willy Grabham (Billy Graham) and Jane Fondle (Jane Fonda). Oh, Wicked Wanda! (the book) Penthouse published a compilation of the strip in a book in 1975. Replacement strip Oh, Wicked Wanda! was replaced by Sweet Chastity, another comic illustrated by Ron Embleton and scripted by Penthouse's publisher, Bob Guccione. Wanda as nose art  In the tradition of George Petty and Alberto Vargas, whose pin-ups were the basis for much World War II aircraft Nose art, Wicked Wanda graced the nose of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, 44-83863, when it originally went on display at the United States Air Force Air Force Armament Museum, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida in 1975. The aircraft was later repainted in another scheme.

Reviewers consider it a premium program. Although originally written exclusively for the Mac OS (and then iOS), Accordance was then released (October 1, 2013) in a Windows-native version, although it was available prior to this by using the Basilisk II emulator. Since 2018 there has also been an Accordance app for Android. The program is used for both private and academic study. The translators of the Holman Christian Standard Bible, completed in 2004, used it for word studies, comparisons and instant searches. Commenting on the use of Accordance, the HCSB's editor Ed Blum said, \\"This project used far more computerization than anyone else has ever been able to do.\\" OakTree Software OakTree Software, Inc. is based in Altamonte Springs, Florida, USA. The company has focused on areas of special interest, particularly the study of Biblical texts. OakTree Software claims three specific goals: *Offering innovative and powerful features which cannot be found anywhere else *Providing the most intuitive, elegant, and easy-to-use interface possible *Providing a wide range of useful resources like texts, dictionaries, & commentaries, for Bible study.OakTree Software on company site Program history Roy Brown, OakTree Software's president and application developer, created one of the first Bible programs available for the Macintosh, known as ThePerfectWord, in 1988. ThePerfectWord was later bought by another company and renamed MacBible. By the early 1990s there were a number of good general Bible study programs for the Mac. However, Brown saw the need for a new program which would make it easy to engage in more sophisticated kinds of Bible study, enabling scholars and pastors to do in-depth analysis of the original Greek and Hebrew texts of the Bible. Accordance 1.0 was released in February 1994, and welcomed for its power and ease of use.Accordance: History on company site A version of Accordance 5.0 rewritten to run natively under Mac OS X was released at the start of 2002.Accordance Bible software now Mac OS X native, January 14, 2002, Macworld. The company has continued to add and improve features, such as the native Quartz rendering system. Version 8 was released in May 2008 and introduced a universal binary for Intel-based Macs. Version 9 was released in September 2010, version 10 in 2012, version 11 in 2014 and version 12 in 2016.

The Canadiens were substitute NHL representatives, as the final series to decide the NHL champion was not played. The Cougars were the last non-NHL team to win the Cup as the WCHL (renamed the Western Hockey League for the 1925‚Äì26 season) folded after 1926, leaving the Stanley Cup to become the NHL's de facto championship trophy. The Cougars would also be the last team based west of Chicago to win the Cup until the Edmonton Oilers won the trophy in 1984. These were also the last Stanley Cup Finals games to be played in Western Canada until the Vancouver Canucks qualified for the 1982 Finals. Games one, three and four were held in Victoria. Game two, held in Vancouver, was the last neutral site game in Stanley Cup Finals history that did not involve the New York Rangers until the 2020 Stanley Cup Finals. Path to the Finals Prior to the season, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) folded and two of its teams, the Cougars and the Vancouver Maroons joined the WCHL. Victoria finished the 1924‚Äì25 WCHL regular season in third place, but eventually upset the Calgary Tigers in the two-game total goals WCHL championship series by a combined score of 3‚Äì1. Meanwhile, the Canadiens also finished the NHL regular season in third place. In the NHL playoffs, Montreal went on to beat the second place Toronto St. Patricks, 5‚Äì2, in a two-game total goals series. The winner of that series was to go on and play the first place Hamilton Tigers. However, the Tigers were suspended after Hamilton players staged a strike in an attempt to receive more compensation because the league extended the regular season from 24 to 30 games. As a result, the Canadiens were declared the 1924‚Äì25 NHL champions. * - NHL Championship Roster Montreal Canadiens - Louis Athanase David^ (Executive Director), Jeosph Cattarinich^ (Vice President/Owner), Louis Letourneau^ (Director/Owner), Leo Dandurand^ (President-Owner/Manager-Coach), Napolean ‚ÄúNap‚Äù Dorval^ (Secretary), Cecil Hart^, Amerdee Monte Judge, Harry Elliot^, Fernand Rinfeet^, Edouard St. Pere^ (Directors), #1 Georges Vezina(G-R)^, Alphonse \\"Frenchy\\" LaCroix (G-Spare), #2 Spraque Cleghorn(D-L)^, #10 Fern ‚ÄúCurly‚Äù Headley(D-L), #9 Sylvio Mantha(D-R)^, #5 Billy Boucher(RW-R)^, #7 Howie Morenz(C-L)^, #4 Aurel Joliat(LW-L)^, #6 Ogilvie ‚ÄúOdie‚Äù Cleghron(C-R)^, #3 Wilfred \\"Billy\\" Coutu^ (D-L-Captain), #9 Johnny Matz(C-R), #12 Rene \\"Bobby\\" Joliat(D-L), #11 Ronald ‚ÄúRene‚Äù Lafleur(LW-L), #11 David Ritchie(D-R), Ed Dufour^ (Trainer). * ^-Name was engraved on the Stanley Cup with Montreal in 1924.

Founded in 1905, Peoples was subsequently purchased by Lane Drug in 1975, Imasco in 1984, and finally by CVS in 1990, which continued to run the stores under the Peoples banner until 1994, at which time the stores were converted to CVS, marking the end of the use of the Peoples Drug name. History Peoples Drug was founded by Malcolm Gibbs in 1905 at 824 7th Street, NW. By 1930, it had 110 stores operating under the Peoples Drugs, Days Drug, and Shearer Drug names. There were variations of the name, with Peoples Service Drug, and Gibbs Peoples Drug being most common. In 1970, Peoples had 252 stores operating in the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, New York, and New Jersey. That year there were 5,500 employees, with sales of $220 million and profits of $1.87 million. Alternate Link via ProQuest. By 1975, Peoples had grown to 500 stores. Later in the year, the chain was purchased by Lane Drug of Toledo, Ohio., The new company retained the Peoples name, and included Lane Drug, Schuman Drug, Dynamic Drug, Health Mart, Reed Drug, and Lee Drug. Lane president Sheldon \\"Bud\\" Fantle took over the presidency of the chain and went to work on improving merchandising and customer service at Peoples. In 1980, Peoples acquired the Indianapolis-based Haag Drug which had 80 drug stores in Indiana, Iowa, Illinois and Kentucky. In 1985, two \\"Bud's Deep Discount Drug Stores\\" were opened in the Toledo area, with others in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The name \\"Bud's\\" was derived from the nickname of Sheldon \\"Bud\\" Fantle. In January, 1987, Mr. Fantle left Peoples and later took control of troubled Dart Drug in Washington DC, renaming those stores Fantle's. Peoples Drug store in Washington, D.C., ca. 1920 Acquisition by Imasco In 1984, Peoples was acquired for $320 million by the Canadian conglomerate Imasco, the Canadian arm of British American Tobacco, and owner of Shoppers Drug Mart and Pharmaprix in Canada. At that time, Peoples and its divisions had close to 800 stores and became one of the country's leading drug chains. After being acquired by Imasco, Peoples quickly acquired Rea & Derick in 1985 and also took control of the Florida Shoppers Drug Mart locations. Sales and conversions Over the years, the Haag stores were converted to Peoples in 1983, and Dynamic and Schuman were converted to Lane. A program was implemented to convert all stores to the Peoples Drug name. Many Lane and Rea & Derick stores were converted, all stores began selling Peoples Brand product, and began using bags with the Peoples Drug logo. Not long after being acquired by Imasco in 1984, Peoples decided to sell some of their stores and concentrate on the Mid Atlantic states. First to go were the 35 Florida Shoppers Drug Mart stores that was sold to Eckerd in 1986. Next was the Atlanta based Reed/Lee Drug to Big B Drugs in 1989 for $50 million. The 85 store division gave Big B their entrance into the Atlanta market, a goal they had been working on for years. The next sale was the 114-store Lane drug to Rite Aid, effective April 11, 1989. The last phase was the Indiana division of Peoples being sold in 1989 to a group of former Rite Aid officials that was headed by Roger Grass, changing the former Peoples stores to Reliable Drugs. Reliable survived only four years before it filed for bankruptcy and its stores were sold off to Osco Drug and Rite Aid in 1993. Sale to CVS Final Peoples Drug logo (late 1980s-mid 1990s) before conversion to CVS name After the dust settled from the sales, Imasco decided to unload the Peoples Drug chain, as Peoples was not performing at the level Imasco had hoped. In late 1990, CVS Corporation purchased Peoples for $330 Million. CVS kept the Peoples Drug name in place, remodeled most stores to the CVS format and improved the stores' sales. The Peoples name was considered to be too strong a name to change it to CVS/pharmacy immediately. The name did ultimately change in May 1994, just a few months before the Peoples Drug name would have celebrated its 90th anniversary.

Organization The forward surgical team is organized into four functional areas: * HEADQUARTERS ‚Äì Communications, Command and Control, and administrative functions. * ATLS (advanced trauma life support) ‚Äì Triages and prepares multiple casualties for surgery or transport and has a total of up to 4 beds or treatment areas with litter stands. * OR (operating room) ‚Äì Sets up and begins surgery within one hour, can be at full functioning capacity within two hours of establishing an area of operations. The OR has two separate OR tables that can be used at the same time allowing treatment for a greater number of casualties in a given time. * PACU/RECOVERY(post-anesthesia care unit) ‚Äì Number of beds available varies based on mission up to 8 beds, deployment and available resources, for post-surgical care; Most beds will be for patients awaiting medical evacuation. FSTs forward deployed typically do not hold patients beyond recovery but are sometimes forced to due to long medevac times or weather. Equipment The Forward Surgical Team equipment and supplies are packed into four HMMWVs each with an M1101 trailer and two LMTV 2.5 ton cargo trucks each with a M1082 cargo trailer. Units are normally augmented with two trailers mounting a power generator and an air conditioning system. These trailers are referred to as ECU [Environmental Control Units] or GET [Generator/ECU Trailers]. When so equipped, two of the M1101 trailers are removed. The airborne Forward Surgical Team can be slingloaded onto cargo helicopters and moved by the headquarters unit.

The idea of the character comes from the books of Palmer Cox. Dunno, recognized by his bright blue hat, canary-yellow trousers, orange shirt, and green tie, is the title character of Nosov's world-famous trilogy, The Adventures of Dunno and his Friends (1954), Dunno in Sun City (1958), and Dunno on the Moon (1966). There have been several movie adaptations of the books. Names His names were translated differently in various languages:             Plot summaries The three fairy tale novels follow the adventures of the little fictional childlike people living in \\"Flower City\\". They are described to be sized like \\"medium cucumbers\\", a quality that has earned them the name \\"shorties\\" or \\"mites\\". All fruits and vegetables growing in Flower City are, however, their regular size, so the Shorties invent sophisticated methods of growing and harvesting them. In Nosov's universe, each shorty occupies his/her own niche in the community and is named accordingly. The Adventures of Dunno and his Friends The illustration for The Adventures of Dunno and his Friends. Postal card, Russia, 2008. In Flower Town, Dunno gets into heaps of trouble. First, he becomes convinced that the sun is falling and manages to scare half the town before Doono, Dunno's brainy antithesis (his name is derived from the Russian \\"\\", I know) clears everything up. Then he proceeds to try music, art, and poetry, but his unorthodox endeavors only irritate his friends, and he is forced to quit. Next, ignoring the warnings of Swifty, Dunno crashes Bendum and Twistum's car into the Cucumber River and ends up in the hospital. He then gets into a fight with his best friend Gunky for not ending his friendships with the girl-shorties Pee-Wee and Tinkle. Doono proposes to build a hot air balloon and go on an adventure. He and his friends begin extracting rubber, weaving the basket, and making emergency parachutes out of dandelions. A large rubber balloon is then inflated, fastened to the basket, and filled with hot air. The parachutes and other supplies are loaded, and sixteen seats are accommodated for. Everyone helps with preparations except for Dunno, who is too busy bossing everyone around and providing useless advice. The day of the departure comes, and Doono, Dunno, and fourteen other Mites come on board. Shot takes with him his dog, Dot. By this time, half the town still does not believe the balloon will be able to fly, but the balloon successfully rises off the ground, and all the shorties of Flower Town cheer. Gunky waves to Dunno from the ground but Dunno shuns him. The balloon eventually crashes near the Greenville, inhabited only by girl-Mites (boy-Mites had left for the Kite Town where they can carry out freely their boyish activities), who took balloonists to the hospital to care for them. As Doono (who escaped from the balloon by parachute before the crash) is absent, Dunno describes himself to girl-Mites as balloon inventor and boy-Mites' leader. When he visits the hospital, he talks boy-Mites into supporting his version of facts, in exchange promising to help them out of hospital as soon as possible. With the time, Dunno's lies are discovered and he's mocked by boy-Mites, but consoled by girl-Mites. Dunno in Sun City After receiving a magic wand from a wizard, Dunno, Pee-Wee, and Pachkulya Pyostrenkiy wish for a car and go on a road trip to Sun City. During their journey, they see many technological marvels like futuristic cars, bizarre architecture, televisions that can communicate with you, computerized chess players, etc. They also run into some trouble in the city, particularly when Dunno uses his magic wand to turn a Shorty into a donkey, and then turns two donkeys and a hinny into Shorties.  Dunno on the Moon  Doono discovers that his moon rock (that he obtained from his previous travel to the Moon) creates a no gravity zone when interacting with a magnetic field. He uses this knowledge to build a rocket ship that will go to the moon much more easily because of being virtually weightless. However, Dunno and Roly-Poly are not allowed to go; Dunno, because of his undisciplined behavior, and Roly-Poly, because of his inability to cope with non-gravity effects and excessive food consumption. The night before the rocket launch, Dunno and Roly-Poly sneak into the ship and accidentally launch the rocket. When they arrive on the moon, Dunno and Roly-Poly become separated and Dunno falls through a cave and discovers a whole separate society of mites living inside the moon. However, unlike on Earth, these mites do not have \\"giant food\\" (that is, their fruit and vegetables are sized in proportion to the mites, rather than to normal humans like on Earth). The moon society is a corrupt capitalistic state: the millionaires control all the factories and squander their money away on unnecessary luxuries, the police are violent, corrupt, and stupid, everyday citizens struggle to survive and live in rat infested barracks. Dunno gets thrown into jail for not having money to pay for his meal at a restaurant and is mistaken for a wanted criminal by the stupid police officers. In jail he meets Miga - a fast-talking schemer, and Kozlik - a poor, gentle worker. Upon getting released from jail, Miga introduces Kozlik and Dunno to Zhulio - another con man, and the four decide to start a company selling stocks to raise money to get \\"giant seeds\\" from Dunno's rocket ship and plant them on the moon. The stocks sell well and soon the four friends have much money. However, some of the local millionaire businessmen are worried that giant food will mean that poor workers can get richer and the millionaires may lose money. Their leader, Spruts, convinces Miga and Zhulio to steal the money and run leaving Dunno and Kozlik jobless and penniless. Meanwhile, Roly-Poly finds the same cave and also goes inside the moon. However, he quickly discovers salt and opens his own business making and selling it (salt was unknown for moon inhabitants). He gets rich but then goes bankrupt when the price of salt becomes too low because of a dumping scheme. Then Roly-Poly becomes an average worker. Dunno and Kozlik work odd jobs but are still starving and living in poverty in a rat infested basement. Kozlik gets bit by a rat and becomes sick. Just then, Dunno gets a job as a dog nanny for a rich woman, Mrs Minoga (\\"lamprey\\"), and makes enough money for a doctor for Kozlik who slowly recovers, but Mrs. Minoga finds out that Dunno took her dogs to the rat infested basement and fires him. Dunno and Kozlik then end up living on the street. Since Kozlik has lost his hat and Dunno lost his shoes they are breaking the law and get sent to Fool's Island which has a toxic atmosphere that turns all the people there into sheep which are then sheared for their wool. Later Dunno's friends come to Moon with giant seeds, which results in elimination of poverty and establishment of a communism-like economical system and saves Dunno and Kozlik from Fool's Island. Characters Flower Town Dwellers Russian stamp with the image of Dunno (1992) Named for its abundance of flowers, all streets are named after flowers as well. The Flower City is located by the Cucumber River, on the shore of which many cucumbers grow. Here boy-shorties and girl-shorties live together, but often have trouble getting along. *Dunno (–ù–µ–∑–Ω–∞–π–∫–∞, from Russian \\"–Ω–µ –∑–Ω–∞—é\\", \\"I don't know\\") - the title character of the trilogy and the most infamous personality in Flower City.

Nosov describes this as an effort to teach \\"honesty, bravery, camaraderie, willpower, and persistence\\" and discourage \\"jealousy, cowardice, mendacity, arrogance, and effrontery.\\" Strong political undertones are also present. In addition to general egalitarianism and feminism, communist tendencies dominate the works. The first book takes the reader into a typical Soviet-like town, the second into a communist utopia, and the third into a capitalistic satire. Nosov's captivating and humorous literary style has made his ideologies accessible to children and adults alike. At the same time, the Canadian anthropologist and critique of civilization and education Layla AbdelRahim emphasizes the anti-disciplinary and anti-totalitarian aspect of the Dunno trilogy. Behind Dunno's apparent ignorance lies the exploring spirit that prefers learning through its own experience rather than acquiring institutionalized knowledge - in this regard Nosov points out that in everyday tasks Dunno succeeds perfectly. Dunno's encounters with Dr Pillman and Doono - who knows everything - reveal the oppressive nature of medical and scientific authority.

The park's site was donated by Queen Liliuokalani, and lies southeast of downtown Hilo, on the Waiakea Peninsula in Hilo Bay. Much of the park now consists of Edo-style Japanese gardens, built 1917-1919, and said to be the largest such gardens outside Japan. The gardens contain Waihonu Pond as well as bridges, ponds, pagodas, statues, torii, and a Japanese teahouse. Included in the park is the small island called Moku ola, (also known as Coconut Island), connected to the park by a footbridge. It is a good place for a picnic, and some limited swimming. The name Moku ola literally means \\"island of life\\" in the Hawaiian language, since it was the site of an ancient temple dedicated to healing. There is a stone tower on the east side of the island which is the remnant of the old footbridge which was destroyed by a tsunami. From Coconut Island one has a great view of Hilo Bayfront, Downtown Hilo, and the rest of Hilo Bay. To the east, you can see the massive breakwater protecting Hilo Bay. It is located at coordinates . It is maintained by the County of Hawaii and non-profit Friends of Liliuokalani Gardens. The park is a popular location for public events, exercise, and dog-walking.

The bill passed the House of Representatives 60-48 and in the Senate 24-11. Abraham Lincoln was reluctant to sign the act; he felt that, in light of the Confederacy's recent battlefield victories, the bill would have no practical effect and might be seen as a desperate move. He was also worried that it could be struck down as unconstitutional, which would set a precedent that might derail future attempts at emancipation. Only personal lobbying by several powerful Senators persuaded Lincoln to sign the legislation, which he did on August 6, 1861.Donald, David Herbert. Lincoln. (1995) p. 314 Due to the fact that the bill was based on military emancipation, no judicial proceedings were required and therefore Lincoln gave Attorney General Edward Bates no instructions on enforcing the bill. Within a year of its passage, tens of thousands of slaves had been freed by the First Confiscation Act.Oakes, James. Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861-1865 (2013) p. 138-143. With respect to slaves, the act authorized court proceedings to strip their owners of any claim to them but did not clarify whether the slaves were free.McPherson, James. Battle Cry of Freedom. (1988) p. 356 As a result of this ambiguity, these slaves came under Union lines as property in the care of the U.S. government. In response to this situation, General David Hunter, the Union Army military commander of Georgia, South Carolina, and Florida, issued General Order No. 11 on May 9, 1862 freeing all slaves in areas under his command. Upon hearing of Hunter's action one week later, Lincoln immediately countermanded the order, thus returning the slaves to their former status as property in the care of the federal government. Before the act was passed, Benjamin Franklin Butler had been the first Union general to declare slaves as contraband. Some other Northern commanders followed this precedent, while officers from the border states were more likely to return escaped slaves to their masters. The Confiscation Act was an attempt to set a consistent policy throughout the army. Text of the act An Act to confiscate Property used for Insurrectionary Purposes. It has been enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That if, during the present or any future insurrection against the Government of the United States, after the President of the United States shall have declared, by proclamation, that the laws of the United States are opposed, and the execution thereof obstructed, by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the power vested in the marshals by law, any person or persons, his, her, or their agent, attorney, or employ√©e, shall purchase or acquire, sell or give, any property of whatsoever kind or description, with intent to use or employ the same, or suffer the same to be used or employed, in aiding, abetting, or promoting such insurrection or resistance to the laws, or any person or persons engaged therein; or if any person or persons, being the owner or owners of any such property, shall knowingly use or employ, or consent to the use or employment of the same as aforesaid, all such property is hereby declared to be lawful subject of prize and capture wherever found; and it shall be the duty of the President of the United States to cause the same to be seized, confiscated, and condemned. SEC. 2. And be it further enacted, That such prizes and capture shall be condemned in the district or circuit court of the United States having jurisdiction of the amount, or in admiralty in any district in which the same may be seized, or into which they may be taken and proceedings first instituted. SEC. 3. And be it further enacted, That the Attorney-General, or any district attorney of the United States in which said property may at the time be, may institute the proceedings of condemnation, and in such case they shall be wholly for the benefit of the United States; or any person may file an information with such attorney, in which case the proceedings shall be for the use of such informer and the United States in equal parts. SEC. 4. And be it further enacted, That whenever hereafter, during the present insurrection against the Government of the United States, any person claimed to be held to labor or service under the law of any State, shall be required or permitted by the person to whom such labor or service is claimed to be due, or by the lawful agent of such person, to take up arms against the United States, or shall be required or permitted by the person to whom such labor or service is claimed to be due, or his lawful agent, to work or to be employed in or upon any fort, navy yard, dock, armory, ship, entrenchment, or in any military or naval service whatsoever, against the Government and lawful authority of the United States, then, and in every such case, the person to whom such labor or service is claimed to be due shall forfeit his claim to such labor, any law of the State or of the United States to the contrary notwithstanding. And whenever thereafter the person claiming such labor or service shall seek to enforce his claim, it shall be a full and sufficient answer to such claim that the person whose service or labor is claimed had been employed in hostile service against the Government of the United States, contrary to the provisions of this act.

Career Ordained in 1722, he began his association with the county of Essex with a curacy at Great Waltham near Chelmsford in 1722.G. H. Martin, ‚ÄòMorant, Philip (1700‚Äì1770)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, May 2006 He was the Chaplain of the English Episcopal Church in Amsterdam from 1732 to 1734. In 1737 he became both the Rector of St Mary-at-the-Walls, Colchester as well as Rector of Aldham in Essex. During his time in Colchester, Morant wrote The History and Antiquities of Colchester, published in 1748; and his county history, The History and Antiquities of the County of Essex, published in two volumes between 1763 and 1768. He also conducted a number of excavations of Roman sites in and around the town. He married Anne Stebbing in 1739 and they had a daughter, Anna Maria. In 1755, Philip Morant was elected to the Fellowship of the Society of Antiquaries of London. After the death of his wife, he moved to his son-in-law's house in Battersea and was employed in the House of Lords, although he retained the living of both his parishes. He died in 1770 and is buried at Aldham, where his silhouette appears on the village sign. There is a contemporary memorial and a window of 1855 in his memory in the new church at Aldham (the memorial was moved in 1854), and there is a wooden plaque at St Mary-at-the-Walls dated 1966. The Morant Club was formed in Colchester in 1909 to investigate local archeology, but was dissolved in 1925.http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22006 In 1965, The Norman Way Secondary School in Prettygate, Colchester was renamed Philip Morant School and College in his honour.

Navagio Beach (Greek: ŒùŒ±œÖŒ¨Œ≥ŒπŒø, ), or Shipwreck Beach, is an exposed cove, sometimes referred to as \\"Smugglers Cove\\", on the coast of Zakynthos, in the Ionian Islands of Greece. Navagio Beach was originally known as Agios Georgios. On 2 October 1980, the coaster MV Panagiotis, ran aground in the waters around Zakynthos Island on Navagio Beach during stormy weather and bad visibility. Some rumours claim the ship was smuggling contraband; however official sources did not confirm this, and the captain was not convicted for such offences. In fact, after the captain alerted the authorities, 29 locals were convicted of looting the cargo and valuable equipment from the wrecked ship. The ship was abandoned and still rests buried in the limestone gravel of the beach that now bears the nickname Shipwreck. The location was prominently featured in the hit Korean drama Descendants of the Sun, leading to a surge of interest among Chinese and Korean tourists. The beach was briefly closed in 2018, and swimming and boat anchoring were forbidden, after a cliff collapse above the beach dropped a large amount of rock. The beach reopened and anchoring is permitted, but with restrictions out of concerns over future landslides.

It is the administrative headquarters for the Agar Malwa District which was formed in 2013 from a part of Shajapur District. The town is situated along the ujjain‚ÄîKota SH-27 highway. History Agar was the capital of the Parmar Kingdom during the 10th century along with Avantika (Ujjain), then it was the most popular visiting place of Mughal kingdom when Mandu was its capital. The Mughals liked to spend summer vacations there because the temperature during summer nights was very low compared to other areas in the region. During the Sindhia state a number of palaces were built which today are used for city court and for other government offices. Demographics India census, In the 2001 census, Agar had a population of 31,202, where males constituted 51.8% of the population and females 48.2%. In the 2011 census the population had grown to 50,000. Males now constituted 52% of the population and females 48%. Tourism Agar is a tourist attraction, famous for the temple of Jai Baba Baijnath, which was built by the wife of a British Lt. Colonel after a battle in Afghanistan in 1879 where his life was miraculously saved, allegedly, by Lord Shiva's intervention. The city has two lakes, Moti Sagar (bada talab) and Ratna Sagar (ratodia talab), which account for the large amount of water in the city. There is also a dam on the Kali Sindh River, the Parsukheri dam; two other dams are Pipliya Kumar dam and Tillar dam.

History Formation In 1859, the Crown Lands Department in the Province of Canada advertised a block of land for sale, comprising the townships of Dysart, Dudley, Harcourt, Gilford, Harburn, Bruton, Havelock, Eyre, Clyde, and Longford. The purpose was to promote rapid settlement of the newly created townships in the district through private enterprise. The company, whose first chairman was Thomas Chandler Haliburton, was formed in April 1861 under the British Joint Stock Companies Act 1856,1865 Act, Preamble and acquired the above lands later that year, through the intermediary of an association formed by Richard Bethell, Samuel Gurney and George Lyall. Among its investors (who were approached by John Beverley Robinson to participate in the venture) were Sir Francis Bond Head, Henry Kingscote and Hugh Edmondstone Montgomerie. Special legislation was passed by the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada in 1865 to facilitate the company's operations in the Province. Lengthy negotiations were carried on between the company, and the Department of Crown Lands concerning the selection of townships and the terms of sale. The department agreed to pay for the survey of the outlines of the townships, but the company had to pay for the survey within the townships and their subdivision into lots. Of the ten townships purchased by the company, Longford was located in the County of Victoria, while the others were then a part of Peterborough County. These, along with other townships of Peterborough County, Victoria County and Nipissing District, were incorporated as the Municipality of Haliburton in 1874, which later became the Provisional County of Haliburton. Although the company wanted to appoint Edward Madan Miles as the surveyor for these townships, the Crown Lands Department preferred Brookes Wright Gossage, who, with other surveyors under his direction, began work in the townships of Dysart and Longford. At first, Gossage was in partnership with John Stoughton Dennis and later with Vernon Bayley Wadsworth. As many as sixty or seventy men were employed on the project at one time, and large sums of money were required for wages and provisions. When the survey was completed it showed in the ten townships of which was deducted as being swamp, leaving to be paid for at 50 cents per acre. Miles was later appointed to re-examine the surveys, and determined that the acreage fit for settlement was far below that estimated by Gossage, but the latter's figures were accepted by the department. However, later settlers' experience proved the accuracy of Miles' report. Challenges From the outset the company had difficulty in selling the lands. The distance of the townships from the settled parts of the province, the absence of good roads, the rough nature of the country, the Civil War in the United States, the Fenian raids on the border, the Long Depression of 18731879, and rival attractions of Western Canada, all combined to discourage sales. From 1863 to 1870, a large number of emigrants came to settle in the region. By 1871, the company had sold to settlers and a number of town lots to various purchasers. Most of the company's profits were realized from the sale of timber. In 1872, the company built a road between the villages of Kennaway and Haliburton, and contributed to the cost of the connection of a telegraph line to Haliburton. In 1877, the company aided the construction of the Victoria Railway from Kinmount to Haliburton with the hopes of increasing settlement in the townships. By 1883, the Province of Ontario had begun to open up neighbouring townships in Haliburton and Muskoka with offers of free land grants, and the company found settlers were even more reluctant to purchase Company lands. The company was unable to cope with this competition. As a result, it was decided to offer for sale its complete holdings and undertakings in Canada. On April 11, 1883, the company appointed W.H. Lockhart Gordon and James Moore Irwin to be its commissioners of affairs in the area. Decline and dissolution The company was involved in disputes with the Municipality of Dysart relating to valuations of its real and personal property, which led to a settlement in 1885 that was subsequently ratified by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1887. The company initiated winding-up proceedings in 1888, and was reincorporated by letters patent in Ontario as the Canadian Land and Immigration Company of Haliburton Limited in 1889. From 1890 to 1897 little activity took place. Sales of land and timber cutting rights had practically ceased. In 1895, Irwin declared bankruptcy and the bank (most likely the Canadian Bank of Commerce) took possession of his rights and interests in Haliburton, which included his shares in the new Company. In 1922, the company sold Bruton Township to the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario for $225,000, and proceeds from the sale allowed the company to buy back from the bank the timber cutting rights previously licensed to Irwin. In 1933, the company sold Clyde Township back to the Province for $25,000. During the Great Depression, lumbering activities ceased once again, and financial difficulties resulted in liens being placed against the company's lands in Dysart. However, as more roads were constructed, the region began to develop as a tourist and vacation area, and land sales began to increase. At the outbreak of World War II, lumbering activities intensified, and carried on into the post-war years. By the end of 1946, all of the land originally purchased by the company had been sold. The company wound up its affairs, surrendered its charter, and ceased to exist.

Retrieved June 11, 2020 Plot Ryan Dunne is a local baseball player who dreams of playing in the Major Leagues. He helps his dad with his landscaping business and takes care of Veteran's Field, where his team, the Chatham A's play. Ryan, in his dedication to making the pros, has sworn off girls and drinking to avoid distractions. This changes when he sees Tenley Parrish, as he and his father are mowing the Parrish family's lawn. The next day, the A's have their first game of the season where rival Van Leemer shines pitching a shut-out, while Ryan is told to walk the stands for donations. That evening Ryan and Tenley have their first kiss. The next night Ryan is pitching in his first game of the season. The game goes well for the A's until the last inning when Ryan gives up a grand slam, allowing the other team to win the game. Ryan returns home to find his dad drunk and upset about the loss. Later, Ryan visits Tenley where he confides about his rocky relationship with his father and concerns about failing as a baseball player. Ryan is distracted by Tenley and feels a lot of pressure from scouts, family, the Parrish family, and friends. He is told that he's getting the start for an upcoming big game. The next night, Ryan starts out well, but comes apart later on. The loss causes him to be demoted to the bullpen in a relief position. Despite the bad outing, Hugh Alexander, a scout for the Philadelphia Phillies in attendance, shows interest in Ryan's talent. Eric Van Leemer and Dale Robin are kicked off the team not only for their bad behavior, but also for accidentally burning down a press box, and since Ryan has the freshest arm and the most rest, he is designated to start the final game. Tenley tells Ryan that she's leaving for San Francisco for a job opportunity the following night, which is the night of the final game. She tells him to let himself be great, before tearfully hugging him goodbye. Inspired by Tenley's words of encouragement, Ryan pitches one of the best performances ever seen in the Cape League, dominating the game with a no-hitter, with his friends, dad and brother, and several major league scouts, including Alexander, in attendance. Late in the game, he notices that Tenley has stopped by on her way to the airport to watch him. He proceeds to strike out the current batter, marking his eleventh strike-out of the game, and looks back to see that Tenley is gone. Ryan rushes to the airport where he catches Tenley before she boards her plane. They both profess their love for each other and she agrees to forego her job in San Francisco and stay. Ryan's dad and brother soon arrive with the scout Alexander, to tell him that his team won the game with a combined no-hitter. Alexander offers Ryan a contract with the Phillies that will start him out at their minor league affiliate, which he happily accepts. In a mid-credits scene, everyone is gathered to watch Ryan in his Major League debut as a relief pitcher for the Phillies. He delivers his first pitch to Ken Griffey Jr., who launches it into the stands for a home run. Phillies players Mike Lieberthal, Doug Glanville, and Pat Burrell, along with outfielder Ken Griffey, Jr., make appearances at the end of the film. Other notable cameos in the movie include Kevin Youkilis, Curt Gowdy, Hank Aaron and Carlton Fisk.

Reception Lawrence Van Gelder of The New York Times wrote that it was \\"figuratively and literally a minor league movie.\\" He opened his critique by stating, \\"Take the romantic impulse behind F. Scott Fitzgerald's story Winter Dreams. Add some New England small-town social stratification from John P. Marquand's novel Point of No Return. Add a pinch of lusty Apple Annies from Bull Durham and some townie-preppy animosity from Good Will Hunting. Then bury the whole thing under a mound of standard-issue parent-child conflicts and enough self-help clich√©s to drive Polonius to the aquavit barrel at Elsinore. Sprinkle with half-baked characters and a predictably odds-defying outcome, and the result is Summer Catch.\\" Joe Leydon of Variety was more forgiving with his analysis, but explained, \\"With its haphazard mix of boisterously crude comedy, romantic entanglements, class- conscious clashes and intensely competitive hardball, pic plays like it was inspired by a late-night channel surf through Major League, Bull Durham, One Crazy Summer and some late-‚Äô50s wrong-side-of-the-tracks meller.\\" He praised George Fenton‚Äôs score and the film's humor, singling out Matthew Lillard, Brittany Murphy and Beverly D'Angelo.

The Chatham A's baseball field that was used in the film was actually built from a field that had been abandoned for about 20 years. Within about eight weeks the field was complete with batting cages and a press box ready to film. Since the filming of the movie, the field has once again been abandoned and is simply an overgrown field. The majority of the people cast for the roles of the teammates were actual minor-league baseball players. Only seven of the 35 people cast for the roles of the teammates were actors. The baseball players had to attend a four- week training camp during which they learned how to ignore the cameras on the field and to feel and act more as a team. All of the actors had to practice every day.

Marius Casadesus (October 24, 1892 ‚Äì October 13, 1981) was a French violinist and composer. He was the brother of Henri Casadesus, uncle of the famed pianist Robert Casadesus, and grand-uncle to Jean Casadesus. Marius Casadesus achieved perhaps his greatest fame (or notoriety) through his association with the Ad√©la√Øde Concerto attributed to Mozart. This concerto was published in 1933 in a piano transcription under Mozart's name, with Casadesus as \\"editor.\\" Many music scholars believed in its authenticity, and Yehudi Menuhin made a recording of the concerto. It was even given a place in the K√∂chel-Verzeichnis (the standard catalog of Mozart's works), albeit as \\"K. Anh. 294a.\\" (\\"Anh.\\" denotes \\"Anhang\\" or \\"appendix\\" to the catalog.) However, Mozart collector Alfred Einstein's doubts about this piece were confirmed when Casadesus later admitted his authorship in court in 1977 during a copyright dispute. Casadesus' brother Henri was also a noted author of musical hoaxes, such as \\"Handel's Viola concerto in b-minor\\" and \\"J.C.

The school opened as Edward L. Constance Junior-Senior High School in 1951, with 1,500 students in 7th, 8th and 9th grades. Another grade was added each year for the next three years. The class of 1955 was the first graduating class. Early in 1955 the name of the school was changed to North Miami Senior High School.Pioneer Handbook 1958-1959. North Miami Senior High School Student Council. In the fall of 1955 the 7th, 8th and 9th grades were moved to the new North Miami Junior High School. History After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, North Miami High enrolled 88 survivors, the largest number of any MDCPS school. North Miami is a center of middle class Haitian Americans and most of the survivors who came to the Miami area were middle class. Michael Winerip of The New York Times interviewed 10 survivors at North Miami. They all indicated that the academic work at North Miami was less rigorous than the work at their private Haitian schools. After the earthquake, eight of the interviewed students reached Miami by flying on commercial airline services out of airports in the Dominican Republic. All of the students had visas to reside in the U.S., and many had previously spent summer vacations in Miami.Winerip, Michael. \\"New Influx of Haitians, but Not Who Was Expected\\" (Archive).

International Baccalaureate Since January 1990, North Miami has offered the International Baccalaureate program. This international non-profit educational foundation was founded in 1968 in Geneva, Switzerland. The organization administers programs for elementary, middle, and high schools, providing an international curriculum intended to be acceptable to universities around the world. North Miami Senior High hosts a magnet program that offers a rigorous diploma curriculum approved by the International Baccalaureate Organization, based in Geneva. The IB Magnet Program consists of approximately 250 students divided between pre-IB in grades 9 and 10, and IB in grades 11 and 12. Students are selected based upon academic achievement, previous advanced coursework and promise. The North Miami IB program is culturally and ethnically diverse due to the fact that students are transported throughout Miami-Dade County. IB diploma candidates are assessed at international standards in six areas with three exams taken at a higher level and three exams taken at a standard level. IB diploma candidates must also complete a 150-hour creativity, action and service requirement, write a 4,000-word independently researched Extended Essay, and complete a Theory of Knowledge class. North Miami Senior High also has an International Affairs program, which focuses on languages and international studies. This rigorous course of study offers the IB certificate in the chosen fields of study, while offering a variety of IB and AP courses to meet students' needs. Controversy On Wednesday, June 9, 2015, the Miami-Dade County Public Schools removed Alberto Iber from his position as principal of North Miami High for making a comment online supporting the actions of McKinney, Texas police officer David Eric Casebolt during a 2015 Texas pool party incident. Iber participated in an online, racially charged national debate over police treatment of African-Americans, by defending a white Texas a police officer who was recorded on video restraining an unarmed fifteen-year-old girl on the ground, and who later drew his handgun during the incident. The school district cited a violation of its core values as reason for Iber's reassignment. Band North Miami's Auxiliary was awarded a Superior rating.

It is a decommissioned Magnox power station located on the Dengie peninsula at the mouth of the River Blackwater, Essex. As of 2016, China General Nuclear Power Group and China National Nuclear Corporation are considering Bradwell for the site of a new nuclear power station. History The two Magnox reactor buildings in 2010 from the entrance road Construction of the power station, which was undertaken by a consortium involving Clarke Chapman, Head Wrightson, C. A. Parsons & Co., A. Reyrolle & Co., Strachan & Henshaw and Whessoe and known as the Nuclear Power Plant Company (NPPC),The UK Magnox and AGR Power Station Projects. began in December 1957, and electricity generation started in 1962. It had two Magnox reactors with a design output of 300 MW of net electrical output, although this was reduced to 242 MW net electrical in total as a result of the discovery of breakaway oxidation of mild-steel components inside the reactor vessel. Its peak output, achieved in the early 1960s, was nearly 10% above the design value. On a typical day it could supply enough electricity to meet the needs of three towns the size of Chelmsford, Colchester and Southend put together. It is the closest power station to Southend. The reactors were supplied by The Nuclear Power Group (TNPG), and the 9 turbines and 12 gas circulators by C. A. Parsons & Co.Nuclear Power Plants in the UK ‚Äì England . (6 of 52 MW main turbines supplying power to the grid, 3 of 22.5 MW auxiliaries turbines, one for each reactor for driving the gas circulators, with one standby auxiliary turbine).

Its location was deliberately chosen, as the land had minimal agricultural value, offered easy access, was geologically sound and had an unlimited source of cooling water from the North Sea. Nuclear fuel for Bradwell was delivered and removed via the nearest railhead, a loading facility adjacent to Southminster railway station on the Crouch Valley line. This included a dedicated siding and a gantry crane. In 1969, a new Honeywell 316 was installed as the primary reactor temperature-monitoring computer; this was in continuous use until summer 2000, when the internal 160k disk failed. Two PDP-11/70s, which had previously been secondary monitors, were moved to primary.  Decommissioning  In 1999, it was announced that the station would cease operation in 2002 ‚Äì the first UK station to be closed on a planned basis. On 28 March 2002 Lord Braybrooke, Lord Lieutenant of Essex, unveiled a plaque to mark the cessation of electricity generation and the beginning of the decommissioning stage. All spent nuclear fuel was removed from the site by 2005, the turbine hall was demolished in 2011, and by 2016 underground waste storage vaults had been emptied and decontaminated. Defuelling was completed in 2005,a joyous occasion on the front lawn was held with bottles of champagne given to everyone on site that day to mark the occasion. Demolition of all buildings bar from the ponds and two reactor buildings was completed in 2019. Demolition of the reactor buildings and final site clearance is planned for 2083 to 2093 Future plans Aerial view of the power station in 2007 In 2007 Bradwell became one of the sites being considered by British Energy for redevelopment in a new round of nuclear reactors. On 18 October 2010, the British government announced that Bradwell was one of the eight sites it considered suitable for future nuclear power stations. In 2014 The Sunday Times reported that the China General Nuclear Power Group and China National Nuclear Corporation were preparing preliminary designs for a 3 GW nuclear power station at Bradwell to submit to the Office for Nuclear Regulation. On 21 September 2015, Energy Secretary Amber Rudd announced that \\"China was expected to lead the construction of a Beijing-designed nuclear station at the (Bradwell) Essex site\\". EDF's chief executive Jean-Bernard L√©vy stated that the reactor design under consideration is the Hualong One. On 21 October 2015, it was reported that Britain and China have reached Strategic Investment Agreements for three nuclear power plants, including one at Bradwell.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34587650 On 19 January 2017, the UK Office for Nuclear Regulation started their Generic Design Assessment process for the Hualong One design, expected to be completed in 2021, in advance of possible deployment at Bradwell. The target commercial operation date is about 2030.

The rods were stolen for their scrap value by Harold Arthur Sneath, a worker at the plant. The theft was discovered by the local police when a van driven by Dennis Patrick Hadley, who was transporting the rods to their final destination, was stopped due to its defective steering. The rods were recovered and, in the subsequent court case, Sneath and Hadley were bound over for five years, each fined ¬£100, and were required to contribute to the costs of the court case. Neither was said to have understood the consequences of the theft. On 22 January 2011, a fire broke out during the decommissioning work as titanium condenser tubes were being cut up. No radiation was released from this fire. In literature The construction of the original power station is the subject of the Michael Morpurgo story Homecoming.London: Walker Books.

All DVDs currently released for those seasons are by The Pok√©mon Company International and distributed by Viz Media. One Piece aired reruns from Toonami, with the first 58 episodes having been aired on 4Kids TV prior to their Toonami premieres. It did not return to the site. 11 DVD volumes of the edited version were available from Viz Media, and it isn't available for legal streaming anymore in favor of Funimation's uncut dub that they started DVD releases for in 2008. The uncut version is currently streaming subbed on Crunchyroll and dubbed on FunimationNOW. Zatch Bell! originally aired on Toonami for 77 episodes, and is in the midst of a DVD release by Viz Media, however, it seemingly vanished from television after episode 77. Later, the show was added to Toonami Jetstream, and more recently, premiere English language episodes are being shown. It is currently being distributed by New Video. IGPX has already finished airing on Cartoon Network, with most of its run being on Toonami. It had uncut DVD volumes and edited DVD seasons by Bandai Entertainment from 2006 to 2007. In 2016, Discotek Media released the show on both edited and uncut forms on one DVD set, and is currently in print. There has been no word on the fate of MegaMan NT Warrior (which had aired on Kids' WB! for most of its run), but it is presumably being skipped in favor of Star Force. Rumors are being spread that episodes of the Rockman EXE. Stream series will begin premiering on Jetstream. MegaMan NT Warrior was licensed by Viz Media. Transformers: Animated is currently airing episodes on TV, though not on Toonami, leaving Toonami Jetstream to air reruns. It has aired all of its current episodes of Toonami Jetstream, and was re-airing them. New episodes are now being aired on television.

It was licensed by Viz Media. Storm Hawks aired its complete first season on Cartoon Network, some on Toonami. However, season two has yet to come to the U.S., giving Jetstream the chance to air it, which they never did. It is currently being distributed by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. The first two movies to air on Jetstream were Naruto The Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow and Naruto the Movie 2: Legend of the Stone of Gelel Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo, Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, and One Piece was seemingly removed from the site despite not being finished or due to dubbing issues.  RSS feed  Toonami Jetstream was offering two ways to check for updates. The first is a RSS feed on their website. Alternatively, a downloadable program called the Toonami Jetstream Desktop Receiver collected and displayed updates automatically, allowing easy access to new additions. After Toonami Jetstream became defunct, Cartoon Network Video made a desktop receiver of its own.  Promotions with the Toonami Block  The Toonami website began advertising the service on July 3, 2006. The first television promo was during Cartoon Planet on July 9, 2006. The first Toonami promo was on July 15, 2006, during a special Naruto marathon.

It took many styling cues from the 1960s Chargers (most notably the second generation) but unlike the original, had four doors. The designers attempted to blend the rear doors into the design so they would not be noticed very easily. The decision to add four doors was made due to the declining sport coupe market in North America. Compressed natural gas was purported as being in the lineup for a possible fuel source. Development History The concept's exterior design was supervised by Tom Gale, head of Chrysler's styling department. The interior design was done by design partner Trevor Creed. While the concept car shared the long nose and rearward cab of the original 1966 Dodge Charger, it was shorter overall. It was long as compared to for the 1966 Charger. It was also lighter, versus . Other design features shared with the 1966 Charger included coke-bottle styling, flying rear buttresses, full length taillamps and air intakes on the front and sides. The vehicle was fueled by CNG (compressed natural gas) technology. It had functional side scoops, and the chrome plated, central mounted exhaust was somewhat reminiscent of the Dodge Viper. The concept had functional air exhausters sculpted into its rear fascia. It used a new storage tank system to deliver a range while not compromising storage space in the trunk. The interior of the car featured bucket seats for all four occupants, a centre console running the full length of the dash board, a three-spoke steering wheel inspired by NASCAR race cars and rotary styled gauges. The interior was upholstered in black and red leather and had a carbon fiber trim. The centre console along with the back of the seats had exposed metal parts. The cylinders, or pressure cells, inside the fiberglass storage tank were lined with a gas-impermeable high density polyurethane (HDPE) thermoplastic and wrapped in a hybrid mix of high-strength carbon and super-tough glass filaments that were wound with an epoxy resin. The cylinders were laid into a foam egg crate to absorb impacts. They were designed to be strong yet lightweight, resistant to environmental damage, reliable and durable. The fuel could be stored at 3,600 lb¬≥ of pressure. The car was powered by a supercharged 289 cubic inch 4.7-liter V8 engine with 2 valves per cylinder and a single overhead cam, rated at at 6,000 rpm. The engine was mated to a five- speed manual transmission. This was the first rear wheel drive car built on the Chrysler LH platform with all of prior cars built on the same platform being front wheel drive. The car was rumored to accelerate from 0-60 mph in 5.3 seconds. Following the Daimler Chrysler merger, the management went in another direction with the future of the company, and the concept car was not placed into production. A newly developed Dodge Charger (LX) would not reach production until the 2006 model year. The new Charger bore little resemblance to the 1999 concept. The car was featured in the video game Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition.

Biography Warren was born in 1852. His father was also named Samuel Dennis Warren, known as S.D. Warren, who founded the Cumberland Paper Mills in Maine. He had four siblings: Cornelia Lyman Warren, philanthropist; Henry Clarke Warren (1854-1899), scholar of Sanskrit and Pali; Edward Perry Warren (1860-1928), art collector; Fredrick Fiske Warren (1862-1938), political radical and utopist. He graduated from Harvard College in 1875 and graduated second in his class at Harvard Law School in 1877. The first-place student was his friend Louis Brandeis, later a justice of the United States Supreme Court. Warren was editor of the Harvard Crimson. Warren and Brandeis founded the prominent Boston law firm of Nutter McClennen & Fish in 1879. At the end of 1890 they published their famous law review article \\"The Right to Privacy\\" in the Harvard Law Review. It is \\"one of the most influential essays in the history of American law\\" and is widely regarded as the first publication in the United States to advocate a right to privacy,See, e.g., Dorothy J. Glancy, \\"The Invention of the Right to Privacy\\" , Arizona Law Review, v.21, n.1, pp.1-39 (1979), p.1 (\\"The right to privacy is, as a legal concept, a fairly recent invention. It dates back to a law review article published in December of 1890 by two young Boston lawyers, Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis.\\"). articulating that right primarily as a \\"right to be let alone\\".4 Harvard L.R. 193 (Dec. 15, 1890), paragraph 1. Brandeis later acknowledged that the idea for the essay originated with Warren's \\"deep-seated abhorrance of the invasions of social privacy\\" on the part of the press.Amy Gajda, What If Samuel D. Warren Hadn‚Äôt Married A Senator‚Äôs Daughter?: Uncovering The Press Coverage That Led To \\"The Right to Privacy\\", November 1, 2007, p. 7, passim. His antipathy toward the press, she argues, derived from press coverage of his wife's family. In 1899, he left law to oversee the family's paper production business. He managed the family trust established in May 1889 with the legal assistance of Brandeis to benefit his father's widow and 5 children. In 1906, Warren's brothers Edward and Fiske charged that Brandeis had structured the trust to benefit Samuel at the expense of his siblings. The dispute ended with Samuel's suicide in 1910. The Warren Trust case became a point of contention during the 1916 Senate hearings on the confirmation of Brandeis to the Supreme Court and it remains important for its explication of legal ethics and professional responsibility. Warren served from 1902 to 1906 as president of the trustees of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. in 1883, he married Mabel Bayard, daughter of Thomas F. Bayard, U.S. Senator from Delaware from 1869 to 1885. They had six children. He committed suicide in Dedham, Massachusetts, on February 18, 1910. His family disguised his suicide and the date of his death. The New York Times reported that he died of apoplexy on February 20.

While begun as a toy company, the focus later shifted to promotional truck models as adult collectibles and the firm headquarters was moved to Holland. The company is not to be confused with Tekno, the \\"robotic\\" dog and pony. History Established in 1928, Tekno was the only Scandinavian company to become an accomplished diecast metal toy producer, somewhat similar to the German Schuco Modell, M√§rklin, or Gama Toys (Force 2002, p. 73). All of these were model firms that existed before World War II. The founder was A. Siegumfeldt, a plumber from Copenhagen, who after many years of producing wooden toys, began producing diecast vehicles post-war perhaps late 1945 (Force 2002, p. 73). Through the 1950s, Tekno gradually became a main competitor even to diecast powerhouses like Dinky (Rixon 2005, p. 34). A small electric motor by Tekno. Brochures show that the company regally celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1953. By this time a wide variety of trucks, tractors and cars were being produced along with toy miniature pots, pans and other kitchenware (Tekno Dansk 1953). Wooden houses, cranes, trucks and other toys - even small electric motors - were also made. Also in the 1950s, sometimes toys were produced in association with the Swedish company Brio. Diecasters involved Tekno diecast cars and airplanes were manufactured previous to the war, and then after, in the main factory in Kirkebjerg, west of central Copenhagen. The complete story of toy manufacturing in the company, however, is quite complex. From 1949 through about 1969, many Tekno models were also made by H. Langes Leget√∏j (Langes Toys), a die caster in Copenhagen with which Tekno apparently had an informal association (Rixon 2005, p. 35). Langes Leget√∏j also cooperated with a company called Termax - which was in the same building. Termax developed many of the cars, for example, all Mercedes models, Jaguar E type, Opel models, and the DKW Junior. They then were often produced or assembled by Lange's Leget√∏j. An early Tekno German Ford Taunus with typical two-part wheels. Some of Tekno's parts were cast in Nyrnbergade (where Langes & Termax were located) and then sent west about four miles for assembly in Kirkebjerg. Tekno even had another factory on Rentemestervej and one also in Frederikssund. Later, production was also done in Glostrup about three miles west of Kirkebjerg. Langes Toys were bought by Kirk Toys in 1958 which saw the replacement of the Tekno name with Kirk on some vehicle bases through the 1960s. In 1969, the old agreement between Langes Leget√∏j and Tekno was terminated. Kirk had existed as early as 1892 as Emil M√∏ller Phone Factory. Since 1970 the company has been traded many times. For some time it was called Kirk telecom and then in 2012 became Spectralink Europe ApS. Kirk is a family name, and in the period 1923-1967 the family stood at directorship of the phone factory. Apparently, Kirk's involvement in the toy business was a small venture compared to greater phone production.  Model Selection and details  Tekno was known for favoring Swedish auto maker Volvo, making coupes, sedan, and wagons. Some of these models were used by Volvo as promotional models. Tekno had a reputation for accuracy and realism - its Volvo models and many others like its Oldsmobile Toronado and Jaguar X-KE had superb proportions and detail (Sinclair 1979, p. 391). Tekno trucks were also known for detail, such as the Ford D-800 tilt-cab decorated for Tuborg Beer which featured thirty-two removable beer cases (Sinclair 1979, p. 391). Still, in the early 1960s, the company often used the unrealistic, flashy practice of using jeweled headlights, similar to Dinky, Corgi, or Mebetoys (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, p. 18). An analysis of one particular Tekno, no. 928, the Mercedes-Benz 230 SL convertible in 1:43 scale, shows the company's attention to detail. The model's hood, trunk, and both doors opened. The engine compartment was very detailed. Wheels were produced in three parts: rubber tire, painted wheel rim, and metal cap with the Mercedes star. The wheel detail alone gave the car a feel of being realistic and solid. The front grille was slotted and one could seen inside to the 'radiator'. On this model, headlights are done in clear plastic, though rear lights are painted onto precisely shaped metal trim. The doors open and the windows are rolled UP, unusual for diecast models since, for such detail, extra parts are necessary, raising costs. In the interior, the dashboard and steering wheel have accurate shapes and the seats not only tilt, but slide back and forth. There is a spare tire in the trunk. The chassis is painted (usually white) whereas most 1:43 diecast manufacturers often left it bare. One manufacturing problem was that with the opening doors, the front and rear sections of the car's diecast body were only connected by very narrow strips of metal causing the body to droop downward at each end, causing the rear to sag away from the doors, so the doors don't fit finely to the body. In the hands of rough youngsters this model probably did not stay in one piece very long. Promotional emphasis More than any other diecast maker, Tekno was known for its variety of liveries and their variations, which could seem nearly endless. For example, veteran collector Cecil Gibson wrote as early as 1970 how Tekno in the 1960s made its Volkswagen Transporter panel truck and Ford Taunus vans in many liveries, such as the Dutch Amstel Beer, and for Scandinavian products such as the Politiken newspaper, or the more well known Scania (Gibson 1970, pages 28‚Äì29). Tekno's Scania and Volvo trucks were also offered with a variety of advertising on their flanks. In fact, Tekno may have been the earliest diecast company to focus on promotional products, perhaps even earlier than Winross Models' diecast trucks out of Rochester, New York - known in the United States for having many promotional variations. An older, simpler Tekno toy bus. Teckno had already in 1935 agreements with Falck, concerning advertising of tinplate cars. A more commercial use of advertisements on toy cars started with the VW van in 1953 Tekno boxes were normally rather dull, usually being red with illustrations of the cars on the sides. Earlier boxes showed illustrations of cars in various street scenes. Some of the colors could be brighter, however, as with the chartreuse color used on boxes introducing \\"Fingertip Styring\\" (sic)(Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, p. 37). Oddly, a 'cut-off' hand appeared apparently out of the sky to touch and guide the car along. Through the 1960s, boxes became more simple as cars were portrayed with apertures closed - and then open on the opposite side (Rixon 2005, p. 35). The red box flaps showed the car in a yellow or white band across the center of the flap, or boxes were red on one side and blue on the other (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996 pp 36‚Äì37). Later, and like the rest of the industry, plastic window boxes with white and red trim became commonplace - obviously putting some talented graphic artists out of work (Ilich 1995-2000). Copies and comparisons Normally producing in 1:43 scale, Tekno's principal rivals were Corgi and Dinky - formidable competition. Models produced often mimicked their offerings, like the Commer estate or the later Oldsmobile Toronado, both models made by Corgi. Still, Tekno always had a personality all its own, offering unique vehicles (particularly those Swedish Saabs and Volvos). One example was the 1970 Volvo 144 police sedan or the Saab 99. Another was the Corvair Monza concept vehicle, produced in several colors - later reproduced by Auto Pilen of Spain. Some Tekno original tooling for 1960s Tekno models was also sold to Dalia of Spain, like several Volvo, Ford, and Lincoln models. In contrast with most other diecast car producers, Tekno did not give in to the temptation of low friction, flashy wheels on their vehicles. Though the company remained loyal to its roots in producing more realistic models, this was not good for sales. Gradually, the variety of cars and other vehicles gave way to marketing only diecast trucks - often still for promotional purposes. At least this strategy helped the company survive, though more in the mode of German Conrad or NZG. Some earlier models suffered occasionally from zinc pest and warping or bending chassis (perhaps from moldings that were unreinforced), but, overall, Tekno vehicles were of high quality finish. Later history Some Tekno cars were marketed in the United States by Kayeff, Inc. of Arcadia, California in blister packages. Unlike Lonestar Toys sold in the U.S. by Physio-Chem, which did not advertise the Lonestar name on packaging, the Kayeff cars proudly displayed the Tekno logo on the blister and stated boldly \\"It's from Denmark!\\" with the Danish flag and crown prominently shown (Hobby Talk 2008). The cars were more likely to be colored in more \\"spectra-flame\\"-type colors, perhaps in an attempt to compete with Mattel's Hot Wheels. A few years ago, one of these was reported to have sold for $800.00. Details of Tekno DAF 95 cab. MPC also marketed some Tekno trucks and cars as MPC. These were castings made by Kirk (Hobby Talk 2008). They were advertised as \\"Strip 'n Steer Metal Precision Trucks\\" as they could be taken apart and re-assembled. Sometime in the late 1960s, Tekno models were also offered through a special mail order ad by Road and Track magazine (Hobby Talk 2008). Tekno Holland Sinclair and Force both say that Tekno ceased making toys in 1972 (Force 2002, p. 73; Sinclair 1979, p. 391). In 1974, Tekno tooling was sold to a Dutch firm called Vanmin, BV, controlled by one Leslie Hurle Bath, an English businessman (Force 2002, p. 73). Thus Tekno, now with the name \\"Tekno Toys\\" continued as a firm, but now in the Netherlands. In 1989, due to the promotional and adult collector focus of Teknos offerings, the word \\"Toys\\" was dropped from the name (Tekno website). As of 2017, the company was still in business, mainly making truck models with a variety of promotional liveries, though Force says Tekno was defunct as of 2002 (Hobby Talk 2008; Force 2002, p. 73).

It has been created as part of a government-funded wetlands scheme to halt the decline of wild and endangered birds caused by the drainage and development of former wetland sites. It is the largest man-made marine wetland area in the United Kingdom. The wetland spans an area of 115 hectares and is sited on Wallasea Island, which borders two rivers (River Crouch to the north and River Roach to the south-east). They provide winter grounds for wading birds, as well as breeding and nursery areas for aquatic wildlife, such as bass, mullet, flatfish and herring and even some types of dolphin. The area will also help to reduce the flooding of properties near the River Crouch by providing a run-off area for floodwaters. In the process being termed \\"managed re-alignment\\", the seawall that protects croplands and property was re-established in more tenable positions, three miles behind the new wetlands, which will provide habitat for birds like oystercatchers, avocets and little terns, according to the press release issued at the time. Walkers and birdwatchers will be able to enjoy the scenery by means of a new footpath that has been built on the top of this new relocated sea wall. Construction was completed in 2006 and by 2011 the land had evolved into wetland, mudflats, saline lagoons and seven artificial islands, allowing the wildlife to reside on these areas. An extension to the scheme, using 2,400 shiploads of spoil excavated from London's Crossrail tunnels, was completed in July 2015, when an additional area of land was opened to tidal flow. The whole project is expected to be completed by 2025. History Wetlands have existed on Wallasea Island since ancient times, when much of the Essex coastline was bordered by rich breeding grounds for birds. In the 15th century these lands were drained by Dutch settlers for agricultural use with the construction of the original sea wall. Over time more wetland areas were drained for development, leading to the reduction and endangerment of the wildlife that depended on it. During the late 1980s and early 1990s two areas of salt marsh and mud flat at Lappel Bank in the Medway Estuary in Kent and Fagbury Flats in the Orwell Estuary in Suffolk (both on the east coast of England) were drained and port developments at Sheerness and Felixstowe were built in their place. The European Court of Justice ruled that under the European Birds Directive these wetlands had to be replaced, and it was decided that new wetlands should be created. The following criteria for Wallasea Wetlands has been met in accordance with this ruling: * they will complement and uphold existing coastal strategies and not impact on other local environmentally sensitive sites * they will create an attractive, sustainable site for the bird population that has been displaced over a 50- to 70-year period * they will provide additional flood and storm protection for the area * they will create an attractive environment for local people that would not impact negatively on existing business or leisure activities In 2005, the ¬£7.5million project to return the island to its original salt marsh was commenced, beginning with the construction of the new sea defence wall, defining the area where the tides were permitted to flood. Work was completed on 4 July 2006, when 300m of the original sea wall were bulldozed, allowing sea tides to flood the area at high tide.

Described by Pierre Bulliard in 1790, it was also known as Tricholoma nudum for many years. It is found in both coniferous and deciduous woodlands. It is a fairly distinctive mushroom that is widely eaten, though there is some caution about edibility. Nevertheless, it has been cultivated in Britain, the Netherlands and France. Taxonomy and naming The French mycologist Pierre Bulliard described the wood blewit in his work Herbier de la France in 1790 as Agaricus nudus, reporting that it was common in the woods all year. He wrote of two varieties: one whose gills and cap are initially light violet and mature to burgundy, while the other has vine-coloured gills that intensify in colour with age. He added that the first variety was often confused with Cortinarius violaceus, though it has a \\"nude\\" cap and no spidery web veil unlike the other species. English naturalist James Bolton gave it the name Agaricus bulbosa‚Äîthe bulbous agaric‚Äîin his An History of Fungusses growing about Halifax in 1791. He noted that it was rare in the region, though had found some in Ovenden. German mycologist Paul Kummer placed it in the genus Tricholoma in 1871, the same year that English botanist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke placed it in Lepista. It was known by these names for many years, with some authors accepting Lepista and while others retained the wood blewit in Tricholoma. In 1969 Howard E. Bigelow and Alexander H. Smith reviewed Lepista and reclassified it as a subgenus of Clitocybe Finnish mycologist Harri Harmaja has called for the sinking of Lepista into Clitocybe, with C. nebularis as the type species of the latter genus.Harmaja, H. (2003). Notes on Clitocybe s. lato (Agaricales). Ann. Bot. Fennici 40: 213-218. Hence the wood blewit is classified as either Lepista nuda or Clitocybe nuda. A 2015 genetic study found that the genera Collybia and Lepista were closely related to the core clade of Clitocybe, but that all three were polyphyletic, with many members in lineages removed from other members of the same genus and instead more closely related to the other two. To complicate matters, the wood blewit is not closely related to the type species of Lepista, L. densifolia. Alvarado and colleagues declined to define the genera but proposed several options and highlighted the need for a wider analysis. The species is commonly known as the wood blewit. Cooke called it the amethyst lepista, John Sibthorp called it the blue-gilled agaric in his 1794 work Flora Oxoniensis. Description This mushroom can range from lilac to purple-pink. Some North American specimens are duller and tend toward tan, but usually have purplish tones on the stem and gills. The gills are attached to the short, stout stem. Mature specimens have a darker color and flatter cap; younger ones are lighter with more convex caps. Wood blewits have a very distinctive odor, which has been likened by one author to that of frozen orange juice. Lepista nuda Wood blewits can be confused with certain purple species of the genus Cortinarius, including the uncommon C. camphoratus, many of which may be poisonous. Cortinarius mushrooms often have the remains of a veil under their caps and a ring-like impression on their stem. Wood blewits can be easily distinguished by their odor, as well as by their spore print. Wood blewits have a light (white to pale pink) spore print; Cortinarius species produce a rusty brown spore print after several hours on white paper. Their brown spores often dust their stems and objects beneath them. Distribution and habitat The wood blewit is found in Europe and North America and is becoming more common in Australia, where it appears to have been introduced. In Australia it has developed a relationship with some eucalyptus species and gorse; with an entirely different growth pattern and differs slightly in appearance to its European Lepista Nuda cousins. It is referred to as 'The Purple Nudist mushroom' a common name coined by Australian Free Food Forager Ingrid Button in 2016. It is a saprotrophic species, growing on decaying leaf litter. In the United Kingdom, it appears from September through to December. Soil analysis of soil containing mycelium from a wood blewit fairy ring under Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in southeast Sweden yielded fourteen halogenated low molecular weight organic compounds, three of which were brominated and the others chlorinated. It is unclear whether these were metabolites or pollutants. Brominated compounds are unknown as metabolites from terrestrial fungi. Ecology In Australia, male satin bowerbirds collect blue objects to decorate their bowers with. A young male was reported to have collected wood blewits to this end near Braidwood in southern New South Wales. Edibility Wood blewits are generally regarded as a good edible, but they are known to cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. This is particularly likely if the mushroom is consumed raw, though allergic reactions are known even from cooked blewits. It is therefore important to cook wood blewits before eating, as consumption of raw specimens could lead to indigestion. Wood blewits contain the sugar trehalose, which is edible for most people. Blewits can be eaten as a cream sauce or saut√©ed in butter. They can also be cooked like tripe or as omelette filling, and also make good stewing mushrooms. They have a strong flavour, so they combine well with leeks or onions. Wood blewits can be preserved in olive oil or white vinegar after blanching. The wood blewit has been cultivated in Britain, the Netherlands and France. Cultivated wood blewits are said not to taste as good as wild wood blewits. Footnotes External links * Harmaja, H. (2003).

He was one of the first white settlers in the future Indianapolis area. McCormick's Creek State Park, near Spencer, Indiana, is named after him. History Marker at the site of McCormick's cabin John Wesley McCormick was born near Winchester, Virginia, on 30 August 1754. He served in the Revolutionary war from 1776 to 1783, his first enlistment being with Captain James Robinson's Company in Col. Church's regiment, He enlisted in January 1778, in Captain James Shelley's Company and afterwards served in Captain Mark's Company of the 14th Virginia regiment, then with the same Company in the 10th Virginia regiment under Col. Charles Lewis. His last enlistment was from Pennsylvania for three months' service. Part of his service was against the Indians on the frontier, where he engaged in a fight on the Wataga River. His residence at the time of his first enlistment was Molachucky River, Virginia, now a part of Tennessee. With the expiration of his second enlistment in 1780 he moved to Bedford, Pennsylvania, where on 24 March he married Catherine Drennen (born 25 January 1769 in Pennsylvania). In 1808 the whole family moved to Ohio, settling in Preble County not far from Eaton. The overland trip was made in wagons, then down the Ohio River in flatboats. They remained in Ohio only a short time before moving to the territory of Indiana, accompanied by John's two brothers (Samuel and James) and their families. They lived initially at the fort at Connersville because of trouble with the Indians, but John was the first man to leave the protection of the fort to look for permanent settlement. In 1816 he settled nearly along a canyon by waterfalls in what later became Owen County, in the area of what is now McCormick's Creek State Park. On 11 December 1816 Indiana became the nineteenth state admitted into the union. John's son, John Wesley McCormick, Jr., built the first white settlement in Indianapolis, a log cabin on the east bank of the White River in 1820, where he lived with his wife Bethia Case McCormick and their eight children. John Jr. also built a tavern where a meeting was held in June 1820 to decide the location of the capital of the new state of Indiana. In 1822 be became one of the first county commissioners of Indiana, and in 1825 the state capital was moved from Corydon to Indianapolis. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs John died on 18 April 1837, aged 83, and Catherine died 22 February 1862, aged 93. The site of the John McCormick Jr. log cabin is today marked with a rock in the White River State Park, and a student residence at nearby Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) is named after him.

She was the eldest of fifteen children of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, and his wife Anne of Bohemia and Hungary.Duczmal (2012), p. 164 A member of the House of Habsburg, she was married off to Sigismund II Augustus, who was already crowned as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania even though both of his parents were still alive and well. The marriage was short and unhappy. Elizabeth was of frail health, suffering from epileptic seizures, and died at age 18.  Marriage plans  Elizabeth at age four by Jakob Seisenegger Elizabeth spent most of her childhood in the Hofburg, Innsbruck. She was raised with strict discipline and received a good education from humanist Kaspar Ursinus Velius, but was not taught the Polish language despite her early arranged marriage to Sigismund II Augustus.Duczmal (2012), p. 165 The marriage plan was first discussed when Elizabeth was just one year old. Louis, King of Hungary and Bohemia, died in August 1526 without leaving an heir. The Hungarian throne was contested between Louis' brother-in-law Ferdinand I and John Z√°polya. Louis' uncle Sigismund I the Old and Hungarian nobility supported Z√°polya. The marriage of Elizabeth to Sigismund's son was proposed as the means to discontinue Polish support to Z√°polya. Polish Queen Bona Sforza opposed the wedding as she opposed the growing influence of the Habsburgs.Duczmal (2012), pp. 165‚Äì167 In February 1530, ten-year-old Sigismund II Augustus was co-crowned vivente rege as King of Poland (his father was still alive and of strong health) to secure his inheritance in Poland.Duczmal (2012), p. 525 Envoys of George, Duke of Saxony, attended the coronation ceremony and negotiated the marriage between Elizabeth and Sigismund August on behalf of Ferdinand.Duczmal (2012), p. 166 Great Chancellor of the Crown Krzysztof Szyd≈Çowiecki supported the wedding and organized a preliminary marriage treaty, signed on 10‚Äì11 November 1530 in Pozna≈Ñ. According to the treaty, the marriage was to take place in 1533 when Elizabeth reached the age of 7. Her dowry was 100,000 ducats. In exchange, the Poles would grant her the cities of Nowy SƒÖcz, Sanok, Przemy≈õl, Biecz. Sigismund Augustus and Elizabeth were first cousins once removed. (Casimir IV Jagiellon was a great-grandfather of Elizabeth and a grandfather of Sigismund August). This close relationship required a matrimonial dispensation, which was issued by Pope Clement VII on 24 August 1531. The final marriage treaty, delayed mostly due to the opposition by Bona Sforza, was signed only on 16 June 1538 in Breslau ( now Wroc≈Çaw) by Johannes Dantiscus. The treaty did not differ from the preliminary treaty of 1530 other than the age of the bride which was now set at 16. The betrothal ceremony took place on 17 July 1538 in Innsbruck. Bona continued to lobby against the marriage and instead proposed Princess Margaret of France.Duczmal (2012), pp. 166‚Äì167  Queen of Poland  Elizabeth and a twelve-person escort departed Vienna on 21 April 1543.Duczmal (2012), p. 167 She was met at Olomouc by Samuel Maciejowski, Bishop of P≈Çock and a retinue of 1,500 knights. On 5 May 1543, Elizabeth entered Krak√≥w and met Sigismund Augustus for the first time. The same day 16-year-old Elizabeth married 22-year-old Sigismund Augustus in the Wawel Cathedral. The wedding celebration continued for two weeks. She was also crowned as Queen of Poland, which only increased the ire of Bona Sforza who detested her title of \\"Old Queen\\". Elizabeth's sarcophagus (on the right) on display in Vilnius Cathedral in 1930s The marriage was not happy. Sigismund Augustus, who already had several mistresses, did not find Elizabeth attractive and continued to have extramarital affairs.Duczmal (2012), pp. 167‚Äì168 Raised in a strict household to be obedient, Elizabeth was too timid and meek. A long journey from Austria to Poland further deteriorated her frail health. She was diagnosed with epilepsy and started having seizures. At the same time Bona openly expressed her dislike of Elizabeth and continued to search for ways to destroy the marriage. Bona questioned the wording of the matrimonial dispensation; a new dispensation was issued on 17 May 1544.Duczmal (2012), p. 168‚Äì169 On the other hand, Polish nobility liked and sympathized with Elizabeth ‚Äì a young, pleasant woman ignored by her husband and taunted by her ambitious mother-in- law.Duczmal (2012), p. 170 Her father-in-law Sigismund I the Old was also sympathetic to her, but was too weak to protect her from Bona.Duczmal (2012), p. 171 Two months after the wedding, a plague reached Krak√≥w and the royal family departed the capital city.Duczmal (2012), p. 168 Sigismund Augustus left for the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, while Sigismund I the Old, Bona, and Elizabeth toured various cities in Poland. After a year of separation, the couple met in Brest. Sigismund Augustus liked living independently in Lithuania and convinced his father to entrust him with ruling over the Grand Duchy.Duczmal (2012), p. 169 In fall 1544, Elizabeth and Sigismund Augustus moved to Vilnius. For a few months Sigismund Augustus attempted to keep up appearances of a successful marriage to appease the Habsburgs, but soon started ignoring his wife and continued his affair with Barbara Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. In April 1545, Elizabeth's health deteriorated and she was tormented by increasingly frequent seizures. On 8 June 1545, Sigismund Augustus went to Krak√≥w to receive Elizabeth's dowry, leaving his wife alone in Vilnius. In Krak√≥w, Sigismund Augustus inquired about treatments and asked Ferdinand I to send his own doctors. But it was too late. On 15 June, the young queen died exhausted by her many epileptic seizures. She was buried on 24 July 1545 (after her husband returned from Krak√≥w) in Vilnius Cathedral next to her husband's uncle, King Alexander Jagiellon. After Elizabeth's death Sigismund Augustus married his mistress Barbara Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç and, after her death, Elizabeth's younger sister, Catherine of Austria. Sigismund had no children from his three wives.

C.) was a prominent conservative American radio broadcaster from the 1930s to the 1960s. Early life and career Lewis was born into influential circles in the nation's capital.The site where the summer home of the Lewis family stood in Washington, D.C. is now the site of the National Cathedral He remained close to the circles of power all his life (President Herbert Hoover and his wife attended the wedding of Lewis and Alice Huston, who was the daughter of former Republican National Committee chairman Claudius Hart Huston) He was an indifferent student; he attended the University of Virginia for three years (where he was a member of the Virginia Glee Club and wrote the music for that school's official fight song, The Cavalier Song). He dropped out of UVa, but soon after enrolled in the George Washington University Law School. He left that institution when he obtained a reporting job with the Washington Herald newspaper. He found his niche in news reporting, and within three years was the paper's City editor. During that time he met and courted his future wife. Radio career WKIC in Hazard, Kentucky. Lewis left the Herald to join Universal News Service, run by the Hearst family. Between 1933 and 1936 Lewis wrote a newspaper column called \\"The Washington Sideshow\\" which was syndicated by King Features. His radio career began when he volunteered to fill in for a vacationing news reporter. The head of Washington AM radio station WOL was impressed with Lewis' \\"on-the- spot\\" reporting and offered him a full-time position. His commentaries were broadcast nationally by the Mutual Broadcasting System. Lewis' commentary program (presented as a \\"news\\" program, but which allowed him to choose his topic and to give his opinions in depth) ran from 7:00-7:15 p.m. Eastern time, five days a week. His audience liked Lewis' folksy broadcasting style. At his commercial peak, Lewis was heard on more than 500 radio stations and boasted a weekly audience of sixteen million listeners. His signature closing was \\"That's the top of the news as it looks from here.\\" He also transitioned briefly to television in the early 1950s but the format of his program did not appeal in that medium, so he returned to radio for the remainder of his career. Lewis was a conservative commentator who supported Barry Goldwater for President, supported limited government and federalism, and opposed liberal leaders such as John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and their policies. He first made his mark by opposing the New Deal policies of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (although he initially admired the man upon his first election), and as the world lurched toward World War II in the late 1930s he strongly supported the America First Committee, along with famed aviator Charles Lindbergh in their efforts to keep the US out of what he considered \\"the European War\\". He strongly opposed FDR's re-election in 1944, and also the election campaign of FDR's successor Harry S. Truman in 1948. After the war, Lewis was avidly anti-communist, and strongly backed Senator Joe McCarthy. He was one of the first broadcasters to expose Julius and Ethel Rosenberg as the communist spies that the Venona papers proved they were, although he was later accused of antisemitism as well. He despised Earl Warren, even, at one point, calling to lynch him: \\"I wouldn't impeach him. I'd lynch him.\\" Even after McCarthy was disgraced nationwide, Lewis continued to strongly champion him, and this did much to reduce his nationwide radio audience and appeal. He continued on air, however, until his death in 1966, after which his son Fulton Lewis III kept the broadcast running for another twelve years. Legacy Lewis was influential in persuading the U.S. Congress to allow radio broadcasting of Congressional activities. Among those who worked for Lewis was Kenneth Tomlinson, former head of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), an agency whose existence Lewis would have denounced. In this position, Tomlinson has worked to eliminate what he calls liberal bias at the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. One of CPB's ombudsmen, Bill Schulz, was a writer for Lewis and for Human Events. Schulz and Tomlinson were also colleagues at Reader's Digest. Lewis wrote the words for \\"The Cavalier Song\\" for the University of Virginia while a student there. The song was featured in the 2000 movie Bring It On. In 1942 Lewis was the first recipient of the Alfred I. duPont Award.All duPont‚ÄìColumbia Award Winners , Columbia Journalism School. Retrieved 2013-08-06.

Hawkins and three friends were attacked by a crowd of 10 to 30 white youths, with at least seven of them wielding baseball bats. One, armed with a handgun, shot Hawkins twice in the chest, killing him. Mob turncoat Joseph D‚ÄôAngelo confessed that he caused the racially motivated killing. Incident Al Sharpton leading the first protest march over the death of Yusef Hawkins in Bensonhurst, 1989. Hawkins had gone to Bensonhurst that night with three friends to inquire about a used 1982 Pontiac automobile that was for sale. The group's attackers had been lying in wait for black youths that were expected to attend a party at the home of a teenage girl in the neighborhood. {cite web url= https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1120793.html} Some say the girl had previously dated one of the killers and/or she had invited black youths to her neighborhood to taunt the neighborhood boys. {cite web url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/11/storm-over-brooklyn- yusuf-hawkins-hbo} Hawkins and his friends walked onto the ambushers' block unaware that local residents were waiting to attack any group of black youths they saw. After the murder of Hawkins, police said that he had not in any way been involved with the neighborhood girl whom the killers believed Hawkins was dating. Hawkins' death was the third killing of a black male by white mobs in New York City during the 1980s; the other two victims were Willie Turks, who was killed on June 22, 1982, in Brooklyn, and Michael Griffith, who was killed in Queens on December 20, 1986. The incident uncorked a torrent of racial tension in New York City in the ensuing days and weeks, culminating in a series of protest marches through the neighborhood led by the Reverend Al Sharpton. Trials The two teenagers who led the mob that beat and chased Hawkins were tried separately. Joseph Fama, the man who fired the shots that killed Hawkins, was convicted of second-degree murder on May 17, 1990. The other main defendant in the case, Keith Mondello, was acquitted on May 18, 1990 on murder and manslaughter charges, but convicted of 12 lesser charges including riot, menacing, discrimination, unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a weapon.Kurtz, Howard. \\"Bensonhurst Ringleader Acquitted on Murder Counts\\" The Washington Post May 19, 1990, A1. The acquittal of Mondello on the most serious charges led to further protest marches through Bensonhurst led by Al Sharpton. On June 11, 1990, sentences were handed down in the Hawkins case. 19-year-old Fama received a sentence of 32‚Öì years to life in prison. Mondello, also 19, received a sentence of 5‚Öì to 16 years in prison.Kurtz, Howard. \\"Bensonhurst Defendants Receive Maximum Terms\\" The Washington Post, June 12, 1992, A1. Other members of the gang that chased and beat Hawkins were tried as well. John Vento was convicted of unlawful imprisonment and received a sentence of 2 to 8 years in August 1990 and was released in 1998. A fourth man, Joseph Serrano, was convicted on the charge of unlawfully possessing a weapon and sentenced to 300 hours of community service on January 11, 1991. The acquittal of Vento on a murder charge, and the light sentence handed out to Serrano, sparked more protests by the African-American community in Bensonhurst. Shortly before that march was set to begin on January 12, 1991, Al Sharpton was stabbed and seriously wounded by Michael Riccardi in a Bensonhurst schoolyard. Sharpton later recovered from his wounds. Riccardi was convicted of first-degree assault and sentenced to 5 to 15 years in prison, despite a plea for leniency by Sharpton himself, who believed that distorted news coverage of his activities had influenced his attacker.https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/17/nyregion/attacker-of-sharpton-is- sentenced.html Keith Mondello was said to be the ‚Äúinstigator and organizer‚Äù of the group and served 8 years In prison. Nearly 16 years after the shooting, mob turncoat Joseph D‚ÄôAngelo admitted the group behind Yusuf‚Äôs murder was there on his orders and he caused the racially motivated killing. He also admitted he lied to police and asked a woman who knew many details to not tell police. Release of Mondello After serving eight years in the Attica Correctional Facility, Keith Mondello was released on June 2, 1998. On January 22, 1999, Mondello and Hawkins' father, Moses Stewart, met in a NY1 television studio, where Mondello apologized for his role in the killing.Associated Press, \\"2 Sides Meet in '89 Racial Killing\\" The New York Times, January 22, 1999, p.

A number of subjects share similar spellings. See Blewitt and Bluet for disambiguation. Blewit refers to two closely related species of edible agarics in the genus Clitocybe, the wood blewit (Clitocybe nuda) and the field blewit or blue-leg (C.saeva). Both species are treated by some authorities as belonging to the genus Lepista. Classification Both species have been treated by many authorities as belonging to the Clitocybe segregate genus Lepista. Recent molecular research suggests the genus Lepista is nested within Clitocybe.Moncalvo JM. et al. (2002). One hundred and seventeen clades of euagarics. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 23:357‚Äì400 Edibility Both wood blewits and field blewits are generally regarded as edible, but they are known to cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. This is particularly likely if the mushroom is consumed raw, though allergic reactions are known even from cooked blewits. Wood blewits contain the sugar trehalose, which is edible for most people. Field blewits are often infested with fly larvae and do not store very well; they should therefore be used soon after picking. They are also very porous, so they are best picked on a dry day. In most mycologists' opinion, the blewits are considered excellent mushrooms, despite their coloration. Blewits can be eaten as a cream sauce or saut√©ed in butter, but it is important not to eat them raw, which could lead to indigestion. They can also be cooked like tripe or as omelette filling, and wood blewits also make good stewing mushrooms.

Story In the 1920s, just after the First World War, in an Irish village named Kilshannon, Edwina Broome has moved into the neighbourhood known as \\"Widows' Peak\\", named for the prevalent marital status of the residents, who are a rather exclusive group. The residents are curious about their new neighbour, Edwina, but information is not available about her, even for the leader of the place, Mrs. Doyle Counihan, whose son is busy attempting to attract Edwina. Miss O'Hare and Edwina immediately dislike each other, however, and soon some accidental encounters begin to look like Edwina is trying to ruin her new rival. The problems escalate and the town is in an uproar, but they get no closer to solving the mystery of the newcomer.Ed Sutton, Widows' Peak Summary https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111712/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl Production notes The film was mainly shot on location in the counties of Wicklow, Dublin and Kilkenny. The concept for the film came from its co-producer Prudence Farrow. While it had been intended for her mother Maureen O'Sullivan to play the role of Miss O'Hare, the part went to O'Sullivan's daughter and Prudence's sister Mia Farrow. O'Sullivan declined the part due to her advanced age and dwindling stamina. Set in the 1920s, the film's period wardrobe needs were handled by Angels and Bermans as well as Costumi d'Arte and European Costume Company. Consolata Boyle was the costume designer. The film grossed $6.2 million in U.S. theatrical release. Reception The film was well received by critics and the public. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said, the film \\"uses understated humor and fluent, witty speech; it's a delight to listen to, as it gradually reveals how eccentric these apparently respectable people really are.\\"\\"Widows' Peak\\" 25 May 1994 http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/widows-peak-1994 Awards In 1995, the actress Natasha Richardson received the Crystal Globe award at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, Czech Republic, for her role in this film.

She has achieved the rank of Captain in the United States Navy. She is also a qualified and experienced salvage officer. Her major salvage projects include de-stranding the tanker Exxon Houston off the coast of Barbers Point, on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, and developing the plan for the Peruvian Navy salvage of the Peruvian submarine . Stefanyshyn-Piper has received numerous honors and awards, such as the Meritorious Service Medal, two Navy Commendation Medals, and two Navy Achievement Medals. She has flown on two Space Shuttle missions, STS-115 and STS-126, during which she completed five spacewalks totaling 33 hours and 42 minutes. As of , she ranks 39th on the all-time list of space walkers by duration. Early life and education Stefanyshyn-Piper was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, United States, of Ukrainian-American heritage. Her father, Michael (Mykhailo) Stefanyshyn, now deceased, was born in Polish- governed Halychyna (today in Ukraine), and sent to work in Germany during World War II. After the end of the war, he married a German woman and they both immigrated to the U.S. Stefanyshyn-Piper's mother, Adelheid Stefanyshyn, lived in St. Paul until her death in 2018. Stefanyshyn-Piper was raised in the Ukrainian cultural community of Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul, is a member of Plast ‚Äì a Ukrainian scouting organization, and speaks Ukrainian. Stefanyshyn-Piper graduated in 1980 from what was then the all-girls Derham Hall High School in St. Paul, and holds Bachelor of Science (1984) and Master of Science (1985) degrees in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). She is a licensed ham radio operator with Technician License KD5TVR. Stefanyshyn-Piper married Glenn A. Piper, and they have one son, Michael, named after Piper's grandfather. Stefanyshyn-Piper hyphenated her surname after marriage to serve as a reminder of her family roots. Military career Stefanyshyn-Piper received her commission from the Naval ROTC Program at MIT in June 1985. She completed training at the Naval Diving and Salvage Training Center in Panama City, Florida as a Navy Basic Diving Officer and Salvage Officer. During her Salvage tour, she participated in the de-stranding of the tanker Exxon Houston off the coast of Barbers Point in Hawaii. As of July 2009, Stefanyshyn-Piper was a Captain in the United States Navy. During her military career, she was awarded: the Defense Superior Service Medal, two Legion of Merit medals, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal, two Navy Commendation Medals, two Navy Achievement Medals, and other service medals. NASA career Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in April 1996, Stefanyshyn-Piper reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996. After two years of training and evaluation, she qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. Initially assigned to astronaut support duties for launch and landing, she has also served as lead Astronaut Office Representative for Payloads and in the Astronaut Office EVA branch.  STS-115 - Atlantis (September 9-21, 2006)  STS-115 crew Stefanyshyn-Piper flew her first mission on STS-115, aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis (launched September 9, 2006, and returned September 21), as a Mission Specialist and became only the 8th woman to perform a spacewalk (out of 180 total spacewalkers). Stefanyshyn-Piper's participation in two of the mission's three EVAs for a total of 12 hours, 8 minutes made her the second most experienced female spacewalker. She also became the first Minnesota woman to go into space. *EVA One (Duration 5 hours, 26 minutes)  With astronaut Joe Tanner, Stefanyshyn-Piper conducted initial installation of the P3/P4 truss onto the space station. Connected power cables on the truss, released the launch restraints on the solar array blanket box, the Beta Gimbal Assembly, and the solar array wings. Configured the Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ), and removed two circuit interrupt devices to prepare for STS-116. Stefanyshyn-Piper became the seventh American woman to conduct a spacewalk. *EVA Three (Duration 6 hours, 42 minutes)  With astronaut Joe Tanner, Stefanyshyn-Piper installed a radiator onto the P3/4 truss, powered up a cooling radiator for the new solar arrays, replaced an S-Band radio antenna, and installed insulation for another antenna. Tanner took photos of the shuttle's wings using an infrared camera to test the camera's ability to detect damage. During her pre-flight interview, she described her philosophy about human exploration of space: Piper fainted twice during the STS-115 welcome home ceremony. The NASA flight surgeon who assisted her noted that \\"for a returning astronaut, the symptoms she experienced are very normal for what can occur during re-adaptation\\".  NEEMO 12 (May 7‚Äì18, 2007)  NEEMO 12 crew. L-R: Josef Schmid, Stefanyshyn- Piper, James Talacek, Dominic Landucci, Jos√© M. Hern√°ndez and Timothy J. Broderick. Stefanyshyn-Piper was commander of the 12th expedition of NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO), a NASA program for studying human survival in the Aquarius underwater laboratory in preparation for future space exploration.  STS-126 - Endeavour (November 14‚Äì30, 2008)  Stefanyshyn-Piper flew as a Mission Specialist on STS-126, aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour (launched November 14, 2008, and returned November 30), during which she participated in and was Lead Spacewalker on three of four spacewalks. The mission ended when Endeavour landed successfully at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Following Stefanyshyn-Piper's third spacewalk during STS-126, her fifth overall, her total time in EVA became 33 hours, 42 minutes, putting her in twenty-fifth place for total time in EVA. STS-126 crew *EVA One (Duration 6 hours, 52 minutes)  With astronaut Stephen G. Bowen, Stefanyshyn-Piper transferred an empty nitrogen tank assembly from ESP3 to the shuttle's cargo bay, transferred a new flex hose rotary coupler to ESP3 for future use, removed an insulation cover on the Kibo External Facility berthing mechanism, began cleaning and lubrication of the starboard SARJ, and replacement of its 11 trundle bearing assemblies. *EVA Two (Duration 6 hours, 45 minutes)  With astronaut Robert S. Kimbrough, Stefanyshyn-Piper relocated the two Crew and Equipment Translation Aid (CETA) carts from the starboard side of the Mobile Transporter to the port side, lubricated the station robotic arm's latching end effector A snare bearings, continued cleaning and lubrication of the starboard SARJ. EVA was conducted on the station's tenth anniversary. *EVA Three (Duration 6 hours, 57 minutes)  With astronaut Stephen G. Bowen, Stefanyshyn-Piper completed cleaning and lubrication of all but one of the trundle bearing assemblies (TBA) on the starboard SARJ. The final TBA was replaced during EVA 4. Lost tool bag during spacewalk Stefanyshyn-Piper (left) and Shane Kimbrough, STS-126 mission specialists, in the mission's second scheduled session of EVA on the International Space Station During the first EVA of STS-126 on November 18, 2008, as Stefanyshyn- Piper was preparing to begin work on the Solar Alpha Rotary Joint, she noticed a significant amount of grease in her tool bag. \\"I think we had a grease gun explode in the large bag, because there's grease in the bag,\\" Stefanyshyn- Piper reported to Kimbrough, who was working inside the shuttle to help coordinate the EVA. Mission Control managers instructed Stefanyshyn-Piper to clean up the grease using a dry wipe, and while she was doing the cleanup, she accidentally pushed aside the bag. \\"I guess one of my crew lock bags was not transferred and it's loose,\\" Stefanyshyn-Piper told Kimbrough. The bag floated aft and starboard of the station, and did not pose a risk to the station or orbiter. The bag and its contents entered Low Earth Orbit as space debris, where it eventually burned-up as it entered the Earth's atmosphere west of Mexico on August 3, 2009.Tariq Malik, Managing Editor, Space.com \\"Tool Bag Lost In Space Meets Fiery End\\" August 3, 2009 When in orbit, it was visible from the ground using a telescope. After taking an inventory of the items inside the lost bag, managers on the ground determined that Bowen had all those items in his bag, and the two could share equipment. While it extended the EVA duration slightly, the major objectives were not changed. The estimated value of the equipment lost is US$100,000. During the Mission Status Briefing, lead International Space Station Flight Director Ginger Kerrick said that there was no way to know what caused the bag to come loose. \\"We don't know that this incident occurred because they forgot to tether something. We don't know if perhaps the hook just came loose inside the bag,\\" Kerrick said. \\"You've got to remember, we are working with humans here and we are prone to human error. We do the best we can, and we learn from our mistakes.\\" Said Stefanyshyn-Piper of the incident, \\"that definitely was not the high point of the EVA. It was very disheartening to watch it float away.\\" Retirement from NASA In July 2009, Stefanyshyn-Piper retired from NASA's Astronaut Corps to return to her Navy duties. Fellow astronaut Steven Lindsey, Chief of the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, stated on her retirement: \\"Heide has been an outstanding astronaut, contributing significantly to the Space Shuttle and Space Station programs. In particular, her superb leadership as lead spacewalker during the STS-126 mission resulted in restoring full power generation capability to the International Space Station. We wish her the best of luck back in the Navy ‚Äì she will be missed.\\" She was awarded two NASA Space Flight Medals, and the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. In August 2009, Stefanyshyn-Piper reported to the Naval Sea Systems Command as the Chief Technology Officer. Further Navy career On May 20, 2011 Captain Stefanyshyn-Piper became commander of the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Maryland.

While both sides in the Spanish Civil War attracted participants from Ireland, the majority sided with the Nationalist faction. Support for the Nationalists Feeling in Ireland in the 1930s ran overwhelmingly against the Second Spanish Republic due to the opposition by the Catholic Church. Following the July coup by the generals in Spain a wave of atrocities swept the country on both sides; in Republican Spain the Red Terror was, in part, directed against the Church there. Ireland was awash with atrocity stories, leading to proposals to form a crusade to protect the Church and fight against the left-wing Republic. In fact, these atrocities against the Catholic Church -including, convents and schools and student residences- had already begun back in 1931, soon after the inauguration of the 2nd Republic. (See \\"Quema de conventos 1931\\"). In Ireland the issue was presented in stark contrasts. Intermediate shades received little toleration. The Catholic church, arguably coming to the height of its conservatism, portrayed the war as a struggle between Christ and anti-Christ. Religion was under attack. Christian civilisation was mortally imperilled by the poison of communism. Innumerable sermons dinned home the dubious tenet that whatever opposed the onrush of communism was good. A joint pastoral of the Irish bishops firmly supported Franco. Encouraged by the Church hierarchy, Eoin O'Duffy, leader of the fascist NCP, started to recruit a brigade of Irish volunteers to fight in Spain in defence of the church. By late 1936 some 7,000 men had volunteered, of whom about 700 were selected, and in November 1936 these sailed to Spain, where they became the XV Bandera (battalion) of the Spanish Foreign Legion, or \\"Irish Brigade\\". However, the Brigade became something of a political football: Franco was at first keen to have it, as a way of cementing control over the Requetes, the catholic monarchist militia of Navarre, but once this was achieved the brigades presence was at odds with the Nationalists emphasis on \\"Spanishness\\". On the other hand, O'Duffy's purpose for the Brigade was not so much to support Spain as to enhance his own reputation in Ireland, and restore his political fortunes there. Militarily the Brigade achieved little; in its first action, near Ciempozuelos in February 1937, the Brigade was involved in a friendly fire incident with a Falangist unit while advancing to the front. Four brigaders and 13 Falangists were killed in the exchange of fire.Othen p117 Shortly after, at Titulcia in March 1937 the Brigade refused to advance after taking casualties and was withdrawn.Othen p119 Later, months of inactivity in a quiet sector sapped morale and saw an erosion of discipline; the unit was finally sent home in July 1937.Othen p160 Support for the Spanish Republic Support for the Spanish Republic was organized through various left wing organizations, though it was limited by the actions in Spain against the Catholic Church. Harry Midgley, the leader of the NILP, spoke out against Franco, but lost support amongst his constituents and in 1938 his seat in the Northern Ireland parliament because of this.Bardon, Jonathan, A History of Ulster, 199 In September 1936 a decision was made in Paris by the Third Communist International to form an International Brigade of volunteers to fight with the Republicans. Recruiting in Ireland was organised by the Communist Party of Ireland: Chief organizers of this effort were Sean Murray, Peadar O'Donnell, and Frank Ryan. In all 320 Irish men served with the International Brigades, a quarter of whom were killed in action. Some were involved with underground unions, some were opposed to O'Duffy's Blueshirts and Greenshirts in Ireland, while others believed that fascism threatened Ireland. One of those was Michael O'Riordan, the future head of the Communist Party of Ireland. O'Riordan took part in all the battles of the 15th International Brigade in support of the Spanish Republican Army, including the Battle of the Ebro, at which he was wounded. Michael-O'Riordan, Daily Telegraph (London) 27 May 2006. Retrieved 24 April 2016 In late 1936 Frank Ryan travelled to Spain with about 80 men to fight in the International Brigades on the Republican side. Ryan's men are sometimes referred to as the \\"Connolly Column\\".O'Riordan p55 As part of the XV International Brigade the Connollys fought in the battles of Jarama, Brunete and Belchite in 1937, and at Teruel, Gandesa and the Ebro in 1938. Ryan himself rose to the rank of Brigadier, was seriously wounded in March 1937 at Jarama, and was captured in March 1938 on the Ebro. He was tried and sentenced to death, though this was later commuted to thirty years hard labour in January 1940. As part of an international agreement, the Spanish republican government called upon the International Brigades to withdraw in 1938.O'Riordan p134 The Connollys returned to Ireland, where many were treated as pariahs for their efforts.‚ÄúIrish Involvement in the Spanish Civil War 1936-39‚Äù rte.ie.

Legacy Fearghal McGarry, writing for RT√â, has noted: \\"The Spanish Civil War is now remembered in Ireland as a conflict between democracy and fascism rather than Christianity and communism. As a result, the veterans of the International Brigades have gradually come to be regarded as heroes, while the Irish Brigade's crusaders have been forgotten or are reviled as supporters of fascism.

History  Ciudad Kennedy formed part of the land settled by Muisca probably as far back as the 6th century BC, and its historic name in Muysccubun is Techotyna. The Spanish, through the Spanish conquest of the Muisca of 1537, utilized this area for farms and cattle ranches. The 20th century brought further transformation, with urbanization starting in the 1930s. In 1948, Bavaria opened its main brewery in Kennedy. In 1961, an urbanization project was undertaken, financed in part by the Alianza para el Progreso (Alliance for Progress). The locality was known as Ciudad Techo until 1963, when the name was changed in honor of the assassinated John F. Kennedy, who visited Bogot√° in 1961 and supported the Alliance for Progress.

Primorac is the founder of the American-European School for Clinical and Forensic Genetics which is being held bi-annually in Croatia and co-founder of the International Society of Applied Biological Sciences. Moreover, for the years 2003, 2005, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 the U.S. Mayo Clinic, is actively participating in the work of this Congress as a co- organizer (until now about 5700 scientists from nearly 74 countries have participated in the work of the Congress.International Society for Applied Biological Sciences Since 2007 ISABS (International Society of Applied Biological Sciences) become the organizer of the Congress, whose official journal is Croatian Medical Journal.Croatian Medical Journal He authored close to 200 scientific papers and abstracts in clinical and molecular medicine, genetics, forensic science, population genetics, genetic legacy of Homo sapiens and education, science and technology policy. Currently, he has a particular interest in metabolic bone and cartilage disorders, sports medicine as well as in personalized and regenerative medicine. He is the author of the original results on the genetic origins of the Europeans with a special focus on the South Eastern European population. Several renowned media outlets, both electronic and print, have reported on the results of his research work, such as the New York Times, USA Today, Chicago Tribune, Hartford Courant, JAMA, Lancet, Science, NBC, Channel 8 (Connecticut TV Station), etc. Primorac worked at the Clinic for Pediatrics and served for several years (1996‚Äì2001) as the head of the Laboratory for Clinical and Forensic Genetics, both at Split Clinical Hospital. He was also director of the Polyclinic \\" Holy Spirit II \\" in Zagreb while currently, he is President of the Board of Trustees of the St. Catherine Hospital. During 1992/1993 Primorac and Simun Andelinovic founded the Laboratory for Clinical and Forensic Genetics at the Clinical Hospital in Split. That laboratory was the first in the region where identification of war victims discovered in mass graves by DNA technology took place. For their efforts, they won a joint Award of the City of Split in 1995. Primorac received 21 domestic and international awards including Mary E. Cowan Outstanding Service Award awarded by the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, The Young Investigator Award of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, the Michael Geisman Fellowship Award of the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation, the Life Time Achievement Award by the Henry C. Lee College of Criminal Justice and Forensic Sciences, The Award of the Italian Region Veneto for Special Achievements in Promoting Science in the EU, the University of New Haven‚Äôs International Award for Excellence, Presidential Award by the President of the International Association of Forensic Sciences for his contribution given to forensic sciences. In 2015 he has been awarded The State Science Award (the most prestigious national recognition by the Parliament of the Republic of Croatia) for his outstanding contribution to a biomedical science and received ‚ÄúThe Order of Croatian Star with the Effigy of Ruƒëer Bo≈°koviƒá‚Äú decoration, from the President of the Republic of Croatia for his extraordinary achievements in science. In June of 2018., the President of the Republic of Croatia awarded Primorac with the Order of Ante Starƒçeviƒá for his extraordinary achievements in the field of science, education, and politics, as well as for his contributions to the development of the Republic of Croatia.  Politics  Primorac became a politician as a member of Croatian Government, serving as the Minister of Science, Education and Sports between 2003 and 2009. He completed his first term (2003‚Äì2007) without any party affiliation. According to the International Republican Institute survey of October 1, 2007, he was rated as the most successful minister in the Croatian Government with 31% approval rate. Primorac was at first not a member of a political party, before he joined the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) in September 2007. At the Croatian parliamentary election, 2007, he ran as a candidate of HDZ in the 11th electoral unit (the so-called Croatian diaspora list), and their list won almost 82% of the votes. After elections he did not join the Parliament and was named a minister again in January 2008. Because of proposed reduction of the budget for the Ministry of education, science and sports, and especially due to the canceling the project of free textbooks and free transport for pupils of primary and secondary schools in Croatia he announced his resignation. He resigned on July 7, 2009. Soon after, he made an unprecedented move, and he gave up his seat in the Croatian parliament to the Party. The Party then gave the seat to Goran Maric, who replaced Primorac while he was minister. On November 9, 2009, Primorac formally announced his candidacy in the Croatian presidential election, 2009. He was subsequently summarily removed from HDZ membership. In the first round of the election he won 5.93% of the vote and did not qualify for the second round. Primorac entered the first government of Ivo Sanader in December 2003. Primorac's commitment to build a society based on knowledge and to acknowledge the key role of education and science has been reflected in a growing investment into the education and science system, with the budget increase between 2004 and 2009 totaling 56% (‚Ç¨ EUR 600,000,000). At the same time an additional (approx. ‚Ç¨600,000,000) have been approved and used for building University Campuses in Croatia. Within the education and science system, over 9,900 new jobs have been created since 2004 in order to ensure optimum implementation of reforms. All together it represents the biggest investment in the education and science sector as well as the largest creation of jobs in this sector in the recent history of Croatia In 2005, the Ministry of Education under Primorac started a project called the Croatian national education standard for elementary schools (\\"HNOS\\") which was supposed to be applied in all schools in 2006, but was applied during 2007. He also completed one of the most important projects during his term: Implementation of two foreign languages in Croatian primary schools. Primorac proposed the National Programme of Measures for the Implementation of Compulsory Secondary Education to Croatian Parliament, based on Article 80 Constitution of the Republic of Croatia. During its session on June 21, 2007, Parliament adopted the program as the optimal model to solve the problems of poor education structure of Croatian population, and the frequency of early school dropouts. Within the National Programme of Measures for the Implementation of Compulsory Secondary Education, a series of incentives, such as free textbooks, free transport and housing in student dormitories have been offered to make secondary education accessible to everyone. In 2006, Minister Primorac introduced the concept of free textbooks and announced that all pupils of elementary schools and pupils of the first class of secondary schools will have their schoolbooks funded by the Government. On May 12, 2009, Primorac announced that the Ministry reached a deal with the publishers of schoolbooks in Croatia so that the Government would pay for the schoolbooks of all classes (including second, third and fourth grades of secondary schools), for the sum of 440 million kunas, the same prices as the year before. During 2008 he introduced for the first time in Croatia, independent external evaluation of education ‚ÄúNational exams‚Äù, while in 2009, he launched the State Matura (national standard tests equal to SAT) for all students who are planning to continue their education in Universities.Nacionalni centar za vanjsko vrednovanje obrazovanja Under his leadership, the Ministry also applied the Bologna process in the academic year 2005/2006. Within the area of a science project for the return of Croatian scientists from abroad was started and since 2004 over 120 scientists have returned to Croatia. The programme Unity through Knowledge yielded approximately 40 competitive research projects with returnee and Diaspora (Croatian professionals working abroad) participation. On June 16, 2009, weekly magazine Nacional announced that ‚ÄúPrimorac will soon become the first minister in the history of Croatia to resign at the peak of his political career‚Äù. On July 1, 2009 he resigned together with Ivo Sanader, although the media had reported him planning to resign several weeks prior to the abrupt departure of Sanader. Primorac also gave back his Parliament seat to the party, and was replaced by Goran Mariƒá. In the newly formed government of Jadranka Kosor, he was replaced by his former state-secretary Radovan Fuchs, who reversed the Primorac‚Äôs free schoolbook policy in his first week in office. The award for numerous efforts made in the Croatian educational system is the survey of the famous Newsweek which rated Croatia 22nd in education ahead of 12 countries from the G20 group.Newsweek, The World's Best Countries infographic  Sport activities  While he was living in Split he was trained in soccer clubs NK Split, HNK Hajduk and NK Solin, as well as track and field in the athletic club ‚ÄúSplit 80‚Äù (today Hajduk). On November 17. 1987 he founded the Tae kwon do club ‚ÄúKocunar‚Äù and since then he is president of the club.Tae kwon do club \\"Koncunar\\" video Shortly thereafter, Robert Prusac, vice-president and Mile Mamic, second vice-president joined the club. Since 1987 more than 6000 participants have been trained in the Club, and many of them won a number of medals in national and international competitions. During the General Assembly of the European Olympic Committee (December 3-4, 2004.) he was awarded Silver medal for his contribution to sports. In 2015. Primorac was inducted into the Taekwondo Hall of Fame based in United Status. In 2020. he was awarded WTE Gold Medal by Mr. Sakis Pragalos, taekwondo Europe president.

Tennis career He started playing amateur tennis in the late 1920s by entering one of his first tournaments at the age of 17 in the 1926 edition of The French Covered Courts tournament in doubles, which he won by teaming up with French veteran Ren√© Lacoste. He was the runner-up at the Pacific South-west Championship in 1928(lost to fellow Frenchman Henri Cochet) although he won the mixed title trophy alongside American Anne Harper. The same year he won his first outdoor doubles title in D√ºsseldorf pairing Davis Cup teammate Jean Borotra. He won his first singles championships in 1929. He was on the victorious French team at the Davis Cup four times, in 1929, 1930, 1931, and 1932, although he never played. The members of the team became known as the \\"Four Musketeers\\" and Boussus was the \\"Fifth Musketeer\\". He finally got his chance to play at the Davis cup in 1934, when the Four Musketeers had retired. During World War II in 1941 in Vichy France, he won the unofficial French Open doubles title partnering Bernard Destremau, a feat that is unrecognized by the ITF. The same year he starred in a movie called \\"L'Appel du stade\\". After the war he became the captain of the French Davis Cup Team between 1949‚Äì1952 and vice-captain from 1953. In the very first year of his leadership France reached the final of the 1949 Davis Cup for the first time in 15 years. In club level team competitions he represented Racing Club de France of Paris. Christian Boussus (left) and Vivian McGrath (center) enter the center court of the White City Stadium in Sydney, Australia in November 1934 Boussus was defeated in the finals of the 1931 French Championships by Jean Borotra. In 1932, he and Marcel Bernard were defeated in the doubles finals of the French Championships by Henri Cochet and Jacques Brugnon. He played twice the Australian Championships, in 1928 and 1935, and won the mixed doubles that year, his only Grand Slam title. He competed in the French Championships 19 times between 1927 and 1953, which is the third most appearances in history right after Fabrice Santoro (20) and Francois Jauffret (20). Boussus twice won the German Championships in Hamburg (1930, 1931) and the British Hard Court Championships on one occasion (1931). He was ranked number one French tennis player four times in a row in the consecutive years of 1934, 1935, 1936 and 1937. Boussus was ranked World No. 9 in 1930 and 1935 by A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph, and the European No. 6 in 1931 (the latter by Z√ºricher Sport newspaper).\\"Moody, Perry Rated Tops By British Expert\\", Reading Eagle, 17 October 1935. Playing style At the peak of his career in 1932 his play was observed by Great Britain's then active Davis Cup player Nigel Sharpe who described him as the greatest French left-hander in the following manner: \\"He relies upon an all-round game with volleying as his forte. There is nothing of hurricane speed in his game. He takes the ball on the rise and hist his forehand with an easy swing and without much topspin. He gets good pace in this stroke and usually relies upon it as the forerunner of a volleying campaign[‚Ä¶]His backhand is of the cut variety but although putting so much slice on it he does not let it stop him from hitting it pretty hard. This stroke, of course, has its limitations, as it is distinctly difficult to make good passing shots against an agile volleyer. This wing is Boussus' chief weakness[‚Ä¶] (he) is able to make his volley down the line with great speed...but does not use his wrist quite so much\\". He further analysed his service game and found it be most unorthodox. Boussus completely omitted to swing his racquet behind his head while serving making his serves rather ineffective. Although this style was useful in overhead smashes when accuracy is more important than the speed. With this type of serve he also put a great spin to the ball and kept it relatively low. Later in his career he adapted to baseline play and utilized a series of dropshots in his games. Personal life In his student ages he studied advertising. His 1930 season was interrupted because he had to fulfill his military service. While playing amateur tennis, he worked as a tire salesman in the meantime. Later he was appointed the director of communications for IBM France. Apart from his tennis playing style, he is known as the first man to wear shorts instead of pants on court. He was in a civil partnership with French parfume designer Germaine Cellier with whom he lived together for 30 years until she died in 1976. He died at the age of 95, the last surviving Musketeer. He had a brother Roland, also amateur tennis player, with whom he won the doubles title of the Le Touquet Spa Championships in 1937, while also winning the singles and mixed contest as well.

Myers (December 29, 1832 ‚Äì March 5, 1909) was a leading architect of government buildings in the latter half of the 19th century, and the only architect to design the capitol buildings of three U.S. states, the Michigan State Capitol, the Texas State Capitol, and the Colorado State Capitol. He also designed buildings in Mexico and Brazil. Myers' designs favored Victorian Gothic and Neo-Classical styles, but he worked in other styles as well.  Biography He was born on December 29, 1832 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the second largest city in the country, at the time. Historians suggest Myers may have studied architecture under Samuel Sloan before serving in the Civil War. On March 24, 1860 Myers married Mary Haines, the daughter of a prominent businessman, John Haines. The Myers family raised five children. In 1863, Elijah and Mary decided to move westward, settling in Springfield, Illinois where they lived for nine years. In 1872 they moved to Detroit, Michigan while Myers was working on the Michigan State Capitol, where they remained. In 1881, he won the competition for the best design for the new Texas capitol in Austin. He was paid $12,000 USD ($289,000 in 2018) to be the project's architect, and the capitol cost $3,700,000 USD to build. Other examples of his work are the parliament buildings in Rio de Janeiro, the asylum building in Mexico City, as well as multiple courthouses, churches, hospitals, and city halls throughout the United States. Myers had conflicts with fellow architects, whom he claimed stole his designs and sued, and sometimes his clients. He was fired from the Texas Capitol project in 1886 over complaints that he was not giving enough attention to the project, and his design was subsequently changed. He was also fired from the Colorado State Capitol project and the Howell Library project, apparently in disputes about money. In 1879, Myers sued Edwin May, the architect of a new Indiana State House, claiming that elements of design were stolen. Myers lost the lawsuit. In 1891, Myers applied for the position of Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury but another was chosen. During the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, Myers served on the Board of Examiners for the fair's buildings. Myers died at home in Detroit, Michigan on March 5, 1909. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery, Detroit. His grave is currently unmarked but an Elijah Myers Memorial Commission is raising funds for an appropriate stone. The day following his death, his obituary was shown in the New York Times. The only known portrait of Myers hangs in the Elijah Myers room of the Michigan State Capitol. Legacy  On January 5, 1914, the Supreme Court decided , in Myers' favor. The cases was a business dispute between Myers and his attorney, George W. Radford, involving litigation about the unbuilt Luzerne County Courthouse.

He was first cousin to Empress K≈çjun (Nagako), the wife of Emperor Sh≈çwa (Hirohito). Early life Prince Kaya Tsunenori was born in Tokyo, the first son of Prince Kaya Kuninori and his wife, the former Daig≈ç Yoshiko. He received his primary and secondary education at the boys' department of the Gakushuin Peers‚Äô School. On December 8, 1909, he became the second head of the Kaya-no-miya house upon his father's death. Military career Like the other imperial princes of his generation, Prince Kaya was a career military officer. In 1920, after serving a term in the House of Peers, he graduated from the 32nd class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and received a commission as a lieutenant (2nd class) in the cavalry. In August 1925, he became commander of the Tenth Cavalry Regiment (at the rank of captain) and graduated from the 38th class of Army Staff College. The following year, he rose to the rank of major in the cavalry, and was appointed an instructor at the Army Staff College the following year. He joined the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff in 1933 and was promoted to colonel two years later. Prince and Princess Kaya undertook a seven-month world tour in 1934, visiting the United States, Great Britain, France, and Germany. The tour received extensive press coverage at the time. After his return to Japan, he replaced his uncle, Prince Asaka Yasuhiko, as the emperor's personal envoy to Nanking, the occupied capital of Nationalist China, following the Nanjing Massacre in January 1938. He was promoted to major general in 1940 and lieutenant general in 1943 in command of the IJA 43rd Division. Prince Kaya became commander of the Third Imperial Guard Division in 1944 and briefly served as president of the Army Staff College during the closing stages of World War II. Commoner life After October 14, 1947, Prince Kaya Tsunenori and his family were divested of their imperial status and become commoners due to the American occupation authorities' reform of the Japanese imperial household. Barred from holding public office because of his military career, the former prince received a lump payment from the reconstituted Imperial Household Council in order to \\"maintain his dignity.\\" The former prince later served on the boards of directors of the Taish≈ç Life Insurance Company and Nissan Mutual Life Insurance Company. He served as the honorary president of the International Martial Arts Federation from its founding in 1953 until 1965. The former prince was a noted fan and supporter of Japanese baseball. In 1970, he founded a retirement home in Nagano Prefecture. The former prince died of a heart ailment on January 2, 1978 at his home in Chiba Prefecture. The former Kaya-no-miya palace is now the site of the Chidorigafuchi National Cemetery in downtown Tokyo. Marriage and family On May 3, 1921, Prince Kaya married Kuj≈ç Toshiko (May 16, 1903 ‚Äì March 23, 1993), the third daughter of Prince Kuj≈ç Michizane, head of one of the Five regent houses of the Fujiwara clan. His wife was also a niece of Empress Teimei, the consort of the Emperor Taish≈ç.

The Action Pack included two hours of various television series produced by Renaissance Pictures and distributed by MCA TV (later known as Universal Television Enterprises and Studios USA Television Distribution). Background Previously, there were three attempts by MCA TV/Universal Television to launch some sort of organized independent programming. First, MCA TV launched the ad-hoc movie Universal Pictures Debut Network in 1985. With Premier Program Service, MCA TV teamed up with Paramount for this planned network by October 1989 which was abandoned in February 1990. The last was a two night three-series Hollywood Premiere Network in 1990-91. History In 1994, the Action Pack initially ran as a Wheel series of television movies, which were all effective pilots as if successful they would then become TV series in the following season.Mysteries Surrounding the Creation of the Syndicated Television Show XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS Whoosh Online Edition. Issue Three. November 1996. The initial plan was for 4 films created from 6 franchises for the block including TekWar, Smokey and the Bandit, Midnight Run, Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Vanishing Son and the working title Fastlane when offered at programming executive conference in January 1994. On January 17 and 18, 1994, a dozen stations showed TekWar, the premiere TV movie of the programming block. The stations' ratings increased greatly with a 350% increase in KOFY in San Francisco. MCA cut Rob Cohen's Midnight Run to three films, so that star Christopher McDonald could star in a feature film. Cohen produced Knight Rider 2010 as a replacement. The block aired its first season until January 1995 and lost $30 million. TekWar was picked up as a regular TV series for the USA Network instead of Action Pack, starting in January 1995. From January to June 1995, the series included Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Vanishing Son with the Hercules series, becoming a surprise hit as the third most watched first-run syndicated action hour. From September 1995 through January 2000, it included the Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and its spinoff, Xena: Warrior Princess.Bevis King's Xena: Warrior Princess website After Hercules ended its run in January 2000, the Universal Action Pack launched the Back2Back Action Hour consisting of two thirty-minute series: Jack of All Trades and Cleopatra 2525 to air alongside Xena. The lineup lasted until second quarter 2001. Jack of All Trades and Xena were canceled and Cleopatra 2525 was increased to an hour long show in January 2001. After Xena, the most successful series on the Action Pack, completed airing its final season's reruns in the summer of 2001, Cleopatra 2525 also stopped production and the Action Pack block was discontinued. Television movies The television movies aired during the Action Pack's first year included: Hercules series: *Hercules and the Amazon Women *Hercules and the Lost Kingdom *Hercules and the Circle of Fire *Hercules in the Underworld *Hercules in the Maze of the Minotaur TekWar (Based on the books by William Shatner): *Tekwar *TekLords *Teklab *TekJustice, an original story The Midnight Run Action Pack, Midnight Run films (Spin-offs of the 1988 Robert De Niro film): *Another Midnight Run *Midnight Runaround *Midnight Run for Your Life Bandit films (Spin-offs of the Smokey and the Bandit films): *Bandit Goes Country *Bandit Bandit *Beauty and the Bandit *Bandit's Silver Angel Vanishing Son films: *Vanishing Son *Vanishing Son II *Vanishing Son III *Vanishing Son IV Starting as a series of four made for television movies in 1994, the series debuted on January 16, 1995. Vanishing Son I, Vanishing Son II, Vanishing Son III, and Vanishing Son IV, were aired on February 28, July 18, July 25, and October 10, 1994, respectively. The series was ground-breaking for the casting of an Asian male in an attractive leading-man role. An additional movie was a part of the initial lineup, titled Fastlane was set to be directed by John Landis and would concern two friends finding a spaceship/car hybrid vehicle. However, for unknown reasons the project never actually made it to air. The \\"shell\\" prop for the spaceship/car (which was designed to fit over a Pontiac Fiero) was auctioned off in 2007. *Knight Rider 2010 (1994) *The Adventures of Captain Zoom (December 9, 1995) * Beastmaster III: The Eye of Braxus (May 24th, 1996) * Atlantis: The Lost Continent, first shown on a Starz/Encore network channel in March 1997 before being run on Action Pack as a pilot TV film in August 1997.

Born in Virginia Colony, Sumner's military service began in the French and Indian War as a member of the state's Provincial forces. After the conclusion of that conflict, he moved to Bute County, Province of North Carolina where he acquired a substantial area of land and operated a tavern. He served as Sheriff of Bute County, but with the coming of the American Revolution, he became a strident Patriot, and was elected to North Carolina's Provincial Congress. Sumner was named the commanding officer of the 3rd North Carolina Regiment of the North Carolina Line, a formation of the Continental Army, in 1776, and served in both the Southern theater and Philadelphia campaign. He was one of five brigadier generals from North Carolina in the Continental Army, in which capacity he served between 1779 and 1783. He served with distinction in the battles of Stono Ferry and Eutaw Springs, but recurring bouts of poor health often forced him to play an administrative role, or to convalesce in North Carolina. Following a drastic reduction in the number of North Carolinians serving with the Continental Army, Sumner became a general in the state's militia but resigned in protest after the North Carolina Board of War awarded overall command of the militia to William Smallwood, a Continental Army general from Maryland. After the end of the war in 1783, Sumner helped to establish the North Carolina Chapter of the Society of the Cincinnati, and became its first president. He died in 1785 with extensive landholdings and 35 slaves. Early life alt=A map showing the general layout of rivers, homes, and settlements in Bute County, North Carolina Sumner was born in Nansemond County, Virginia, in 1733 to Jethro and Margaret Sullivan Sumner. His family had originally settled in Nansemond County in 1691. Between 1758 and 1761, during the French and Indian War, he was a lieutenant in the Virginia Provincial forces in Pennsylvania under the command of William Byrd III. On November 25, 1758, Sumner participated in the capture of Fort Duquesne. He was made commander at Pennsylvania's Fort Bedford in 1760. After his regiment was disbanded in 1761, he returned home to Nansemond County. Between 1761 and 1764, he moved to Bute County in North Carolina, and married Mary Hurst of Granville County, with whom he would have three children. One daughter, Mary, went on to wed Thomas Blount, who would later serve multiple terms in the United States House of Representatives. Sumner owned substantial property inherited through his wife's family in Bute County, where he also owned and possibly operated a tavern on land that he leased for ¬£36 annually. Like many former Virginians who moved across the border into North Carolina during the colonial era, it is likely that Sumner would have retained close business ties with the province of his birth. Between 1772 and 1776, he served as sheriff of Bute County, resigning when he became an officer during the American Revolutionary War. Sumner was active in pre-Revolution protests and politics, as he believed a separation from Great Britain was inevitable. American Revolutionary War In 1775, the North Carolina Provincial Congress passed legislation to raise militia forces throughout the state, and to that end it organized six militia districts, including one, centered on the town of Halifax, which contained Sumner's home. The soldiers comprising the militia throughout the state were to enlist for six-month periods. Sumner was chosen to be a major in the Halifax District militia, and was instructed to drill his men so that they would be prepared for the expected conflict. Between August and September 1775, he served as Bute County's representative at the Third North Provincial Congress. In November 1775, Sumner summoned his militia into active service, and marched north to join Robert Howe in capturing (and later burning) Norfolk, Virginia. Southern theater, 1776 On April 4, 1776, after the American Revolutionary war had been raging in Massachusetts for nearly a year, the Provincial Congress at Halifax chose Sumner to be colonel, and thus commanding officer, of the 3rd North Carolina Regiment. He likely participated in the defense of Charleston against a British invasion attempt in 1776, after which he was involved in the aborted plans of Major General Charles Lee to invade British Florida. During the planning stages for the Florida invasion, Sumner disagreed with Peter Muhlenberg of the 8th Virginia Regiment over which of the two was to be given command over Lee's Virginia and North Carolina troops while the commanding general was traveling in advance of his men. This dispute was resolved only when a military court of inquiry awarded Muhlenberg temporary command after Sumner failed to appear and plead his case. By August 18, 1776, Sumner's 3rd Regiment had reached Savannah, Georgia, where they joined Lee, who had arrived earlier in the month. The planned invasion of Florida did not materialize, though, and Sumner left his regiment at Savannah in September 1776 to recruit more soldiers from North Carolina. Philadelphia campaign and Valley Forge In early 1777, Sumner resumed command of the 3rd North Carolina regiment, and marched the unit north to serve under George Washington in the Philadelphia campaign. In early and mid-1777, he remained encamped with the main portion of the Continental Army at Morristown, New Jersey. He and his men drilled regularly and had their supplies and arms inspected and repaired, although many of the North Carolinians had such poor muskets that a substantial number were discarded. Sumner and his regiment fought in the battles of Brandywine and Germantown, and spent the winter of 1777 to 1778 in Valley Forge with Washington's army. After the death at Germantown of General Francis Nash, the regiments of his North Carolina brigade were left without a commanding general. Generals Alexander McDougall of New York and Lachlan McIntosh of Georgia were appointed in succession to temporary command of the North Carolinians while in winter quarters. Many North Carolina officers believed the state was due the appointment of two additional brigadier generals based on the number of soldiers it provided to the Continental Army. At Valley Forge, the North Carolina brigade had a total strength of 1,051, but 353 were ill, and 164 lacked sufficient clothes to be fit for service. Sumner himself became ill in early 1778, and was forced to return home to recuperate; he continued to recruit soldiers in North Carolina during his recovery. Despite his recruitment efforts, in February 1778, North Carolina's regiments were consolidated because of a lack of available soldiers, and Sumner's 3rd Regiment absorbed the 5th North Carolina Regiment. Promotion and campaigning in the Carolinas Although North Carolina believed it was owed additional general officer positions, conflicts between members of the North Carolina General Assembly over who was to be considered for the positions stalled the appointment of officers to assume those positions. Thomas Burke, one of North Carolina's leading delegates to the Continental Congress, apparently lacked interest in any of the suggested candidates. To complicate matters further, Alexander Martin, once a leading candidate for generalship, resigned after charges of cowardice were leveled against him, and was no longer seen as an appropriate candidate. The General Assembly deferred discussion of possible replacement generals for more than a month after convening on November 7, 1777. By December 15, the North Carolina General Assembly instructed its representatives in the Second Continental Congress to nominate Sumner for promotion to general. It was not until January 9, 1779, though, that the Continental Congress commissioned Sumner as brigadier general (along with fellow North Carolinian James Hogun), and ordered him to join General Benjamin Lincoln in South Carolina. Sumner received the highest number of congressional votes, thirteen to Hogun's nine and Thomas Clark's four. On June 20, 1779, Sumner led a Continental Army brigade at the Battle of Stono Ferry, assaulting the British right flank and routing the Hessian von Tr√ºmbach Regiment. The Continentals and the Patriot militia began to run out of ammunition during the battle, and Lincoln was forced to order a general retreat. At least seven Continental officers under Sumner's command were wounded, and future United States President Andrew Jackson's brother Hugh was among ten North Carolinians killed. After the engagement at Stono Ferry, Sumner experienced another bout of poor health. He returned to North Carolina to recover, continuing to recruit troops during his convalescence. He suffered financially during his recovery, as a monetary crisis at the time left many officers in his position barely able to support themselves at home. He was also tasked by Lincoln with finding deserters in North Carolina and pressing them back into service. Sumner was on a leave of absence in September and October 1779, during the Patriot defeat at the Siege of Savannah. Militia command alt=An image of Nathanael Greene standing beside his horse, dressed in the uniform of a Continental Army General Between the Siege of Charleston in May 1780 and the Battle of Camden in August that year, the North Carolina Line (a loose organizational structure that encompassed all of North Carolina's Continental Army units) was virtually annihilated, suffering substantial casualties and the loss of many men as prisoners of war. During at least part of the intervening time, Sumner was in North Carolina on a recruiting mission. Rather than rebuild the Line, the North Carolina General Assembly determined to rely on militia for the defense of the state. In September 1780, Sumner temporarily transferred to command of the Hillsborough District Brigade, under the statewide leadership of Richard Caswell. As commander of a brigade of North Carolina militia, Sumner was tasked with defending the state from the advances of British General Charles Cornwallis, but the militiamen were poorly equipped and ill-trained. In late 1780, the North Carolina Board of War removed Caswell from command of North Carolina's militia, and the General Assembly awarded command of the militia to Continental Army Brigadier General William Smallwood of Maryland, citing the Assembly's lack of confidence in their own state's military commanders. Sumner was further offended when command of the dwindling number of North Carolina Continentals in the southern theater was given to Smallwood as well. Despite persistent urging from Alexander Martin and others, Sumner resigned from his militia command in October 1780, and returned to the Continental service. A political backlash by prominent militia commanders like Caswell and Martin and their supporters led to the abolition of the Board of War by the General Assembly soon after Sumner's resignation, and Caswell in particular came back to power on the Board's replacement organ, called the \\"Council Extraordinary\\". Return to the Continental Army Sumner next served under General Nathanael Greene, who arrived in the southern theater in December 1780 and directed Sumner to recruit further Continental soldiers from North Carolina. On June 2, 1781, Greene ordered Sumner to join him in South Carolina, which he did along with 350 new recruits on August 1. Despite the passage of a draft law in North Carolina, the number of men under his command fluctuated from day to day because of both temporary and permanent desertions. These desertions eventually elicited his personal apology to Greene, as Sumner felt unable to control the ebb of soldiers in camp. On September 8, his regiments were positioned on the right flank of the Continental Army at the Battle of Eutaw Springs, where his units served a vital role in halting several British assaults. Greene commented on the North Carolinians' actions at Eutaw Springs, stating that they \\"fought with a degree of obstinacy that would do honor to the best of veterans\\". Following his success at Eutaw Springs, Sumner was made commanding officer of Continental Army forces in North Carolina by Greene in 1781. Greene primarily wanted him to regain control of the military situation in the state, as then-Governor and former Continental Congress delegate Thomas Burke had been captured by David Fanning in a stunning daylight raid on Hillsborough, North Carolina on September 12, 1781. Combat between the British and Continental armies effectively ceased in late 1781. After that point, Sumner failed to make any reports to Greene, who remained his commanding officer, for several months at a time, partly because of Sumner's recurring bouts of illness. Post-war activities, death, and legacy alt=A black and white picture of a cube monument topped by a pyramid, both of stone, containing Sumner's remains alt=a letter naming three men as delegates from the North Carolina Society of the Cincinnati to a National Meeting in May 1784 with Sumner's signature at the bottom Following the war's end in 1783, Sumner returned to Bute County, which had been renamed Warren County after Joseph Warren, the hero of the Battle of Bunker Hill. It appears that Sumner's wife died at some point between 1781 and 1785. For his service in the Continental Army, he received a land warrant on October 23, 1783, which represented compensation for 84 months of service. Sumner helped create North Carolina's chapter of the Society of the Cincinnati in October 1783, and served as its first president. Sumner died in Warren County between March 15 and March 19, 1785, at the age of 52. At his death, he owned of land in North Carolina and Tennessee (much of which in the latter was part of the Continental Army land warrant he received), as well as 35 slaves. He was originally buried outside of Warrenton, but in 1891 his remains were moved to the Guilford Courthouse Battlefield, where they were interred under a monument intended as part of a \\"shrine to patriots\\". In March 2012, a driver struck Sumner's monument after going off-road to avoid hitting a deer, nearly destroying the stone structure. The monument was restored by May 2012, and Sumner was reburied in a public ceremony. Sumner County, Tennessee, originally in the western portion of North Carolina, was named for him, although Sumner never visited the county.

A mixed-use, primarily residential development, it is the tallest residential building in San Francisco. The blue-gray glass, late- modernist buildings are bounded by Mission, Fremont, and Beale Streets, and the north end of the Transbay Transit Center site. Opened to residents on April 23, 2009, 301 Mission includes two buildings: a 12-story tower located on the northeast of the property, and Millennium Tower, a 58-story, condominium skyscraper. In total, the project has 419 residential units, with 53 of those units in the smaller tower. The tower's highest level, 58 floors above the ground, is listed as the 60th, because floors 13 and 44 are missing for superstitious reasons. The French restaurant and wine bar International Smoke is housed on the ground floor of the skyscraper. Resident services include a private concierge and access to the Owner's Club Level, which features amenities such as a private lounge, wine cellar, and fitness center. The development's \\"lifestyle\\" program organizes cultural events. In May 2016, residents were informed the main tower was both sinking and tilting, resulting in several lawsuits concerning repair costs and whether the tilt had been withheld from buyers. Description Developed by Mission Street Development LLC, an affiliate of Millennium Partners, the project was designed by Handel Architects, engineered by DeSimone Consulting Engineers and constructed by Webcor Builders. At , it is the tallest concrete structure in San Francisco, the fourth tallest building in San Francisco overall, and the tallest since 345 California Street in 1986. It was also the tallest residential building west of the Mississippi River when finished (later surpassed by The Austonian in Texas). The tower is slender, with each floor containing of floor space. In addition to the 58-story tower, there is a , 11-story tower on the northeast end of the complex. Between the two towers is a , two-story glass atrium. In total, the project has 419 units. The residences are pricey; a penthouse unit sold for US$13 million in December 2016. The bottom 25 floors of the main tower are called Residences while the floors from 26 to the top have the name Grand Residences. (As is common in many high-rises, there is no thirteenth floor because of superstitions about triskaidekaphobia. Neither is there a forty-fourth floor, because the number four is considered unlucky by many Asians.Claus, Kyle Scott. \\"The Millennium Tower Has No 44th Floor Because of an Asian Superstition.\\" Boston magazine, 8 Feb. 2016. Retrieved 6 Aug. 2018.) The 53 units in the separate 12-story tower are called the City Residences. Below street level, there are 434 parking spaces in a five-level subterranean garage located under the 11-story tower. The building is located next to the site of the Transbay Transit Center. Overall, the tower's design is intended to resemble a translucent crystal, and is a landmark for the Transbay Redevelopment and the southern skyline of San Francisco. The development is also home to International Smoke, a restaurant and bar under the direction of Ayesha Curry and Chef Michael Mina, located on the ground floor of the skyscraper.\\"Rare peek into S.F.‚Äôs ultra-luxe Millennium Tower corner unit\\", Anna Marie Erwert, SFGate, September 24, 2015 History The Millennium Tower in August 2016 Millennium Partners first proposed the development in 2002 with 163 condominiums, 108 rentals and a 136-unit \\"extended stay\\" hotel. The project was approved in 2003 by the S.F. Planning Commission 4‚Äì1 and construction began in 2005. The only vote against the project came from Planning Commissioner Sue Lee. The development was the first high rise built downtown in 20 years. According to Modern Luxury, a proposed 52-story skyscraper at nearby 80 Natoma by developer Jack Myers which would also have a similar cast in place concrete construction, was rejected by the city's Department of Building Inspections (DBI) after an outside peer review. The Millennium Tower received no such scrutiny, since Millennium Partners would not submit to a peer review, as that study would have potentially delayed construction by years. Treadwell & Rollo, the geotechnical engineer for Millennium Tower, were also the geotechnical engineer for the scrapped project at 80 Natoma. On September 6, 2010, Dan Goodwin, also known as SpiderDan and Skyscraperman, scaled the outside of the tower using suction cups. Following the climb, Goodwin was arrested by the San Francisco police, who charged him with trespassing and creating a public nuisance. In 2013, the building sold its final unit, generating US$750 million in total sales, a 25 percent return on the estimated US$600 million in development costs. Sinking and tilting problem Discovery TTC construction next to the tower After developers apparently disclosed in 2015 that the building was sinking and tilting, the public was notified of the problem in 2016. Treadwell & Rollo's geotechnical design for the foundation of the main tower consists of a concrete slab built on concrete friction piles through the fill and young bay mud, and embedded into dense Colma sand. A number of other buildings in 301 Mission Street‚Äôs area have used similar systems, although due to varying earth conditions, others have pushed piles directly into the bedrock below. An examination in 2016 showed the building had sunk with a tilt at the base and an approximate tilt at the top of the tower. The building is leaning toward the northwest, and has caused cracks in the building's basement and the pavement surrounding the tower. As of 2018, the sinking has increased to 18 inches with a lean of 14 inches. The developer blames the sinking problem on the Transbay Joint Powers Authority (TJPA), who were responsible for construction of the neighboring Transbay Transit Center (TTC). However, the sinking problem had reportedly started before TTC construction even broke ground, and TJPA asserted the building had already settled , well past the original maximum vertical settling prediction of in 20 years, by the time TJPA began removing the timber piles under the prior Transbay Terminal in 2011. The building's homeowners association, represented by general counsel Adrian Adams of Adams Stirling PLC, retained Dan Petrocelli of O‚ÄôMelveny & Myers, to sue Webcor, Millennium Partners, and the TJPA.Dorsey, Matt. ‚ÄúMillennium Tower Homeowners Tap Petrocelli as Lead Counsel, Rounding Out All-Star Legal Team Prior to Lawsuit‚Äù, ‚Äò‚ÄôO‚ÄôMelveny & Meyers Press Release‚Äô‚Äô, San Francisco, February 7, 2017. Retrieved August 18, 2017. Originally, the homeowners association had hired David Casselman to sue the TJPA instead of developer Millennium Partners, as Casselman noted that \\"inverse condemnation law allows residents to collect legal fees on top of any award, whereas suing the developer will steer up to 40 percent of any award to lawyers\\". Another group of tenants who disagree with the homeowners association, led by resident and patent litigator Jerry Dodson, is suing Millennium Partners, the City of San Francisco, and the TJPA. In breaking with Casselman and the homeowners association, Dodson has regarded Millennium Partners as the responsible culprit. In November 2016, the city of San Francisco filed suit against the tower's developer Mission Street Developers LLC, claiming that the developers withheld information on the sinking problems from potential apartment buyers. Mission Street Developers rejected the city's claims. Sage Engineers has been hired by Millennium Partners to provide an engineering study on the sinking problem. Some experts have prognosticated that the cost to fix the tilt could exceed the liability insurance held by Millennium Partners and the building's various construction vendors. If the TJPA is found to be at fault, San Francisco taxpayers could end up paying for the repairs. , a city inspection has found that the building is still safe to occupy, though there has been damage to the foundation and electrical system. In March 2017, the homeowners association filed suit against Millennium Partners, Webcor, Handel Architects, Treadwell & Rollo, DeSimone Consulting Engineers, Arup, and Transbay Joint Powers Authority. They are seeking $200 million to cover repairs and damages. In early September 2018, residents reported hearing various \\"creaking sounds\\". At around 2:30 a.m. on the morning of Saturday, September 8, 2018, residents reported hearing a loud \\"popping sound\\". On Sunday, the following day, a resident located in a corner unit on the 36th floor discovered a cracked window. The glass used in the building's windows and facade is rated to withstand hurricane force winds, leading to concern that the crack was a symptom of a much larger structural failure.Millennium Tower window crack could signal bigger problem, report says. San Francisco Chronicle, September 7, 2018 Underpinning Millennium Tower On December 4, 2018, Ronald Hamburger, the senior principal engineer at Simpson Gumpertz & Heger, revealed in a press release on a final resolution to the Millennium Tower's tilting and sinking problem by underpinning the building. The solution will involve the installation of 52 piles along the north and west sides of the tower beneath the sidewalk that reach down 250 ft (76.2 m) into the bedrock of downtown San Francisco and be tied with the original 60‚Äì90 ft (18.3‚Äì27.4 m) deep foundation piles. It is estimated that about 50% of the tilt will be evened out over a period of 10 years as the south and eastern sides of the building come back into re-alignment with the now sunken north and western sides of the building, at which point the remaining south and eastern sides of the building will be anchored to the bedrock, permanently resolving the tilting and sinking of the building. The fix will cost about $100 million. The lawsuits are being consolidated into a global agreement and work is expected to start in mid- November of 2020.

Aloysius Stanislaus Travers (May 7, 1892 ‚Äì April 19, 1968) was a Major League Baseball pitcher who made a one-game appearance during the 1912 strike of the Detroit Tigers. He is the only Catholic priest to have played major league baseball. Travers was only playing because the Detroit Tigers team had refused to play after their teammate Ty Cobb had been suspended for attacking a heckler who called him a \\"half-nigger\\" during a game against the New York Yankees at Hilltop Park three days earlier. Travers does not, as is often reported, hold the major league record for most hits or runs allowed in a game, although he does hold the major league record for earned runs in a single major league game. The Cleveland Blues' Dave Rowe, who was primarily an outfielder, gave up 35 runs (12 earned) on 29 hits in a game played on July 24, 1882. Travers does hold the two negative records for American League play. Career On May 15, Cobb had entered the stands at the end of the sixth inning after being taunted with racist abuse from a heckler. Claude Lueker, who due to an industrial accident had lost one complete hand and only had three fingers on the other, had repeatedly called Cobb 'a half nigger'. When Cobb began beating him, fans pleaded with him to stop hitting a man with no hands. But Cobb reportedly shouted back, \\"I don't care if he has no feet!\\". American League president Ban Johnson, who was attending the game, responded by suspending Cobb indefinitely. Cobb's teammates voted to strike in support, refusing to play until he was reinstated. When Johnson threatened Tigers owner Frank Navin with a $5,000 fine for every game in which they failed to field a team, Navin ordered manager Hughie Jennings to find replacement players. As the Tigers were on the road in Philadelphia to play the Athletics, Jennings recruited eight \\"Tigers\\" from a neighborhood in North Philadelphia. Each man was paid $25; Travers took on the role of pitcher upon learning that the position would pay $50. Detroit Tigers Jennings found Allan Travers on a city street corner. The 20-year-old junior from Philadelphia's St. Joseph's College was a violinist in the student orchestra, but had never pitched a game in his life. He had even been unable to make the school's varsity baseball team. Instead, Travers served as the team's assistant manager, preparing game summaries for the school annual. Yet on May 18, 1912, Travers became a starting pitcher in a major league baseball game, walking out onto the mound in front of 15,000 Philadelphia fans at Shibe Park to face the two-time defending World Series champions. Over the next few hours Travers pitched to some of the best players of the era, including Frank \\"Home Run\\" Baker, Eddie Collins, and Stuffy McInnis. Under these unlikely circumstances, Travers pitched the sport's most unlikely complete game, allowing 26 hits, 24 runs, 14 earned runs, 7 walks and one strikeout. Travers faced 50 batters through 8 innings, and was tagged with the loss in the 24‚Äì2 decision. After the embarrassing display, Johnson met personally with the striking Tigers and told them they would be banned for life if the strike continued. Ty Cobb urged his teammates to end the strike, and the Tigers complied. Accordingly, the major league career of Allan Travers and all but one of the other replacement Tigers was cut short at one game. The lone exception was Billy Maharg, who later played in one game for the 1916 Philadelphia Phillies, but is best known for his off-the-field involvement in the 1919 Black Sox Scandal. Additionally, Tigers manager Hughie Jennings (age 43) and coaches Joe Sugden (age 41) and Deacon McGuire (age 48), each of whom previously had long and distinguished careers as players, played in the game for the Tigers. For all three men, it was their only playing appearance of the 1912 season. Jennings would play in only one more major league game, in 1918. It was the final game of both Sugden's and McGuire's careers. The unplanned appearance raised McGuire's career total to 26 Major League seasons, a record which would not be surpassed until 1993, by Nolan Ryan. McGuire (who became the last player born during the Civil War to appear in a big-league game) also recorded two fielding assists in the game, for a career total of 1,859, which remains the all-time record for catchers. Travers (0‚Äì1) never played again in the major leagues, preserving his career ERA at 15.75 and career WHIP at 4.13. Later life and death For years, Travers was reluctant to speak about his day as a major league ball player. But many years later, he told his story in an interview with sportswriter Red Smith. He recalled being asked to round up \\"as many fellows as I could find\\" to play for the Tigers. Travers claims to have gone to the corner of 23rd and Columbia in Philadelphia where \\"a bunch of fellows were standing around the corner.\\" That \\"bunch of fellows\\" became the Detroit Tigers for a day. When asked about his performance on the mound, Travers told Red Smith that he threw \\"slow curves\\" that day, because the A's were not used to them, and because manager Hughie Jennings told Travers not to throw any fastballs as he \\"was afraid I might get killed.\\" Travers later entered the Society of Jesus, also known as the Jesuits, and was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1926. He is the only priest to have played major league baseball. Travers taught at St. Francis Xavier High School in Manhattan and was later named Dean of Men at St. Joseph College. From 1943 to 1968, he taught Spanish and religion at Saint Joseph's Preparatory School in Philadelphia. Travers lived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for almost all of his life. He died at Misericordia Hospital in 1968 at age 75.

He attended King Edward's School, Birmingham where he played alongside Anurag Singh, in the year group team two years above his own (one year above Singh's). Having originally played first-class cricket for Oxford University, captaining them in 1997 and playing against opposing captain and friend Anurag Singh in the annual Varsity Match (cricket), he made his debut for Warwickshire in the same year. He received his county cap in 2000, and was selected for the England A tour of Australia in 2001 after hitting a massive 315 at Lord's in the county season. However, whilst fellow Academy member and teammate Ian Bell has gone on to an extended England career, Wagh has not since been called up, barring an inclusion in a preliminary squad for the ICC Champions Trophy in 2004. Whilst Wagh is principally considered a batsman and opened for Warwickshire in first- class and limited overs cricket, he is also a useful off-spinner, with career best figures of 7-222 against Lancashire in 2003. This followed a ban in 2000 after his action was reported for throwing. Since then, he has more than once closed out close games for the club with his bowling. Having missed the whole of the 2005 season after a serious knee injury, Wagh featured in Warwickshire's first team during 2006 after strong performances in the Twenty20 season, promoted following injury to Warwickshire teammate, Nick Knight. At the end of 2006, despite having two years remaining on his Warwickshire contract, the county allowed him to move to Nottinghamshire. Wagh was rewarded for his consistent batting form with Nottinghamshire's Player of the Season award for 2007. He wrote a diary of his 2008 season, which was published under the title Pavilion to Crease ... and Back.Fairfield Books website Wagh retired from professional cricket on 1 June 2011 to pursue a career in law. He is undertaking a training contract with international law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer.

Latin versions were written by Oddr Snorrason, and by Gunnlaugr Leifsson; both are now lost, but are thought to survive in Norse transcriptions including that recorded by Snorri Sturluson in Heimskringla; the most detailed version is √ìl√°fs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta [The Greatest Saga of √ìl√°fr Tryggvason], found in the Flateyjarb√≥k, Bergsb√≥k, and other manuscripts. Versions There are several versions of the saga, some now lost. It is thought that both Snorri Sturluson (in the Heimskringla) and the author of √ìl√°fs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta made use of Oddr Snorrason's 12th century latin version work. It is difficult to tell how closely the Old Norse translation(s) of Oddr's √ìl√°fs saga resembles the Latin original but it clearly owes a debt to hagiography, presenting King √ìl√°fr as the apostle to the Norwegians.Yngvars saga v√≠√∞f√∂rla Oddr Snorrason An account of Olaf's life (√ìl√°fs saga Tryggvasonar) was recorded by Oddr Snorrason in the 12th century in latin. The work is considered to be the first full length icelandic saga. Its subject is the 10th-century Norwegian king √ìl√°fr Tryggvason. The original work has been almost completely lost but a translation into Old Norse is preserved in two nearly complete versions and a fragment of a third. Oddr made use of previous written works including those of S√¶mundr fr√≥√∞i and Ari √ûorgilsson as well as Acta sanctorum in Selio and possibly Historia de Antiquitate Regum Norwagiensium. Gunnlaugr Leifsson Gunnlaugr Leifsson also composed a Latin biography of √ìl√°fr Tryggvason. This work is now lost but it is believed to have been an expansion of the Latin √ìl√°fs saga Tryggvasonar written by his monastic brother, Oddr Snorrason. Snorri Sturluson made use of Gunnlaugr's work when composing his Heimskringla and sections of Gunnlaugr's work were incorporated into √ìl√°fs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta. Some parts are also thought to survive in Vatnsd√¶la saga. Fagrskinna Oddr Snorrason's version is thought to be a source for the account of √ìl√°fs Tryggvasonar in the early 13th century Fagrskinna. Heimskringla √ìl√°fs saga Tryggvasonar is recorded in the c.1230s Heimskringla by Snorri Sturluson. √ìl√°fs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta The √ìl√°fs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta also known as Mesta or the Greatest Saga of √ìl√°fr Tryggvason is an extended biography of √ìl√°fr Tryggvason. The work was compiled c. 1300. It contains detail on the conversion (to christianity) of the king √ìl√°fr Tryggvason and of the skald Hallfre√∞r vandr√¶√∞ask√°ld. The work uses Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla, with increased narrative detail, including information from the saga 'biographies' by both Oddr Snorrason and Gunnlaugr Leifsson, and other works.

Since 1999 the Strong Angel series has focused on field experimentation within very challenging environments, testing the use of cutting-edge techniques and technologies to facilitate more effective humanitarian response. The name for the event, Strong Angel, was chosen to recognize two important influences in the humanitarian response sector. The first was \\"Operation Sea Angel\\" in 1991, an impromptu rescue operation led by General Henry Stackpole leading a US Navy Amphibious Task Force in urgent response to an unnamed cyclone in Bangladesh. That rescue operation is generally credited with saving up to 200,000 lives and stimulated the entire field of research around complex operations in humanitarian response. The second influence was the insightful DARPA Program Manager responsible for the original civil-military integration concept, Dr. Gary Strong. There are several specific sectors tested in each Strong Angel event, with the general goals of (1) improved information flow, (2) the provisioning of urgent and sustainable critical services, and (3) trans- boundary cooperation, all in the aftermath of a disaster. Each of the three Strong Angel demonstrations have been broadly international in nature, with more than 15 nations participating in the 2006 event. The ethos of the demonstration is \\"radical inclusion\\" on the supposition that good ideas can come from anywhere - and especially from within the communities most at risk. Everything created by any Strong Angel event is released to the public domain. Demonstrations have been held in 2000, 2004, and 2006, and the structural capability remains in 2019 within the Center for Resilient and Sustainable Communities (C-RASC) at George Mason University in Washington DC, and in the STAR-TIDES network established in the aftermath of the 2006 Strong Angel event. Team The Strong Angel demonstrations have been designed and performed by a globally distributed team of experts led by Eric Rasmussen, MD, a former US Navy Commander and the Fleet Surgeon for the US Navy's Third Fleet. Members of the Strong Angel team have included medical, military, humanitarian, diplomatic, and technology experts. Team members have been drawn from the public and private sector, civilian and military, domestic and international, and they have included engineers, UN staff, humanitarian NGO workers, academic researchers, government employees from several nations, journalists, inventors, policy makers, and active duty military officers.Unfilled Promise, Baseline Magazine, Case 165, May 2005 Strong Angel Executive Committee members during past events, and their current career positions in 2019, include Gay Mathews (CEO of the North Hawaii Credit Union in Honoka'a, Big Island, Hawaii), Robert Kirkpatrick (Executive Director of the UN's Global Pulse initiative within the Office of the Secretary-General of the United Nations), John Crowley (Senior Manager within the Global Facility for Disaster Risk and Recovery within the World Bank in Washington DC), Suzanne Mikawa Kirkpatrick (formerly the Program Manager within the Office of the Executive at Microsoft, now with a master's degree in User-Centered Design and working in New York), Doug Hanchard (Executive Director of Rapid Response Consulting in Ottawa, Canada and London UK), Pete Griffiths (Deputy Division Chief, Future Warfare Systems Division, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency), Nigel Snoad (Director of Global Disaster Response for Google), David Warner (owner of the Taj near Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan where he runs a collaborative education program for schools in Nangarhar Province near the Kyber Pass), Brian Steckler (director of the Hastily Formed Networks program within the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California and Lead Architect of the Rapid Telecommunications Assessment Team (RTAT) initiative), Clare Lockhart (Senior Executive within the Institute for State Effectiveness in Washington DC), Adam Royce (faculty at San Diego State University), and Eric Frost (Professor of Geology and Director of the Visualization Laboratory at San Diego State University). Vice-Admiral Dennis McGinn was a sponsor of the Strong Angel concept in 1999 and was named in July 2013 the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Energy, Installations, and the Environment. Dr. Lin Wells, mentor to many of the Executive Committee members and source funding for the dominant share of the Strong Angel III budget, was the Chief Information Officer for the US Department of Defense and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration. He later served as the Director of the Center for Technology and National Security Policy within National Defense University in Washington DC before his transition to the private sector in June 2014. At that point he had completed 51 years of government service. Dr. Wells, as of 2020, remains the founder and director of the STAR-TIDES network, established in 2007, and Executive Advisor to the George Mason University Center for Resilient and Sustainable Communities (C-RASC) , which was established in 2019 as a trans-disciplinary research and teaching center after a university-wide competition. The Center for the Management of Information (CMI) at the University of Arizona provided significant planning, technical, and collaboration support to the first three Strong Angel events and professionally facilitated group meetings as part of a four-year DARPA investigation into collaboration methodologies with the US Navy's Third Fleet. Afloat Civil-Military Operations Center One of the early concepts tested within the Strong Angel Demonstration was a shipboard Civil-Military Operations Center or CMOC, designed to be as valuable to the civilian humanitarian community as to the military, despite being located on a Navy warship. In an uncommon gesture of civil-military collaboration, UN agency staff from World Food Programme, UNHCR, and UNICEF, as well as international military staff from Australia, Peru, Chile, and Japan, agreed to meet aboard the US Navy warship USS Coronado (AGF-11), the Command Ship for Third Fleet, five days before the start of the first Strong Angel event. While aboard, humanitarian staff were provided with office workspaces, living quarters, hot showers, good food, reliable communications (both voice and data), scheduled transportation ashore, and a range of humanitarian agency meeting spaces aboard the ship. The result was objectively and subjectively evaluated to be an improved civil-military planning integration which enhanced mutual understanding of the charters and obligations, strengths and weaknesses, on each side of the civil-military boundary. The results were eventually briefed personally to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and deemed a valuable model for civil-military collaboration. Opportunities for early civil-military integration during the planning phase of operations have since been recognized and implemented for real-world events in Iraq (the Humanitarian Operations Center), in Afghanistan, and in the formation of the Combined Coordination Center during the response to the Indonesian tsunami. Those efforts proved beneficial, and resulted in the US Department of Defense creating a Joint Publication, JP 3-57, establishing doctrine around Civil- Military Operations. Templates and checklists for several classes of Navy ships and a range of disaster types remain available. Demonstration series Strong Angel I in 2000 The first Strong Angel (SA-I) was held near Puu Pa'a on the Big Island of Hawaii in June 2000 to address problems seen in the international response to the Kosovo refugee migration. Strong Angel participants established a distributed medical intelligence communications infrastructure at a mock refugee camp using the then-latest global communications technologiesSyracuse University researchers team up with international agencies, SU News, June 2000 and lessons learned from the social sciences. That first Strong Angel, an ad hoc integration of UN relief agencies and international militaries working in concert toward a serious humanitarian problem generated positive press in both domestic US and international newspapers and magazines. Several reasons were proposed for the success, but credit must be given to the early support received from senior UN field staff present within the earliest planning conferences that were hosted by the US Navy.Strong Angel extension to RIMPAC 2000 Benefit was also derived from the senior military commander at Strong Angel mandating military participation in a humanitarian effort at a level equal to the intensity required for combat. That requirement was later incorporated within the 2005 US Department of Defense Directive 3000.05, the seminal document mandating that the US military become effective at stability, security, transition and reconstruction (SSTR) operations, a subset of which is military support to humanitarian operations. Strong Angel II in 2004 The second Strong Angel (SA-II) was also held on a remote lava bed in Hawaii and, in 2004, pursued problems identified by members of the first Strong Angel team who were deployed to conflicts then underway in Afghanistan and Iraq. SA-II eventually incorporated 83 tasks designed to propose answers to problems seen in civil-military integration during those wartime deployments, including such topics as trans-boundary communications, civil-military transportation coordination, sustainable power provisioning, machine-based translation services, and competent cultural awareness. That set of tasks were addressed through the efforts of more than 60 staff on a remote and austere site on the lava beds north of Kailua-Kona, Hawaii and resulted in alterations in tactics, techniques, and procedures regarding international and coalition civil-military operations. Strong Angel III in 2006 The third in the Strong Angel series, SA-III in 2006 was designed to address problems seen in multiple natural and man-made disasters where Strong Angel members had deployed since 2004. Those events include the South Asian tsunami in December 2004, Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, Hurricane Rita in September 2005, and the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. SA-III was held in San Diego, California from 20‚Äì26 August 2006 with San Diego State University hosting the Strong Angel team. The team members were drawn from US government agencies, international and domestic militaries, First Responders, domestic and international humanitarian organizations, academia, and private volunteers and there were more than 800 participants involved both locally on the ground in San Diego, and remotely in multiple countries around the world. There were roughly 50 tasks and objectives identified for SA-III including the creation of community tools for use within a pandemic influenza response. The immediate goal after starting the demonstration was the development of a set of principles that would facilitate civil-military self-organization in future events. The overarching goal of the third SA event was more strategic than the first two events and promoted the development of tools and techniques for establishing a robust and resilient community-response capability for both natural and man-made disasters. The design of the week drew from the field experience of many agencies and entities with deep and successful experience in austere environments, including MedWeb for field diagnostics, telemedicine, and medical informatics, and the Naval Postgraduate School's Hastily Formed Networks for the urgent establishing of civil-military bridge mesh communications. Among the other objectives within SA-III was the development of social tools and techniques that encourage collaborative cooperation between responders and the population they serve during post-disaster reconstruction. Those relationships had previously served as a source of tension between the responder's procedural requirements and the stated needs of the people directly affected by the events, and some progress was made toward procedures that might alleviate that friction. The tools and techniques proposed for answering the tasks were selected for testing and demonstration based on several criteria, but each needed to be commercially availability for international deployment by the end of the 2006 calendar year. The Future of the Strong Angel Series Fortunately, the idea of a collaborative civil- military international disaster response capability is now relatively routine. US INDO-PACIFIC Command in Hawaii, for example, has established Pacific Angel as an annual event commemorating the original Strong Angel series and similarly dedicated to work on civil-military collaboration around the Pacific Rim.. However, as of 2019, the threats from climate change posed to Pacific Atoll Nations by sea-level rise, overwash events, and fresh-water shortfalls has brought the Strong Angel series design - an international disaster response demonstration - back into active discussion. One aspect of Strong Angel III in San Diego, for example, had been focused on infectious pandemics and, in addition to changes in climate, a number of remote and vulnerable Pacific island nations are suffering from relatively new infectious diseases like chikungunya and Zika virus, and a resurgence of more familiar diseases like dengue, typhoid fever, and resistant tuberculosis. Each of those issues are embedded within changing ecosystems and might benefit from a re-visiting of the problem set last addressed formally in 2006. Now, however, those problems could be addressed using exponential advances in technology, epidemiology, and data visualization, and a much deeper understanding of systems science, to assess the interventions that might improve the resilience of those vulnerable communities.
