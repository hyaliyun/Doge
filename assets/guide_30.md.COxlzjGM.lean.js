She was five-feet-six-inches tall, with dark reddish-brown hair and green eyes. She is best known for her film roles as the Empress Poppaea in Quo Vadis (1951) and the alien Nyah in Devil Girl from Mars (1954).  Early life  Patricia Laffan was the daughter of Irish-born Arthur Charles Laffan (1870-1948) and London-born Elvira Alice Vitali (1896-1979). She described her father as 'a successful rubber planter in Malaya'. Her parents returned to the British Isles shortly before the birth of their daughter in London. On seeing the MGM film The Broadway Melody (1929) at the age of ten, Patricia decided she wanted to act. She was educated at schools in Folkestone, Kent, and at the Institut Fran√ßais in London. At the Webber- Douglas Dramatic School she studied acting. She also studied dancing at the De Vos Ballet School.  Career  Laffan's first film appearance was in One Good Turn (1936). She joined the Oxford Playhouse Repertory Company, and her first stage appearance was as Jenny Diver in The Beggar's Opera (January 1937) at the Oxford Playhouse. Her first London appearance was as the Young Girl in Surprise Item (25 February 1938) at the Ambassadors Theatre. Her first credited film part may have been as a cast member in Cross Beams (1940). She toured military bases throughout England during World War II, appearing in Hay Fever and Twelfth Night. In the period 1946-1947 she appeared in six teleplays for the BBC, in which she had substantial roles and was always credited. From this point onwards her film roles were also more substantial and always credited. In 1947 she was cast with Don Stannard in the short mystery film Death in High Heels as Magda Doon, a fashion model and unintended murder victim. In 1948 she was in another short film, Who Killed Van Loon?, starring Raymond Lovell. In 1950 she appeared in the feature-length crime drama Hangman's Wharf as Rosa Warren, a glamorous film star. In the M-G-M Technicolor film Quo Vadis (1951) she played Poppaea, the second wife of the Roman Emperor Nero (Peter Ustinov). The producer and director of the epic blockbuster selected her for this major role after they watched a screen-test she had made for a smaller part in the film. This was her first film in colour, and it was the biggest, longest, most expensive and most commercially successful film in which she would appear. With costumes by Herschel McCoy, hairstyles by Sydney Guilaroff, jewellery by Joseff of Hollywood, and two pet cheetahs on golden leashes she was the most fabulous-looking character on the screen. Her performance as Poppaea has drawn considerable praise over the years. In Escape Route (1952), a crime thriller starring George Raft, she played Irma Brooks. She starred as the ruthless, PVC-clad alien Nyah in the science fiction movie Devil Girl from Mars (1954), which is now a cult classic. She had a sizeable supporting role as Miss Alice MacDonald in 20th Century Fox's CinemaScope mystery thriller 23 Paces to Baker Street (1956). By the 1960s she appeared mainly on radio and television, including performances in Anna Karenina, The Aspern Papers, and Rembrandt, and panel game shows such as Petticoat Line and Call My Bluff. In the late 1960s and 1970s she produced and choreographed fashion shows around the world. The 10 July 1954 issue of Picture Show magazine featured \\"The Life Story of Patricia Laffan\\", which included these facts: Laffan had a piece printed in Winter Pie -- Miscellany for Men & Women ( A Pie Pocket Special), published in October 1947. It was entitled \\"Penicillin and Paris\\" and was a breezy account of her \\"first weekend in Paris,\\" under doctor's orders to take vitamins and a holiday. She was \\"wined and dined on the right bank and on the left\\" and broadcast (and sang Night and Day with a large band) over Radiodiffusion Francaise. There is a reference to the fact that she was appearing in the film The Rake's Progress, then showing in Paris. The Pittston Gazette on 20 January 1955 had an item discussing Laffan's first visit to the United States for a combination of work and vacation. She was scouting out panel and quiz shows (she appeared in several in England) to compare notes on American methods. She noted that \\"The air's so good here.\\" On 25 January 1956, the Daily Reporter ran an item from Louella Parsons: ‚ÄúHollywood is talking about the uncanny resemblance of British actress Patricia Laffan to Gertrude Lawrence, and the interest in Patricia to play the Lawrence biography‚Ä¶‚Äù Later life Laffan was interviewed in London on 21 March 1998 by Lisa Cohen, for her book All We Know (Farrar, Straus and Giroux 2012), an account of the lives of three women: New York intellectual Esther Murphy Strachey, writer-feminist Mercedes de Acosta, and British Vogue fashion editor Madge Garland. Laffan had a tangential connection to Garland, who was romantically involved with divorce lawyer Frances (Fay) Blacket Gill, one of the first women solicitors in England. Laffan is referred to as Gill's \\"last girlfriend\\", and she briefly discusses Gill and her relationship with Garland. In 2008, Laffan was interviewed by Matthew Sweet for the BBC 4 documentary Truly, Madly, Cheaply: British B Movies. She died at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London on 10 March 2014, just nine days short of her 95th birthday. The cause of death was given as multiple organ failure due to an acute kidney problem.

(retrieved 3 Feb 2010) Neighboring tribes, such as the Kickapoo and Delaware, have similar women's hair ornaments. A dush-toh consists of an embellished, butterfly- or hourglass-shaped frame that is worn on the back of the head with ribbons that flow down the back, almost to the ground. They were made in the 19th and 20th centuries,Ellison 11 as well as into the present. Frame The top of the butterfly-shaped frame is typically 4.25 inches wide and the bottom is usually 4-5/8 inches wide. The frame is 7.5 inches tall. The frame can be covered in black felt and edged with colored ribbons on both sides. Further embellishments include white seed beads sewn along the edges and silver studs placed according to the individual's preference. A silver band runs around the narrowest point of the frame, which is tied to the hair.Newkumet and Meredith, 42 A wooden hairpin can also be used to hold the dush-toh in place. German silver spots can be attached to the frame and beaded rosettes may be used to decorate the center of the frame. Ribbons Turkey Dance, Caddo Tribal Complex, Binger, Oklahoma, 2000. The dush-toh worn by the dancer on the far left is visible. The ribbons, usually of watered silk, are attached to the bottom of the headpiece. Four layers of ribbons are typically sewn to one ribbon band, which is sewn to the felt on the frame. Ribbons can be solid colors or plaid. They run down the back to the hemline of the dancer's dress. Bells, or cai'-coo-tze, can be sewn to the bottom for weight and a musical sound. Ribbons can be embellished with shell, mirrors, German silver medallions, or beadwork rosettes.

The film was based on a short story in \\"Ruidoso\\" (published April 29, 1974, in The New Yorker magazine) by John McPhee.HTF ReviewExcerpt from \\"Ruidoso\\", the short story of which this film was based Much of the exterior shots were done in the town of Carencro, LA (20 miles north of Lafayette, LA).  Plot  Down on his luck Louisiana horse trainer Lloyd Bourdelle (Walter Matthau) dreams of winning the All American Futurity at Ruidoso Downs in New Mexico. Lloyd has three sons: Buddy, Randy, and Casey. Buddy (Andrew Rubin) helps his father train horses, while Randy (Steve Burns) is a jockey. Lloyd takes Casey (Michael Hershewe) and Randy to a small bush track, to try to make some money by racing Casey's pony, Gypsy. They find a match race with Mr. Marsh (Robert Webber) and his daughter Kelly (Susan Myers) but play a trick on Marsh by tying a live chicken to Gypsy's saddle. Gypsy wins the race, but Marsh doesn't pay up, complaining that Lloyd cheated him by not having a rider on Gypsy. Lloyd had sent Buddy to buy a racing Quarter Horse for Calvin LaBec (Harry Caesar) (the man Lloyd trains race horses for) in the hopes of racing the horse that year, but Buddy returns home with an old broodmare. Calvin is angry with Lloyd and threatens to take his horses out of Lloyd's barn, until it is revealed that the mare is in foal to a stallion called Sure Hit. Calvin is placated by this information. The mare gives birth to a colt and then dies, leaving the family wondering how to raise him. Casey suggests letting Gypsy nurse the colt. Gypsy had just weaned her own foal, so the family gives it a try and Gypsy accepts the colt. Casey feeds and raises the young colt, who grows into a strong two-year-old. Lloyd names the horse Casey's Shadow, after his son. A woman named Sarah Blue (Alexis Smith) goes to see the Bourdelle family, to offer Lloyd a large sum of money for the colt. They tell her they won't sell until after the All American, so Sarah agrees to pay $5,000 for an option contract, against a future negotiated purchase price, if she exercises the option. The option money gives them the money for entering the colt in the race. They take the horse to the local track to gallop him. While they are there, Casey runs into Mr. Marsh's daughter, who tells him he owes her five dollars. She goads Casey into having a match race for it, but during the race, Shadow spooks and runs onto hard asphalt, hurting his legs. The vet tells Lloyd and Buddy to rest the horse for six weeks. Calvin finds out the horse is injured but allows Lloyd to enter Shadow in the All American. Shadow runs in one of ten qualifying races for the All American, where he gets the fastest time in his race. Mr Marsh realizes that Shadow could beat his horse in the All American, sneaks into the barn where Shadow is stabled, and puts poison in the food bucket. But he has poisoned the wrong horse, and Gypsy slumps to the ground dead. Casey is heartbroken, and Lloyd, realizing that Marsh was responsible for the pony's death, tracks down and beats up Marsh. The next day, Shadow wins the All American but is found afterwards to be severely lame. Sarah Blue is upset because she wanted to buy the colt sound and is no longer interested in the horse. Calvin LaBec at first agrees with the vet that the horse should be destroyed, but seeing how this would affect Casey, Lloyd says he'll give up his share of the winnings to treat the horse. Reluctantly, the vet agrees to try to mend Shadow's legs. The operation is a success, and Lloyd and his sons take Shadow home.

Early life and family Maria Ferdinanda was born to Maximilian, Crown Prince of Saxony and his first wife Princess Caroline of Parma on 27 April 1796. She was their second eldest daughter. As her mother died in 1804, her father remarried in 1825 to Princess Maria Luisa Carlota of Parma, but this marriage would produce no new siblings. Her father died in 1838, having renounced his rights to the succession of Saxony in favor of his eldest son. Maria Ferdinanda had seven siblings, most of whom married well. Her older sister was Princess Amalie, a notable composer. Her next younger brother would become Frederick Augustus II of Saxony in 1836. Her next brother was Prince Klemens, who would die at the age of 24. Her next three siblings (Maria Anna, John, and Maria Josepha Amalia) would become by birth or marriage Grand Duchess of Tuscany, King of Saxony, and Queen of Spain respectively. In 1817, Maria Ferdinanda accompanied her younger sister Princess Maria Anna of Saxony to Florence, where she was going to marry the future Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany.Toscana, p. 18. The two were very close, so that Maria Anna was too scared to go without Maria Ferdinanda's company. The couple duly married. Something decidedly unexpected occurred however. Maria Ferdinanda caught the eye of Leopold's elderly father Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Marriage Maria Ferdinanda in 1822, the year after her marriage. On 6 May 1821, Maria Ferdinanda was married to Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany in Florence. She was his second wife, and he was twenty-seven years older. She was his first cousin once removed as well as a first cousin once removed of his first wife Princess Luisa of Naples. Ferdinand may have desired this second marriage because the succession was in doubt: though his only son had recently married Maria Ferdinanda‚Äôs sister Maria Anna, he was considered sickly. No children were born of this marriage. As Maria Ferdinanda's younger sister Princess Maria Anna of Saxony was married to Ferdinand's son Leopold, Maria Ferdinanda thus became her own sister's step-mother-in-law. Ferdinand died in 1824 in Florence, causing his son Leopold, and Leopold's wife Maria Anna, to succeed as Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Tuscany. Later life In 1859, the Tuscan royal family lost their claims to the throne during the Italian Unification. The royal family left the Palazzo Pitti in Florence for the Austrian court of Emperor Francis Joseph and Empress Elisabeth in Vienna. Maria Ferdinanda lived mainly from then on in Schlackenwerth, but was often a guest of her brother King John of Saxony in Dresden. She had an especially close relationship with her sister Amalie. Maria Ferdinanda was a bearer of the royal Order of the Noble Ladies of Maria Luisa, an order founded by Queen Maria Louisa of Spain. Maria Ferdinanda remained a widow for forty-one years, finally dying on 3 January 1865. She was buried in the Imperial Crypt, Vienna.

It was signed between the government of Tanzania and City Water, a consortium consisting of the former British firm Biwater, Gauff Engineers from Germany and a Tanzanian company called Superdoll. The government terminated the lease contract in May 2005 amid mutual allegations of breach of contract, and deported the three top executives of City Water.  The situation before privatization  According to a report of ActionAid, before privatisation \\"the water system in Dar es Salaam was hardly a model of public sector efficiency.\\" Until 1991, water was provided for free, except for some high income areas. The system was characterized by \\"disrepair, a lack of investment, high levels of wastage, and very poor levels of service coverage\\". In 1997 the semi-autonomous utility DAWASA was created and water tariffs were introduced for all users. According to the report, \\"DAWASA proved to be no better than its predecessor, and the wastage and disrepair reached crisis levels.\\" By 2003 \\"only 98,000 households in a city of 2.5 million people had house connections. Only 26% of water was being billed, 60% was lost through leaks, and a further 13% through unauthorised use, illegal taps and non- payers. Even those with connections only received water irregularly, and the water quality was poor. In low-income areas, the vast majority of households had no water connection at all, relying instead on buying water from kiosks, water vendors or their neighbours, at more than three times the price.\\" Greenhill, R. and Wekiya, I. (2004). Turning off the taps : donor conditionality and water privatisation in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, London, UK, ActionAid, p. 5  Donor support and conditionality  External donor investment produced the lease contract through soft loans worth US$145.5 million for a Dar es Salaam Water Supply and Sanitation Project approved by the World Bank in 2003. The African Development Bank contributed US$48m, the European Investment Bank US$34m and the World Bank US$61.5m. The private company was supposed to contribute US$8.5m from its own funds and the Tanzanian government was supposed to contribute US$12.6m. World Bank:Dar es Salaam Water Supply and Sanitation Project, accessed on February 3, 2010 The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund set conditions for further loans to Tanzania contingent on the privatization of state-run organisations. According to research by ActionAid, in 2000 the \\"signing of a concession agreement assigning the assets of DAWASA (the public utility for Dar es Salaam) to private management companies\\" was included as a condition for debt relief under the HIPC initiative. When lack of investor interest meant that Tanzania was unable to comply with this condition, donors agreed to waive it. They then asked for a lease contract instead of a concession, implying a shorter contract duration and less responsibilities transferred to the private company. Greenhill, R. and Wekiya, I. (2004). Turning off the taps : donor conditionality and water privatisation in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, London, UK, ActionAid, p. 3 Still according to ActionAid \\"there has been very little meaningful public participation or consultation, limited public debate, and no the privatisation process. Even the country‚Äôs elected MPs have been kept largely in the dark.\\" Greenhill, R. and Wekiya, I. (2004). Turning off the taps : donor conditionality and water privatisation in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, London, UK, ActionAid, p. 2 The Department for International Development paid Adam Smith International, sister organisation of the neo- liberal UK thinktank Adam Smith Institute, more than ¬£500,000 to provide advice to the Tanzanian government. More than ¬£250,000 of that sum was spent by Adam Smith International on a video which included the words: \\"Our old industries are dry like crops and privatisation brings the rain.\\" The Guardian:Flagship water privatisation fails in Tanzania, 25 May 2005 The contract was awarded through international bidding, but City Water was the only company that submitted a bid.  Impact  ActionAid UK claimed that water users in Dar es Salaam faced soaring bills and mass disconnections since 2003. It also said that City Water disconnected whole areas in an attempt to get people with illegal connections to pay up. They found that poor families turned to unsafe water supplies rather than pay the increased bills. \\"Donors have been pushing through a project in which 98% of the investment will go to the areas where the richest 20% of the population live,\\" said Billy Abimbilla, director of ActionAid Tanzania. Greenhill, R. and Wekiya, I. (2004). Turning off the taps : donor conditionality and water privatisation in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, London, UK, ActionAid, p. 2 \\"Unprofitable areas\\" ‚Äì where the poor reside ‚Äì were given to non-governmental organizations and were not part of the area of the private responsibility. WaterAid, CARE and Plan International were to be subcontracted under World Bank funding to carry out water projects in low income areas which were unlikely to be served by the piped network for some time. This component of the World Bank project only accounted for $3-$4m, or roughly 2%, of the total project costs. Greenhill, R. and Wekiya, I. (2004). Turning off the taps : donor conditionality and water privatisation in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, London, UK, ActionAid, p. 16 Tanzania's water minister, Edward Lowassa, said that no new pipes have been installed, the company has not spent the money it had promised, water quality has declined, and that revenue has decreased. According to Mussa Billegeya of the Tanzania Association of NGOs (TANGO) Biwater was doing almost none of what they were supposed to do. They didn‚Äôt pay the lease fee to the government. They owed around US$3.5 million to the government in 2005. According to Cliff Stone, the British chief executive of City Water, the government breached the lease contract. He said that water quality and quantity had improved. He also claimed the Tanzanian government had given the company wrong data about water supplies and the delays were not of City Water's making. He also said the Tanzanian government owed the company US$3m. He acknowledged, however, that the project was well behind schedule and that no pipes had been installed. Biwater said it invested ¬£7m in City Water.  Legal aftermath  A London tribunal threw out a case brought by CWS under the rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). The tribunal, citing World Bank evidence, found that water and sewerage services had deteriorated under CWS's management. It awarded ¬£3m in damages to DAWASA, the Tanzanian water utility, and half a million pounds in legal costs. It pointed to a World Bank study in 2005 which concluded: \\"The primary assumption on the part of almost all involved, certainly from the donor side, was that it would be hard if not impossible for the private sector operator to perform worse than DAWASA, but that is what happened.\\" The Guardian: Tanzania wins ¬£3m damages from Biwater subsidiary, 11 January 2008 Since City Water is defunct and has no assets, the damages and legal costs have not been paid. In a separate legal case the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) ruled that Tanzania's government had violated its bilateral investment treaty with the UK by expelling City Water on four separate counts: unlawful expropriation of assets, a failure to provide fair and equitable treatment, unreasonable and discriminatory conduct and a failure to provide full protection and security. Biwater: Biwater Response to Outcome of ICSID Arbitration, 28 July 2008 However, it also threw out a ¬£10m damages claim made by Biwater, saying that there were no damages to award as the company's value was \\"nil\\" at the time of expropriation. ICSID's ruling showed that while Biwater publicly denied culpability for City Water's poor performance at the time, its executives were aware of the company's shortcomings. \\"Our City Water staffing was totally with non-Biwater staff with a weak leader, no clear experience or qualified business plan,\\" wrote Adrian White, a former BBC governor, who holds the majority stake in Biwater, early in 2005. The Guardian:Biwater fails in Tanzanian damages claim, 28 July 2008 Biwater reacted to the decision by saying that \\"the Tribunal's decision not to award damages or costs (to Biwater) has sent an extremely negative message to the international investment community.\\"  See also  Water supply and sanitation in Tanzania  Further reading  WaterAid:Private sector participation in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, ca. 2001.

The Man who Walks I) is the name of any one of the cast bronze sculptures that comprise six numbered editions plus four artist proofs created by Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti in 1961. On 3 February 2010, the second edition of the cast of the sculpture became one of the most expensive works of art ever sold at auction, for $104.3 million. Its price meant it was considered the most expensive sculpture, until May 2015, when another Giacometti work, L'Homme au doigt, surpassed it. The sculpture Four views of L'Homme qui marche I depicted on the 1998 version of the 100 Swiss Franc banknote The bronze sculpture depicts a lone man in mid-stride with his arms hanging at his side. The piece is described as \\"both a humble image of an ordinary man, and a potent symbol of humanity\\". Giacometti is said to have viewed \\"the natural equilibrium of the stride\\" as a symbol of \\"man's own life force\\".. In 1960, Giacometti was asked to be part of a public project by the Chase Manhattan Plaza in New York to plant bronze figures outside the building. He created several sculptures, with L'Homme qui marche I among them. Giacometti struggled with the project and eventually abandoned the commission. However, in 1961 he cast the life-size work in bronze and exhibited it at the Venice Biennale a year later. L'Homme Qui Marche I was created at the high point of Giacometti's mature period and represents the pinnacle of his experimentation with the human form. The piece is considered to be one of the most important works by the artist and one of the most iconic images of Modern art. Edition number one of the sculpture is located at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Edition number two belongs in a private collection. Other casts of L'Homme qui marche I include those at the Fondation Maeght in Saint-Paul, Alpes-Maritimes, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, NY, and Louisiana Museum of Modern Art near Copenhagen, Denmark. Auction L'Homme qui marche II, a closely related sculpture in the series On 3 February 2010, edition number two of the sculpture came up for auction at Sotheby's auction house in London. The piece was sold by German banking group Commerzbank, which had acquired it when it took over the Dresdner Bank in 2009. The sale of the sculpture marked the first time in 20 years that a life-size Giacometti figure of a walking man came to auction. It had been estimated to sell for between ¬£12 and ¬£18 million, but in just eight minutes the sculpture was bought by Lily Safra, widow of the prominent Lebanese banker Edmond Safra for ¬£58 million. Including the buyer's premium the price reached ¬£65 million (US$103.7 million). The piece broke the record for a Giacometti work at auction, which was set at $27.5 million by Grande Femme Debout II in 2008, and that for the most expensive sculpture sold at a public auction, which was held by the 5000-year-old Guennol Lioness, sold at Sotheby's in 2007 for $57.2 m. When expressed in British pounds and when inflation is ignored, the bronze also broke the record price for an art work sold at auction which, since 2004, was held at $104.2 million (then ¬£58.2 m) by Pablo Picasso's Gar√ßon √† la pipe. The most expensive work of art sold at a public auction remained Van Gogh's Portrait of Dr. Gachet, which was bought in May 1990 for $82.5 million (approx. $138.4 million in CPI-adjusted 2010 US dollars),CPI Inflation Calculator, US Bureau of Labor Statistics. while Jackson Pollock's No. 5, 1948, which was privately sold for $140 million in 2006 (approx. $151 million in 2010 dollars), remained the most expensive work of art sold overall.

Homage was a sculpture by Haydn Davies, commissioned by Lambton College to stand outside the school's main entrance in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada. It was constructed in 1975 and destroyed by the college in 2005. History In 1974, the college commissioned Davies to construct Homage, a wooden structure, outside the main entrance of the college. James Adams of The Globe and Mail called Homage, \\"one of Canada's most famous public sculptures\\".  Destruction  In June 2005, the college tore it down with a backhoe, citing safety concerns due to an ant infestation and other animals degrading the structure. Davies' son Bryan evaluated the damage as only superficial and contended the sculpture could have been repaired. In negotiations about compensation to Davies for the destruction, the Davies family proposal included an apology and commissioning of a new $60,000 sculpture by Davies. Lambton College was unwilling to fund a new piece and unlikely to apologize stating, \\"we believe Lambton was well within its moral and legal rights\\". The college president Tony Hanlon in an email to Bryan sought assurances that there would be no further public criticism of the college. Bryan Davies stated, \\"My father cannot, in good conscience, agree not to speak out\\". In 2006, Davies sued the college for $1.2 million, contending the college failed to maintain the structure. Davies died in 2008 and the lawsuit was settled in 2010, with the details not made public. Bryan Davies made a video homage2Homage which called it an arbitrary decision to destroy the structure. The story of the sculpture's destruction inspired a play, called Homage, by Anthony Black. The play was first produced in 2009 by 2b theatre company of Halifax, Nova Scotia.

It stars 54-year-old Maureen O'Sullivan as the wife of a businessman (played by 64-year old Paul Ford) who discovers, after 25 years of marriage, she is to become a mother for the second time. Plot Harry Lambert is a New England lumber company executive in a humdrum life with his wife Edith. He feels his life has grown stale since his recent defeat in an election for town mayor. Adding to his frustrations, the mayor who defeated him in the election is a neighbour. His adult daughter Kate is of little or no help to anybody; she and her husband Charlie live with Harry and Edith, and Charlie lives a freeloader's life, working at the lumber company. Bothered by unexplained fatigue, Edith is persuaded by her friend Grace (Jane Wyatt) to go see a doctor. Edith learns she is pregnant. Her daughter Kate wishes she were also pregnant. Kate begins pressuring her husband Charlie to get her pregnant, without success. Harry doesn't want to be a father again at his age; in his sixties, he worries that he will be in his eighties when the child graduates from college, making him embarrassed and feeling foolish. He also complains about Edith's spending, particularly after a misjudged prank by Charlie and himself insulting the mayor leads to their losing a lumber supply contract for a new stadium. Despite his many complaints, Harry is genuinely taken aback when Edith announces she is leaving him to move to Boston and have the baby by herself. Harry pursues Edith to bring her back, while Charlie finally comes through by winning back the stadium contract.

In nature, water and water vapor polarize the sunlight (which itself is slightly polarized). By receiving the direction of polarized photons, some species can correct their course during migration. Artificial polarization of natural or artificial light can disrupt the behavior of these species and the ecosystems in which these species play an important role. Pollination is one example of this.  History of this notion Jean-Baptiste Biot and his successors have shown that solutions of organic products, such as fructose or sucrose, can polarize light. However, only in recent decades has it been realised that the polarized light may play an important role in ecosystems, especially in the insect world. More recently, when the concept of light pollution emerged, the question of the possible impacts of the artificial polarization of light has arisen. G√°bor Horv√°th and his team have proposed that this new term needs to be better described and understood in order to better address the specific ecological consequences (direct or delayed in space and time) of light that was polarized (at source or by interacting with objects made or modified by humans).

The faction emerged during 1930 and 1931 and achieved practical control of the organization in 1934. The existence of the \\"Militants\\" and the threat they represented to the political line of the SPA caused traditional electorally oriented members to form an organized grouping of their own, known as the \\"Old Guard faction.\\" In 1935 the personal and political friction between these two basic tendencies lead to an organizational split, with the Old Guard faction leaving to establish the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). The Militant faction itself shattered in the aftermath of the 1935 party split with only a small core loyal to perennial Presidential candidate Norman Thomas remaining in the organization by the coming of World War II. History State of the Socialist Party in the late 1920s The 1919 Emergency National Convention of the Socialist Party of America saw the departure of the proto-communist Left Wing Section, leaving control of the party's name, emblems, and assets in the hand of the Regular faction headed by Adolph Germer, James Oneal, and Morris Hillquit. The victory proved to be Pyrrhic, with tens of thousands of members suspended or expelled by the National Executive Committee. An entire generation of the organization's most energetic young activists departed to join the ranks of the fledgling Communist Party of America and Communist Labor Party of America. Socialist Party membership plummeted from a peak of over 104,000 paid members in April 1919 to fewer than 9,000 in the first quarter of 1928.\\"Socialist Party of America Annual Membership Figures,\\" Early American Marxism website. Retrieved February 3, 2010. Moreover, the party was nearly insolvent: its coffers empty, printing bill unpaid, and the organization nearly two years in arrears in the payment of its dues to the Labor and Socialist International in Switzerland.David A. Shannon, The Socialist Party of America: A History. New York: Macmillan, 1955; pg. 202. Formation of the Militant faction Even though the Militant faction emerged as a coherent unit in the Socialist Party late in 1930See, for eaxample, \\"Socialist 'Militants' Plan,\\" Labor Age, vol. 19, no. 10 (October 1930), pg. 3, which discusses a gathering of 100 young Socialist \\"Militants\\" at Camp Eden, near Cold Spring, New York, in August 1930. The session was chaired by Louis Stanley of the Rand School of Social Science and the Conference for Progressive Labor Action. and congealed in 1931, as early as 1926 observers were noting evidence of a fissure. Communist Party member Bertram D. Wolfe wrote in a September 1926 article tellingly entitled \\"The Socialist Party Furnishes Its 'Insurgents'\\": > \\"For some time there has been growing discontent manifested within the ranks > of New York Socialists, especially among the younger elements, against the > methods used by the [Jewish Daily] Forward crowd in fighting the Communists, > in opposing the united front proposals of the Workers (Communist) Party, in > splitting unions and other labor organizations and expelling progressive and > left wing elements, in using gangsterism ‚Äî in short, in all the methods > employed by the old socialist leadership to ruin the labor movement that > they can no longer rule.  * > > \\"Even a small section of the leadership, such men as Norman Thomas, have > been criticizing these policies ... because they are causing a further loss > of membership and a further disintegration of the Socialist Party. > > \\"The New Leader is a strange paper.

Wolfe, \\"The Socialist Party Furnishes Its > 'Insurgents,'\\" The Daily Worker, vol. 3, no. 214 (September 1926), pg. 6. Historian of the Socialist Party David A. Shannon noted that the \\"radical doctrinaire Marxists\\" of the Militant faction differed in orientation and emphasis from their factional opponents: > \\"The Militants were numerically a small group, but they were an extremely > vocal one. Philosophically the Militants were Marxists, as were their Old > Guard opposition. But the Militants leaned much further toward Marxism as > developed by Lenin than did the Old Guard, whose favorite theoreticians were > Karl Kautsky and Hillquit. Yet the Militants were not Communists. They were > opposed to the rigid discipline of the Third International, and they were > critical of the Soviet Union's denial of civil liberties, just as were Old > Guard Socialists. In many respects the ideological differences between the > Old Guard and the Militants were differences of emphasis.  * > > \\"One important difference between the Militants and their Old Guard > opponents was their viewpoints on democracy. The Old Guard was composed of > convinced democrats who held that socialism would advance democracy and come > to America only by democratic means. The Militants' view toward democracy > was in some respects similar to that of the Communists. Democracy was to > them a bourgeois quality, a device adopted by the bourgeoisie to defeat the > aristocracy that was now being abandoned by capitalists as their conflict > with the proletariat became more intense.\\"Shannon, The Socialist Party of > America, pp. 211-213. There was also a large generational component to the division of the Marxists of the Socialist Party into \\"Old Guard\\" and \\"Militant\\" camps. Historian Irving Howe, himself a young radical in the Socialist Party in the 1930s, later recalled this aspect: > \\"I am suspicious of 'generational' interpretations of politics, but I must > confess that with regard to the Socialist Party in the thirties it is > impossible to avoid at least some generational stress. The clash in style > was striking. Not only did the Old Guard treat the ideas of the Militants as > a repulsive sort of quasi-Bolshevism; it also found intolerable the > enthusiasm of these naive young comrades, their expectation that Norman > Thomas booming out the credo of 'socialism in our time' was something to be > taken seriously. The youth had entered the movement in the hope of creating > a new world, a new life, and now the old-timers came along, grumbling about > defeats, mistakes, betrayals. Each generation spoke for its own portion of > experience, and only if there had been in this country a line of socialist > continuity, so that each generation would not have to start as if from the > beginning might this collision have been avoided.\\"Irving Howe, Socialism and > America. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985; pg. 57. In an early issue of the SPA's theoretical magazine, The American Socialist Quarterly, editors Haim Kantorovitch, Anna Bercowitz, and David P. Berenberg allowed Militant faction adherent Theodore Shapiro space to declaim the Militants' political position. In this article, entitled \\"The 'Militant' Point of View,\\" Shapiro portrayed the Militant faction as part of an international left wing opposition movement: > \\"The rise of the militant group within the American Socialist Party > accompanies the growth of similar left wing groups throughout the western > world. These movements are in effect an active protest against the inactive > policies and tactics of the Labor and Socialist International with which our > party is affiliated and are, as well, protests against the astounding > inertia of so-called \\"Socialist leaders\\" the world over.

The differences between these groups are > fundamental both as to the concept of Socialism and the goal itself ... > > \\"In their support of reactionary governments, in compromising alliances > with non-revolutionary parties, in their attitude on the question of war, in > their naive reliance on bourgeois 'democratic' institutions, in their > hostility to the Soviet Republic, Social Democratic parties manifest their > reformism and block the way to the Socialist goal.\\"Theodore Shapiro, \\"The > 'Militant' Point of View,\\" The American Socialist Quarterly, vol. 1, no. 2 > (April 15, 1932), pg. 29. This journal has been reprinted in full in book > form as Socialist Review (1932-1940) (New York: Greenwood Reprint > Corporation, 1968). In reply to this article, the editors were critical the \\"anti-democratic propaganda\\" of \\"Comrade Shapiro and the militants,\\" noting that \\"Capitalism wants to suspend democracy\\" and therefore \\"it is in their interest to discredit the idea of democracy.\\" However, \\"instead of defending, the militants help discredit and disparage democracy; the wish to be super- revolutionary is likely to make them unconscious and unwilling helpers of the capitalist class in the latter's fight against democracy.\\"\\"Is This Militancy?\\" The American Socialist Quarterly, vol. 1, no. 2 (April 15, 1932), pg. 40. The article is unsigned, with the implication that it is a joint statement of the entire editorial board. The editors of The American Socialist Quarterly were outspoken in their criticism: > \\"These comrades have learned their Socialism not from Marx and Engels, but > from Soviet Russia; not even from Lenin but from Russian practice. That > Russia is building Socialism they have no doubt; but there is no freedom in > Russia, no democracy, no equality. Instead there is a dictatorship, a reign > of brute terror, of suppression of free thought, free criticism, free > living.\\"\\"Is This Militancy?\\" pg. 41. The Militants and their allies The Militant faction made common cause in their battle with the Old Guard with another significant factional group in the Socialist Party ‚Äî the so-called \\"Progressives\\" led by Norman Thomas and including such important SPA leaders as Devere Allen, Albert Sprague Coolidge, Darlington Hoopes, and Executive Secretary Clarence Senior. The Progressives, although more numerous than the Militants, were actually rather amorphous rather than a tightly disciplined faction, as historian David Shannon notes: > \\"The Progressives were no caucus within the party such as the Old Guard and > the Militants. They were a vague group of recent members, representing many > shades of opinion, who were greatly dissatisfied with the slowness, the lack > of activity, of the Old Guard. they were not doctrinaire Marxists; indeed, > many were not Marxian at all. Their goal was a realignment of American > politics whereby there would be a party to represent labor and dirt farmers, > based upon principles rather than upon thirst for office and political > opportunism. This party once in office would extend democracy and civil > liberties, socialize basic industries, and move rapidly in the direction of > what is nowadays called the welfare state. If the American electorate should > support the Socialist Party and make it such an organization, well and good; > if such a party should have to be a new organization, a national farmer- > labor party, then the Socialists should go into the new > organization.\\"Shannon, The Socialist Party of America, pg. 213. Split of the Old Guard In March 1935 the combined Progressives and Militants of the Socialist Party launched a new weekly newspaper in New York City to supplant the Old Guard-dominated The New Leader ‚Äî The Socialist Call. The Managing Editor of the new 12-page publication was Bruno Fischer, with Miliitant stalwart Jack Altman acting as Business Manager. The paper took direct aim at the Old Guard from the outset in declaring itself to be \\"the organ of revolutionary socialism\\": > \\"Revolutionary socialism aims at nothing less than the transfer of power to > the working class. This, and this alone, can save the workers from tyranny > and starvation, from wage-slavery and war. ... > > \\"As capitalism decays it is preparing to rivet upon the workers its open > dictatorship. It is preparing to destroy even those feeble democratic > institutions that it has so far allowed to exist. ... > > \\"Journals calling themselves 'Socialist' have failed in that they have > confused socialism with reform. They have in recent years lived in eternal > fear of offending labor leaders, and have therefore kept silent in the face > of reaction and racketeering within the unions. In doing so they have > damaged the reputation of the Socialist movement, and have lent aid and > comfort to the enemies of labor. They have failed to distinguish between the > 'liberalism' of Roosevelt and revolutionary socialism. There is need of a > Socialist organ that can differentiate between reforms for the preservation > of capitalism, and socialism.\\"\\"The Socialist Call,\\" The Socialist Call, vol. > 1, no. 1 (March 23, 1935), pg. 4. SPA National Chairman Leo Krzycki sent the new publication his warm greetings at the time of its launch, although beseeching it to \\"steer clear of party controversy.\\"\\"The Socialist Call Needed to Fight 'Radio Misleaders,' Chairman Krzycki Writes,\\" The Socialist Call, vol. 1, no. 1 (March 23, 1935), pg. 4. The participation of Norman Thomas was even more direct, as he launched a regular weekly column in the pages of The Socialist Call, a piece called \\"At the Front.\\" Other frequent contributors to the publication during its first year included Haim Kantorovitch, Samuel DeWitt, Herbert Zam, and McAlister Coleman.

He finished had his secondary education at the Kristiansand Cathedral School in 1925. He was cand.jur. from 1930, and finished the Police School in 1932. The broadcasting company was established as an office in Kristiansand in 1930, with Olaf Benneche as leader and Hougen as his assistant. When Benneche died in 1931, Hougen was responsible for the Kristiansand office, in addition to being an assistant judge in Kristiansand. The State-controlled Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (, NRK) took over after Kringkastingsselskapet in 1933. During the 1930s Hougen worked part-time for NRK as well as being a police officer. He became known as \\"the voice from S√∏rlandet\\", introducing the popular characters \\"shipmate Kristiansen and ship's engineer T√∏nnesen\\". In 1936 he married teacher Signe Hangeland. World War II During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany Hougen participated in resistance work. He was a member of Arne Laudal's organization, while working at the Price Police in Kristansand. He was arrested in December 1942, and transferred to the Grini concentration camp in January 1943, being incarcerated at Grini for two years until January 1945. Six of the members of Laudal's organization were later sentenced to death and shot at Trandum in May 1944. While being at Grini, he was placed at the \\"death cell\\" called \\"\\" for a period, and later as ordinary camp prioner. In the prisoner's documentary book on Grini () Hougen wrote a chapter about the life at \\"Fallskjermen\\", including a list of those prisoners who were brought out to be shot. Post-war career Hougen was a reporter for NRK when King Haakon VII returned to Oslo 7 June 1945. He later co-chaired the first large-scale charity fund-rasing campaigns in Norwegian radio. The institution Nasjonalhjelpen received more than . Later the Norwegian Radium Hospital was subject to similar fund-raising. After a short period in Oslo Hougen started working for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation's district office in his home city Kristiansand. From 1967 he was leader of the Kristiansand branch () until his retirement in 1976, when he was succeeded by H√•kon Karlsen.NRK-historia i Tr√∏ndelag. 2000 NRK (August 28).

The population was 1,788 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Albuquerque Metropolitan Statistical Area. The CDP is named after the pueblo at its center. Among Pueblo members, it is known as . Geography Jemez Pueblo is located at (35.610435, -106.727509). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land. Demographics It seems that a significant part of the Jemez Pueblo population originates from the surviving remnant of the Pecos Pueblo population who fled to Jemez Pueblo in 1838. The Jemez speak a Kiowa‚ÄìTanoan language also known as Jemez or Towa. As of the census of 2000, there were 1,953 people, 467 households, and 415 families residing in the CDP. The population density was 957.0 people per square mile (369.6/km2). There were 499 housing units at an average density of 244.5 per square mile (94.4/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 0.41% White, 99.13% Native American, 0.31% from other races, and 0.15% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.95% of the population. There were 467 households, out of which 39.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 39.2% were married couples living together, 35.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 11.1% were non-families. 9.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 2.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 4.18 and the average family size was 4.45. In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 35.0% under the age of 18, 11.1% from 18 to 24, 28.8% from 25 to 44, 18.4% from 45 to 64, and 6.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 28 years. For every 100 females, there were 94.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.9 males. The median income for a household in the CDP was $28,889, and the median income for a family was $30,880. Males had a median income of $20,964 versus $17,262 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $8,045. About 27.2% of families and 25.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 27.1% of those under age 18 and 34.6% of those age 65 or over. Jemez runners As much as 70% of the 1,890 Jemez people were living on their reservation lands in the early 1970s. Though by then an increasing number were switching to wage-earning work rather than agriculture, the residents continued to raise chile peppers, corn, and wheat, to speak their native language, and to maintain customary practices. Running, an old Jemez pastime and ceremonial activity, grew even more popular than it had been before World War II. Prior to the advent of television at Jemez, tales of running feats had been a major form of entertainment on winter nights. Races continued to hold their ceremonial place as the years passed, their purpose being to assist the movement of the sun and moon or to hasten the growth of crops, for example. At the same time, they became a popular secular sport. The year 1959 saw the first annual Jemez All-Indian Track and Field Meet, won by runners from Jemez seven times in the first ten years. A Jemez runner, Steve Gachupin, won the Pikes Peak Marathon six times, setting a record in 1968 by reaching the top in just 2 hours, 14 minutes, 56 seconds.Sando, Joe S., Nee Hemish: A History of Jemez Pueblo, Clear Light Publishing, Santa Fe, New Mexico, 2008 p. 169  Notable people  * Cliff Fragua, Jemez sculptor * Benny Shendo, member of the New Mexico Senate * Mary Ellen Toya, (1934‚Äì1990), artist * Evelyn M.

Life Born in Budapest, L√°ng studied composition there from 1950 to 1958 at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music, first with J√°nos Viski and later with Ferenc Szab√≥ . After graduating, he worked as a freelance composer until 1966 . From 1966 to 1984 he was Musical Adviser to the State Puppet Theatre, and in 1973 he joined the staff of the chamber music branch of the Liszt Academy. He also held guest lectureships at the University of Colorado in 1973, CNM in Mexico City in 1987, and the University of New Mexico in 1988 . He served as Secretary General of the Association of Hungarian Musicians from 1978‚Äì90, was a member of the Executive Committees of the International Society for Contemporary Music and the International Music Council (UNESCO) in 1984‚Äì87 and 1989‚Äì93, respectively . He has twice been awarded the Erkel Prize (in 1968 and 1975), was made Artist of Merit in 1985, and has won the Bart√≥k-P√°sztori Prize in 1994 . Musical style In his early mature works, L√°ng adopted the serial techniques that had become fashionable in the early 1960s, showing the influence of Boulez and Schoenberg, but still managing a clever and effective synthesis of these styles with traditional Hungarian elements derived from Bart√≥k in all areas: melody, harmony, rhythm, and texture‚Äîa synthesis perhaps best demonstrated in his Variations and Allegro (1965), which is an arrangement of an earlier symphony . His music from this period is marked by an absorption with the theatre, even in chamber and solo instrumental works, such as Monodia for clarinet, which is intended for stage or concert performance (Boronkay and Willson 2001). Other important works from the sixties are the first two Wind Quintets (1963 and 1966), a ballet on Thomas Mann's Mario and the Magician (1962), and a Chamber Cantata to words by Attila J√≥zsef (1962) . Another feature of L√°ng‚Äôs style is the use of cyclic form, and his later music tends to consist of sequences of short movements constructed from small motifs, which he calls \\"micro-organisms\\". These traits are found, for example, in his Second Wind Quintet of 1966 and Third String Quartet of 1978 (Boronkay and Willson 2001). The movements in such works are often linked by improvisatory solo interludes, as in the Second String Quartet of 1966 . Although L√°ng also worked briefly with electronic music as early as 1974 (Surface Metamorphoses), he turned seriously to this medium beginning only in the late 1990s, for example Esteled√©s (Nightfall, 1997), which uses live electronics to manipulate sounds of a trumpet and Korean bell . More recent works with electronics are the Capriccio metronomico for tape (2001), and the Third Chamber Cantata, \\"No Man Is an Island\\", to words of John Donne (2001), for soprano, five instruments, and tape .

Development The 600 Series were seagoing submarines, though designated as coastal-type submarines, built for service in the Mediterranean Sea. They were built to conform to the interwar naval treaties arising from the 1922 Washington and 1930 London conferences, which placed restrictions on the number and size of warships of various types that nations could build.Bagnasco p. 38 The coastal submarine was limited to a 600-ton surface displacement, though there was no limit placed on the numbers of these vessels that could be built. During this period France was involved in a rivalry with Italy in the Mediterranean, leading to a naval arms race. France took an early lead, but later Italian submarine construction had overtaken that of France. The French 600 series, and the later 630 series, was equivalent to the Italian 600 Series, the , and the German Type VII U-boat. General characteristics The 600s had a surface displacement just above 600 tons; the earliest vessels displaced 609 tons while the last built were 651 tons. They had an endurance of at , with a submerged speed of . Their armament was six to seven torpedo tubes (three forward, two midships, and one or two aft) with an outfit of 9‚Äì13 torpedoes. As with all French submarines of this period, the midships torpedo tubes were fitted externally in trainable mounts. They had a single to gun, and one to two 8 mm machine guns, and were manned by crews of 41 officers and enlisted. Construction history The first 600s were ordered in 1923. The French Navy was content to leave the design features for the boats to the builders, after laying down the specifications. Thus the 12 boats of the series were in three distinct classes, according to the design bureau and shipyard. The subsequent 630 Series were designed and built in the same way, resulting in 16 boats in a further three classes. * : a class of four submarines, built to a Loire-Simonot design. They were ordered in 1925 and completed in 1927. * : a class of four submarines, built to a Normand-Fenaux design.

The 600/630 Series was succeeded by the , an Admiralty design based on the 630 specification, and which sought to increase standardization.Conway p. 275  War service  The 600/630 Series submarines served with the Marine Nationale and with the Free French during World War II in a full range of front-line duties and missions. Of the 26 boats that served in World War II (two were lost in the pre-war period) 17 were lost.

Since graduating from RADA in 1961 (having won the Silver Medal for that year) he has acted in numerous film, television and stage productions, including twenty-seven plays in Shakespeare's canon and prominent guest roles in two Doctor Who serials. With Michael Croft he was a founder member of the National Youth Theatre. Much of his directing work has been for that organisation; he has directed also at the Regent's Park Open Air Theatre and a number of other theatres in London. He wrote and narrated a series of non- fiction audio books, including Shakespeare His Life and Work, which won the 2001 Benjamin Franklin AwardBenjamin Franklin Award for best audio non-fiction book. Early career Weston was educated at Alleyn's School, Dulwich, during the time that Michael Croft, founder of the National Youth Theatre, was there creating drama of a very high standard. In 1956 Croft directed a school production of Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 2, which, when revived as a NYT production at the Toynbee Hall Theatre the following year, attracted the attention of the national press. Weston played Falstaff, a character singled out by The Times in its praise of the play's comedy. In August 1960 Weston played Mark Antony in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar at the Queen's Theatre, Shaftesbury Avenue. Directed by Croft and given in modern dress, this was only the second appearance by the company of the NYT in London's West End. John Shrapnel played Caesar, Neil Stacy Brutus and Alan Allkins Cassius. The play was judged a \\"youthful success\\" by the theatre critic of The Times; Weston's performance was said to have successfully caught an opportunist spirit effectually hidden by a rough charm. The Times was more muted in its praise of the Electra and Oedipus Rex of Sophocles in a double bill put on by RADA at its Vanbrugh Theatre, Bloomsbury in February 1961. Weston played Creon in Oedipus Rex; his bluff characterisation was described as strongly supportive. Weston's first television appearance was as Romeo in a production for schools of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet; Jane Asher played Juliet. Weston later appeared in the serial Warriors' Gate in the 1981 season of Doctor Who in the pivotal role of the time-sensitive Biroc. }} Writing In 2011 Weston published Covering McKellen: An Understudy's Tale, a memoir of the year he spent as Ian McKellen's understudy in the Royal Shakespeare Company's tour of King Lear directed by Sir Trevor Nunn. In 2014 Weston published Covering Shakespeare: An Actor's Saga of Near Misses and Dogged Endurance, a memoir of his experiences performing in productions of Shakespeare's plays.

They average in length, which is extremely large as most springtails don‚Äôt grow past 1 millimetre. The specific name cincta means \\"belted\\" and refers to the distinctive colouration of the third abdominal segment. Description Springtails are small, wingless relatives of insects and typically have six abdominal segments, a tubular appendage projecting ventrally from the first abdominal segment, and a forked, tail-like appendage, the furcula, folded under the last abdominal segment, with which the animal can flip itself into the air. Members of the genus Orchesella have six antennal segments. Orchesella cincta reaches about in length and has a distinctively pigmented third abdominal segment and a dark third antennal segment. In contrast, the posterior part of the second abdominal segment and the distal part of the second antennal segments are white. The fifth and sixth antennal segments are brown, but otherwise the colouring of antennae and abdomen are variable, ranging from reddish-brown through various shades of brown to blackish. The body is thickly clad with hairs. There is a tendency for the antennae to be of unequal length, perhaps because of damage to the antennae during the developmental stages. Distribution Orchesella cincta is found in Western Europe and Canada. It is known from Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, France and the British Isles. It is one of the most common species in the British Isles where it is known from multiple locations in Scotland, England, Wales and Ireland. It is also common on Saint Helena in the mid-Atlantic, having presumably been introduced accidentally with plant material. This species lives in soil and among leaf litter in woodland. In the laboratory it can be maintained on twigs covered with green algae. Ecology Springtails moult throughout their life and in this species, feeding and reproductive instars alternate. When circumstances are adverse (dry conditions, low temperatures), the reproductive phases can be postponed until conditions improve, at which time the start of reproductive activity is synchronised across the population; this is a successful strategy, the population surge allowing this species to make the most of the available resources. Orchesella cincta has a high metabolic rate and a high fertility rate and is more mobile than many species; it is more likely to spread into new habitats such as the foliage of plants and crevices in trees.

It tells the story of the kitten born on a blue moon, whose destiny was to bring the song of the river, with its message of how things turn blue, war, and peace, to the inhabitants of Castle Town.The Newbery & Caldecott Awards: a guide to the medal and honor books by the Association for Library Service to Children, page 63 The book, illustrated by Janice Holland, was first published in 1949, and was a Newbery Honor recipient in 1950. According to the author's note at the end, the book was inspired by Coblentz's visit to Castleton, Vermont in 1946, with her husband, who was interested in seeing a nearby wind turbine then being used to generate electricity. Librarian Hulda Cole told her of a local girl who had made an embroidered carpet that hung in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Among its motifs, inspired by the natural world of its creator, was a blue cat. Coblentz, a Vermont native, drew on real people from the town's history to tell the story of the blue cat's adventures. Plot summary In the early 1830s, in a small town in Vermont, a blue kitten is born. Every kitten must find a hearth, but a blue kitten has the hardest time of all, for he must learn the river's song and then teach it to the keeper of that hearth. His mother teaches him not to listen to the river, but eventually he cannot help but hear the river talking to him, learns the song and seeks his fortune. He first meets a barn cat, whom he ignores, and a girl who slams the door in his face. His first home is with pewterer Ebenezer Southmayd. Southmayd is old and has given up making his most beautiful work to turn out cheap, shiny trade items. Singing the river's song, the kitten inspires Ebenezer to make one beautiful, perfect teapot according to the old formula. Alas, the pewterer drops dead when it is finished, and the blue kitten must find a new hearth. Next he meets a weaver, John Gilroy. Two women want him to weave fine linen, but he is contracted to make salt-and-pepper cloth for Arunah Hyde of the Mansion House. He accepts the job, inspired in part by the river's song. Hyde shows up, angry and in a hurry, and Gilroy returns to the more profitable work and turns the kitten outside. As his stagecoach is tearing off in a hurry, Hyde scoops up the kitten. At the Mansion House, Hyde is constantly shouting at people to make more money‚Äîbut he also plies the blue kitten with rich cream and delicious salmon, until he grows into a blue cat. Singing the river's song to Hyde, he finds that Hyde has his own song, a dark song of progress and industry and power‚Äîand a plan to decorate the Mansion House's front window with a lovely stuffed blue cat. He escapes, but falls ill and is rescued by the very barn cat he ignored on his first visit. She cares for him along with her own yellow kittens. He recovers, but has forgotten the song. Come spring, he finds the town possessed by Arunah's song. In the church he meets the carpenter Thomas Royal Dake, who has it in mind to build a truly beautiful pulpit, but has been told by the building committee to do it more cheaply. Dake, it turns out, knows the river's song, and the cat relearns it from him. The blue cat remains with Dake through the building of the pulpit in white pine and cherry. Then he returns to Zeruah Guernsey, the sad girl on the farm, and to his friend the barn cat. Zeruah is lonely and sad, and believes she is ugly. She listens to the river's song, but makes no move to sing it for some time. Finally she puts aside her sadness and begins work on an embroidered carpet. Into the carpet she puts flowers from the woods and from her dead mother's garden, her father's favorite white rooster. She embroiders the blue cat into the carpet, and he realizes what he must do to thank his friend the barn cat. One by one, he brings her kittens into the house for Zeruah to add to the carpet. Zeruah's carpet becomes a legend in the town, and many people stop by to see it. The blue cat sings to them, and gradually Arunah Hyde's song loses its power as the townspeople rediscover the importance of creating \\"beauty and peace and content.\\" The River's Song \\"Sing your own song, said the river, \\"Sing your own song. \\"Out of yesterday song comes. It goes into tomorrow, Sing your own song. \\"With your life fashion beauty, This too is the song. Riches will pass and power. Beauty remains.

The Hatch-Waxman Act was created to '\\"strike a balance between two competing policy interests: # inducing pioneering research and development of new drugs and # enabling competitors to bring low-cost, generic copies of those drugs to market'\\".Caraco Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Ltd., 527 F.3d 1278, 1282 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (internal citations omitted). The Orange Book identifies drug products approved on the basis of safety and effectiveness by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The publication does not include drugs on the market approved only on the basis of safety (covered by the ongoing Drug Efficacy Study Implementation [DESI] review [e.g., Donnatal Tablets and Librax Capsules] or pre-1938 drugs [e.g., Phenobarbital Tablets]). The main criterion for the inclusion of any product is that the product is the subject of an application with an effective approval that has not been withdrawn for safety or efficacy reasons. Inclusion of products on the List is independent of any current regulatory action through administrative or judicial means against a drug product. In addition, the Orange Book contains therapeutic equivalence evaluations (2 character rating codes) for approved multisource prescription drug products (generic drugs). These evaluations have been prepared to serve as public information and advice to state health agencies, prescribers, and pharmacists to promote public education in the area of drug product selection and to foster containment of health care costs.Orange Book preface Therapeutic equivalence evaluations in this publication are not official FDA actions affecting the legal status of products under the Act. Finally, the Orange Book lists patents that are purported to protect each drug. Patent listings and use codes are provided by the drug application owner, and the FDA is obliged to list them. In order for a generic drug manufacturer to win approval of a drug under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the generic manufacturer must certify that they will not launch their generic until after the expiration of the Orange Book- listed patent, or that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or that the generic product will not infringe the listed patent. The Orange Book does not list biological products such as vaccines. These are listed in later-enacted Lists of Licensed Biological Products with Reference Product Exclusivity and Biosimilarity or Interchangeability Evaluations, commonly known as the Purple Book.

It was one of 325 similar locomotives purchased by the railroad from 1901 to 1908 and designated the R-1 class. C&NW; owned more R-1s than any other steam locomotive class. Although principally used for fast freight, the R-1 class also was used for slower passenger service and occasional switching over the North Western's extensive system, which at its peak extended through nine states from Illinois to Wyoming. When new, it was large, modern power, and required strengthening and enlarging turntables, engine houses, and bridges wherever used. #1385 was retired in 1956 and was used to thaw out ore cars during severe winters. The locomotive was then purchased by the Historical Society of Milwaukee in 1961 for $2600. The society purchased an abandoned line in North Freedom, Wisconsin, from the C&NW; in 1963, moved #1385 there and the society changed its name to Mid- Continent Railway Museum. The locomotive was in service for most of the 1980s and 1990s, doing excursions over large parts of the C&NW; system, but was shopped for major boiler work in 1998.

He had been living in a trailer with two employees of the hotel where the murders took place, David Starling and Orval Edwards. Starling was described as having had prior knowledge of Pixley's violent tendencies.. Murders On the night of August 5/6, 1964, Pixley broke into a room of the Wort Motor Hotel in Jackson, Wyoming, occupied by the family of Illinois Circuit Court Judge Robert McAuliffe, who were on vacation. McAuliffe and his wife were elsewhere in the hotel taking in a show. When they returned to their room, they found Pixley lying on the floor. He appeared to be drunk, but may have been feigning; McAuliffe said at the trial he had not smelled alcohol. McAuliffe grabbed Pixley and pinned him to the floor. Police officer James Jensen heard Mrs. McAuliffe screaming and rushed to the scene, where McAuliffe shouted \\"My God, this man has killed my babies.\\" Their older daughters, Debbie, 12, and Cindy, 8 lay dead in their beds. The girls had been sexually assaulted, Debbie had been bludgeoned with a rock, and Cindy beaten and strangled. The youngest child, six-year-old Susan, was unharmed. Initially described as asleep during the crime, she may actually have witnessed the assault on her sisters. Pixley had apparently climbed a stack of wood and scaled the rear wall of the hotel, removing a screen to get in at the window. As Pixley was taken by police from the hotel, a crowd outside called for him to be lynched. He was taken to a jail in another town and then to the Wyoming State Penitentiary for better security. The McAuliffe sisters were buried together in a single casket. Their parents later filed suit against the hotel in order to pay for the surviving child's psychiatric treatment. Initially, Pixley only told police \\"I didn't do it.\\"Pixley Facing Murder Charges in Wyoming. In The Bend, Oregon Bulletin, August 8, 1964. Hotel employee Richard Southern testified that Pixley cited his Native American heritage in explaining why he \\"couldn't\\" have done such a thing.\\"I'm an Indian--I couldn't have done that.\\" Oregon Man Being Tried in Wyoming in the Eugene Register- Guard, February 3, 1965. Later, Pixley asked to make a statement, and was examined using sodium pentothal interviews. He said he remembered drinking earlier in the evening, but could not remember entering the hotel or killing the girls. His court-appointed attorney, Robert Hufsmith, added that Pixley remembered being in the company of another person earlier that evening, but that his mind was \\"blank since he left that person.\\"Accused Murderer Says Memory Blank, in the Washington, NC Morning Star-News, August 8, 1964. Pixley was examined by Dr. William Karn, Jr. of the Wyoming State Hospital, who pronounced him sane, but an \\"incurable sociopath\\" at the trial, adding that \\"it meant a lot more to Pixley to kill the girls while they were awake.\\" At this, Judge McAuliffe got up from his seat and attempted to assault Pixley before being restrained.Court Decision: Death For Pixley. In the Deseret News, February 4, 1965. Pixley was tried and sentenced to death, laughing when the execution date was announced. Although an appeal was filed to change his sentence to life imprisonment, he said he did not want an appeal.. He was executed in the Wyoming gas chamber on December 10, 1965. He took the longest time to die of any person ever executed in the Wyoming gas chamber. Until the execution of Mark Hopkinson in 1992, Pixley was the last person to be put to death in Wyoming. According to genealogical research, Robert and Betty McAuliffe divorced sometime after the murders. McAuliffe remarried Charlotte Olivia Moon Branch and had a son, Jon David McAuliffe, born on 1/21/1974 in Chicago. He died April 1, 1998, of a heart attack.Genealogical research on the McAuliffe-Dowd families , page found 2011-07-02.[ McAuliffe genealogy at City- Net, page found 2015-03-21.

The river then flows southwards and ends at √òyeren. The river has at this point run for around and has dropped around . The river is part of the Oslomarkavassdragene. The northern part of Nitelva runs between Hakadal and is called Hakadalselva. The journey to √òyeren begins with rapids, before slowing to a broad meandering river through Nittedal. The last kilometres of the river run through Skedsmo and R√¶lingen municipalities, first as a scenic part of Lillestr√∏m city and √òvre R√¶lingen with roads on both banks, passing through an industrialised area before ending at the delta in the north of √òyeren in R√¶lingen. Nitelva and its banks make up a varied and fertile belt through forests, agricultural landscapes and buildings. The river was originally named Nitja. The meaning of the name is unknown, but it may come from the word net, in the sense of fishing net. It may also come from the verb hnita, which means \\"to clash\\" (meaning waves that clash together). The river is an important part of the local environment, and the watercourse has been used for timber mills, power, and factories. Many places along the Nitelva have remains of these activities, and their influence is still seen in place names. The river is well known for sports fishing. Up until Rotnesfossen can be found many of Norway's freshwater fish, and 21 species are recorded. Among these are northern pike, zander, perch and carp. To the north of the watercourse can also be found brown trout. Along the river, one can also find a rich and varied animal, bird and plant life, and it has an important ecological function as a habitat and dispersal corridor for several species. Here you can experience both the dense spruce forests, lush deciduous forests, marshes, flower beds, juncus and water plants. The animal and bird species along the river include beaver, grey heron and deer. Because of its biological diversity, Nitelva is a protected waterway, and in the lower part of the river, there are two nature reserves; S√∏rumsneset and Nordre √òyeren nature reserve.

The extent of Kathmandu city today across the Kathmandu Valley  Ancient Kathmandu valley  Archaeological explorations indicate that Kathmandu and the two other sister towns in the valley were the oldest towns and are traced to the period between 167 BC and 1 AD. Excavations conducted at Hadigaon and Lubhu in southern part of the valley, in Kathmandu, have unearthed brick walls and Stone Age tools. In 1992, workers digging a trench for the foundation of a house in Maligaon in Eastern Kathmandu discovered a life size (171 x 49 cm) standing male figure carved in pale sandstone, clearly made in the Kushan style. The sculpture was donated by an early Licchavi or pre-Licchavi monarch, named Jaya Varman with an inscription on the pedestal. Although the identity of the figure is contested, it is the authors' opinion that it is likely Jaya Varman himself who is portrayed. It is the oldest known inscription from the Kathmandu Valley. \\"The inscription on this sculpture, clearly dated to samvat 107, most likely corresponding to AD 185, provides this previously missing evidence, and pushes back the epigraphical documentation of royal rule in the Kathmandu valley nearly three hundred years.\\"Talmot and Alsop (2001, and a later revision). The geological setting of the valley points to the existence of a lake near Chobar gorge on the Bagmati River, below the present Pashupatinath Temple, which was a pilgrimage place during the period of the Buddha. This lake is said to have been drained by Manjushree Bodhisattva, a Buddhist saint, by cutting open an outlet in the southern rim of the valley. As a result, the valley that was created was fertile and people started cultivating here and building their homes here. As the valley grew, Manjushree is said to have worshipped Swayambhu on the hillock where the present Swayambhu temple is located. He also founded the city of Manjupatan, which today lies within the present Kathmandu Metropolitan area, located between Swayambu and Gujeswari near the airport. He even declared his disciple Dharmakarma as the ruler of that city. The reign of Abhir dynasty of eighth rulers and the Kiratis said to be originally of the northeastern hill region of India (700 BC). Their succession of 29 rulers reigned here until the Lichhavis came into power. Four stupas around the city of Patan, near Kendra Hiranyavarna Mahavihara (called \\"Patukodon\\"), far away from Kathmandu, is said to have been erected by Charumati, attests to the ancient history. Licchavi Kingdom (400‚Äì750) Bagmati River During the reign of the Licchavi (clan) (400‚Äì750 A.D.), two adjoining settlements, Yambu or Thahne (‚ÄòYambu‚Äô in Nepal Bhasa means the field of Kathmandu and Thahne means higher ground that lies to the north side also called ‚Äúnorthern land\\") and Yangal/Kwone (‚ÄòYangal‚Äô in Nepal Bhasa means the depressed area of Kathmandu, Kwone also means ‚Äúsouthern land\\") formed Kathmandu, also known as Koligram. Koligram is believed to be settlement of Koliyas, some of whom migrated to Kathmandu valley after Mahajanapada era. Yambu is the area north of present-day Makhan Tole, next to the Durbar Square. The southern sector, called Yangal, is also known as Dakshin Koligram; and a neighborhood by this name (Yengal) exists in the city today. The Licchavi king Gunakamadeva founded a city in between these two settlements on the bank of Bishnumati river called Kantipur. The city was formed in the shape of a Chandrahrasa (Manjushri's sword) mentioned in Swayambhu Purana, which was used to drain Nagdaha to create the Kathmandu valley and fortified with 8 barracks which were guarded by Ajimas. According to folklore, Gunakamadeva dreamt of being asked to found a city by Laxmi (or Kanti), so the city was formed in her name, Kantipur. According to Nepal Sambat, the city is believed to have been founded on the auspicious date of Yenya Punhi, with the founding stone laid by Gunakamadeva at Maru Tole, which is still present. In order to appease relations between the citizens of Yembu and Yengal, the king is believed to have started a festival where the Majipa Lakhey dance of Kone (Yengal) and Pulukishi dance of Yembu (Thahne) were performed together along the main road of the newly formed city connecting the two settlements (now called Gunakamadeva Marg). The festival is still celebrated as Yenya or Indra Jatra today but the main focus of the festival has shifted to Indra and Kumari over a long period of time. Bhimsen, the Nepalese god of merchants A marketplace was formed at the center of city in a circular shape (Chakrakar) according to Tantric traditions. A temple, dedicated to Bhimsen, the god of merchants, was built at the center of Bhimsenthan to attract merchants. However, very few trade passed through the Himalayas between India and China during this period, and the founding of this fortified city provided a secure trading point, promoting trade between the two markets and boosting the economy of the city. This also had a profound effect on the culture of the city, and brought a diversity of ethnicities, religions and cultures together harmoniously. The Licchavi were in Bihar during the Mahajanapada era and Licchavi inscriptions have been found in Sanskrit with their particular script closely related to official Gupta scripts. The Lichhavi, having lost their political fortune in India, came to Nepal, attacking and defeating the last Kirat King Gasti. There were 48 Licchavi rulers, including Mana Deva I, who ruled from 464 and had been referred to as their greatest ruler. A connoisseur of art and architecture, he introduced the Pagoda roofed architecture, erected exquisite sculptures and built the temples of Changunarayan, Vishabjynarayan, Sikhomanarayan and Ichabgunarayan. The reclining Vishnu of Budhanilkantha, the gilded roof of the Pashupatinath Temple, the struts of Hanuman Dhoka and the Basantapur Tower, the Uku Bahal in Patan, and the Indreshwar Mhadev Temple at Panauti are all credited to Mana Deva. 7th to 8th century The famous Chinese Buddhist monk, Xuanzang (Wade-Giles: Hs√ºan-tsang), spent about two years between 637 and 642 CE at the great university of Nalanda, which is almost directly south of Nepal. It is not certain that he actually visited Nepal, but he left a fascinating account of it, the capital city which we know as Kathmandu, and its king, which, presumably, dates from this period: > \\"The country is about 4000 li in circuit, and is situated among the Snowy > Mountains. The capital city is about 20 li round [approx 8 km]. Mountains > and valleys are joined together in an unbroken succession. . . . There are > believers and heretics mixed together. The sa·πÖgh√¢r√¢mas [Buddhist monasteries > or temples] and D√™va [Hindu] temples are closely joined. There are about > 2000 priests, who study both the Great [Mahayana] and Little [Hinayana] > Vehicles. The number of heretics and sectaries of different sorts is > uncertain. The king is a Kshattriya, and belongs to the family of the > Licchavas. His mind is well-informed, and he is pure and dignified in > character. He has a sincere faith in the law of Buddha. Lately there was a > king called A·πÅ≈õuvarman (An-chu-fa-mo), who was distinguished for his > learning and ingenuity. He himself composed a work on \\"sounds\\" [a Sanskrit > grammar](≈öabdavidy√¢); he esteemed learning and respected virtue, and his > reputation was spread everywhere. To the south-east of the capital is a > little stream and a lake. If we fling fire into it, flames immediately > arise; other things take fire if thrown in it, and change their > character.Beal (1884), Vol. II, pp. 80‚Äì81. The Chinese sent Princess Wencheng to marry the Tibetan king in 641 CE. Following this, the Chinese Emperor Taizong of Tang sent an envoy via Tibet to the great Indian Emperor Harsha. Another larger mission under Wang Xuance sent in 647-8 was robbed of the gifts they were carrying; some of the emissaries were killed, others put in prison. Narendradeva sent 7,000 troops with their allies, the Tibetans, attacked Kanauj, the Gupta capital, captured the usurper, Arjuna, and his family, and sent them as a captives to China.Shaha (1992), p. 20. This was the last known official contact between China and India until the 13th centurySnellgove (1987), Vol. II, pp. 371. and so, the following account of Nepal from the Tang Annals, most probably dates to information brought back about that time: > \\"Their king, Narendadeva, is adorned with genuine pearls, with rock-crystal, > with mother of pearl, with coral and amber; he wears earrings of gold and > pendants of jade, and he wears a small Buddha-image as an amulet. He sits on > a lion-throne and inside the audience-hall where flowers and perfumes are > scattered.

In the middle of the palace [BhadrƒÅdhivƒÅsa] there is a seven-story > tower, its roofs covered with copper tiles. The balustrades and railings, > the columns and the beams, all are ornamented with precious stones. On the > four corners of (the roofs of) the tower there are fixed copper pipes at the > end of which are golden dragon spouts. The water from above flows down the > pipes and comes out from the mouths of the dragons like so many natural > fountains.\\"Snellgove (1987), Vol. II, pp. 372. The Tang Annals also include the information that Narendradeva's father lost his throne to his elder brother and sought refuge in Tibet. The Tibetans re- established him on his throne and \\"that is how he became subject to Tibet.\\"Snellgove (1987), Vol. II, p. 372. Thomas Watters says that the Shih- ka-fang-chih (Pinyin: Shiga fangzhi), 'A record of the country of Sakya(muni),' which is dated 650 CE,Nanjio (1904‚Äì5) No. 1470 reports that there was at the capital, \\"a large building in seven stories, above high and 80 paces in circumference, the upper part of which accommodated 10000 [or, preferably, \\"a myriad\\"] persons; the chambers of this building had exquisite carvings, and were adorned with precious stones.\\" There also was a Buddhist monastery \\"in several stories and of fantastic shapes\\" on a hill more than 10 li [approx] south of the capital.\\"Watters (1923), Vol. II, pp. 84‚Äì85. A Buddhist legend says Narendradeva retired to a monastery. He was followed by ≈öivadeva II who, although he was Hindu, was supportive of Mahayana Buddhism. Seven inscriptions from his reign have survived covering the period from 685 to 701 CE. His wife, Vatsadevƒ´, was the granddaughter of Aditiyasena, the King of the Magadha. He was succeeded by his son, Jayadeva II, who married the daughter of the King of the Gau·∏ça region, in northeastern India, and whose inscriptions range from 713 to 733. These are followed by a series of inscriptions from a number of rather poorly known Licchavi rulers which range up to 879 CE, when King RƒÅghadeva ascended the throne.Shaha (1992), pp. 21‚Äì22. 750‚Äì1200 Kathmandu was planned in the shape of Manjushree's sword with the tip positioned to north and the base to the south The period 750‚Äì1200 is considered as a transitional kingdom in power in Kathmandu Valley, though concrete verifiable records are not available. According to custom, however, in the late 900s, Kathmandu was established by the King Gunakama Deva at the banks of Bishnumati river whose southern limit was marked by the confluence of the Bagmati River and Bishnumati River in a place called Teku Dovan. The pre- existing settlements of Yambu and Yangal were merged into the Kantipur city. The town was planned in the shape of Manjushree's sword with the tip positioned to north and the base to the south, with the perimeter of Kathmandu defined by building temples of the eight mother goddesses (Ajima); which still exist today. The important structures built in Kathmandu during this period were the Kasthamandap, amidst temples and narrow streets lined with multi- storey houses around the Durbar Square, with the old royal palace complex occupying the center stage. Thanhiti, an upper fountain, marked the southern section. Similar old water spouts, seen at several locations in the city, were a source of drinking water to the inhabitants residing in the vicinity. Malla Dynasty (1200‚Äì1768) Khasa Mall kings ruled in western Nepal during 1100‚Äì1484. However, Arimalla, first monarch of the Malla Dynasty, ruled in Kathmandu Valley from 1200 to 1216. Other notable rulers of the Malla dynasty were Jayasthitimalla who ruled as king of united Malla kingdom from 1382 to 1395 and Yakshamalla reigned from 1428 to 1482 at the height of united Malla kingdom. The Malla dynasty period (1200‚Äì1768) witnessed further boost in enhancing the cultural heritage of Kathmandu by building pagodas, houses decorated with carved windows, exquisite open-air shrines and courtyards filled with brilliant sculptures. Kathmandu became a larger city and as observed by Father Giuseppe, a Capuchin missionary, in the 1760s, 'Catmandu' contained about 18,000 houses. During the 14th century, the dynasty was threatened and Kathmandu was subject to many attacks by outside invaders. In 1312, the Khasa king Ripumalla lead a raid in the Kathmandu Valley and in 1345‚Äì46 Sultan Shams ud-din Ilyas of Bengal invaded the city, and the Mughals left long lasting damage, destroying many earlier buildings and settlements which led to widespread reconstruction of the city. In 1484, the Malla kingdom divided into the three kingdoms of Kathmandu, Bhadgaon, and Patan. Early modern Nepal began its evolution in the 16th century with the founding of the House of Gorkha by Dravya Shah in 1559. During the rule of the Gorkhas there was further frenzied activity in building up the city. Ram Shah of Gorkha reigned from 1606 to 1633 and started expanding the Gorkha kingdom. Kings such as Jitamitra Malla, King of Bhaktapur from 1673 to 1696 was noted in particular for his construction projects. In 1674, he built a Shikara-style Shiva temple with a gilded repousse mask of the God on each side in Bhaktapu. In 1682 he built, near the Durbar square, the two-storied Dharmasala Palace in which there is a golden Mahadeva. The palace was used by royalty until 1769 and today is a museum and part of the World Heritage Site on Durbar Square. To the east of this he erected the temple and statue of Narayana, along with the temples of Dattatrikasa and Pashupati. An inscription in 1678 states that he built the royal palace Thanathu Durbar, its gardens and courtyard. Jitamitra was also credited with restoring Kumari Chowk, the images of Astamatrikas and in 1690, donated two large copper kettledrums (nagara) or bells to his favourite deity, the goddess Taleju for the gilded roof of Taleju. He also contributed a finely carved wooden tympanum above the main entrance to the Mul Chowk and also erected many memorials in Bhaktapur. His son, Bhupatindra Malla replaced him after his death in 1696 and was equally as fascinated with architecture, and continued the development of the Dharmsala Palace, its 55 windows and gardens. 1769‚Äì1845 Balbhadra Kunwar, Gurkha commander of the Anglo-Nepalese War. After Jayayakshya Malla conquered lands that was far larger than what Nepal had been before him, he decided to create a confederation for his sons so that they could rule the nation more efficiently. The Malla confederacy, with more than one ruler overlooking the nation, was more stable than the monarchial rule before. So, the monarchs focussed more on trade, arts and literature than in developing the army. By the time Prithvi Narayan Shah had ascended to the throne of Gorkha in 1743. When Prithvi Narayan Shah first attacked Kirtipur, the combined army of Malla confederacy defeated him and killed Kalu Pandey, the Mul Kaji in the Battle of Kirtipur. Even after the conquest of Kirtipur and Kantipur in 1768 in the Battle of Kathmandu, the Malla confederacy fought from Bhaktapur, where, the rulers of all the three states of the Malla confederacy surrendered. By 1769 enabled Prithvi Narayan Shah, the king of Gorkha, to conquer the valley, forming the foundations for the modern Kingdom of Nepal. Finally Gorkha conquered Kathmandu and Patan, Bhadgaon, eastern Nepal, and western Nepal between 1768 and 1790. Prithvi Narayan Shah, the first king of united Nepal died in 1775. In 1767, a request to the British for help by the traditional valley kings under threat from Gorkha expansion resulted in an ill-equipped and ill-prepared expedition numbering 2,500 led by Captain Kinloch. The expedition was a disaster; the Gorkha army easily overpowered those who had not succumbed to malaria or desertion. This ineffectual British force provided the Gorkhas with firearms and filled them with suspicion, causing some to underestimate their future opponents. This conquest of the Kathmandu valley was only the beginning of an explosion of Gorkha power throughout the region. The Gorkha armies had overrun all of eastern Nepal by 1773. Gorkha forces had also annexed some western portions of Sikkim and in 1788 seized their then capital Rabdentse. In the west, all rulers as far as the Kali River had submitted or been replaced by 1790. Farther west still, the Kumaon region and its capital Almora had also succumbed to the Gorkhas. To the north however, aggressive raids into Tibet (concerning a long-standing dispute over trade and control of the mountain passes) forced the Chinese emperor in Peking to act. In 1792 he sent a huge army, expelling the Nepalese from Tibet to within of their capital at Kathmandu. Acting regent Bahadur Shah, (Prithvi Naryan's son), appealed to the British Governor-General of India for help. Anxious to avoid confrontation with the Chinese, the British sent Captain Kirkpatrick as mediator, but before he arrived the war with China had finished. The Nepalese were forced into signing a humiliating treaty revoking their trading privileges in Tibet and requiring them to pay tribute to Peking every five years. The Tibet affair had postponed a previously planned attack on the Garhwal Kingdom, but by 1803 Raja of Garhwal Pradyuman Shah had also been defeated. He was killed in the struggle in January 1804, and all his land annexed. Further west, general Amar Singh Thapa overran lands as far as the Kangra ‚Äì the strongest fort in the hill region ‚Äì and laid siege to it (although by 1809, Ranjit Singh the ruler of the Sikh state in the Punjab, had intervened and driven the Nepalese army east of the Sutlej river). The British were also expanding their sphere of influence. The recent acquisition of the Nawab of Awadh's lands by the British East India Company brought the region of Gorakhpur into the close proximity of the raja of Palpa ‚Äì the last remaining independent town within the Gorkha heartlands. Suspicion of the raja's collusion with the British led first to his imprisonment by the Gorkhas, then to his assassination. Bhimsen Thapa, Nepalese Prime Minister from 1806 to 1837, installed his own father as governor of Palpa, leading to serious border disputes between the two powers. These disputes arose because there was no fixed boundary separating the Gorkhas and the British. A border commission imposed on Nepal by the Governor-General failed to solve the problem. Gorkha raids into the flatlands of the Tarai, a much prized strip of fertile ground separating the Nepalese hill country from India, increased tensions ‚Äì the British felt their power in the region and their tenuous lines of communication between Calcutta and the northwest were under threat. Since there was no clear border, confrontation between the powers was inevitable. As a result of border tensions and ambitious expansionism conflict came to heads in the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814‚Äì1816 between the Kingdom of Nepal (now Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal) and the British East India Company. After the successful initial campaign by Ochterlony, however, the Kathmandu durbar failed to ratify the peace agreement signed on 28 November 1815. This reluctance to sign soon led to the second campaign. Unsurprisingly, Lord Moira placed Ochterlony in command of the 20,000 strong invasion force of Nepal. After the decisive Battle of Makwanpur on 28 February 1816 and the fall of the fort of Hariharpur, the Gurkhas were forced to surrender and as a result the Treaty of Sugauli was ratified on 4 March 1816. Nepal lost Sikkim, the territories of Kumaon and Garhwal, and most of the lands of the Tarai; the British East India Company would pay 200,000 rupees annually to compensate for the loss of income from the Tarai region. However, the Tarai lands had proved difficult to govern and some of them were returned to Nepal later in 1816 and the annual payments abolished. The Mechi river became the new eastern border and the Mahakali river the western boundary of Nepal. Kathmandu was also forced to accept a British Resident, a position that was loathed as it was seen as a symbol of its reduction to client status in relation to the British administration in Calcutta under the British Raj. Modern history (1846‚Äì1999) With the Shahs establishing their rule over the Gorkhas, dictatorship ensued, with Ranas becoming all powerful. Jang Bahadur Kunwar was the first Prime Minister in 1846 followed by succession of Rana prime ministers, which lasted till 1950. Rana rule from Kathmandu was mainly governance by a landed aristocracy, with the parliamentary government functioning only as a facade. Even though there was stability in the country, political and economic development was on the backburner with the Ranas adopting isolation of the country with absolute total control over domestic affairs. All this was possible because of support of the army. Buddha statue on street. Kathmandu. 1979 During all this period, Shahs as Monarchs were figurehead monarchs, while the real power rested with the Ranas. The Nepali Congress Party was founded in 1946, diplomatic relatshionship was established with USA and. In 1948 the country's first constitution, the Government of Nepal Act, was promulgated. But Prime Minister Padma Shamsher Rana resigned in the wake of opposition to the new constitution from conservative Ranas and Mohan Shamsher becomes prime minister; constitution is suspended. By 1950 Ranas fell into open conflict with King Tribhuvan as they suspected Nepali Congress Party's conspiracy against Rana power was instigated by the King. The king then sought and was granted asylum in India. at this stage, Government troops rebelled and over 140 Ranas joined the dissidents. During this period a Treaty of Peace and Friendship and Treaty of Trade and Commerce was signed with India. The 1934 Nepal‚ÄìBihar earthquake damaged many parts of the city. However, they were later rebuilt to their original form. From the 1980s, the city has witnessed a building boom with farmlands within the city limits getting converted into urban building developments with the old core area getting encircled by high-rise buildings of business houses, wide boulevards and upscale residential suburbs. However, in January 1951, the tide turned in favour of monarchy of Shahs, when the Ranas were forced to surrender all executive powers: financial management, appointment of government officials, and command of the armed forces to the Monarchy. Mohan Shamsher capitulated and King Tribhuvan was restored to the throne. Several Prime Minsires took executive control ending with the king assumin direct rule. Local elections to a municipal council were first held on September 9, 1953. Candidates nominated by the illegal Communist Party of Nepal got 50% of the total votes cast. Out of a total of 19 seats, six were won by communists, four by Nepali Congress, four by Praja Parisad, one by Gorkha Parishad and four by independents.Rawal, Bhim. The Communist Movement in Nepal: Origin and Development. Kathmandu: Accham-Kathmandu Contact Forum, 2007. p. 41-42. Amongst the elected communists was the chairman of the council, Janak Man Singh. However, his tenure became short. A jurisdictional dispute emerged between the municipal council and the national government. A no-confidence vote removed Singh from his office and the national government banned him from entering the municipal council office. Singh was arrested when attempting to enter the office, and was jailed.Levi, Werner. Politics in Nepal, published in Far Eastern Survey, Vol. 25, No. 3, (Mar., 1956), pp. 39‚Äì46 Following the death of King Tribhuvan in 1955, Mahendra assumed power.[15] During this period Nepal joined the United Nations, National Police Force was formed, In the 1950s many events occurred such as the signing of border treaty with China, the USSR opening an embassy at Kathmandu and the United States opening an embassy at Kathmandu in 1959. A new constitution was also promulgated in 1959, superseding Constitution of 1951. The first general elections were also held in 1956 with the Nepal Congress Party winning absolute majority; and the Tribhuvan University was founded. In December 1960, King Mahendra abolished the multiparty democracy and brought in the Panchayat Raj into force. This was fully controlled by the Monarchy.Kumar p.239 In 1962, King Mahendra adopted a new constitution, the third since 1951, and established the centrally controlled partyless council system of governance called panchayat. This system served as the institutional basis of the king's rule. The palace claimed it a democratic administration although it functioned only at the king's behest. It was then established at the village, district, and national levels. Even with successive changes in executive wing of government in Kathmandu and constitutional revisions, the absolute powers of the monarchy remained solid. Land Reorganization Act and Mulki Ain, new legal code, were also promulgated. Durbar Square in 1920 But political unrest simmered as the events testify: In 1963 after Emergency was lifted Panchayat elections were held and the National Guidance Council was formed. In 1965, the local government was reorganized. In 1971 a new trade and transit treaty was negotiated with India from Kathmandu. In 1972 King Mahedra died and was succeeded by King Birendra. Development regions were established under National Development Council.[15] But a fire in the same year burns down Singha Durbar, the seat of government. King Birendra was crowned in 1973. He soon thereafter launched the \\"Go to the Village\\". In the May 1980 referendum while reaffirming the status quo of the panchayat system, against the reintroduction of political parties and concurred continuation rule by the king. Elections in 1981 and 1986 were characterized by the lack of political programs. Political turmoil continued. Second election to Rastriya Panchayat were held in 1986; [15] In 1989, failure to renegotiate trade and transit treaties with India disrupted the economy. Following this in 1990 demonstrations for the restoration of democracy were held. On April 9, 1990, the King restored the multi-party democracy with due lifting of the ban on agitating political parties. Panchayat system was dissolved and an interim government made up of various parties and king's representatives was formed with promulgation of new constitution.Kumar p.242 Following restoration of multi-party democary, the first general elections to Parliament were held on May 12, 1991, under the new constitution. Nepali Congress won a narrow majority and G.P. Koirala became prime minister. But President of Nepali Congress and interim prime minister, K.P. Bhattarai, was defeated in the polls by the leader of CPN-UML, Madan Bhandari.Kumar p. 243 In 1992 Local elections were held and Nepali Congress won a majority of the seats. But in 1993 Madan Bhandari was killed in a mysterious car crash which resulted in violent demonstrations by communists to overthrow Koirala's government. During this year, devastating floods also killed hundreds.Kumar p. 248-49 Contemporary history (2000‚Äìpresent) The Narayanhiti Palace, where the royal massacre occurred In recent years, Kathmandu has experienced a turbulent history and political instability, marred by outbreaks of violence and protests, which have often caused considerable damage to buildings or caused loss of lives. On June 1, 2001, a gruesome royal massacre occurred when the Crown Prince Dipendra gunned down his immediate family consisting of his father King Birendra, his mother Queen Aishvarya, his brother and sister, and also five of his relatives at the Narayanhiti Royal Palace. He turned the gun on himself and died two days later. The reason for this massacre is shrouded in mystery but his love for the Rana family girl Devyani Rana, which was not acceptable to his parents, is conjectured as the reason for this massacre. Following this tragedy, King Gyanendra, brother of deceased King Birendra was crowned the king at the palace. The Tribhuvan Sadan where the massacre took place was subsequently demolished at the orders of the Queen mother. Demonstration in Kathmandu in April 2004 In April 2004, a mob of some 4,000 people, mainly youths, expressed anger at the killing of 12 Nepalese jobseekers in Iraq, and burned down and vandalised many buildings, including more than a dozen private employment agencies and the city's Jama Masjid Mosque. In summer 2008, Kathmandu reached global headlines when political protests capitulated and political protests have plagued the city ever since. In November 2009, protests by Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist ) rebels have continued, following the collapse of the Maoist-led government in May 2009, have demanded a referendum in parliament about the extent of presidential powers, and accusing the head of the army of opposing the integration of thousands of former Maoist rebels into the national army. The demonstrators blocked the entrances to the main government complex and caused traffic chaos, protesting with slogans such as \\"Down with the puppet government\\" and waving Maoist flags. Modern Kathmandu Due to the rising demand of luxury apartments many high rise complexes are being built. Kathmandu Metropolitan City office recently granted a construction license to over a thousand builders from within and outside the country to build residential complexes.

It is near the mouth of the Yaquina River, on the east side of Yaquina Bay, and is a drive from Newport. The Oregon Press Association, which became the Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association, was founded in Yaquina City in 1887. Name The city, the bay, and the river are all named for the Yaquina people, a small Native American tribe of Yakonan speakers who lived near the bay. History In the late 19th century, Yaquina City was the western terminus of the Oregon Pacific Railroad, linking the harbor there to Corvallis and Albany. Thomas Egenton Hogg, the rail line's chief promoter, and his Eastern financial backers believed that a steamship‚Äìrailroad combination using Yaquina Bay could compete successfully with the usual Columbia River route to Portland. The first train moved over the line in 1885, making connections at Yaquina City with a steamer to San Francisco. However, the Yaquina‚ÄìAlbany line and a partly completed extension from Albany toward the Cascade Range, became too expensive to continue. After the Oregon Pacific failed financially, it fell into receivership and went through 17 years of financial and legal complications before becoming a branch line of the Southern Pacific in 1907. In 1911, the city had a railroad station, a roundhouse and associated railroad shops, a bank, a three-story hotel, other commercial establishments, and many homes. As many as eight trains were needed on weekends to carry beach-goers from the Willamette Valley to Yaquina City and the steamer Yaquina, which carried them across the bay to Newport. However, Newport and nearby Toledo, more accessible by highway, grew larger over time while Yaquina City shrank. By the beginning World War II, Toledo was the western terminus of the rail line, and the tracks from there to Yaquina City were removed. Roughly 20 years later, the former seaport's population dropped to zero. Historian Edwin Culp writes: \\"Today one can drive along the bay from Newport to Toledo, pass through Yaquina City, and never know that such a town existed.\\" On August 21, 2017, Yaquina becomes the first place in the United States to witness totality of the solar eclipse.

Background and history First performed on January 13, 1673 at the Hotel de Bourgogne, Mithridates follows Bajazet and precedes Iphigenia in Racine's work. The subject is drawn from ancient history. Mithridates VI Eupator reigned over the kingdom of Pontus, around the Black Sea. Famous for having gradually accustomed to poisons through mithridatization, he long resisted the Romans. He finally killed himself after being betrayed by his own son. Racine shows several episodes of the life of Mithridates in one day and, as usual, gives great importance to the amorous intrigues. However, the epic is still more prevalent than in other tragedies. In terms of style, the piece is distinguished by a large number of long speeches and monologues. Mithridates was the favorite tragedy of another great king, Louis XIV. Over the centuries, the play has become increasingly rare on stage. Today, it is one of the least performed works of Racine. The play formed the basis for Mozart's opera Mitridate, re di Ponto (1770). Plot *Act 1 - Xiphares, a son of Mithridates, has just learned of the death of his father and the risk of a future Roman victory. He fears a betrayal of his brother Pharnaces, who has always supported the Romans. Xiphares sees Monime, fiance of Mithridates, to whom he declares his love. Pharnaces then inherits the kingdom of his father and his fiance. We then learn that while Mithridates is not dead, he is very close. Xiphares and Pharnaces then enter into a pact to stand by each other. *Act 2 - Monime cannot find the strength to accommodate Mithridates as it should. The king receives a second confirmation of the treachery of his son Pharnaces. He announces his intention to run. Furthermore, Monima is forced to marry Mithridates, but is suspected to love Pharnaces. Monime finally tells Xiphares she loves him, but she is determined to follow the wishes of Mithridates. *Act 3 - Mithridates will attempt to invade Italy to strike the enemy's heart. Xiphares approves the project and wants to participate. Mithridates orders Pharnaces to marry the daughter of a Parthian king. Pharnaces refuses. Mithridates has him arrested and fears a betrayal of Xiphares. Xiphares's love is revealed. To set a trap, Mithridates tells Monime he wants her to marry Xiphares and her reaction is that she loves Xiphares. *Act 4 - Xiphares, who knows he has been discovered, wants to escape, but Monime reveals that there is another who showed their love to Mithridates. The latter decides to marry Monime before leaving for Italy in exchange for his forgiveness, but does not know whether to punish Xiphares or Monime, or neither. Meanwhile, Pharnaces reveals the plan of attack from Italy to the Romans, who have landed. *Act 5 - The Romans attack the palace. A servant brings Mithridates and Monime poison so that they can commit suicide and there is a rumor that Xiphares has died. Mithridates, who is defeated, is pierced by a sword in pardoning Monime. Xiphares, meanwhile, managed to repel the attack of the Romans. Before dying, Mithridates, proud of the final victory of his son, unites Monime Xiphares and advised them to flee.

A British fleet under Henry Osborn, which had blockaded a French fleet in Cartagena, attacked and defeated a French force under Michel-Ange Duquesne de Menneville coming to their assistance. The interception of the French fleet ensured that only limited assistance would come to the French fortress of Louisbourg in North America, which was besieged by British forces and fell later that year.Middleton p.66-67  Background  In 1756 a French expedition sailed out of Toulon and captured Minorca. After this French ships withdrew to Toulon and did not attempt to depart for the next eighteen months. Operating from their base at Gibraltar British ships mounted an effective blockade at the mouth of the Mediterranean. In 1757 a British attempt to capture Louisbourg in North America had been frustrated by a build-up of French ships in the surrounding area. The French hoped to adopt a similar strategy for 1758, and decided to send the Brest fleet to boost their forces around Louisbourg. In November 1757 a French force of fifteen ships under Admiral La Clue sailed from Toulon, but following a storm on 30 November they were forced to take shelter in the port of Cartagena, in neutral Spain.Rodger p.274 They remained there as the British under Henry Osborn moved to bottle up the French in port.Dull p.86 Osborn had orders to prevent the French from escaping from the Mediterranean. He received word that a French reinforcement of three ships-of-the-line had set sail from Toulon under Michel-Ange Duquesne de Menneville, intending to combine with La Clue.Corbett p.255-57 Two other ships, after failing to capture a British convoy, had also managed to slip into Cartagena to reinforce La Clue.Dull p.115  Battle  Osborn was cruising off Cartagena when he sighted Duquesne's ships approaching.Rodger p.274 Spotting the larger British force, Duquesne ordered his ships to scatter. With the bulk of his force, Osborn made sure that La Clue was still trapped in Cartagena so he could not come out to help Duquesne. He detached ships to pursue the retreating French. The Orphee was caught and overpowered by three British ships while the Oriflamme was deliberately run aground to save it from capture. The third ship Foudroyant, Duquesne's flagship, tried to outrun the danger but was pursued by the Monmouth. After a chase that lasted into the night, the Monmouth caught up with the French ship and began to engage it. Monmouths captain, Arthur Gardiner, was killed in the fighting. Ultimately the Foudroyant surrendered and Duquesne was taken as a prisoner, ending the battle.Rodger p.274Dull p.115  Aftermath  By July Osborn decided it was too late in the year for the French to sail to North America, and he withdrew from around Cartagena to allow his ships to re-supply. Also coming to the conclusion that there was nothing he could do to assist Louisbourg, which fell on 26 July, La Clue and his ships sailed back to Toulon rather than attempt to force their passage through the Straits of Gibraltar.Johnston p.158 The battle went a long way to restoring the reputation of the Royal Navy which had been badly tarnished in the wake of the Fall of Minorca in 1756, which ultimately resulted in the execution of Admiral John Byng for \\"failing to do his utmost\\" to save Minorca. This was particularly the case as Arthur Gardiner had Byng's flagship at the Battle of Minorca and his death while fighting served to remove the allegation of cowardice against him.Rodger p.274 The campaign offered an example of the \\"tight blockade\\" tactics that the British would use even more vigorously the following year, made possible by an innovation in naval warfare because of developments in supplying ships at sea.

Aphanizomenon flos- aquae (AFA) is known to contain nutrients including essential fatty acids, active enzymes, vitamins, amino acids, minerals, proteins, complex carbohydrates, and phytochemicals and is marketed as a nutritional supplement.  Biology  Like other cyanobacteria and plants, AFA uses photosynthesis to produce the food material (glycogen) that is stored and utilized by the cell. While plants' cell walls are mainly cellulose, AFA's cell walls are composed of peptidoglycan (carbohydrates and peptides), the typical cell wall material of bacteria. Therefore, the designation \\"cyanobacteria\\" (Latin, cyano = blue- green) refers to the blue-green coloration of this bacterial subdivision, including AFA. The cellular structure of AFA is that of a simple prokaryote. Most cyanobacteria are highly efficient photosynthesizers, even more so than plants. Algae utilize light energy from the sun, carbon dioxide from the air, and water to synthesize proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. AFA is also able to directly use molecular nitrogen from the air to produce proteins and other nitrogen-containing biomolecules. This ability is widespread in prokaryotes, but unknown in eukaryotes. Potential toxicity Aphanizomenon flos-aquae as a species has both toxic and non-toxic forms. While benefits have been indicated, toxicity has been shown in some strains of the species Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, with cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxins present, and microcystins found contaminating AFA dietary supplements. The World Health Organization's Guidelines For Drinking Water Quality note Anatoxin-a, saxitoxins, and cylindrospermopsins are present in the Aphanizomenon genus. This linked article is about a single strain of AFA labeled as toxic that has been reclassified. Colony-forming morphology is one of the characteristics of the species Aphanizomenon flos-aquae; conversely Aphanizomenon are not known to form colonies. Algologists Li and Carmichael noted colony formation, or lack thereof, and other morphologic distinctions when comparing Aphanizomenon flos-aquae with Aphanizomenon. Their genetic comparison of Aphanizomenon flos- aquae to other species in the genus Aphanizomenon indicates dissimilarity between Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Aphanizomenon species.  History  Cyanobacteria have been a staple in the diets of many cultures and have been used for both food and commerce by indigenous peoples all over the globe, from Africa and Asia to the Americas, from the Chinese to the Aztecs and Mayans. Aphanizomenon flos-aquae began to be harvested as a human dietary supplement in the early 1980s. In 1998 a dry weight of approximately 2.2 million lbs (1 million kls.) of AFA was harvested for the subsequent production of supplements by a number of commercial harvesters. Commercial standards vary greatly in terms of documenting product composition to the consumer. Today, AFA is marketed as a nutrient-dense food, harvested primarily from Upper Klamath Lake in North America.  Harvesting and processing  Cyanobacteria as a crop are sensitive to heat, light, and rapid spoilage. Some native cultures in Africa and the Americas used simple sun-drying methods for preservation, but it is likely that a significant amount of the nutritional value was lost in the process because of exposure to extreme heat during harvesting and processing. The methods for harvesting and processing used to make cyanobacteria available for consumption today are critical factors in the quality and safety of the finished product. AFA is processed by screening to remove debris, testing for contaminating species, storing at the optimum temperature, and drying by a method that preserves nutrients. As with any crop, differences exist with regard to harvesting procedures, quality control against contaminating species, adherence to proper processing to protect nutrients from degradation, and attention to adequate storage conditions of the processed algae. Nutritional value Cyanobacteria are often marketed as a source of nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids (including omega 3 fatty acids), beta-carotene, chlorophyll, phycocyanin, active enzymes, amino acids, proteins, complex sugars, phytonutrients, and other bioactive components. The nutrient content of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae is subject to much variation due to diverse habitats, environmental factors, and harvesting procedures, all of which influence the nutritional value; for example, altitude, temperature, and sun exposure can greatly affect lipid and pigment composition. As more is learned about the components of different cyanobacterial species, growers and harvesters are better able to determine the optimal growth conditions for obtaining optimal yields.  Vitamins  Aphanizomenon flos-aquae has been shown to contain varying amounts at least 13 vitamins: vitamin A (beta-carotene), vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin E, vitamin K, and many of the B-complex vitamins including B1 (thiamin), B2 (riboflavin), B6 (pyridoxine), choline, biotin, niacin, folic acid, pantothenic acid, and B12 (cobalamin). However, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae contains pseudovitamin B12 which can block absorption of true B12 and is therefore not suitable for use as a B12 source for humans.  Minerals  Aphanizomenon flos-aquae contains minerals and trace minerals (including calcium, chloride, chromium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, sodium, and zinc). Whether or not AFA microalgae contain a balance of bioavailable minerals and trace minerals depends on the mineral content of their growth environment.  Protein  AFA is approximately 60% protein by dry weight.  Essential fatty acids  Approximately 45% of the lipids (fats) of AFA are essential fatty acids. Aphanizomenon flos-aquae contains a balance of both linoleic acid (LA, an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, an omega-3 fatty acid). Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital who studied AFA's fat content concluded that AFA \\"should be a valuable nutritional resource.\\" AFA raises the blood levels of the good fatty acids more than would be expected based on its ALA content alone. They speculated that some micronutrients may enhance fatty acid utilization. The levels of \\"good\\" fatty acids (ALA, EPA, DHA) went up while the levels of arachidonic acid went down.  Photosynthetic pigments  Chlorophyll is the green pigment found in plants that is responsible for the production of oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. Chlorophyll is a significant phytonutrient as well as a powerful antioxidant. AFA contains 1 to 2% chlorophyll (dry weight). AFA is also a source of phycocyanin (PC), a photosynthetic pigment with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that contributes the 'blue' to blue-green algae.  Phenylethylamine  AFA contains phenylethylamine (PEA).  Evidence of health effects  Many claims are based on research done on individual nutrients that Aphanizomenon flos- aquae contains, such as vitamins, minerals, chlorophyll, various antioxidants, and others. For example, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which are very important in maintaining membrane fluidity, comprise up to 10% of AFA's dry weight. Animal research at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School found that AFA microalgae raised blood levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). EPA and DHA are known to contribute to optimal functioning of numerous organ systems, including the nervous system. The researchers found that AFA was more effective than soybean oil, a good source of PUFAs, at raising blood levels of these omega-3 fatty acids. A team at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, Canada, demonstrated that consumption of AFA results in an immediate change in the trafficking of immune cells. The effect is transient and cell-type specific. An extensive body of data documents that long-term consumption does not lead to hyper-stimulation of the immune system. According to researchers, AFA blue-green algae make natural killer cells \\"patrol\\" better throughout the body. These effects were seen when using a low oral dose of algae (1.5 gram), corresponding to a low amount of food supplementation. In: The special molecule that provides the blue color in blue-green algae is called phycocyanin. Depending on the algae source, the amount of phycocyanin can amount to up to 15% of the dry weight of the algae. Phycocyanin has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. One study evaluated the ability of a novel natural extract of AFA enriched with phycocyanin to protect normal human erythrocytes and blood plasma samples against oxidative damage in vitro. In red blood cells, oxidative hemolysis and lipid peroxidation induced by the aqueous peroxyl radical generator [2, 2'-Azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride, AAPH] were significantly lowered by the AFA extract in a time- and dose-dependent manner; at the same time, the depletion of cytosolic glutathione was delayed. In plasma samples, the natural extract inhibited the extent of lipid oxidation induced by the pro-oxidant agent cupric chloride (CuCl2); a concomitant increase of plasma resistance to oxidation was observed as evaluated by conjugated diene formation. In recent years, there has been an increase of interest in microalgal metabolites. A water-based extract of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae containing high concentrations of phycocyanin inhibited the in vitro growth of one out of four tumor cell lines, indicating that at least some tumor cell types may be directly sensitive to killing by phycocyanin. Blue-green algae in general contain a significant amount of carotenoids, namely beta-carotene, lycopene, and lutein, providing microalgae with antioxidant properties. By their quenching action on reactive oxygen species, antioxidants carry intrinsic anti-inflammatory properties. Other research describes the identification of three new high molecular weight polysaccharide preparations isolated from food-grade microalgae that are effective activators of human monocytes/macrophages, including \\"Immunon\\" from Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. Immunostimulatory activity was measured using transcription factor-based bioassay. Each polysaccharide studied in this research, including AFA, substantially increased mRNA levels of interleukin and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a). These polysaccharides are between one hundred and one thousand times more active for in vitro monocyte activation than polysaccharide preparations that are currently used clinically for cancer immunotherapy. Research also characterizes the effect of a water- soluble preparation from known agents that modulate the immune system. One such study suggests that the macrophage-activating properties of an AFA water- soluble preparation are mediated through pathways that are similar to LPS- dependent activation. The antimutagenic properties of whole, fresh-water AFA were tested using the Ames test. Simultaneous addition of both algae and Nitrovin (a mutagen) to the test medium did not reduce the mutagenic activity. Addition of freeze-dried AFA to the test medium 2‚Äì24 hours before the application of the mutagen reduced mutagenic activity. An ethanol extract of AFA-cellular concentrate has been shown to increase stem cell proliferative action when incubated with human adult bone marrow cells or human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors in culture. The preliminary study suggests that the ethanol extract of AFA cellular concentrate may act to promote proliferation of human stem cell populations.  Organic certification  Organic certification can be a lengthy and complicated process, and it is achieved only through strict compliance with established official regulations. Requirements vary from country to country, and generally involve a stringent set of production standards for growing, storage, processing, packaging, and shipping. It is up to individual algae producers to apply for and secure organic certification by adherence to the certifying agency's standards.

Widely regarded as one of the pioneers of the freestyle era in the 1980s, he was one of the first European riders to compete on American soil. Since retiring at an early age of twenty one in 1991, he established himself as a disc jockey. Biography Born near Southend, Essex; Campbell first came to attention in 1983 when Bob Haro, needing a British rider to represent his company, noticed Campbell's performance at a competition taking place at Harrow Skate Park thus sponsoring him in the process, making him the first non-American rider to receive a full sponsorship by Haro, resulting in Campbell's sudden popularity. Throughout his career, he have won a number of titles, amongst those are the UK King Of the Skatepark in 1984 and the UKBFA British Pro Freestyle Champion in 1985. He also was one of the first European riders to compete in the United States and was the first to experiment with the Rocket Air on a BMX bike in 1986 after seeing Christian Hosoi performing it on a skateboard, although Ron Wilkerson was stated by some source to being the pioneer, though he popularised the move. He is also credited for revolutionising the 540 wallride, again on a BMX bike during a 2hip event in 1988. In 1985, his association with Pro-Lite led him to get his own signature frame, built by Freewheeler, it became the best selling freestyle bike of the year, outselling its following two rivals. In 1987, Campbell, now without a sponsor, was spending a year working in a sound mixing studio, producing soundtracks for TV commercials. Realising that his friend, Jess Dyrenforth, was in the United States getting paid to ride on shows, that prompted Campbell and his friends Nick Phillip and Lee Reynolds to move there to further their BMX career in the following year. In 1991, as his contract with GT came to an end, he returned to the United Kingdom. As he was finding difficulty in making a living from freestyle BMX as well as a growing interest in music meant he retired in 1991 at the age of twenty one, where he established a career as a disc jockey.

Notable for his long tenure as sports editor of the Los Angeles Times beginning in June 1981, he moved to the writing ranks full-time in June 2006.Los Angeles Times, March 3, 2006, page D3 (announcement of move from editor to columnist) But for virtually his whole career he has worked both sides of the desk, as an editor and writer, and today writes several weekly columns for the Times.Sports Business Journal, Sept. 17-23, 2001 (his vision of a sports editor) After a high-profile, multi-sport athletic career at Sheboygan North High School, Dwyre went to the University of Notre Dame, where he was a member of the tennis team and sports editor of ND Voice, the forerunner of the university‚Äôs current daily paper, The Observer. He graduated in 1966 with a degree in Communication Arts and began his journalism career shortly thereafter, as a sports copy editor for the Des Moines Register until 1968. From 1968 to 1981 he worked at the Milwaukee Journal, where he was made sports editor in 1975. He moved to the Los Angeles Times as assistant sports editor, and three months later was promoted to sports editor. Professional awards and recognition Dwyre rose to national prominence with the Los Angeles 1984 Summer Olympics, for which he mobilized a staff of more than 100, including 59 credentialed reporters, at that time the largest of its kind for Olympic coverage. The staff published 24 special daily editions, most of them 44 pages, of Olympic coverage in addition to the paper‚Äôs regular sports section. It was an unprecedented display of newspaper Olympic coverage for which Dwyre had seemingly boundless budgetary and personnel resources. The success of the ‚Äô84 Summer Games as reflected in the excellence of the L.A. Times‚Äô coverage garnered Dwyre several awards, including National Editor of the Year from the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.; the National Headliner Award from the Press Club of Atlantic City; and the Los Angeles Times Award for Sustained Excellence, all conferred in 1985. Recognition for Dwyre‚Äôs work on the 1984 Summer Olympic Games has been bookended by a host of local, regional and national honors. The most prestigious was the Red Smith Award from the Associated Press Sports Editors in 1996 for service to sports journalism. Other accolades include: the Wisconsin Sportswriter of the Year (1980); the Loyola Marymount Pride of Lions Award for Service to the Community (1993); the Powerade Sports Story of the Year from the National Assn. of Sportscasters and Sportswriters for his Los Angeles Times Magazine cover story on college basketball coach and social icon John Wooden (1999); the U.S. Tennis Writers Assn.

The detectives are led to a notorious hustler, \\"Bunny\\" (Bobby Jones), a familiar face from Green's past. When \\"Bunny\\" is found dead, Lupo is called to the scene and discovers his partner, Green, is the shooter, causing confusion in the department and disbelief in the DA's office. The case is turned over to Internal Affairs Detective Kevin Bernard and Sergeant Gregory Cole (Peter Bradbury), leaving Green in danger of losing his badge. Green is indicted, and his partner is forced to deliver testimony unfavorable to the defense. However, most of Green's colleagues are unwilling to give up on him, and they use their skills to dig deeper. By the end of the episode, all charges against Green are dropped. Lieutenant Van Buren assures him that he is welcome back on the force, but Green, unhappy with having \\"broken every rule in the book\\", decides to leave the squad. Lupo is given Green's position of a senior partner, and Bernard - who had earlier shared with Van Buren his desire to transfer to Homicide - becomes Lupo's new partner. Trivia * This was Jesse L.

Maisan (Horse Ear Mountain) is part of the Maisan Provincial Park complex and visitors to the park frequently visit Geumdangsa on the way to, or from, the better known Tapsa (Pagoda Temple) that lies to the northeast, up the path through the park. Further up the path, past Lake Tapyeongje and Tapsa, is found the small temple of Eunsusa in the park as well. Origin Geumdangsa was built in 814 during the reign of King Heondeok of the Silla Dynasty (57 BCE - 935 CE) and is known as the place where the Goryeo monk Naong Hwasang practiced his form of asceticism. According to another account, the daughter of General Jeon Bong-jun, who led the anti-establishment and anti-foreigner campaign Donghak Peasant Revolution in 1894, sought refuge here. The temple also served as a base for guerrilla troops in the Jinan area during the Japanese colonial period. Treasures Tangible Cultural Properties #18 Geumdangsamokbuljwasang (Seated Buddha statue in Geumdangsa Temple). This Amitabha Buddha is believed to have been first built during the Unified Silla period (668-935). The gentle facial expression and the plumpness of the body indicates that this image is likely from around 1675. The square face, the smaller shoulders, and the simple style of the robes are typical of Buddhist images of the late Joseon period (1392-1910). Cultural Properties Materials #122 Geumdangsaseoktap (Stone Pagoda of Geumdang Temple) Gwaneumbodhisavtta painted in 1686. Monks would conduct prayer rituals appealing for rain in the presence of the painting. Treasure #1266 Treasure #1266 Geumdangsa houses the hanging painting of the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva (Gwaneumbodhisavtta). This painting is a representative example of a hanging Buddhist painting, measuring 9 meters/30 feet high and 5 meters/16.4 feet wide. Gwaneumbodhisavtta was painted by 3 artists in the 12th year of King Sukjong in the Joseon Dynasty (1686). Gwaneumbodhisavtta is adorned with a coronet decorated with several Buddha faces over lotus blossoms, surrounded by phoenixes on the left and right sides. Gwaneumbodhisavtta's form is depicted as small with a very large face when compared to the proportions of the body. The magnificently decorated robes, with splendid ornaments, patterns and shape, overwhelms the canvas. Scarlet is main color with the use of the greens, pinks and white colors producing the warm and soothing aura of the painting. Surrounding Gwaeumbodhisavtta on the left and right are rows of magnificently colored flame-shaped patterns incorporating 20 small Buddhist gods. Gwaneumbodhisavtta is depicted with hands holding branches of a Yonghwasu tree. In the past whenever there was an extended drought in the area, the Geumdangsa monks would conduct prayer rituals appealing for rain in the presence of the painting, which invariably resulted in rainfall shortly thereafter.

It was purchased in a hostile takeover Most of its pulp and paper assets were sold to James River Corporation, and are now part of Georgia-Pacific. Its name lives on most notably through the Crown Zellerbach Building in San Francisco (One Bush Plaza) and various philanthropic projects of the Zellerbach family. The company invented folded paper towels, cardboard egg cartons, and the window envelope. History Anthony Zellerbach was born to a Jewish family in 1832 in Bavaria, Germany. He emigrated to America in 1846, first to Philadelphia, then to Moor's Flat, Nevada, in 1856. In 1882, together with his son Jacob Zellerbach, he founded the Zellerbach Paper Company. Another son, Isador Zellerbach, later joined the company, and it changed its name to A. Zellerbach and Sons, and another son Henry Zellerbach joined in 1896, but the firm changed its name back to the Zellerbach Paper company in 1907. The company invented folded paper towels commonly found in public washrooms whereby pulling one paper towel out from the bottom of a stack leaves the whole stack intact. The company also invented cardboard egg cartons and the window envelope, which was first used by the billing unit of San Francisco-based Pacific Gas and Electric Company. In 1928, the Zellerbach Paper Company merged with the Crown Willamette Paper Company to form publicly-traded Crown Zellerbach Corp. The company had assets of nearly $100 million, over 350,000 acres of timberland, and paper mills throughout the Pacific Coast capable of producing 1450 tons of finished paper daily.Crown Zellerbach Corp., Lehman Brothers Collection, Harvard Business School It expanded steadily throughout the 1930s and substantially during the second world war when European paper manufacturers no longer exported to the United States. In 1947 it started producing coated paper for Time Life Magazine. It eventually started expanding through acquisitions of the Canadian Western Lumber Company and St. Helens Pulp and Paper. In 1952, it was the second largest landholder in the American West after Weyerhaeuser. In 1958, it became the subject of a U.S. Justice department antitrust suit due to its market position and was forced to undo some of its acquisitions. In the 1960s and 1970s, the corporation diversified and expanded its reach internationally - a common tactic at the time. This exposed the company to markets experiencing significant competition, but also diversified its products to include timber and plastics. Because of the years it acquired its landholdings, the carrying value of its vast timberland on its balance sheet was significantly lower than the timberland's market value. Moreover, new environmental and other land use restrictions made it difficult for other companies to assemble such a portfolio of land, but the market was not fully aware of the new litigation environment. This led to a significantly undervalued stock price. In late 1984, Crown Zellerbach became the focus of a hostile takeover by British financier Sir James Goldsmith, who gained control of the company in July 1985 and became its chairman. The last chief executive of the company was William T. Creson who relinquished the chairmanship Creson had succeeded as CEO and chairman in It was widely speculated that Goldsmith wanted to buy the company for its undervalued land holdings. Goldsmith spun off three business areas into companies that he would control: the timberlands and wood products (Cavenham Forest Industries), the brown paper container business (Gaylord Container Ltd.) and computer supply company Eczel Corporation. In December 1985, Goldsmith agreed to sell the remainder of Crown Zellerbach with majority of the pulp and paper business to the James River Corporation. Gaylord Container was sold in October 1986 and became Gaylord Container Corporation; it was acquired in 2002 by Temple-Inland, later acquired by International Paper.

They were emancipated under the tribe's 1866 treaty with the United States following the American Civil War, during which the Creek Nation had allied with the Confederacy. Freedmen who wished to stay in the Creek Nation in Indian Territory, with whom they often had blood relatives, were to be granted full citizenship in the Creek Nation. Many of the African Americans had removed with the Creek from the American Southeast in the 1830s, and lived and worked the land since then in Indian Territory. The term also includes their modern descendants in the United States. At the time of the war and since, many Creek Freedmen were of partial Creek descent by blood.\\"Creek Freedmen\\" , Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture, Oklahoma Historical Society Registration of tribal members under the Dawes Commission often failed to record such ancestry. In 2001, the Creek Nation changed its membership rules, requiring all members to prove descent to persons listed as \\"Indian by Blood\\" on the Dawes Rolls. The Creek Freedmen have sued against this decision. History Most of the Freedmen were former slaves of tribal members who had lived in both upper and lower Creek territories in the Southeast. In some villages, Creek citizens married enslaved men or women, and had mixed-race children with them. Interracial marriage was then common, and many Creek Freedmen were partly of Creek Indian ancestry. Because most of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation allied with the Confederacy, after the Civil War's Union victory, the United States in 1866 required a new treaty with the Creek Nation and others of the Five Civilized Tribes, which also had allied with the Confederacy. The treaty required the tribes to emancipate their slaves and to offer them citizenship in the Creek and other nations, eligible for voting rights and shares of annuities and land settlements. The treaty called for the setting aside of the western half of the territory (thereafter called Unassigned Lands) for the United States to use for the settlement of freedmen and other American Indian tribes from the Great Plains. The Creek were forced to cede , for which the United States agreed to pay the sum of thirty cents per acre, amounting to $975,165.\\"Treaty with Creeks, June 14, 1866\\", accessed 3 May 2010 Article 4 of the treaty said that the US would conduct a census of the Creek tribe, to include the Freedmen. In 1893, the United States Dawes Commission under the direction of Henry L. Dawes was established by an act of Congress. The Dawes Act was part of a continuing effort to assimilate American Indians and directed the break- up of communal tribal lands and the allotment of 160-acre plots to individual households. All members of each tribe had to be registered for land allotment. Beginning in 1898, the US officials created the Dawes Rolls to document the tribal members for such allotments; registrars quickly classified persons as \\"Indians by Blood,\\" \\"Freedmen,\\" or \\"Intermarried Whites.\\" However, it included the Creek Freedmen citizens in the Creek nation. The enrollment under the Dawes Commission lasted until April 26, 1906. The final Dawes rolls constitute a record of documented ancestors of Creek Freedmen, but tribal members and historians have complained that the rolls were inaccurate. The Dawes Rolls have been used as a kind of historic records that form a recognized base for determining tribal membership. Many of the tribes in Oklahoma have increasingly relied on them as sources from which they can require persons applying for membership to document direct descent from historical members of the tribe. Critics charge that many mistakes were made in how individuals were recorded. For instance, although many Freedmen were of Creek descent, they were included only on Freedmen rolls rather than being noted as being \\"Indian by Blood.\\" Since the late 20th century, such designation as Freedmen has worked against many of their descendants as the Creek and other nations have tightened their rules for membership. Most of the Creek Freedmen were farmers in the 19th and the early 20th centuries. Some also owned bees and produced honey, such as Tartar Grayson, known as the \\"Great Bee Man.\\" The children of Creek Freedmen attended racially-segregated schools, which were established in European-American areas as well, but they lived in Creek territory as citizens of the Creek nation. Changes in membership rules The peace treaty of 1866 granted the Freedmen full citizenship and rights as Creek regardless of proportion of Creek or Indian ancestry. The Muscogee (Creek) Nation in 1979 reorganized the government and constitution based on the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act of 1936. It changed its membership rules, requiring that members be descendants of persons listed as 'Indians by Blood' on the Dawes Rolls. They expelled Creek Freedmen descendants who could not prove descent from such persons, despite the 1866 treaty, asserting their sovereign right to determine citizenship.FIVE CIVILIZED TRIBES--STATUS OF FREEDMEN--ORGANIZATION UNDER OKLAHOMA WELFARE ACT -- October 1, 1941, Oklahoma University Since the Creek changed their membership rules in 2001, they have excluded persons who cannot prove descent from persons listed on the Dawes Rolls as Indians by Blood.

On March 18, 1632, he was appointed Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. In 1635, he signed a treaty of alliance with Holland and Sweden. He acts as messenger between Gaston d'Orleans and the government. He is also a friend of Mazarin, but their friendship does not survive the period of the regency. After the death of Louis XIII, he relinquished his office June 23, 1643 but he was sent as plenipotentiary in the negotiations of Munster. Returning to France, he intrigued against Mazarin and approaches the Prince of Conde. He was arrested twice during the Fronde. In October 1652, just before his death he made a large donation to Anthony Singlin, Jansen, Director of Port Royal, who is even suspected of extortion on this occasion. His son, Armand Jean le Bouthillier de Ranc√©, was the founder of the Trappist order. Another son, Fran√ßois-Denis, was bishop of Troyes and Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Sens.

They played in the Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL) from 2010 to 2013. They played their home games at the James Brown Arena. History The Augusta RiverHawks were established as a new franchise in the Southern Professional Hockey League in 2010 by Bob and Diane Kerzner, who had formerly owned a different franchise, the Pee Dee/Twin City Cyclones. The RiverHawks replaced the Augusta Lynx, who had played in the city for ten years in the ECHL before folding in 2008. The name \\"RiverHawks\\" was announced for the new club on March 13, 2010 as the winning result of a fan vote. The RiverHawks opened their inaugural season on the road on October 21, 2010, losing to the Fayetteville FireAntz. They had their home opener the following evening, against 2009‚Äì10 SPHL champions the Huntsville Havoc, ultimately losing 5‚Äì3, however they went on to place second in league by the season's close. In late February 2013, the ice refrigeration system at the James Brown Arena malfunctioned, causing the ice surface to melt. This forced the RiverHawks to play their remaining home games at their practice facility, where attendance was limited to season ticket holders and sponsors. Team owner Bob Kerzner, the city of Augusta, and arena operator Global Spectrum could not reach an agreement on repairing or replacing the arena's ice system in time for the club to commit to the 2013‚Äì14 SPHL season, forcing Kerzner to temporarily suspend team operations. Kerzner stated that he would retain his franchise rights during the RiverHawks' hiatus, hoping to return to play in the 2014‚Äì15 season. After considering relocating to either Greensboro, North Carolina, or Tallahassee, Florida, Kerzner, the SPHL, and the Macon-Bibb County Board of Commissioners announced on June 25, 2014, that the RiverHawks would relocate to Macon, Georgia, and resume play as the Macon Mayhem. The Mayhem signed a five-year lease with the city of Macon and played their home games in the Macon Coliseum starting in the 2015‚Äì16 season. The SPHL previously had a franchise in Macon called the Macon Trax during its inaugural 2004‚Äì05 season.

He is a three-time Grey Cup champion as a player, having won with the Tigers in 1928, 1929, and 1932. He later coached the Hamilton Flying Wildcats, leading them to the 1943 Grey Cup championship. He was an inaugural member of the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1963 and was also inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1975. Brian Timmis Stadium in Hamilton, Ontario was named after him. Early life Timmis was born in Winnipeg and moved to Ottawa in 1910 where his father, a militia member, was stationed.Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, Brian Timmis He played football locally before enlisting in the Canadian Armed Forces in 1915 by stating he was two years older than he actually was. After returning from the First World War in 1919, he played junior football for the Ottawa Seconds. After being released from military service, Timmis joined the Royal Canadian Mounted Police where he was stationed in Regina. Senior football career Following his move to Regina, Timmis played locally for the Regina Rugby Club where he played from 1920 to 1922. In a game in 1921, an opponent nearly strangled him with his own chinstrap, so Timmis played the rest of his career without a helmet. In 1923, he moved back to Ottawa and played one season for the Ottawa Rough Riders. He joined the Hamilton Tigers in 1924 and played in his first game with the club on October 4, 1924, starting at middle wing. The team finished in first place in the IRFU in 1924, but lost the East Final to the Queen's Golden Gaels. After sub-par seasons in 1925 and 1926, where the team did not qualify for playoffs, Timmis played in his first Grey Cup game in 1927, but the Tigers lost to the Toronto Balmy Beach Beachers. The Tigers then won back-to-back Grey Cup championships over Timmis' former club, Regina, in 1928 and 1929 while Timmis scored two touchdowns in the 1928 game. Timmis was named an Eastern All-Star by the Canadian Press in 1932 at the Tackle position, which was the first year players were named all-stars.

He played with infected tonsils and shoulder neuritis, leaving his left arm limp, but still played the entire game. He was cheered on by the crowd in Ottawa as he left the field as a player for the final time.

The prohibitions are derived from the Torah in and , and the Mishnah in tractate Kilayim, which has a Gemara in the Jerusalem Talmud, further elaborates on the applicable circumstances. Prohibitions The Torah (; ) lists several different examples of mixtures that are prohibited as mixed species. The halakha classifies the prohibitions under the following categories:Wald, Stephen (2007) * interbreeding of animals of different species * planting mixed seeds * grafting of different species of trees * shatnez - mixing wool and linen in garments * planting grain or seed-crop in a vineyard * ploughing or doing other work with two different species of animal. Permitted and forbidden instances In fabrics Torah law forbids the wearing of Kil'ayim (shatnez) - sheep wool and linen fabrics that have been hackled together, or spun and woven together. Likewise, \\"intertying\\" sheep wool and linen together is forbidden, the two exceptions being garments of kohanim worn in the Temple and tzitzit. Concerning tzitzit, the Sages of Israel permit using wool and linen strings in tandem only when genuine blue dye tchelet is available, whereas kabbalist sources go a step further by encouraging this practice. The Torah forbids only wool and linen to be worn together.Kiara, S. (1987), Hil. Kil'ayim, p. 390 Camel's wool, Cashmere wool, Yak fiber, and the like of such fibres, are not prohibited to be worn with linen.Nathan ben Abraham (1955), vol. 1, s.v. Tractate Kil'ayim, chapter 8 According to Maimonides, if a Jew had purchased an all-woolen product from a gentile and wanted to ascertain whether or not it was, indeed, pure wool ‚Äì without the admixture of flax- linen, its fabric could be tested by dyeing. A dye-solution applied to the fabric would reveal whether or not it was of pure wool, as wool and linen products do not retain the same shades in a dye solution.Maimonides (1974), vol. 4, s.v. Hil. Kil'ayim 10:27‚Äì28 In plantings The prohibition of sowing together diverse seedlings is derived from the biblical verse, \\"You shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed\\" (), and which prohibition has been explained to mean planting or sowing two or more diverse vegetable crops within a radius of three-handbreadths, ca. , from one another, where they draw nutrients from each other. As a first resort, however, one is to distance two or more diverse vegetable crops from each other at a remove of six- handbreadths, ca. , even if their foliage were to grow and intermix.Maimonides (1974), vol. 4, Hil. Kil'ayim 3:10Cf. Mishnah (Kil'ayim 2:10); Two or more diverse seed-crops must be distanced enough so as to be distinguished from each other as two separate plantings.Maimonides (1974), vol. 4, Hil. Kil'ayim 3:7 The laws governing diverse seed-plantings or vegetables apply only to crops grown in the Land of Israel, but do not apply to seed-crops or vegetables planted outside the Land of Israel.Aharon HaLevi (1958), mitzvah # 245Meiri (2006), p. 94, Kiddushin 39a, s.v. ◊õ◊ú◊ê◊ô ◊ñ◊®◊¢◊ô◊ù According to biblical exegete Nachmanides, the reason for its prohibition being that when seedlings draw nutrients from other seedlings, their properties and natural forms are changed thereby and the sower cancels thereby the fixed design and purpose of the universe.Rabbi Moses ben Nahman on the Torah, s.v. Leviticus 19:19 Diverse seed-plantings or vegetables that grew together in violation of the biblical command are permitted to be eaten,, Hil. Kil'ayim (p. 390) although the crop itself must be uprooted.Sifra on Leviticus 19:19Cf. If two diverse grain seeds (e.g. wheat and barley) were inadvertently mixed together, they must be separated before they can be sown. If, however, there were 24 parts more of one grain than the other (ratio of 24 to 1), the lesser grain is considered cancelled by the other, and may still be sown together. If there were not 24 parts more than the mixed grain, the whole must be sorted.Cf.

It also permits the planting of White mustard (Sinapis alba) () and of Egyptian mustard (Brassica nigra) () together (Kil'ayim 1:2), despite being two different genera.Amar, Z.

(2015), p. 109, explaining Maimonides' commentary on Mishnah Kil'ayim 1:5. Field showing distinct plots for different species Cucumbers () and muskmelons (),On the definition of this last word, melephephon, see Mishnah Commentary by Pinchas Kehati (1977), ninth edition, vol. 1 (Zera'im), s.v. Kil'ayim 1:2, who explains this fruit as \\"melon.\\" The 11th-century Mishnah exegete, Nathan ben Abraham I, also explained melephephon as having the Judeo-Arabic connotation of ◊ê◊ú◊õ'◊®◊ë◊ñ (muskmelon), saying that it was ‚Äúone of the kinds of watermelon whose smell is sweet.‚Äù The Jerusalem Talmud (Kil'ayim 1:2) relates an ancient belief that if one were to take a seed from a watermelon and a seed from an apple, and then place them together in an impression made in the earth, the two seeds would fuse together and become diverse kinds. \\"It is for this reason,\\" says the narrator of the Talmud, \\"that they call it (i.e. the fruit) by its Greek name, melephephon. The old Greek word for \\"melon\\" was actually ŒºŒÆŒªŒø = m√™lo(n) apple + œÄŒµœÄœåŒΩ = p√©p≈çn an edible (lit. ripened) [gourd], meaning literally \\"apple-shaped melon\\" (see: Random House Webster's College Dictionary, s.v. melon). This fruit, muskmelon (Cucumis melo), was thought to be a cross-breed between a watermelon and an apple. Maimonides, however, calls \\"melephephon\\" in Mishnah Kil'ayim 1:2 and Terumah 8:6 by the Arabic name, al- khiyyƒÅr, meaning \\"cucumbers\\" (Cucumis sativus) ‚Äì which although far from an apple is in the same genus and watermelons. Talmudic exegete, Rabbi Solomon Sirilio (1485‚Äì1554), disputed Maimonides' view in his commentary on the Jerusalem Talmud (Kil'ayim 1:2, s.v. ◊ß◊ô◊©◊ï◊™), saying that Maimonides explained \\"melephephon\\" to mean in Spanish \\"pepinos\\" = cucumbers (Cucumis sativus), which, in the opinion of an early Mishnaic exegete, Rabbi Isaac of Siponto (c. 1090‚Äì1160), was really to be identified as ‚Äúsmall, round melons‚Äù (Cucumis melo), since Rabbi Yehudah in our Mishnah holds that it is a diverse kind in relation to kish≈´t (snakemelon , H. Paris 2012 p. 2, phenotypically similar to cucumber). Nevertheless, today, in Modern Hebrew, the word melephephon is now used to denote \\"cucumbers,\\" based on Maimonides' identification. although two different species, are not considered \\"diverse kinds\\" with respect to each other and may be planted together.Mishnah Kil'ayim 1:2 Rabbi Yehudah, disputing, says that they are considered \\"diverse kinds\\" with respect to each other and cannot be planted together. Although two different species, the Mishnah (Kil'ayim 1:3) permits planting together turnips (Brassica rapa subsp. rapa) () with rape (Brassica napus) ().Although the vegetable known as nefos was called by Maimonides by its idiom, \\"Syrian radish,\\" it was actually not a radish at all, since it is listed in Mishnah Kil'ayim 1:5 as being a diverse- kind (kil'ayim) in relation to the true radish (Heb. ◊¶◊†◊ï◊ü). Zohar Amar suggests that it may have actually been Brassica napus; see Amar, Z. (2015), p. 113. One is to bear in mind that Brassica napus has roots resembling those of parsnips and carrots, for which reason medieval Hebraists and philologists would have classified the vegetable as a parsnip / carrot (Judeo-Arabic: ◊ê◊ú◊í'◊ñ◊®), as did Rabbi Nathan ben Abraham in his commentary of the Mishnah. It is to be noted, furthermore, that in foliage, Brassica napus and turnip (Brassica rapa) have similar leaves, for which reason they are not considered diverse-kinds with respect to each other. Likewise, cauliflower (Brassica oleracea botrytis) () and kohlrabi (Brassica var. caulorapa) (), although different species, are permitted to be planted together.The Hebrew word kar≈´b being explained by Mishnaic exegete, Rabbi Nathan ben Abraham, as having the connotation of the Judeo-Arabic word ◊ê◊ú◊õ◊ú◊ù, meaning, \\"kohlrabi.\\" By this definition, the word kar≈´b is not to be confused with the Modern Hebrew word by the same name, now used for \\"cabbage\\" (cultivars of Brassica oleracea). See: Amar, Z.; Kapah, E. (2011), vol. 2, p. 19. Maimonides, in his commentary on the same Mishnah, explained the word kar≈´b as having the Judeo-Arabic connotation of ◊õ◊®◊†◊ë, meaning either cabbage (Brassica oleracea) or kale (Brassica oleracea var. acephala).Amar, Z. (2015), pp. 100, 172, explaining Maimonides' commentary on Mishnah Kil'ayim 1:3. Grafting of trees Grafting of two varieties of citrus trees The prohibition of grafting of trees is treated on in the Mishnah (Kil'ayim 1:4).Maimonides (1974), vol. 4, Hil. Kil'ayim 1:6, who wrote: \\"Among trees, there is no such thing as kil'ayim except with respect to grafting.\\" Cf. Kessar, ·∏§ayim (1988), vol. 2, p. 344, s.v. on Mishneh Torah, Hil. Kil'ayim 3:4. Rabbi ·∏§ayim Kessar writes there: \\"Such is the case with trees, where there are two trees similar in appearance to each other, etc. Mishnah ibid., and it is plain that it refers to a tree with respect to grafting, as I shall explain in what follows\\" (END QUOTE). The matter of tree grafting is evinced also by the Jerusalem Talmud (Kil'ayim 1:4), in a discussion on the same Mishnah, where after citing cases of grafting of two different kinds of trees named in the Mishnah, the trees were then cut down. The Talmud also brings down examples of hybrid fruit caused by grafting two dissimilar trees together. Among trees, while it is permissible to grow two different kinds of trees in close proximity to each other, it is forbidden for an Israelite (or a gentile working on behalf of an Israelite) to graft the branch (scion) of one tree onto the stump of another tree to produce thereby a hybrid fruit if the trees are not one and the same kind. Quinces (Cydonia oblonga) () are named as an exception, for if a branch taken from it were grafted onto a stump belonging to hawthorns (Crataegus azarolus) (), although they are two different species, it is permitted unto Israel to benefit therefrom, since they are considered related.Mishnah (Kil'ayim 1:4).On the definitions of these words, see: Amar, Z. (2015), pp. 132-133, 118 Likewise, to graft the branch of Krustemelin (said to be the \\"Calaprice pears\\")Thus explained by Isaac ben Melchizedek's Mishnah Commentary (1975:79), s.v. Kila'yim 1:4. On this fruit, see Pere calaprice. onto the rootstock of an ordinary pear (Pyrus communis) is permitted. However, apple trees (Malus domestica) () grafted onto medlars (Mespilus germanica) (),Definition here follows that of Maimonides. However, Rabbi Nathan ben Abraham explains ◊ó÷ª◊ñ◊®÷∑◊ì as being a cultivar of pear. or peach trees (Prunus persica) () grafted onto almond trees (Prunus dulcis) (), or jujubes (Ziziphus jujuba) () grafted onto Christ's thorn jujubes (Ziziphus spina-christi) (), although similar in appearance, are \\"diverse kinds.\\"Mishnah (Kil'ayim 1:4)On the definitions of these words, see: Amar, Z. (2015), pp. 76, 150, 157. In Modern Hebrew, the word shezƒ´f (Heb. ◊©◊ñ◊ô◊£) now means \\"plum\\" (Prunus domestica subsp. insititia, or simply known by the synonym Prunus insititia), although in today's meaning, it is not to be confused with the Mishnaic meaning. The fruit produced by grafting the bud of one dissimilar tree onto the rootstock of the other are permitted to be consumed by Israel,Babylonian Talmud (Hullin 115a)Meiri (2006), p. 94, Kiddushin 39a, s.v. ◊î◊®◊õ◊ë◊™ ◊ê◊ô◊ú◊üKiara, S. (1987), Hil. Kil'ayim, p. 394 although the trees themselves, according to some authorities, are not permitted to be maintained.Tosefta (Kil'ayim 1:3); Jerusalem Talmud (Kil'ayim 1:4). Cf. Jacob ben Asher, Arba'ah Turim (Yoreh De'ah 295:7); Halberstam, C. (2002), vol. 1, Yoreh De'ah, responsum # 60 (pp. 239‚Äì243)Cf. Chazon-Ish (1994), p. 46a‚Äìb [2:9], who brings down a rabbinic dispute over whether trees grafted by way of transgressing the prohibitive command require uprooting, or whether they can be maintained. The Chazon-Ish, who was uncertain about the identity of the trees mentioned in the Mishnah owing to conflicting opinions, made it a rule to be stringent in all of them, prohibiting their grafting in all cases. A Jew who transgressed by grafting two dissimilar trees was, formerly, liable to flogging.Babylonian Talmud (Kiddushin 39a) The prohibition of grafting two dissimilar trees applies to trees in the Land of Israel, as well as to trees outside the land of Israel; whether trees belonging to a Jew or to a gentile.Kanievsky, C. (1984), p. 5a [1:5 (26)] Vineyards The Sages of Israel have described the prohibition of growing diverse kinds in a vineyard, strictly from a biblical perspective, as referring only to two grain varieties (such as wheat and barley), or either to hemp and arum, or similar plants which reach maturity with the grain.Aharon HaLevi (1958), mitzvah # 548Meiri (2006), p. 94, Kiddushin 39a, s.v. ◊ï◊õ◊ú◊ê◊ô ◊î◊õ◊®◊ùIshtori Haparchi (1999), chapter 56, p. 265 By a rabbinic prohibition, however, it is not permitted to plant or maintain a vineyard while the vineyard shares the same immediate ground with any vegetable or seed-crop grown for food (e.g. mustard seeds, chickpeas, etc.). The result of doing so would be to cause its owner to forfeit the seed-crop together with the increase of the vineyard thereof.As explained by the words of the Torah (Deuteronomy 22:9): \\"Lest all should be forfeited together with the increase of the vineyard.\\" Therefore, the rabbis made it incumbent upon husbandmen and vine-dressers to distance their seed- crop from a vineyard. According to Maimonides, if a trellised vine of at least five plantings was made alongside a fence or a wall, even if the stumps of the grape-vines were distant from the wall one cubit, the planter of seed is only permitted to sow seed 4 cubits beyond the wall or fence, since the grape-vine is prone to spread itself as far as the wall, and there must always be at least 4 cubits from a vineyard and the seed-crop.Mishnah (Kil'ayim 6:1). Cf. Maimonides (1974), vol. 4, s.v. Hil. Kil'ayim 8:3. Certain plants that grow of themselves in a vineyard, such as lianas (Cissus spp.),Amar, Z.; Kapah, E. (2011), vol. 2, p. 14 (s.v. ◊ê◊ô◊®◊ï◊°) bindweed (Convolvulus spp.),The Hebrew word described here is ◊ß◊°◊ï◊°, and which, according to Zohar Amar, may also refer to the common ivy (Hedera helix) and the lablab bean (Dolichos lablab). See: Amar, Z. (2015), pp. 143‚Äì144. Mishnaic exegete, Rabbi Nathan ben Abraham, explains ◊ß◊°◊ï◊° as having the Judeo-Arabic connotation of ◊ê◊ú◊ú◊ë◊ú◊ê◊® (= Bindweed). Sweet clover (Melilotus), and the anemone (Anemone coronaria), do not account as \\"diverse kinds\\" to cause its owner to forfeit the crop of the vineyard altogether.Mishnah (Kil'ayim 5:8). Cf. the definition of these words in Rabbi Nathan ben Abraham's commentary of the Mishnah; Had a person transgressed and grew a seed-crop within his vineyard, not only is the produce forbidden to be eaten, but also had he sold the produce, the proceeds accruing from the sale of such produce are also forbidden.Nathan ben Abraham (1955), vol. 1, s.v. Tractate Kil'ayim Vineyard growing in Israel If thorn bushes, such as camelthorn (Alhagi maurorum) (Hebrew: ◊î◊î◊í◊ô◊ü), and box-thorn (Lycium shawii) (Hebrew: ◊ê◊ò◊ì◊ô◊ü), grew within a vineyard, they are not accounted as a seed-crop and may be sustained in a vineyard, the rabbis giving to them the classification of trees amongst trees.Tosefta (Kil'ayim 3:15) However, in places where thorn bushes are used as fodder for camels and the owner of the vineyard is content to have the thorn bushes grow in his vineyard to that end, the thorns bushes, if maintained, would render the entire vineyard forbidden.Ishtori Haparchi (1999), chapter 58, pp. 285-286 By a rabbinic injunction, the prohibition of growing diverse seed-crops in a vineyard extends to vineyards vintaged by Jews outside the Land of Israel.Meiri (2006), p. 94, Kiddushin 39a, s.v. ◊õ◊ú◊ê◊ô ◊î◊õ◊®◊ù The planter transgresses the biblical command from the moment grain begins to take root within a vineyard, and the grapes have reached the size of white peas (Vigna unguiculata).Sifrei on Deuteronomy 22:9 (P. Ki Tetzei)Maimonides (1974), vol. 4, s.v. Hil. Kil'ayim 5:13-15Ishtori Haparchi (1999), chapter 58, p. 299 In animals In modern classification of animals, the genus Canis is used to include dogs, wolves, coyotes, and jackals. Even so, the mating of dogs and wolves is forbidden. Similarly, the mating of a horse and mule (even though they cannot reproduce) is forbidden.Mishnah, Kil'ayim 1:6 Though a Jew is forbidden to crossbreed a horse and a donkey (producing a hinny or mule), had a gentile bred them, it is permitted for a Jew to make use of them.

She is known in the bodybuilding world for her artistic style of posing which involves modern and belly dancing, classic lines and symmetry which are often compared with those from the female bodybuilders from the late 1970s and early 1980s such as Cory Everson and Anja Langer. Although Shportun- Willemer has had the opportunity to compete at the pro level she has opted to remain competitive as an amateur level and recently won the 2009 Arnold Amateur International Bodybuilding Championship.  Biography  Shportun- Willemer was born in a city near Krasnoyarsk, Russia. At an early age she began to play a different types of sports. When she was seven, she started doing Artistic Gymnastics, and stopped after two years. Afterwards, her mother became her mentor and coached Shportun-Willemer in swimming and cross-country skiing. Later on at the age of 17 she continued her athletic lifestyle by doing karate. In 1995, at the age of nineteen, Shportun-Willemer began weight training when she visited a bodybuilding studio for the first time. Four years later she competed at an amateur bodybuilding competition for the first time; after her first experience competing in bodybuilding she decided that she needed to improve her performance on stage and began to take choreography and lessons in modern and belly dancing. This would later help her improve her posing routines on stage. During the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade), Elena has had a very successful amateur career in her native Russia as well as Europe. She has won the All-Russian Championships (2002‚Äì03) and World Amateur Championships twice (2005 and 2007), and the European Championships (2005). Recently 2009, proved to be a very good year for Shportun-Willemer, having won the 2009 Arnold Amateur Classic Championships, Oslo Grand Prix, and the Loaded Cup. Despite having had the opportunity to turn pro after winning the 2007 World Amateur Championships, Shpoturn has opted to stay away from the pro events citing the fact that the professional female bodybuilders carry more muscle than what she wants to have and also does not want to discourage women from weight training. Outside of the competitive stage Elena has a college degree from the Siberia-Aero Academy and worked as economist and lived for some time in Zheleznogorsk, Siberia until she moved to Germany after marrying her husband Claus Willemer, a freelance photographer. During her free time she enjoys writing poems, painting, and works as a make-up artist and costume designer.

She trains with traditional philosophy focusing on the major muscle groups of her body and avoiding heavy weight training for her traps and forearms. She rarely does heavy Regular Squats with a free barbells due to avoid developing a thicker waist and focuses on Hack Squats, Leg Presses, and Lunges for her legs. Elena believes that proper form is very important and often avoids extreme heavy weights. During the off-season she avoided any form of aerobic exercise to preserve her energy levels.

They are distinct from the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen, which denominates the Lands of the Hungarian Crown as a constituent part of the territory of Austria-Hungary during the totality of the subordination of Hungary to Austria-Hungary, from 30 March 1867 to 16 November 1918. Therefore the Lands of the Hungarian Crown constituted part of the later Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen (from 1867 to 1918). Middle Ages Holy Crown of Hungary St. King Ladislaus I used the title of \\"King of Slavonia\\" in 1091 (?). In 1102, during the reign of King Coloman of Hungary, the Kingdom of Croatia entered a dynastic union with the Kingdom of Hungary, and thereby Croatia became an autonomous kingdom within Hungary and subject to the Hungarian Crown. Therefore successive Hungarian kings bore the additional title of \\"King of Croatia and Dalmatia\\". In 1136, King B√©la II invaded the Bosnia for the first time and initiated the long enduring subjection of Bosnia to the Hungarian Crown.Marko Attila Hoare, The History of Bosnia: From the Middle Ages to the Present Day, Saqi, 2007, p. 35, Although it was a part of the Hungarian Crown Lands, the Banate of Bosnia was a de facto independent state for much of its history. In 1137, King B√©la II assumed the title of \\"King of Rama\\" (\\"Rex Ramae\\") to signify his rule of Bosnia, \\"Rama\\" being the name of a river in Bosnia, and his successors were also so styled. King B√©la II also instituted the inferior title of \\"Duke of Bosnia\\" as an honorary title for his adult son, later King Ladislaus II. After Stefan Nemanja and his son Vukan Nemanjiƒá swore fealty to King Emeric, he assumed the title of King of Serbia (\\"Rex Serviae\\") in 1202.Gyula Szekf≈±, A magyars√°g √©s a szl√°vok, Lucidus, 2000, p. 193, The Principality of Halych was annexed to the Lands of the Hungarian Crown during the reign of King Andrew II, who adopted the title of \\"King of Galicia\\".Vasyl π Mudryƒ≠, Lviv: A Symposium on Its 700th Anniversary, 1962, p. 62 Successive kings usually bore the alternative title of \\"King of Lodomeria and Galicia\\", \\"Lodomeria\\" denominating the city of Volodymyr-Volynskyi (contemporarily in Ukraine). B√©la IV of Hungary began expansionist politics towards Cumania. He promoted Christian missions among the pagan Cumans who dwelled in the plains south of the Carpathians. In 1228, he established the Diocese of Cumania which was initially under the jurisdiction of the Archbishopric of Esztergom. Local chieftains acknowledged his suzerainty and he adopted the title of King of Cumania (\\"Rex Cumaniae\\") in 1233. King Stephen V conquered territory in Bulgaria, received its local nobles as his vassals, and thereafter bore the title of \\"King of Bulgaria\\". The birth of the three regna Le Sieur Janvier's map of Hungary (1771) Between 1526 and 1541 Hungary disintegrated into three parts. From the 16th century, Hungary proper, Croatia and Transylvania were the three regna of the Crown. These lands had some links with each other but became more and more autonomous during the centuries. In the 18th century, the Lands of the Hungarian Crown consisted of the Kingdom of Hungary, the Kingdom of Croatia and the Kingdom of Slavonia with the city of Fiume, the Grand Principality of Transylvania, the Croatian Military Frontier, the Slavonian Military Frontier, and the Serbian-Hungarian military frontiers. Galicia was acquired by the Habsburgs in the name of the Hungarian Crown, however it was not attached to Hungary. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 the Hungarian government proclaimed in the April Laws of 1848 that Transylvania became fully integrated into Hungary, however, after the fall of the revolution, the March Constitution of Austria defined that the Principality of Transylvania as being a separate crown land that is entirely independent of Hungary.Austrian Constitution of 4 March 1849. (Section I, Art. I and Section IX., Art. LXXIV) In 1867, the Crown's two regna Transylvania and Hungary were reunited in the process of the creation of Austria-Hungary, however Kingdom of Croatia- Slavonia kept and improved its position as an autonomous realm within the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen. In 1881 Croatian and Slavonian military frontiers were abolished and united with Croatia-Slavonia. After World War One, Transylvania was ceded to Romania and Croatia (with Slavonia) formed the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (on 1 December 1918 it united with the Kingdom of Serbia to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes). The city of Fiume became short lived Free State of Fiume until 1924 when it was ceded to Italy. Territories of south-Hungarian counties in Banat, B√°cska and Baranya (the west of Temes County, Toront√°l County, B√°cs-Bodrog County and Baranya County) as a Province of Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

Their ancestors migrated from North America to South America during the Great American Interchange, following the formation of the Isthmus of Panama during the late Pliocene. The oldest dated confirmed remains are those of A. angustidens from Buenos Aires, Argentina, dating to the Ensenadan epoch, 1.76 to 0.98 Ma old, within the Early to Middle Pleistocene, with a tooth possibly belonging to Arctotherium dating about 2.588 Mya. They are genetically closer to the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), than to Arctodus of North America, implying the two extinct forms evolved large size in a convergent manner, perhaps to facilitate dominating other carnivores in the competition for the biggest carcasses. The northernmost species, A. wingei, known from Venezuela in South America, apparently invaded Central America and reached as far north as the Yucat√°n. Description Arctotherium was named by Hermann Burmeister in 1879. A specimen of A. angustidens from Buenos Aires shows an individual estimated, using the humerus, to weigh between , though the authors consider the upper limit as improbable and say that is more likely. An estimated standing height for Arctotherium is . It would still make the genus the largest bear ever found and contender for the largest carnivorous land mammal known. Its large size has been attributed to increased competition from other, later-arriving or evolving carnivorans, such as jaguars, or Smilodon, following the early dispersal of short-faced bears to South America. The North American carnivorans that invaded South America, including short-faced bears and Smilodon, probably quickly dominated the predatory niches formerly occupied by the native typical South American groups such as metatherian sparassodont and avian phorusrhacid carnivores. Ecology There is evidence to suggest that Arctotherium had dens.

This may happen until death, serious debility, or organ failure occurs. Some progressive diseases can be halted and reversed by treatment. Many can be slowed by medical therapy. Some cannot be altered by current treatments. Though the time distinctions are imprecise, diseases can be rapidly progressive (typically days to weeks) or slowly progressive (months to years). Virtually all slowly progressive diseases are also chronic diseases in terms of time course; many of these are also referred to as degenerative diseases. Not all chronic diseases are progressive: a chronic, non-progressive disease may be referred to as a static condition. Progressive disease can also be a clinical endpoint i.e. an endpoint in a clinical trial. Examples There are examples of slowly and rapidly progressive diseases affecting all organ systems and parts of the body. The following are some examples of rapidly and slowly progressive diseases affecting various organ systems: *Brain: Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease progresses rapidly compared to Alzheimer's disease. *Eyes: Cataracts can be static or slowly progressive. Macular degeneration is slowly progressive, while retinal detachment is rapidly progressive. *Lungs: Emphysema due to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a slowly progressive pulmonary disease. *Kidneys: Goodpasture's syndrome is a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, while diabetic glomerulosclerosis is slowly progressive. *Pancreas: Type 1 diabetes mellitus involves rapidly progressive loss of insulin secretory capacity compared to type 2 diabetes mellitus, in which the loss of insulin secretion is slowly progressive over many years. MODY 2, due to GCK mutation, is a relatively static form of reduced insulin secretion. *Joints: Both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are slowly progressive forms of arthritis. *Nerves: Essential tremor is a slowly progressive neurological disorder which is usually genetically passed down.

Life Louis Philog√®ne Brulart was born 12 May 1702, only son of Carloman Philog√®ne Brulart, Comte de Sillery (ca. 1663‚Äì1727) and his wife Mary-Louise Bigot (1662-1746); he also had a sister, Marie (1707-1771). His father commanded the Regiment de Conti but his career ended after he was badly wounded at Landen in 1693. He married Charlotte F√©licit√© Le Tellier (1708‚Äì1783), on 19 July 1722 and they had a daughter, Adelaide Felicite (1725-1785). He was also godfather to Charles-Alexis Br√ªlart (1737-1793), Comte de Genlis and acted as his guardian following the death of his parents. In 1762, Charles-Alexis married the author St√©phanie F√©licit√© (1746-1830); elected to the National Convention in 1792 as a member of the Girondins faction, he was executed with many of his colleagues in 1793. Career De Puysieux came from a family with a long and distinguished record of service to the French Crown, going back to the 14th century; his relatives included Pierre Br√ªlart (1583-1640), joint Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and War from 1617 to 1626, while his uncle Roger Br√ªlart (1640-1719) was Ambassador to Switzerland. Breda Castle, location of the 1746 Congress of Breda Like his uncle, he became a diplomat and as was then common, also held a military commission. He was promoted Brigadier general in 1734 but France was mostly at peace from 1714 to 1733 and he saw little if any active service. In 1735, he was appointed French Ambassador to the Kingdom of Naples in 1735; lost in 1713 after the Treaty of Utrecht, Bourbon Spain regained it after the 1733 to 1735 War of the Polish Succession. Although the War of the Austrian Succession began in 1740, Britain and France only formally became adversaries in 1744. Despite a series of victories in Flanders won by Marshall de Saxe, by 1746 France was close to bankruptcy. De Puysieux was appointed French plenipotentiary to the Congress of Breda, a bilateral negotiation with Britain to end the war. The French terms had been drawn up by Gabriel de Mably, who shortly afterwards fell from favour. This meant negotiations proceeded slowly, especially since the British envoy Lord Sandwich was instructed to delay, in the hope their position in Flanders would improve. In the January 1747 , Britain agreed to fund Austrian and Sardinian forces in Italy and an Allied army of 140,000 in Flanders, increasing to 192,000 in 1748. The British were well aware of France's desperate financial state and although their economy was also impacted, they were far better equipped to finance it. The British Prime Minister Newcastle hoped the death of Philip V in July 1746 would tempt Spain to end their alliance with France, an assumption that proved incorrect. De Puisieux was withdrawn, allegedly for failing to reach agreement but it was only after their defeat at Lauffeld in July 1747 that Britain proved willing to negotiate seriously. In the end, this was beneficial to his career, since no one was happy with the eventual 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. France seemed to have gained very little in return for its expenditure of money and men; the saying \\"as stupid as the peace\\" became a popular phrase in France, expressing contempt for the terms agreed at Breda and Aix-la Chapelle.

The following year, Education Insights developed other quiz games with a completely new interface independent of the Microsoft Bob framework and compatible on both Windows and Macintosh. Each game was about a specific topic: *GeoSafari Animals (October 1995) *GeoSafari Geography (1995) *GeoSafari History (1995) *GeoSafari Science (1995) *GeoSafari Knowledge Pad: The Plato Collection (2001) The games are narrated by Richie Havens.

During the gameplay a player is asked a question, provided with facts and clues and then has to pick one out of several multiple choice answers in a limited time to score points. The player would have three chances to get the question right. Upon running out of time, getting the answer wrong or choosing to show answer, the player would be shown the actual answer with no points scored. Upon completing all the questions, the player's score would be totalled. Getting a perfect score would grant the player a medal. If a player gets medals for all the sub-topics of the game topic, the player is awarded a trophy.

During World War II, the Royal Air Force was temporarily shifted to the Colombo Racecourse Airstrip. Lakshmigiri is located adjoining the airstrip, therefore it was transformed into one of the RAF headquarters in Colombo. Unfortunately, it was during this time that many ornaments, antiques, chandeliers & valuable furniture was ransacked by these British troops prior to their exodus from Sri Lanka. In 1972 under the Land Reform act, a large portion of the land surrounding Lakshmigiri was seized, and the tenants were given ownership rights. What remains today is a portion of the land that once was.  Transformation from \\"Lakshmigiri\\" to Saifee Villa  The Adamjee Lukmanjee Family are members of the Muslim Dawoodi Bohra community. They were honoured to house the Head of the Community; Syenda Taher Saifuddin on all of his five visits to Sri Lanka. Lakshmigiri housed the Syedna and his royal family. It was considered a center for the community in Sri Lanka, as it was the venue for numerous religious and cultural gatherings. On 19 June 1979, after the death of Syenda Taher Saifuddin, his heir Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, in the memory of his fathers' visits, changed the name from \\"Lakshmigiri\\" to \\"Saifee Villa\\" (where the word \\"Saifee\\" is derived from the name Saifuddin). The crown of the gates of Lakshmigiri adorns an \\"S\\" that once stood for \\"Soysa\\" family, after the name-change to \\"Saifee Villa\\", the \\"S\\" is still appropriate. Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin stayed once at Saifee Villa. The Villa hosts numerous functions, and religious gatherings. During the era of Syenda Taher Saifuddin, as a child, Mufaddal Saifuddin, began the recitation of the Quran in Saifee Villa. In the year 2007 and 2008, Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin held the 9 sermons of Ashara Mubaraka in Colombo, Sri Lanka. On both occasions, Saifee Villa was chosen as the venue for his arrival reception. Dignitaries such as Mr A. H. M. Fowzie were present at this event. In 2007, in the first sermon of Ashara Mubaraka, he stated that Saifee Villa is a \\"Historical House\\" (tareekhi makaan). Mufaddal Saifuddin arrived in Sri Lanka from Karachi on Monday 17 September 2012 and his arrival reception was held in Saifee Villa at 10pm. A large gathering of Dawoodi Bohra community of Colombo was present at this function. On Saturday 9 June 2013 Mufaddal Saifuddin arrived in Sri Lanka from Chennai. His arrival reception was held at Saifee Villa where a crowd of about 3,000 people were present. He also solemnized 7 wedding Nikahs on that day. Since then, he has visited at least once on each of his 15 visits to Sri Lanka. In popular culture The house was featured in the 1981 film Kaliyugaya by Lester James Peries.

Johnson (born 1952) is an American human resources executive and government official who served as Administrator of General Services from 2010 to 2012. Johnson resigned on April 2, 2012, following a scathing Inspector General report that revealed a \\"gross misuse of taxpayer dollars\\" on an internal conference that was \\"excessive, wasteful, and in some cases impermissible.\\"  Early life and education  Born in New Haven, Connecticut, Johnson earned a bachelor's degree in economics and history from Oberlin College in 1974. She then earned an MBA degree from the Yale School of Organization and Management.  Career  From 1979 until 1985, Johnson worked as a manager for Cummins Engine Company, first in Columbus, Indiana, and then in Jamestown, New York. She worked from 1985 until 1987 as the CFO for an architecture firm, in 1987 and 1988 as a recruiter for a staffing company, and from 1988 until 1992 as a consultant in a diversity consulting firm. During 1992, she was an executive recruiting consultant with Ben & Jerry's for several months. After working on the Clinton-Gore transition team, Johnson worked in the White House Office's Office of Presidential Personnel until October 1993, and then served as an Associate Deputy Secretary of Commerce from 1993 until 1996. In March 1996, Johnson joined the General Services Administration, working there as a chief of staff from 1996 until January 20, 2001. In November 2001, Johnson became vice president of the Council for Excellence in Government. In January 2003, she left the Council for Excellence in Government to become a director at Touchstone Consulting Group, which was purchased by SRA International in 2005. SRA then employed Johnson from March 2005 until November 2007. In late 2008, Johnson became a co-leader of the Obama transition team evaluating the GSA. Johnson left SRA to become a vice president of culture at Computer Sciences Corporation, a role she held until February 2010. In April 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Johnson to serve as the Administrator of the GSA. On June 8, 2009, Johnson's nomination was reported by United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Johnson's nomination was delayed for months after Missouri Sen. Kit Bond placed a hold on her nomination over concerns he had about why the GSA wasn't closing down the federally owned Bannister Complex outside Kansas City, Missouri and relocating staff to leased space in downtown Kansas City. On January 28, 2010, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid filed for cloture on Johnson's nomination. President Obama sharply criticized Bond and Republican senators for blocking Johnson's nomination, and complained that Republicans were blocking nominees for reasons that have nothing to do with their qualifications for their prospective jobs. While at a retreat for Democratic senators, Obama made the comments in response to a question from Sen. Patrick Leahy about his judicial nominations. Obama expanded his answer to include not just blocked judicial nominations but also executive nominations as well: The full U.S. Senate voted 82-16 for cloture on Johnson's nomination on February 4, 2010. Immediately afterward, the Senate voted 94-2 (with four abstentions) to confirm Johnson. Subsequent to the vote, the two senators voting against Johnson, Jim Bunning and Jeff Sessions, asked to change their votes to \\"yea,\\" making the confirmation vote 96-0.  Bannister Complex controversy  In a letter to Martha Johnson dated November 30, 2010, Missouri Senators Kit Bond and Claire McCaskill and Representative Emanuel Cleaver assert that GSA Public Buildings Service employees failed to ensure and maintain a safe working environment for employees and tenants at the Bannister Federal Complex in Kansas City, Missouri. The letter directed Martha Johnson to take the appropriate steps to identify those responsible for the lax safety culture at the Bannister complex and take the appropriate steps to hold those individuals accountable. The letter came after three weeks of phone calls and e-mails from NBC Action News in Kansas City to GSA media contacts. Despite numerous requests from NBC Action News for an interview with Martha Johnson regarding the health concerns at the Bannister complex, Johnson failed to respond to the requests for interviews. A Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request turned up documents that indicated senior GSA officials knew of the health concerns, including a list of more than 100 sick and dead former employees of the complex; however, senior GSA officials originally denied knowledge of the information. Emails later obtained by NBC Action News proved that high level Public Buildings Service officials had actually obtained the list of sick and dead former employees three months before the NBC investigation began. In a later FOIA request from NBC Action News, GSA also withheld a letter from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources that was critical of the GSA's investigation into contamination near a day care center at the Bannister complex. After weeks of requests for interviews, Martha Johnson failed to comment on the situation regarding GSA's withholding of information or the subsequent Inspector General report that indicated GSA officials misled employees about health concerns at the Bannister Complex. Additional investigations revealed that GSA paid $234,000 to a Kansas City public relations firm to manage negative publicity that GSA was receiving as a result of mismanagement of the investigations into the Bannister complex. As a result, Senator Claire McCaskill announced that she would launch an investigation into the use of tax dollars used by federal agencies to hire public relations consultants to \\"spin\\" their images. In a November 2010 letter to Martha Johnson, Senator McCaskill reminded GSA that \\"publicity experts\\" cannot engage in \\"publicity and propaganda\\" unless authorized by Congress and requested a detailed report of the government's use of these services.  Resignation  Johnson resigned after firing two of her top deputies on April 2, 2012, amid reports of excessive spending at a training conference at the luxury M Resort spa and casino near Las Vegas in October 2010. Four Regional Commissioners involved in organizing the four-day conference were also placed on administrative leave pending further action. The report revealed that the GSA spent $822,000 for 300 people to attend the training conference. The expenses included $147,000 in airfare and lodging at the hotel for six planning trips by a team of organizers. Among the other expenses were $3,200 for a mind reader; $6,300 on commemorative Recovery Act coin sets displayed in velvet boxes, $6,000 on canteens, keychains, T-shirts, and $75,000 on a team building exercise to build a bicycle. Additional controversial costs included $1,840 for vests for 19 \\"regional ambassadors\\" and other employees, and $393.90 for tuxedo rental for three employees who acted as masters of ceremonies at an awards dinner that cost $30,207.60. High ranking GSA officials also hosted several semi-private parties in their own hotel rooms or suites, which were catered at taxpayer expense. White House Chief of Staff Jacob J. Lew said that President Obama \\"was outraged by the excessive spending, questionable dealings with contractors, and disregard for taxpayer dollars,\\" and that he \\"called for all those responsible to be held fully accountable.\\" The White House named Dan Tangherlini to head the GSA following Johnson's resignation. F. Joseph Moravec, commissioner of GSA's Public Buildings Service during the George W. Bush administration, complained that the scandal fallout had unfairly tarnished Johnson, illustrating \\"why people with good reputations don't want to work in government.\\" According to Moravec, Johnson's resignation \\"reflects wonderfully on her character\\" since she apparently had not done anything wrong.\\" Moravec continued, \\"Political appointees are there to serve not only their country but the president, so resigning is the correct and honorable thing to do if the president is extremely displeased.\\" Later career After resigning from GSA, Johnson self-published a novel, In Our Midst, and wrote a nonfiction book, On My Watch, which has been described as \\"part autobiography and part leadership guide.\\"  References  External links *Official site Category:Human resource management people Category:Administrators of the General Services Administration Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Oberlin College alumni Category:Yale School of Management alumni Category:Politicians from New Haven, Connecticut Category:Virginia Democrats ","title":"Martha N.

He was a founding member of 8-Eyed Spy and the Raybeats, and he worked with James Chance and the Contortions, James White and the Blacks, Human Switchboard, and John Cale, among others.  Biography  George Leonard Scott III was born in Burlington, Iowa on October 16, 1953. He moved to Sarasota, Florida when he was a teenager, and attended high school there. One of his classmates was Paul Reubens, better known as Pee Wee Herman. Scott was interested in film and stage work at this point, and he was planning to pursue a career of some type in film. Scott moved to New York City around 1975. Shortly after getting there, he took an interest in the burgeoning punk music scene with bands such as Television and the Patti Smith Group. He eventually bought a bass guitar and joined Jack Ruby, a band named after the man who assassinated Lee Harvey Oswald. Jack Ruby intrigued other musicians in their scene and recorded demo tapes, including for Epic Records, that later influenced Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth. Decades later, the band was brought to the attention of the musical mainstream, and an album was issued after Scott's early roommate Gary Reese persisted in urging Scott's brother to unearth numerous tapes from the collection Scott had left in his family's possession. While trying to make a go of it in music, Scott supported himself by working in record stores, including Bleecker Bob's and the Musical Maze. After Jack Ruby dissolved around late 1977, Scott joined the Contortions, a band led by James Chance, formerly with Teenage Jesus and the Jerks. He played bass on the four tracks the Contortions had on the No New York album, produced by Brian Eno, 1978. He recorded for the album Buy, released by ZE Records in 1979, but James Chance erased his bass lines before it was released. The same year, he appeared on a No Wave \\"disco\\" album by James White and the Blacks, which was essentially the Contortions with a new name and sound. It was while working with James Chance that Scott met Jody Harris and Don Christensen, who later joined him in the Raybeats. After leaving James Chance in early 1979, Scott worked with John Cale, formerly of The Velvet Underground, playing several live gigs with him that developed into Cale's Sabotage/Live album, released in 1979. It was around this time that Scott teamed with Lydia Lunch, who had worked with Chance in Teenage Jesus to form 8-Eyed Spy, a fairly popular No Wave band that consisted of Pat Irwin, Michael Paumgarden and Jim Sclavunos. While 8-Eyed Spy was starting to garner some attention, Scott formed an instrumental band. He teamed with former Contortions Harris and Christensen and fellow 8-Eyed Spy member Pat Irwin to form the Raybeats in Fall 1979. Over the next year, the band built a following by playing several places in the New York areaA. On August 5, 1980, George Scott died from an overdose of heroin. It was a drug he had first experimented with about three years earlier when he was a member of Jack Ruby. Following Scott's death, 8-Eyed Spy ended. The Raybeats, however, continued, recruiting Danny Amis (now with Los Straitjackets) on bass. George Scott was buried in his hometown of Burlington, Iowa.

Lord Kong Zhengchi consulted the oracles of I Ching and Shu Feng of Kang's mandate in order to choose an heir of the state of Wey. The oracles and the spirit of Shu Feng favored prince Yuan, the second son of Duke Xiang. According to the religious convention, Kong Zhengchi decided to enthrone prince Yuan as the next Duke of Wey. In 535 BCE, Yuan succeeded the title of duke (Gong). Zuo Zhuan, Duke Zhao, 7th year of. In 522 BCE, Duke Ling was forced to flee to Siniao due to a sudden rebellion of his retainer Qi Bao, Beigong Xi, and Chu Shipu. In Siniao, Duke Ling received an envoy from the state of Qi (the state was not related to Qi Bao), when receiving the envoy, he admitted that he was not an apt ruler. Later, Qi Bao was assassinated by lord Beigong Xi's retainer who did not know his own lord was allied with Qi. After Qi's death, Duke Ling returned to Diqiu; the capital city of Wey. He did not punish Beigong Xi for plotting against him. Qi Bao's rebellion was caused by Duke Ling's elder brother Gongmeng Zhi who abused his power as a prince. Zhi deprived Qi of his land and gave him orders arrogantly. Qi was humiliated by Gongmeng Zhi and thus resorted to a rebellion.Zuo Zhuan, Duke Zhao, 20th year of Duke Ling's elder son prince Kuaikui attempted to murder his mother Duchess Nanzi.

This story was so widespread amongst the literati of China that the phrase \\"the bitten peach\\" became a byword for homosexuality.Hinsch, Bret. (1990). Passions of the Cut Sleeve.

The line linked Mold to Chester and it opened on 14 August 1849. The company built a mineral branch line to Ffrith, opened in November 1849. Mold itself was an important regional centre, and contained considerable mineral resources. The London and North Western Railway took over the company in 1859. As the mineral industry developed, steelmaking at Brymbo became dominant, and the LNWR arranged with the Great Western Railway to connect to that place. The passenger service closed in 1962, and in 1972 all rail activity ceased except for serving a factory at Mold; total closure followed in 1983. Formation The Mold railway The Chester and Holyhead Railway opened its route in 1848 as far as Bangor, and throughout in 1850.Peter E Baughan, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: 14: North and Mid Wales, David St John Thomas, Nairn, 1991, , pages 22 and 24 Its promoters saw the Irish Mail traffic as the dominant purpose of their line; however Mold was an important regional centre, with considerable mineral resources locally, and the Mold Railway was authorised in Parliament on 9 July 1847. The Company's capital was to be ¬£180,000, and it would run from the junction at Saltney, west of Chester to Mold, with a branch to Ffrith, where there were mineral deposits.Baughan, page 50 and 51Bill Rear, From Chester to Holyhead: the Branches, Oxford Publishing Company, Hersham, 2003, , pages 9, 15 and 16 The construction of the C&HR; main line, and in particular the Britannia Bridge, consumed all of the C&HR;'s available financial resources and more, and as many directors and shareholders were common between the C&HR; and the Mold Railway, the latter was not well provided with funds. This led to a slowing down of construction progress in 1848, and deferment of the Ffrith branch beyond Coed Talon. The C&HR; became impatient as it had been relying on this feeder to its system, and it acquired the Mold Railway Company, by the action of a clause in the Mold Company's Act of Incorporation; this was effective on 30 March 1849.Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 384 Opening Llong station in June 1980 The contractor for the construction of the line agreed to take most of his payment in shares, in effect funding the line himself, and it was opened on 14 August 1849; in common with the main part of the C&HR; it was worked by the London and North Western Railway. The line left the Chester to Holyhead line at Saltney Junction, a little west of Chester, and there were intermediate stations at Broughton, Hope and Llong. The line was long, of which the first was double track. A branch was constructed southwards from Ffrith Junction, near Padeswood, to Coed Talon, from where a private line extended to Nerquis, where there was a coal pit. The steeply graded branch line opened on 14 September 1849;Rear, page 35 part of the Parliamentary authorisation was to continue to limestone quarries at Ffrith, but for the time being that was left in abeyance. The mine and quarry owner Edward Oakley worked the branch with his own engine, Diamond. A station was opened at Padeswood (on the Mold main line) in 1851. In 1852 the C&HR; took over the branch line and the LNWR worked it. Passenger timetable Passenger services appear to have started as soon as the line opened, as the Chester railway timetable (published weekly in the Chester Chronicle) shows two trains each way between Chester and Mold as early as 17 August 1849.Chester General Railways Station, Chester Chronicle, 17 August 1849, p1 In mid-October 1849 this was increased to three trains each way.Chester General Railways Station, Chester Chronicle, 19 October 1849, p2 Bradshaw's Guide for 1850 shows the passenger train service: there were three trains each way to and from Chester on weekdays, and two on Sundays. The first class single fare was 2s 6d and the cheapest fare 1s 1d.Bradshaw's Railway Times for Great Britain and Ireland: March 1850, reprint, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2012, In the spring of 1859 the timetable was increased to 4 trains a day each way (2 on Sundays).Chester and Holyhead Railway Timetable April 1859, North Wales Chronicle, 2nd April 1859, p2 In the investigation into an accident that took place on the 9:25 Chester to Mold service in March 1868 it was reported that the John o' Gaunt locomotive (which suffered a boiler tube failure) was hauling 12 passenger coaches.Accident on the Chester and Mold Railway, Wrexham Advertiser, 21 August 1869 Takeover by the LNWR The Chester and Holyhead Railway had become increasingly beholden to the London and North Western Railway, which had been working it. The Mold Railway was a dependency of the C&HR;, and the two companies were acquired by the LNWR. The LNWR (Additional Works) Act 1858 authorised the absorption, and it took effect on 1 January 1859.The takeover was of the active railway; the Mold Railway Company remained in existence until full amalgamation in 1879.Peter E Baughan, The Chester and Holyhead Railway: volume one, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, , pages 177 and 178 Coed Talon expansion Further coal pits were opened at Coed Talon in 1861, and there was an oil production plant, the Coppa Oil Company, which opened in 1865. The oil was extracted from local coal. Early improvements When the Mold and Denbigh Junction Railway opened in 1869,Baughan, page 77 through traffic on the line was heavy, and the remaining single track at the Mold end of the main line was doubled to cope. The Ffrith line suffered from severe gradients, the ruling gradient being 1 in 40; no passenger train ever worked over the section from Ffrith Junction to Coed Talon.Rear, page 28 The LNWR decided to make a new connection to the pits around Coed Talon; by Act of 16 July 1866 the LNWR was empowered to build from a new junction near Mold (Tryddyn Junction) to join the former line near Tryddyn, including adoption of the Nerquis line. The line opened as far as Oak Pits Colliery on 16 March 1869, and on to Coed Talon on 8 July 1870; there was a triangular junction there.Baughan, page 56 Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway In 1866 the main line of the WM&CQR; opened; it ran from Wrexham to a wharf on the River Dee at Connah's Quay. Its primary traffic was to be minerals, but passenger accommodation was provided. The WM&CQR; crossed the Mold Railway near Hope. An Exchange Platform was provided on each line, although the accommodation was primitive. At first there was no access to and from the stations, other than from a train on the other line. A connecting curve was provided at the intersection by the WM&CQR;, enabling its trains to run towards Mold; however the LNWR did not encourage this incursion, and passenger traffic never used the line. Passengers were conveyed to and from Mold by horse omnibus.Boyd, pages 135 and 144 Wrexham and Minera Joint Railway The North Wales Coalfield extended southeastwards from the area, and the Great Western Railway dominated a network of branch lines in the Brymbo area served that part of the coalfield. The GWR had a route between Wrexham and Minera (where there were mineral resources), but the route had two rope- worked inclines on it. The Wrexham and Minera Railway was a satellite of the GWR, created to provide a route with easier gradients, and it opened in 1862. In 1865 the W&MR; got authorisation to build a line to Tryddyn, near Coed Talon; the objective was for the GWR to get access to the minerals around Mold. This line was called the Wrexham and Minera Extension Railway, but it was never built under that name. The following year the LNWR and the GWR agreed to build the connecting line jointly, giving the LNWR access to Brymbo, an important steel-making town on the original W&MR.; The line was retitled the Wrexham and Minera Joint Railway, although it did not approach close to either Wrexham or Minera. This change was authorised by Act of 11 June 1866.Grant, pages 628 and 629 There was some delay in building the line, and it actually opened on 27 January 1872. By this time the W&MR; had been vested in the GWR. In a further change of plan, the joint section only reached from Brymbo to a boundary about half way to Coed Talon; North-West of that point the new line was totally LNWR. The boundary was at Pantystain, immediately north-west of the level crossing on the present-day A5101 road. According to Boyd there was a boundary stone at the location.Boyd, pages 153 and 154Baughan, pages 55 and 60Rear, page 37H C Casserley, Britain's Joint Lines, Ian Allan, Shepperton, 1970, , page 139 Coed Talon changes In 1887 the Tryddyn line was closed, although it reopened in 1923. Four trains a day every weekday ran over the line from Mold to Coed Talon from 1 January 1892. They were extended to Brymbo over the Joint Line on 2 May 1898, four trains running each way daily.Baughan, page 56 Rear notes that in 1904 \\"Two goods trains each way were shown working over the Padeswood, Coppa and Coed Talon branches for the same period [July 1904], although the timings of the up trains varied between weekdays and Saturdays. On the Mold, Coed Talon & Brymbo branch there were four passenger trains each way daily, and an extra train each way on Wednesday and Saturday evenings\\". By 1919 the mineral trains had reduced to one daily.Rear, page 29 1895 passenger timetable In 1895 Mold was now the centre of a local network. The Mold to Chester service was nine trains weekdays, one additional Saturday train. Many of the trains came through from Denbigh or made a good connection from there. There was a limited stop morning train to Chester and back in the evening. There is no reference to a Sunday service. There were three daily trains, with one additional on Saturday, from Mold to Coed Talon.Bradshaw's Rail Times for Great Britain and Ireland: December 1895, reprint, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2018, Grouping of the railways In 1923 the main line railways of Great Britain were grouped, under the Railways Act 1921, into one or other of four new, larger companies. The LNWR was a consitutent of the new London Midland and Scottish Railway. Decline The original Ffrith branch (from Ffrith Junction to Coed Talon) closed on 29 July 1934, prompted by a derailment at Pontblyddyn.Rear, page 13 In 1939 there were still five daily goods trains between Mold Junction and Hope Junction for interchange with the London and North Eastern Railway (as successor to the WM&CQR;) there.Rear, page 33 The Mold to Brymbo passenger trains reduced to two per day after World War II,Rear, pages 32 and 33 but the service was discontinued on 27 March 1950, and the line from Coed Talon to Ffrith closed completely on 1 May 1952. The passenger service between Chester and Mold ceased on 30 April 1962. Ordinary goods services were progressively withdrawn in the 1960s, and after 1972 the line only carried a single specialised traffic. From 1950 there was a formaldehyde production factory at Mold, operated by Synthite Limited. In order to maintain rail connection to the company‚Äôs sidings, goods trains ran from Mold and over the WM&CQR; connection at Hope to Wrexham.

Hair is a stratified squamous keratinized epithelium made of multi-layered flat cells whose rope-like filaments provide structure and strength to the hair shaft. The protein called keratin makes up hair and stimulates hair growth. Hair follows a specific growth cycle with three distinct and concurrent phases: anagen, catagen, and telogen. Each phase has specific characteristics that determine the length of the hair. The body has different types of hair, including vellus hair and androgenic hair, each with its own type of cellular construction. This varied construction gives the hair unique characteristics, serving specific purposes, mainly warmth (redundant in modern humans) and physical protection. Most humans develop the longest thickest hair on their scalps and (mostly observed in males) faces. This hair will usually grow to several feet before terminating, but many humans develop much longer hair. Growth cycle Hair-follicle cycling Hair grows at different speeds and different lengths. Its composition causes different colors and textures, which influence how long the hair strands grow. Marianne Ernst, a German \\"Long hair model\\". The three stages of hair growth are the anagen, catagen, and telogen phases. Each strand of hair on the human body is at its own stage of development. Once the cycle is complete, it restarts and a new strand of hair begins to form. The growth rate of hair varies from individual to individual depending on their sex, age, genetic predisposition and countless environmental factors. It is commonly stated that hair grows about 1cm per month on average; however reality is more complex, since not all hair grows at once. Scalp hair is known to grow between 0.6cm and 3.36cm per month. The growth rate of scalp hair somewhat depends on age (hair tends to grow more slowly with age), sex, and ethnicity. It was previously thought that Caucasian hair grew more quickly than Asian hair and that the growth rate of women's hair was faster than that of men. However, more recent research has shown that the growth rate of hair in men and women does not significantly differ and that the hair of Chinese people grew more quickly than the hair of French Caucasians and West and Central Africans. Anagen phase The anagen phase is known as the growth phase. This is the phase where the hair physically grows approximately 1 cm per month. It begins in the papilla and can last from three to five years. The span at which the hair remains in this stage of growth is determined by genetics. The longer the hair stays in the anagen phase, the longer it will grow. During this phase, cells neighboring the papilla in a germinative layer divide to produce new hair fibers, and the follicle buries itself into the dermal layer of the skin to nourish the strand. About 85%-90% of the hairs on one's head are in the anagen phase at any given time. Catagen phase The catagen phase, also known as the transitional phase, allows the follicle to, in a sense, renew itself. During this time, which lasts about two weeks, the hair follicle shrinks due to disintegration and the papilla detaches and \\"rests,\\" cutting the hair strand off from its nourishing blood supply. Signals sent out by the body (that only selectively affect 1 percent of all hair of one's body at any given time) determine when the anagen phase ends and the catagen phase begins. The first sign of catagen is the cessation of melanin production in the hair bulb and apoptosis of follicular melanocytes. Ultimately, the follicle is 1/6 its original length, causing the hair shaft to be pushed upward. While hair is not growing during this phase, the length of the terminal fibers increases when the follicle pushes them upward. Telogen phase During the telogen or resting phase (also known as shedding phase) the follicle remains dormant for one to four months. Ten to fifteen percent of the hairs on one's head are in this phase of growth at any given time. In this phase, the epidermal cells lining the follicle channel continue to grow as normal and may accumulate around the base of the hair, temporarily anchoring it in place and preserving the hair for its natural purpose without taxing the body's resources needed during the growth phase. At some point, the follicle will begin to grow again, softening the anchor point of the shaft initially. The hair base will break free from the root and the hair will be shed. Within two weeks, the new hair shaft will begin to emerge once the telogen phase is complete. The process results in normal hair loss known as shedding. Growth inhibitors and disorders In most people, scalp hair growth will halt due to follicle devitalization after reaching a length of generally two or three feet. Exceptions to this rule can be observed in individuals with hair development abnormalities, which may cause an unusual length of hair growth. Chemotherapy Most chemotherapy drugs work by attacking rapidly dividing cells. Rapid cell replication is one of the hallmarks of cancer; however, hair follicle cells also grow and divide quickly. Consequently, the chemotherapy drugs usually inhibit hair growth. The dose and type of medicine will determine the severity of hair loss. Once the course of chemotherapy has ended, new hair growth may begin after three to 10 weeks. Hair loss Alopecia is a hair loss disease that can occur in anyone at any stage of life. Specifically Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease that causes hair to spontaneously fall out. It is mainly characterized by bald patches on the scalp or other parts of the body, and can ultimately cause baldness across the entire body. This disease interferes with the hair growth cycle by causing a follicle to prematurely leave the anagen, or active growth, phase and enter the resting, or telogen, phase. The hair growth in the affected follicles is lessened or stopped completely. Traction alopecia is caused by adding too much strain on the hair on one's head. Tight ponytails and other styles that require added tension to the hair are often what cause this disease. It can also occur on the face in areas where the hair is often styled. Plucking or waxing one's eyebrows frequently, for example, can yield suppressed hair growth in the area. On the scalp, the hair is usually known to be lost around the hair line, leaving the densest amount of hair at the crown. Small vellus hair will often replace the hair that is lost. Radiation therapy to the head Human hair follicles are very sensitive to the effects of radiation therapy administered to the head, most commonly used to treat cancerous growths within the brain. Hair shedding may start as soon as two weeks after the first dose of radiation and will continue for a couple of weeks. Hair follicles typically enter the telogen phase, and regrowth should commence 2.5 to 3 months after the hair begins to shed. Regrowth may be sparser after treatment. UV-B UV levels of either 20 or 50 mJ cm‚àí2 in the UV-B range have been shown to inhibit hair growth, reduce hair melanin and damage hair follicles.

Although it was never a political unit there is some reason for treating it as a distinct region. The Volga marks the approximate northern limit of moderately dense settlement. The area to the north was valued mainly as a source of fur. The western side was the main source of squirrel, for which there was a large demand during the Middle Ages. Luxury fur, especially sable, came mostly from the northeast. Last glacial period The Weichselian glaciation that came to cover much of northwestern originated most likely from small ice fields and ice caps in the Scandinavian Mountains before the ice spread eastward. In northwestern Russia the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet reached its Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) extent 17 ka BP, five thousand years later than in Denmark, Germany and Western Poland. In Russia the LGM ice margin was highly lobate. Lobes originated as result of ice flow following shallow topographic depressions filled with soft sediment substrate. The whole of the basins of the Lake Ladoga, Lake Onega and the White Sea were glaciated at the time of the LGM. These basins possibly canalized the Weschelian ice into streams that feed the lobes found further east and south. Highlands made up of hard bedrock like Valdai and Tihvin had the opposite effect of diverting ice into basins. The three main lobes of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet in Russia during the LGM followed the basins of Rybisnk and the rivers of Dvina, Vologda. By 13 ka BP the ice margin had receded towards the west and northwestso that all of Lake Ladoga, Lake Onega were free of glacier ice as was almost all of the White Sea and the Kola Peninsula. As the ice margin continued to recede towards the west despite occasional re-advances by 10.6 years BP the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet had left Russia. North of the Kandalaksha Gulf, in Murmansk Oblast, the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet was mostly cold based while south of the gulf it was warm based. Geography Before modern times most transport was by river. Therefore, much of its history and geography depends on the river system. From the site of Saint Petersburg one route runs south to the Black Sea and a shorter one goes to the headwaters of the Volga. The east-west routes are the Volga, the Sukhona route across the center, a northerly route parallel to the Arctic coast and the Arctic. The Northern Dvina drains the center and flows northeast into the White Sea. In the east the Pechora River flows northwest-north to the Arctic and the Kama River flows southwest to the Volga bend at Kazan. The Volga-Baltic Waterway.The four lakes are Ladoga, Onega, the small Lake Beloye and the Rybinsk Reservoir. East of Beloye is the long Lake Kubenskoye Pechora River. The Usa River flows west from the Urals and joins the west-flowing part of the Pechora. The Izhma flows north to meet the Pechora bend. The Tsilma meets the Pechora bend from the west. Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks: (this was the main axis of Kievan Rus'). From the site of Saint Petersburg (founded in 1703) east up the Neva River to Lake Ladoga, south up the Volkhov River past Staraya Ladoga to Novgorod (founded 860 or before), south across Lake Ilmen and south up the Lovat River. From the Lovat portage to the headwaters of the Western Dvina, portage to the upper Dnieper River and south to Kiev and the Black Sea. From portages around the Lovat one could go west down the Western Dvina to Riga or east to the upper Volga River. Volga- Baltic Waterway: Gulf of Finland, Neva River to Lake Ladoga, then northeast up the Svir River to Lake Onega, southeast up the Vytegra River, portage, down the Kovzha River to Lake Beloye and southeast down the Sheksna River to Rybinsk at the northernmost point of the Volga River. Today the entire route is canalized and the lower Sheksna is part of the Rybinsk Reservoir. The Northern Dvina Canal branches northeast to the Sukhona River (next section). The Sukhona Route and Veliky Ustyug: This route crosses the center along the Sukhona and Vychegda Rivers which join near Veliky Ustyug and links Novgorod to the Kama River and Kazan. From Veliky Ustyug one can go west up the Sukhona, east up the Vychegda, northwest down the Northern Dvina to the White Sea, or south up the Yug River and down the Unzha River to the Volga and Kazan. From the upper Sheksna south of Lake Beloye, portage to the ? river and downstream to Lake Kubenskoye. (This is now the Northern Dvina Canal. Vologda is just south of lake Kubenskoye.) From Lake Kubenskoye east northeast down the Sukhona River about 400 km to Veliky Ustyug where the Yug River comes in from the south. The river now gains the name of Northern Dvina and flows about 60 km northeast to the modern town of Kotlas where the Vychegda River comes in from the east. From Kotlas east at least 400 km up the Vychegda to its headwaters west of the Urals. From here portage north to the Pechora or south to the Kama, both of which lead to passes over the Urals. Northern East-West Route: This was the main axis of Novgorod's expansion. It skirts the southeast side of the White Sea and then crosses to the Pechora. Lake Onega, east up the Vodla River, portage to the Onega River basin, east across this, portage, down the Northern Dvina to Kholmogory near the White Sea, east up the Pinega River, portage to the Kuloy and north to the Mezen Bay of the White Sea. East up the Pyoza River, portage, down the Tsilma River to the west-flowing part of the Pechora. Pechora River and Ural Passes: 1. From the northern east-west route up the west-flowing part of the Pechora River, up the Usa River, over the easy Kamen portage of the Urals and down the short Sob River to the lower Ob River. 2. From the middle Pechora, up the Shchugor River, over either of two Ural passes and down the Northern Sosva to the Ob. 3. From the upper Pechora, over the Urals and down the Pelym River. 4. From the headwaters of the Vychegda to branches of the upper Kama River, across the middle Urals and down branches of the Tavda River to Tobolsk on the Ob. North-South Routes: 1. From Kazan northeast up the Kama River, portage to the Pechora or Vyshegda. 2. From Kazan up the Volga past Nizhny Novgorod to the point where the river turns from east to south, north up the Unzha River, portage, down the Yug River to Veliky Ustyug. 3. From the middle Vychegda, north up the Vym River, portage, east down the Ukhta River, north up the Izhma River to the Pechora. 4. From Moscow one route was northwest up the Moskva River to Volokolamsk and down the Lama River and Shosha River to the Volga. This was replaced by the current Moscow Canal further east. Peoples Peoples in the ninth century (partial) Russians expanded slowly from the south. Those along the White Sea came to be called Pomors. The original population spoke Uralic languages. The Chuds were proto-Estonians. The Ves' lived east Lake Ladoga and were pushed toward the Dvina by the expansion of Novgorod after 1100. The Vychegda Permians lived on the Vychegda while the state of Great Perm was on the upper Kama. The Permians were later called Zyryans and later Komi. The Arabic term Wisu probably meant Great Perm, but it might have referred to the Ves'. The Voguls lived on the upper Kama and Pechora and the Ostyaks or Yugra on the lower Pechora. The Samoyeds lived in the far northeast. The Burtas were ancestors of the Mordvins. Zavolochye (meaning \\"beyond the portage\\") is a geographic term referring to some of the area between Lake Onega and the lower Dvina. History Since this thinly-peopled area developed no significant states, its history is mostly about states south of the Volga and their attempts to control the northern fur trade. By Date: circa 800: Volga Bulgaria. c 860: Kievan Rus'. by 1096: whole area under Russian tribute except Bulgars. 1212: Veliky Ustyug founded. 1221: Russia takes Nizhny Novgorod from Bulgars. 1240: Mongols conquer Russia. 1445: Kazan independent. 1460: Moscow controls the northeast. 1478: Moscow takes Novgorod. 1480: Moscow independent from the Golden Horde. 1552: Moscow takes Kazan. 1582: Conquest of Siberia begins. The Volga Bulgars and Kazan: Persian coins found in the Kama region dating from the fifth to the seventh century imply that something was being exported down the Volga at that time. Volga Bulgaria was established on the Volga bend near Kazan about 800. They collected tribute from the neighboring tribes and in turn paid tribute to the Khazars on the lower Volga. About 922 they adopted Islam (about 66 years before the Rus' became Christian). They blocked the Rus' from sailing down the Volga but bought Rus' furs and resold them to merchants coming upriver from Khazaria and central Asia. In 965 the Rus' destroyed the Khazar empire. There were numerous Rus'-Bulgar wars, with the border being roughly from Rostov southeast to Murom. About 1150 the rising power of Rostov reduced Bulgar fur supplies and forced its trade north to what later became Veliky Ustyug. In 1236 the Volga Bulgaria was conquered and devastated by the Mongols, but later Mongol demand for tribute increased its fur trade as did the destruction of the Kiev trade. By 1300-1350 it had an active trade extending up the Kama to Great Perm and Yugra. After 1350 the breakdown of the Golden Horde made the Volga route difficult, Muscovite expansion to the Vyshegda reduced fur supplies and Novgorodian pirates called \\"ushkuiniks\\" raided the northern rivers. In 1445 the area became independent as the Khanate of Kazan and developed a trade in luxury fur from the northeast and Siberia down the Volga, but Moscow controlled the lands further north. There were many Russo-Kazan Wars, but Kazan also sold fur to Moscow. Moscow conquered Kazan in 1552. thumb The Rus': Around 862 Scandinavians arrived in Russia via the Gulf of Finland and the Western Dvina. They quickly adopted the local Slavic languages and became known as Rus'. They built a system of principalities from the Volga south to the steppe and traded south to Byzantium and eastward to the Bulgars. Novgorod: In 1096 Novgorod was collecting tribute as far northeast as the Pechora. By 1350 its claim to rule the Yugra and Perm areas was recognized by the other Russian states. It built a series of \\"Pogosts\\" or forts along the \\"northern east-west route\\", reaching the Pinega by 1137, and used them to collect tribute from the local population. From around 1150 it pushed south to the upper Sukhona and used this route to trade with the Bulgars and also for some raiding. About 1200 Veliky Ustyug was founded by the ruler of Rostov, partially blocking this route. From about 1200 Germans colonized the Baltic coast from Estonia to East Prussia. Byzantium declined after 1204 and the Mongols destroyed Kiev in 1240. The effect was to reorient Novgorod's trade westward and partly separate it from the rest of Rus'. Novgorod became the eastern anchor of the Hanseatic League and its government became dominated by its merchants. Instead of exporting Byzantine and Arab luxury goods to Scandinavia, it exported fur via Hanseatic merchants to western Europe. The main export was grey squirrel for which there was a large demand during the Middle Ages. This reliance on squirrel partly explains why Novgorod relinquished the northeastern sources of luxury fur to Moscow. From about 1320 we began to hear of landed estates and peasant communities in an area that almost reached the Dvina, a system that was well-developed by 1450. Boyars received about half their rent in fur. From about 1440 the Novgorod fur trade broke up. Western demand for squirrel declined and Moscow controlled the sources of luxury fur east of the White Sea. Moscow annexed Novgorod in 1478 and systematically broke up her commercial institutions. Rostov-Suzdal: By about 1150 Rostov had enough control of the upper Volga to block direct trade between the Bulgars and Novgorod. From 1164 to 1221 Suzdalia pushed east to the mouth of the Oka River. This gave them control of the Volga from Yaroslavl north of Rostov to the mouth of the Oka at Nizhny Novgorod (founded in 1221) and the Unzha-Yug route from the Volga to Ustyug (founded about 1212) which the Bulgars had previously controlled and gave them some control over Novgorod's Sukhona route. From around 1400 we hear of Rostov granting estates west of the lower Dvina in what was Novgorod territory. Muscovy: About 1328 Ivan Kalita of Moscow gained control of Ustyug and Belozersk and used it to tax Novgorod's fur trade in order to collect wealth which he sent in tribute to the Golden Horde. From about 1350 Moscow developed its own fur trade and gained increasing control over the Perm-Pechora region. About 1363 it gained some control over Rostov and from 1367 some control over Perm. About 1376-86 Saint Stephan of Perm converted the Vyshegda Permyaks to Christianity which had the indirect effect of bringing the region under the control of Moscow. In 1397-1425 Moscow tried to reach the lower Dvina but was pushed back by Novgorod. Around 1400 the weakening of the Golden Horde shifted the fur trade from tribute down to Volga to commercial exchange through Crimea. By 1462 Moscow controlled Vologda, the eastern side of the White Sea and the lower Dvina. About 1458 Moscow gained control over the Vyatka River branch of the Kama, thereby reducing Kazan's control of the north. After 1472 tribute from Great Perm was increased. In 1465 Moscow imposed tribute on Yugra. In 1483 Muscovites under Fyodor Kurbsky raided across the Urals down the Pelym River into the lands of the Khanate of Sibir. In 1499 Muscovites use the 'northern east-west route' to attack the Samoyeds and sent parties across the Urals to Pelym. From around 1500 there were increasing overland exports of luxury fur to Western Europe. In 1566 the Stroganovs were granted extensive lands around Perm. In 1582 Yermak began the Russian conquest of Siberia. Many, perhaps most, of the explorers of Siberia came from northwest Russia.

The Breda company later acquired the rights to it. Design and development An engineer named Tebaldi designed the Tebaldi-Zari, which was a single-seat wooden sesquiplane with heavily staggered wings and a Isotta Fraschini V.6, water-cooled 6-cylinder in-line engine, driving a two-bladed tractor propeller. Its fixed, tailskid landing gear was of very unusual configuration; the main gear was of very wide track and had oversized main wheels with their axle incorporated into the lower wing. The Zari brothers' factory in Bovisio Mombello, Milan, manufactured the Tebaldi-Zari prototype in 1919, but Breda soon bought both the prototype and the design rights to the aircraft from Zari. Breda re-engined the prototype with a Hispano-Suiza HS-42 V-8 water- cooled engine. In 1922 and drafted an agreement with the Italian government to produce three more aircraft, but no production order followed. Undaunted, Breda modified the original prototype by arming it with two fixed, forward- firing Vickers machine-guns, modifying its upper wing so that it had a longer span and narrower chord, reducing the wing stagger, increasing the gap between the upper wing and fuselage, and increasing the angle of the outer struts so that they attached to the axle of the main wheels allowing the outer wing panels to be removed whenever a desire existed to test the Tebaldi-Zari as a sesquiplane. After these modifications were complete, Breda set about another redesign of the aircraft, this time increasing the size of the ailerons and the chord of the upper wing and removing the outer panels of the lower wing permanently. Thus modified, the original Tebaldi-Zari prototype was entered in the Italian 1923 fighter contest. The Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) took no interest in a production order, and no further aircraft were built.

The most common cause of carotidynia may be migraine, and then it is usually self-correcting. Common migraine treatments may help alleviate the carotidynia symptoms. Recent histological evidence has implicated an inflammatory component of carotidynia, but studies are limited. Carotid arteritis is a much less common cause of carotidynia, but has much more serious consequences. It is a form of giant cell arteritis, which is a condition that usually affects arteries in the head. Due to this serious condition possibly causing carotidynia, and the possibility that neck pain is related to some other non-carotidynia and serious condition, the case should be investigated by a medical doctor. Because carotidynia can be caused by numerous causes, Biousse and Bousser in 1994 recommended the term not be used in the medical literature.Available here However, recent MRI and ultrasound studies have supported the existence of a differential diagnosis of carotidynia consistent with Fay's characterization.Lee TC, Swartz R, McEvilly R, Aviv RI, Fox AJ, Perry J, Symons SP.

Consisting of the remnants of a burial mound and a prehistoric village, the site lies on both sides of Camp Resort Road in Beale Township, near the community of Beale. Archaeology Since the first white settlement of Juniata County, the area now named the Book Site has been known as a location of prehistoric interest; local tradition held that it was once occupied by an Indian fort. By the middle of the nineteenth century, skeletons were being removed from the mound as the result of cultivation, and individuals periodically dug in the mound into the 1920s. A professional investigation of the site was conducted in the summer and autumn of 1929; the archaeologists discovered a wide range of pottery, many projectile points, and a large number of bones, including twenty-two skulls. The combination of artifacts and the site's location slightly above a large stream have led to its identification as a work of the Clemson Island culture (AD 700-1300)Miller, Randall M., and William Pencak. Pennsylvania: A History of the Commonwealth. University Park: Penn State UP, 2002, 22. during the early Late Woodland period. Fields to the north and east of the mound have also been known to produce small artifacts, such as stone chips and flakes. Unlike the mound, the surrounding fields have never been excavated professionally; however, as all other known mounds of the Clemson Island culture are associated with villages, the presence of the artifacts in the fields indicates that a village site was once located in the fields to the north of the mound. Significance Comparison with similar sites in New York indicates that the Book Site is among the earliest Late Woodland sites in central Pennsylvania. Moreover, the large amount of Clemson Island pottery makes it a type site for this kind of pottery; consequently, the Book Site is a prime archaeological site. In 1986, the site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of its archaeological value.

A small number of reports in the primary scientific literature support the possibility of several medical uses, but pending confirmation they must be evaluated cautiously. Atractylodes rhizomes showed possible hepatoprotective activity in an in vitro assay of a hepatocyte cell line treated with carbon tetrachloride or galactosamine, with significant hepatoprotective activity from the isolated sesquiterpenoid components atractylon, Œ≤-eudesmol, and hinesol. One review stated that the volatile oil contains the important chemical components, and that Œ≤-eudesmol and hinesol are its active ingredients. Compounds isolated from a hexane extract of A. lancea included atractylochromene, a potent inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase (IC50 3.3 Œºmol L‚àí1) and cyclooxygenase (IC50 0.6 Œºmol L‚àí1); 2-[(2E)-3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienyl]-6-methyl-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-dione, a selective inhibitor of lipoxygenase (IC50 0.2 Œºmol L‚àí1); atractylon and osthol, weak inhibitors of lipoxygenase, and atractylenolides I, II, and III. Atractylenolide I from bai zh√∫ was reported to help with cachexia (a side effect of stomach cancer) and alter cytokine levels in a small non-blinded study. It was found to bind competitively with lipopolysaccharide for cell surface receptors with IC50 values of 5 to 7 Œºmol L‚àí1 for inhibiting TNF-Œ±, IL-1Œ≤, and nitric oxide production.

The San Miguelito Oil Field is a large and currently productive oil field in the hills northwest of the city of Ventura in southern California in the United States. The field is close to the coastline, with U.S. Highway 101 running past at the base of the hills, and is sandwiched between the larger Ventura Oil Field to the east and the Rincon Oil Field, which is partially offshore, to the north and northwest. Discovered in 1931, and with about 7 million barrels of oil remaining out of its original 125 million, it ranks 44th in the state by size, and at the beginning of 2009 had 61 producing oil wells, all operated by Vintage Production California LLC, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum. p. 63, 165 Geographic setting A part of the San Miguelito Field, from the north-northwest, viewed from the air. The oil field is one of several following the east-west trend of the Transverse Ranges: to the west is the Rincon Oil Field and the offshore Dos Cuadras field, and to the east the much larger Ventura Oil Field. Total productive area of the field, projected to the surface, encompasses about , about one and a half square miles.California Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR).

PDF file available on CD from www.consrv.ca.gov. p. 574 On the coast between Ventura and Carpinteria, the stretch known locally as \\"the Rincon\\", the hills rise steeply from the shore, with the coastal U.S. Highway 101 occupying much of the narrow strip between the beach and the sharply rising hills. A cluster of seaside homes is on the ocean side of Highway 101 at Solimar Beach (marked as \\"Dulah\\" on the USGS topographic map of the area). One of the field's pumpjacks is visible on the mountain side of the highway, at sea level, just north of the Solimar Beach exit; almost all the other oil wells are out of the line of sight from any public road, as are the other oilfield structures (tank farms, processing units, and others). The predominant vegetation in the hills is chaparral and coastal sage scrub. Terrain on the hills is steep, and the unpaved access roads make numerous switchbacks. Some of the hillsides are bare where landslides have stripped them, and the terrain in this area is unusually prone to landslides. Climate in the area is Mediterranean, with cool, rainy winters and mild, dry summers, cooled by morning coastal clouds. Elevations on the field range from sea level to over on the highest ridgetops. Runoff from the oil field is west and southwest down ephemeral, seasonal drainages into the Pacific Ocean. Geology Detail of the San Miguelito field, showing adjacent oil fields. Red dots are locations of active oil wells as of 2008. The San Miguelito field is an accumulation of oil along the westernmost portion of the Ventura Anticline, bounded on the north by the Grubb Thrust Fault, where the fault has pushed another closed anticline above the end of the Ventura Anticline.Haines, R.B. San Miguelito Oil Field. 1970 Petroleum- bearing units are sands of Pliocene and Miocene age, and are given numerical designations increasing with depth: 1st Grubb, 2nd Grubb, down to 5th Grubb (as well as an additional \\"Grubb D\\" zone for units lower than 5th Grubb). These units are present on either side of the fault, but are offset by about 4,000 vertical feet.DOGGR, p. 454 It is a deep reservoir, with the uppermost producing unit at an average depth of below ground surface, and the lowest over deep.DOGGR, p. 455 The California Department of Conservation groups together the Grubb 1-3 zones, Grubb 4-5 zones, Grubb D (Deep) zones as three distinct producing horizons.DOGGR 2009, p. 101. The oil is medium-grade with an API gravity of 31 in the first four Grubb zones, 25 in the 5th. History, production and operations While the adjacent large Ventura Avenue oil field was discovered in 1919, it was not until 1931 that prospectors thought of searching for oil near the western end of the Ventura Anticline, where the borehole had to reach a considerable depth before finding oil. The discovery well for the field was the Continental Oil Co. \\"Grubb No. 1\\", which reached below ground surface, drilling from a ridgeline about a half mile from the ocean, about above sea level. It flowed over 600 barrels a day, and development of the field began. In 1944 the 2nd Grubb Zone was discovered, and in 1950, the 3rd Grubb. Peak production from the field was in 1951 at 4.5 million barrels of oil. Further zones were discovered, with the 4th Grubb coming online in 1970, and the 5th Grubb in 1979. By 1983, the deepest well was already producing from . In order to increase reservoir pressure, several waterflooding projects have been undertaken on the field, commencing in 1955. Most of the water injection has been done in the Grubb 1-3 zones; only one waterflood well was active as of 2009 in Grubb 4-5, with 31 in Grubb 1-3.DOGGR 2009, p. 188 In 1993, Vintage Petroleum acquired both the San Miguelito and adjacent Rincon fields from Mobil, Conoco, and Santa Fe Energy.

The economics of crime in Ohio  The above image depicts the average number of Ohioans incarcerated per 100,000 citizens in the state. The steepest increase occurred between 1980-1995, with numbers plateauing between 2007-2015.  Taxation and the Ohio prison system  The Ohio prison system is the sixth largest state prison system in the United States, and it is operated by the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. As of 2015, the cost per prisoner was approximately $69 per day. As of November 2016, Ohio's prison population consisted of 51,064 inmates. Overcrowding in prisons has been an issue in the state, with that rate sitting at 132.1% in 2016. The funding of the criminal justice field by the state has been on the decline (a cut of $150 million in the last ten years), and prisons are receiving less money as the prison population is growing. The rates of violent crime in Ohio have decreased throughout the last few years, but the prison population has not decreased with the reduction in violent crime. Nationally, states contribute about 5% of their overall funds to the corrections field. Nurses have been logging in more overtime hours in the Ohio prison system, and it is costing the state's taxpayers millions of dollars. Potential nursing candidates do not want to work in the correctional environment, and supply is not meeting demand. With a shortage of nurses, there is no choice but to send those already hired into overtime pay to properly supply inmates with the care they need.  Socioeconomic status and crime  Ohio's unemployment rate was 4.6% as of August 2018, with its highest rate of unemployment occurring in January 2010 (11.1%). There are racial disparities in Ohio's prison system, with African Americans and Latinos being overrepresented compared to the underrepresented number of whites. In 2010, African Americans were over five times more likely to be incarcerated than whites in Ohio, and Latinos were two times more likely than whites. Studies show that high rates of crime and poverty are usually located within the same geographical areas. These studies indicate that where there is unemployment, there is poverty, and where there is poverty, there are often minorities. Research also shows that inequalities among races can influence the crime rate within a given area.  Employment in the criminal justice system of Ohio  As of May 2016, Ohio employed 74,090 jobs relating to the Criminal Justice field. The highest paying job in the field was that of a lawyer (14,960 employed in the state), making a mean annual wage of $105,520. Law clerks (1,460 employed in the state) were the lowest paid employees, making a mean annual wage of $35,740.  Issue 1  Issue 1 was on the ballot in the November 2018 general election in Ohio, and it included reformed sentencing for drug offenses. If it had been passed by the voters of Ohio, drug offenders would have been charged with misdemeanors instead of felonies, and drug offenders on probation could not be sent to prison because of a violation of their probation that was non-criminal. If Issue 1 had been implemented, the state would have been required to utilize the money it saved from the decline of inmates on new programs that help rehabilitate offenders in a more productive manner. Issue 1 was not passed by the voting citizens of Ohio. Polling results yielded an approval rate of 36.6% and a rejection rate of 63.4%. Capital punishment laws Capital punishment is applied in Ohio.

He was first recorded in the work Han Fei Zi, by Legalist philosopher Han Fei, as the companion of the historical figure Duke Ling of Wei. While Mizi Xia may have actually existed, nothing is known about him beyond this story. Mizi Xia was the favored courtier of Duke Ling because of his beauty. When Mizi Xia got news that his mother was ill, he forged an order from the Duke to use a ducal carriage to travel quickly to see her, and was praised for his filial piety. Another time, Mizi Xia bit into an especially delicious peach and gave the remainder to the Duke as a gift so he could taste it as well. Both acts ingratiated him further with the ruler. However, once Mizi Xia's looks faded, the Duke turned against him, claiming he stole the carriage and then insulted the Duke by offering him a half-eaten peach.Hinsch, Bret. (1990). Passions of the Cut Sleeve. Published by the University of California Press. pp. 20‚Äì22. Han Fei's primary goal in telling the story was to caution courtiers against getting too close to fickle rulers, but in later Chinese literature Mizi Xia became more alluded to for his beauty and his homosexuality. The phrase \\"bitten peach\\" became a byword for homosexuality and Mizi Xia became a byword for a young man desired as a sexual partner. Similar allusions would be later be applied to the \\"passion of the cut sleeve\\" and the Han dynasty courtier Dong Xian.Hinsch, Bret. (1990). Passions of the Cut Sleeve. Published by the University of California Press. p. 53. Ruan Ji was one of the more famous poets to laud Mizi Xia in his writing. The Liang dynasty poet Liu Zun wrote, \\"Favors of the cut sleeve are generous,/ Love of the half-eaten peach never dies,\\" confident that any educated person reading the poem would know exactly to whom he alluded.Hinsch, Bret. (1990). Passions of the Cut Sleeve. Published by the University of California Press. pp. 73. The earliest extant Chinese document to address homosexuality, the \\"Poetical Essay on the Supreme Joy\\" by Bo Xingjian, lists Mizi Xia amongst the famous examples of homosexuality: \\"Mizi Xia shared a peach with his lord\\".Hinsch, Bret. (1990). Passions of the Cut Sleeve. Published by the University of California Press. p. 84. By the 12th century, male companions no longer tended to wield great power at the ducal or imperial courts, and the name Mizi Xia had become associated with common male prostitutes.Hinsch, Bret. (1990). Passions of the Cut Sleeve. Published by the University of California Press. p. 93. The narrowing of gender roles under the Qing dynasty and the influence of homophobic attitudes from the West would eventually make mention of \\"the bitten peach\\" completely taboo, so that today Mizi Xia is mostly unknown inside China.Hinsch, Bret. (1990). Passions of the Cut Sleeve. Published by the University of California Press. p. 161. Mizi Xia's story became known to the broader world through the writings of Europeans such as in Sexual Life in Ancient China by Robert van Gulik. This book quotes from the early-20th century Xiangyan congshu or \\"Collected writings on fragrant elegance\\", which itself drew on earlier precedents such as those mentioned above.Hinsch, Bret.

History  Walther was founded and built in its present location with the support of Lutheran congregations in the western suburbs. St. Paul Melrose park had purchased the land from Superior Street to Iowa Street at a relatively low cost. Since St. Paul was planning on building a new church and school, they wanted to sell this land to get funds for their building project. There were several laymen from the surrounding congregations who played a key role in development of Walther. Most prominent was Bill Bussert of St. Paul, who built a log cabin on the property which could be used for church purposes, and to show the community that they were serious about building a high school there. The Lutheran High School Association wanted to name the new school Luther West to match the Chicago schools (Luther South and Luther North) but that idea met strong opposition from several of the academy's founders. They brainstormed with other leaders and came up with Walther Lutheran High School after C.F.W. Walther, the first president of the LCMS, and because the congregation youth groups in those days were called Walther Leagues. The nickname ‚ÄúBroncos‚Äù came because Walther was the school ‚Äúout west.‚Äù There were 34 sophomores and 72 freshmen that first year at Walther. The initial classes in September 1954 were held at Concordia College in River Forest as the building in Melrose Park was not completed.

In 2017, Piotr GƒÖsiorek and colleagues restored it as a distinct taxon and elevated it to species level: E. mongoliensis. GƒÖsiorek and colleagues also classified E. filamentosus and E. glaber as junior synonyms of E. testudo. Distribution It is found throughout most of the Palaearctic, and has been recorded in all continents except Antarctica and Australia. Most reports are Holarctic. Locations where it has been recorded include: Denmark, Egypt, the Faroe Islands, France, Germany, Greece, Greenland, Israel, Italy, Morocco, Iberia, Mongolia, and China. Doy√®re based his description off specimens collected in Paris. The neotype designated by GƒÖsiorek and colleagues was collected in Paris's Montmartre Cemetery.

The association began when a group of primarily European counselors met and approached the National Association of College Admissions Counseling (NACAC) about the creation of an affiliate regional organization that would represent overseas counselors. OACAC became a chartered regional association. Membership is a privilege made available to eligible institutions, organizations, agencies and individuals as defined in the association‚Äôs Bylaws. OACAC is a not-for-profit organization (taxpayer ID 141-82-7265). The membership is made up of nearly 600 professionals from around the world who advise students as they make choices about pursuing postsecondary education. OACAC members can be primary and secondary school counselors, independent counselors, college admission and financial aid officers, enrollment managers, and organizations engaged in guiding students through the secondary to higher education transition process.http://new.oacac.com/ History The conception of Overseas ACAC began with Gene Wallach, Counselor at the International School of Geneva. In the early 1970s, the European Council of International Schools (ECIS) was a small organization but colleges in the US were beginning to realize that students in ECIS schools were well qualified potential applicants. There was already a steady flow of students going to the US and recruitment staff from American universities were already visiting ECIS schools. At the NACAC conference in St. Louis in the early 1980s a meeting was held to find a solution. Although there was continued interest and Frank Burtnett, the new Executive Director of NACAC attended an ECIS conference in Amsterdam to continue the dialogue, there seemed to be no solution to the difficulty posed by the NACAC by-laws denying membership to proprietary schools. The idea was on the point of being abandoned when a representative of the US State Department encouraged the members to continue and introduced them to Joyce Smith who was asked to help progress the issue. The group continued to grow as more counselors from Europe began to attend NACAC conferences. At the NACAC National Conference in New York City a small group of international counselors met together to discuss common concerns. With Joyce Smith‚Äôs strong support and encouragement, the project moved ahead and at the 1992 conference in Los Angeles, Regina Manley, President of NACAC that year, proposed the amendment admitting proprietary schools to NACAC with the condition that the schools were accredited. The Amendment was approved and Overseas ACAC was established.

During the summer, he competed in the 2008 Sydney International Piano Competition in Sydney, Australia, where he finished as a semi-finalist and won the category for playing a Franz Liszt study piece (√©tude), and was given a prize for the \\"Best Performance of a 21st Century Work in Stage 1.\\" Yo-Yo Ma with Albright in December 2008 On December 1, the pianist performed for the first time with cellist Yo-Yo Ma at the Harvard ceremony presenting the late Senator Ted Kennedy with an Honorary Doctorate degree. At the ceremony, guests included Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, Senator John Kerry, and then Vice- President-Elect Joe Biden. 2009 In February, Albright competed in the IV Minnesota International Piano-e-Competition, performing at a piano salon in New York City, but he was not selected to continue after this preliminary round. Albright competed at the Top of the World International Piano Competition in Norway in June 2009. He rose through the first round to compete in the second round but he was not one of the top three finishers. He competed in the Vendome Prize International Piano Competition in Vienna and, though he was not selected among the top five finishers, he was given a special award by pianist and jury member Elisabeth Leonskaja. In October, Albright gave a concert and taught his first master class at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington, as a guest artist for the Sanford Piano Series. Albright was one of four winners of the 2009 Young Concert Artists International Auditions where he won the Paul A. Fish First Prize, the Ruth Laredo Award, the Sander Buchman Prize, the Ronald A. Asherson Prize, and the Sander Buchman Prize, as well as four performance prizes. Albright performed approximately 28 times in the 2009-2010 Concert Season.

Albright was granted $15,000 with an additional $10,000 for the commissioning of a new composition for piano. He gave six concerts as a 2010 Gilmore Young Artist at the 2010 Gilmore Keyboard Festival in Michigan, where he received a review describing his playing as \\"Poetry in motion... with flair as well as fireworks... Maturity might be a given for a Gilmore Young Artist. But Albright's professional polish was evident, not simply in the way he played the piece, but in the manner he played with the orchestra, as opposed to against or merely alongside it.\\" The review concluded that \\"This college kid... is going places in music,\\" and that \\"In Royce Auditorium on Thursday, Albright was number one all the way.\\" 2010 In Salt Lake City in June, Albright competed in the XV Gina Bachauer International Piano Competition but he was not among the six finalists. On July 22, 2010, Albright made his San Francisco Symphony debut with the Duke Ellington \\"New World A-Comin'\\" with conductor Alondra de la Parra.

(John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts). He also gave master classes throughout the country. After Albright's debut at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on February 14, 2011, The Washington Post wrote that \\"Albright is among the most gifted musicians of his generation.\\" It continued that \\"An impressive range of differently colored sounds at the keyboard was matched by overwhelming virtuosity\\" and that Albright \\"leapt the most outrageous technical hurdles... with a sense of dangerous self-abandon that was thrilling to hear. At the same time, musical shape was never sacrificed to showmanship.\\" Albright was named the Harvard University Leverett House Artist in Residence for 2011-2012. Previous Artists in Residence at Leverett have included the likes of cellist Yo-Yo Ma (1979‚Äì1981).

Foote Award of the Harvard Musical Association in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall in February 2013 Albright was invited to give three All-Schubert solo concerts at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in 2013, to which the Boston Musical Intelligencer wrote that the pianist was \\"unsurpassed\\" and \\"on the top tier.\\" The author continued by writing that \\"It was gripping, frankly, both spellbinding and spellbound, quite unlike most such solo recitals I've heard over the decades.\\" The second of the three Schubert-cycle concerts at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum was met with praise, with reviews hailing that \\"Albright is a born Schubert player. Albright has the requisite chops of a competition winner, but the beauty, sensitivity, and taste of a mature artist. His Schubert was ravishing, imaginative, poetic‚Äîfull of poignancy and lyricism. His interpretation sounded spontaneous, but this was also heartfelt, mature playing. Everything had been thought out by a mind brimming with musical intelligence.\\" Actor Courtney Vance and Albright at Harvard University in September 2013 2014 On March 18, 2014, Albright was awarded the 2014 Avery Fisher Career Grant at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. The award is \\"designed to give professional assistance and recognition to talented instrumentalists...who the Recommendation Board and Executive Committee of the Avery Fisher Artist Program believe to have great potential for major careers,\\" and included a $25,000 grant. The Executive Committee consists of such artists as pianist Emanuel Ax and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. 2011-2019 Concert Seasons Albright's 2011-2012 concert season included about 30 concerts and residencies throughout the United States. Highlights included a concert with cellist Yo-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Project commemorating the 10-year remembrance of the 9/11 attacks (September, 2011); guest artist appearances with such orchestras as the Phoenix Symphony (November, 2011) and the Lansing Symphony Orchestra in the 2012 Gilmore Keyboard Festival (May, 2012); masterclasses at universities; and solo concerts. Albright's 2012-2013 concert season included about 38 concerts and residencies, including a fifth concert with cellist Yo-Yo Ma in a roundtable discussion with dancer Damian Woetzel by the Aspen Institute Arts Program; guest artist appearances with the San Francisco Symphony (CA, 2nd time), Fort Smith Symphony (AK), Whatcom Symphony (WA), Great Falls Symphony (MT), Lafayette Symphony (IN), Fargo-Moorhead Symphony (ND), Olympia Symphony (WA), and Hilton Head Symphony (SC); and solo concerts at the Phillips Collection, Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, and the Mondavi Center at UC Davis.

Highlights of the season include a 14-concert tour with conductor Keith Lockhart and the BBC Concert Orchestra, solo debuts at the Music Academy of the West, as well as debuts with vocalist/conductor Bobby McFerrin, the Kalamazoo Symphony Orchestra, the Tacoma Symphony, and the Victoria Symphony. Albright also made his debut in Finland with the Kymi Sinfonietta and conductor Alpesh Chauhan to critical acclaim. Tacoma Symphony was moved from the Rialto Theater to the larger Pantages Theater due to high demand for tickets. Albright's 2015 BBC Concert Orchestra recording of the Shostakovich Piano Concerto No. 2 with Keith Lockhart was chosen as among the \\"BBC Performing Groups Best of 2015.\\" The tour was met with rave reviews, claiming that \\"the orchestra and Albright proceeded to demonstrate how much they deserve all their honors and awards\\" and that \\"The BBC and Albright (were) the best of the year.\\" Albright made his solo debut at Avery Fisher Hall in the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts' Mostly Mozart Festival on August 11 and 12 of 2015. He also debuted as the guest artist with the Houston Symphony, Des Moines Symphony, Alabama Symphony, and California Symphony; and again with the Seattle Symphony. He performed solo concerts in such venues as Detroit's Orchestra Hall, and also returned to begin a cycle of three theme-and- variations themed concerts at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. In April 2016, Albright made his Chinese debut at the National Centre for the Performing Arts with the NCPA Orchestra in Beijing, performing the Starry Sky Concerto written by Xiaogang Ye, which premiered at the 2008 Beijing Olympics' Opening Ceremony. Albright's 2016-2017 season included debuts and engagements with the Baltimore Symphony, the Colorado Springs Symphony, and the Mobile Symphony. Solo recitals include performances at the Portland Piano International Summer Festival, the Rockefeller University, the Society of Four Arts, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum for the conclusion of a Themes and Variations cycle (Albright's second 3-concert cycle and 7th appearance at the venue), and a benefit concert at the Centralia College, which raised nearly $15,000 for the Charlie Albright Scholarship and Charlie Albright Piano. In May 2017, Albright was asked last minute to perform at the Bergen International Festival at Grieg Hall in Bergen, Norway after a cancellation by pianist Lang Lang. The reception was overwhelmingly positive with Albright giving five encores. Albright's 2018/2019 Concert Season includes his Isaac Stern Auditorium main stage Carnegie Hall debut with the American Symphony Orchestra and Maestro Leon Botstein on January 25, 2018, performing the New York City debut of the Vivian Fine Concertante for Piano and Orchestra. The New York Classical Review praised his \\"tender phrasing,\\" \\"Brahmsian sonorities,\\" and improvised cadenza that \\"branched into \\"Lisztian extravagance.\\" \\"The cherry on the sundae was the pianist's 60-second encore, hammering out a chorus of ‚ÄúGreat Balls of Fire‚Äù in the rockin‚Äôest Jerry Lee Lewis style. Talk about ‚Äô50s American music!\\"  Present Concert Season  In May 2019, Albright returned to the Bergen International Festival where he gave both a solo concert at the historic Hakonshallen with five encores, and also had the honor of performing the Grieg Piano Concerto in A minor with conductor Berit Cardas and the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra at Grieg Hall, a yearly tradition of the festival. The Bergensavisen newspaper's raving review of Albright published that \\"Albright can imagine complex musical structures and share them with the audience. Everything is woven together by crazy technical electricity and rare musical understanding. During a flash he can imagine complex musical structures - and share them with us.\\" Discography Vivace is Albright's commercial debut album, released in February 2011. The album holds six works, concluding with a piece composed by Albright. The others are by Haydn, Menotti, Schumann-Liszt, Jan√°ƒçek and Chopin. All of the works were recorded on the Albright Steinway in Corbet Theatre at Centralia College. The Schubert Series - Live - Pt. 1 was commercially released in April 2017 as the first installment of a three-part series all-Schubert albums, recorded live in concert. Part 1 features Schubert's Opus 90 Impromptus and the Sonata in B-flat major, D 960, along with a live improvisation performed as an encore. This concert was described by the Boston Musical Intelligencer as ‚Äúgripping, frankly, both spellbinding and spellbound, quite unlike most such solo recitals I‚Äôve heard over the decades.‚Äù The Schubert Series - Live - Pt. 2 was released commercially in 2020. It includes Schubert's Six Moments Musicaux and Sonata in A Major, D. 959, along with a live improvisation performed as an encore. In a review of this concert, the Boston Musical Intelligencer raved that ‚ÄúHis Schubert was ravishing, imaginative, poetic‚Äîfull of poignancy and lyricism. It would seem Albright is a born Schubert player, whose taste is simply impeccable. His interpretation sounded spontaneous, but this was also heartfelt, mature playing. Everything had been thought out by a mind brimming with musical intelligence. Albright is a master of improvisation, and treated the audience to a fanciful three-minute riff on a short Schubertian-sounding theme. I have heard him do this musical stunt before‚Äîthere are also examples on YouTube. Each time Albright‚Äôs musical imagination and spontaneity amaze.‚Äù  Philanthropy, The Charlie Albright Scholarship, and The Charlie Albright Piano   Named Scholarship and Signature Piano  During September 2009, seven students at the Centralia College received the \\"Charlie Albright Scholarship,\\" organized by the Centralia College Foundation from funds raised by a concert Albright gave in 2008. In December 2009, Centralia College purchased an instrument they called the \\"Charlie Albright Piano\\" as a result of the \\"Charlie Albright Piano Project.\\" Albright gave the inaugural performance on the nine-foot Model D Steinway, purchased for Corbet Theatre, on March 27, 2010. On February 7, 2015, Albright raised over $14,000 at a fundraising benefit concert at the Centralia College for the benefit of the \\"Charlie Albright Scholarship\\" and maintenance of the \\"Charlie Albright Piano.\\" Albright regularly performs benefit concerts to maintain the named scholarship and piano at the college.  Philanthropy  Albright's philanthropic endeavors include performances raising money at Harvard for Haiti after the major earthquake in 2010. In 2019, Albright volunteered the guest artist for the sold-out Symphony Tacoma Gala event at the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, WA. The event was raised over $185,000 for the non-profit organization. Albright Sponsorship Albright has been sponsored by individuals and organizations, including Elizabeth and James Watson; he lives in their Manhattan apartment. Albright was also sponsored by the Bagby Foundation for the Performing Arts. Reception Albright has received positive reviews in the media. The Washington Post declared that \\"Albright is among the most gifted musicians of his generation.\\" It continued that \\"An impressive range of differently colored sounds at the keyboard was matched by overwhelming virtuosity\\" and that Albright \\"leapt the most outrageous technical hurdles... with a sense of dangerous self-abandon that was thrilling to hear. At the same time, musical shape was never sacrificed to showmanship.\\" With regards to Albright's 2015 tour with Keith Lockhart and the BBC Concert Orchestra, they wrote that Albright \\"made quite an impression. He is full of ideas...and has a dazzling natural keyboard affinity. He does not have an overpowering sonority (fingers more velvet than steel) but a lot of nuance.\\" After an April 24, 2015 concert, the DC Metro Theater Arts wrote that \\"Albright was brought back to perform an encore: the audience picked four musical notes and he improvised a piece using those four notes as a base. To hear the initial sequence of four notes and then what an elaborate, beautiful piece Albright turned those simple notes into was thrilling. To listen to his own improvisation, and the emotion he poured into this simple piece...really showed his skill and passion for the piano and for music.\\" The New York Times praised Albright's \\"Jaw-dropping technique\\" and described his playing as \\"virtuosity with a distinctive musicality throughout\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer published that \\"\\"Such a display still has novelty, though Albright didn‚Äôt need it, so distinctive were his improvisational ideas and overall presence. Though the demure lyricism of ‚ÄúFur Elise‚Äù is something one associates with music boxes, Albright took off from it in what turned into a tour of 19th-century pianism. As clever as he sounds, Albright, in fact, gave the improvisation something I rarely witness in such settings: a highly personal emotional depth, as if he was expressing his inner self rather than simply exercising his powers of invention. This concert brought the art of classical-music improvisation to a new level. Of course, Beethoven‚Äôs Piano Concerto No. 3 was bound to show a more filtered version of Albright ‚Äî it‚Äôs a tightly written concerto ‚Äî though his personality was evident in his way of shaping a phrase with a kind of extravagance that had showmanship but never felt cheap. With a fresh, clean, crystalline sound, he played with a kind of ease and smoothness that refuses to airbrush the music, but animates it from within. You simply hear more Beethoven than usual and with a kind of rhythmic momentum that makes you listen more closely, no matter how familiar the music has become. And yes, he improvised the first-movement cadenza as Beethoven himself might have.‚Äù The Boston Musical Intelligencer wrote that if Albright \\"is not indisputably first among equals, he seems to me unsurpassed, anyway, and on the top tier. I will be surprised to hear another performance at this level very soon. It was gripping, frankly, both spellbinding and spellbound, quite unlike most such solo recitals I've heard over the decades.\\" On a separate occasion, they wrote that \\"Albright has the requisite chops of a competition winner, but the beauty, sensitivity, and taste of a mature artist. is Schubert was ravishing, imaginative, poetic‚Äîfull of poignancy and lyricism. It would seem Albright is a born Schubert player, whose taste is simply impeccable. His interpretation sounded spontaneous, but this was also heartfelt, mature playing. Everything had been thought out by a mind brimming with musical intelligence.\\" In response to his improvised encore, they wrote that \\"Albright is a master of improvisation.\\" The New York Concert Review wrote that \\"Albright is a pianist whose name music-lovers will be hearing more and more. Winner of a slew of awards, most prominently a 2014 Avery Fisher Career Grant, Mr. Albright is now in the company of musicians who have become household names‚Ä¶Ursula Oppens, Richard Stoltzman, Joshua Bell, Hillary Hahn, Yuja Wang, and many others who have made their marks. Mr. Albright will undoubtedly lend his own additional distinction to this already illustrious group. This concert, an evening not to be forgotten. He displayed a joy in his playing that was utterly infectious. Beethoven, for one, felt new, because as casual as Mr. Albright was in his stage style and commentary, he was equally intense in his high-powered performances. The finale‚Ä¶took on a fire of the master‚Äôs Op. 57 or 111. It was brilliant, precise, and powerful. In fact, throughout the entire evening, he displayed a joy in playing that was utterly infectious. He disarms jaded concertgoers with an openness and humility that for some reason we are not prepared to expect. Albright brings a vibrant spirit and limitless range for performances. He possesses a kind of intellect that doesn‚Äôt stop growing and will no doubt continue to surprise as his career progresses. The Etude No. 11 (‚ÄúWinter Wind‚Äù), was, as they say, ‚Äúas good as it gets‚Äù ‚Äì and so was No. 12 (‚ÄúThe Ocean‚Äù). The improvisation was‚Ä¶spectacular, and the spontaneity, even with stylistic similarity to Chopin and Rachmaninoff, kept one on the edge of one‚Äôs seat. The improvisation alone was worth the trip. Bravo ‚Äì and encore!\\" On June 13, 2014, Albright gave a debut solo recital in the Rockport Music Festival, where the Boston Musical Intelligencer declared that the \\"piano sensation gave an impassioned and masterful performance.\\" It continued that \\"Albright, who possesses titanic technical skill and much emotional sensitivity, parted the gloomy skies with a sparkling stage-side manner, a welcoming sense of informality, and the artistic willingness and musical chops to include improvisation on the program, a still-rare skill that is being resuscitated by our best artists.\\" Regarding Chopin's Op. 25 etudes, the review stated that \\"Albright launched into the 12-piece set, forming it with the coherency of a piano symphony.\\" Albright's European orchestral debut in Finland with the Kymi Sinfonietta was met with critical acclaim. The Kymen Sanomat wrote that \\"Charlie Albright captured its sound world and structures with unfailing mastery. His total immersion in the composer‚Äôs innermost being continued in the dreamy, bubbling Andante, from which burst the majestic Grande Polonaise for piano and orchestra. It is a most brilliant work of its kind. In the hands of this soloist, the texture, bathed in full splendour, flowed along with an effortless virtuosity enlivened by a primitive rhythmic drive and a refined piano tone. The arrangement of W.A. Mozart‚Äôs Rondo alla Turca heard as an encore soared like a magnificent firework in which virtuosity knew no bounds.\\" After Albright's May 15, 2015 concert with the West Michigan Symphony Orchestra, mLive.com wrote that \\"The ultimate goal is to enjoy music with pure delight and unbridled passion. The virtuoso talent of (Albright)...offered a glimpse of how that can be achieved.\\" Albright's 2015 USA tour with Conductor Keith Lockhart and the BBC Concert Orchestra was chosen as one of the \\"BBC Performing Groups Best of 2015.\\" On October 3, 2016, Albright concluded a second three-concert cycle at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, where he was raved as the \\"Undisputed Master of Variations.\\" It was published that \\"Many pianists possess great technique; many retain a broad repertoire. Charlie Albright has something extra: the propensity to make concerts riveting, fun and exhilarating. His unique way of communing with the music merges his intentions with the composer‚Äôs, bringing freshness of vision and unique expressive ability to his performances.\\" In his performance of Handel, ‚ÄúAlbright played it as a fellow musician-composer, in intimate communion with the essentials of the music.‚Äù With regards to Albright's Kapustin, \\"Two right hands are just what Albright has, and in his hands the jazziness was not only emphasized, but was perfectly executed in the best rendition of this work that you are likely to hear. At times he seemed to be channeling Art Tatum, the difficult rhythms seeming effortless and natural, the variations the essence of jazz.\\" In the improvised encore of themes-and-variations based on notes from the audience \\"Each new variation disclosed a distinctive quality, ranging from urgent to lyrical, solemn to adventurous, shifting from waltz to march to ballade and more‚Äîall while maintaining the overall coherence of the idiom. A vast momentum gathered before coming to a convincing cadence.‚Äù The Omaha World-Herald raved about Albright's two sets of appearances with the Omaha Symphony Orchestra in 2016 and 2019. Albright's Chopin Andante Spianato and Grande Polonaise Brillante was described as \\"inspired.\\" \\"His acrobatics on the keyboard earned another swift standing ovation. Then his frenzied encore of ‚ÄúGreat Balls of Fire‚Äù by Jerry Lee Lewis summoned the crowd to their feet a third time.\\" They wrote that he is \\"widely and rightly hailed as a virtuoso to be watched\\" who performed the Ravel Concerto in G Major with \\"dynamism,\\" \\"gorgeous technique,\\" \\"impeccable phrasing,\\" \\"and just the right amount of inspired improvisation.\\" \\"His commanding performance was the kind that leaves audiences speechless.\\" References External links * Charlie Albright's Blog *Charlie Albright's Official Website Category:American classical pianists Category:Male classical pianists Category:American male pianists Category:Living people Category:New England Conservatory alumni Category:People from Centralia, Washington Category:Harvard College alumni Category:Juilliard School people Category:Juilliard School alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:21st-century classical pianists Category:21st-century American male musicians Category:21st-century American pianists ","title":"Charlie Albright"},{"id":"26061457","text":"Arthur William Blaxall (15 May 1891 ‚Äì 5 December 1970) was a British South African Anglican priest who for most of his life lived and worked in South Africa especially known for his ministry among the blind and the deaf.

The Exchequer of Ireland was a body in the Kingdom of Ireland tasked with collecting royal revenue. Modelled on the English Exchequer, it was created in 1210 after King John of England applied English law and legal structure to his Lordship of Ireland. The Exchequer was divided into two parts; the Superior Exchequer, which acted as a court of equity and revenue in a way similar to the English Exchequer of Pleas, and the Inferior Exchequer, which directly collected revenue from those who owed The Crown money, principally rents for Crown lands. The Exchequer primarily worked in a way similar to the English legal system, holding a similar jurisdiction (down to the use of the Writ of Quominus to take over cases from the Irish Court of Chancery). Following the Act of Union 1800, which incorporated Ireland into the United Kingdom, the Exchequer was merged with the English Exchequer in 1817 and ceased to function as an independent body, although the Irish Court of Exchequer, like other Irish courts, remained separate from the English equivalent.  History  The Exchequer of Ireland was formed in 1210, when King John applied English law, which included the Exchequer, to Ireland. Like the English Exchequer, the Exchequer of Ireland was divided into two parts; the judicial, or Superior Exchequer, which was a court, and the receipt, or Inferior Exchequer, which was tasked with receiving rents and other revenues for The Crown. The principal purpose of the Exchequer was to act as a treasury, taking in revenues, with the receipt department collecting money and the court acting in cases where this money was not paid, or where there was some dispute over it.Howard (1776) p.2 As with the English Exchequer, the judicial part was a court of both law and equity, and was occasionally known as the Irish Exchequer of Pleas, after the English body.Howard (1776) p.3 The Inferior Exchequer, tasked with collecting revenues, remained part of the Exchequer long after the English Inferior Exchequer had become a distinct body called the Treasury.Howard (1776) p.7 The Exchequer was finally dissolved in 1817, when it was amalgamated with the Exchequer of Great Britain following the Act of Union 1800.H. (1932) p.159 The \\"Red Book of the Irish Exchequer\\" (so called by analogy with the English Red Book of the Exchequer) was a 14th-century compilation of Exchequer practice, including the text of the Magna Carta Hiberniae, destroyed in the 1922 Four Courts explosion.  Procedure  Court hearings were held before the Barons of the Exchequer of Ireland, along with the Chancellor and Treasurer; in practice, only the Barons attended. The Court's jurisdiction was over matters pertaining to The Crown's revenues, although the Writ of Quominus was used as a work of legal fiction to widen its remit. The procedure used was similar to that in the Court of Chancery, and as such the officials of the court could only be sued through the Exchequer, not through any other body, particularly if the case was about their professional actions.Howard (1776) p.5 As a result of the Writ of Quominus, anyone identified as a debtor to The Crown could bring a case. Every Irish case which involved the King and his revenue was brought to the Irish Exchequer of Pleas; if brought to another court, it would be relocated to the Exchequer.Howard (1776) p.4 All cases were recorded, first in the Plea rolls and then in the Pipe Rolls, which recorded the revenues and debts owed to The Crown.Howard (1776) p.6 Officials Superior Exchequer The Superior Exchequer, occasionally known as the Irish Exchequer of Pleas, had a variety of officers. At its head was the Lord High Treasurer, the third-highest Officer of the Crown in Ireland. The Lord High Treasurer was able to hear any case in the Exchequer of Pleas, and was also tasked with maintaining and increasing The Crown's revenue in Ireland.Howard (1776) p.9 The Collection of Revenue Act 1795 transferred his powers to the Lord High Treasurer of the United Kingdom; with the unification of Ireland and Great Britain, an additional Treasurer was no longer needed.Thomas (1848) p.150 The next most important figure was the Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland, who acted as a check on the Treasurer and sat during court hearings. In court, he was assisted by the three Barons of the Exchequer of Ireland; the Lord Chief, second and third Barons.Howard (1776) p.10 The Lord Chief Baron was the most senior judge, sitting in all cases and hearing all nisi prius actions alone.Howard (1776) p.11 Outside of the judiciary, the Auditor-General was tasked with entering all grants of land and records of rent, as a result being an officer of both the Superior and Inferior departments of the Exchequer. In this he was assisted by the Surveyor-General, who kept records of all Crown lands, and the Remembrancers, who took the oaths of people pursuing a case.Howard (1776) p.13 The Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland) 1877 merged the Four Superior Courts into one High Court of Justice in Ireland, with the Court of Exchequer become its Exchequer Division. This division was abolished in 1897, although the last Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer retained his title until retiring from the High Court of Justice in 1916. Inferior Exchequer The officers of the Inferior Exchequer included the Lord High Treasurer, who in practice rarely acted, and his deputy the Vice-Treasurer, who as a result did most of the work.

Early life  Of noble birth, he was a cousin of Aleksandr Ivanovich Herzen (1812‚Äì1870), the writer and outstanding public figure; husband to Anna Antonovna and father to Rafail Sergeevich Levitsky (1847‚Äì1940), a Peredvizhniki artist who was court photographer to the ill fated family of Czar Nicholas II, the last emperor of Russia. Sergei was born Lvov-Lvitsky in Moscow but later changed his name to Levitsky. At his parents request he attended and graduated (1839) from the Faculty of Law, Lomonosov Moscow State University and soon after served in the Russian civil service with the Ministry of the Interior, St. Petersburg. His ability to speak several languages allowed him to participate in a government commission to study the composition and therapeutic properties of mineral waters in the Caucasus. On his mission there in 1843, accompanied by the chemist and botanist Carl Julius Fritzsche, an associate of the chemistry department at the Emperor's Academy of Sciences. Levitsky made several daguerreotype views using his camera and the French-made Chevalier lens, which Fritzsche had brought with him from Paris. Daguerreotype, the first form of photography, was invented by Louis Daguerre in 1839. One problem was that it required exposure times as long as thirty minutes to create a portrait. Levitsky's use of the 1840 Charles Chevalier-designed lens, known as the \\"Photographe √† Verres Combin√©s\\" as it combined two cemented achromats; reduced the time needed to capture an image as it improved the camera's focusing ability. The lens brought speeds down to about f/5.6 for portrait work, and, as a bonus, the lens could be converted for use as a landscape lens. Paris studio In 1845, Levitsky travelled to Rome and Venice in Italy before undertaking a course in physics and chemistry at the Sorbonne in Paris but is not listed as working as a professional photographer. He had returned to Russia by 1849 when he opened a studio in St Petersburg. It is in Paris in the 1840s that Sergei Levitsky would study photography, meet with Daguerre personally and distinguish himself in the technical sphere of photographic development. Daguerre who had heard about the talented Russian photographer met with Levitsky cordially and with great interest. In 1847, Sergei designed a bellows camera which significantly improved the process of focusing. This adaptation influenced the design of cameras for decades and is still found in use today in some professional cameras. While in Paris, he would become the first to introduce interchangeable decorative backgrounds in his photos, as well as the retouching of negatives to reduce or eliminate technical deficiencies. Levitsky was also the first photographer to portray a photo of a person in different poses and even in different clothes (for example, the subject plays the piano and listens to himself). In 1849, the images of the Caucasus, Pyatigorsk (large Daguerreotype landscape views made on plates 30x40cm and 24x30cm in size) captured by Levitsky, were exhibited by the famous Parisian optician Charles Chevalier at the Paris Exposition of the Second Republic, also known as the Exposition Nationale des produits de l‚Äôindustrie agricole et manufacturi√®re, as an advertisement of their lenses. These photos would receive the Exposition's gold medal; the first time a prize of its kind had ever been awarded to a photograph. Between 1859 and 1864 Sergei Levitsky operated a photographic studio at 22, rue de Choiseul in Paris formerly the address for American daguerreotypist Warren Thompson [aka Warren- Thompson] and joined the Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Photographie (SPF). Levitsky and Warren-Thompson were associated 1847-49 both making large format daguerreotypes. Thompson opened a studio at 22 rue Choiseul in 1853.Buerger, Janet, French daguerreotypes, University of Chicago Press, 1980, pp. 108-10, and ns.34-35,p18585 Following his father's lead, Rafail Levitsky worked alongside his father in Paris placing his Russian monogram ; on the carte de visite (CDV) photo cards when his hand was involved in the process of taking the photograph. In 1864 when his father closed the Levitsky studio in Paris, Rafail returned to Russia with his father. Levitsky sold his studio to Augustin Aim√© Joseph Le Jeune whose cards carried the Levitsky name and the information that he was the new owner/successor i.e. 'Lejeune succr' until at least 1867. Lejeune reused negatives made by Levitsky as well as making his own images. Lejeune also operated a studio at 106 Rue de Rivoli associated there with a relative Denis Victor Adolphe Le Jeune from 1867. Confusion as to the operation of Levitsky's studio in Paris has arisen from the reference to 'Levitsky', 'M. Levitsky' and 'Maison Levitsky' on Lejeune's cartes de visites and cabinet cards with his ownership and authorship printed usually on the lower right hand side, as 'Le Jeune Succ^r'. By 1872 Le Jeune was operating at 350 Rue St Honore and in turn after the Le Jeunes sold the Rue de Rivoli studio to Auguste La Planquais in 1873 and the following year the Rue St Honore studio to L√©on Abraham Marius Joliot. Le Jeune was listed as a member of the SPF until 1885 as was Levitsky but the latter is most likely a confusion with the exit date of Lejeune. In 1864 Levitsky wrote about his Paris career in The Russian Magazine \\"Photograph\\" (1864, ‚Ññ 3-4) in which he described his great success and artistic triumph which \\"brought to his Paris studio daily orders of some 1500 requests; many of which could not be filled\\". Showing in practice that the skillful combination of both natural and artificial light allowed one to create interesting effects, Levitsky's photographs became recognized throughout Europe for their mastery. Art imitating life Alexander Herzen, by Sergei Lvovich Levitsky,1860 (Private Collection of Alexei Loginov) The Last Supper, by Nikolai Ge,1863 During this time Levitsky was thought to be the first photographer to create true psychological photo-portraits. It is in Paris, that Levitsky would make a series of portraits of his cousin Alexander Herzen; most notable was his portrait of Herzen leaning in a chair which did not simply capture Herzen in his natural state and attitude but conveyed the essence of him as a thoughtful writer, full of mental fatigue, bitterness and disappointment. Creating images that captured the sentiment of each sitter was in keeping with beliefs found in Russian art of the mid nineteenth century, such as literature, music and theatre where artists believed it was possible to penetrate into the soul of a person. This image of Herzen was so strong that Peredvizhniki artist Nikolai Ge would use the repose of Herzen for his Christ figure in his painting The Last Supper (1863). The artist Ge would recall, \\"I wanted to go to London to paint Herzen's portrait,... and he responded to my request with a large portrait by Mr. Levitsky\\". The final painting's similarity between the Levitsky photo of Herzen and Christ led the press of the day to exclaim the painting as \\"a triumph of materialism and nihilism\\". It is the first time photography became the main starting point for the solution to a central character of a painting and speaks to the deep influences that photography would have later on in art and movements like French Impressionism. In 1851, at an exhibition in Paris, Levitsky would win the first ever gold medal awarded for a portrait photograph. In Paris, the Levitsky studio took photos of legendary personalities that included U.S. President Millard Fillmore (1800‚Äì1874) and European Royalty. The studio was the first foreign studio to be given the title of court photographer to Emperor Napoleon III of France. St. Petersburg studio Czar Nicholas II, Empress Alexandra, and daughter Olga. by Sergei Lvovich Levitsky.(1896) One of the first major photographic studios in Russia was owned and operated by Sergei Levitsky, who on his return from Paris in autumn 1849, opened a daguerreotype photo studio called \\"Light painting\\" in St. Petersburg on October 22, 1849. It is Sergei Levitsky who first proposed the idea to artificially light subjects in a studio setting using electric lighting along with daylight saying of its use, \\"as far as I know this application of electric light has never been tried; it is something new, which will be accepted by photographers because of its simplicity and practicality\\". On a trip to Rome, Sergei photographed a group of prominent Russian painters and writers including Nikolai Gogol, displaying his learned technical advancements. Levitsky's portrait of Gogol is now believed to be the only known portrait of this great personality. These photos were major successes for Levitsky and word spread quickly about a studio that had its employees traveling to the homes of customers with their daguerreotype apparatus. Considered the best of Russia's portrait photographers, the Levitsky studio photographed four generations of the Romanov dynasty. In 1877, it was awarded the title Photographer of their Royal Majesty. Levitsky is perhaps best known for a series of photographs of famous artists, writers and public figures (included among these notable figures were Nikolai Nekrasov, Ivan Turgenev, Ivan Goncharov, Vladimir Sollogub, Fedor Tyutchev, Peter Vyazemsky, Alexander Strugovshchikov, Vasily Botkin, Ivan Panaev, Pavel Annenkov, Dmitry Grigorovich, Alexander Herzen, Sergey Volkonsky, and Leo Tolstoy). By the 1890s, the Levitsky St. Petersburg studio was a father son enterprise, with Rafail Levitsky working alongside his father. Photo cards of this time have the distinctive Levitsky name 'and Son' both written as a signature and printed on their backs. In May 1878, Sergei Levitsky was one of the founders of Russia's first Photographic Societies, part of the Imperial Russian Technical Society; which saw him work alongside Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev and other scientists experimenting with photography using artificial light. Sergei Levitsky was also a writer of articles for the Russian magazine \\"Photograph\\" and was actively involved in organizing national and international photographic exhibitions throughout his lifetime. Czarina Alexandra with Olga and Maria. by Rafail Sergeevich Levitsky .(1899) The Di Rocco Wieler Private Collection, Toronto, Canada He wrote memoirs in two volumes entitled, Reminiscences of an Old Photographer (1892) and How I Became a Photographer (1896). He is buried in St. Petersburg's Smolenskoye Cemetery. Upon his father‚Äôs death in 1898, Rafail Levitsky continued the operation and tradition of the Levitsky portrait studio taking the now famous photos of Czar Nicholas II and Czarina Alexandra and their children Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia, Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia, Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, and Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia. So popular were the photos of the Romanovs that they were reproduced individually for public consumption in an 'Edition A Bon Marche' by Rafail. While running the St. Petersburg studio, Rafail began the tradition of taking photos of everyday Russian actors and everyday Russian people while continuing the Studio's resume of taking photos that included Russia's who's who including such luminaries as Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia, Russian General Aleksei Nikolaievitch Kouropatkine and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The Levitsky Studio was located in Moika River Embankment, 30 (1860s), Nevsky Prospect, 28 (1890s), and Kazanskaya Street, 3 (1898, the house is not preserved). The Levitsky St. Petersburg Studio remained in operation until it was closed by the Soviets in 1918. Legacy The magnitude of Sergei and Rafail Levitsky‚Äôs catalogue raisonn√© remains unknown. Their influence on photographers, artists, their history, and their life‚Äôs artistic achievements were erased during the Soviet era; an era where aristocratic origins and ties to the Romanov family were cause for violent repression. During the Soviet era the official government point of view on the development of photography in Russia in the pre-revolutionary period was: \\"In our country, before the Great October Socialist Revolution there was no photographic industry. Photographic products were found in only a few semi-artisan factories. Although our compatriots were associated with many of the crucial inventions in photography. .., the ruling circles of autocracy hampered the development of domestic photography as cameras, plates, and photographic paper were mainly imported from abroad\\". In 1978, the decision to set up a photographic section within the Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris, France marked the first recognition and inclusion of works by Sergei Lvovich Levitsky. The National Portrait Gallery, London, England followed soon after. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York also has a few examples of his work. In 1992, the vaults of the Russian State Documentary Film and Photo Archive at Krasnogorsk (RGAKFD) were opened to reveal photographic documentation of events from over a century ago to the present in Russia. Many early photos are arranged in large albums according to subject. Among these are 300 personal albums of the Tsars. Although mostly documentary in nature, the Archive does hold work by many famous Russian still photographers which includes those of Sergei Lvovich Levitsky and Rafail Sergeevich Levitsky. Today, the largest collection of paintings by Rafail Sergeevich Levitsky are found in The Di Rocco Wieler Private Collection (DRWC), Toronto, Canada. The collection, which is dedicated to preserving the memory, legacy and works of both Rafail Sergeevitch Levitsky and Sergei Lvovich Levitsky; has many important early photos by Sergei Lvovich Levitsky.

He played his entire professional football career for English club Watford, and made an appearance for his country during a wartime international match against England.  Playing career  Born in Troed-y-rhiw, Glamorgan, Davies played local football at amateur Welsh club New Tredegar, before joining Watford as an amateur in April 1930. He turned professional three months later, and stayed at Vicarage Road for the entirety of his 21-season (20 year) professional career. During that time Davies played 283 Football League games, 128 wartime matches and 29 FA Cup fixtures. He also played 13 games in the Football League Third Division South Cup, which Watford won in 1937. He played for the Wales national football team at Ninian Park on 6 May 1944, where they were defeated 2‚Äì0 by England. However, wartime internationals are not recognised by FIFA or the Football Association of Wales as official internationals, and therefore Davies did not receive a cap. Davies was a forceful and skilful winger who not only centred the ball well but was also an excellent schemer. One match report commented: \\"He puts plenty of life and thought into his game ‚Ä¶ (but has) a tendency to hold his ground and pass back instead of taking a direct route to goal.\\" A cartilage operation in the 1937‚Äì38 season put him out of action until April 1938 and the club never recovered from his loss, missing out on promotion. Davies continued playing for Watford after the Second World War, and was the club's top scorer in the 1947‚Äì48 season, with 11 goals in all competitions.  Later career  Davies retired at the end of the 1949‚Äì50 season, just before his 40th birthday. He then became the licensee of the Red Lion pub, which is situated opposite the entrance to Vicarage Road stadium. He died in Watford, Hertfordshire at the age of 85.

It has rough, fibrous bark on the base of its trunk and smooth, white bark above. The leaves are lance-shaped and groups of seven spindle- shaped flower buds are arranged in leaf axils or on the ends of the branches. White flowers are mostly present between August and February and the fruit are barrel-shaped to urn-shaped. Description Eucalyptus albens is a tree that grows to a height of high with a straight trunk for about half its total height and a branched, spreading crown. Its trunk may reach diameter at breast height and has rough, fibrous, pale grey, sometimes tessellated bark to the base of its larger branches. The bark higher up is smooth and white and is shed annually in short ribbons. The leaves on young plants are arranged alternately, egg-shaped to almost round, bluish grey, long, wide and have a petiole. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, dull greyish green and paler on one side, long and wide with a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on a branching inflorescence, each branch with groups of seven buds. The peduncle is flattened or angular and long, each flower on a cylindrical pedicel up to long. The buds are spindle-shaped to more or less cylindrical, long and wide with the operculum cone-shaped and about as long as the floral cup. The flowers are white and appear in the autumn from March to May. The fruit are urn-shaped to barrel-shaped, long and wide.E. albens flowers and budsE. albens fruit Taxonomy Eucalyptus albens was first formally described in 1867 George Bentham from material collected in several locations, including by botanist and explorer, Allan Cunningham, along the \\"Macquarrie river\\". It is related to grey box (E. moluccana) and inland grey box (E. microcarpa). Hybridization with grey box has been reported in the Hunter Valley. The specific epithet (albens) is a Latin word meaning \\"whitening\\". Both the epithet and common names are derived from the white deposits over the leaves and gumnuts, while the epithet \\"box\\" comes from the box-like tesselated pattern in the bark. Distribution and habitat The white box is a tree of grassy eucalypt woodlands on plains or gently sloping areas from south-east Queensland to the western slopes of New South Wales and north-eastern Victoria extending as far south as Yea. Isolated populations occur in the Flinders Ranges and near Melrose South Australia. It is associated with inland grey box, fuzzy box (E. conica), yellow box (E. melliodora), Pilliga grey box (E. pilligaensis), red ironbark (E. sideroxylon), narrow-leaved ironbark (E. crebra), Blakely's red gum (E. blakelyi), apple species (Angophora), black cypress (Callitris endlicheri), white cypress (Callitris glaucophylla), kurrajong (Brachychiton populneus) and wattles (Acacia) species. Conservation Eucalyptus albens is a component of the \\"WhiteBox Yellow Box Blakelys' Red Gum Woodland\\" commonly referred to as \\"Box-Gum Woodland\\" that is classed as \\"critically endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as an \\"endangered ecological community\\" under the New South Wales Government Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. Uses The heavy and hard wood is used for railway sleepers and fence posts. The flowers produce nectar for the honey industry.

Piula Theological College is a Methodist training institution in Samoa. It was established in 1868 in Lufilufi on the north coast of Upolu island after its initial beginnings in 1859 at Satupa'itea on the south coast of Savai'i island. The Methodist Mission in Samoa purchased the land at the Methodist leaning district and later named their training center Piula Theological College. The name Piula is a transliteration of the biblical name Beulah which means married (to the Lord). The college includes the recently renovated historic Piula chapel, large open grounds, and Samoan fale. At the front of the chapel are steps leading down to the sea where Fatumea, the oval Piula Cave Pool is, a popular swimming hole for locals and visitors. History In Samoa, the Methodist religion is referred to as 'lotu tonga' through the early initial contact with converts and the church's mission in Tonga during the early 19th century. The decision to set up the training institution came about from an annual church meeting held on Manono Island, a stronghold of the church at the time, on 21 September 1859. A key figure during the early years of the Methodist church in Samoa was the Rev. George Brown who lived in Samoa for 14 years, between 1860 and 1874. He worked with his wife Lydia at the mission in Satupa'itea on Savai'i island. Brown learned the Samoan language and regarded the people as his friends. Like many other missionaries to the Pacific, Brown recorded his experience in Samoa in journals which include significant historical information about the Methodist church and Samoan history and culture. Academics The theological college offers a four-year course leading to a Diploma in Theological Studies with the possibility of going on to secure a Bachelor of Divinity degree. The training prepares people for Ministry in the Samoa Methodist Church. Some of the students are married and the wives undertake courses to prepare them for the role they will play as minister's wives. A guiding principle to all college activity has been the notion that Piula should be, as near as possible, a Christian village. Students are taught how to take part in a proper manner in Samoan custom and society. Location On Upolu island, the college is 26 km east along the northern coastal road from the capital Apia. Entry to the campus is through a blue and yellow painted stone wall beside the main island road. File:Rev George Brown c. 1908.jpg|George Brown (1835-1917), a founder of the college.

The second edition has been released by Asterion Press in 2007 and it goes by the name \\"Sine Requie Anno XIII\\" (\\"Sine Requie the 13th Year\\"). The third edition has been released by Serpentarium in 2016 and it goes by the name \\"Sine Requie Anno XIII, Second Edition\\". Play Overview Game History Sine Requie was the winner of the \\"Best of Show\\" as the best Italian game at the Lucca Comics and Games convention, at its debut in 2003. A second edition, with a rigid and more artistic cover, named \\"Sine Requie Anno XIII\\" was published in 2007 by Asterion Press, winning the \\"Best of Show\\" award as Best Role Playing Game and the \\"GMM Award\\", again as Best Role Playing Game in 2008. The first \\"Anno XIII\\" module, \\"Sanctum Imperium Anno XIII\\" (\\"Holy Empire the 13th Year\\"), won the \\"Side Award\\" at Lucca Comics and Games in 2008 for \\"Best Artistic Layout\\". Game System The most well-known peculiarity of this game is the use of tarots to execute actions, instead of dice rolling like the well-known D&D.; Setting The game is set in an alternative 1957, 13 years after what is remembered as \\"The Judgment Day\\": the 6th of June 1944 (also known, in the real world, as the \\"D-Day\\"), the day in which human history changed forever. While the fiercest war ever was raging, the Second World War, the Dead rose from their graves to devour the living and to wreak havoc on them. Many nations did not have the strength to counteract the violence and crumbled before the insane hunger of those that were once living beings. Only a few survivors lasted in those wastelands, where \\"life\\" had changed her name to \\"nightmare\\". Lost Lands The Lost Lands are by now rotten deserts where thin bunches of men and women, either audacious or on the brink of madness, live from day to day. It is a place where finding water or provisions can costs one's life, and the ground is scratched by the crawling steps of hordes of the Dead and other dreadful creatures. Some nations with strong leaders were able to hold out, establishing totalitarian regimes. Fourth Reich The Third Reich, claiming victory in World War II, took the name of IV Reich (The Fourth Reich). In these territories, ruled by the Nazi regime, life is regulated by rigid and cruel laws, and personal liberty is only a dream. The cities, surrounded by fortified walls, are the same as they were ten years before, and nothing appears to be different. People live unaware of the horror that crawls outside the cities' borders. Gestapo soldiers patrol the streets to maintain public order, instilling an atmosphere of terror and suffering. Ferocious SS Platoons deport more and more citizens to the Reeducation Camps, from where nobody ever returns. In the name of a new religion risen from the ashes of Christianity, churches are desecrated and converted to shrines of the new F√ºhrer-Messiah who will once again lead the Reich to global conquest. Sanctum Imperium In Italy, after the fall of the fascist regime, a rigid theocracy was imposed, ruled by Pope Leone XIV. This new state has returned Italy to the medieval period. Most modern technology has been abolished or is only in the hands of a privileged few. The Italian territories appear to be anachronistic places, where old cars stand beside pyres of a new inquisition. Templars in shining armour fight alongside Hunters of the undead, veterans of the world war, to defend the population. In the Papal State, the fervent religious fanaticism has brought a ferocious fight to heresies and to all that is \\"anti-papal\\". Soviet The Russian civilization survived the horror but at the cost of extreme changes. Giant metal cities, immense mazes of towers and corridors extend from the depth of the earth to the sky, while, from the untiring factories, the first bio-machines were born, the monstrous forefront of a new humanity. This is Soviet, the realm of the sentient machine Z.A.R., an inhuman dictator of a technocracy that had decreed the end of concepts like family, religion, peace and rest. Not even sunlight is granted to the slave citizens of the Calculator, and the days have lost their value and changed their length to submit to the rigid and precise rhythms of the bio-machine factories. The Reign Of Osiris In Egypt the Pharaohs came back from their tombs with unimaginable powers, and now they govern a society based on their old reigns. Ramses III guides the new Egypt with its living and dead servants, while the rebel Pharaohs of Ombos, breeders of humans, plot to undermine the ruler from its throne.

Folklorists of the early 20th century considered it to be a conglomeration of several English broadside ballads, tracing its stanzas to \\"Sheffield Park\\", \\"The Squire's Daughter\\", \\"A Brisk Young Soldier\\", \\"A Brisk Young Sailor\\" and \\"Sweet William (The Sailor Boy)\\". Steve Roud describes it as :\\"One of the most widely-known 'forsaken girl' songs in the American tradition, which is often particularly moving in its stark telling of an age-old story.\\"Roud, Steve (2015). Song notes to My Bonnie Lies Over The ocean: British Songs in the USA, CD boxset NEHI Records NEH3X1 In the song, a butcher‚Äôs apprentice abandons his lover, or is unfaithful toward her. The lover hangs herself and is discovered by her father. She leaves a suicide note, which prescribes that she be buried with a turtle dove placed upon her breast, to show the world she died for love. This narrative use of the turtle dove is derived from Old World symbolism; it is analogous to the folksong interment motif of a rose, briar, or lily growing out of the neighboring graves of deceased lovers. In this respect, \\"Butcher's Boy\\" is related to the ballads \\"Earl Brand\\", \\"Fair Margaret and Sweet William\\", \\"Lord Thomas and Fair Annet\\", \\"Barbara Allen\\", and \\"Lord Lovel\\". Commercial recordings have been made by Kelly Harrell, by Buell Kazee (frequently re-issued, notably in the Anthology of American Folk Music) and by The Blue Sky Boys.  Variations  In some versions of the story, the heroine is impregnated by her lover before being abandoned. In others, he leaves her for a woman who is wealthier than she. The final line of the song often differs between some versions. For example, some lyrics include \\"till cherries grow on an apple tree.\\" The location of the song also varies in certain versions; some set the song in More Street, or London City. Recently, the ballad has been popularly covered by commercially successful artists. Joan Baez followed the text of Buell Kazee, and therefore changed the title to \\"The Railroad Boy\\". Tommy Makem learned the version sung by his mother Sarah Makem and recorded it both on a solo album and with The Clancy Brothers. Kirsty Maccoll also recorded the song, and Sin√©ad O'Connor recorded it for the soundtrack of the film also called The Butcher Boy.. The tune of The Butcher Boy is used for the American song Ballad of the Green Berets by Barry Sadler.

CSAM also holds an annual conference on the State of the Art in Addiction Medicine and workshops on issues ranging from pain and addiction and screening and brief intervention to opioid treatment and trauma and addiction. The Medical Education and Research Foundation for the treatment of alcoholism and other drug dependencies was established in 1981 as a sister organization to the California Society of Addiction Medicine. The Foundation‚Äôs mission is to increase and improve the education of physicians about all aspects of addiction, including harmful drinking or drug use, medical sequellae, family impact and how to support recovery. Its primary activities are mentored learning experiences at annual, three-day conferences on addiction medicine offered by CSAM. Advocacy CSAM members advocate for greater treatment access and improved treatment at the state level among California elected officials and regulators, while partnering with many other medical and nongovernmental organizations. Among the issues that CSAM supports are increasing funding for addiction treatment, raising standards for the substance abuse treatment workforce, improving treatment and prevention for adolescents and young adults and providing better treatment opportunities for health professionals who suffer from the disease of addiction. Resources CSAM offers a wide range of information on addiction medicine to health professionals, including materials from its educational conferences and programs and a quarterly newsletter.

With a global emphasis on water saving, many new buildings and renovations are seeing the installation of water saving fixtures such as low flow shower heads and low flush toilets. With the decrease in wastewater flows problems are arising from waste solids not being carried completely to the main sewers, often causing blockages. History *2006 ‚Äì Ducane R&D; Pty Ltd conceived the idea of a device that can store wastewater and release it in large batches to replace the drain clearing action of large volume toilet flushes. *2010 ‚Äì After much prototyping and development the devices are offered for sale in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom under the name Drainwave. Performance Independent testing has shown that the use of an SDU allows for the use of low flush toilets using as little as 0.8 L to push general waste solids more than 25 metres along a typical wastewater drainpipe. An advantage of the SDU is that it can use more than just the toilet wastewater to keep drains clear of blockages.

Pauline Quirke stars as the eponymous title character, an unorthodox detective whose hands on yet down-to-earth approach is not always appreciated by her superiors. Created by Stephen Bill, a total of twelve episodes were broadcast across two series. The first series features a running story arc involving Maisie's wayward brother Kelvin (Paul Reynolds), and had a much lighter feel than the second, which featured grittier storylines including drug dealing, armed robbery, arson and murder. Throughout the series, Maisie is portrayed as a strong and dedicated detective, often stepping on toes and bending the rules to get results, and even becoming personally involved with the victims of each case. She often clashes with her superior officer, Jack Freeman (Ian McElhinney), who also appears to hold a romantic torch for her, while George Kyprianou (Steve John Shepherd), a junior constable on her team, often proves to be her best ally in the field. Maisie also receives help from her loyal housekeeper Joan (Stella Moray). Although neither series has been released on DVD, repeats of the series are regularly shown on Drama and Alibi.

It is a stone one-room schoolhouse built, demolished and rebuilt in the middle of the 19th century. It was the only structure left standing in the large area condemned by New York City when nearby Pepacton Reservoir was built. Today it serves as a local history museum. In 1998 it and its privy were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Property The school and privy are at the end of a small unpaved road leading north from the highway about 2 miles (3.2 km) south of Margaretville, just north of the reservoir. The area around the school is wooded and otherwise undeveloped. The East Branch of the Delaware River, the waterway impounded to create the reservoir, is a short distance to the northwest. The main building is a small one-story structure, , of fieldstone walls and foundation with a gabled roof covered in asphalt shingles, pierced by a small bell tower at the front and a brick chimney at the rear. Clapboard fills in the gable ends. A single paneled door is centrally located in the south (front) facade; there are three windows on either side and two on the rear. A stone step leads up to the front door, supplemented by a modern wooden wheelchair ramp. At the left, five feet (1.75 m) off the ground is a datestone with \\"1820\\" on it. Inside a small vestibule opens into the main schoolroom, with wooden floors, walls in horizontal wood siding to four feet (1.3 m) and pressed tin above joining a similar ceiling. A box stove is at the rear, and blackboards and desks and other school items, some original, are located within. The privy is northeast of the school. It is a small frame building, 6¬Ω by 10¬Ω feet (2 by 3.2 m) on a stone foundation, sided in clapboard with an asphalt roof. There are two rooms, one for boys and another for girls. History Dunraven had its own school as early as 1765, when a wooden school was built somewhere in the vicinity. It burned sometime between its construction and 1820, when a local couple conveyed the small lot where the school stands now to the school district with the condition that it could only be used for educational or religious purposes by them or any subsequent owner. The townspeople built a school of fieldstone, an unusual material for a schoolhouse in upstate New York but probably understandable in Dunraven due to its local abundance. Its appearance is not known, although it may have been similar to the current building. The original privy, whose exact date of construction is not known, had no separate toilets. By 1857 the school had fallen into disrepair, and was apparently torn down. The stones were saved to be rebuilt with new mortar in 1860. Eighty years later, in 1940, the small local districts were centralized, and the school became the property of the Margaretville Central School District. After World War II, when New York City began the process of acquiring and condemning land for Pepacton Reservoir, it first attempted to overturn the deed restriction in order to demolish the school. It was unsuccessful, and after it abandoned the attempt the district tried to sell the building. Voters rejected the proposal, and the district then transferred the property to the Town of Middletown for use as a historical museum. It also serves some other public purposes.

Ahmet Kemalettin or Kemaleddin (1870-July 13, 1927), widely known as Mimar Kemalettin (Kemalettin the Architect) and Kemalettin Bey, was a renowned Turkish architect of the very late period of the Ottoman architecture and the early years of the newly established Republic. He was among the pioneers of the first national architectural movement. His lifetime saw intense and important changes for Turkish history and culture. Early years Ahmet Kemalettin was born 1870 in a middle-class family to Ali Bey, a naval captain, and his wife Sadberk Hanƒ±m at Acƒ±badem neighborhood of Kadƒ±k√∂y district in Istanbul. In 1875, he began with his primary education at \\"ƒ∞brahim Aƒüa ƒ∞btidai Mektebi\\". He continued his secondary education in 1881 on Crete (then part of the Ottoman Empire) due to his father's assignment. Returned soon after to Istanbul, he finished the high school. In 1887 at the age of 17, he entered the School of Civil Engineering (, today's Istanbul Technical University). Ahmet Kemalettin graduated as an engineer with honours in 1891. He then remained at his alma mater and worked as an assistant for four years. During this time, he created his own works in his office he had opened outside the university. In 1895, promoted by his scholar German architect August Jachmund, designer of the Sirkeci Railway Terminal in Istanbul, and supported by a state scholarship, he went to Germany, where he was educated two years in architecture at the Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg in Berlin. Afterwards, he worked two-and-half years in various architecture offices gaining professional experience. In 1900, Ahmet Kemalettin returned home and resumed work at the university. Following the departure of August Jachmund, he assumed his post as lecturer. In 1908, he played a pioneering role in the formation of the first vocational organization for engineers and architects in the Ottoman Empire, the \\"Society of Ottoman Architects and Engineers\\".  Designing and building  Whilst still a student at the Hendese-i Mulkƒ±ye (State School of Engineering) where he commenced his studies in 1887 he received the Medal for Industry. He must have been hardworking and creative. These personal attributes may have been related to his greater interest in the lessons of Prof. Jasmund on architecture than in engineering and to the fact that Prof. Jasmund chose him as his assistant. Kemalettin shows himself to be a designer open to learning and experimentation and is also a portrayal of a self-reliant architect. However great an influence Jasmund and the German connections are on his perception of design, the wide scope of his references is also important. The Art Nouveau of Ratip Pasha Mansion, a building of the early era, or the connection of Harikzedegan Apartments with French public housing, the Orientalist flavour in the design of the Evkaf-ƒ± Humayun Nezareti (Ministry of Imperial Foundations), the eclectic style of the 3rd Foundation Han or the Empire line of the Husnu Pasha Tomb cannot be ignored. A Kemaleddin work doubtless presents an image overflowing with ideological connections. Only here his creativity also feeds his ideology. The transformation of his ideology into a school of architecture is essentially down to his creative talent and self-confidence, if also fed by his industriousness and organisational expertise or teaching skill/teaching discipline. His life was already over when he ascertained the eventuality of this confidence being shaken. His architecture was a tale that prevented the hero from experiencing a tragic end, from an untimely death. Restorer with principles On 27 Rebi- √ºl ahir 1327/18 May 1909, he was appointed head of architecture at the Imperial Ministry of Foundations. The possibility of designing and bringing to fruition new building projects is an irresistible passion for an architect, but running maintenance and restoration works on historical buildings, the basic and traditional function of the Ministry, was also a very special learning opportunity. Kemalettin took the intelligent approach of evaluating the two fields together and allowing each to foster the other. Restoration was an opportunity for productivity in which he drew on and applied information that was the source for the experimentation that differentiates architectural language. Whilst perceiving restoration as a method of interpreting traditional architecture and making the linguistic infrastructure for its renewal, he attempted to manage and give direction to a field whose principles were as yet not clearly defined. He knew that restoration was not an ordinary repairs job. He taught it. He pioneered in the field by restoring a great number of Ottoman monumental structures employing for the first time a scientific approach. He restored the Yeni Cami Hunkar Gathering Place with passionate enthusiasm. But his principal performance was certainly the Mescid-i Aksa and Harem-i Serif project. The skill he demonstrated in the restoration of the Mescid-i Aksa won him international acclaim and an award from the Royal Institute of British Architects. Teaching and organizing On graduation from the Hendese-i M√ºlkiye he was appointed to the teaching staff of Technology and Architecture at the same school and as Prof. Jasmund's assistant. On his return from Germany where he went to gain knowledge and experience he took up his post at the Hendese-i Mulkiye again. And from that point on he continued to teach. He educated hundreds of students at Sanayi-i Nefise Mekteb-i Alisi (the Academy of Fine Arts), Konduktor Mekteb-i Alisi (the Conductor School) and Muhendis Mekteb-i Alis (the Academy of Engineering). They were the years when the school of civil engineering was founded and developed as part of the Muhendishane-i Berri-i Humayun (the Military School of Engineering). At the stage when the curriculum of the school was being developed Kemalettin Bey was running a large number of different courses. It was an open field ranging from Technology and Architecture to Pen and Ink and Shadow Drawing and from Calligraphy to Iron Works. But what is certain is that he transmitted his enthusiasm to the students. When he was appointed to the Evkaf Nezareti, he took his students to the Building and Reparation Technological Assembly to meet the anticipated demand for intensive and fast production. This permanent staff composed of the talented architects and engineers he had chosen was to turn into a school and its office was to become a production centre, as it were, of the design concept given the name of national architecture. But that was not all. It was Kemalettin Bey who pioneered the founding of the Ottoman Society of Architects and Engineers, and who personally penned the call to the meetings of the Foundation through the Tanin newspaper. His final role was membership, and subsequently the presidency, of the Council of Fine Arts founded by the Ministry of Education in 1926. Thinking and writing The writing of Turkish architecture and the history of architecture is a field that opened up late and has not yet accumulated enough strength. Even today it does not appear to have reached the necessary level. Kemalettin Bey is an unrivalled pioneer on this subject. His thoughts on living and professional models are also incomparable. On the one hand there is his identity as an architect and professional experience in that he designed many buildings, most of which he built; on the other hand there is the duty that is obligatory for the teaching profession of transferring information and experience within specific systematics; a writing function arising from the synergy of this dichotomy and a realisation of the need for questioning, evaluation and historical contextualisation. When research and thought of the genetic codes of a work and profession are perceived as a mission, the first or earliest written account of our history of architecture has begun. Of course the content and the approach can be debated. But not his pioneering. 1870-1891 The availability of information and documentation of the first years of Kemalettin's life is very limited. All that is known is that he started at the Ibrahim Aga primary school near his home in 1875 and that he learned French and Arabic at the special school, to which his father was appointed, opened for children of army officers in Crete in 1881. When he returned to ƒ∞stanbul he continued his education at the Numune-i Terakki school, which provided a model education. He graduated from this school, where the most well known teachers of the era gave lessons such as the mathematician Mehmed Nadir or the astronomer Huseyin Efendi. In 1887, he was accepted into the second class of the Hendese-i Mulkiye. He was awarded the Medal for Industry while he was still a student and graduated in 1891. 1870-1909 Structural engineering and architecture are taught together at the historical Muhendishane (Hendese-i Mulkiye) in Halƒ±cƒ±oƒülu, which Kemalettin starts attending in the second class. Kemalettin shows more interest in Prof. Jasmund's architecture classes than in engineering classes. Nevertheless, his training as an engineer makes itself felt in all his designs. 1909-1919 On 18 May 1909, he was appointed head of architecture at the Imperial Ministry of Foundations (or, the General Directorate of Foundations, as it is now known). The years of this period of office, 1909-1919, were the most productive era for Kemalettin Bey from the perspective of architectural design and applications. As well as running maintenance and repair works on historical structures, the traditional role of the ministry, he also designed and built new construction projects. The restoration works that made it possible to become acquainted with and examine Ottoman architecture directly and in a concrete manner were his field of reference for new building designs. He took the information source of trials that distinguish the language of architecture experimentation from these works and applied it. His restoration works are the least well known and least documented of Kemalettin Bey's works. We can find out about the restoration of the Yeni Cami Hunkar imperial gathering place from written documents, and the restoration of Fatih Mosque and its rest house and Nuruosmaniye Mosque from the drawings in the archive of the General Directorate of Foundations. Career Edirne Karaaƒüa√ß Tren ƒ∞stasyonu (Karaaƒüa√ß Railroad Station in Edirne) designed by Mimar Kemalettin Bey After the proclamation of the Second Constitutional Monarchy in 1908, Ahmet Kemaleddin Bey was appointed director of the Construction and Restoration Department at the Ministry of Foundations (). He designed four railway stations for the Oriental Railway Company. For his successful work at the construction of Plovdiv Central railway station, he was tasked with the design of railway stations of Thessaloniki and Edirne. At the railway station of Thessaloniki, only the foundations were completed. The railway station of Edirne could be completed in 1914. In 1908, he built a girls' high school in Edirne, which went 1910 in education. He was invited by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem to carry out restoration work on the Al-Aqsa Mosque. He accepted the invitation and went to Jerusalem, which had come under British Mandate from Ottoman Empire after World War I. He stayed there a while. For his successful restoration work, Mimar Kemalettin Bey was awarded with honorific membership by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). After returning home, he focused his works on buildings in Ankara, the new capital of the Republic. As one of the pioneers of the First Turkish National Architectural Movement, Mimar Kemalettin Bey was inspired by the Ottoman classical architecture, and tried to create a new style by combining the distinct features of German and Ottoman architecture. He rendered the characteristics of Ottoman and Islamic structures so that they reflect the Turkish national identity. He put arches, copings and tiles on the facade of his buildings in foreground, emphasized symmetry and highlighted conventional style with turrets and cornices. Final years Regrettably Kemalettin Bey's dazzling career crowned by his restoration of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem and the RIBA award he won for it did not have a happy ending. The cool stance developing towards the end of the 1920s on the National Architecture comprising Ottoman forms he represented in Ankara, the city he went to on an official call and where he built important structures, led to his alienation and solitude. However, at that time such alienation was nothing unique either to him or to Turkey. In the 1920s with the emergence of modern architecture that offered a whole new world of shapes countless architects of the generation of Kemalettin Bey, who could not break free from the forms of old, shared the same fate around the same time almost all over the world. He lived in a time segment that was as full of joy and ebullience as it was of traumatic disappointments. And his life ended in a hotel room in Ankara on 12 July 1927. Death Bayezid II Mosque in Istanbul. Ahmet Kemalettin died on July 13, 1927, in Ankara at the building site of Ankara Palas as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage, at the age of 57. He was survived by his wife Sabiha and son ƒ∞lhan Mimaroƒülu, who became a renowned composer. His corpse was transferred to Istanbul, and was laid to rest at the Karacaahmet Cemetery. Some years later, without the knowledge of his family his grave was moved to the graveyard of Bayezid II Mosque, due to the construction of a road between Kadƒ±k√∂y and √úsk√ºdar, which went through the cemetery on the spot of his grave. Reburied at the new site without a headstone, his grave was discovered in the 1990s. In 2007, his burial place was restored. Notable works He designed among others the Tayyare Apartments, built between 1919-1922 in Istanbul, which were redeveloped in 1985 into luxury hotel premises. His another work Istanbul 4th Vakƒ±f Han was converted into a five-star World Park Hotel. Notable works of him include: * Ey√ºp Anadolu High School, Istanbul * √áapa Anadolu Teachers' High School, Istanbul * ≈ûemsi Pasha Primary School * √áamlƒ±ca Girls' High School * Bostancƒ± Mosque, Istanbul * Ye≈üilk√∂y Mosque, Istanbul * Re≈üadiye School (today's Ey√ºp Middle School), Istanbul * Tomb of Sultan Reshad * Tomb of Gazi Osman Pasha * Tomb of Mahmud Shevket Pasha The tomb made for Mahmut ≈ûevket Pasha, one of the last Ottoman grand viziers, and his aide Ibrahim Halƒ±l Bey and his footman Kazƒ±m Efendi is in the Hurriyet-i Ebediye War Cemetery to commemorate those who lost their lives in the events of 31 March 1909. Mahmut Sevket Pasha, known to the people as the freedom Hero for suppressing the uprising in Istanbul as commander of the 3rd Army in the 31 March events, was killed by counter revolutionaries on 14 June 1913. The design of the tomb has a completely new composition distinguishing it from other tombs by Kemalettin Bey. The tomb consists of a canopy like section that is square plan, accessed on three sides by steps, covered with a double walled dome, and open on three sides, and an adjacent semi octagonal plan structure covered with a semidomed exedra. * Tomb of Ali Rƒ±za Pasha * Tomb of H√ºsn√º Pasha * Restoration of Fethiye Mosque and Sinan Pasha Madrasa * Bandƒ±rma Haydar √áavu≈ü Mosque * Tomb of Ahmed Cevad Pasha, Istanbul (1901) * Plovdiv Central Station (1908) * Kamer Hatun Mosque, Beyoƒülu, Istanbul (1911) * Bebek Mosque, Istanbul (1913) * Library of Istanbul University's Faculty of Letters (1913) * Restoration of Edirne Railway Station (1914) * Istanbul 1st Vakƒ±f Han (1918) * Tayyare Apartments, Istanbul (1922) * Projecting of restoration work for Al-Aqsa Mosque, Jerusalem (1925) * Istanbul 4th Vakƒ±f Han (1926) * Ankara 2nd Vakƒ±f Han (Ankara Evkaf Apartment) died during its construction (1927) Completion of Ankara Palas, a project started by Vedat Tek (1927) Ankara Palas Hotel demonstrates characteristics of the First Turkish national architectural movement. This was Kemalettin Bey's first design project after arriving in Ankara. The hotel was designed in 1924 by Architect Vedad Bey, but when he left the project the hotel was built according to Kemalettin Bey's new design and opened for business in the autumn of 1927. The hotel was the setting for Ankara's important political and social meetings, particularly during the early years of the Republic, and was a venue for welcoming all the important guests of the state. The large balcony with pointed arches on the axially planned rectangular mass' axis, the raised mass and its domed entrance emphasize its orientalist appearance and monumental aspect. There is a magnificent ballroom receiving daylight from above. The limitation of traditional decoration to balcony parapets and console stones balances the Orientalist emphasis. Main building of Turkish State Railways, Ankara (1928) This is Kemalettin Bey's last design. The foundations of the building were made a month after the architect's death and construction was completed in 1928. These multi storey residences that were actually designed for railway employees were used temporarily and then permanently by the administration. According to available documents the building that is identified together with the 19th May Square in front of Ankara Station and the station itself was designed as an apartment built around a spacious inner courtyard. However, only one third of the section in the station direction was completed. In spite of the projections made on each axis for axial emphasis, the central corridor plan and texture of the facade with flat square windows is austere. The decorative ironwork of the high gate opening into the courtyard and the large rosace patterned ironwork in the half circle arch above it is incomparable. Gazi Institute of Education, Ankara (1930) The building of Gazi Institute of Education () is one of Kemalettin Bey's last works. Its design was completed in 1927 and its construction in 1930; the same year in which the school began its educational programme . The building consists of four storeys including the basement and occupies a large rectangular area. Two inner courtyards symmetrically aligned with the entrance axis are surrounded with a corridor system in the axial plan. The midsection on the axis is five storeys high with a sixth floor over the entrance used as an observatorium. The entrance porch accessed by wide steps is indicated with colossal columns and high arches. On the upper veranda a distinctive balance and decorative accent pattern is achieved with the lintels of pairs of flat arched dwarf. The classicist fiction of the 'losenge' patterned colonnades in the entrances allow the magnificence of the building to be sensed on a human scale. Honours * A street across Sirkeci Railway Terminal and crossing Hamidiye Cad., on which his masterpiece Istanbul 4th Vakƒ±f Han is situated, is named in his honour. * In 2009, a new series of Turkish lira banknotes went into circulation.

Dise√±o del Rancho Los GuilicosMexican Land Grants in Sonoma County History The four square league grant was made to Captain John Wilson (1797 - 1861), a Scottish-born sea captain and trader, who came to California in 1830.Martha Voght ,Scots in Hispanic California, The Scottish Historical Review, Vol. 52, No. 154, Part 2 (Oct., 1973), pp. 137-148, Edinburgh University Press In 1837 Wilson married Mar√≠a Ramona Carrillo de Pacheco (1812‚Äì1888), widow of Jos√© Antonio Romualdo Pacheco, who was killed at the Battle of Cahuenga Pass in 1831. Carrillo, was a daughter of Maria Ygnacia Lopez de Carrillo, the grantee of Rancho Cabeza de Santa Rosa. Mar√≠a's sister married General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo.Maria Ygnacia Lopez de Carrillo Mar√≠a Ramona Carrillo de Pacheco was also the grantee of Rancho Suey. Wilson and his business partner, James Scott (-1851), also owned Rancho El Chorro and Rancho Ca√±ada de los Osos y Pecho y Islay in San Luis Obispo County. In 1845, Wilson moved his family from San Luis Obispo to Rancho Ca√±ada de los Osos & Pacheco y Islay, built an adobe home and lived there until his death in 1860. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Los Guilicos was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852,United States. District Court (California : Northern District) Land Case 94 ND and the grant was patented to John Wilson in 1886. Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886 Wilson never occupied Rancho Los Guilicos, and in 1849, sold the rancho to William Hood and William Pettit. Scotsman William Hood (1818-) had come to San Francisco by way of Chile. As the son of a ship builder he'd learned the trade and became a cabinet maker before embarking on his international travel. Hood set up a carpentry business in San Francisco and, sometime around 1846, traveled to north of San Francisco. Reaching the Los Rancho Los Guilicos he climbed the mountain later named after him. Looking down to the countryside below, Hood was impressed with the valley and its potential and resolved to make enough money to purchase the property from Wilson. When gold was discovered in 1848, demand for housing in San Francisco made Hood wealthier than most of the men who'd run off to the gold fields. By 1850, he had earned enough money to purchase a half share in Los Guilicos. The terms of the partnership with William Pettit are unclear. Pettit apparently sold his half of the ranch to Amelia Wilson less than a year later. Together, Hood and Wilson hired James Shaw as ranch foreman. Amelia eventually sold her share to Hood around 1854, giving him sole ownership of the property.Campbell Augustus Menefee,1873,Historical and descriptive sketch book of Napa, Sonoma, Lake, and Mendocino., p.295 Some documents claim that when Hood first purchased the property, he lived in an old adobe. This adobe was apparently a remnant of the few improvements Captain Wilson made during his period of stewardship. Needless to say, nothing from this early period has been discovered.Hood Mansion Talking Points, For Open House, 2008.

Another doctor and a nurse work along with him at the clinic. One day when he is on his rounds, he comes upon a quarrel between a patient and his mother. The patient expresses disgust and claims to have no relationship with his mother. The patient's mother leaves in tears and Dr.Raghavram follows her to tell her that her son is now OK. When he asks her for her name and where she came from, she walks away without answering his questions. The doctor is intrigued and delves into the details of the patient and finds out the patient's name is Vasudeva. After work, the doctors tell his friend that the old woman was from his village. He proceeds to narrate a story from the days of his youth. When the Doctor was merely a young boy he lived in a small village. In that small village lived a wealthy family, Narayana Swamy, his wife Sardamba and their young son, Vasudeva. They were a kind and generous couple who contributed to the welfare of the community. Saradamba, in particular, was regarded as pious, religious, generous and also very beautiful. She would sponsor lunch meals for students. Among the students is a boy called Kanakayya, who was also a very good student. Saradamba is very fond of Kanakayya and showers him with love and affection. Kanakayya too is very fond of Saradamaba and does errands around the house for Saradamba, such as giving her foot massages and plucking mangoes from the garden. One day Kanakayya gets sick. He has a high fever that refuses to break. The village physician, Sri Hari claims it is a stubborn viral fever and gives him medicine but there seems to be no immediate relief. Kanakkaya's fever gets worse and he mutters \\"Saradamba\\" over and over in a delirious state. Kanakayya's family brings in a doctor, Gopayya who practices alternative medicine. Gopayya claims that its \\"Dosha gunam\\", an STD that young men get from having sex with older women. The treatment for Doshagunam is to apply the blood extracted from the thigh region of the older woman into the eyes of the young man. Kanakayya's family struggles with this information and word gets out. Narayana Swamy comes to hear of this and starts to suspect his wife. Saradamba too hears of this from Kanakayya's mother and becomes furious. Later, when Narayana Swamy brings this up with his wife it results in a huge quarrel. Kanakayya gets even worse and Gopayya claims there is no more time to lose. Kanakayya's father approaches Narayana Swamy for Saradamba's blood. Fearing the boy's death might result in greater scandal, Narayana Swamy extracts the blood from Saradamba forcefully. Sometime after Gopayya administers the blood to Kanakayya, the boy recovers from the grips of the viral fever. Narayana Swamy upon hearing that Kanakaya is now better, accuses his wife of infidelity and makes her leave the village. Kanakkaya learns of what happened when he recovers but no one is willing to listen to him. The Doctor asks his friend about his take on the story. The friend replies that there is no way to tell what actually happened but must take into consideration that Kanakayya did get better. perhaps there was an illicit relationship between Kanakkaya and Saradamba. The Doctor counters by saying that it might have merely been a coincidence that Kanakkaya's fever broke after the application of blood. The friend replies that there is no way to conclude this and that the nature of the relationship is only known to two people, Kanakkaya and Saradamaba. At this point, the doctor reveals that he is Kanakkaya and that there was nothing illicit between him and Saradamba. He moved out of his house, went to Madras to become a Doctor and changed his name.

History With the influx of Jews to Jamaica in the 17th century, multiple synagogues were constructed across the island in such cities as Montego Bay, Spanish Town, Port Royal, and Kingston. Originally, two synagogues were built in Spanish Town, the Sephardi K.K. Neveh Shalom (\\"Habitation of Peace\\") consecrated in 1704, and the Ashkenazi K.K. Mikveh Yisrael (\\"Hope of Israel\\") erected in 1796. These two congregations would later merge as Jews began to migrate from Spanish Town to Kingston, the new capital city. As in Spanish Town, two congregations (Sephardi and Ashkenazi) existed in Kingston. Initial attempts to form a merger were unsuccessful. The United Congregation of Israelites constructed the original Sha'are Shalom synagogue in 1885, but an earthquake destroyed it. The building was reconstructed by the Henriques Brothers in 1912. This structure still stands. In 1921, the Ashkenazi community merged with the Sha'are Shalom Synagogue to form a unified congregation which continues to exist.Jamaica at Jewish Virtual Library On 23 March 2002, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan visited Shaare Shalom, his first visit to a synagogue, in an attempt to repair his controversial relationship with the Jewish community.\\"Louis Farrakhan's first visit to a Jewish Synagogue... 'It took courage to bring me here'\\" , Jamaica Gleaner, 26 March 2002. Farrakhan was accepted to speak at Sha'are Shalom in the native country of his father, after being rejected to appear at American synagogues, many of whom had fear of sending the wrong signal to the Jewish community. Today The synagogue can accommodate more than 600 persons for services in its sanctuary. Its sanctuary floor is covered in sand (from the Sephardi custom) to remind persons of the time when Jews covered their floors with sand to muffle the sound of their prayers during the Spanish Inquisition. The sanctuary also features a 52-stop pipe organ. Though once an Orthodox community, the Sha'are Shalom synagogue now belongs to the Reform branch of Judaism, also incorporating prayers in both Hebrew and English. The congregation maintains the Hillel Academy, one of the top prep schools in Jamaica. The school has a total enrollment of more than 800 students and maintains a non-denominational status. It additionally maintains a museum of Jamaican Jewish history adjacent to the synagogue. As a collector of historical Judaica from all over the island, it is considered one of the finest historical collections in the Caribbean. On June 24, 2012, a Nyabinghi (a Rastafarian sect) concert was held at the synagogue as a part of the Kingston On The Edge urban arts festival.

The Bajalan Pass was noted by foreign travelers for its monasteries, bridges, castles and aqueducts.Island of salvation, W≈Çodzimierz Odojewski History 17th century The Bajalans, under the command of their leader Abdal Bey, participated on the side of the Ottomans in the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1623‚Äì39); numbered some 4000, they fought successfully against the Persians and helped Sultan Murad IV conquer Baghdad in 1638. Murad IV, in recognition of services rendered to the Ottoman Empire in the capture of Baghdad, rewarded Abdal Bey and his descendants with the title of Pasha (of one tail) and hereditary rights to the newly established Zohab Pashalik under the Treaty of Zuhab of 1639. The Sultan ceded Zohab to Abdal Bey on the condition that he sols raise 2,000 horsemen when required, and pay a yearly tribute of 300,000 piastres to the State. However, in reality as an Ottoman vassal, they were lightly taxed and furnished a body of 1,200 horsemen to the crown.Historical gazetteer of Iran, Volume 3, Ludwig W.

The pashalik of Zohab was a district of considerable extent, lying at the foot of the ancient Zagros, the capital was surrounded by a mud wall. The Pashalik was dependent upon that of Bagdad, and consisted of two divisions, Derna and Zehav. The Bajalan tribe was made up of a confederacy of lesser sub-tribes who were loyal to the Bajalan family and its Pasha, the first main sub tribe was Jumur (Jomur) which itself had nine branches including Hajilar, Gharibawand, Shirawand (Siravand), Charkalao, Mamawand, Daudawand (Dandavand), Zorkh (Sorkh) and Jalil Agha, the second main tribe was Qazanlu which had three branches, Haji Khalil, Wali Agha, Abdurrahman Agha.

It is a biochemical laboratory method for the characterization and identification of the DNA or RNA sequences of cancer cell(s). Unlike whole genome (WG) sequencing which is typically from blood cells, such as J. Craig Venter's and James D. Watson‚Äôs WG sequencing projects, saliva, epithelial cells or bone - cancer genome sequencing involves direct sequencing of primary tumor tissue, adjacent or distal normal tissue, the tumor micro environment such as fibroblast/stromal cells, or metastatic tumor sites. Similar to whole genome sequencing, the information generated from this technique include: identification of nucleotide bases (DNA or RNA), copy number and sequence variants, mutation status, and structural changes such as chromosomal translocations and fusion genes. Cancer genome sequencing is not limited to WG sequencing and can also include exome, transcriptome, micronome sequencing, and end-sequence profiling. These methods can be used to quantify gene expression, miRNA expression, and identify alternative splicing events in addition to sequence data. The first report of cancer genome sequencing appeared in 2006. In this study 13,023 genes were sequenced in 11 breast and 11 colorectal tumors. A subsequent follow up was published in 2007 where the same group added just over 5,000 more genes and almost 8,000 transcript species to complete the exomes of 11 breast and colorectal tumors. The first whole cancer genome to be sequenced was from cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukaemia by Ley et al. in November 2008. The first breast cancer tumor was sequenced by Shah et al. in October 2009, the first lung and skin tumors by Pleasance et al. in January 2010, and the first prostate tumors by Berger et al. in February 2011.  History  Historically, cancer genome sequencing efforts has been divided between transcriptome-based sequencing projects and DNA-centered efforts. The Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (CGAP) was first funded in 1997 with the goal of documenting the sequences of RNA transcripts in tumor cells. As technology improved, the CGAP expanded its goals to include the determination of gene expression profiles of cancerous, precancerous and normal tissues. The CGAP published the largest publicly available collection of cancer expressed sequence tags in 2003. The Sanger Institute's Cancer Genome Project, first funded in 2005, focuses on DNA sequencing. It has published a census of genes causally implicated in cancer, and a number of whole-genome resequencing screens for genes implicated in cancer. The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) was founded in 2007 with the goal of integrating available genomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic data from many different research groups. As of December 2011, the ICGC includes 45 committed projects and has data from 2,961 cancer genomes available.  Societal Impact   The Complexity and Biology of Cancer  The process of tumorigenesis that transforms a normal cell to a cancerous cell involve a series of complex genetic and epigenetic changes. Identification and characterization of all these changes can be accomplished through various cancer genome sequencing strategies. The power of cancer genome sequencing lies in the heterogeneity of cancers and patients. Most cancers have a variety of subtypes and combined with these ‚Äòcancer variants‚Äô are the differences between a cancer subtype in one individual and in another individual. Cancer genome sequencing allows clinicians and oncologists to identify the specific and unique changes a patient has undergone to develop their cancer. Based on these changes, a personalized therapeutic strategy can be undertaken.  Clinical Relevance  A big contribution to cancer death and failed cancer treatment is clonal evolution at the cytogenetic level, for example as seen in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). In a Nature study published in 2011, Ding et al. identified cellular fractions characterized by common mutational changes to illustrate the heterogeneity of a particular tumor pre- and post-treatment vs. normal blood in one individual. These cellular factions could only have been identified through cancer genome sequencing, showing the information that sequencing can yield, and the complexity and heterogeneity of a tumor within one individual.  Comprehensive Cancer Genomic Projects  The two main projects focused on complete cancer characterization in individuals, heavily involving sequencing include the Cancer Genome Project, based at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and the Cancer Genome Atlas funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). Combined with these efforts, the International Cancer Genome Consortium (a larger organization) is a voluntary scientific organization that provides a forum for collaboration among the world's leading cancer and genomic researchers.  Cancer Genome Project (CGP)  The Cancer Genome Projects goal is to identify sequence variants and mutations critical in the development of human cancers. The project involves the systematic screening of coding genes and flanking splice junctions of all genes in the human genome for acquired mutations in human cancers. To investigate these events, the discovery sample set will include DNA from primary tumor, normal tissue (from the same individuals) and cancer cell lines. All results from this project are amalgamated and stored within the COSMIC cancer database. COSMIC also includes mutational data published in scientific literature.  The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)  The TCGA is a multi-institutional effort to understand the molecular basis of cancer through genome analysis technologies, including large-scale genome sequencing techniques. Hundreds of samples are being collected, sequenced and analyzed. Currently the cancer tissue being collected include: central nervous system, breast, gastrointestinal, gynecologic, head and neck, hematologic, thoracic, and urologic. The components of the TCGA research network include: Biospecimen Core Resources, Genome Characterization Centers, Genome Sequencing Centers, Proteome Characterization Centers, a Data Coordinating Center, and Genome Data Analysis Centers. Each cancer type will undergo comprehensive genomic characterization and analysis. The data and information generated is freely available through the projects TCGA data portal.  International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC)  The ICGC‚Äôs goal is ‚ÄúTo obtain a comprehensive description of genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic changes in 50 different tumor types and/or subtypes which are of clinical and societal importance across the globe‚Äù.  Technologies and platforms  2nd Generation Sequencing 3rd Generation Sequencing Cancer genome sequencing utilizes the same technology involved in whole genome sequencing. The history of sequencing has come a long way, originating in 1977 by two independent groups - Fredrick Sanger‚Äôs enzymatic didoxy DNA sequencing technique and the Allen Maxam and Walter Gilbert chemical degradation technique. Following these landmark papers, over 20 years later ‚ÄòSecond Generation‚Äô high-throughput next generation sequencing (HT-NGS) was born followed by ‚ÄòThird Generation HT-NGS technology‚Äô in 2010. The figures to the right illustrate the general biological pipeline and companies involved in second and third generation HT-NGS sequencing. Three major second generation platforms include Roche/454 Pyro-sequencing, ABI/SOLiD sequencing by ligation, and Illumina‚Äôs bridge amplification sequencing technology. Three major third generation platforms include Pacific Biosciences Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing, Oxford Nanopore sequencing, and Ion semiconductor sequencing.  Data Analysis  The work-flow of the sequencing of a tumor from biopsy to treatment recommendation. As with any genome sequencing project, the reads must be assembled to form a representation of the chromosomes being sequenced. With cancer genomes, this is usually done by aligning the reads to the human reference genome. Since even non-cancerous cells accumulate somatic mutations, it is necessary to compare sequence of the tumor to a matched normal tissue in order to discover which mutations are unique to the cancer. In some cancers, such as leukemia, it is not practical to match the cancer sample to a normal tissue, so a different non-cancerous tissue must be used. It has been estimated that discovery of all somatic mutations in a tumor would require 30-fold sequencing coverage of the tumor genome and a matched normal tissue. By comparison, the original draft of the human genome had approximately 65-fold coverage. A major goal of cancer genome sequencing is to identify driver mutations: genetic changes which increase the mutation rate in the cell, leading to more rapid tumor evolution and metastasis. It is difficult to determine driver mutations from DNA sequence alone; but drivers tend to be the most commonly shared mutations amongst tumors, cluster around known oncogenes, and are tend to be non-silent. Passenger mutations, which are not important in the progression of the disease, are randomly distributed throughout the genome. It has been estimated that the average tumor carries c.a. 80 somatic mutations, fewer than 15 of which are expected to be drivers. A personal-genomics analysis requires further functional characterization of the detected mutant genes, and the development of a basic model of the origin and progression of the tumor. This analysis can be used to make pharmacological treatment recommendations. As of February 2012, this has only been done for patients clinical trials designed to assess the personal genomics approach to cancer treatment.  Limitations  A large-scale screen for somatic mutations in breast and colorectal tumors showed that many low-frequency mutations each make small contribution to cell survival. If cell survival is determined by many mutations of small effect, it is unlikely that genome sequencing will uncover a single \\"Achilles heel\\" target for anti-cancer drugs. However, somatic mutations tend to cluster in a limited number of signalling pathways, which are potential treatment targets. Cancers are heterogeneous populations of cells. When sequence data is derived from a whole tumor, information about the differences in sequence and expression pattern between cells is lost. This difficulty can be ameliorated by single-cell analysis. Clinically significant properties of tumors, including drug resistance, are sometimes caused by large-scale rearrangements of the genome, rather than single mutations. In this case, information about single nucleotide variants will be of limited utility. Cancer genome sequencing can be used to provide clinically relevant information in patients with rare or novel tumor types. Translating sequence information into a clinical treatment plan is highly complicated, requires experts of many different fields, and is not guaranteed to lead to an effective treatment plan. Incidentalome The incidentalome is the set of detected genomic variants not related to the cancer under study. (The term is a play on the name incidentaloma, which designates tumors and growths detected on whole-body imaging by coincidence).Cancer Gene Sequencing Raises New Medical Ethics Issues by Janis C. Kelly. Sep 06, 2013 The detection of such variants may result in additional measures such as further testing or lifestyle management.

In 1912 she was sold to F. Laeisz, Hamburg, Germany. During the First World War she was interned in Chile, and postwar was assigned to the United Kingdom as war reparations. She was sold back to Laiesz in 1921. She was sold in 1931 to Ruben De Cloux & Alan Villiers of Mariehamn, Finland. Following an accident in 1936, she was sold and hulked at Haifa, British Mandate of Palestine, now Israel, for two years before being scrapped. Description Arrow was built by A Rodger & Co, Port Glasgow as yard number 361. She was long, with a beam of and a depth of . She had four masts and was rigged as a barque, with royal sails over double top and topgallant sails. Arrow was completed in April 1902. She was a sister ship to Eclipse, which was completed two months later. History Arrow entered service with the Anglo-American Oil Co Ltd, London, employed in the kerosene trade. In 1912, she was sold to F Laeisz, Hamburg for ¬£15,000 and was renamed Parma. She was employed in the nitrate trade between Germany and Chile. At the outbreak of the First World War, Parma was interned at Iquique, Chile. In 1920, she was assigned to the United Kingdom as war reparations. In 1921, she was transferred to the Belgian Government, and placed under the management of Association Maritime Belge, Antwerp. On 8 November 1921, Parma was sold back to F Laeisz for ¬£10,000. She was again employed in the nitrate trade. In 1926, Parma sailed from Hamburg to Talcahuano, Chile in 86 days and in 1928 she sailed from Land's End to Talcahuano in 70 days. In 1931, Parma was sold to Ruben De Cloux and Alan Villiers of Mariehamn, Finland for RM34,000. She was the largest sailing ship under the Finnish flag at the time, holding that position until 1935 when Gustaf Erikson bought Moshulu. She was employed in the wheat trade between Germany and Australia. In 1933, she sailed from Port Victoria to Falmouth in 83 days. This was the fastest ever achieved by a sailing ship. On 1 July 1936, Parma collided with an observation tower at Princes Dock, Glasgow when a gust of wind caught her as she was docking. As a result of the collision, plates in her hull were sprung open by falling coping stones from the quayside. Parma was sold to Rederei A/B Parma U V Wennstrom, Mariehamn. She was stripped of her masts and rigging, and converted to a hulk. In 1936, Parma was sold to Barnett Bros, London. Parma served as a hulk at Haifa, Palestine (now Israel), until 1938 when she was scrapped. A model of Parma can be seen at the √Ölands Sj√∂fartsmuseum, Mariehamn. Captains The captains of Parma were:- * T√∂pper (1924‚Äì26) * Holst (1926‚Äì27) * Rohwer (1928‚Äì29) * Brockh√∂ft (1928‚Äì29) * Ruben de Cloux (1931‚Äì36) Official Numbers and Code Letters Official Numbers were a forerunner to IMO Numbers.

He was a noted authority on copyright and played an instrumental role in shaping the Copyright Act of 1909. Early life Thorvald Solberg was born in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. He was the eldest of six children born of immigrant Norwegian parents. Solberg attended public schools, working for booksellers after graduation in Manitowoc, Boston, Detroit, Knoxville, and Omaha. On May 1, 1876, Solberg began working in the Library of Congress as a cataloguer. In 1876, he became part of the Library's law department staff, despite not being a lawyer. While there, he played an active role in the direction and control of the Library's copyright registration and deposit functions. He remained in that position until he left the Library altogether in 1889 to work for the Boston Book Company. Register of Copyrights In 1897, Congress created the United States Copyright Office as a separate department of the Library of Congress to handle the administrative functions of copyright law. Solberg was widely supported to become the first head of the Office due to his growing reputation as a national authority on copyright (and due to some lobbying on his own part for the post).Cole, John Y., Of Copyright, Men & a National Library, The Quarterly Journal of the Library of Congress, Vol. 28, April 1971. After being interviewed by President William McKinley, Solberg was appointed by Librarian of Congress John Russell Young and took office as the first Register of Copyrights on July 22, 1897, with an annual salary of $3000 and a staff of 29 clerks. During his tenure as Register, Solberg played an active role in advancing United States copyright law. He advocated copyright reform and was instrumental in the passage of the Copyright Act of 1909, one of the most significant revisions in United States copyright law. He was known as a champion for the rights of authors and supported relaxing the registration and deposit requirements of copyright law, consistent with the shift away from copyright formalities in the Berne Convention. Solberg also pushed for the United States to join the Berne Convention. Thorvald Solberg retired as Register on April 21, 1930, his 78th birthday. He remains the longest-serving Register of Copyrights. Personal life Thorvald Solberg was married to Mary Adelaide Nourse of Lynn, Massachusetts. He resided on Capitol Hill when he began his stint as Register of Copyrights. In 1914, Solberg moved to Glen Echo, Maryland, where he resided until his death. Solberg was a prolific writer, and he compiled several bibliographies and compilations of United States and foreign copyright laws.

History Built in around 1776 as a warehouse for the Leeds & Liverpool Canal Company, the Granary Building is a Grade II* listed building. It stands by Lock No.1 (the ‚ÄùRiver Lock‚Äù) of the canal. It is regarded as ‚Äúan important survival from the extensive range of buildings at the end of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at its junction with the River Aire and close to the boundary of the Aire and Calder Navigation. The building was designed by Robert Owen, engineer for the canal company, and was unusual in that a branch of the canal ran into the building allowing loading of barges under cover. Significant remodelling took place in the mid to late 19th century including the addition of the single-storey extension to the west. Internal timber floors were replaced with cast-iron columns and fire-proof brick arches to reduce the risk of fire. Conversion to its current use was undertaken in the mid 1990s including the insertion of additional windows and raising the height of the top storey to satisfy current standards for ceiling heights, work undertaken by the engineering firm Abbey Pynford. The main building is now the headquarters for BMB Group Ltd, a menswear company, and the later extension is Heathcotes restaurant.

Completed in 1944, the ship spent most of the war assigned to the Eastern and Pacific Fleets. She screened British aircraft carriers as their aircraft attacked targets in the Japanese-occupied Nicobar Islands, the Dutch East Indies, Formosa and near Okinawa. Whelp was present at the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay in 1945 and later in Hong Kong. She was paid off in January 1946 and went into reserve. Whelp was sold to the South African Navy (SAN) in 1952 and renamed Simon van der Stel. She was subsequently converted into a fast anti-submarine frigate in the early 1960s and served as a training ship from 1968 until 1972 when she went back into reserve. Simon van der Stel was recommissioned in 1975 for a refit, but that proved to be uneconomical and she was scrapped the following year.  Description  The W-class ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a mean deep draught of . The ships were powered by a pair of Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of which gave a maximum speed of . They carried of fuel oil that gave them a range of at . Their crew numbered 179 officers and ratings. The W-class destroyers were armed with four single 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns, one quadruple mount for 2-pounder (40 mm) Mk II \\"pom-pom\\" anti-aircraft (AA) guns and eight Oerlikon light AA guns on twin mounts. They also were equipped with two quadruple mounts for 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. For anti-submarine work, the ships were fitted with ASDIC and two rails and four throwers for 70 depth charges.Raven & Roberts, pp. 48‚Äì49 They were equipped with a Type 272 surface-search radar, Type 282 and 285 gunnery radars and a Type 291 early-warning radar.Lenton, p. 178 To better defend the ship against Japanese kamikaze suicide aircraft, Whelp had her searchlight replaced by a Bofors AA gun in mid-1944. As part of her 1962‚Äì64 refit, the ship's aft torpedo tubes were removed to make room for a small flight deck and hangar for two Westland Wasp helicopters. A pair of Bofors guns were added, one on each side of the hangar, but these were later replaced by the originally intended pair of American Mk 32 triple-barrelled anti-submarine torpedo tubes. The main guns were replaced by two twin-gun turrets fitted with 4-inch (102 mm) Mk XVI guns, one forward of the bridge and the other aft of the hangar. Her electronics were modernized as well although she retained the existing search radar. The changes increased her crew to 186‚Äì210 officers and ratings.du Toit, pp. 196, 199 Construction and career British service The W-class destroyers were ordered on 3 December 1941 and Whelp was laid down by Hawthorn Leslie and Company at their shipyard in Hebburn on 1 May 1942. The ship was launched on 3 June 1943 and completed on 14 July 1944. She was initially assigned to the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet and was based in Scapa Flow. During her active service, her captain and first lieutenant were Commander G. A. F. Norfolk and Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten (now Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh), respectively. In mid-June, Whelp sailed to Spitsbergen to resupply the small Allied garrison there. Whelp was then assigned to the 27th Destroyer Flotilla which left for the Far East on 2 August and arrived in Trincomalee, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), on 12 September. En route, the ship covered the Allied invasion of Southern France (Operation Dragoon) in mid-August. By October, the 27th DF was assigned to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean and Whelp escorted the aircraft carriers and while their aircraft attacked Nancowry harbour and other targets in the Nicobar Islands as part of Operation Millet. When the Eastern Fleet attempted to attack the oil refinery complex at Pangkalan Brandan, Sumatra, in mid-November, Whelp and her sister ship escorted the oiler . The British Pacific Fleet (BPF) was formed a few days afterwards and attacked the refinery at Belawan Deli during Operation Robson a month later, as the ship escorted the main body of the fleet. She did much the same during Operation Lentil, another attack on the refinery at Pangkalan Brandan at the beginning of January 1945. Whelp was then detached to tow the damaged submarine to Trincomalee, arriving on 8 January. The BPF departed from the port eight days later, bound for Sydney, Australia. En route its aircraft attacked the refineries in Plaju and Sungai Gerong, Sumatra, on 24 and 29 January (Operation Meridian I & II) before arriving on 10 February.English, p. 103; Hobbs, pp. 57, 61, 64, 73, 241; Rohwer, pp. 373, 377, 388 Whelp rescued the crew of a crashed Grumman TBF Avenger, Sub-Lieutenant Roy Halliday and his gunner, Norman Richardson, during the second attack. On 28 February, the BPF sailed for their forward base at Manus Island and arrived on 7 March and exercised together before sailing for Ulithi on 18 March. The BPF joined the American Fifth Fleet there two days later to participate in the preliminary operations for the invasion of Okinawa. The British role during the operation was to neutralise airfields on the Sakishima Islands, between Okinawa and Formosa, beginning on 26 March. They later attacked airfields in Formosa before returning to the Sakishima Islands. The BPF retired to Leyte Gulf to rest and resupply on 17 AprilHobbs, pp. 126‚Äì51; Rohwer, p. 402 and Whelp, together with Wager, was tasked to escort the badly damaged carrier to Sydney on 3 May.McCart, pp. 30, 32 They arrived on 14 May and Whelp continued on to Melbourne to begin a refit that lasted until July.English, p. 103 She rejoined the BPF at Sydney (now attached to the United States 3rd Fleet) and on 31 July escorted the battleship to Guam, together with Wager, where they arrived on 9 August. Admiral Bruce Fraser, Commander-in-chief of the BPF, conferred with U.S. Admiral Chester Nimitz, the Commander-in-Chief Pacific Fleet Headquarters. The ships then proceeded to rendezvous with the main body of the fleet off the coast of Japan on the 16th. Whelp was the first Allied ship to enter Sagami Bay on 27 August, leading the way for Duke of York and the American battleships and . She was present at Tokyo for the formal surrender of the Japanese on 2 September. She left Tokyo on 9 September and, following an overnight stop at Okinawa on 11/12 September, arrived at Hong Kong with Admiral Fraser aboard. He accepted the surrender of the Japanese forces in Hong Kong on 16 September. Whelp was remained in Hong Kong and conducted anti- piracy patrols along the Chinese coast. On 12 November, the ship departed Hong Kong for Sydney, via Darwin, and arrived there on the 24th to begin a brief refit. She sailed for Britain on 7 December and arrived at Portsmouth on 17 January 1946. Whelp was paid off and was in Category B reserve by 30 May. She was recommissioned on 9 August 1947 and refitted at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard in September‚ÄìOctober preparation for the voyage to South Africa in company with her sisters, , and to form the South Atlantic Reserve Force in Simon's Town. Whelp was damaged while in dock on 8 September 1949. She was scheduled to be converted into a Type 62 air defence frigate, but this was cancelled when that programme was abandoned.du Toit, p. 195; English, pp. 101‚Äì03 South African service Whelp was offered to South Africa in 1950, together with Wessex, but she was not purchased until 25 April 1952 for ¬£420,000. The ship was commissioned on 23 February 1953 and was renamed Simon van der Stel, after the first governor of Cape Colony. Much of the ship's service was as a \\"grey ambassador\\", on goodwill visits to Europe and the European colonies in Africa, including a 147-day cruise to Europe in 1954 with Commander M. R. Terry-Lloyd in command. This began on 14 July, when she departed Durban on what was the longest flag-showing cruise ever by an SAN warship. En route to Portsmouth, Simon van der Stel stopped in Freetown, Sierra Leone, and Dakar, French West Africa and arrived there on 31 July. Then she became the first SAN ship to visit, when the warship berthed in Rotterdam, Netherlands, Derry, Northern Ireland, and Glasgow, Scotland. On 21 October, the ship escorted (the former HMS Brayford, a new back home. On their way to Durban, the ships visited France, Portugal, the Canary Islands, Dakar, French West Africa, and French Equatorial Africa before arriving at their destination on 8 December, Simon van der Stel having steamed some .du Toit, pp. 195‚Äì96, 200 This role, however, declined as South Africa became increasingly isolated during the apartheid years. The ship was placed in reserve from 1957, but was modernised at Simon's Town Naval Dockyard from 1962 to 1964, and re- commissioned on 27 February 1964. Simon van der Stel remained in commission for just over a year as manpower shortages mandated that she be reduced back to reserve in March 1965. The ship was recommissioned on 17 June 1968 and was briefly assigned to the 10th Frigate Squadron until she was redesignated as a training ship on 1 October. Simon van der Stel visited Portuguese Mozambique later that month. In June 1969, she was ordered to proceed to Gough Island to search for two missing members of the weather station there, but only found their bodies. The ship was replaced in her training role by her sister in 1972 and she was paid off on 27 March. Simon van der Stel was reactivated with a skeleton crew in early 1975 for a refit at Durban, but she was deemed too expensive to repair and was scrapped there by Sandock-Austral in late 1976.du Toit, pp. 196‚Äì97; English, p. 104 Footnotes Publications     External links * HMS Whelp on naval-history.net Category:W and Z-class destroyers Category:Ships built on the River Tyne Category:1943 ships Category:World War II destroyers of the United Kingdom Category:Cold War destroyers of the United Kingdom Category:Type 15 frigates of the South African Navy Simon van der Stel ","title":"HMS Whelp (R37)"},{"id":"26062767","text":"The Stony Mountain Formation is a stratigraphical unit of Ashgill age in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.

He was the father of Halvdan Koht, historian and Labour Party politician. Having developed a penchant for Greek and Roman poetry in his student years, Koht lectured in philology as an adult. He also taught living languages, most notably Norwegian. Despite the conservative political views of his family, Koht became fascinated by the radical national liberal movement of the late 19th century. His first political activism was manifested in his editing of Troms√∏posten; in the late 1870s and early 1880s he chaired the Troms√∏ Labour Association, which catapulted him into the political limelight. Eventually becoming elected as both city mayor and Member of Parliament, he advocated radical reforms, amongst them common suffrage and the eight-hour day. Early life and educational career He was born at Bod√∏ in Nordland, Norway. He was the son of Joachim Andreas Koht, a pharmacist, and Johanne Andrea Conradi. Koht finished secondary education in 1861 and graduated with a cand. philol. degree in 1868. Koht's biographer, Bernt A. Nissen, maintained that he developed his literary taste while studying: the circle spending their leisure time in \\"the green chamber\\" of the Students' Society had, according to Nissen, a decisive influence on Koht. In a bulletin titled Samfundsblade, Koht‚Äîtogether with Sofus Arctander, Ole Furu and Hans Brecke‚Äîrecited Ancient Greek and Latin poems. In the year following his graduation, Koht started his tuition at Norwegian schools. Inspired by the classical languages of his formative years, he taught Ancient Greek and Classical Latin in addition to Standard Norwegian‚Äîhe taught those languages for the remainder of his tutorial career. He began at Gjersten School, before moving to Troms√∏, where he taught at the school of his childhood. He was appointed preceptor of that school in 1871. In 1885, Koht moved with his family to Skien, where he would live for the rest of his life. Having been instantaneously appointed head teacher of Skien Upper Secondary School, he travelled to Germany and Switzerland in the subsequent year‚Äîhe had received a travel grant from the government to study the educational systems of German-speaking Europe. On his return to Skien, Koht continued his tuition at the secondary school; amongst his students was his son Halvdan Koht, who, two years before the elder Koht's decease in 1892, took his examen artium there, continuing with philological studies in Kristiania. Political career Coming from a disciplined family of a conservative culture, Koht fell under the spell of the neoteric national liberal ideology, developing a weltanschauung radical for his time. He was the founding editor of Troms√∏posten, which was established in 1872. After only one year, Koht left the paper, disenchanted with its publishing of an article that he felt violated the principles of the newspaper. He entered the board of a local labour association in 1874, and, three years later, was elected into the city council. In 1883 he was voted Mayor of Troms√∏; he acted in that position for two years, concurrently with his tuition at the city's secondary school. Upon his move to Skien he further pursued his career within politics, being elected mayor of the city in 1886. The latest city fire posed a heavy burden onto the newly elected mayor; yet, according to Nissen, Koht administered the task \\"in an outstanding way\\". In 1889 and 1892, he was elected Liberal MP to the Norwegian Parliament from the constituency of Skien. In the parliament, Koht vigorously advocated the universal suffrage, having threatened to abjure the local Liberal Party league from the central party lest the common suffrage be excluded from the party programme. As a member of the Standing Committee on Business and Industry, he dealt with other liberal reforms of the time, amongst them the working time reform, the Factory Supervision Act of 1892 () and an intergovernmental arbitration reform‚ÄîKoht's positions on these issues were considerably more radical than those of the other committeepeople. Personal life In 1871 he married Betty Gi√¶ver (1845‚Äì1936), a merchant's daughter whose great-grandfather was the civil servant Jens Holmboe. They were the parents of four children, the most famous of whom was historian Halvdan Koht. He was the grandfather of √Öse Gruda Skard (1905‚Äì85) and Paul Koht (1913‚Äì2002).

Ximenes (December 5, 1919 ‚Äì February 27, 2014) was an American civil servant active in advocating for the civil rights of Mexican Americans.  Early life  Ximenes was born in 1919 and raised in the town of Floresville, Texas, where he, along with the Mexican American community, were subjected to racial segregation. After graduating from Floresville High School in 1939, Ximenes became a chief clerk in the Civilian Conservation Corps. Ximenes also enrolled in the University of Texas at Austin where he became friends with Dr. Hector P. Garcia, who would later organize the Mexican American civil rights organization the American GI Forum. Accomplishments in civil rights *In February 1957, Ximenes was made aware of a racist incident in Colorado, where a local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution refused to allow a Mexican-American boy to carry the flag in that year's President Lincoln Day ceremony.http://www.unm.edu/~wac/files/CommunityLiteracyJournalFall2012Vol71.pdf As the national chairman of the American GI Forum, Ximenes took the lead in publicizing this incident with local and national press. Ximenes also sent telegrams to the national office of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the American GI Forum. UNM Professor, and Ximenes biographer, Michelle Kells explains that, \\"the Denver Star and Amarillo Globe-Times noted that the Lincoln Day flag-carrying pageant had been immediately cancelled following Ximenes's complaint [and] DAR National President Freder√≠c Graves responded immediately by pulling the charter from the local Denver DAR chapter. She contacted Ximenes and offered to travel to Albuquerque to exchange flags with the American GI Forum as an act of reconciliation. Ximenes had to decide how much more negative press he wanted to promote, heaping political coals on the head of the DAR. However, Ximenes chose to take a restorative justice approach to the conflict, engaging in negotiations with DAR President Freder√≠c Graves. The flag exchange ceremony was promptly staged in front of the American GI Forum building in Albuquerque.\\" *In 1967, on very short notice President Lyndon B. Johnson tasked Ximenes with reorganizing what became the El Paso hearings. The meetings and hearings that took place at the El Paso hearings were the catalyst for more civil rights policy benefiting Mexican-Americans than may ever be calculated. Meetings on issues of language, education, labor and legal defense all took place during the El Paso hearings. As Professor Craig A. Kaplowitz notes, \\"the committee hearings designed to quell Mexican American frustration ironically gave rise to a grass-roots movement to form a national opposition political base.\\" Hispanic-American rights author Henry A. J. Ramos explains that, \\"the year that followed the hearings saw important and unprecedented administration initiatives on behalf of Hispanic Americans.\\" Career When the US became involved in World War II in 1941, Ximenes volunteered to join the U.S. Air Force. Ximenes graduated from Bombardier School at Kirtland Air Force Base as a 2nd Lieutenant in 1941. During the war, Ximenes flew 50 missions as a lead bombardier in North Africa and was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery under fire. After serving in the war, he became an Air Force flying instructor at Goodfellow Air Force Base from 1943-1946. Ximenes eventually retired from the Air Force with the rank of Major in 1947. Upon returning home from military service, he realized that racial segregation persisted in his hometown. He later became a member of the American GI Forum after meeting with his old friend, Dr. Garcia. In 1950, he received his Bachelor's degree in Education from the University of New Mexico, and a Master's degree in Economics a year later. Ximenes then worked at the Bureau of Business Research from 1951 to 1961. In 1961, the Kennedy administration selected Ximenes to serve as program officer and economist for the U.S. Agency for International Development in Ecuador, and in 1966, he was named deputy director of the Agency for International Development in Panama. Ximenes was also appointed as Assistant Inspector General for the War on Poverty. The following year, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Ximenes as U.S. commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where he served for five years. Upon his appointment, President Johnson said, \\"Mr. Ximenes' life is a very vivid story of what we call American opportunity. He is a distinguished public servant, a teacher, a war hero, a leader of the Mexican-American community. Today, he achieves another high honor as he becomes a member of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of the United States Government. And we -- as a Nation -- are honored by his achievement.\\" Ximenes directed the historic El Paso hearings in October 1967, which were the turning point in the goal for Hispanics to become part of the mainstream of the United States. In 1967, Ximenes was also selected as the chairman of President Johnson's new Cabinet Committee on Mexican American Affairs, a position he held until 1972. Ximenes' tenure at this position produced changes in federal legislation and regulation that affected the entire nation. From 1972-1973 Ximenes was Vice-President for field operations of the National Urban Coalition. From 1972-1977 Ximenes served as a member of the board of trustees of the University of Albuquerque. In 1977 President Jimmy Carter appointed Ximenes as Commissioner of White House Fellows. He served with former Secretary of HEW John Gardner, Lady Bird Johnson, White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler, Thomas Johnson of the Los Angeles Times, and others. This position empowered Ximenes and others involved to appoint the top scholars and future leaders to serve as White House Fellows in the offices of Cabinet members and the White House. In 2007 Ximenes participated in the UNM Civil Rights Symposium as a speaker at the function.http://www.unm.edu/~wac/History- Legacy/CRS%202007%20Program%20Brochure.pdf  Honors and awards  In 2008, Ximenes was the Honorary Degree Recipient of \\"Doctor of Humane Letters\\" from University of New Mexico. Previously, Ximenes received an Honorary Ph.D. in Humane Letters from New Mexico Highlands University. Vicente Ximenes also has a scholarship established in his name at the University of New Mexico. This scholarship award is given to a graduate student in Rhetoric and Writing whose research or service demonstrates commitment to public rhetoric and civic literacy, and who exemplifies the work of Vicente Ximenes. The scholarship was established by a handful of UNM students and UNM professor Michelle Kells in March 2005. The scholarship maintains its funding entirely through donations. Vicente T. Ximenes is the recipient of numerous other awards including: the Common Cause Public Service Achievement Award, the State of New Mexico Distinguished Service Award, the Vasco Nunez de Balboa, Panama's highest honor and awarded by the president of Panama; the Aztec award by the Mexican- American Opportunity Foundation; the Albuquerque Human Rights Bridge Award by the Albuquerque human rights board; and the De Colores Lifetime Achievement award by the De Colores Board of Directors.  Personal life  Vincente T. Ximenes was married to Maria Ximenes, who died in 2009. Vicente died on February 27, 2014, at the age of 94. Both Vicente and Maria are survived by three of their four children, Ricardo, Olivia and Ana Maria. Their oldest son, Estevan, died in 1978. They also had a granddaughter, Theresa, and two great- granddaughters, Chloe and Madison.  Media coverage  Michelle Hall Kells, Associate Professor of Rhetoric and Writing in the English Department of the University of New Mexico has written about Vicente's political efforts in a book: Vicente Ximenes and LBJ's Great Society: The Rhetoric of Mexican American Civil Rights Reform. Illinois University Press: Illinois. 2018. Dr. Kell's gave a public reading of her work in Albuquerque in April 2018. The LBJ Library published the Civil Rights Summit of 1972 on YouTube. Video of Day 2 of the Summit, which features Vicente Ximenes, can be found hereLBJ Library. \\"Civil Rights Summit of 1972, Day 2 (2 of 4).\\" YouTube. April 5, 2016. Ximenes was featured in a PBS American Experience documentary called The Civilian Conservation Corps which premiered in 2009. Ximenes was featured in a documentary called The Longoria Affair, which premiered in November 2010 on PBS. This documentary, written and directed by John J. Valadez, describes how Mexican-American Rights progressed after a World War II Veteran, Felix Longoria, was refused burial in his home town of Three Rivers Texas because of his ethnicity. In 2010 the Wilson County News published an interview with Ximenes. An article honoring the life of Vicente Ximenes was published in the Albuquerque Journal, March 2, 2014. A chapter in the book, \\"Leaders of the Mexican American Generation\\", edited by Anthony Quiroz and published in 2015 featured Vicente Ximenes and his work in Civil Rights. Legacy Unlike many other well known members of the Mexican-American rights movement in the U.S., Ximenes' legacy is one in which systemic change was attempted from within the government, through years of civil service. Ximenes put it simply in one interview: \\"You have to work with other people to succeed in whatever goal you set out to do.\\" One of Dr. Michelle Hall Kells' students gave a presentation on Vicente Ximenes. The hand-out for that presentation and class discussion can be found here. Several academic, professional, and personal associates of Ximenes speak to his legacy in a posthumous tribute blog for Dr. Ximenes, established to honor Ximenes' legacy shortly after his death in February 2014. One notable reference to Ximenes' legacy, from UNM Provost Chaouki Abdallah, states that, \\"Dr. Ximenes' unparalleled contributions at the state and national-level distinguish him as one of the most influential figures in US civil rights history.\\"http://www.unm.edu/~wac/files/ProvostTributetoVicenteXimenes.pdf Sources *Vicente Ximenes Presentation Video on Civil Rights at econtent.unm.edu *Ximenes Interviewed For The Oral History Project at lib.utexas.edu *Ximenes at silverhorizons.org *Interview at justiceformypeople.org *HM056 at the New Mexico legislature *Vicente T.

The post was named after Mexican general Manuel Mier y Ter√°n. Fort Ter√°n was located at the head of navigation on the Neches River. The flat rock along the riverbed allowed it be crossed by three major trails between Mexican Texas and the United States: the Alabama Trace, the Coushatta Trace, and the Orcoquisac Trace (or Liberty-Nacogdoches Road). As these trails avoided the royal Old San Antonio and Atascosita Roads, they were frequented by smugglers and illegal American immigrants. Following Ter√°n's inspection tour of Texas, the fort was constructed as part of an implementation of Mexican President Anastasio Bustamante's edict banning further American immigration or the importation of further slaves into the territory. Colonel Ellis Bean built and commanded the fort between 1831 and 1832. Almost immediately, most of the troops were transferred south, as the government reduced funding and attempted to resist Santa Anna's rebellion. The remaining soldiers were removed in 1834. During the Battle of Nacogdoches, in the early stages of the Texan Revolution, the Mexican garrison at Fort Nacogdoches fled south past the site, where they were intercepted by a band of Texian rebels. As the custom, rumors of the hidden or abandoned gold led to a number of excavations at the site, including one in 1954 where a man was killed by a premature explosion of his dynamite. After the Battle of San Jacinto led to de facto Texan independence, Samuel Belt operated a ferry and trading post at the site, which developed into a small community on the roads connecting Nacogdoches, Houston, and Jasper. It continued to function as a steamer port and stagecoach crossing until the advent of railroads. The site is now abandoned. The nearest town is Rockland on U.S. Route 69.

It is the highest echelon of state administrative structure offering locus for the exercise of authority by state Government. The secretariat refers to the complex of departments. Its political heads are the ministers while the administrative heads are the Secretaries to the Government. The Government Secretariat is a popular landmark and located in heart of the Thiruvananthapuram City, in Narmada Road. The Secretariat complex was originally constructed as Durbar Hall for Travancore Kingdom.  History  Over 150 years old, the building's foundation stone was laid by His Highness Ayilyam Thirunal, the Maharaja of Travancore in 1865 and was completed in 1869. The original structure was planned to accommodate Travancore Royal Durbar Hall where the King meets his council of ministers on a monthly basis apart from the offices of Peshkars (Secretaries of the State). It was designed and built under Barton, the then chief engineer of Travancore and incorporates elements of Roman and Dutch architecture. The construction was supervised by the then Dewan, T. Madhava Rao, whose statue now stands across the road opposite the building.What the Statues Tell: The Politics of Choosing Symbols in Trivandrum, Robin Jeffrey, Pacific Affairs, Vol. 53, No. 3 (Autumn, 1980), pp. 484-502, p.486 His Highness Chithira Tirunal, the last king of Travancore, was crowned king in a ceremony held at the Secretariat. The Secretariat also housed the Kerala State Legislative Assembly from 1939 before it moved to the new building. Lord Willingdon, the then Viceroy laid the foundation stone for the new Assembly Building on 12 December 1933 and it was opened on 6 February 1939 by Dewan Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer and the Second Sri Mulam popular Assembly convened in this building that year. Known during the princely era as the Huzur or Puthen Kacheri, it was renamed the Government Secretariat in 1949. The Secretariat is the nerve centre of Kerala's governance and hence is also the site of political protests and it often witnesses marches and demonstrations outside its walls.  Structure  The central block Kerala Secretariat Complex consists of 3 blocks. The central block is the oldest structure. The Central Block has main door known as Ana Kavadam (Elephant Door), which opens to the grand Durbar Hall. This Durbar hall earlier was used only by Travancore Maharaja and his courtiers with limited public entry. Today the Durbar Hall is converted into State Ceremonies Hall where public meetings and state ceremonies are held. There are 20 doors located in either side of the Durbar Hall. The Central block has 2 stories and houses offices of various departments. The Old Assembly Hall is located in ground floor of the Central Block at the right, which is now converted into a public legislative museum, depicting the legislative history of Kerala. There are plans to introduce Kerala Institute of Parliamentary Affairs to this complex. Apart from the central block, two new blocks, North Block and South block, were constructed on either side of the central block. The South block was opened by the then Hon. Chief Minister of Kerala Sri. Pattom A. Thanupillai on 18 August 1961. Later two \\"Sandwich\\" blocks were also constructed in between the central and the new blocks. The North Block, located at North Gate, houses office of the Hon. Chief Minister of Kerala, offices of a few cabinet ministers and cabinet room. The South Sandwich Block and North Sandwich Block houses primarily offices Government secretaries, though a few offices of ministers are located here due to congestion in north block.

The length of the forewings is 12‚Äì15 mm for males and 12‚Äì14 mm for females. The caterpillars feed on Tournefortia rufo-sericea, Tournefortia psilostachya, Tournefortia pubescens and Heliotropium curassavicum. The larva is solitary and draws leaves together, fastening their edges, for concealment. Larval specimens have been collected from May to November. The food plants contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which are also stored in the adult moths. These pyrrolizidine alkaloids make the moths unpalatable to the orb-weaving spiders of Eustela vegeta, which release moths that are given to them from their webs. Lava lizards (Microlophus pacificus), however, eat the moths presented to them, suggesting that the endemic nocturnal Utetheisa of Galapagos have lost their aposematic colouration to avoid diurnal lizard predation, but retained their chemical defenses to avoid nocturnal spider predation.

Biography  Manley was born in Junction City, Kansas, in 1893. After she graduated from the University of Illinois, she moved to Miami, Florida, in 1917 where she practised for almost 50 years, contributing to the development of the urban environment. So rare were female architects at the time that when she joined the American Institute of Architects, her acceptance letter and some later correspondence were addressed to 'Mr. Marion Manley'. Manley was one of the designers of the University of Miami campus. Her commissions also included small Spanish-style houses in the 1920s, work on Miami's U.S. Post Office and Federal Building in the 1930s, the masterplan for the Coral Gables campus of the University of Miami with Robert Law Weed and its first large classroom building in the 1940s, many \\"tropical modern\\" houses, the University of Miami's Ring Theater, and the shell for the Asolo Theater at the Ringling Museum in the 1950s. She continued to work through the 1960s and early 1970s. Manley's work encompassed vernacular architecture in residential and public buildings as she drew on local materials suitable for use in the tropical climate of South Florida.  Honors  Manley was twice the President of the American Institute of Architects' South Florida chapter, as well as twice Vice President of the Florida Association of Architects. She received the Gold Medal Award in 1973 from the Florida Association of the American Institute of Architects.

Description The wingspan is 15‚Äì22 mm. Forewings brownish to reddish brown. A dark-brown pre-tornal spot is distinctive in females, but faded in males. Males possess sex scales on the hindwing, hind tibia, and abdomen. Females with a costal fold on forewings, which is absent in males. Eggs are white, round and flat, and laid in small groups of 15 on the fruit. Late instars are 13‚Äì20 mm long. The abdomen of the caterpillar is yellowish white. In the final instar, its color turns to red. Pinacula large and darker than body. Head and prothoracic shield blackish to dark brown in early instars which turns pale to yellowish brown in final instars. Anal comb rudimentary with 4-6 small teeth. Pupa yellow brown. Pest attack It is considered a pest of legumes. The larvae feed in the pods, attacking seeds in the jenkol-pods (Pithecellobium) and only become visible after the seeds are cut. The larva nearly empties the seed, which then only contains tunnels filled with frass. The larvae is a minor polyphagous pest and feeds on a wide range of plants.

Passive trapping methods such as emergence traps, flight traps, malaise traps and sticky traps are ineffective. Bait traps are also found ineffective to catch adults. Light traps, suction traps and pheromone traps are effective. It is also found that the Robinson light trap attracted more males than females. Parasitoids such as Trichogramma cryptophlebiae, Brachymeria pomonae, Gotro bimaculata and Bracon species can be used to destroy eggs and caterpillars. Other methods such as mating disruption, hot water treatments, irradiation and usage of insecticides can also be used. References *Bradley, J. D. 1953.

The Danda Nata festival is being held in the month of Chaitra of every year. As per Ram Prasad Tripathy's article, it is an ancient festival of the Kalinga kingdom and still alive in and around the ancient Kalinga capital Sampa/Samapa i.e modern day Ganjam District. The Participants of Danda are called Danduas (also known as Bhoktas) and they pray Goddesses Kali and Shiva during this 13-, 18- or 21-day Danda period. Danda begins on an auspicious day before the Chaitra Sankranti or Meru Parba with traditional worship and fasting. The total number of days for the festival is 13, 18 or 21 days. Only male persons take part in this festival. The participants are known as the 'Bhoktas'. All the \`Bhoktas\` or 'Danduas' lead a very pious life for all these days during the festival and they avoid eating meat, fish or cohabiting during this period. It is believed that the present day Danda Nata is a part of the ancient Chaitra Yatra festivals being celebrated every year at Taratarini Shakti/Tantra Peetha. The Kalinga Emperors organised this Chaitra festival for their Ista devi, Taratarini. As per folk lore, during ancient period after 20 days of Danda practice the Danduas must assemble near Taratarini Shakti/Tantra Peetha (which is ista devi of the Great Kalinga rulers) and with some hard rituals culminate their Danda on the last day. This practice continued for many years and Chaitra Yatra which is still celebrated at Tara Tarini Shakti/Tantra Peetha in the month of Chaitra, is also another part of that old tradition. But later this Danda Nata spread to different parts of Utkala and Koshala. Now the old tradition was changed. Danda Nata groups increased abnormally and the Danduas culminating their Danda in their own villages or locality instead of Taratarini Shakti/Tantra Peetha.  Etymology  Danda has various meanings, but there are two main meanings of the word # Club, Rod, Pole, Stick, Staff, Sceptre # Punishment, Chastisement The term Nata comes from the word Natya, which gives many different denotations of music, dance and drama. The term Jatra means theatre. Folktale of the origin of the word danda Lord Ganesh was being taught a dance by his father, Lord Shiva. It was a religious dance called Tandava Nritya. In the process of learning the dance, Lord Shiva kicked the stage he was on, and made a sound that sounded like the word \\"Dan\\". Then a piece of brass material broke off the chain Lord Shiva wore around his ankle and fell on a percussion instrument known as Mardala. The brass material hitting the Mardala made a very loud \\"Da\\" noise. Those two sounds were put together to form the word Danda. Danda came to be associated with dance because of that episode.  Danda Nata Ceremony  Danda Nata is an Indian dance festival that originated in the Ganjam district of Odisha. Danda Nata is a form of a religious festival that has theatrical and dance components. The dance is done mainly to worship Lord Shiva, the God of destruction of the Hindu mythology. There are other Gods and Goddesses that are worshiped by the spiritual dance also, such as Krishna Ganesh, Kali, and Durga amongst others. The low caste Hindus and the high caste, such as the Brahmins, all participated in the Danda Nata. The dance along with the accompanying events is performed over the course of three months March, April, and May. Some events are performed in March ‚Äì April, the month of Chaitra, and other events are performed in April ‚Äì May, the month of Vaishakha. People commit self- inflicted wounds to worship Lord Shiva because the philosophy of ancient Hindu says that for a person to be great, one has to have self-control over one's body (Kaya), mind (Mana), and speech (Vakya). So in order to achieve greatness, a lot of punishments, Danda, to the individual must be undergone, so this event is known as Danda Nata. Dance component of the religious festival Danda Nata consists of multiple dances. People start Danda by fasting, having a single meal a day made up of rice and dal, and worshipping their Lord before the actual dances occur. This dance consists of a series of dances which are performed one after another by the male members belonging to the Scheduled Castes and other backward castes. In this dance the Ghasis provide the music with the help of Dhol and Mahuri. The dance has a rich repertory. Parva dance is the first item of the repertory. The Prabhakar and the Prabhakariani, dressed in multi coloured dress, dance in the beginning. The dancer places a piece of cloth on his shoulders and holds the ends of the same in front with both the hands. He moves his hands forward and backward, right and left, to the rhythm of the dance. A semi-circular plate, made of bamboo sticks and covered with coloured and decorated cloth with ornamental border, is tied to the back of the Prabhkar. The Prabhakar wears multi coloured skirt and jacket. The Prabhakariani, a male in female role, dresses himself in sari and kanchala (blouse). The Prabhakariani holds apiece of coloured handkerchief in his hand. After the Parava dance is over the Hara ‚ÄìParvati dance begins. Then a group dance of Fakir and Fakiriani is performed. The dances of Savara and Savarani, Chadeya and Chadouni, are performed one after another. Then the party performs a leela based on a story from the Ramayana or the Mahabharata or from any other Puran through songs and dances . Patarasaura and Patarasaurani perform their dance at the end of the leela. The last, but not the least, is the Binakar who closes the performance with his most significant songs and dances. Then males that belong to backward and scheduled castes perform the Parava dance. In the Parava dance, the Prabhakar, male acting as a male, and the Prabhakariani, a male acting as a female, begin the dance in multi ‚Äì colored clothing. A piece of cloth is placed on the shoulders of dancers. The cloth is held with both hands and the dancers move the cloth backwards and forwards and side to side according to the rhythm of the dance. Then immediately following that dance the Hara ‚Äì Parvati is performed. After those dances are performed, a host of other dances are performed. The Fakir and Fakiriani, a group dance, is performed first. Then the Savara and Savarani are performed with the Chadeya and Chadouni dances being performed directly after. Then everyone gets involved in the festivities by performing a leela through songs and dances, which is based on a story from various Purans. After the leela, the Patarasaura and Patarasaurani perform their traditional dance. Lastly, the Binakar ends the events through dances and songs. The roles of the dancers The various dances of the Danda Nata have various themes behind them. Each of the roles in the dances sing a different tune. Some songs are based on historical stories, while others have a more comical approach. Some groups use a question/answer approach. The groups that use that approach have one role, male or female role, ask questions, while the other role give answers to those replies. Although the songs can be performed through multiple approaches, all the songs have the same style, folk and Odissi. Music The music of the Danda Nata is different for different dances . The songs are of different tunes for different characters. The songs are mainly devotional and mostly based on stories from the epics. Humorous songs are sometimes sung by the dancers . sometimes they put questions in songs and their counterpart give the reply in songs. The songs are of folk and Odissi style. The dance originated from tribal dances, but has been much influenced by the Yatra and Pala performance of the state. Danda Nata is being gradually modernized in respect of music, dance, costume, style and make up. It is thereby losing its original simplicity and traditional characteristics.

It is mostly known by its trademark Tenax.  Properties  Poly(2,6-diphenylphenylene oxide) is a low bleeding material with a low level of impurities, and has a high thermal stability (up to 350 ¬∞C). Before use poly(2,6-diphenylphenylene oxide) should be thermally conditioned with a high purity gas at elevated temperatures to remove any residual components. During conditioning or thermal desorption the presence of oxygen should be avoided. Poly(2,6-diphenylphenylene oxide) reacts with oxidising agents such as chlorine, ozone, nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides forming acetophenone, benzaldehyde and phenol. Therefore, control of blanks is essential and storage time of samples on poly(2,6-diphenylphenylene oxide) is less than a month. Pre-filters based on sodium thiosulphate or Teflon may be appropriate to use. The breakthrough volumes are low for very volatile substances. This problem is partly solved by graphitised poly(2,6-diphenylphenylene oxide). Although the polymer has a low affinity for water, high humidity in air may lower the breakthrough volumes of substances.  Use  Poly(2,6-diphenylphenylene oxide) is used for trapping of volatiles and semi-volatiles from air such as environmental air and human breath, and for personal exposure monitoring. It is also used for determining the emission of chemical substances from plants, soil and commercial products. Volatile substances in liquid or solid matrices can be made available by the purge and trap technique. The polymer is of particularly used for concentration of high boiling compounds such as alcohols, polyethylene glycols, diols, phenols, monoamines and diamines, ethanolamines, amides, aldehydes, ketones and chlorinated aromatics. Poly(2,6-diphenylphenylene oxide) is used as food simulant for testing the release of chemical substances from food contact materials into food.Consolidated text of European COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 18 October 1982 laying down the basic rules necessary for testing migration of the constituents of plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs (82/711/EEC) Office for Official Publications of the European Communities 01/09/1997  Trademarks  Tenax is a registered trademark of Buchem B.V. * Tenax GC (replaced by Tenax TA) * Tenax TA (mesh 20-35, 35-60, 60-80, 80-100, 100-200) * Tenax GR: 23% graphite (mesh 20-35, 35-60, 60-80, 80-100)  References   External links  *Buchem B.V. *SIS *Henry J.

Jointly produced by Ekta Kapoor, Shobha Kapoor and Priya Sreedharan under the banner of ALT Entertainment, the film stars mostly newcomers including Anshuman Jha, Nushrat Bharucha, Rajkummar Rao, Neha Chauhan, Amit Sial, Herry Tangri and Ashish Sharma. It has three separate but interlinked stories about an honour killing, an MMS scandal and sting operations. Banerjee conceived the film after he came across several video clips containing sexual content including the DPS MMS clip and wanted to explore what led to that situation. He then wrote two short stories, which he later expanded into three. The film was made entirely using digital formats with different cameras, including a handycam, an amateur film camera, a security camera, an underwater camera and spy cameras. Nikos Andritsakis served as the film's cinematographer and Namrata Rao was its editor. The film's music was composed by Sneha Khanwalkar and the lyrics were written by Banerjee. Love Sex Aur Dhokha was screened at the 2010 London Indian Film Festival and the Munich International Film Festival. It was released in India on 19 March 2010 to positive reviews from critics. The film was made on a budget of ; it grossed and proved to be a commercial success. Rao and Pritam Das won the Best Editing and the Best Sound Design Award, respectively, at the 56th Filmfare Awards. Khanwalkar received the R. D. Burman Music Award.  Plot   Love (Titled Superhit Pyaar)  Rahul, a young amateur film director in his early 20s decides to make a small-budget film for the diploma of his film course. He conducts audition and meets Shruti, a young girl whom he chooses for the leading role. Shruti belongs to an orthodox family and her father is a real estate magnate. The two bond and become closer, but Shruti's overprotective, aggressive brother overhears their telephone conversation and attacks the film set to find out the identity of the caller. Shruti tells Rahul her father will get her married to someone else; they elope and get married. From their honeymoon suite, they telephone Shruti's family and ask for their acceptance; her father and brother are initially angry but then approve and tell them they will be sending a car to pick them up from the hotel. During the journey, Rahul and Shruti are ambushed by Shruti's brother and his goons who murder them, dismember their bodies with an axe and bury their remains. Sex (Titled Paap ki Dukkaan) Shruti's friend Rashmi is a quiet woman who works night shifts in a supermarket to support her family. Adarsh, a supermarket supervisor, has obtained his job by using his family connections with the store's owner and has debts with loan sharks. He makes a pact with a friend to make a sex tape with one of the employees to sell to the media for a large sum of money; Adarsh chooses Rashmi, for whom he develops genuine feelings. He decides to back out of the plan but his feelings for Rashmi are suppressed by his greed. Rashmi receives news about the gruesome deaths of Shruti and Rahul, and is deeply saddened. Taking advantage of Rashmi's vulnerability, Ardash has sex with her and captures it on the shop's security camera. Having sold the footage, Adarsh is able to pay off his debts. It is later revealed that Rashmi was fired from the supermarket and shunned by her family.  Dhokha (Titled Badnaam Shohorat)  Prabhat, an investigative reporter, is desperate for a sensational story so he will be paid a bonus by the news company that employs him. He saves the life of aspiring dancer Naina, who tries to commit suicide by jumping from a bridge.

Prabhat and Naina take the sting footage to the media, who encourage them to plan another sting; Naina will supposedly blackmail Loki by threatening to reveal the initial footage in an attempt to catch him trying to bribe her‚Äîto render false any accusations by Loki of fabrication of footage. Naina meets Loki in the supermarket where Rashmi works to execute the sting, while Prabhat watches closely. The plan goes awry when Loki tries to steal the camera and shoots Prabhat, who is admitted to the hospital. Naina goes to meet Prabhat to hand over the footage so he can get the bonus, but he decides to protect Naina's dignity, refuses to give his superiors the footage and resigns.

Cast  * Anshuman Jha as Rahul * Nushrat Bharucha as Shruti * Sandeep Bose as Shruti's Dad * Rajkummar Rao as Adarsh * Neha Chauhan as Rashmi * Arya Banerjee as Naina * Herry Tangri as Loki Local * Amit Sial as Prabhat * Atul Mongia as Atul * Ashish Sharma as Shahid * Taran Bajaj as Goldie * Aaditi Pohankar  Production   Development  Director Dibakar Banerjee said several real-life sex scandals, including the DPS MMS scandal, inspired him to make the film because he \\"wanted to do something on what led to that incident\\". He co-wrote two short stories with Kanu Behl, which they later expanded into three. According to Banerjee, he found some sex tapes \\"hilarious\\" because \\"those people, while having sex were also struggling with the camera, the ergonomics of how to shoot while having sex\\". He wrote a two- page story about a man who is in love and \\"the contrast between what he thinks love should be and what it actually is\\". The film consisted of three stories dealt with issues of honour killings, sexual exploitation and voyeurism. The second story is based on diploma film footage that Banerjee had retrieved. He said the three stories were connected; \\"the way we played with time, and cause and effect and the fundamental rule that every story has a beginning, a middle and an end\\". Banerjee approached Ekta Kapoor after they finished writing the script; he said Kapoor \\"readily agreed\\" to produce it. In 2010, Kapoor launched ALT Entertainment and decided to release Love Sex Aur Dhokha under her banner. The film was jointly produced by Balaji Motion Pictures's ALT Entertainment and Priya Sreedharan. In June 2009, it was announced that Banerjee would make an experimental film about the impact of digital technology for Kapoor's company. Banerjee said, \\"Earlier, we would have sex because we wanted to have sex. Today, we have sex to get caught on a tape, to further their career or to make friends. That is the issue that the film is examining.\\" Banerjee stated that he wanted to examine \\"voyeurism\\", which \\"the whole society finds itself trapped in\\", through the film. Banerjee was inspired by the Tehelka sting operations for the third story of his film, which is about a sting operation on a pop star. According to him, several clich√©d dialogues of Hindi cinema were used in the film to show a \\"mirror\\" because the \\"trajectory is very similar to a typical Bollywood film and yet very different\\".  Casting  Banerjee and his team decided to cast newcomers and unknown professional actors. The cast consisted of actors including Neha Chauhan, Rajkummar Rao, Anshuman Jha, Nushrat Bharucha and Amit Sial. The casting director of the film was Atul Mongia, who also acted in it. Neha Chauhan was cast after Banerjee saw her in her brother's wedding video; Chauhan wanted to assist Banerjee but he chose her for the role of Rashmi. Mongia auditioned 15 people a day for three and a half months to cast the 75 characters in the film. He screened almost 2,000 actors and auditioned 1,000 of them; some actors were chosen from the street. Sandeep Bose, who runs a casting agency, sent actors for auditions and was eventually cast in the role of Shruti's father in the first story. The three actors who were shortlisted for lead characters underwent through a two-month workshop in Prithvi Theatre. They were asked to act out random situations and improvise scenes. Arya Banerjee, daughter of sitar player Nikhil Banerjee, was cast in the role of model Naina. Herry Tangri was cast in the role of pop star Loki local. Rajkummar Rao, an alumnus of Film and Television Institute of India, was cast as Adarsh; to resemble his character's physique he had to lose in a month. The film was edited by Namrata Rao, who also acted in a small role.  Filming  Love Sex aur Dhokha is an Indian film to be shot in the digital format. It was made using guerrilla film-making techniques in locations in Mumbai by the director of photography Nikos Andritsakis. It was filmed with different cameras, including a handycam, an amateur film camera, night-vision cameras, a security camera, an underwater camera and a spy camera. The stories are told from the camera's point of view; Banerjee said, \\"It is almost as if the camera is a character and to do that you have to give the camera character\\". The film was made with different kinds of camera. Banerjee said he chose to work digitally to get the aesthetics that he could not get on 35 mm film. An item song titled \\"I Can't Hold It\\" was purposely filmed poorly because in the film, the song is being shot by an amateur film director who makes mistakes. Banerjee said many takes were required for the five-second shot in which a woman jumps into the sea because \\"the camera jumped along with her, filming her movements\\". Andritsakis wanted to give the film a \\"video look\\" that has a \\"harsh\\" picture quality with everything in the frame in focus. Banerjee wanted the film to look \\"shaky, low-tech, fuzzy and unframed\\", and yet make it entertaining. He showed 1 Night in Paris to Andritsakis for reference. The underwater sequences set in a canal were filmed separately in a swimming pool with special gears for the camera. The suicide scene was filmed using a stunt double and the camera free-flowing in air; the actors performed their parts of the scene separately using chroma key.  Soundtrack  The film's soundtrack album was composed by Sneha Khanwalkar and the lyrics were written by Dibakar Banerjee. The album rights were acquired by Sony Music and the soundtrack album was released on 8 March 2010. Vocals were performed by Khanwalkar, Kailash Kher, Nihira Joshi, Amey Date and Nagarjuna. Khanwalker was hired before the script was ready. Harmeet Singh of The Indian Express called the album a \\"pure delight\\" with a \\"rustic-club feel to it\\". The song \\"I Can't Hold It\\" has a blend of Rajasthani folk music with dholaks playing in the background. Sampurna Wire wrote: \\"Overall, though Love Sex Aur Dhokha doesn't cover a distance similar to that of Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye!, it has a much bigger single in the form of the title track \\"Love Sex Aur Dhokha\\" which makes all the difference\\".  Release  A 90-second trailer was to be released along with 3 Idiots in theatres across India; it was edited three times so it could be shown in 290 multiplex screens. The film was promoted with the tagline, \\"You're being watched\\". A promotional video of the film's title song was launched prior to the release. It was screened at the 2010 London Indian Film Festival and the Munich International Film festival. The Central Board of Film Certification shortened and blurred a love scene showing a bare-backed woman on top of a man. Banerjee showed his disappointment and said: \\"Those who saw the complete sex scene with the naked body were traumatised. There was nothing sexual about it\\". A reference to caste in the love story between a low-caste man and a high-caste woman was also changed; Banerjee stated his disappointment, saying, \\"This completely changes the perspective of my story since now the caste-challenged love story is turned into a poor-boy-rich-girl romance\\". The lyrics of the track \\"Tu Nangi Achi Lagti Hai\\" were changed to \\"Tu Gandi Achi Lagti Hai\\" in the film. Love Sex Aur Dhokha received an \\"A (adult only)\\" certificate after the changes. Kapoor was in a \\"state of shock\\" after seeing the final cut of the film because the shaky camerawork and the stories affected her deeply. Before the film's release, Banerjee screened the first 20 minutes of it in the SIES Nerul college and discussed it with the students. The film was released in 350 screens in India. It was only released in India because the producers felt the recovery of costs for small-budget films is not possible overseas. After the film's release, the producers decided to release it in selected screens in the US, UK, UAE and some other international markets. A photograph showing the bare backs of two actors from the film was released before the film; some media outlets labelled it \\"the most shocking scene to be ever filmed in a commercial Hindi film\\". Banerjee reacted to this and said, \\"I want the scene to be judged as part of the film. To use the picture out of context will be damaging to the film.\\" The film is also available on Netflix.  Reception   Critical reception  Banerjee's direction was praised by critics Love Sex Aur Dhokha opened to mostly positive responses from critics. Rajeev Masand gave it 4 out of 5, stating it as \\"the most riveting Hindi film in recent memory\\" and called it \\"possibly the most important Hindi film since Satya and Dil Chahta Hai.\\" Raja Sen called the film a \\"masterpiece\\", writing, \\"Bollywood has just grown up the only way it could, with Love, Sex and Dhokha.\\" Sarita Tanwar of Mid Day called it \\"season's best film\\" and a \\"must-watch\\". A review carried by The Indian Express called the film \\"path-breaking\\" which \\"signifies the changing face of Hindi cinema\\". Anupama Chopra called the film \\"a grim, deeply unsettling and yet compelling portrait of urban India\\" and a \\"polarizing film\\". Sanjukta Sharma of Mint gave a positive review and said, \\"LSD is raw and courageous; it is not pretty, but it has beauty ...\\". A review in The Times of India gave three-and-a-half to the film and stated, \\"Don't expect time-pass entertainment. Think beyond run-of-the-mill and see how Ekta Kapoor re-invents herself as the producer of contemporary Indian cinema's first full-blown experimental film\\". Mayank Shekhar stated, \\"Where any Bollywood movie without a gyrating, lip-synching hero perceives itself as 'different', this one ... is truly an experiment\\". Namrata Joshi called the film \\"remarkable\\" for the way it creates an \\"audacious narrative\\". Baradwaj Rangan wrote, \\"Love Sex Aur Dhokha is nothing if not off-the-charts ambitious‚Äîand yet, I couldn't shake off the feeling that Banerjee has pulled off a successful experiment rather than a satisfying experience\\". Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis said the writing of the film was \\"inconsistent\\" and called it \\"bold but not so beautiful\\". Subhash K. Jha said. \\"the director vision is so unified to the way the characters see themselves that a section of the audience may feel it's watching a hugely self-indulgent work that wants to keep the 'cinema' out of cinema\\". Ajit Duara of OPEN compared the film's title and filming techniques with Steven Soderbergh's Sex, Lies, and Videotape and felt unlike Soderbergh's film, Banerjee's film doesnot show his point of view. The film was mentioned in critic and author Shubhra Gupta's book, 50 Films That Changed Bollywood, 1995‚Äì2015.  Box office  Love Sex Aur Dhokha was made on a production budget of .

Due to the incorrect fuse arming in relation to the height of attack, the bomb explosions of Griff‚Äôs aircraft and that of Lieutenantt Thurstan RN damaged the tails of both planes, and they crashed into the sea with the loss of each air observer. Griff and Thurstan were the first naval officers captured in the war. At the time of their capture, the prisoner of war camp infrastructure was only just developing; those in captivity found their conditions relatively relaxed. Griff was placed in a number of POW camps ‚Äì including Spangenburg Castle (Oflag IX-A/H) and Dulag luft ‚Äì before incarceration in Stalag Luft III. Stalag Luft III achieved worldwide notoriety thanks to The Great Escape released in 1963. During Griff‚Äôs time in captivity there, he put his considerable artistic skills to good use. He was a forger, producing fake documents as required, and he also produced detailed paintings of aeroplanes based on aspects of those in current production, to provide misinformation to the enemy in order to buy time. Griff was also in contact with MI9 (British Military Intelligence Section 9) ‚Äì his letters to the Globe & Laurel (the Royal Marines Corps‚Äô publication) contained encrypted details for MI9 of identities of personnel in the camp. Griff spent the remainder of the war in Stalag Luft III. In 1945 he led the captives of his camp out to the Americans after being mistaken by Germans as being a Hungarian officer. Post-war Following the war, Griff underwent significant re-training to fly the latest aircraft. Once flying again, he served aboard . During the Korean War, he was instrumental in providing the first visual confirmation of a downed MiG 15 jet, which led to the first capture of this type by the west. In later years, from 1953 to 1958, Griff became the Editor of the Globe & Laurel publication. He also ran the Bolero coffee shop in Chichester (West Sussex, England). Between 1969 and 1980, he was domestic superintendent for the Royal West Sussex Hospital, and subsequently the whole Chichester district. Griff died from a heart attack on 12 July 1999 aged 84. The complete collection of watercolours and drawings he completed during his service career were subsequently bequeathed to the Royal Marines Museum. Publications *Reece, Michael, 2012.

In the case of a regular 9-sided base, one usually considers the case where its copy is twisted by an angle 180¬∞/n.

It comprises the major organisations in the field of brain research and brain disorders in Europe, and thus its structure involves a vast network of patients, scientists and doctors, working in partnership with the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries. The EBC's comprehensive scope makes it suited to working closely with major decision making bodies such as the European Commission, the European Parliament and the World Health Organization. Mission The European Brain Council promotes brain-related research by collaborating with member organisations, interacting with the Institutions of the European Union, fostering dialogue between scientists and society, promoting education and disseminating information about brain research and diseases in Europe. In April 2008, the EBC launched its Brain Mission, which is dedicated to understanding the brain, finding treatments for its diseases, and reducing the burden that brain disorders impose on healthcare costs. Projects The European Brain Council has been involved in many projects ever since its creation. Its membership results from concerted discussions with its members organisations. In addition, members of project groups are appointed by the EBC leadership in order to find the best- suited experts throughout Europe be they doctors, basic scientists or expert patients. EBRA Coordinated by EBC, EBRA enhances coordination and collaboration among members that share the common goal of understanding the brain and its disorders by synergising brain-related projects and initiatives at both European and global level, addressing gaps, supporting data sharing and access, and enabling the translation of research breakthroughs into innovations and health interventions, with the final aim to achieve critical mass and economies of scalehttps://www.ebra.eu/about/. The highly diversified nature of European public research, defined as an area of ‚Äúshared‚Äù policy responsibility between individual countries and the Commission, represents a considerable obstacle in the European Research Area. In this context, EBRA was created as a catalysing platform for the brain research stakeholders (researchers, clinicians, patients, governments, funders and public institutions) to streamline and better co-ordinate brain research across Europe while fostering global initiatives. The project began on 1 November 2018. MULTI-ACT The EU-funded MULTI-ACT project aims to increase the impact of health research on people with brain diseases. It will create and implement a new model allowing for the effective cooperation of all relevant stakeholders. This will be applicable in defining the scope of health research as well as new metrics for the evaluation of its results. The MULTI-ACT project will work with patient associations, academics, private stakeholders and the public to develop brand new tools to assess the value of research. It will be assessed from four different aspects: stakeholder agenda, scientific excellence, economic efficiency and social impact. The project kicked off in May 2018. Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease (AD) Detect & Prevent (ADDP) The EU-funded AD Detect- Prevent project, which is led by the Danish company Brain+, kicked-off in late 2018 and will continue over the next two years with the aim of developing a digital tool to improve early detection of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) and combining this with lifestyle programs for reducing lifestyle risk related to Alzheimer‚Äôs dementia. To achieve this, the project brings together a diverse group of partners with strong expertise in brain health, dementia, clinical neuroscience and patient advocacy. ASCTN-Training ASCTN-Training is a four- year project, funded by the European Union Horizon 2020 Programme (H2020-MSCA- ITN-2018) under the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Initial Training Network and Grant Agreement No. 813851. ASCTN-Training is addressing existing gaps within Human Stem Cell-based Neuronal disorders (NDs) Modelling (NDM) for research to develop new medicines for the treatment of neurological disorders (e.g. Parkinson‚Äôs (PD), Huntington‚Äôs (HD) and Demyelination‚Äôs (DM) diseases), which occur as a result of acute or progressive loss of cells, glial or neuronal, and structures and function in the brain. PRIME PRIME is an EU-funded project (H2020-EU.3.1.1. ‚Äì Understanding health, wellbeing and disease) and states that insulin signalling not only affects the body (e.g., diabetes and obesity) but also the brain (e.g., Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, autism and obsessive-compulsive disorders). The multidisciplinary PRIME consortium aims to better understand this body-brain co-morbidity and will bring this acquired knowledge to society (e.g., medication, lifestyle interventions, medical guidelines and policy). Furthermore, educational approaches to inform clinicians, patients, and general public will be developed. The project kicked off in January 2020 and will last 5 years. Membership The membership of the European Brain Council consists of professional organisations, patient organisations and industrial partners.

The six or seven species of the genus belong to a southern, possibly Gondwana element. General characteristics Jensenia liverworts are dioicous. Compared to Pallavicinia liverworts, their thallus grows erect, and branches tree-like, rather than trailing the ground. The thallus is perched on an ascending stipe which grows from a creeping rhizome. Slime papillae are absent from the thallus margin, though locally present elsewhere. The midrib of the thallus is broad but ill- defined. Reproductive morphology Male reproductive organs are scattered over the thallus's dorsal surface, while female organs are specifically placed near a bifurcation of the frond. The pseudoperianth, a tube of thallus tissue protecting the archegonia, is basally fused with the calyptra. Following fertilization, the sporophyte is enveloped by three structures: the cup-shaped involucre, cylindrical pseudoperianth and the calyptra. The spore surfaces are irregularly fasciated.

This railway line is part of the Line 1 of Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T). It is considered a \\"fundamental\\" line by the state railways Ferrovie dello Stato (FS). History The railway line was designed under the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the mid-19th century to ensure rapid and safe transport between Tyrol and northern Italy, especially Lombardy‚ÄìVenetia. It was thus strategically important not only for economic but also for military reasons, as Austria was strongly committed to maintaining its borders south of the Alps. The first section to be built was the lower section between Verona and Bolzano/Bozen. The design of this section was approved on 10 July 1853 by the engineer Alois Negrelli, an employee of the S√ºdbahn, known for having built other Alpine railway lines and for developing a project of the Suez Canal. The section was opened in two different parts: on 23 March 1859 between Verona to Trento/Trient and 16 May 1859 from Trento/Trient to Bolzano/Bozen. This construction was handled by the k.k. Nord- und S√ºdTiroler Staatsbahn (German: \\"North and South Tyrol State Railways\\"), but the company was taken over by the new Austrian Southern Railway (German: S√ºdbahn) at the beginning of 1859. Despite the loss of Veneto in the Third Italian War of Independence and its consequent shift of the border between Italy and Austria to Borghetto on the current boundary of Trentino and Verona in October 1866, the upper section from Bolzano/Bozen to Innsbruck was incomplete. The route from Innsbruck to Bolzano/Bozen took only three years to build. This section had been under construction and was finally opened on 24 August 1867. The main designer and engineer, Karl von Etzel, died in 1865; he was not able to witness the completion of his work. After the Semmering railway, this Brenner Line was the second mountain railway built within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It was also the first through line to cross over the Alps. The section south of Borghetto became part of the Societ√† per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (Italian for Upper (Northern) Italian Railways, SFAI) in 1866. In the 1885 reorganisation it was absorbed by the Societ√† per le Strade Ferrate Meridionali (Adriatic Network). The line came under the control of Ferrovie dello Stato upon its establishment in 1905. In 1919, Italy acquired Trentino-South Tyrol under the Treaty of Saint-Germain- en-Laye and the Austro-Italian border moved to Brenner. The section from Trento/Trient to Brenner was subsequently electrified at 3,700 V at three- phase 16.7 Hz between 1929 and 1934. Electrification was converted to 3,000 V DC on 30 May 1965. In preparation for the proposed Brenner Base Tunnel, the Innsbruck bypass was completed in 1994 to improve access to the Lower Inn Valley railway. The bypass consists of a tunnel (Austria's longest) and aims to remove the bulk of the freight train traffic from Innsbruck. In Italy, several new sections have been built, removing sections of line with several short tunnels with small cross sections. These include the Sciliar tunnel opened in 1994, the Pflersch tunnel opened in 1999 and the Cardano tunnel opened in 1998. Future Following a sharp increase in freight traffic through the Brenner Pass (largely on road), the railway is currently considered to have insufficient capacity. Moreover, its steep grades, tight radius bends and the need to change locomotive engines at Brenner due to two different electrical systems as used in Austria and Italy mean that the average travel speed is low. For these reasons, the creation of a new line is planned from Verona to Munich via Innsbruck. At the heart of this project lies a tunnel between Franzensfeste and Innsbruck, known as the Brenner Base Tunnel. Route The maximum grade on the track is 31 per thousand. The minimum curve radius is . The highest point of the track is Brenner station at , which is also the highest point reached on the standard gauge networks of the Austrian Federal Railways (√ñBB) and the Italian Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) networks. To overcome the steep climb ( between Innsbruck and Brenner) two spiral tunnels were built, using the sides of a valley at St. Jodok on the Austrian side and the sides of the Pflerschtal (German for \\"Pflersch Valley\\") on the Italian side. At Brenner station, located on the Brenner Pass (), there is a monument to the designer, Karl von Etzel. This station is situated at the border between Italy and Austria and also the operational border between the √ñBB and FS networks. The two companies operate different electrical systems, (15,000 V AC at 16.7 Hz in Austria, and 3,000 V DC in Italy), which requires a stop to change electric locomotives. For this reason, for a long time the operation of express trains from Munich to Verona and Milan was carried out with diesel railcars. Until 30 May 1965 was also needed a second engine change in Bolzano station, as the Bolzano‚ÄìBrenner section still operated under three- phase AC electrification. In recent years the introduction of multicurrent rolling stock, which can be run on both the Austrian and Italian networks, has made it possible, at least in principle, to avoid locomotive changes. However, the need for locomotives to carry equipment for different signalling systems and to have safety approvals for different networks and lines, and the need for staff to know operating rules and routes has limited multicurrent operations in practice.

The Sisters quickly established communities throughout Normandy and the neighbouring regions of France and Belgium. Expansion The anti-clerical laws passed in France in 1880 and again in 1904 led the Sisters to establish new foundations outside of the French- speaking world. They established a community in Hampshire in the United Kingdom in 1889, and one in West Virginia in the United States, in 1905. They later opened a number of communities in Massachusetts, where they served the children of French-Canadian immigrants. They formerly ran two private secondary schools for girls in Massachusetts: Marycliff Academy in Arlington, then Winchester; and Jeanne D'Arc Academy in Milton, MA.

In 1910, the school was moved to the former Victoria Inn on Victoria Road in Asheville and renamed St. Genevieve-of-the-Pines. Classes at the new campus started in January 1911. Initially, it was both a day school for boys and girls aged 6‚Äì13, and a boarding school for girls aged 14‚Äì18. St. Genevieve's College was added in 1912, offering a two-year course in French as well as a four-year liberal arts curriculum. In 1930, the school developed into a two-year college named St. Genevieve's Junior College, which operated until 1955, when it became the School for Secretaries. The boys from the day school moved into a separate building in 1949, which became the Gibbons Hall School for Boys. At its height, the campus covered over 35 acres. The Religious of Christian Education ceased operating the schools in 1971 due to a shortage of vocations and the age and poor health of the Sisters. With the help of parents, the two schools merged to form St. Genevieve/Gibbons Hall School, an independent day school for both boys and girls, offering classes from kindergarten through the ninth grade, with some of the Sisters remaining as teachers. To combat rising costs and declining enrollments at both schools, the school merged in 1987 with the Asheville Country Day School, at which time the Sisters withdrew from it. The St. Genevieve campus was sold to the Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College, and a new school, the Carolina Day School, was established on the Asheville Country Day School campus.

Geography  The castle stands on the side of the Canal de Nantes √† Brest. It has 12 towers and covers an area of 4 hectares.  History  Tour du Sud-Ouest, Tour du Pont-Levis and Tour des prisons The first castle was constructed by order of Alan IV, Duke of Brittany, around 1108. The fortress passed by marriage to the Clisson family in 1225. Following Olivier Ier de Clisson's revolt against the Duke, the castle was razed in 1260. Olivier I's son, Olivier II obtained permission from the Duke to rebuild the castle. The Clissons progressively enlarged the castle during the 14th century. In 1407, the castle became the property of the House of Rohan. Louis, duc de Rohan is buried here. During the French Wars of Religion, the castle was besieged and set on fire in 1591 during the fighting between the Duke of Merc≈ìur and Jean de Montauban, the knight De Goust. It was restored by Catherine de Parthenay, who installed herself there with her children. In 1628, Henri II de Rohan having become the leader of the Protestant princes, Cardinal Richelieu ordered the dismantling of the castle which thus lost its military role.Le guide vert bretagne, Michelin (2000), The castle suffered further serious damage during the French Revolution. It was pillaged and burnt, along with the Rohan family archives. It served as a barracks and later as a prison. It passed through the hands of several proprietors, including Marie Bonaparte in 1918. These owners remodelled the north wing (known as the Logis du Roy) and the Mill Tower (la tour du moulin).  Architecture  North wing of Ch√¢teau de Blain, the Logis du Roy, remodelled in the 19th century The South West Tower and the Drawbridge Tower with the buildings on either side form the entrance to the castle. Along with the Constable's Tower (tour du Conn√©table), the two towers in the south east and the monumental entrance on the south facade of the logis du Roi, they date from before the 17th century. Together with the remains of the towers and the fortifications linking them, these have been classified as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. The north wing of the logis du Roi was remodelled in the 19th century.  Today  The castle houses a fresco centre and an ancient printshop. It has been listed since 1977 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.

History The barracks were established, on the site of the former RAF Bramcote airbase, in 1959: it was called after HMS Gamecock, the name of the naval unit based at the site before the British Army took it over. The Barracks were home to the Junior Leaders' Regiment Royal Artillery, between the 1960s and the 1990s. This was an Army training establishment for the future non-commissioned officers of the Royal Artillery. It was one of many different types of Junior establishments for soldiers serving from the age of 15 to 17 years (until the school leaving age was raised to 16). After completing their military and trade training, which initially took two years, but was latterly reduced to 12 months, they would muster to their designated Regular Army Artillery Regiments. Current Use Since 1993 the barracks have been occupied by 30 Signal Regiment. Future Use In November 2016, following a review of the defence infrastructure, it was announced that (by 2021) Gamecock Barracks would additionally be home to the following units: * 170 (Infrastructure Support) Engineer Group, Royal Engineers - relocating from Chetwynd Barracks, Chilwell * HQ 2 Medical Brigade - relocating from Queen Elizabeth Barracks, Strensall * 34 Field Hospital * Medical Training Facility Together with Whittington Barracks this would form a West Midlands-based Defence Medical Services centre of excellence.

Four of the band members are brothers: Ganbayar, T√∂m√∂rtsog, Otgonbayar and Otgonbaatar are sons of Damba (see Mongolian name). All the members were born and raised in the railway district in Ulan Bator.  Dambyn Ganbayar  Dambyn Ganbayar or –î–∞–º–±—ã–Ω –ì–∞–Ω–±–∞—è—Ä (born 6 June 1963) is Hurd's founding member, manager and instrumentalist. Ganbayar is the oldest member in the band and he has re-formed the second line-up of Hurd with lead guitarist D.Otgonbayar and bassist N.Naranbaatar starting from 1991. Although not officially carrying the title, he fulfills the managers and producers duties. Ganbayar's interest in foreign heavy metal music dates back to 1975. Among his favourite bands are Metallica, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, WASP. As a child, Ganbayar has played guitar, then drums in Gan Zam (, \\"railway\\"), and later drums in Enkhiin tug (, \\"flag of peace\\"). He continued playing in bands during his student years in Donetsk, Ukraine. Ganbayar is a complete musician, capable of playing a wide variety of instruments. Originally he was Hurd's drummer, until the arrival of his younger brother Otgonbaatar in 1997. He often accompanies Hurd on a Korg Triton music workstation or percussion instruments. In Unplugged II, he is seen playing mandolin, melodica or harmonica. Since the departure of T.Naranbaatar in late 2008, Ganbayar has also been playing rhythm guitar, most of the time an Ovation Balladeer 6751 twelve-string acoustic. Ganbayar has composed at least 10 songs for Hurd, most famous ones being Chono, Ekh oron, Minii Mongol or Ochij chadaagui. In 1999, Ganbayar won the \\"Best Musician\\" award at the Pentatonic Awards.  Dambyn T√∂m√∂rtsog  Dambyn T√∂m√∂rtsog or –î–∞–º–±—ã–Ω –¢”©–º”©—Ä—Ü–æ–≥ (born 18 June 1969) is Hurd's lead vocalist since 1993. T√∂m√∂rtsog loved music since he was little. He was nine years old when he began playing guitar, and today he is also capable of playing piano and drums. According to T√∂m√∂rtsog, when in school, he was a \\"real trouble maker\\" and regularly got detention. Before joining Hurd, he was a herder, finished his military service and sold milk in Ulan Bator. T√∂m√∂rtsog is known for his powerful voice, capable of reaching very high notes. In his student years, he used to sing during the school-organized events. Today, he makes regular vocal exercises on a piano to keep his voice in good shape. More intensive rehearsals start about a month before a show takes place. T√∂m√∂rtsog has won the Merited Artist of Mongolia award in 2009 and a number of Pentatonic awards. T√∂m√∂rtsog has one song to his credit, having written the music and the lyrics of the power ballad Chamaig zorino. Although the song was written very early on, it wasn't released on any of Hurd's studio albums before Khairyn Salkhi. Live versions are available on Unplugged and Talarkhalyn Kontsert. T√∂m√∂rtsog uses Shure wireless microphones for his on stage performances.  Dambyn Otgonbayar  Dambyn Otgonbayar or –î–∞–º–±—ã–Ω –û—Ç–≥–æ–Ω–±–∞—è—Ä (born 28 December 1973) is Hurd's lead guitarist since 1991. Otgonbayar joined Hurd right after finishing secondary school in 1991. Otgonbayar is a Metallica fan and his musical style is much influenced by their music. Slash, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and Ts.Enkhmanlai from Haranga are among his favorite guitarists. Otgonbayar composed his first song for Hurd in 1993, a power ballad named Chimeeg√ºi irekh durlal, later released on The Best Collection I. Being one of the most famous of Hurd's songs, it is played live at virtually every Hurd concert. To this day, Otgonbayar has written more than half of Hurd's music, with over 50 songs to his credit. Otgonbayar uses mainly a Fender Stratocaster or an ESP EXP for recording sessions, as well as live performances. He is also known to possess a Gibson EDS-1275 double neck guitar. His acoustic guitars are of Taylor brand. Other equipment includes: * Marshall amplifiers * Korg ToneWorks AX3000G modeling signal processor * Line 6 POD amp modeler * Shure wireless receiver * D'Addario strings * Dunlop picks  Bi Bol  In 2003, Otgonbayar released a solo album titled Bi Bol (, \\"I am\\"), containing mainly instrumental songs written between 1995 and 2003. Some of them are instrumental reprises of Hurd songs, while others are previously unreleased recordings. A notable exception is √ñd√∂r sh√∂n√∂, which is just a remastered version of the same track from the 1999 album of the same name, with Dambyn T√∂m√∂rtsog's original vocals. Track listing The album, as well as two other Otgonbayar solo albums, were released on iTunes in 2012.https://itunes.apple.com/au/artist/otgonbayar/id540262848  Namsraijavyn Naranbaatar  Namsraijavyn Naranbaatar or –ù–∞–º—Å—Ä–∞–π–∂–∞–≤—ã–Ω –ù–∞—Ä–∞–Ω–±–∞–∞—Ç–∞—Ä (born 24 July 1974) is one of Hurd's founding members and has been their bassist since 1992. Naranbaatar grew up listening to speed metal bands of the 80's. He is primarily a fingerstyle player, but has been known to play with a pick sometimes. Naranbaatar is also the band's backing vocalist and studio engineer. He co-wrote with S.Ishkh√º√º the music to one of Hurd's most famous songs, Eejdee. In November 2009, Naranbaatar was awarded the Polar Star award for outstanding achievement. Naranbaatar's main instruments is a Music Man StingRay. For acoustic sets, he uses a Taylor AB1 acoustic bass.

The Council then called on all States to respect free navigation in international waters in accordance with international law, calling for respect for the territorial integrity for States that were not part of the conflict between Iran and Iraq. The resolution demanded Iran cease the attacks on the commercial ships to and from the ports of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

It also requested the Secretary-General Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar to report on the progress of the implementation of Resolution 552. The resolution was adopted by 13 votes to none, with two abstentions from Nicaragua and Zimbabwe.

The design with the two knights on a horse and the inscription SIGILLVM MILITVM XRISTI is attested in 1191; see Jochen Burgtorf, The central convent of Hospitallers and Templars: history, organization, and personnel (1099/1120-1310), Volume 50 of History of warfare (2008), , pp. 545‚Äì546. The Temple of Solomon was anachronistically depicted as the Dome of the Rock in Western iconography well into the early modern period (here in a print by Salvatore & Giandomenico Marescandoli of Lucca, 1600) The Templum Domini (Vulgate translation of Hebrew: \\"Temple of the Lord\\") was the name attributed by the Crusaders to the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. It became an important symbol of Jerusalem, depicted on coins minted under the Christian Kingdom of Jerusalem. The Dome of the Rock was erected in the late 7th century under the 5th Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan at the site of the former Jewish Second Temple (or possibly added to an existing Byzantine building dating to the reign of Heraclius, 610‚Äì641).H.

After the capture of Jerusalem in the First Crusade (1099), the Dome of the Rock was given into the care of Augustinian Canons Regular, who turned it into a Christian church. The adjacent Al-Aqsa Mosque was called Templum Solomonis (\\"Temple of Solomon\\") by the Crusaders. It first became a royal palace. The image of the Dome, as representing the \\"Temple of Solomon\\", became an important iconographic element in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The royal seals of the Kings of Jerusalem depicted the city symbolically by combining the Tower of David, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Dome of the Rock and the city walls. After the completion of the purpose-built royal palace near the Jaffa Gate, the King of Jerusalem gave the building to the Knights Templar, who maintained it as their headquarters. The Dome was indicated on the reverse of the seals of the Grand Masters of the Knights Templar (such as Everard des Barres and Renaud de Vichiers), and it became the architectural model for round Templar churches across Europe.The Architecture of the Italian Renaissance, Jacob Burckhardt, Peter Murray, James C. Palmes, University of Chicago Press, 1986, p. 81 Although the adjacent Dome of the Ascension was constructed as a baptistry during the Crusader period, it has since remained in the hands of Islamic authorities as part of the larger complex of the Dome of the Rock.Simon Sebag Montefiore, Jerusalem: The Biography, p. 276.

For each food item, it sketches the primary commodity availability for human consumption i.e. the sources of supply and its utilization in terms of nutrient value. A food balance sheet is a comprehensive compilation of a selected country's food supply during a specific time period. The food balance sheet shows the food items for human consumption, along with how it is produced, used, imported/exported, and how it benefits the society (per capita supply). The total quantity produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilization side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content. The food balance sheet covers production, trade, feed and seed, waste, other utilization, availability, quantities, calories, proteins, and fats. By combining these elements, one is able to detect the food security of a country, how reliant it is on imported crops/foodstuffs, and how it attributes to world exports. According to Margaret Buchanan-Smith of the tatti Overseas Development Institute, London, the food balance sheet is the most traditional and widely used method of translating \\"early warning data into food aid requirements.\\"Margaret Buchanan- Smith (2000) Role of Early Warning Systems in the Decision-Making Process Overseas Development Institute  East African Community Regional Food Balance Sheet  The EAC Regional Food Balance has been developed by the EAC Secretariat in collaboration with EAC Partner States (relevant public and private sector organizations). It is developed further to the provisions of the EAC Food Security Action Plan. The background behind its development is recognition of it being an important tool towards the regions efforts of managing the food security situation. In principle, the Regional Food Balance Sheet is expected to give accurate and reliable information about food availability in the current period. It is a departure from the known traditional food balance sheet which gave historical information. The RFBS is therefore a powerful tool for use by Governments in determining adequacy of food supplies for purposes managing food security concerns. Where the RFBS posts food surplus, the immediate impact is to release funds that the Government would have tied up in securing food not knowing that the region has sufficient food. It also encourages Governments to come up with proactive trade policy measures to encourage flow of food from countries which the RFBS reveal as having surplus. It therefore leads to actualization of the objectives of the EAC Customs Union of free flow of goods within the EAC region. The RFBS is a powerful tool for the private sector to use in planning exports and imports. First preference due to preferential duties is the EAC regional market, where the private sector has an advantage over other supplies coming from outside the EAC region. It enables the private sector to use the hedge of Common External Tariffs which is in favour of intra-EAC trade to exploit trade potential for the various products covered under the RFBS. The RFBS is also a tool that the private sector will use to engage Governments whenever there are reported short fall in supplies as revealed by RFBS, cannot meet. In such a case, the RFBS data will be used to lobby for temporary stay of application of Common External Tariff for the products facing regional shortages. The RFBS is a powerful tool for Relief Agencies to use in determining regional food security crisis and planning for relief supplies. It is also a useful tool for the Relief Agencies to use in sourcing food supplies from the region based on the revealed food availability. The scope of the comprehensive EAC Regional Food Balance Sheet has been informed by the EAC Food Security priority products that are covered under the following components a) Cereals and Pulses b) Livestock (Meat, Dairy Products and Animal Fats) c) Fisheries d) Horticulture (Fruits, Vegetables and Roots and Tubers) e) Industrial Crops (Sugar and Sugar Products, Oil Crops and Vegetable Oils) More information on the methodology can be found on http://www.rfbs.in  Country Example: Ivory Coast  In Ivory Coast, a developing country, food security is an issue. This is apparent under Ivory Coast's 2009 (the most recent statistics) food balance sheet. Cereals- including wheat, corn, rye, oats, etc.- are a large part of the Ivorian diet. 1,834,000 metric tons are imported, 1,167,000 metric tons are produced, while only 112,000 metric tons are exported. Cocoa production in Ivory Coast is the largest cocoa industry in the world, accounting for 30% of the World's production as of 2009. While producing 1,223,000 metric tons, Ivorians export 1,192,000 metric tons, making cocoa a major cash crop.

The Lebesgue integral extends the integral to a larger class of functions. It also extends the domains on which these functions can be defined. Long before the 20th century, mathematicians already understood that for non-negative functions with a smooth enough graph‚Äîsuch as continuous functions on closed bounded intervals‚Äîthe area under the curve could be defined as the integral, and computed using approximation techniques on the region by polygons. However, as the need to consider more irregular functions arose‚Äîe.g., as a result of the limiting processes of mathematical analysis and the mathematical theory of probability‚Äîit became clear that more careful approximation techniques were needed to define a suitable integral. Also, one might wish to integrate on spaces more general than the real line. The Lebesgue integral provides abstractions needed to do this important job. The Lebesgue integral plays an important role in probability theory, real analysis, and many other fields in mathematics. It is named after Henri Lebesgue (1875‚Äì1941), who introduced the integral . It is also a pivotal part of the axiomatic theory of probability. The term Lebesgue integration can mean either the general theory of integration of a function with respect to a general measure, as introduced by Lebesgue, or the specific case of integration of a function defined on a sub-domain of the real line with respect to the Lebesgue measure.  Introduction  The integral of a positive function between limits and can be interpreted as the area under the graph of . This is easy to understand for familiar functions such as polynomials, but what does it mean for more exotic functions? In general, for which class of functions does \\"area under the curve\\" make sense? The answer to this question has great theoretical and practical importance. As part of a general movement toward rigor in mathematics in the nineteenth century, mathematicians attempted to put integral calculus on a firm foundation. The Riemann integral‚Äîproposed by Bernhard Riemann (1826‚Äì1866)‚Äîis a broadly successful attempt to provide such a foundation. Riemann's definition starts with the construction of a sequence of easily calculated areas that converge to the integral of a given function. This definition is successful in the sense that it gives the expected answer for many already-solved problems, and gives useful results for many other problems. However, Riemann integration does not interact well with taking limits of sequences of functions, making such limiting processes difficult to analyze. This is important, for instance, in the study of Fourier series, Fourier transforms, and other topics. The Lebesgue integral is better able to describe how and when it is possible to take limits under the integral sign (via the powerful monotone convergence theorem and dominated convergence theorem). While the Riemann integral considers the area under a curve as made out of vertical rectangles, the Lebesgue definition considers horizontal slabs that are not necessarily just rectangles, and so it is more flexible. For this reason, the Lebesgue definition makes it possible to calculate integrals for a broader class of functions. For example, the Dirichlet function, which is 0 where its argument is irrational and 1 otherwise, has a Lebesgue integral, but does not have a Riemann integral. Furthermore, the Lebesgue integral of this function is zero, which agrees with the intuition that when picking a real number uniformly at random from the unit interval, the probability of picking a rational number should be zero. Lebesgue summarized his approach to integration in a letter to Paul Montel: The insight is that one should be able to rearrange the values of a function freely, while preserving the value of the integral. This process of rearrangement can convert a very pathological function into one that is \\"nice\\" from the point of view of integration, and thus let such pathological functions be integrated.  Intuitive interpretation  Riemann-Darboux's integration (in blue) and Lebesgue integration (in red). To get some intuition about the different approaches to integration, let us imagine that we want to find a mountain's volume (above sea level). ;The Riemann‚ÄìDarboux approach: Divide the base of the mountain into a grid of 1 meter squares. Measure the altitude of the mountain at the center of each square. The volume on a single grid square is approximately 1 m2 √ó (that square's altitude), so the total volume is 1 m2 times the sum of the altitudes. ;The Lebesgue approach: Draw a contour map of the mountain, where adjacent contours are 1 meter of altitude apart. The volume of earth a single contour contains is approximately 1 m √ó (that contour's area), so the total volume is the sum of these areas times 1 m. Folland summarizes the difference between the Riemann and Lebesgue approaches thus: \\"to compute the Riemann integral of , one partitions the domain into subintervals\\", while in the Lebesgue integral, \\"one is in effect partitioning the range of .\\"  Towards a formal definition  thumb|right|A measurable function is shown, together with the set \\\\\\\\{x|f(x)>t\\\\\\\\} (on the x-axis). The Lebesgue integral is obtained by slicing along the y-axis, using the 1-dimensional Lebesgue measure to measure the \\"width\\" of the slices. To define the Lebesgue integral requires the formal notion of a measure that, roughly, associates to each set of real numbers a nonnegative number representing the \\"size\\" of . This notion of \\"size\\" should agree with the usual length of an interval or disjoint union of intervals. Suppose that is a non- negative real-valued function. Using the \\"partitioning the range of \\" philosophy, the integral of should be the sum over of the elementary area contained in the thin horizontal strip between . This elementary area is just :\\\\mu \\\\left (\\\\\\\\{x\\\\mid f(x)>t\\\\\\\\} \\\\right ) \\\\,dt. Let :f^*(t)=\\\\mu \\\\left (\\\\\\\\{x\\\\mid f(x)>t\\\\\\\\} \\\\right ). The Lebesgue integral of is then defined by :\\\\int f\\\\,d\\\\mu = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty f^*(t)\\\\,dt where the integral on the right is an ordinary improper Riemann integral. Note that is a non-negative decreasing function, and therefore has a well-defined improper Riemann integral with value in the interval . For a suitable class of functions (the measurable functions), this defines the Lebesgue integral. A general (not necessarily positive) measurable function is Lebesgue integrable if the area between the graph of and the -axis is finite: :\\\\int |f|\\\\,d\\\\mu < \\\\+ \\\\infty. In that case, as in the Riemannian case, the integral is the difference between the area above the -axis and the area below the -axis: :\\\\int f \\\\,d\\\\mu = \\\\int f^+ \\\\,d\\\\mu - \\\\int f^- \\\\,d\\\\mu where f=f^+ - f^- is the decomposition of f into the difference of two non-negative functions given by :\\\\begin{alignat}{3} f^+(x)&=\\\\max\\\\\\\\{f(x),0\\\\\\\\} &{}={}&\\\\begin{cases} f(x), & \\\\text{if } f(x) > 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases}\\\\\\\\\\\\ f^-(x)&=\\\\max\\\\\\\\{-f(x),0\\\\\\\\} &{}={}&\\\\begin{cases} -f(x), & \\\\text{if } f(x) < 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, & \\\\text{otherwise.} \\\\end{cases} \\\\end{alignat}  Construction  The theory of the Lebesgue integral requires a theory of measurable sets and measures on these sets, as well as a theory of measurable functions and integrals on these functions.  Measure theory  Measure theory was initially created to provide a useful abstraction of the notion of length of subsets of the real line‚Äîand, more generally, area and volume of subsets of Euclidean spaces. In particular, it provided a systematic answer to the question of which subsets of have a length. As later set theory developments showed (see non-measurable set), it is actually impossible to assign a length to all subsets of in a way that preserves some natural additivity and translation invariance properties. This suggests that picking out a suitable class of measurable subsets is an essential prerequisite. The Riemann integral uses the notion of length explicitly. Indeed, the element of calculation for the Riemann integral is the rectangle , whose area is calculated to be . The quantity is the length of the base of the rectangle and is the height of the rectangle. Riemann could only use planar rectangles to approximate the area under the curve, because there was no adequate theory for measuring more general sets. In the development of the theory in most modern textbooks (after 1950), the approach to measure and integration is axiomatic. This means that a measure is any function Œº defined on a certain class of subsets of a set , which satisfies a certain list of properties. These properties can be shown to hold in many different cases.  Measurable functions  We start with a measure space where is a set, is a œÉ-algebra of subsets of , and Œº is a (non-negative) measure on defined on the sets of . For example, can be Euclidean -space or some Lebesgue measurable subset of it, is the œÉ-algebra of all Lebesgue measurable subsets of , and Œº is the Lebesgue measure. In the mathematical theory of probability, we confine our study to a probability measure , which satisfies . Lebesgue's theory defines integrals for a class of functions called measurable functions. A real-valued function on is measurable if the pre-image of every interval of the form (in fact, any Borel set) is in : : \\\\\\\\{x\\\\,\\\\mid\\\\,f(x) > t\\\\\\\\} \\\\in X\\\\quad \\\\forall t\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}. We can show that this is equivalent to requiring that the pre-image of any Borel subset of ‚Ñù be in . The set of measurable functions is closed under algebraic operations, but more importantly it is closed under various kinds of point-wise sequential limits: : \\\\sup_{k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} f_k, \\\\quad \\\\liminf_{k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} f_k, \\\\quad \\\\limsup_{k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} f_k are measurable if the original sequence , where , consists of measurable functions. There are several approaches for defining an integral: : \\\\int_E f \\\\, d \\\\mu = \\\\int_E f\\\\left(x\\\\right)\\\\, d\\\\mu\\\\left(x\\\\right) for measurable real- valued functions defined on . Constructing the integral Approximating a function by simple functions. One approach to constructing the Lebesgue integral is to make use of so-called simple functions: finite real-linear combinations of indicator functions. For a measure theory novice, this construction of the Lebesgue integral makes more intuitive sense when it's compared to the way Riemann sum is used with the definition/construction of the Riemann integral. Simple functions can be used to approximate a measurable function, by partitioning the range into layers. The integral of a simple function is equal to the measure of a given layer, times the height of that layer. The integral of a non-negative general measurable function is then defined as an appropriate supremum of approximations by simple functions, and the integral of a (not necessarily positive) measurable function is the difference of two integrals of non-negative measurable functions, as mentioned earlier.  Indicator functions  To assign a value to the integral of the indicator function of a measurable set consistent with the given measure Œº, the only reasonable choice is to set: :\\\\int 1_S \\\\, d\\\\mu = \\\\mu (S). Notice that the result may be equal to , unless is a finite measure.  Simple functions  A finite linear combination of indicator functions :\\\\sum_k a_k 1_{S_k} where the coefficients are real numbers and are disjoint measurable sets, is called a measurable simple function. We extend the integral by linearity to non-negative measurable simple functions. When the coefficients are non-negative, we set :\\\\int \\\\left(\\\\sum_k a_k 1_{S_k}\\\\right) \\\\, d \\\\mu = \\\\sum_k a_k \\\\int 1_{S_k} \\\\, d \\\\mu = \\\\sum_k a_k \\\\, \\\\mu(S_k). The convention must be used, and the result may be infinite. Even if a simple function can be written in many ways as a linear combination of indicator functions, the integral is always the same. This can be shown using the additivity property of measures. Some care is needed when defining the integral of a real-valued simple function, to avoid the undefined expression : one assumes that the representation : f = \\\\sum_k a_k 1_{S_k} is such that whenever . Then the above formula for the integral of f makes sense, and the result does not depend upon the particular representation of satisfying the assumptions. If is a measurable subset of and is a measurable simple function one defines : \\\\int_B s \\\\, d\\\\mu = \\\\int 1_B \\\\, s \\\\, d\\\\mu = \\\\sum_k a_k \\\\, \\\\mu(S_k \\\\cap B).  Non- negative functions  Let be a non-negative measurable function on , which we allow to attain the value , in other words, takes non-negative values in the extended real number line. We define :\\\\int_E f \\\\, d\\\\mu = \\\\sup\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\,\\\\int_E s\\\\, d\\\\mu : 0 \\\\le s \\\\le f,\\\\ s\\\\ \\\\text{simple}\\\\,\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. We need to show this integral coincides with the preceding one, defined on the set of simple functions, when E is a segment [a, b]. There is also the question of whether this corresponds in any way to a Riemann notion of integration. It is possible to prove that the answer to both questions is yes. We have defined the integral of f for any non-negative extended real-valued measurable function on E. For some functions, this integral ‚à´E f dŒº is infinite. It is often useful to have a particular sequence of simple functions that approximates the Lebesgue integral well (analogously to a Riemann sum). For a non-negative measurable function , let s_n(x) be the simple function whose value is k/2^n whenever k/2^n\\\\le f(x)<(k+1)/2^n, for k a non-negative integer less than (say) 4^n. Then it can be proven directly that :\\\\int f\\\\,d\\\\mu = \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\int s_n\\\\,d\\\\mu and that the limit on the right hand side exists as an extended real number. This bridges the connection between the approach to the Lebesgue integral using simple functions, and the motivation for the Lebesgue integral using a partition of the range.  Signed functions  To handle signed functions, we need a few more definitions. If is a measurable function of the set to the reals (including ), then we can write : f = f^+ - f^-, \\\\quad where : f^+(x) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix} f(x) & \\\\text{if } f(x) > 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. : f^-(x) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix} -f(x) & \\\\text{if } f(x) < 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. Note that both and are non-negative measurable functions. Also note that : |f= f^+ + f^-. \\\\quad We say that the Lebesgue integral of the measurable function exists, or is defined if at least one of \\\\int f^+ \\\\, d\\\\mu and \\\\int f^- \\\\, d\\\\mu is finite: : \\\\min\\\\left(\\\\int f^+ \\\\, d \\\\mu, \\\\int f^- \\\\, d \\\\mu\\\\right) < \\\\infty. In this case we define : \\\\int f \\\\, d \\\\mu = \\\\int f^+ \\\\, d\\\\mu - \\\\int f^- \\\\, d\\\\mu. If : \\\\int |f\\\\, d \\\\mu < \\\\infty, we say that is Lebesgue integrable. It turns out that this definition gives the desirable properties of the integral.  Complex-valued functions  Complex-valued functions can be similarly integrated, by considering the real part and the imaginary part separately. If h=f+ig for real-valued integrable functions f, g, then the integral of h is defined by : \\\\int h \\\\, d \\\\mu = \\\\int f \\\\, d \\\\mu + i \\\\int g \\\\, d \\\\mu. The function is Lebesgue integrable if and only if its absolute value is Lebesgue integrable (see Absolutely integrable function).  Example  Consider the indicator function of the rational numbers, , also known as the Dirichlet function. This function is nowhere continuous. * 1_{\\\\mathbf Q} is not Riemann-integrable on : No matter how the set is partitioned into subintervals, each partition contains at least one rational and at least one irrational number, because rationals and irrationals are both dense in the reals. Thus the upper Darboux sums are all one, and the lower Darboux sums are all zero. * 1_{\\\\mathbf Q} is Lebesgue-integrable on using the Lebesgue measure: Indeed, it is the indicator function of the rationals so by definition :: \\\\int_{[0,1]} 1_{\\\\mathbf Q} \\\\, d \\\\mu = \\\\mu(\\\\mathbf{Q} \\\\cap [0,1]) = 0, :because is countable.  Domain of integration  A technical issue in Lebesgue integration is that the domain of integration is defined as a set (a subset of a measure space), with no notion of orientation. In elementary calculus, one defines integration with respect to an orientation: :\\\\int_b^a f := - \\\\int_a^b f. Generalizing this to higher dimensions yields integration of differential forms. By contrast, Lebesgue integration provides an alternative generalization, integrating over subsets with respect to a measure; this can be notated as :\\\\int_A f\\\\,d\\\\mu = \\\\int_{[a,b]} f\\\\,d\\\\mu to indicate integration over a subset . For details on the relation between these generalizations, see .  Limitations of the Riemann integral  With the advent of Fourier series, many analytical problems involving integrals came up whose satisfactory solution required interchanging limit processes and integral signs. However, the conditions under which the integrals : \\\\sum_k \\\\int f_k(x) dx, \\\\quad \\\\int \\\\left [\\\\sum_k f_k(x) \\\\right ] dx are equal proved quite elusive in the Riemann framework. There are some other technical difficulties with the Riemann integral. These are linked with the limit-taking difficulty discussed above. Failure of monotone convergence. As shown above, the indicator function on the rationals is not Riemann integrable. In particular, the Monotone convergence theorem fails. To see why, let } be an enumeration of all the rational numbers in (they are countable so this can be done.) Then let : g_k(x) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix} 1 & \\\\text{if } x = a_j, j\\\\leq k \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right. The function is zero everywhere, except on a finite set of points. Hence its Riemann integral is zero. Each is non- negative, and this sequence of functions is monotonically increasing, but its limit as is , which is not Riemann integrable. Unsuitability for unbounded intervals. The Riemann integral can only integrate functions on a bounded interval. It can however be extended to unbounded intervals by taking limits, so long as this doesn't yield an answer such as . Integrating on structures other than Euclidean space. The Riemann integral is inextricably linked to the order structure of the real line.  Basic theorems of the Lebesgue integral  Two functions are said to be equal almost everywhere (f\\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\text{a.e.}}{=}\\\\ g for short) if they coincide outside a subset of measure 0. Measurability of the subset \\\\\\\\{x \\\\mid f(x) eq g(x)\\\\\\\\} is not required. * If are non-negative measurable functions (possibly assuming the value ) such that almost everywhere, then : \\\\int f \\\\, d \\\\mu = \\\\int g \\\\, d \\\\mu. :To wit, the integral respects the equivalence relation of almost-everywhere equality. * If are functions such that almost everywhere, then is Lebesgue integrable if and only if is Lebesgue integrable, and the integrals of and are the same if they exist. * Linearity: If and are Lebesgue integrable functions and and are real numbers, then is Lebesgue integrable and : \\\\int (a f + bg) \\\\, d \\\\mu = a \\\\int f \\\\, d\\\\mu + b \\\\int g \\\\, d\\\\mu. * Monotonicity: If , then : \\\\int f \\\\, d \\\\mu \\\\leq \\\\int g \\\\, d \\\\mu. * Let (\\\\Omega,\\\\Sigma,\\\\mu) be a measure space. Denote \\\\operatorname{\\\\mathcal B}_{\\\\R_{\\\\geq 0}} the \\\\sigma-algebra of Borel sets on [0,+\\\\infty]. (By definition, \\\\operatorname{\\\\mathcal B}_{\\\\R_{\\\\geq 0}} contains the set \\\\\\\\{+\\\\infty\\\\\\\\} and all Borel subsets of \\\\R_{\\\\geq 0}). Consider a (\\\\Sigma,\\\\operatorname{\\\\mathcal B}_{\\\\R_{\\\\geq 0}})-measurable non- negative function s:\\\\Omega\\\\to [0,+\\\\infty]. For a set S\\\\in\\\\Sigma, define : u(S)=\\\\int_Ss\\\\,d\\\\mu. :Then u is a Lebesgue measure on (\\\\Omega,\\\\Sigma). * Monotone convergence theorem: Suppose is a sequence of non-negative measurable functions such that : f_k(x) \\\\leq f_{k+1}(x) \\\\quad \\\\forall k\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}, \\\\, \\\\forall x \\\\in E. :Then, the pointwise limit of is Lebesgue measurable and : \\\\lim_k \\\\int f_k \\\\, d\\\\mu = \\\\int f \\\\, d \\\\mu. :The value of any of the integrals is allowed to be infinite. * Fatou's lemma: If is a sequence of non-negative measurable functions, then : \\\\int \\\\liminf_k f_k \\\\, d \\\\mu \\\\leq \\\\liminf_k \\\\int f_k \\\\, d \\\\mu. :Again, the value of any of the integrals may be infinite. * Dominated convergence theorem: Suppose is a sequence of complex measurable functions with pointwise limit , and there is a Lebesgue integrable function (i.e., belongs to the such that for all . :Then, is Lebesgue integrable and : \\\\lim_k \\\\int f_k \\\\, d \\\\mu = \\\\int f \\\\, d \\\\mu.  Alternative formulations  It is possible to develop the integral with respect to the Lebesgue measure without relying on the full machinery of measure theory. One such approach is provided by the Daniell integral. There is also an alternative approach to developing the theory of integration via methods of functional analysis. The Riemann integral exists for any continuous function of compact support defined on (or a fixed open subset). Integrals of more general functions can be built starting from these integrals. Let be the space of all real-valued compactly supported continuous functions of ‚Ñù. Define a norm on by : \\\\left\\\\f \\\\right\\\\= \\\\int |f(x)\\\\, dx . Then is a normed vector space (and in particular, it is a metric space.) All metric spaces have Hausdorff completions, so let be its completion. This space is isomorphic to the space of Lebesgue integrable functions modulo the subspace of functions with integral zero. Furthermore, the Riemann integral is a uniformly continuous functional with respect to the norm on , which is dense in . Hence has a unique extension to all of . This integral is precisely the Lebesgue integral. More generally, when the measure space on which the functions are defined is also a locally compact topological space (as is the case with the real numbers ‚Ñù), measures compatible with the topology in a suitable sense (Radon measures, of which the Lebesgue measure is an example) an integral with respect to them can be defined in the same manner, starting from the integrals of continuous functions with compact support. More precisely, the compactly supported functions form a vector space that carries a natural topology, and a (Radon) measure is defined as a continuous linear functional on this space. The value of a measure at a compactly supported function is then also by definition the integral of the function. One then proceeds to expand the measure (the integral) to more general functions by continuity, and defines the measure of a set as the integral of its indicator function. This is the approach taken by and a certain number of other authors. For details see Radon measures.  Limitations of Lebesgue integral  The main purpose of the Lebesgue integral is to provide an integral notion where limits of integrals hold under mild assumptions. There is no guarantee that every function is Lebesgue integrable. But it may happen that improper integrals exist for functions that are not Lebesgue integrable. One example would be :\\\\frac{\\\\sin(x)}{x} over the entire real line. This function is not Lebesgue integrable, as : \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\left|\\\\frac{\\\\sin(x)}{x}\\\\rightdx =\\\\infty. On the other hand, \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{\\\\sin(x)}{x} dx exists as an improper integral and can be computed to be finite; it is twice the Dirichlet integral.

Reformulation of Schur‚ÄìHorn theorem In view of the equivalence of (i) and (ii) in the lemma mentioned above, one may reformulate the theorem in the following manner. Theorem. Let \\\\mathbf{d}=\\\\\\\\{d_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^N and \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}=\\\\\\\\{\\\\lambda_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^N be real vectors. There is a Hermitian matrix with diagonal entries \\\\\\\\{d_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^N and eigenvalues \\\\\\\\{\\\\lambda_i\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^N if and only if the vector (d_1, d_2, \\\\ldots, d_n) is in the permutation polytope generated by (\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\lambda_n). Note that in this formulation, one does not need to impose any ordering on the entries of the vectors \\\\mathbf{d} and \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}. Proof of the Schur‚ÄìHorn theorem Let A(=a_{jk}) be a n \\\\times n Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues \\\\\\\\{ \\\\lambda_i \\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^{n}, counted with multiplicity. Denote the diagonal of A by \\\\tilde{a}, thought of as a vector in \\\\mathbb{R}^n, and the vector (\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\lambda_n) by \\\\tilde{\\\\lambda}. Let \\\\Lambda be the diagonal matrix having \\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\lambda_n on its diagonal. (\\\\Rightarrow) A may be written in the form U\\\\Lambda U^{-1}, where U is a unitary matrix. Then :a_{ii} = \\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\lambda_j |u_{ij}|^2, \\\\; i = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, n Let S = (s_{ij}) be the matrix defined by s_{ij} = |u_{ij}|^2. Since U is a unitary matrix, S is a doubly stochastic matrix and we have \\\\tilde{a} = S\\\\tilde{\\\\lambda}. By the Birkhoff‚Äìvon Neumann theorem, S can be written as a convex combination of permutation matrices. Thus \\\\tilde{a} is in the permutation polytope generated by \\\\tilde{\\\\lambda}. This proves Schur's theorem. (\\\\Leftarrow) If \\\\tilde{a} occurs as the diagonal of a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues \\\\\\\\{ \\\\lambda_i \\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n, then t\\\\tilde{a} + (1-t)\\\\tau(\\\\tilde{a}) also occurs as the diagonal of some Hermitian matrix with the same set of eigenvalues, for any transposition \\\\tau in S_n. One may prove that in the following manner. Let \\\\xi be a complex number of modulus 1 such that \\\\overline{\\\\xi a_{jk}} = - \\\\xi a_{jk} and U be a unitary matrix with \\\\xi \\\\sqrt{t}, \\\\sqrt{t} in the j,j and k,k entries, respectively, -\\\\sqrt{1-t}, \\\\xi \\\\sqrt{1-t} at the j,k and k,j entries, respectively, 1 at all diagonal entries other than j,j and k,k, and 0 at all other entries. Then UAU^{-1} has ta_{jj} + (1-t)a_{kk} at the j,j entry, (1-t)a_{jj} + ta_{kk} at the k,k entry, and a_{ll} at the l,l entry where l e j,k. Let \\\\tau be the transposition of \\\\\\\\{1, 2, \\\\ldots, n\\\\\\\\} that interchanges j and k. Then the diagonal of UAU^{-1} is t\\\\tilde{a} + (1-t)\\\\tau(\\\\tilde{a}). \\\\Lambda is a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues \\\\\\\\{ \\\\lambda_i \\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n. Using the equivalence of (i) and (iii) in the lemma mentioned above, we see that any vector in the permutation polytope generated by (\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\lambda_n), occurs as the diagonal of a Hermitian matrix with the prescribed eigenvalues. This proves Horn's theorem. Symplectic geometry perspective The Schur‚ÄìHorn theorem may be viewed as a corollary of the Atiyah‚ÄìGuillemin‚ÄìSternberg convexity theorem in the following manner. Let \\\\mathcal{U}(n) denote the group of n \\\\times n unitary matrices. Its Lie algebra, denoted by \\\\mathfrak{u}(n), is the set of skew-Hermitian matrices. One may identify the dual space \\\\mathfrak{u}(n)^* with the set of Hermitian matrices \\\\mathcal{H}(n) via the linear isomorphism \\\\Psi : \\\\mathcal{H}(n) \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathfrak{u}(n)^* defined by \\\\Psi(A)(B) = \\\\mathrm{tr}(iAB) for A \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}(n), B \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{u}(n). The unitary group \\\\mathcal{U}(n) acts on \\\\mathcal{H}(n) by conjugation and acts on \\\\mathfrak{u}(n)^* by the coadjoint action. Under these actions, \\\\Psi is an \\\\mathcal{U}(n)-equivariant map i.e. for every U \\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}(n) the following diagram commutes, 200px Let \\\\tilde{\\\\lambda} = (\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\lambda_n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n and \\\\Lambda \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}(n) denote the diagonal matrix with entries given by \\\\tilde{\\\\lambda}. Let \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\tilde{\\\\lambda}} denote the orbit of \\\\Lambda under the \\\\mathcal{U}(n)-action i.e. conjugation. Under the \\\\mathcal{U}(n)-equivariant isomorphism \\\\Psi, the symplectic structure on the corresponding coadjoint orbit may be brought onto \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\tilde{\\\\lambda}}. Thus \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\tilde{\\\\lambda}} is a Hamiltonian \\\\mathcal{U}(n)-manifold. Let \\\\mathbb{T} denote the Cartan subgroup of \\\\mathcal{U}(n) which consists of diagonal complex matrices with diagonal entries of modulus 1. The Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{t} of \\\\mathbb{T} consists of diagonal skew-Hermitian matrices and the dual space \\\\mathfrak{t}^* consists of diagonal Hermitian matrices, under the isomorphism \\\\Psi. In other words, \\\\mathfrak{t} consists of diagonal matrices with purely imaginary entries and \\\\mathfrak{t}^* consists of diagonal matrices with real entries. The inclusion map \\\\mathfrak{t} \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\mathfrak{u}(n) induces a map \\\\Phi : \\\\mathcal{H}(n) \\\\cong \\\\mathfrak{u}(n)^* \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathfrak{t}^*, which projects a matrix A to the diagonal matrix with the same diagonal entries as A. The set \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\tilde{\\\\lambda}} is a Hamiltonian \\\\mathbb{T}-manifold, and the restriction of \\\\Phi to this set is a moment map for this action. By the Atiyah‚ÄìGuillemin‚ÄìSternberg theorem, \\\\Phi(\\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\tilde{\\\\lambda}}) is a convex polytope. A matrix A \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}(n) is fixed under conjugation by every element of \\\\mathbb{T} if and only if A is diagonal. The only diagonal matrices in \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\tilde{\\\\lambda}} are the ones with diagonal entries \\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\lambda_n in some order. Thus, these matrices generate the convex polytope \\\\Phi(\\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\tilde{\\\\lambda}}). This is exactly the statement of the Schur‚ÄìHorn theorem.

It was originally for industrial dynamics but was soon extended to other applications, including population and resource studies and urban planning. DYNAMO was initially developed under the direction of Jay Wright Forrester in the late 1950s, by Dr. Phyllis Fox, Alexander L. Pugh III, Grace Duren, and others at the M.I.T. Computation Center. DYNAMO was used for the system dynamics simulations of global resource-depletion reported in the Club of Rome's Limits to Growth, but has since fallen into disuse. Beginnings In 1958, Forrester unwittingly instigated DYNAMO's development when he asked an MIT staff programmer to compute needed solutions to some equations, for a Harvard Business Review paper he was writing about industrial dynamics. The programmer, Richard Bennett, chose to implement a system (SIMPLE - \\"Simulation of Industrial Management Problems with Lots of Equations\\") that took coded equations as symbolic input and computed solutions. SIMPLE became the proof-of-concept for DYNAMO: rather than have a specialist programmer \\"hard-code\\" a special-purpose solver in a general purpose programming language, users could specify a system's equations in a special simulation language and get simulation output from one program execution. Design goals DYNAMO was designed to emphasize the following: * ease-of-use for the industrial dynamics modeling community (who were not assumed to be expert programmers); * immediate execution of the compiled model, without producing an intermediate object file; and * providing graphical output, with line printer and pen plotter graphics. Among the ways in which DYNAMO was above the standard of the time, it featured units checking of numerical types and relatively clear error messages. Implementation The earliest versions were written in assembly language for the IBM 704, then for the IBM 709 and IBM 7090. DYNAMO II was written in AED-0, an extended version of Algol 60. Dynamo II/F, in 1971, generated portable FORTRAN code and both Dynamo II/F and Dynamo III improved the system's portability by being written in FORTRAN. Computer & Control Abstracts, Volume 11, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers p.1591 Originally designed for batch processing on mainframe computers, it was made available on minicomputers in the late 1970s, and became available as \\"micro-Dynamo\\" on personal computers in the early 1980s. The language went through several revisions from DYNAMO II up to DYNAMO IV in 1983,DYNAMO User's Manual, Sixth Edition, Impact and issues Apart from its (indirectly felt) public impact in environmental issues raised by the controversy over Limits to Growth, DYNAMO was influential in the history of discrete-event simulation even though it was essentially a package for continuous simulation specified through difference equations.\\"A History of Discrete Event Simulation Programming Languages\\", Richard E. Nance, TR 93-21, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (cross-listed as Systems Research Center report SRC 93-003), June 11, 1993 It has been said by some to have opened opportunities for computer modelling even for users of relatively low mathematical sophistication.The electronic oracle: computer models and social decisions (1985), Donella H.

He attained the rank of lieutenant colonel before leaving the military in 1779. He later served as the State Commissioner for Prisoners in Maryland. American Revolutionary War Rawlings was appointed as first lieutenant in Capt. Michael Cresap's Independent Rifle Company from Frederick County, Maryland.Revolutionary Patriots of Anne Arundel County, Maryland, pp. 161 Shortly afterward Cresap died, and Rawlings replaced him as company commander. On June 17, 1776 the company was joined to the newly formed Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment and Rawlings was named second-in-command and promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. When the regimental commander, Col. Hugh Stephenson, died in August 1776 Rawlings took command of the regiment. The unit consisted of approximately 250 riflemen, and was often referred to as \\"Rawlings' Regiment\\". During the Battle of Fort Washington the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was positioned about a half mile north of Fort Washington on Manhattan Island. From November 2 to November 14, 1776 they defended against German Hessian mercenaries, but on the 16th they were finally pushed back to Fort Washington, which surrendered a short time after.Southern Campaign American Revolution Pension Statements Rawlings was taken prisoner, but escaped. General Washington had also requested that Rawlings be released as part of a prisoner exchange.George Washington to Joshua Loring (January 14, 1777) Throughout the remainder of his military career, Rawlings often wrote to Washington concerning pay for his soldiers and recruits, as he had difficulty paying his soldiers. Washington's response often included requests that Rawlings use his own money to pay his soldiers until more money could be obtained from Congress.George Washington to William Palfrey (October 17, 1779)George Washington to Moses Rawlings (March 7, 1779) Post-War In 1779 Rawlings became the State Commissioner of Prisoners out of Frederick Town, Maryland.George Washington to Moses Rawlings (December 12, 1781) Family Rawlings was married to Elizabeth McMahon.
