The Commander in Chief of the Mysore Calicut Province, Sirdar Ali, took siege of the British Military Barrack of Thalassery for 18 months. They British and the local administrators were blockaded within Thalassery by land as well as by sea. It was during the Second Anglo-Mysore War. The siege continued until reinforcements from Bombay under the command of Major Abington attacked the Mysore army and defeated them. Major Abington then moved south, capturing Calicut. The Siege of Tellicherry led to the fall of strongholds of the First Mysore conquest, led by Hyder Ali. Even though laterTipu Sultan came from Mysore to reinstate the conquered area to previous status.A Survey Of Kerala History By A Sreedhara Menon Tellicherry (Thalassery) rose to become a fortified coastal harbor and major town under English East India Company control. The British got this site in 1705 from Kolathiri Raja of Northern Malabar. Hyder Ali, ruler of Mysore had no love lost for British and had already fought a war with British. His objective during second war was to oust British from South India and conquer whole of South India. Malabar was under continuous occupation of Hyder's troops since 1774 and whole country of Malabar was in a state of constant rebellion. The British supplied arms and ammunition to rebels and this displeased Hyder.https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofindi00buckuoft#page/86/mode/1up Also Tellicherry was a major naval base of the British in south west coast of India. Hyder's conquest of Tellicherry will be a big blow to British naval position in waters of Peninsular India. So in order to block flow of guns and ammunition to rebellious Rajahs and chiefs of Malabar as well as to cripple British naval power, Hyder Ali decided to conquer Tellicherry as part of his larger plan to oust British from South India. So Hyder ordered his vassal Rama Varma, Rajah of Chirakkal to besiege Tellicherry in 1778. Rajah did so with a large army but Hyder's opponent, Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja, acting Rajah of Kottayam (Thalassery) and an ally of British then, took to field and surrounded the besiegers of Tellicherry and cut off all their supplies and communications and forced them to retreat. But in 1779, Chirakkal army of 4,000 supported by a Mysore contingent of 2,500 men defeated Kottayam army and then invaded the neighboring pro-British kingdom of Kadathanad and installed a puppet Rajah on throne who put that part of Kadathanad army (2,000 men) which supported him at Hyder's disposal. This large host once more besieged Tellicherry in 1779 and as British garrison was perilously short on men and food, Pazhassi Rajah sent 1000 men and his entire surplus harvest to Tellicherry fort. This bought time for the beleaguered garrison. Soon siege progressed and British bought reinforcements and artillery. At the beginning, British had only two battalions in Tellicherry. But 1000 men of Pazhassi Rajah was soon supplemented by another four battalions and a good train of artillery.The Parliamentary Register; Or, History of the Proceedings and Debates of the [House of Lords and House of Commons]-J. Almon, 1793 British and their ally Kottayam contingent fought a desperate defense for months - each assault of the Mysore army was repelled and the siege went on till 1782. Then British command pondered over the plan suggested by Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja. British garrison must launch a sortie to break the besieger army into two and link up with another of his army who will strike enemy in rear. Soon they decided to adopt this plan. As British and Kottayam troops launched a furious assault on besiegers in 1782 - as planned sudden appearance of another 1000 men of Kottayam Rajah in rear proved fatal to Mysore army and their allies who were split into two halves. Enemy retreated in confusion and panic and a considerable number was taken prisoner. Sirdar Khan seriously wounded and sick fell prisoner and breathed his last in captivity. This disaster for Mysore army roused rebels all over Malabar into a massive rebellion and decimated all the Mysore regiments of occupation and recovered their freedom for a short period.

Gestalt psychologists argued that these principles exist because the mind has an innate disposition to perceive patterns in the stimulus based on certain rules. These principles are organized into five categories: Proximity, Similarity, Continuity, Closure, and Connectedness. Irvin Rock and Steve Palmer, who are acknowledged as having built upon the work of Max Wertheimer and others and to have identified additional grouping principles, note that Wertheimer's laws have come to be called the \\"Gestalt laws of grouping\\" but state that \\"perhaps a more appropriate description\\" is \\"principles of grouping.\\"Rock and Palmer helped to further Wertheimer's research to explain human perception of groups of objects and how we perceive parts of objects and form whole objects on the basis of these.  Proximity  Law of Proximity The Gestalt law of proximity states that \\"objects or shapes that are close to one another appear to form groups\\". Even if the shapes, sizes, and objects are radically different, they will appear as a group if they are close. * Refers to the way smaller elements are \\"assembled\\" in a composition. * Also called \\"grouping\\", the principle concerns the effect generated when the collective presence of the set of elements becomes more meaningful than their presence as separate elements. * (it also depends on a correct order for comprehension). * Grouping the words also changes the visual and psychological meaning of the composition in non- verbal ways unrelated to their meaning. * Elements which are grouped together create the illusion of shapes or planes in space, even if the elements are not touching. * Grouping of this sort can be achieved with tone or value, color, shape, size, or other physical attributes.  Similarity  Law of Similarity The principle of similarity states that perception lends itself to seeing stimuli that physically resemble each other as part of the same object.This allows for people to distinguish between adjacent and overlapping objects based on their visual texture and resemblance. Other stimuli that have different features are generally not perceived as part of the object. An example of this is a large area of land used by numerous independent farmers to grow crops. Our brain uses similarity to distinguish between objects which might lie adjacent to or overlap with each other based upon their visual texture. Each farmer may use a unique planting style which distinguishes his field from another. Another example is a field of flowers which differ only by color. The principles of similarity and proximity often work together to form a Visual Hierarchy. Either principle can dominate the other, depending on the application and combination of the two. For example, in the grid to the left, the similarity principle dominates the proximity principle and you probably see rows before you see columns.  Closure  Law of Closure The principle of closure refers to the mind‚Äôs tendency to see complete figures or forms even if a picture is incomplete, partially hidden by other objects, or if part of the information needed to make a complete picture in our minds is missing. For example, if part of a shape‚Äôs border is missing people still tend to see the shape as completely enclosed by the border and ignore the gaps. This reaction stems from our mind‚Äôs natural tendency to recognize patterns that are familiar to us and thus fill in any information that may be missing. Closure is also thought to have evolved from ancestral survival instincts in that if one was to partially see a predator their mind would automatically complete the picture and know that it was a time to react to potential danger even if not all the necessary information was readily available.  Good continuation  Law of good continuation When there is an intersection between two or more objects, people tend to perceive each object as a single uninterrupted object. This allows differentiation of stimuli even when they come in visual overlap. We have a tendency to group and organize lines or curves that follow an established direction over those defined by sharp and abrupt changes in direction.  Common fate  flock of birds. When visual elements are seen moving in the same direction at the same rate (optical flow), perception associates the movement as part of the same stimulus. For example, birds may be distinguished from their background as a single flock because they are moving in the same direction and at the same velocity, even when each bird is seen‚Äîfrom a distance‚Äîas little more than a dot. The moving 'dots' appear to be part of a unified whole. Similarly, two flocks of birds can cross each other in a viewer's visual field, but they will nonetheless continue to be experienced as separate flocks because each bird has a direction common to its flock. This allows people to make out moving objects even when other details (such as the objects color or outline) are obscured. This ability likely arose from the evolutionary need to distinguish a camouflaged predator from its background. The law of common fate is used extensively in user-interface design, for example where the movement of a scrollbar is synchronised with the movement (i.e. cropping) of a window's content viewport; The movement of a physical mouse is synchronised with the movement of an on-screen arrow cursor, and so on.  Good form  Principle of good form The principle of good form refers to the tendency to group together forms of similar shape, pattern, color, etc. Even in cases where two or more forms clearly overlap, the human brain interprets them in a way that allows people to differentiate different patterns and/or shapes. An example would be a pile of presents where a dozen packages of different size and shape are wrapped in just three or so patterns of wrapping paper, or the Olympic Rings.

His life and work was the subject of a 1988 monograph, Der Tiermaler Erwin Aichele by Hans Sch√∂ner Der Tiermaler Erwin Aichele by Hans Schoner, Germany, 1988 Early years Erwin Aichele studied fine art at the State Academy of Fine Arts Karlsruhe. He continued his studies in the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, where he was taught by the celebrated animal artist Heinrich von Z√ºgel. In 1911, Aichele passed his art teaching diploma and started work at the jewelry school in Pforzheim, Southern Germany. War years In 1915, Erwin Aichele joined the army and was sent to France as part of a communications team. His talent in draughtsmanship quickly came to the notice of his commanding officer and he was given the official function of war artist. Most of his surviving war drawings were executed in 1916 when, as part of the Third Battery FAR 185, he was stationed in Liry in Champagne. In June 1916, the troops moved to northern France. Aichele's drawings depict places such as Achery, Doingt, Laon, Vraignes, Soissons. On each drawing he made a precise note of place, time and subject. His preferred media included pencil, ink, charcoal and coloured pastels. His drawings are executed with considerable skill in the tradition of the nineteenth century. They depict daily life: military convoys, soldiers‚Äô billets and views of villages, as well as ruins and landscapes. Although he witnessed the horrors of war, little of this appears in his drawings. They are dispassionate and betray no feelings of hate, horror or despair. Aichele's last drawing in France is dated May 1918, shortly before a wound and nervous breakdown caused him to collapse into a coma. He was transferred to a military hospital in Polzen, Pomerania, and started drawing again during his convalescence. He returned home on the signature of the armistice. Animal Artist and Teacher In the aftermath of the war, Erwin Aichele resumed his teaching activities at Pforzheim's jewelry school. He also began painting again, focusing on wildlife and the semi-domesticated animals he reared. He worked in various media, including watercolours, oils, charcoal and pen and ink. In 1934, Aichele was put in charge of the animal drawing class at the State Academy of Fine Arts Karlsruhe. He was professor of the academy between 1936 and 1944. In 1940, Aichele left the Pforzheim jewelry school in order to teach at the town's School of Decorative Arts. His work was interrupted in the last years of the war when he was drafted into the Volksturm or Home Guard. He avoided joining the Nazi Party for the duration of the Third Reich. He continued to teach at the Institute of Decorative Art until 1952; he was director of the institute for some of this time. In the 1950s, he increasingly turned towards abstraction, though still using animals as his models. These paintings, mostly watercolours, remain his most celebrated works. The Aichele Home and Workshop In 1931, Erwin, his wife, Marie Charlotte, and three children moved into their new home in the kuenstlerkolonie (artists colony) in the village of Eutingen, near Pforzheim. The house had an adjoining atelier and animal enclosures. These allowed Aichele to keep all sorts of animals, which were to play an essential role in his life and work. Exhibitions In 1921, he participated for the first time in an exhibition at the celebrated Glaspalast (Munich), (the Glass Palace in Munich). Afterwards, he took part in many other group shows. His work was also displayed in solo exhibitions, especially in southern Germany, where he was particularly appreciated. In 1955, his work was exhibited in Paris for the first time. Honours In 1974, Erwin Aichele was made honorary citizen of Eutingen. The principal road in the kuenstlerkolonie was renamed Erwin- Aichele-Strasse. In 1988, the Society of Fine Art in Pforzheim honoured him with a retrospective: to mark the occasion, the publishing house, Hans Sch√∂ner, published a monograph with reproductions of his works. In 2009, an exhibition in southern Germany brought together the works of Erwin Aichele, his son, Wolfram Aichele and six of his artist grandchildren, Mathias Diebold, Nikolaus Diebold, Fridolin Diebold, Irmgard Jeserick, Benedikt Aichele and Alexandra Milton. Biography A book by British author, Giles Milton, Wolfram: The Boy Who Went To War,Wolfram: The Boy Who Went to War by Giles Milton, published by Sceptre in February 2011 is an account of the Eutingen childhood and adolescent war years of Erwin Aichele's second son, the artist Wolfram Aichele.

Besides its primary constituents ‚Äì nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and water vapour ‚Äì exhaled human breath contains over one thousand other compounds at trace levels.Wang et al. (2009). \\"Breath Analysis Using Laser Spectroscopic Techniques: Breath Biomarkers, Spectral Fingerprints, and Detection Limits\\" Sensors 2009, 9(10) Many of these species are formed as the by-products of metabolic processes and can be indicative of a number of different diseases and conditions. Examples of such biomarkers are outlined below: Acetone - Diabetes mellitus Ammonia - Renal DiseaseThorpe et al. (2008). \\"Cavity-enhanced optical frequency comb spectroscopy: application to human breath analysis\\" Optics Express, 16(4) Hydrogen Sulfide - Liver CirrhosisModugno et al.

(2006). \\"Breath hydrogen and methane in populations at different risk for colon cancer\\" International Journal of Cancer, 55(6)  Breath Acetone for Diabetes Diagnosis  Diabetes mellitus is a serious chronic illness that affects how the body uses food, and is a life-threatening human disease if left untreated. It affects more than 171 million people worldwide.Wild et al. (2004). \\"Global prevalence of diabetes: estimates for 2000 and projections for 2030\\" Diabetes Care, 27(5) Diabetes mellitus can be subdivided into; type I diabetes, where the body does not produce insulin, the hormone which facilitates the uptake of glucose by cells; and type II diabetes, where the body becomes resistant to insulin, thus inhibiting the extent of glucose usage. In each case, the ineffective use of glucose as a source of energy leads to the subsequent breakdown of fatty acids to compensate. This consumption of fatty acids by ketosis, produces acetone which is excreted into the blood, before equilibrating with air in the lungs. Diabetes may therefore be characterised by elevated breath acetone levels.Turner et al. (2009) \\"Breath acetone concentration decreases with blood glucose concentration in type I diabetes mellitus patients during hypoglycaemic clamps\\" Journal of Breath Research, 3(4) There are several new technologies being developed to diagnose and monitor diabetes by means of an acetone breath test. It is hoped that the breath test will one day supersede the use of finger-prick blood tests and provide non-invasive diabetes monitoring. These technologies include Cavity Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy (CEAS) and Plasma Emission Spectroscopy (PES).  Volatile Organic compound mixture for early diagnosis, phenotyping, and therapy response prediction  The current state of the art of breath diagnostics is the use of an Electronic nose to detect the complete mixture of Volatile organic compound (VOCs) in the human breath. Breathomix BV is providing the latest advancement: BreathBase¬Æ, https://www.breathomix.com/breathbase-solution/ that is able to diagnose lung cancer up to two years earlier than standard clinical care. It can tell doctors who will respond to immunotherapy and it is able to distinguish different subtypes of disease in asthma and COPD. Therefore, treatment of asthma / COPD will be easier and tailored to the individual patient bringing us a step closer to personalized medicine / precision medicine.  Breath aerosol analysis  Breath aerosol analysis consists in the sampling and analysis of particles emitted in the respiratory tract and present in exhaled breath.Almstrand A-C, Bake B, Ljungstrom E, Larsson P, Bredberg A, Mirgorodskaya E, et al. Effect of airway opening on production of exhaled particles. J Appl Physiol. 2010;108(3):584‚Äì8. This is a relatively new field that holds great promise for direct diagnostics of pathogens, such as Influenza, and for in-vivo monitoring of the respiratory lining fluid (Respiratory epithelium) components, such as proteins and phospholipids.Almstrand A-C, Ljungstr√∂m E, Lausmaa J, Bake B, Sj√∂vall P, Olin A-C. Airway Monitoring by Collection and Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Exhaled Particles. Anal Chem. 2009 Jan 15;81(2):662‚Äì8. Various methods are used for sampling exhaled breath aerosols, such as filters, impactors, impingement filter, or electrostatic precipitators. This latter field is related to that of Bioaerosol sampling and analysis.

Plot Trans-America Air Lines pilot \\"Three Star\\" Bob Halsey (Lyle Talbot) is in love with stewardess Judy Wagner (Ann Dvorak), but she wants him to stop his daredevil ways. So does his boss, Lackey (Charles C. Wilson). Confident in his abilities and knowing that he is the airline's best pilot, he pays neither any mind. Federal agent Brownell (Henry O'Neill) urgently requests Lackey's cooperation: Clement Williams (Edward McWade) must be flown from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., with a cylinder full of a revolutionary new explosive he has invented. However, Lackey's assistant Jason (Arthur Pierson) is eavesdropping on him for Taggart (Russell Hicks), a spy. He eavesdrops again when Lackey chooses Bob as pilot and Judy's brother Tom (Robert Light) as co- pilot. Taggart sends three men to provoke Bob into a fistfight. While Bob is knocked out, another pilot, George Wexley (Gordon Westcott), chats casually with Tom, \\"learns\\" that Bob is late for the special trip, and offers to protect Bob's job by taking over. Over the lower Sierras, the Ford Trimotor airliner explodes. Bob and Lackey fly to the crash site and talk to Brownell. Tom's cap is there. Back in Los Angeles, they report that there are no survivors. Frantic for news of her brother, Judy drives to the site before they return, evading the police roadblock. She is recognized by Jason, who is traveling with the spies to a nearby house they are using. Improvising a plan, they pose as federal agents and stop her. At the house she is surprised to see Wexley, who tells her the saboteur ordered him and Tom to parachute out, then set a bomb and himself parachuted out with the cylinder‚Äîall nearly true, except that Wexley was the saboteur and Tom is dead. They want to hide the cylinder in Judy's car and trick her into driving to Mexico, so Wexley says that Tom has gone to Tijuana to identify a suspect. She agrees to leave in the morning. But then the radio reports the recovery of Tom's body. Realizing her predicament, Judy pretends not to have heard. That night, finding some paint, she paints Bob's three-star personal logo on the porch roof of the house. Next day, back at Los Angeles, Bob learns Jason has left the office‚Äîwith the three men who knocked him out. He and Lackey then discover Jason's eavesdropping device. Bob flies back to the crash area. As his co-pilot he takes Wings, who works as the airline's mechanic because when he got his pilot's license he learned he was afraid to fly. They see the three stars and land. Bob tells Wings that if there is any sign of trouble he must fly away and alert the Air Patrol. When shots are fired, Wings does just thatnot seeing Bob and Judy running for the plane. The spies capture them both. Wexley and Taggart depart in Wexley's armed biplane, taking Judy and the cylinder. Wings then arrives with the Air Patrol, who capture the rest of the gang after a brief gunfight. In a dogfight between biplanes, Taggart is killed but the Air Patrol plane is shot down. Now rescued, Bob takes off with Wings. He finds Wexley's plane and executes risky maneuvers to force him to land. Wexley tries to run away and Wings throws a rock at him. Both Judy and the cylinder are recovered. Although the government is grateful, all that Judy and Bob want to do is get married.

He is chiefly known for his scholarly publications on European medieval literature, and in particular spiritual writers from that era. His 1962 anthology, The Medieval Mystics of England, is still widely used in university courses to this day. Chief among his works is his edition of A book of showings to the anchoress Julian of Norwich (published by the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, Toronto, 1978) which he co-edited with James Walsh. Life and career Born John Eric Colledge in Tynemouth,More precisely, Edmund Colledge, O. S. A., whose name in religion was adopted from Edmund Rich, was born in North Shields. Northumberland, Colledge graduated with first class honours in English from Liverpool University (LU) in 1932. He later earned an MA from LU in 1935, and also served as an Assistant Lecturer in LU's Department of English Language and Philology from 1937-1939. One of his influential professors at LU was John Henry Grafton Grattan (15 September 1878 ‚Äì 22 October 1951). In 1932-1933 he pursued further studies in Munich. As a student in Munich, he personally witnessed the rants of Adolf Hitler. Colledge was an excellent linguist with mastery of the French, German and Dutch languages. He was recruited by British Intelligence shortly after the outbreak of World War II, and spent the war working on military intelligence for Great Britain. In 1945-1946 he served on the Allied Control Council's committee which oversaw the restoration of German universities in Berlin. He returned to LU in 1946 as a full Lecturer, and was subsequently appointed Senior Lecturer (1952-1961) and Reader (1961-1963). He lectured on medieval literature and the history of the English language. Many of his students have gone on to chair English departments at universities in the United Kingdom and the United States. In addition to teaching, he also directed and acted in productions with the university's Dramatic Society. Through this interest he became friends with the actress Patricia Routledge while she was a Liverpool student. She credits Colledge for persuading her to pursue a professional acting career. In 1963 Colledge resigned from his post at LU in order to join the Order of Saint Augustine at Clare Priory in Suffolk. At this time he assumed the religious name of Brother Edmund. He pursued further religious studies in Rome, after which he was ordained a priest in 1967. In 1968 he became an Assistant Professor at the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He was soon after promoted to full Professor at that institution, remaining there through 1977. He then returned to England to join the teaching staff at Austin Friars St Monica's School in Carlisle.

Biography  Early life  Nothing is known of the circumstances of his birth or early years. In 1667 he was commissioned captain of , seeing service in the Second Anglo-Dutch War.The South Carolina Encyclopedia, p. 1015 West was probably attached to the service of one of the eight proprietors of Carolina, chief among whom were the Duke of Albemarle and Lord Shaftesbury. From his correspondence, preserved at the Public Record Office, his relations appear to have been specially close with the latter. On 27 July 1669 he was given the command of a small fleet and ordered by the proprietors to sail from London for Kinsale and thence by way of Barbados to Port Royal, Carolina, in the vicinity of which place he was to settle a new plantation under constitutions drawn up mainly by John Locke, the secretary of the proprietors. West was also appointed to act as storekeeper in the new colony.Cal. State Papers, America and West Indies, 1669‚Äì74, pp. 33‚Äì4 sq. West sailed from The Downs in the ship Carolina on 17 August 1669, and the expedition finally reached Port Royal on 17 March 1669/70. A few months later they began to settle Ashley River, as the new plantation was called, and Charles Town, the site of which was subsequently removed (1679‚Äì80) to Oyster Point.  South Carolina Governor  West, though he had no experience as a \\"planter\\", took a leading part in the conduct of affairs as deputy for the governor, William Sayle, whose health was failing. Sayle died on 4 March 1671, whereupon West was unanimously chosen governor by the colonial council. In the following December Sir John Yeamans claimed the governorship on the ground that he had been made a landgrave by the proprietors. The council expressed themselves so well satisfied with the administration of West that they resolved not to disturb him in his government; but shortly afterwards an express nomination of Yeamans to the post arrived from England, and in this the colonists acquiesced. West was at the same time appointed \\"register of all writings and documents\\". But Yeamans proved popular neither with the settlers nor with the proprietors, his health was feeble, he was suspected of avarice in private trading, and early in 1674 he retired to Barbados, leaving the field clear for West, to whom the proprietors on 18 May 1674 sent a patent to be landgrave and a commission to be governor.Cal. State Papers, p. 578 His salary was 100l. as governor and 60l. as storekeeper. The new governor's administration was marked by \\"care, fidelity, and prudence.\\" He obtained deeds of transfer of lands from Native American chiefs, made regulations respecting the militia, roads, the status of servants and slaves, and in his last parliament of May 1682 passed \\"acts for suppressing idleness, drunkenness, and profanity.\\" In the same year was commenced the building of the English church in Charles Town; but the utmost tolerance was extended to the religious dissenters, who comprised the larger part of the population. West was removed from the governorship towards the close of 1682, having, it is supposed, incurred the displeasure of the proprietors by permitting the sale and transport of Native American slaves from Carolina into other colonies. His dismissal was soon regretted, and in September 1684 he was reappointed governor; but for private reasons he resigned his post and left the colony in the summer of 1685. It is supposed that he visited London, where he seems to have left his wife, and that he returned eventually to his estate upon the Ashley River; but nothing is known definitely of his later career, and he died in 1691.

Introduction A general approach to the least squares problem \\\\operatorname{\\\\,min} \\\\, \\\\big\\\\\\\\mathbf y - X \\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta \\\\big\\\\^2 can be described as follows. Suppose that we can find an n by m matrix S such that XS is an orthogonal projection onto the image of X. Then a solution to our minimization problem is given by :\\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta = S \\\\mathbf y simply because : X \\\\boldsymbol \\\\beta = X ( S \\\\mathbf y) = (X S) \\\\mathbf y is exactly a sought for orthogonal projection of \\\\mathbf y onto an image of X (see the picture below and note that as explained in the next section the image of X is just a subspace generated by column vectors of X). A few popular ways to find such a matrix S are described below. Inverting the matrix of the normal equations The algebraic solution of the normal equations with a full-rank matrix XTX can be written as : \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}} = (\\\\mathbf X^ {\\\\rm T} \\\\mathbf X )^{-1} \\\\mathbf X^ {\\\\rm T} \\\\mathbf y = \\\\mathbf X^+ \\\\mathbf y where X+ is the Moore‚ÄìPenrose pseudoinverse of X. Although this equation is correct and can work in many applications, it is not computationally efficient to invert the normal- equations matrix (the Gramian matrix). An exception occurs in numerical smoothing and differentiation where an analytical expression is required. If the matrix XTX is well-conditioned and positive definite, implying that it has full rank, the normal equations can be solved directly by using the Cholesky decomposition RTR, where R is an upper triangular matrix, giving: : R^{\\\\rm T} R \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}} = X^{\\\\rm T} \\\\mathbf y. The solution is obtained in two stages, a forward substitution step, solving for z: : R^{\\\\rm T} \\\\mathbf z = X^{\\\\rm T} \\\\mathbf y, followed by a backward substitution, solving for \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}}: : R \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}}= \\\\mathbf z. Both substitutions are facilitated by the triangular nature of R. Orthogonal decomposition methods Orthogonal decomposition methods of solving the least squares problem are slower than the normal equations method but are more numerically stable because they avoid forming the product XTX. The residuals are written in matrix notation as :\\\\mathbf r= \\\\mathbf y - X \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}}. The matrix X is subjected to an orthogonal decomposition, e.g., the QR decomposition as follows. :X=Q \\\\begin{pmatrix} R \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\ , where Q is an m√óm orthogonal matrix (QTQ=I) and R is an n√ón upper triangular matrix with r_{ii}>0. The residual vector is left- multiplied by QT. :Q^{\\\\rm T} \\\\mathbf r = Q^{\\\\rm T} \\\\mathbf y - \\\\left( Q^{\\\\rm T} Q \\\\right) \\\\begin{pmatrix} R \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}}= \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\left(Q^{\\\\rm T} \\\\mathbf y \\\\right)_n - R \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left(Q^{\\\\rm T} \\\\mathbf y \\\\right)_{m-n} \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf u \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf v \\\\end{bmatrix} Because Q is orthogonal, the sum of squares of the residuals, s, may be written as: :s = \\\\\\\\mathbf r \\\\^2 = \\\\mathbf r^{\\\\rm T} \\\\mathbf r = \\\\mathbf r^{\\\\rm T} Q Q^{\\\\rm T} \\\\mathbf r = \\\\mathbf u^{\\\\rm T} \\\\mathbf u + \\\\mathbf v^{\\\\rm T} \\\\mathbf v Since v doesn't depend on Œ≤, the minimum value of s is attained when the upper block, u, is zero. Therefore, the parameters are found by solving: : R \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}} =\\\\left(Q^{\\\\rm T} \\\\mathbf y \\\\right)_n. These equations are easily solved as R is upper triangular. An alternative decomposition of X is the singular value decomposition (SVD) : X = U \\\\Sigma V^{\\\\rm T} \\\\ , where U is m by m orthogonal matrix, V is n by n orthogonal matrix and \\\\Sigma is an m by n matrix with all its elements outside of the main diagonal equal to 0. The pseudoinverse of \\\\Sigma is easily obtained by inverting its non-zero diagonal elements and transposing. Hence, : \\\\mathbf X \\\\mathbf X^+ = U \\\\Sigma V^{\\\\rm T} V \\\\Sigma^+ U^{\\\\rm T} = U P U^{\\\\rm T}, where P is obtained from \\\\Sigma by replacing its non-zero diagonal elements with ones. Since (\\\\mathbf X \\\\mathbf X^+)^* = \\\\mathbf X \\\\mathbf X^+ (the property of pseudoinverse), the matrix U P U^{\\\\rm T} is an orthogonal projection onto the image (column-space) of X. In accordance with a general approach described in the introduction above (find XS which is an orthogonal projection), : S = \\\\mathbf X^+ , and thus, : \\\\beta = V\\\\Sigma^+ U^{\\\\rm T} \\\\mathbf y is a solution of a least squares problem. This method is the most computationally intensive, but is particularly useful if the normal equations matrix, XTX, is very ill-conditioned (i.e. if its condition number multiplied by the machine's relative round-off error is appreciably large). In that case, including the smallest singular values in the inversion merely adds numerical noise to the solution. This can be cured with the truncated SVD approach, giving a more stable and exact answer, by explicitly setting to zero all singular values below a certain threshold and so ignoring them, a process closely related to factor analysis. Discussion The numerical methods for linear least squares are important because linear regression models are among the most important types of model, both as formal statistical models and for exploration of data-sets. The majority of statistical computer packages contain facilities for regression analysis that make use of linear least squares computations. Hence it is appropriate that considerable effort has been devoted to the task of ensuring that these computations are undertaken efficiently and with due regard to round-off error. Individual statistical analyses are seldom undertaken in isolation, but rather are part of a sequence of investigatory steps. Some of the topics involved in considering numerical methods for linear least squares relate to this point. Thus important topics can be *Computations where a number of similar, and often nested, models are considered for the same data-set. That is, where models with the same dependent variable but different sets of independent variables are to be considered, for essentially the same set of data-points. *Computations for analyses that occur in a sequence, as the number of data-points increases. *Special considerations for very extensive data-sets. Fitting of linear models by least squares often, but not always, arise in the context of statistical analysis. It can therefore be important that considerations of computation efficiency for such problems extend to all of the auxiliary quantities required for such analyses, and are not restricted to the formal solution of the linear least squares problem. Matrix calculations, like any other, are affected by rounding errors. An early summary of these effects, regarding the choice of computation methods for matrix inversion, was provided by Wilkinson.Wilkinson, J.H. (1963) \\"Chapter 3: Matrix Computations\\", Rounding Errors in Algebraic Processes, London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office (National Physical Laboratory, Notes in Applied Science, No.32) See also *Numerical linear algebra *Numerical methods for non-linear least squares References Further reading *Ake Bjorck, Numerical Methods for Least Squares Problems, SIAM, 1996. *R.

Geography The island is just beyond the upscale suburban construction of Nes√∏ya, reachable across the Vendelsund sound by cable ferry during the summer and a pontoon bridge in winter. It is among the largest islands in the Vestfjorden archipelago and is surrounded by islands: To the east is Ost√∏ya in B√¶rum, to the south is Lang√•ra (Asker) and to the west the small islands with descriptive names such as Katterompa (Cat's Rear End), Torbj√∏rns√∏y, Furuholmen (Pine Island), and Spannslokket (Pail Lid). The island's geology was formed in the Cambrian Period and is rich with limestone. History The island is recorded by name in sea charts from the early 16th century. The etymology of \\"Br√∏nn√∏ya\\" (variously spelled Br√∏nd√∏en, Br√∏nn√∏en, Brunneyr, Brun√∏en, Bry√∏en, Brund√∏en, and Brynd√∏en) stems from the presence of wells (Norwegian: br√∏nn) on the island, the source of water with an unusual ability to stay fresh in storage. This was a coveted commodity for expeditions during the sailboat era. In the late 16th century, bishop Jens Nilss√∏n recorded that a well (now empty) on the eastern side of the island is said to have been identified by the presence of the Virgin Mary and still has the name Mariakilden. The name of the well may stem from the 14th century. Several other wells are extant on the island, and some served as freshwater sources for the inhabitants well into the 1960s. left Remains of two Nordic Stone Age settlements have been found on the island that may stem from 4000 BCE (when the tide was 40‚Äì50 meters higher than today), and there are traces of agricultural activity going back at least 1500 years. The island became part of the considerable estate known as Nes√∏ygodset that was formed in the late 14th century following the Black Death Recorded owners of the island include, in chronological order: * Jon Toraldson (riksr√•d) * Olaf H√•konson Stumpe * Bo Peders√∏n Flemming * Holger Eriksen Rosenkrantz (in the Rosenkrantz family until 1663) * Knud Frantzen, who sold much of the acreage in Nes√∏ygodset, but seems to have held on to Br√∏nn√∏ya (1663-early 1700s) * Bartolomeus Adamsen, who had been a tenant farmer and was related by marriage to the first known tenant farmer on the island, Nils Br√∏n√∏en (early 1700s-1710) * Adam Bartolomeussen, his son (1710‚Äì1724) * Hans Christensen Aarhus Oust acquired the farm for 2000 riksdaler (1724-1724) * Christen Hansen Aarhus, his son (1745‚Äì1781) * Christian Christensen Aarhus, who separated the property from the farm on Ost√∏ya(1783‚Äì1814) * Marte Andersdatter, Christen's wife and her two children (1814‚Äì1822), when the farm and island were sold * Haagen Andersen, who married Marte and bought the property (1822‚Äì1837) * Christian Haagensen, their son, (1822‚Äì1860) * Ander Haagensen, his younger brother (1860‚Äì1888) * Maren Dorthea, his wife and children (1888‚Äì1890) * Donato Brambani (1890‚Äì1907) * Marie Plahte, at which point it became part of the farm at H√∏vik (1907‚Äì1916) * Viktor Plahte, her son (1916‚Äì1928) * Rudolf Myhre and Alf Monsen took over in 1928, at which point parcels on the island were sold In 1826 the farm (also known as Br√∏nn√∏ya) had under cultivation. The island was also the site of lime pits and kilns. There is evidence of limestone quarries going back to the 14th century. The industrialist Donato Brambani established a large scale lime kiln that was in full operation from 1892 to 1899. It was shut down in 1902, but a large kiln remains intact as one of the attractions of the island. The island is within the postal code for Nes√∏ya Zoning controversy Residential pathway on the island Since the island was subdivided in the 1920s, its use has evolved. In 1928, the island was regulated primarily for purposes of \\"villa residences with servant quarters in separate structures.\\" A number of other requirements were also established, including minimum lot size (2 metric dunams), and common areas. This was progressive in its time, but the term \\"villa residence\\" left much open to interpretation, leading to controversy over time. Although there is a general consensus that the island needs to maintain its unique character, there have, broadly speaking been two camps that have opposed each other on the means for preservation. They are represented in the public by two organizations: Br√∏nn√∏yas Venner, known as Venneforeningen (the Friends of Br√∏nn√∏ya) and Br√∏nn√∏ya Grunneierforening, known as Grunneierforeningen (the property association). The controversy about the zoning of the island reached its most intense level in the 1970s, but controversy persists to this day. In addition to the 16 lots that are legally approved as permanent dwellings, there are 34 that are de facto permanent homes for their residents. The central issue therefore relates to whether more of the island should be rezoned to permit permanent dwellings. Venneforeningen resists such regulation, insisting that the primary use of the island remain housing for leisure. Grunneierforeningen favors allow for more permanent dwelling, but under certain strict conditions to prevent urbanization and congestion. There appears to be agreement that the island remain free of motor vehicle traffic. Some favor a permanent bridge to ease access; others feel this is a slippery slope toward allowing automobiles on the island. A new zoning plan went into effect in 1995 that seemed to favor the conservationist leanings of Venneforeningen. However, issues persist with respect to use of municipal infrastructure, maintenance of the natural landscape, and environmental concerns. Access As long as the entire island was owned by one party, access to the island was via private boat. During the winter, there would typically be roads over the ice, both for pedestrian traffic and carriages. There were accidents, and there are several recorded instances of drownings off the island. When Myhre and Monsen started selling lots on the island, public access was required. This took two forms: across the Vendel sound, and via scheduled ferry landings. Vendel sound access Pontoon bridge across Vendel Sound, seen from Nes√∏ya By 1928, when Myhre and Monsen started selling lots, the public road to the southern end of Nes√∏ya was also complete. In return for room and board and a fee for passage, a ferryman would bring passengers across the sound as needed. It turned out to be difficult both to staff this position and to decide who the employer would be. In 1953, the nursing home on the island was acquired by Jens H. Koefoed, who was impressed by the cable ferry between Orm√∏ya and Padda in Oslo. In 1955 he set up the first cable ferry across the Vendel sound. He also installed a pontoon bridge that floated on railroad ties, yet without hand rails. This worked well when the sound was frozen, but when the ice thawed and broke, pedestrians usually had to run across the bridge to stay dry. The ties were presently replaced by empty oil barrels. By the 1960s, several forces converged to improve access. Both the municipality and private owners had taken steps to acquire harbor sites on the island, auto ownership and traffic was increasing, and there was increased interest in commuting between Oslo and Br√∏nn√∏ya. The municipality expropriated the lot needed to build a walkway from the bridge landing to the road on Nes√∏ya, and the harbormaster approved the use of the cable ferry. It soon became apparent that both the cable ferry and the pontoon bridge needed to be modernized. Replacing the barrels that sprung leak became an urgent but arduous routine, and the ferry was not able to handle pedestrian traffic at peak periods during the summer. In 1973, Jak Haukvik, one of the island's long-term residents, engineered a new cable ferry based on a raft, rather than, boat design. Although it took more effort to operate, and particularly under windy weather conditions, it could hold far more passengers and was less likely to flip. On Midsummer's in 1982, however, the cable ferry capsized, due to already significant overload, when a passenger leaped from the pier onto the ferry after it had departed. One person was seriously injured, and the resident association (\\"vel\\") was found liable. Since then, the ferry has been replaced with a new version, and the ferry is shut down during Midsummer. Public ferry For centuries, it was easier to travel the Oslofjord by sea than by land. By 1835 there was regularly scheduled ferry routes from Oslo (then Kristiania) to Sandvika. By 1890, the ferries \\"Vesta\\" and \\"Sartor\\" made scheduled stops at Br√∏nn√∏ya, on the northern end, with the ferries sailing through the Vendel sound. In addition to the northern landing, three additional public landings were established on the island: the western landing, and then the eastern and southern landings. At one point, six separate ferries made regular stops at one or several of these landings. Even though sections of the fjord had naval mines, ferry traffic continued through World War II. In particular, the ferry D/S Sport was considered a faithful servant of the island's community. But by 1952, ferry service had been reduced to the point that only one ferry provided regular service, and then with mixed reliability. The ferry \\"Silius\\" had a capacity of 150 passengers, which was not enough. Another ship, \\"Trollhaug\\" was added. It was fast but notoriously unreliable, and several other ferries afterwards continued to disappoint the community. In the spring of 1952 there was for a short time no ferry service between Oslo and the island. By 1955, however, there were three reasonably reliable ferries in operation. In addition to \\"Silius,\\" there was \\"Rigmor\\" and \\"Vestfjordbussen\\" that made regular stops at Br√∏nn√∏ya. Service between Sandvika and Br√∏nn√∏ya between 1948 and 1968 was provided by Einar Andersen, who shuttled passengers on board a retired lifeboat (from Stavangerfjord) starting at 5:30 am until 10 pm. In 1952, the ferry Rigmor started providing additional capacity for existing ships, but over the years the ship has become a virtual institution in the Vestfjorden archipelago. Nature View west from Br√∏nn√∏yaThe island is also notable for its diverse flora, a result of sailships unloading ballast when loading quicklime. In the last 150 years, there have been found 147 redlisted species, of which 8 are critically endangered and 35 are endangered. There are several nature reserves on the island, including Viernbukta, where grey heron are sighted Commonly seen plants on the island include: Valeriana sambucifolia, Geranium sanguineum, Geranium robertianum, Lotus corniculatus, Sedum acre, Hylotelephium maximum, Silene vulgaris, Silene uniflora, Potentilla erecta, and others. In the spring, the island is overrun with Hepatica nobilis and Anemone nemorosa. Br√∏nn√∏ya today The island today consists of 362 private parcels of land. Of these, 16 are registered as permanent dwellings, and 261 are leisure dwellings. The island is closed for motorized traffic all year. After an accident during celebrations in 1982, the cable ferry is closed the night of Midsummer. There are three ferry landings on the island that have seasonal and sporadic service. Beaches are public and maintained by the island communal organization. The island's future is a matter of some controversy. Some want to make it more accessible for a larger share of permanent residents and more tourist and weekend traffic; others feel that it should remain somewhat remote and protected.

Then a vector bundle V over X is essentially finite if and only if there exists a finite k-group scheme G and a G-torsor p:P\\\\to X such that V becomes trivial over P (i.e. p^*(V)\\\\cong O_P^{\\\\oplus r}, where r=rk(V)). Definition Let X be a scheme and E a vector bundle on X. For f = a_0 + a_1 x + \\\\ldots + a_n x^n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_{\\\\ge 0}[x] an integral polynomial with nonnegative coefficients define :f(E) := \\\\mathcal{O}_X^{\\\\oplus a_0} \\\\oplus E^{\\\\oplus a_1} \\\\oplus \\\\left(E^{\\\\otimes 2}\\\\right)^{\\\\oplus a_2} \\\\oplus \\\\ldots \\\\oplus \\\\left(E^{\\\\otimes n}\\\\right)^{\\\\oplus a_n} A vector bundle E is called finite if there are two distinct polynomials f, g for which f(E) is isomorphic to g(E). A bundle is essentially finite if it's a subquotient of a finite vector bundle.

She served in the East Indies, China and South America, but was accidentally burnt while out of commission on 27 September 1840. Design and construction Designed by Sir Robert Seppings in 1828, the Conway class were a broader version of of 1826. They were intended as sixth rates, which placed them in a category of ships with more than 24 but less than 36 guns, and commanded by an officer of the rank of captain. These ships were constructed of wood in traditional shipbuilding fashion, although iron braces and trussed were used for increased longitudinal strength. They were armed with a traditional arrangement of broadside, smoothbore muzzle- loading guns, and in common with contemporary Royal Navy practice for small ships, these guns were carronades (with the exception of a pair of small long guns on the focsle as chasers). Twenty 32-pounder carronades were mounted on the upper deck and a further six 18-pounder carronades were placed on the quarterdeck. The sail plan was an entirely conventional ship rig, and they were complemented with 175 men and boys. Operational service After commissioning on 1 October 1831 for the East Indies, she sailed via the Cape of Good Hope for Calcutta. In October 1832 she sailed from Madras for a cruise to New South Wales, visiting the Swan River, Hobart and Sydney. In May 1833 she delivered James Busby, the British Resident to the Bay of Islands, New Zealand, and arriving back in India on 11 October 1833. Between November 1833 and August 1834 she visited Ceylon, Mauritius, Malacca and Singapore before being sent to China. Under the command of Captain Price Blackwood she was in action against the Bogue forts at the mouth of the Pearl River on 7 September 1834 in company with Andromache and Louisa. Although five ports, including Canton, had been opened to foreigners earlier the same year, local Chinese forces tried to prevent the passage of the Royal Navy ships. After a couple of days of intermittent action the Chinese forts were silenced at the cost of 2 killed and 7 wounded, and after local officials had disavowed the military action, the ships proceeded to Whampoa.Clowes pp. 273‚Äì274 Returning to England via Manilla and the Cape of Good Hope in 1834 and 1835, she was recommissioned at Portsmouth on 11 June 1836. From June 1836 until December 1839 she served on the south-east coast of America under the command of Captain (later Admiral) Henry William Bruce. She was out of commission at Plymouth from January 1840. Fate The Fire on the morning of 27 September, which destroyed Talavera and Imogene threatened to destroy Devonport dockyard Imogene was accidentally burnt at Plymouth on 27 September 1840 while in ordinary.http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/2552459 Devonport dockyard was the scene of large scale fire which started in the North Dock. and Imogene were completely gutted, the fire spread to the whose fire was successfully put out, and to nearby buildings and equipment.

The South Korean version of the American Disney Channel replaced the Southeast Asian version which was available in the country with Korean subtitles since June 1, 2002 until June 30, 2011. History The company, which would operate all future Disney-branded channels in South Korea, was established as a joint venture on June 1, 2010, then legally called Television Media Korea Ltd. (TMK); at launch, SK Telecom (a mobile network operator and the flagship company of South Korean SK Group's telecommunication businesses) owned 51% of shares, and Disney Channels Worldwide owned the other 49%. When a certain business of SK Telecom was spun off into a subsidiary named SK Planet on October 1, 2011, Telecom's share in the company was also taken over by Planet. On September 30, 2015, SK Planet sold their stake in the company to The Walt Disney Company (Korea), LLC, a local subsidiary of Disney in South Korea, making Disney take full control of the channel. In February 2016, the company changed its legal name to Disney Channels Korea Ltd. The company also operates the South Korean version of Disney Junior, which replaced the Southeast Asian equivalent on South Korean television platforms 10 days after the launch of its sister network on July 11, 2011.

Highfill, Jr., Kalman A. Burnim, Edward A. Langhans, A Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Volume 15 was an English actress and memoirist. Early life She was the daughter of Thomas Davies, a carver and gilder who was born there on 16 December 1762 in Birmingham. Her father died whilst being held in a madhouse. Her widowed mother kept a tavern whose customers included the actor Richard Yates. Yates arranged for Mary to appear in a breeches role as the young Duke of York in Richard III at the Birmingham Theatre. She went to appear as Cupid in William Whitehead's Trip to Scotland, and as Arthur in King John. In Gloucester, she played Juliet and married the Mr Wells who played Romeo at Chad's Church in Shrewsbury. The marriage did not last long and she was abandoned. On the London stage On 1 June 1781, as Madge in Isaac Bickerstaffe's Love in a Village and Mrs. Cadwallader in Samuel Foote's Author, she made her first appearance at the Haymarket. John Genest says that she was excellent in both characters. Jenny in Lionel and Clarissa (Bickerstaffe) followed, and on 3 September in John O'Keeffe's Agreeable Surprise she was the first Cowslip, a name that stuck to her (though she is occasionally spoken of as ‚ÄòBecky‚Äô Wells). Genest wrote that nothing could be superior to her acting as Cowslip and that of John Edwin as Lingo. Mary Wells as Lavinia in Titus Andronicus, 1785 engraving by John Thornthwaite, after William Hamilton. On 25 September, as Nancy in Love in a Camp, she made her first appearance at Drury Lane, where she also played on 29 October. Jenny in the Gentle Shepherd, adapted from Allan Ramsay by Richard Tickell. Harriet in the Jealous Wife, Widow O'Grady in the Irish Widow, Flora in She Would and She Would Not (Colley Cibber), and Jacintha in the The Suspicious Husband followed. At the Haymarket in 1782 her name appears to Molly in the English Merchant and Bridget in the The Chapter of Accidents (Sophia Lee). She also, as she says, replaced Mrs. Cargill, who had eloped, as Macheath in the Beggar's Opera, with the male characters played by women and vice versa. She made a distinguished success, and was received with great enthusiasm. She played at Drury Lane Kitty Pry in The Lying Valet, and Jane Shore on 30 April 1783, her first appearance in tragedy. At the Haymarket she was on 6 July 1784 the original Fanny in Elizabeth Inchbald's Mogul's Tale, on 6 September the first Maud in O'Keeffe's Peeping Tom, the eponymous Isabella, and Lady Randolph in Douglas. Nancy Buttercup, an original part in O'Keeffe's Beggar on Horseback, was seen at the Haymarket on 16 June 1785. On 14 December she made her first appearance at Covent Garden as Jane Shore (in her own opinion, her best performance), playing also Laura in Edward Topham's farce The Fool, which her acting commended to the public. After repeating Lady Randolph and Isabella, she was on 5 January 1786 Imogen in Cymbeline; William Woodfall in the Morning Chronicle awarded her praise for the performance. Andromache in the Distressed Mother (Ambrose Philips) followed, and was succeeded by Shakespearean heroines (Rosalind, Portia), and Fidelia in the Plain Dealer; and she was on 24 April the first Eugenia in The Bird in a Cage, or Money works Wonders, altered from James Shirley. At the Haymarket in 1786 she played some unimportant original parts. When John Palmer made in 1787 his trial effort at the Royalty Theatre, Wellclose Square, she gave her imitations of Mrs. Siddons and other actresses, and was paid ¬£50 a night. She came back to Covent Garden, where she was on 17 September 1787 Mrs. Page in the Merry Wives of Windsor and played Lady Percy, Lady in Comus, Rosina, Anne Lovely, and Fatima in Cymon. Here she remained some time, acting in the summer at Cheltenham, Brighton, and Weymouth, where she was favoured by royalty. Personal troubles She had three daughters with a writer named Edward Topham. At the beginning of 1787 Topham started a newspaper called the World and Fashionable Advertiser. Wells was at first lauded by the paper but as time went by she ended up managing it. She was a guarantor for her brother-in-law and this resulted in her being imprisoned for debt in the Fleet Prison. Whilst there she met a Sephardic Jew named Joseph Sumbel who was imprisoned for contempt and they married in prison. She became a Jew and took the name Leah. Sumbel was a secretary to the ambassador from Morocco. Sumbel tried unsuccessfully to have the marriage annulled. She later became a Christian again. Last years and death She does not seem to have acted much later than 1790, though she gave her imitations at private houses; and once attempted to give them publicly during Lent, but was prevented by the bishop of London. She spent her later years in lodgings with her aged mother. She also applied to the Covent Garden Theatrical Fund, and received an annuity of ¬£55 until her death in London on 23 January 1829. She was buried in St Pancras, London.[Wells [n√©e Davies; other married name Sumbel], Mary Stephens (1762-1829), actress, The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography] Works She published in 1811 Memoirs of the Life of Mrs. Sumbel, late Wells, of the Theatres Royal Drury Lane, Covent Garden, and Haymarket, written by herself, (London, 3 vols.) The three volumes of this rambling autobiography are occupied principally with details of travels in search of her children, who refused to know her, or of friends. The remainder stock seems to have received a new title-page in 1828, when it appeared as Anecdotes and Correspondence of Celebrated Actors and Actresses, including Mr. Reynolds, Mr. Kelly, Mr. Kemble, Mr. Colman, Mrs. Siddons, &c.; Also an Account of the Awful Death of Lord Lyttelton. Her portrait, in the character of Cowslip in the Agreeable Surprise, was engraved by John Downman (Bromley, p. 447). A portrait of her by Dewilde, as Anne Lovely in A Bold Stroke for a Wife, is in the Mathews collection in the Garrick Club. An engraving by J. R. Smith from his own picture of her as Cowslip was published by Ackerman in 1802.

It is formed mainly in tidal flats but can also be formed in glacial environments. Examples from fluvial environments have been documented but are rare.Martin, A.J., 2000, Flaser and wavy bedding in ephemeral streams: a modern and an ancient example, Sedimentary Geology, 136, 1-5. Heterolithic bedding forms in response to alternations in sediment supply and tidal velocity. The fluctuations result in the interbedded layers of sand and mud. The rippled sand layer is formed during high tidal currents, while the mud is deposited during slack tide periods .The three main types of heterolithic bedding are flaser, wavy, and lenticular. Starved ripples and cross bedding with flasers can also be considered forms of heterolithic bedding. Differentiating of these various types of heterolithic bedding is based on the relative volume of mud and sand. This key determining factor is controlled by the timing, and duration of both the high tide, and slack tide depositional periods.Reineck, H.,Wunderlich, F., 1968, Classification and Origin of Flaser and Lenticular Bedding, Sedimentology, 11, 99-104.Davis, Richard A., Coastal Sedimentary Environments, Second Revised Expanded Edition, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1985. Heterolithic bedding types Flaser bed Flaser bedding, vertical section. If the amount of deposited sand exceeds mud deposits, we get ripples with isolated mud drapes in ripple troughs and crests. This type of sedimentary structure is called flaser bedding. Flaser bedding can be subdivided according to how the mud is deposited over the rippled sand. The various types of flaser bedding are simple flaser, bifurcated flaser, wavy flaser, and bifurcated wavy flaser. Simple flaser bedding is when the flasers do not contact one another and they are concave when the bed is upright. Mud in simple flaser deposits is limited to ripple troughs. Bifurcated flaser bedding occurs when a second flaser is deposited over a pre-existing flaser. The bifurcated flasers resemble a sideways ‚Äúy‚Äù shape. Wavy flaser bedding occurs when a flaser drapes both the ripple trough and crest but forms no continuous layer. Wavy bedding If mud and sand deposits are equal, wavy bedding is produced. Wavy bedding occurs when mud is deposited over the whole area of a bed of rippled and/or cross stratified sand. It usually loosely follows the alternating concave-convex nature of the ripples creating a wavy appearance. In wavy bedding the ripples are laterally discontinuous. Wavy bedding marks the boundary between flaser and lenticular bedding. Lenticular bedding Lenticular bedding formation from the Pennsylvanian of Kentucky. Shows the characteristic large quantities of mud covering 'lens-like' sand. Lenticular bedding occurs when sand ripples are deposited in mud in an isolated distribution pattern. Ripples in lenticular bedding are both laterally and horizontally discontinuous. Lenticular bedding can be subdivided according to whether or not they have connected lenses and the type of lenses they feature. Lenticular bedding with connected lenses can have up to 75% of discontinuous lenses. Lenticular bedding with single lenses has to have more than 75% discontinuous lenses. Lens thickness is based on a length to height ratio. Thick lenses have a length/height ratio that is <20 and flat lens ratio is >20. So the possible types of lenticular bedding are lenticular bedding with connected flat or thick lenses and lenticular bedding with single flat or thick lenses.

Characters Main characters ; * : The main protagonist and a normal middle school boy who dies at the beginning of the series (in the manga he was hit by a van that went out of control after ricocheting off Flandre, whereas in the anime he was hit by a falling iron I-beam after pushing Hime out of the way). He finds himself in Hime's service as he is bound to her because her blood (flame, in the anime) revived him. Though young and not very strong, Hiro manages to assist Hime (mostly by being a human shield) through his \\"half-immortality\\" that was given to him after his resurrection. At first, he is rather involuntarily involved in the battles but as he learns more about Hime, he is willing to protect her. His body changes in the manga when Hime's life is in danger, a fact that he notices and causes him to rush to Hime, though this is left out in the anime. He is very brave. : In the anime episode 24, Hiro realizes he has developed feelings for Hime and tries to kiss her, but she slaps him in the face, not because she did not want him to kiss her (this is uncertain), but because the gang was watching them, a theory made from what Reiri said in that moment: \\"Hiro, you were too slow.\\" It was stated by Sherwood, and apparently noticed by Hime, that Hiro has the potential to become the greatest blood warrior. The reason was not shown, because Hiro runs to save Hime before Sherwood can reveal the reason. In chapter 35, it is also implied that Hiro has some sort of connection to the monster world, which makes him special. This was stated by Gilliam, after his assassination attempt failed because of Hiro's intervention. Weapons used: Grass Cutter, Axe, Broomstick, Candle Stick, Metal Pole. ; * : The titular character of the series, a young 17-year-old aristocratic woman wearing Gothic clothing and apparently of German descent. Hime is the second royal princess of the Phoenix Tribe whose real name is , though she hates being referred by that name. Though a member of the Royal Family, Hime has no active interest in inheriting the throne though is forced to fight against her siblings due to their kind's rulings that the siblings must kill each other. This is due to the fact that Phoenixes are mortal before fully maturing and thus would disrupt order among the monsters if multiple adult phoenixes endlessly battle for the throne. Though playfully arrogant, she is desensitized towards violence and is not above personally killing an opponent with various weapons suited for the scenario. As a member of the royal family, Hime can convert a corpse into a half-immortal soldier through her blood, or Flame of Life in the anime, with the reanimated servant's life needing to be prolonged. While this ability can be used on anything that has died, it is considered Taboo for user to use it on themself, other members of their clan, or those that they personally killed. Prior to the series, she had an army of servants who all laid down their lives to ensure her escape when her castle was compromised by zombies sent by her brother Severin. She resurrects Hiro on a whim after he died saving her when she moved to Sasanaki Village out of fascination towards the human. She becomes a temporary half-vampire in order to save Hiro in the manga chapter 'Princess Blood.' Her relationship with Hiro remains uncertain in the anime, but they are clearly becoming closer in the manga. :In chapters 47 and 55, an alternate version of her is shown to have been forcefully transported nine years into the future. As soon as she arrives, she is attacked by a powerful monster that nearly overwhelms her, but wins thanks to the encouragement of the present day Hiro who she contacts via Riza's cellphone. She later walks to Sherwood's mansion where she learns only they and Sylvia remain. She leaves everything to Sherwood and confronts Sylvia at her mansion. They have a duel but is severely wounded by the mermaid who Sylvia entrusted to Emile. Sylvia then swings her sword down at her; however, future Hiro intervenes and stops the blow and rescues her. Following her final battle with Sylvia, Hime loses her abilities as a Phoenix and is allowed to live a normal life while going by her real name. Weapons used: Rapier, Chainsaw, Axe, Hammer, Cross-Sword, Circular Saw, Defibrillator, Broken Cue Stick, Flail, Mace, Pitchfork, Baseball Bat, Traps, Trident, Dumplings, Katana, Chandelier, Revolver, Shotgun, Sword, Rifle, Jackhammer. ; * : A child-like gynoid in the service of Hime, nicknamed \\"Flan\\". Her small stature belies her strength and dense body. Like other robots that were created by Frankenstien to serve the Royal Family, Flan is assigned as Hime's bodyguard and menial labor with a self-destruct protocol installed to activate the moment Hime dies. Although she puts on the same expression all the time, she knows when her friends are in danger. She assists Hime in moving objects, serves as a driver, and occasionally helps Hiro. She only says one word: \\"Hooba\\" in the English version, \\"Fuga\\" (or sometimes Huga depending on the translation) in the Japanese. She has a special function in her eyes to view hard-to-see things, her vision has a German language HUD and she knows how to drive vehicles. Being a gynoid, her weight is a few tons and she runs out of power and needs recharging. In episode 10 of the series, Flandre formed a relationship with Ciel, alongside helping repair him. :In the anime special, she went berserk when she wound up with a screw loose. Emile got Flanders to remedy that and prevented her from self-destructing. Weapons used: Broken Tree, Lance, Chainsaw, Telephone/Electricity Mast. ; * : Hiro's sister, who is a maid employed by Hime. Her cooking is recognized by Hime as the best. She is seemingly oblivious to the supernatural aspects of and surrounding Hime, nor does she seem to understand Hiro's explanation of his immortality. Hiro sometimes appears troubled that his sister is so dense but in truth it is rather convenient because he could never make up excuses that would explain everything without mentioning the supernatural. She lives a normal life in spite of all the supernatural phenomena happening around her, and is completely oblivious to it. Sawawa is also known for having unusually large breasts. : In the future, she is stated to have died from the bomb explosion that threw Hime into the future. : In the anime, her surname is also Hiyorimi as she introduced herself to Hime. In the manga, there is not much shown of her, but she appeared more in the anime where she is often shown eating strawberry parfaits at the caf√©. Her age is unknown but it's somewhere between senior year highschool and maybe second year of university if she attended. Always dresses in a maid outfit even when going out, has natural, large bouncy breasts (D cup?) and an extremely easygoing kind nature who accepts everybody and looks at the good in people. For example, not batting an eye when Riza freeloads despite her rough nature or inviting a vampire into the house courteously even though it was a stranger. A running gag in the anime involves her sitting up in shock while eating at a nearby cafe whenever Hiro sustains an injury that would be lethal under ordinary circumstances, suddenly think of something minor like noticing a new menu item (and never thinking of anything violent or scary in nature,) only to calm down and go back to eating her parfait. She addresses Hime as \\"Oujo-Sama\\" (Mistress in English). ; * : A half-breed tomboy girl who is the daughter of the werewolf Volg Wildman and an unnamed human mother, raised by her brother (named Lobo Wildman in anime) under the ideals of being a honorable werewolf clan. When Riza confronts Hime over killing her brother, she learns her brother died honorably and that the fight was orchestrated by Prince Duken using her to force her brother to attack Hime. Thus Riza offers her services to Hime in the hopes of avenging her brother should Duken attack Hime. As a hybrid, possessing superhuman strength and senses while less physically powerful compared to a full-blooded werewolf, Riza can turn her forearms into large wolf paws while practically invincible under the light of a full moon. When she was brought into prison it is revealed that she is stronger than the highest ranking werewolf that was imprisoned there and she was able to kill a strong pureblood vampire despite not relying on the moons power, being the result of being an experienced fighter with her human nature allowing her to adapt to any situation for an advantage over stronger enemies. Appears to have feelings of companionship for Hiro. Much to her embarrassment she has \\"squishy\\" pads (some translations describe them as being a comforting soft feel) inside her paws, according to Hiro and one of his classmates. She also initially disliked Reiri due to their opposing natures, but gradually got along with the vampire. When she was helped by Reiri in the vampire kingdom she was temporarily turned into a hybrid of vampire and werewolf, although this didn't appear to have any other effect than to mask her presence to the other vampires. It was revealed that Riza is a virgin in her conversation with Reiri. She particularly enjoys fast vehicles, much to Hiro's horror when he's dragged along, despite this they're on friendly terms with each other and Riza actually teases Hiro the least out of all the girls. :In the Future, Riza is stated to have died from the bomb explosion that threw Hime into the future. Her name was renamed to \\"Liza Wildman\\" in the English dub. Weapons used: Metal Pole, Rifle. ; * : A female pureblood vampire, a vampire born from a vampire, who attends the same school as Hiro. She has long black hair, always dresses in a dark sailor fuku, and has idol status in her school. In the manga, there are many scenes showing her in black underwear, but in the anime those are reduced to panchira. Reirei made an attempt to get Hime's blood by using Hiro after she turn him into a lesser vampire. Though the plan failed and Hiro was cured, Hime spared Reiei's life as she had no relation to the vampire in the hospital. She was later banished from the vampire society by Kiniski after she helped Riza fight him, being hunted by the lesser vampires he sired for three days straight before they nearly kill her while burning down the abandoned church she was living in. But she was saved by Riza, Hiro, Hime, Flandre, Sherwood, Francesca, and Francette, having since become a freeloader at Hime's mansion. While she greatly detested Riza at first, Reirei eventually grew to respect the half- werewolf. Other than the blood from members of the Royal family, female virgins, and a cute guy within reason, she also enjoys drinking tomato juice. She enjoys eating Sawawa's meals and seems to be able to get just enough sustenance from food to allow her to survive for a short period on just a few drops of blood. This way she is able to use a small knife to get blood from her \\"lambs\\" at school in a \\"ritual\\" without needing to use her fangs or mind control to feed. Since it's only a few drops and most of the school idolizes her, they're willing to accommodate her \\"fetish\\" as a means to be closer to her than others while thinking she's only pretending to be a vampire. :As a pure-blood, besides superhuman strength, speed, and healing, Reirei possesses many abilities that include flight, break down into bats that fly off to another spot before reforming back into human form, siring lesser vampires, and memory alteration. Unlike lesser vampires, garlic and crosses are only irritating and sunlight only weakens her to point where she can't fly and brief fainting spells if exposed for too long. During attack in Hiro's dream it's indicated that too much direct exposure, especially when asleep, can be dangerous if not fatal. However, she is able to attend school during the day without any trouble as she uses frail health as an excuse to keep the length of exposure down. She cannot cross large bodies of water on her own as just being over on a bridge or boat severely drains her. For example, while in the possessed truck of a murderer she tells Riza that while baths and showers are fine, vampires can't handle large bodies of water. Death is almost guaranteed if stakes of white ash are driven into a vampire's heart, although Zepelli survived Kiniski's staking him due to the fact that the hospital it happened at was under his control and very skilled. She, like all vampires, still can't enter a private residence without an invitation, although she can drive everyone out by setting the place on fire. Also, she can't enter an Evil God's established territory, and will be pushed out if she's in an area that gets annexed by an Evil God's territory, possibly for a similar reason as she can't enter a residence uninvited. Although she was still able to enter the school when Naqua was using it, she wasn't able to enter Naqua's shrine, or either of the towns claimed by the Snake (school Riza investigated) or Rat (Hot Springs) Evil Gods. But she was able to enter a territory where Evil Gods were replaying a family's murder in an endless loop by holding onto Hiro who'd somehow pop in when Hime was in danger of dying. : At first, she greatly detests Riza but their relations change gradually for the better. : In the future, she saves Hime from the monster attacking her and was about to share the details about the bomb explosion nine years ago but is attacked and subsequently killed by the same monster. But Reirei lives long enough to look at the back of the painting Hiro hid an axe behind for answers as to how she was transported into the future. Weapons used: Wooden Stakes, Razor Sharp Fingernails. ; * : Hime's little sister, the third princess of the Royalty. Her hair color, eyes, and dress are similar to Hime's. She has the ability to freely control the man-eating plant Triffid, which she used in a failed attempt to kill Hime. She once harbored ill will toward Hime, but later reconciled, and has a big crush on Hiro and will almost do anything to make him her servant. After that she moved into a mansion on the hill opposite Hime's mansion. : In the future, an eighteen-year-old Sherwood, along with Sylvia, is the last remaining participant in the battle for the throne and is losing to Sylvia. She intends to entrust everything to Hime, but Hime declines and entrusts everything to Sherwood instead as she ends up becoming the winner by default after her older sisters' powers canceled each other out. Weapons used: None. ; * : The gynoid serving Sherwood. She dresses in a maid costume and wears spectacles. She is the sister machine of Flandre and has equal abilities, with the exception of a superior intellect. She obeys Sherwood's instructions without questions although she stops Sherwood whenever she will do something that will harm her. Excels in melee combat and can flick pellets at extremely high speed with her fingers. Weapons used: Broken Tree, Small Pin Balls. ; * : A giant panda revived by Sherwood's blood. Died when he was strangled by a tire that he was playing with at Sasanagi Zoo. (In the anime, he appeared to have died during Zeppeli's attack. He was only knocked out during that battle, and Sherwood realized this when she went to revive him. So in the anime he never died or was revived.) Sworn brothers with Can-can and Chou-chou (in reference to RoTK), the other two pandas in the zoo. It is unknown if the other two are blood warriors, but all three pandas are now living at Sherwood's residence. Similar to Hiro, Ryu-ryu's fur turns white when Sherwood is in danger, this causes him to be mistaken at times for a white bear; he is fairly intelligent as he realized that Sherwood was responsible for his resurrection and sought her out without any assistance. While he's only been seen fighting with his claws, in the manga he and the other two are crossing bladed pole weapons together at the end of the chapter. Weapons used: Panda Claws. ; * : Naqua is a spider goddess who protects Sasanaki city from rogue deities before her worshipers ceased the practice of human sacrifices, having since made her home in the basement of Hiro's school where she feeds on the students lured there in by a ghost story which she considers ideal payment in protecting the school itself. Hime allowed Naqua to do as she pleases, the spider blamed her for Riza and Reiri driving her out of Hiro's school as she attempted revenge by sending Hime and her servants back in time to Ice Age before moving to a school in a nearby town. But Naqua later aligns herself with Hime when an evil god she defeated ages ago invades her territory and she is too weak to fight him, teaching Hime the means to kill deities as a sign of trust. Naqua had since resided in a small shrine built by Flandre and Francesca near Hime's mansion and accepting different offering like sweets made by Sawawa. The shrine is revealed in the manga to have a stairway (in an alternate space) leading to a bridge she is building to connect the human world to the realm of Evil Gods (also said to be the world of dreams.), explaining to Hime that it has nothing to do with Phoenixes. She has the ability to summon large spiders as well as turn her head into spider legs. :After the end of the manga Princess Resurrection, she starred in her own spin-off manga titled Naqua-den where is she is reunited with her servant Taroumaru who concealed himself within the body of Tarou Kanda while dealing with the Aregami running rampant in Japan. Enemies Sylvia's Faction ; * (OVA) : A member of the Royalty and Hime's older sister, whom she was very close to despite making her sister hate her. She was captured by her former servant Kinishki to use for his own agenda of ruling the Monster Kingdom. She is shown wearing a dress while being blindfolded, gagged, and restrained by leather straps with a tap installed on her where blood can be collected for Kinishki's use. Despite this setup she is not in the least bit bothered, though she express personal dismay of not having the pleasure of personally killing Severin after enjoying the news of death. Sylvia is later freed by Micasa and rejoins the Royal War with Micasa as her new blood warrior. :In the future, Sylvia had killed Duken and nearly almost kills Sherwood when a time displaced Hime intervenes. She duels Hime but is interrupted by the mermaid who wounds Hime. Sylvia prepares to deal the final blow, but is stopped by an older and much more battle-hardened Hiro who spirits Hime to safety. It would later be revealed that Sylvia was secretly murdered by Emile and made into his half-immortal warrior. Once fully matured, Sylvia abandons her servants and absorbs the newly awakened Fuhito into her mind along with Hime and Hiro to settle things in a duel that ends with the sisters losing their phoenix power and rendered mortal. ; : A vampire duke living in a castle on the edge of the Monster Kingdom, referred as \\"Werewolf Killer Kiniski\\" for having killed over 200 werewolves. He was originally staked by Sylvia who recruited him as a half-immortal servant, only for him to betray her and hold her captive in his castle to use for his own agenda while feeding on her blood to prolong his life. Riza and Reiri interfered and, through the talk with Riza, it was revealed that he was the one responsible for banishing Reiri from vampire society by framing her with the crime of injuring Zeppeli, a fellow vampire. He later used sorcery in attempt to kill Hime with a curse, only her to break his spell and keep him from entering her mansion right before sunrise. Although not shown explicitly, it is assumed that he died due to the expiration of his blood powers. His shriveled corpse was later seen inside his castle. :Did not appear in the anime but his role is filled by Duke Dracul in the anime. ; * : Originally Severin's blood warrior, a silent young human girl with long black hair whom Severin made into a half- immortal after he killed her. While human like Hiro, she is enhanced by a parasitic bio-weapon implanted in her head that gives her heightened combat abilities and Witchblade like powers. Micasa is a subject of the Fly Man, joining him in order to save her terminally ill younger sister. She later becomes Sylvia's servant at the Fly Man's suggestion to prolong her life after Severin's death. ; : A gynoid, like Flandre and Francisca, created to serve Sylvia, imprisoned by Kiniski. A sister machine to Flandre, her appearance is that of an adult female in a maid costume. She uses a large drill, which replaced her destroyed left forearm as a weapon. She later joins forces with the Fly Man and Micasa to free her mistress. In the later manga chapters her large drill has been replaced with a forearm. She can only be seen in the 3rd OVA of the anime as a background character. Zeppeli's Faction ; * : A male vampire with dark skin, silver hair and a goatee. Owner of the Sasanagi Hospital which is the vampires' base. He pursues the blood of Hime too but prefers to execute plans behind the scenes. Because he had a cooperative relationship with Reiri, he became looked upon with hostility from the vampire society, too. ; * :Director of the Sasanagi Hospital, and a subordinate of Zeppeli. He is the mad scientist archetype and is trying to discover the secret to immortality. He noticed Hiro's immortality and tried to conduct brutal experiments on him. He was killed by Hime with a defibrillator but revived himself with the drug Trioxin. He was defeated once again when Flandre exploded a roomful of lime dust. ; * : A tall android. Unlike Flandre, who can only say \\"Fuga\\", Ciel is capable of normal conversation. In addition to that he also understands Flandre's words. He has memories of working in the deuterium mine of the kingdom some three years prior to the start of the series. While escaping, he was touched by the view of the sea and longed to live a free life. He happened to meet Flandre, while walking in town and helped with the upkeep of Hime's mansion. In the time he was being repaired by Flandre, he developed a relationship with her. However, he was in fact made by Zeppeli only ten days prior to the episode he featured in, and the twenty- seven years of memories he had, were implanted in him. He tried to capture Hime but was defeated by Sherwood and Francesca. He learned of his false life, and when Flandre was damaged and unable to be repaired, he decided to spare his own part to her. Then, in revenge, he went back to Zeppeli and self- destructed. Emile's Faction ; * : A member of the Royalty and one of Hime's older brothers. A youth with elegant looks who wears a decorative shirt. There is hostility between him and Hime, but he treasures their relationship and tries to keep it in balance. He can inflict a psychokinetic attack with just a glare, he is the only one so far that has this strange ability among the siblings of Royalty, but using it too often or too strongly severely taxes his health. It's also hinted that he can occasionally \\"see\\" the future, but how far, how accurate, and how many possible futures seen and the actions leading to them is unknown. Emile was murdered by Sledge after destroying Gilliam's train, and revived as Sylvia's blood warrior in an act that is considered taboo in the Phoenix clan. After being discovered, his ability no longer fatal to him while acting like a mindless automaton, Emile attempts to kill Hime with Keziah and Sledge killed in the process. Emile's spirit somehow transforms into an incomplete \\"adult mode phoenix\\". By increasing the energy of his spirit, he was able to appear as a figure surrounded by the same flames adult Royales use. He soon starts aiding his younger siblings, Hime and Sherwood. Before disappearing from Hime and Sherwood, he asks Sherwood to help Hime, and than tells Hime that she must inherit the throne, before disappearing for good. ; * : An android built by Frankenstien to support Emile, a diminutive non-human looking robot butler piloting a larger robot. Unlike the other robots Frankenstien created, due to Frankenstein taking a personal investment in Emile, Flanders is modified to override his Royalty-neutral directive with the exo-armor's eyes outfitted with photon cannons. In Chapter 56, Princess Destiny, it was noted that Flanders had broken down sometime ago, alluding to Emile's status as Sylvia's blood warrior serval as Flanders is programmed to self-destruct upon Emile's dead and to never harm any living member of the Royal Family save those who are dead, undead, or half-immortal. Flanders's exo-armor is later destroyed by Gillam, using its head module to launch an assault on Sasanaki before being destroyed. Flanders' actual body is later seen deactivated in Emile's room following his master's death ; * : A werewolf serving Emile. He smokes cigars and has four scars across his face. His father is Kadaria Bold. He and Riza's father were comrades in a past war and he respects Volg as a great warrior. Later in the chapter (Chapter 56, Princess Destiny), Keziah is killed by the converted Emile when he takes a deathblow meant for Hime. Hime tells Hiro she won't turn Keziah into a blood warrior as werewolves believe that the highest honor is to die in battle, and that the werewolf's honor would be tarnished if revived. Before dying, with Riza honoring it, he sees Hime and tells her that she reminds him of Emile. Riza honored his death. But to Riza's disgust, Keziah is forcefully resurrected by Emile as a Flame Warrior to pass something onto Madeleine before later being destroyed by Emile. ; Madeleine * : Known as the , she was a child who was held captive in a ghost ship, her flute music appears as SOS signals to other ships and thus draw them near for the evil within the ship to feed on their souls (Does this by turning invisible or 'phasing out' to anyone not on board or touching its hull, then 'appears' before the rushing rescue boat who then crashes into the ghost ship killing the crew). While she became human to be with her love, Madeleine was cursed to die the moment she utters a word which came to pass when Keziah retrieved her on Emilie's order and forced to speak to save his life before being revived as Emile's blood warrior. Her name is finally revealed after Sylvia takes her in after 'resurrecting' Emile. This is because all members of the royal family have a duty to protect endangered species (like mermaids) and Emile's blood wouldn't keep Madeleine alive anymore once he was resurrected. So Sylvia had Emile \\"give\\" Madeleine to her. ; * : A man with wings of indeterminate species who wears night vision goggles, first seen with Emile and others to witness Severin and Hime's duel, later in chapters with Emile. He later betrays Emile by killing him and letting Sylvia \\"save\\" his master by turning him into a blood warrior, only to be later killed by Emile once his actions were exposed before having a chance to explain how he considered his actions to be Emile's benefit. Severin's Faction ; * : Hime's older brother, the fifth prince, is an ambitious member of the Phoenix Tribe who aims for the throne. His appearance is that of a bish≈çnen with sharp eyes and blond hair, and he wears a black coat with feathers woven at the shoulder. Unlike his siblings, Severin is a fearful coward who abuses his power and spitefully breaks their family's taboos from converting his victims into immortal soldiers and using zombies to attack Hime on two occasions. In the aftermath of the second occasion, Serverin attempted to frame Hime of using zombies so he can prolong their fight to adulthood, only for Hime to settle things in a duel and killing him. ; : A butler-type android serving Severin, his characteristic bring a scar around his mechanical left eye. In the end, Franz self-destructed upon his master's death. Gilliam's Faction ; * (OVA) : Member of the royalty, Hime's older brother wearing all white. He first appeared in chapter 35, where he is seen attempting to kill Hime during the phenomena. He appeared at chapter 38 where he fired at the train which Hiro and Emile are on . He told Hime that the Professor had abandoned them and was letting Emile win. He wanted to blow the train up for the benefit of all and asked Hime which side she was on. He was shown to be skilled with the sword and will do whatever it takes to reach his goal. After the train incident he and Hime remained in a hostile, though somewhat more peaceful, relationship. His current target is apparently Duken. In the future, he was killed by Duken. Fretellus * (OVA) : An android serving Gilliam, he is a very large, powerfully built android who dresses in a tuxedo and wears a headgear with three lens on it. He was destroyed after Emile hurled Gilliam's cannon back to Gilliam. Gilliam later steals a Mark II version from the Professor. Sword Being : A living sword shown during the train arc, it is a long sabre and is capable of flight/at least some locomotion in the air. It is Gilliam's blood warrior. Normally it looks like a normal sword, however, after being broken by Hime's chainsaw, living tissue and an eye grew around it when Gilliam gave it blood. Bug : A giant arthropod monster that is the blood warrior under Gilliam. Gilliam attempted to use it to kill Emile in the train and it took the combined efforts of Keziah and Riza to defeat it. its head and legs bear a strong resemblance to the bugs from Starship Troopers. When Gilliam first poured it into the train car it resembled the \\"that\\" Hime killed in the Motel. Duken's Faction ; : The oldest member of the royalty and Riza's mortal enemy for using her to force her brother Wildman to attack Hime. Duken first appeared in chapter 44, where he is seen to be searching for Sylvia during the Sasanaki graveyard incident. His only visible clothing is a cloak that covers the lower part of his face and what seems to be a jumpsuit. While having taken part in the previous Throne War and assumed to be the survivor, he was actually killed by his older brother Fuhito who hid himself away to outlive his siblings while having a robot double of Duken created to a figurehead until he has fully healed himself. However, Sylvia learned of this and killed Duken. Franz : The android that serves Duken, build in the form of a dog instead of having a humanoid shape. ; * : Referred only as Wildman in the manga, in the anime his full name is revealed to be Lobo Wildman. A full- blooded werewolf warrior who respects and cares very much for his sister Riza, whom he raised after their father died. Originally Hime's servant, Wildman was forced to turn on her when Duken took an unsuspecting Riza hostage and died fighting Hime as she stabbed him in the head with her sword. Hime expresses respect for Wildman maintaining his sense of honor despite his betrayal, burying him on the manor grounds and revealing how his death occurred to Riza. Droid Army : An army of droids that serve Duken. They are shown to be armed with multiple weapons such as a flamethrower and harpoon-like claws. Assassins Monster assassins that were sent to kill Hime. ; :Alex :Karim :Sarome :Three werewolf blood warriors. In the manga, it is unknown to who sent them. In the anime, they are under Severin. ; :Appeared in \\"Princess Locked Room\\" (ÂØÜÂÆ§ÁéãÂ•≥). A nameless spider-like monster with eyes around its body referred to as \\"That\\" by Hime. In the manga, it enters a person and eats them from the inside, while in the anime it eats the person's soul. It's unknown who sent it in the manga version, while Zeppeli sent it in the anime. The anime version renames the creature \\"It\\". ; : :A warrior in a pharaoh mask. It led an army of mummies to attack Hime's residence. Planting a scout beforehand, they struck when Hime was weakened by a cold. Hiro, Flandre, and Riza struggled to defeat the mummy army. ; :As the name suggests, they are monsters with the features of a bat and spider. A large number are sent to attack Sherwood's residence. In the anime version the spiderbats are sent by Zeppeli. They are a homage to the Bat Rat Spider from the 1959 film The Angry Red Planet. ; :Caused everyone in the mansion to experience a nightmare which is reminiscent of the Akasabi Village events. Hime saw through it and returned to reality where she defeated the real enemy. ; :It clones the organism it stings, and attempts to substitute the original organism with the clone. It is said to come from a space meteor with \\"That\\". They are a homage to the Pod People from the film Body Snatchers. They cloned multiple weaker and less intelligent copies of Reiri and Riza while trying attack to Hime. One clone of Hime was also produced which, possessing Hime's noble traits, sacrificed herself to save the original. ; :A blob monster that attempted to get close to Hime by participating in a race in the form of Hiro. Does not appear in the manga. Others ; * :One of the fishmen race who appear to be a homage of the monster from Creature from the Black Lagoon. He is much bigger compared to humans and other mermen; his size can be compared to hills and buildings. The Merman lost to Riza in a duel. In the manga, he died after the duel but in the anime he is still living and fell in love with Riza. In the manga he was not given any name, but was named Poseidon in the anime. ; :The Headless Horseman appears at the Sasanagi Pass looking for his head. However, unknown to him, it was Zeppeli who took his head. The head was retrieved by Hiro and Riza. In the manga, the story started with Zeppeli taking the head, but in the anime it started with the race between Riza and the Horseman, with the head incident as a smaller sub-plot. He is renamed Knight of The Pass in the anime. ; * :The culprit of a series of violent murders targeting females that happened 40 years ago at Akasabi Village, a village that gave way to a dam project. At first he targeted women who supported or related to those who supported the dam as he felt it a betrayal for them to turn the village of their ancestors into a lake for profit. Hime and Hiro wandered to the now non-existent village during the witching hour to seek help in fixing their broken-down car. His appearance is that of a fat middle-aged man wearing a singlet and suspender pants, a paper bag with eye holes over his head and a large sickle as weapon. In the anime, he is the leader of the party that opposed the dam project and killed all who supported the project despite age and gender. Unlike the manga version, his anime version has a much larger inhuman build. He left such a strong impression in Hiro and Hime that his form is later used by the dream assailant. ; :A scientist with a fly head and a human body, he is likely a homage to the monster from the 1958 film The Fly. Trying to sell a biological weapon he developed to Hime, he traps her in a maze he constructed beneath the mansion but fails. He is also responsible for Mikasa's bio-weapon parasite. In Chapter 74 of the manga, it is found out that he used to be human, but to due an accident with a machine he was morphed into a monster. ; : Known as the \\"Professor\\", he once served Fuhito and created many things for the Royal Family, including the robot bodyguards and the Duken replica whom he consider all his children. While originally human, he became an emerged brain that uses the mansion as a body to act through. Normal Civilians ; * :The owner of a caf√© which Sawawa frequents as she loves the parfait the caf√© makes. A moustached, dandy looking man. In the manga, he only appeared in one frame in the background but in the anime he appeared a number of times.

He treats her to free parfaits, gives her lottery tickets, and even wanted to rename the caf√© \\"Sawawa\\", with his gifts becoming more elaborate each time.

A bespectacled otaku-like boy. Called \\"Buchi\\" by Hiro. Once stalked Reiri and found out she was a vampire, but that part of his memory was then erased by Reiri. He accompanies Hiro and Princess Sherwood on monster- hunting expeditions as a cameraman, showing some shock at the supernatural happenings, such as thinkinh the guides they hired are in costumes. He often gets Hiro to go with him to investigate rumors of supernatural happenings, which almost always turn out to be true. It is suggested that he has a crush on Francisca. In the anime he also secretly takes pictures of Hime, Sawawa, and Riza. He especially interested in the well-endowed maid Sawawa. He sneaks into the mansion with Yoshida and Murayama to find out the relationship between Hiro and the girls. ; :A security guard who enjoys hunting.

She was also a concert producer. She composed a number of French songs in the style of m√©lodies; for some years she lived in Paris, where she was a pupil, friend and possibly lover of Gabriel Faur√©. Subsequently, living in Berlin, she composed a German opera which was staged in Leipzig. On returning to England she created works for Rutland Boughton's Glastonbury Festivals. Biography She was born at 42 York Terrace, Regent's Park, London on 15 December 1862 (rather than in 1866 as is sometimes stated), the daughter of Vice Admiral Louis Symonds Tindal (1811‚Äì76) and Henrietta Maria O'Donel Whyte (1831/2‚Äì1917). Her grandfather was the judge Nicholas Conyngham Tindal. She seems to have been raised in London. On 14 April 1883 she married barrister and former footballer Frederick Brunning Maddison (1849‚Äì1907), at Christ Church, Lancaster Gate, London. They had two children, Diana Marion Adela and Noel Cecil Guy, born in 1886 and 1888 respectively. Her first published works date from 1882. Twelve Songs in 1895 marked the emergence of a distinctive style. Gabriel Faur√© From around 1894, Maddison and her husband played a major part in encouraging and facilitating Faur√©'s entry onto the London musical scene. Her husband was now working for a music publishing company, Metzler, which obtained a contract to publish Faur√©'s music during 1896‚Äì1901. She provided English translations of some of his m√©lodies, and of his choral work La naissance de V√©nus, Op. 29; Faur√© used the latter translation in 1898, when he conducted a choir of 400 at the Leeds Festival. Faur√© was a friend of the family and in 1896 vacationed at their residence in Saint-Lunaire, Brittany. She became Faur√©'s pupil, and he thought her a gifted composer. She composed a number of m√©lodies, setting the works of poets such as Sully Prudhomme, Copp√©e, Verlaine and Samain; in 1900 Faur√© told the latter that her treatment of his poem Hiver was masterly. During 1898 ‚Äì c. 1905, she lived in Paris without her husband; Faur√©'s biographer Robert Orledge believes there was a romantic liaison with Faur√©, who dedicated his Nocturne No. 7, Op. 74, to her in 1898; this piece was expressive of his feelings towards her, according to Orledge. Faur√© gave her the nocturne's manuscript; it is now in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. In Paris she was also acquainted with Delius, Debussy and Ravel, and produced performances of her own works and those of others. She hosted the first performance of Delius's opera Koanga in March 1899 at her residence there, attended by Prince Edmond de Polignac and the Princesse de Polignac. Faur√© was among the performers. From Paris she moved to Berlin, where she continued to produce concerts, and composed an opera, Der Talisman, which was staged in Leipzig in 1910. In Germany she started a lifelong friendship with Martha Mundt, the editor of a Berlin socialist journal. Born in 1872, Mundt came from K√∂nigsberg; she had studied sociology and economics there and in Berlin, Genoa and Rome. Music historian Sophie Fuller believes it is quite likely the relationship between the two women was a lesbian one. They left Germany for France, where Mundt obtained work with the Princesse de Polignac, and they moved on to London when World War I started. Their friends in England included Radclyffe Hall and Mabel Batten. Mundt returned to Berlin sometime during the war. Maddison moved to Glastonbury, Somerset and spent a number of years in the production of works for the Glastonbury Festivals of that era. These included the ballet The Children of Lir, which was subsequently staged in 1920 at the Old Vic. Her piano quintet, written in 1916, but first performed in 1920, was a success. She continued to compose opera and songs, and to produce concerts, into the 1920s. From the early 1920s, Martha Mundt lived in Geneva, having joined the secretariat of the International Labour Organization (ILO) as an information officer on the strength of the recommendation of leading German socialist Eduard Bernstein to the ILO director, Albert Thomas. Mundt became the ILO's officer dealing with employment issues for women and children, and the ILO's liaison with feminist organisations. She represented the ILO at a number of international congresses around Europe. Maddison often travelled to Geneva to visit Mundt there. Maddison died in Ealing, London in 1929. The scores for the compositions she created during her stays in Paris and Berlin, and for the music she created for the Glastonbury Festivals, seem to have been lost.

She was the younger sister of Jane Gordon, Duchess of Gordon. Biography Eglantine was the youngest daughter of Sir William Maxwell, 3rd Baronet, of Monreith, Wigtownshire. A boisterous hoyden in her youth, and a woman of violent temper in her maturer years, she was married on 4 September 1770 to Thomas Dunlop, son of John Dunlop of Dunlop and Frances Anna Wallace, the daughter and heiress of Sir Thomas Wallace (1702‚Äì1770) of Craigie, fifth and last baronet. On his grandfather's death in 1770, her husband inherited Craigie, took the surname Wallace, and assumed the style of a baronet; however, the property was deeply indebted, and in 1783 he was obliged to sell all that remained of Craigie. It would seem to have been shortly after this that Eglantine obtained a legal separation, on the ground, it is said, of her husband's cruelty. It is probable that the quarrel was due to pecuniary embarrassment. A little later Lady Wallace was herself summoned for assaulting a woman‚Äîapparently a humble companion‚Äîand was directed by the magistrate to compound the matter. Leaving Edinburgh, she seems to have settled in London, but upon her play The Whim (1795) being prohibited the stage by the licenser, she left England in disgust. In October 1789 she was arrested at Paris as an English agent, and narrowly escaped with her life. In 1792 she was in Brussels. There she contracted a friendship with General Charles Fran√ßois Dumouriez, whom in 1793 she entertained in London, where she seems to have been well received in society. She died at Munich on 28 March 1803, leaving two sons, the elder of whom was General [Sir] John Alexander Dunlop Agnew Wallace. Selected works She was author of: # Letter to a Friend, with a Poem called the Ghost of Werter, 1787, 4to. # Diamond cut Diamond, a Comedy [from the French], 1787, 8vo. # The Ton, a Comedy, 8vo, 1788; it was produced at Covent Garden on 8 April 1788 with a good cast, but, according to John Genest, was \\"very dull\\" and a dead failure. # The Conduct of the King of Prussia and General Dumouriez, 1793, 8vo; this was followed by a separately issued ‚ÄòSupplement.‚Äô # Cortes, a Tragedy (?). # The Whim, a Comedy, 1795, 8vo. # An Address to the People on Peace and Reform, 1798, 8vo.

Its region of operation includes \\"all the mountain national parks\\", with boundaries delineated by the border with the United States to the south, the eastern crest of the Rocky Mountains to the east, the crest of the Coast Mountains to the west, and the boreal forest to the north. It is adjacent to the Intermountain West Joint Venture to the south, the Pacific Coast Joint Venture to the west, and the Prairie Habitat Joint Venture to the east. Established in November 2003, it operates as part of the North American Bird Conservation Initiative. It also participates in the implementation of The Canadian Shorebird Plan, Partners in Flight, and Canada's Conservation Program for Seabirds and Waterbirds. It receives funding from the US federal government via the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, from Canadian government sources, from the private sector and from individuals. Its mandate is to conserve habitats for birds and wildlife primarily in the southern half of the British Columbia Interior, a region of at least with habitats ranging from \\"moist coniferous forests to desert\\". Ducks Unlimited Canada describes the area as \\"a landscape of varyings elevation and climate that has resulted in a tremendous diversity of habitat types, including desert, grasslands, shrub-steppe, riparian, wetlands, dry and moist coniferous forests, and alpine tundra\\". It supports 1.6 million breeding waterfowl of at least 26 species throughout the 20,000 km2 of lakes and wetlands in the region, and at least 373 bird species overall, including the entire population of eleven provincially endangered species: Brewer's sparrow (subspecies breweri), burrowing owl, ferruginous hawk, grasshopper sparrow, lark sparrow, prairie falcon, sage thrasher, Swainson's hawk, white-headed woodpecker, Williamson's sapsucker, and yellow-breasted chat.

Terminology A binary form (of degree n) is a homogeneous polynomial Œ£ ()an‚àíixn‚àíiyi = anxn \\\\+ ()an‚àí1xn‚àí1y + ... + a0yn. The group SL2(C) acts on these forms by taking x to ax + by and y to cx + dy. This induces an action on the space spanned by a0, ..., an and on the polynomials in these variables. An invariant is a polynomial in these n + 1 variables a0, ..., an that is invariant under this action. More generally a covariant is a polynomial in a0, ..., an, x, y that is invariant, so an invariant is a special case of a covariant where the variables x and y do not occur. More generally still, a simultaneous invariant is a polynomial in the coefficients of several different forms in x and y. In terms of representation theory, given any representation V of the group SL2(C) one can ask for the ring of invariant polynomials on V. Invariants of a binary form of degree n correspond to taking V to be the (n + 1)-dimensional irreducible representation, and covariants correspond to taking V to be the sum of the irreducible representations of dimensions 2 and n + 1\\\\. The invariants of a binary form form a graded algebra, and proved that this algebra is finitely generated if the base field is the complex numbers. Forms of degrees 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 are sometimes called quadrics, cubic, quartics, quintics, sextics, septics or septimics, octics or octavics, nonics, and decics or decimics. \\"Quantic\\" is an old name for a form of arbitrary degree. Forms in 1, 2, 3, 4, ... variables are called unary, binary, ternary, quaternary, ... forms. Examples A form f is itself a covariant of degree 1 and order n. The discriminant of a form is an invariant. The resultant of two forms is a simultaneous invariant of them. The Hessian covariant of a form is the determinant of the Hessian matrix :H(f) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 f}{\\\\partial x^2} & \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 f}{\\\\partial x\\\\,\\\\partial y} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 f}{\\\\partial y\\\\,\\\\partial x} & \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 f}{\\\\partial y^2} \\\\end{bmatrix}. It is a covariant of order 2n‚àí 4 and degree 2. The catalecticant is an invariant of degree n/2+1 of a binary form of even degree n. The canonizant is a covariant of degree and order (n+1)/2 of a binary form of odd degree n. The Jacobian : \\\\det \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x} & \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial y} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] \\\\frac{\\\\partial g}{\\\\partial x} & \\\\frac{\\\\partial g}{\\\\partial y} \\\\end{bmatrix} is a simultaneous invariant of two forms f, g. The ring of invariants The structure of the ring of invariants has been worked out for small degrees. gave tables of the numbers of generators of invariants and covariants for forms of degree up to 10, though the tables have a few minor errors for large degrees, mostly where a few invariants or covariants are omitted. Covariants of a binary linear form For linear forms ax + by the only invariants are constants. The algebra of covariants is generated by the form itself of degree 1 and order 1. Covariants of a binary quadric The algebra of invariants of the quadratic form ax2 \\\\+ 2bxy + cy2 is a polynomial algebra in 1 variable generated by the discriminant b2 ‚àí ac of degree 2. The algebra of covariants is a polynomial algebra in 2 variables generated by the discriminant together with the form f itself (of degree 1 and order 2). Covariants of a binary cubic The algebra of invariants of the cubic form ax3 \\\\+ 3bx2y + 3cxy2 \\\\+ dy3 is a polynomial algebra in 1 variable generated by the discriminant D = 3b2c2 \\\\+ 6abcd ‚àí 4b3d ‚àí 4c3a ‚àí a2d2 of degree 4. The algebra of covariants is generated by the discriminant, the form itself (degree 1, order 3), the Hessian H (degree 2, order 2) and a covariant T of degree 3 and order 3. They are related by the syzygy 4H3=Df2-T2 of degree 6 and order 6. Covariants of a binary quartic The algebra of invariants of a quartic form is generated by invariants i, j of degrees 2, 3. This ring is naturally isomorphic to the ring of modular forms of level 1, with the two generators corresponding to the Eisenstein series E4 and E6. The algebra of covariants is generated by these two invariants together with the form f of degree 1 and order 4, the Hessian H of degree 2 and order 4, and a covariant T of degree 3 and order 6. They are related by a syzygy of degree 6 and order 12. Covariants of a binary quintic The algebra of invariants of a quintic form was found by Sylvester and is generated by invariants of degree 4, 8, 12, 18. The generators of degrees 4, 8, 12 generate a polynomial ring, which contains the square of Hermite's skew invariant of degree 18. The invariants are rather complicated to write out explicitly: Sylvester showed that the generators of degrees 4, 8, 12, 18 have 12, 59, 228, and 848 terms often with very large coefficients. The ring of covariants is generated by 23 covariants, one of which is the canonizant of degree 3 and order 3. Covariants of a binary sextic The algebra of invariants of a sextic form is generated by invariants of degree 2, 4, 6, 10, 15. The generators of degrees 2, 4, 6, 10 generate a polynomial ring, which contains the square of the generator of degree 15. The ring of covariants is generated by 26 covariants. The ring of invariants is closely related to the moduli space of curves of genus 2, because such a curve can be represented as a double cover of the projective line branched at 6 points, and the 6 points can be taken as the roots of a binary sextic. Covariants of a binary septic The ring of invariants of binary septics is anomalous and has caused several published errors. Cayley claimed incorrectly that the ring of invariants is not finitely generated. gave lower bounds of 26 and 124 for the number of generators of the ring of invariants and the ring of covariants and observed that an unproved \\"fundamental postulate\\" would imply that equality holds. However showed that Sylvester's numbers are not equal to the numbers of generators, which are 30 for the ring of invariants and at least 130 for the ring of covariants, so Sylvester's fundamental postulate is wrong. and showed that the algebra of invariants of a degree 7 form is generated by a set with 1 invariant of degree 4, 3 of degree 8, 6 of degree 12, 4 of degree 14, 2 of degree 16, 9 of degree 18, and one of each of the degrees 20, 22, 26, 30. gives 147 generators for the ring of covariants. Covariants of a binary octavic showed that the ring of invariants of a degree 8 form is generated by 9 invariants of degrees 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and the ring of covariants is generated by 69 covariants. August von Gall () and confirmed the generators for the ring of invariants and showed that the ideal of relations between them is generated by elements of degrees 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. Covariants of a binary nonic showed that the algebra of invariants of a degree 9 form is generated by 92 invariants. Cr√∂ni, Hagedorn, and BrouwerBrouwer, Invariants and covariants of quantics computed 476 covariants, and Lercier & Olive showed that this list is complete. Covariants of a binary decimic Sylvester stated that the ring of invariants of binary decics is generated by 104 invariants the ring of covariants by 475 covariants; his list is to be correct for degrees up to 16 but wrong for higher degrees. showed that the algebra of invariants of a degree 10 form is generated by 106 invariants. Hagedorn and Brouwer computed 510 covariants, and Lercier & Olive showed that this list is complete. Covariants of a binary undecimic The ring of invariants of binary forms of degree 11 is complicated and has not yet been described explicitly. Covariants of a binary duodecimic For forms of degree 12 found that in degrees up to 14 there are 109 basic invariants. There are at least 4 more in higher degrees. The number of basic covariants is at least 989. The number of generators for invariants and covariants of binary forms can be found in and , respectively. Invariants of several binary forms The covariants of a binary form are essentially the same as joint invariants of a binary form and a binary linear form. More generally, on can ask for the joint invariants (and covariants) of any collection of binary forms. Some cases that have been studied are listed below. Covariants of two linear forms There are 1 basic invariant and 3 basic covariants. Covariants of a linear form and a quadratic There are 2 basic invariants and 5 basic covariants. Covariants of a linear form and a cubic There are 4 basic invariants (essentially the covariants of a cubic) and 13 basic covariants. Covariants of a linear form and a quartic There are 5 basic invariants (essentially the basic covariants of a quartic) and 20 basic covariants. Covariants of a linear form and a quintic There are 23 basic invariants (essentially the basic covariants of a quintic) and 94 basic covariants. Covariants of a linear form and a quantic Covariants of several linear forms The ring of invariants of n linear forms is generated by n(n‚Äì1)/2 invariants of degree 2. The ring of covariants of n linear forms is essentially the same as the ring of invariants of n+1 linear forms. Covariants of two quadratics There are 3 basic invariants and 6 basic covariants. Covariants of two quadratics and a linear form Covariants of several linear and quadratic forms The ring of invariants of a sum of m linear forms and n quadratic forms is generated by m(m‚Äì1)/2 + n(n+1)/2 generators in degree 2, nm (m+1)/2 + n(n‚Äì1)(n‚Äì2)/6 in degree 3, and m(m+1)n(n ‚Äì1)/4 in degree 4. For the number of generators of the ring of covariants, change m to m+1. Covariants of a quadratic and a cubic There are 5 basic invariants and 15 basic covariants Covariants of a quadratic and a quartic There are 6 basic invariants and 18 basic covariants Covariants of a quadratic and a quintic There are 29 basic invariants and 92 basic covariants Covariants of a cubic and a quartic There are 20 basic invariants and 63 basic covariants Covariants of two quartics There are 8 basic invariants (3 of degree 2, 4 of degree 3, and 1 of degree 4) and 28 basic covariants. (Gordan gave 30 covariants, but Sylvester showed that two of these are reducible.) Covariants of many cubics or quartics The numbers of generators of invariants or covariants were given by .

Listed at , 170 lb., he batted left-handed and threw right-handed. Moisan was the son of William J. and Beatrice A. (Currier) Moisan. He was born in Bradford, Massachusetts, and grew up in Newton, New Hampshire. In his youth he was interested in baseball, and aspired to become a major leaguer. He graduated at Sanborn Seminary, Kingston, and went on to attend McIntosh Business College before entering military service in December 1943. A decorated veteran of World War II, Moisan was stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia, and then Fort Bragg, North Carolina, before going overseas with Company G of the 398th Infantry Regiment, 100th Infantry Division. As a technician fifth grade, he served in France in 1944, and was part of the Allied advance into Germany in May 1945, earning the Silver Star at Jagstfeld. He also received the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, Combat Infantryman Badge, and battle ribbons with two stars. After being captured by the German forces and as a prisoner of war, Moisan endured a 32-day forced march across Germany into Austria. He suffered frozen feet and his weight dropped from 185 pounds to just 95 pounds. When he was discharged in December 1945, his feet were so tender that he was unable to cope with the infield work required around first base, his normal position, but still wanted to pursue a career in professional baseball. Following his military discharge, Moisan signed with the Chicago Cubs organization as a free agent in the spring of 1946. Due to the nature of his injury and his inability to remain as a first baseman, he had the Cubs' support when he made the decision to transition to a pitcher. Basically a knuckleballer, he also was used in pinch-hitting duties. In his professional debut, Moisan posted a combined record of 15‚Äì12 and a 3.11 earned run average in 36 games while pitching in the PONY and Tri-State leagues. He would spend the next six years in the minor leagues before gaining a promotion to the majors with the 1953 Cubs. In three relief appearances, he allowed three earned runs on five hits and two walks while striking out one batter in 5.0 innings of work. Moisan's one strikeout came against the great Stan Musial. He did not have a decision.Retrosheet.com ‚Äì Major league statistics Moisan continued pitching in the minors until 1956. His most productive years came in the Pacific League with the PCL Los Angeles Angels, averaging for them 12 wins per season from 1950 to 1953, with a career-high 16 wins in 1952. In ten minor league seasons, he had a 98‚Äì96 record with a 3.81 ERA in 329 games, 135 as a starter. A .222 lifetime hitter, he enjoyed his best season in 1953, posting career numbers in average (.284), runs (15), hits (40), home runs (four), RBI (23), OBP (.327) and SLG (.418). During his time with the Los Angeles Angels he was once the roommate of actor and professional athlete Chuck Connors. Following his playing retirement, Moisan remained involved with baseball for a significant number of years, mainly coaching teams near his home in New Hampshire. He also served as the nuclear materials manager at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, retiring in 1985. Moisan died in Brentwood, New Hampshire, at the age of 84.

OIC member states reaffirmed their commitment to respect of sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of the Republic of Azerbaijan calling for further diplomatic and peaceful efforts of Armenia and Azerbaijan to resolve the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, reiterating destructive influence of the policy of Armenia on the OSCE peace process. Resolution also called on the UN Security Council to recognize the fact of aggression against the Republic of Azerbaijan, to take the appropriate steps under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to ensure adherence of Armenia with UN SC resolutions and take coordinated actions on the issue at the United Nations. All states were urged not to provide any military supplies and equipment to Armenia with the purpose of depriving it from any opportunity to escalate the conflict and \\"continue the occupation of the Azerbaijani territories\\" and not allow any transit of weaponry to Armenia through their territories. The resolution expressed full support of OIC member states for the three principles of the settlement of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan from statement of the OSCE Chairman-in-Office at the 1996 Lisbon OSCE Summit, \\"territorial integrity of the Republic of Armenia and the Republic of Azerbaijan, highest degree of self-rule of the Nagorno-Karabakh region within Azerbaijan and guaranteed security for this region and its whole population\\". OIC resolution concluded that Azerbaijan has the right for appropriate compensation with regard to damages it suffered as a result of the conflict and puts the responsibility for the compensation of these damages on Armenia. OIC reiterated its full support to the people of Azerbaijan to defend their country and achieve the restoration of complete sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan at the UN General Assembly.

In Brazil, Portugal and lusophone culture, he is known as Pedro Malasartes. Origin The origin of this character is present in the medieval Spanish legends. The oldest documented reference was found in the late 12th century, in an Aragonese paper, in which a character is named \\"Pedro de Urdemalas\\". First appearance in literature The first literary mention is located in the book Libro del paso honroso, by Suero de Qui√±ones, possibly written in 1440. Shortly after, new references are found in theatrical authors about this character, where he becomes a prototype of a ruffian in several entremeses (interludes). Thus, Pedro de Urdemales takes part in works of Juan del Encina, Lucas Fern√°ndez, Lope de Rueda and Juan de Timoneda. Miguel de Cervantes, author of Don Quixote, wrote a full-length comedy in verse based on the character, and entitled Pedro de Urdemalas. In 1615, it was published in the collection Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses (Eight Plays and Eight Interludes), and can be read online, and has been translated into English several times.

Two kilometres to the east, is the village of Drei Annen Hohne that, like Schierke, is part of the borough of Wernigerode. The Brocken Railway, an important heritage line, runs past the rocks immediately to the south, below a granite quarry. The rocks of the Trudenstein are composed of granite and their summit lies at an elevation of 671 m.  Tourism  The Trudenstein is a popular hiking destination that is easily reached from Drei Annen Hohne on marked trails. The summit of the rock formation has been made accessible to the general public using ladders. From the top there is a commanding view of large parts of the East and South Harz. In good weather, the nearby Wurmberg mountain, the villages of Schierke and Elend and the St√∂berhai mountain, 15 kilometres away, may be seen. The Trudenstein is No. 17 in the system of checkpoints that form the Harzer Wandernadel hiking network.

Alberdi, Juan Mar√≠a Guti√©rrez and Esteban Echeverr√≠a, the Sal√≥n Literario, the beginning of the Generation of '37. Biography He started his schooling in Montevideo, but his family moved to the city of Santa Fe in Argentina during the Portuguese occupation. He finished his secondary schooling at the Monserrat School in C√≥rdoba, where he started his studies on art and painting. After the war with Brazil, he returned to Montevideo, where he founded a school and published a book for the teaching of reading. He moved to Buenos Aires in 1830, and began studying law at the University of Buenos Aires, but did not finish. He studied painting with various renowned artists. The following year, he opened a bookstore, \\"Librer√≠a Argentina\\". In the back room, a new literary club, the Sal√≥n Literario (\\"Literary meeting room\\") started meeting in 1835. The regular members to the Sal√≥n were youths interested in culture, politics and the scientific progress: Miguel Can√©, Juan Bautista Alberdi, Juan Mar√≠a Guti√©rrez, Esteban Echeverr√≠a, and Vicente Fidel L√≥pez. Their meetings at the beginning discussed literature, arts and fashion, influenced by the ascendancy of romanticism in Europe at the time. They also discussed politics and culture, subjects that later became the core of their meetings. In 1837, Echeverr√≠a founded the Asociaci√≥n de Mayo, at the back room of his store. The meeting was first viewed favorably by top functionaries of the Rosas government, even though they were considered suspicious by the Sociedad Popular Restauradora (Rosas' government's political arm). In the same year, the French blockade of the R√≠o de la Plata started, which first for cultural reasons, then political, defined them as anti-Rosas. The threats of the para-military group, the Mazorca, Sastre did not flee to Montevideo, as several of his friends had done. The government's displeasure and the stopping of imports from France caused the bankruptcy of his bookstore. In 1840, Sastre published a novel, Cartas a Germania. With his shop gone, he retired to the nearby town of San Fernando, where he opened a school in 1842. There he conceived and wrote El Tempe Argentino, his main work as a self-taught naturalist. It was a study more literary than scientific on the flora, fauna and geography of the Paran√° Delta, illustrated with engravings made by the author himself. Besides observations on flora and fauna, it contained studies on the insects, mushrooms and ferns of the region, a novelty at the time. After a visit to his school by members of the paramilitary Mazorca, he left for Santa Fe and later to Entre R√≠os, where in 1849, he founded the newspaper El Sudamericano. The following year, Governor Urquiza named him Inspector General of schools and director of the official newspaper El Federal. After the Battle of Caseros, which deposed Rosas, he returned to Buenos Aires, where he was named director of the public library. For his sympathies with the Urquiza government, in 1853 he was released from the post. He returned to Entre R√≠os, where he became Inspector General of schools of the Argentine Confederation. He also wrote for several newspapers and published a treatise on spelling, Ortograf√≠a Completa, and another one on grammar, Lecciones de Gram√°tica. After the Battle of Pav√≥n during the Argentine Civil Wars, he continued working as the director of schools for the nation. In 1865, he was named director of the Teacher's School in Entre R√≠os. His last public post was as member of the national Council on Education, where he worked until his death. Sastre died in Buenos Aires in February 1887. The town of Sastre, in Santa Fe Province, street names in several Argentine cities and a school on the Reconquista River, in the town of Tigre, are named after him.

Prior to passage of the bill, China was subject to an annual review by Congress of China's trade status with the United States. Since 1980, the president has had to issue annual waivers to trade with China. The act removed the review, eased some trade barriers, and facilitated China's entry into the WTO.U.S.-China Relations Act of 2000. Govtrack.us. Accessed May 5, 2012. China became a member of WTO on December 11, 2001, and its permanent normal trade relations status with the US was made permanent on December 27, 2001.  Background  China and the United States are some of world's largest economies, ranked 1st and 2nd, in terms of GDP (PPP). China as the world's largest exporter and the United States as the world's largest importer. They have so far been important pillars for the global economy. Formal diplomatic relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China were not established until 1979, and even afterwards, trade relations were hampered by the high tariff rates of the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Tariff Act of 1930. After the two governments settled asset claims dating from the Korean War in 1950, Congress temporarily granted China most favored nation status in 1980. However, Chinese-American trade was still hindered by the Jackson‚ÄìVanik amendment of 1974, which made trade with the United States contingent on certain human rights metrics. The Jackson‚ÄìVanik amendment enabled the president to issue an annual waiver, which were issued from 1980. However, this requirement was inconsistent with the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) that prohibit discrimination of members, so the United States opposed China's membership of WTO. By 1984, the United States had become China's third-largest trading partner, and China became America's 14th largest. However, the annual renewal of China's MFN status was constantly challenged by anti-Chinese pressure groups during US congressional hearings. For example, U.S. imports from China almost doubled within five years from $51.5 billion in 1996 to $102 billion in 2001. The American textile industry lobbied Congress for, and received, tariffs on Chinese textiles according to the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. In reaction to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests' suppression, the Bush I administration and Congress imposed administrative and legal constraints on investment, exports, and other trade relations with China. Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin holding a joint press conference at the White House, October 29, 1997 In 1991, China only accounted for 1% of total imports to the United States. The Clinton presidency from 1992 started with an executive order (128590) that linked renewal of China's MFN status with seven human rights conditions, including \\"preservation of Tibetan indigenous religion and culture\\" and \\"access to prisons for international human rights organizations\\"Clinton reversed this position a year later. Other challenges to Sino-American relations in this decade included the Cox Committee investigations against supposed nonprofit involvement in \\"promoting communism\\", the persecution of Taiwanese-American scientist Wen Ho Lee for unproven allegations of espionage for the PRC, and the 1999 United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. But relations warmed after the September 2001 initiation of the War on Terror. For many years, China was the most important country which required an annual waiver to maintain free trade status. The waiver for the PRC had been in effect since 1980. Every year between 1989 and 1999, legislation was introduced in Congress to disapprove the President's waiver. The legislation had sought to tie free trade with China to meeting certain human rights conditions that go beyond freedom of emigration. All such attempted legislation failed to pass. The requirement of an annual waiver was inconsistent with the rules of the World Trade Organization, and for the PRC to join the WTO, Congressional action was needed to grant permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) to China. This was accomplished in 2000 with the United States‚ÄìChina Relations Act of 2000, allowing China to join WTO in 2001. China's most favoured nation (MFN) status was made permanent on December 27, 2001. President Bill Clinton in 2000 pushed Congress to approve the U.S.-China trade agreement and China's accession to the WTO, saying that more trade with China would advance America's economic interests: \\"Economically, this agreement is the equivalent of a one-way street. It requires China to open its markets‚Äîwith a fifth of the world‚Äôs population, potentially the biggest markets in the world‚Äîto both our products and services in unprecedented new ways,\\" said Clinton. In a speech in 2000, Clinton reiterated his hopes: As a new member, China agreed to rapidly lower import tariffs and open its markets, although many trade officials doubted it would stand by those promises. China did cut tariffs after it joined the WTO, but it nonetheless continued to steal U.S. intellectual property (IP) and forced American companies to transfer technology to access the Chinese market, which were violations of WTO rules.\\"Accession has brought change to China and WTO\\", New York Times, Nov. 7, 2005  Impact  U.S. trade deficit (in billions, goods and services) by country in 2014 When President Barack Obama met with Chinese President Hu Jintao in 2011, officials were concerned that China was not acting in the free trade spirit it agreed to when it joined the WTO 10 years earlier. They proclaimed that China was still restricting foreign investment, avoiding national treatment of foreign firms, failing to protect intellectual property rights, and distorting trade with its government subsidies.\\"Wisconsin firm learns ups and downs of doing business in China\\", Washington Post, Feb. 26, 2011 There were also complaints by various lawmakers who wanted the administration to act against what they said was China's manipulating its currency, worried that it would allow China to underprice its exports and put American and other nations' manufacturing at a great disadvantage.\\"Time to stand up to China on trade\\", Washington Post, Sept. 15, 2010 The U.S.-China Business Council in 2014 said that China was restricting investment in more than 100 industrial sectors, including agriculture, petrochemicals and health services, while the U.S. was restricting investment outright in just five sectors.\\"U.S. companies feel a chill in China, even as many still rake in profits\\", Washington Post, July 4, 2014 A number of senators and congressmen wanted the White House to place tariffs on some of the underpriced Chinese imports, stating that if the administration wouldn't do so, they threatened to mandate some tariffs on their own.

Arnold Berleant was born in Buffalo, New York. He received his advanced musical education at the Eastman School of Music and his doctorate in philosophy at the State University of New York at Buffalo. He is Professor of Philosophy (Emeritus) at Long Island University, former Secretary-General and Past President of the International Association of Aesthetics, and former Secretary-Treasurer of the American Society for Aesthetics. His books and articles in philosophy focus on aesthetics, environmental aesthetics, and ethics. Arnold Berleant is the founding editor of Contemporary Aesthetics, an international on-line journal of contemporary aesthetic theory, research, and application. Life and work As a philosopher Berleant has written on important aspects of both aesthetic theory and the arts. These include ontological and metaphysical issues, basic theoretical questions such as appreciation and aesthetic experience, and explorations of music, architecture, painting and literature.Renee Conroy, ‚ÄúBerleant Review,‚Äù (Philadelphia, PA: American Society for Aesthetics, Eastern Division, April 2006). His first book, The Aesthetic Field: A Phenomenology of Aesthetic Experience (1970), established the concept of the aesthetic field as a contextual framework within which questions in aesthetics and the arts can be most fully illuminated. Much of his subsequent work has focused on environmental aesthetics, attending both to general issues and to specific kinds of environment. The aesthetics of environment is a theme that he has elaborated and extended in much of his writing.Cheng Xiangzhan, ‚ÄúEnvironmental Aesthetics and Ecological Aesthetics: Arnold Berleant‚Äôs Impact on Ecological Aesthetics in China,‚Äù Sztuka i Filozofia-Special Issue (forthcoming). In Art and Engagement (1991), Berleant exemplified the usefulness of the concept of the aesthetic field by applying it to a range of arts ‚Äì landscape painting, architecture and environmental design, literature, music, dance, and film.American Society for Aesthetics, Summer 1991. p. 9. Emerging from these original studies was the recognition that the different arts evoke experiences with their own claims to reality. Moreover, these experiences exhibit an intense, active perceptual involvement that he calls ‚Äúaesthetic engagement,‚Äù which belies the traditional claim of aesthetic disinterestedness. The innovative concept of engagement leads to new perspectives on a variety of traditional esthetic topics, including metaphorical language, urban design, music, and metaphysics, and opens less traditional topics, such as virtual reality and social interaction to aesthetic analysis. The body of Berleant‚Äôs work challenges the traditional view of philosophical aesthetics, which posits ‚Äúdisinterestedness‚Äù as foundational in aesthetic experience. Berleant draws upon both phenomenology and pragmatism for an opposing theory of aesthetic perception based on the notion of engagement.M.

At the age of seventeen, Mays co-directed and produced his own short film, aided by producer Todd Black, Gary Martin of Sony Pictures and others. Mays is a nephew of Stanley \\"Tookie\\" Williams, the notorious founder of the Crips gang. Film career Sony Pictures, Kodak Films, Todd Black, John Singleton, and Denzel Washington, all have played an important role in Mr. Mays‚Äô productions. His film entitled Trouble aimed to shed light on the African American and Latin American (Black vs. Brown) tension in South Central Los Angeles; the place where young Mays was reared. The New York Times found Mr. Mays‚Äô story to be so compelling that they printed a front page article, ‚ÄúBased on a true story,‚Äù telling May's story and accomplishments. Cash Money Records artist Glasses Malone announced he would be executive producing his first short film titled The Division, which will feature the rapper as a drug kingpin in Los Angeles. \\"The Division\\", a Cash Money Records Film, was written by Charles Penniman and Malcolm Mays and will be directed by Max Albert, co- founder of Albert Mason Media. Mays starred in the 2013 picture Life of a King, co-starring alongside Cuba Gooding Jr.. The film premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival and Mays was hailed by Variety as a natural and a highlight. Mays was cited in an August 9, 2013 interview of Cuba Gooding Jr. in the Huffington Post as part of the \\"next generation\\" of African-American actors. Millennium Entertainment has acquired all U.S. rights to the film. Mays starred as Gabe in the 2015 sports drama film Southpaw directed by Antoine Fuqua and written by Kurt Sutter. The film stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Forest Whitaker, and Rachel McAdams. The film was released on July 24, 2015, by The Weinstein Company. Mays had been cast as a series regular in FX‚Äôs drama pilot Snowfall, about the beginnings of the crack cocaine epidemic in Los Angeles in the 80‚Äôs. Co-written by John Singleton and Eric Amadio and directed by Singleton, Snowfall is set against the infancy of the epidemic and its ultimate radical impact on the culture as we know it. Mays will play Kevin Hamilton , Franklin‚Äôs (Damson Idris) best friend since childhood. Music career Malcolm Mays started playing piano at age eleven and is the self- proclaimed writer of music heavily influenced by 90's R&B; and 18th century poetry. Mays cites broad influences from music, art and film. Influences cited by Mays as inspirations include music from Eric Dolphy and John Coltrane to Rachmaninov and Beethoven, paintings of Caravaggio and Michelangelo, performers such as Sinatra, Prince, Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones, and the poetry of John Keats & James Baldwin. Mays has also cited the voice of Nina Simone and the readings of Maya Angelou and acts such as The Yardbirds, Cream and Jimi Hendrix as major influences. In 2011, Mays linked up with producers like Skiii Team who is known to have worked with Hollywood Holt, Mikey Rocks of The Cool Kids to produce the tracks for his initial release. Mays released his own self-produced tracks titled \\"Dichotomy\\" in 2013 and \\"Ruthless\\" in 2015. Mays also produced and directed the music videos for each of the tracks, releasing the video for \\"Ruthless\\" following the release of the film Southpaw. Both the songs and the videos were received with rave reviews by critics. After released of the second track, \\"Ruthless\\". Hip-Hop blog This Song Slaps, cited \\"Malcolm Mays is one of the most under-appreciated hip hop artists around today. He possesses a flow unmatched, dense lyrical content, and a sense of melody that‚Äôs truly uncommon within the world of hip hop music.\\" Mass Appeal stated of the Mays production of the film for the song \\"Dichotomy, \\"The video opens with a scene reminiscent of a biblical baptism before cutting to a ballet-esque twerk session. Throughout the video, Malcolm pauses to reflect on his past, but keeps getting distracted by matters of a more physical nature... Don‚Äôt get too distracted while watching the video, or you might miss out on depth of Malcolm Mays‚Äô lyrical content. Lines like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to live like you, but the truth is, Lord, you had some daddy issues too,‚Äù show that Mays talents extend outside of the world of film.\\" Will.i.am said of the video and song, \\"its crazy fresh...

Of the approximately 1,000 screenplays The Black List has included since 2005, nearly a third have been later produced as theatrical films, including successful and award-winning examples such as Argo, American Hustle, Juno,Nicole Sperling, \\"The Black List: How Hollywood's Buzziest Scripts Get Their Juice\\", Entertainment Weekly, December 10, 2008.

The produced films have together grossed over $25 billion, and have been nominated for 241 Academy Awards and 205 Golden Globe Awards, winning 48 and 40, respectively. As of the 92nd Academy Awards, three of the last 10 best picture Oscars went to scripts featured on a previous Black List, as well as nine of the last 20 screenwriting Oscars (Original and Adapted Screenplays). In addition, writers whose scripts are listed often find that they are more readily hired for other jobs, even if their listed screenplays still have not been produced, such as Jim Rash and Nat Faxon, two of the writers of the Oscar-winning screenplay of The Descendants, who had an earlier screenplay make the list. Slate columnist David Haglund has written that the list's reputation as a champion for \\"beloved but challenging\\" works has been overstated, since \\"these are screenplays that are already making the Hollywood rounds. And while, as a rule, they have not yet been produced, many of them are already in production.\\"David Haglund, \\"The Mostly Dull-Sounding Screenplays on This Year‚Äôs 'Black List'\\", Slate, December 13, 2011.

History The Black List live script reading at ATX Television Festival 2018: Moderator Franklin Leonard, Matt Lauria, James Lafferty, Jason George, Katherine Willis, Taylor Dearden, Nick Wechsler, Tyrel Jackson Williams and Riley Scott The first Black List was compiled in 2005 by Franklin Leonard, at the time working as a development executive for Leonardo DiCaprio's production company, Appian Way Productions. He emailed about 75 fellow development executives and asked them to name the ten best unproduced screenplays they read that year. To thank them for participating, he compiled the list and sent it to the respondents. The name The Black List was a nod to his heritage as an African American man, and also as a subtle reference to the writers who were barred during the McCarthy era as part of the Hollywood blacklist. The screenplays to top The Black List, from 2005 to 2019 respectively, are: Things We Lost in the Fire; The Brigands of Rattleborge; Recount; The Beaver; The Muppet Man; College Republicans; The Imitation Game; Draft Day; Holland, Michigan; Catherine the Great; Bubbles; Blond Ambition; Ruin; Frat Boy Genius; and Move On. Structure The Black List tallies the number of \\"likes\\" various screenplays have been given by development executives. Screenplays are ranked based on how many likes each of them get. The most likes received by a single screenplay is The Imitation Game, with 133 upon topping the 2011 list; it went on to win the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

PSA operates 22 ports in 11 countries. However so far PSA has failed to make the port fully functional,Review port deal with PSA: Pakistan's navy chief bring in trade or make the necessary investment of US$525 million over the course of 5 years it initially agreed, which is now raising concerns amongst Pakistani and Chinese governments as the Gwadar Port was largely funded by the Chinese government. China provided up to US$198 million of the total US$248 million funding for phase one of the project.The games at Gwadar, The Deccan Chronicle, January 29th, 2010, By Arun Kumar Singh Chinese government interest to make Gwadar Port fully functional has been to gain a wider maritime supply route, especially for oil tanker shipment from Gulf, as shipment supply from Gwadar port can reach Eastern China through the Karakoram Highway connecting China and Pakistan, or from a possible pipeline connecting Gwadar and Kashgar. Constructing a Kashgar-Gwadar railway line is also being considered. Gwadar is just 400 km from the Strait of Hormuz, a major world oil supply line, and 1,500 km from Kashgar, China. This means oil shipment only need to travel a total distance of 2,000 km from the Strait of Hormuz to China, as opposed to 12,000 km of maritime distance from the Strait of Hormuz to the Port of Shanghai via the Strait of Malacca. PSA has so far declined to make any press comment on this controversy.Pakistan to seek more Chinese help for Gwadar port A fully operational Gwadar port will expand China's maritime trade links, possible naval presence in the Indian Ocean and possibly also reduce maritime volume heading towards China across the Malacca and Singapore. The government of Balochistan has initiated a challenge of port operation to PSA in Pakistan's Supreme Court.Pakistan court hears challenge to PSA port deal Pakistan chief of naval staff Admiral Noman Bashir, has called for the cancellation of the port operation agreement with PSA, and suggested passing the operations to the Chinese government.

It is of medieval origin, largely rebuilt at the beginning of the nineteenth century. History The St. Peter and St. Paul was built in the early 13th century on a site given by Barking Abbey. The original building was constructed with Kentish rag stone, brought across the River Thames. The North Chapel is described as \\"new\\" in a will of 1475, and the two bays separating the chancel and north chapel have moulded form centred arches, typical of late 15th century architecture. During the reformation the church was plundered and spoiled, and most of its treasures confiscated. With the aid of the Fanshawe family, the building was later restored and strengthened. A stone buttress was added to the outside of the east wall, which can still be seen. By 1770 the church was in a dangerous condition due to the state of the foundations of the tower, causing it to press on the west and south portions of the nave. Temporary repairs were carried out and plans made to rebuild the tower at a cost of ¬£1,176.5s. Before this could be done, however, the tower collapsed on the morning of the second Sunday in Advent in the year 1800, destroying the nave and south aisle. A service would normally have been taking place at the time, but fortunately for the congregation, the vicar was late arriving with the keys and they were still waiting outside. The whole church, except for chancel and north chapel had to be rebuilt. The new work was carried out in stone rubble, re-using the old material, and brown brick. The reconstruction was completed by 1805,. The new tower was built with a spire, since removed. The architect of the rebuilding was William Mason, who had his name carved boldly on the arch over the west door. Ian Nairn described Mason ‚Äôs version of the gothic revival style as \\"Marvellous nonsense\\" and \\"pure froth, without a care in the world\\". A peal of six bells was cast for the newly constructed tower in 1804 by Thomas Mears of Whitechapel. The tenor was inscribed with a long list names of trustees and others who had had a part in rebuilding the church, including that of the Reverend Henry Morice, vicar of Dagenham from 1801-7. In 1933 the bells were recast by Gillet and Johnston of Croydon and hung in a new timber frame. Five years later, two new bells were added, cast by John Taylor and Co. of Loughborough, to complete the octave. In 1841 a new gallery was added, and in 1844 an organ installed in the gallery where the village orchestra had once performed. By 1877 it was decided to lower the floor of the Nave by 15 inches - the reason the windows seem so high today At the same time the organ was moved to the chancel, the pulpit replaced and the entire church refurnished with deal benches. The church was re-roofed in 1913 and the spire removed in 1921. In 1938 electricity replaced the gas lamps, the organ pipes were placed in the gallery, and pumped by electricity, and the organ console enlarged. On 28 June 1954, the church was designated a Grade II* listed building. Present day The church continues to be active, meeting each Sunday at 10:30, as well as having a range of mid-week groups. The parish is within the Conservative Evangelical tradition of the Church of England. It has passed resolutions to reject the ordination of women, and receives alternative episcopal oversight from the Bishop of Maidstone (currently Rod Thomas).

It was used as an anti-aircraft gun as well as a field piece. It originated as the 3-inch gun M1913, which was soon modified to the 3-inch gun M1916, which was later altered to the subject weapon.Williford, pp. 80‚Äì83 History This weapon originated with the acquisition in 1912 of a 75 mm gun designed by Col. Deport of the French Army. The US Army wished to examine and adopt a split-trail carriage, which would allow a higher elevation for indirect fire and dropping shells into trenches. This carriage type was used on the prototype 3-inch model of 1913, which was later designated the 3-inch gun M1916 after a major carriage redesign, prompted by field trials of the M1913. By early 1917 only 34 weapons had been completed; one source traces this to the Ordnance Department developing the weapon without input from the Field Artillery, compounded by a complex top carriage intended to allow 45 degrees of traverse.Hogg, pp. 48‚Äì50 Shortly after the American entry into World War I, the US Army decided to adopt French and British weapons, and modify their own weapons where possible to accept French or British ammunition. The M1916 was modified to a 75 mm bore, including alteration of existing weapons, permitting interchangeability of ammunition with French guns as the 75 mm gun M1916. The gun's hydro-spring recoil system consisted of an oil cylinder on top of the barrel and two spring cylinders underneath. It did not work at high elevation angles, and by early 1918 production of the US version of the French Canon de 75 mod√®le 1897 was emphasized. By the end of 1918, shortly after the war ended, only 251 weapons had been completed; 34 had been shipped to France but did not see action. A combination of a limited pre- war munitions industry, the short (19-month) US participation in the war, technical problems with large-scale production, and the ready availability of munitions in France led to this. In an attempt to resolve the recoil system problems, hydro-pneumatic recoil cylinders (using compressed air instead of springs) were designed by a French officer who had previously done this for Schneider-Creusot. In the US these were called the \\"St. Chamond\\" recuperator (touching off a flap in France over the US \\"stealing\\" military secrets), but only 60 of these were delivered by the end of 1919. Field trials in France showed that there was excessive play in the elevation and traverse mechanisms, making the gun very inaccurate, along with poor durability in cross-country movement. However, production continued postwar; eventually 810 barrels and 362 field carriages were delivered. The surplus of barrels led to the weapon's use for other purposes. Carriage orders were 300 in 1916, 340 in May 1917, and 400 to New York Air Brake in June 1917, totaling 1,040, with only 362 completed. Antiaircraft use 51 of these weapons were mounted on 2.5-ton White trucks for anti-aircraft (AA) use, designated the AA truck mount M1917. Some of these weapons reached France before the Armistice, the only US-made AA weapons to do so. These weapons saw some action prior to the war's end and shot down its first aircraft on May 18th, 1918 when soldiers of the U.S. 2nd Anti-Aircraft battery downed a German observation plane over no-man's land.https://sill-www.army.mil/firesbulletin/archives/2018/mar- apr/articles/ADA%20in%20WWII.pdf Prior to the commencement of this program, 50 AA truck mounts were shipped to France without guns as a stopgap, where French 75s were mounted on them. The maximum AA altitude was at 82¬∞ elevation, limited by a 20-second fuse. The low muzzle velocity and limited elevation and traverse of the AA mounting (31¬∞ to 82¬∞ elevation, 240¬∞ traverse) impaired the weapon's effectiveness. By 1940 the AA version of the weapon was no longer in active service, but a few were retained for training. Post-WWI use The Coast Artillery Corps deployed about 24 of these weapons on fixed pedestal mounts for land defense in the Panama Canal Zone in 1926, replacing the 4.7 inch howitzer M1913 in this role.Berhow, p. 78Handbook of the 4.7 inch Howitzer Materiel M1913 on Pedestal Mount M1915 An additional 100 barrels were acquired by the Coast Artillery for use in sub-caliber training alongside (or mounted on) large guns, such as the long-range barbette mounting of the 12-inch gun M1895. Used mostly for training purposes after World War I, the field artillery version of the gun remained in Army inventory as late as 1942.

He is from Summertown, Tennessee but moved to Sebastopol, California at a young age. Biography Meltzer was born in Summertown, Tennessee on September 26, 1979 to Alan and Lee Meltzer. The youngest of four siblings, Eli, his three sisters, mom, and dad moved to Sebastopol when he was 4 years old. When he graduated high school, Eli continued to pursue his musical goals and after making valuable connections in the local San Francisco Bay Area hip hop scene, he released his self-titled debut under the name Smoov-E. While he has since stated that the album isn't his personal favorite, it did establish him as a presence in the underground scene and featured other prominent artists such as Andre Nickatina, X-Raided, and Young Lay. He went on to release five more albums in the same fashion over the next several years including Keep Your Hand Out My Pocket (R.E.A.L. Records/2000), Confessions (R.E.A.L. Records/2001), Assuefatto (R.E.A.L. Records/2003), Long Duck Dong (R.E.A.L. Records/2005), and Sum Yung Girl (R.E.A.L. Records/2006). He continued to expand his audience with each consecutive record showing more lyrical prowess, vocal presence, and musical skill than its predecessor. Not only did E develop as an artist he also forged new working relationships with other Bay Area talents during this period including Dubee a.k.a. Sugawolf, Reek Daddy, and most notably the late Mac Dre. By 2007 Eli had released 6 full-length studio LPs and found his music straying from the synthesizers and drum machines that previously defined his sound. With Larry Dallas (R.E.A.L. Records/2007), Eli moved towards real instrumentation of his sounds playing live drums and piano on much of the album. By the time Rusty Squeezebox (R.E.A.L. Records/2008), was in production Eli had picked up playing the guitar just as both his grandfathers did before him. E's newfound skills with live instruments worked to his advantage while producing the western themed album which meshed the sounds of classic spaghetti western scores and his own unique style of rap. During the recording of Sum Yung Girl, Eli became increasingly interested in video production. After shooting a video for the song \\"Dream Girl\\" he decided to put out his next two albums with accompanying DVDs. These led to his next project, Simply Suggestive (R.E.A.L. Records/2009). The concept behind Simply Suggestive would be to shoot and perform 12 previously released Smoov-E songs live in different settings. Doing so would not only provide him a chance to create more videos but also showcase his ever-growing talent on live instruments ranging from guitar, piano, vintage synthesizers, banjos, turntables, and even a typewriter. A twelve track audio CD version was made available as well. In 2009 Eli released Mr. Biscuits (R.E.A.L. Records/2009), a compilation of B-sides and new tracks heavily laden with vintage synthesizers and drum machines. The album finally provided E with a chance to work with two of his longtime favorites Too Short and Brotha Lynch Hung. Following Mr. Biscuits came El Joy Del Sexo (R.E.A.L. Records/2010). The Latin themed record combined elements of live instruments and hand percussion with Giorgio Moroder-like synthesizers and drum sequencers. 2011 found Smoov E transitioning into new musical horizons as he signed a two-year record deal with I-Khan Distribution under the name \\"Eli\\". The only album that came from these years was titled \\"One Popular Guy\\" (I-Khan/2011), executive produced by Andre Nickatina. It took the artists love for early rock and roll and fused it with the rap production he's best known for. The release was backed by heavy touring and self-indulgence. After his deal with I-Khan, Eli began working on another Smoov E concept album. For the break dance themed record Smoov E enlisted the help of legendary producer Egyptian Lover for the title track. He collaborated with artist Nathan Gomez to create a 32-page, full cover, deluxe companion comic book for the EP \\"Rappin' Robot\\" (R.E.A.L. Records 2013) that preceded the full-length record simply entitled \\"Breakdance\\" (R.E.A.L. Records). In 2013 Smoov E set his sights on recording an album produced in the style of the 1980s horror director John Carpenter. On Jessica Gets Jealous (R.E.A.L. Records 2014) the unmistakable sounds and elements from classic slasher films complement the sharp lyrics as Smoov E courts yet another doomed mistress. Released in February 2014 on Rap Entering Another Level. In 2014 Smoov E releases another two albums. The first is an electro funk themed album aptly titled I Funked Her First. The second release of 2014 is a Top Gun themed album about the world's most famous legal hooker \\"Air Force Amy\\". After a liquor fueled performance at Carson City's Bunny Ranch, and a chance meeting with Air Force Amy, the two decided Amy needed a theme song. The result was a five-song EP in the style of Harold Faltermeyer's original score for Top Gun. This album glorifies the world of legal prostitution. 2015 brought the release of the hit single \\"Swerve\\", a collaboration with Dirt Nasty (n√©e Simon Rex). The music video was produced by Gary Ottonello. 2017 marked Meltzer's first major production credit with the release of Mickey Avalon's Teardrops On My Tombstone. This release would encourage him to further develop his producer credits.

A force of 44 Fleet Air Arm aircraft of the attacked a U-boat base south of the town and port of Harstad. The attack was directed at vessels in the natural harbour at Kilbotn. It lasted seven minutes and left two ships and a U-boat sunk. No Norwegians in the village of Kilbotn were killed or injured during or after the attack. Operation Judgement was the last air raid of the war in Europe.  Background  From 1939 to 1945 the German war effort made extensive use of the U-boat as a strategic weapon. From bases in Northern Norway U-boats sailed against the Allied convoys making for Russian ports in the Arctic Ocean. In autumn 1944, when German forces retreated from the extreme north, the U-boat base at Hammerfest was moved south to Kilbotn.Harald Isachsen (2009), Operation Judgement: Angrepet p√• <>, Kilbotn 4 Mai 1945, The base consisted of the depot-ship Black Watch, a former North-Sea passenger ferry, supported by a Norwegian cruiser converted by the Germans into a flak- ship, two barges fitted with anti-aircraft guns and numerous gun emplacements on the land round the harbour.Black Watch. Warsailors.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-27. Several other ships were employed in ferrying supplies and ammunition to the base at Kilbotn, including the Norwegian cargo ship Senja. The attack destroyed Black Watch and Senja and also , which had been moored alongside Black Watch. Two British aircraft with four aircrew were lost, and an estimated 150 German personnel were either wounded or killed.  The attack  The attack was carried out by the First Cruiser Squadron under the command of Vice Admiral Rhoderick McGrigor, second-in-command of the Home Fleet, in his flagship . The force included the cruiser , three escort carriers, and eight destroyers and other vessels. The carriers embarked three Naval Air Squadrons and 846 Squadron in contributed eight Avenger torpedo-bombers and four Wildcat fighters, 853 Squadron in contributed eight Avengers and four Wildcats and 882 Squadron in contributed twenty Wildcats. The force sailed from Scapa Flow on 1 May.CinCHF War Diary 1945. Naval-history.net. Retrieved on 2011-05-27. The force was aware of the strength of the defences at Kilbotn and of the presence of a German fighter base at Bardufoss, to the east. Four Wildcats were assigned to provide top-cover against German fighters, while the majority of the other Wildcats were to arrive at Kilbotn at the start of the operation, to attack the gun emplacements on land and in the harbour. Eight of the Wildcats were armed with a bomb to attack the flak-ship Thetis (formerly ).

The German early-warning systems in the islands ‚Äì radar, gun emplacements and spotters ‚Äì could not have failed to observe and identify the aircraft passing over but by great good luck for the attackers, the headquarters staff at Harstad failed to circulate a warning. The airborne force, under the command of Lt. Cdr. C.L.F. Webb RN, arriving from the west over Kilbotn at 17:00 on a sunny afternoon, achieved almost complete surprise. In the initial attack, a Wildcat of 882 Squadron was hit and crashed into the water with the loss of the pilot. Several aircraft received flak damage in the next few minutes but the attack went according to plan. An Avenger of 846 Squadron made a forced landing with the loss of the crew.Harald Isachsen (2009), Operation Judgement: Angrepet p√• <>, Kilbotn 4 Mai 1945, In Kilbotn village, from the main target Black Watch, one bomb fell near some houses after a fault in the launching mechanism of one of the Avengers. With its time-delayed fuse, it exploded after entering soft ground, which absorbed most of the splinters. Two houses suffered windows blown out and some damaged woodwork. The remaining 42 aircraft returned to the carriers. Onboard U-711 the harbour crew of eight, including the captain, Hans-G√ºnther Lange, survived by moving the boat away from the vessels under attack. It was damaged and sank some hours later but the eight men were picked up. Lange was interviewed in 2008 at the age of 92 for a book published in Norway which also contains information from Norwegian and British eyewitnesses.Harald Isachsen (2009), Operation Judgement: Angrepet p√• <>, Kilbotn 4 Mai 1945, A summary of the Operation is also given on a Norwegian website for divers, and background information is given in the Commander-in-Chief Home Fleet's War Diary for 1945.Black Watch 3.

Aftermath  The First Cruiser Squadron sailed south to provide air-cover for Operation Cleaver, the passage of ships in the Skagerrak and arrived back at Scapa Flow on 10 May. The attack on Kilbotn was one of the last actions in the Allied campaign against the U-boat menace. Captain Lange reported in 2008 that Germany's leader D√∂nitz had ordered the immediate cessation of all U-boat attacks on Allied shipping as part of the surrender of naval forces on 4/5 May. Lange stated that this signal had been received on board U-711 in the early afternoon and therefore his crew believed their war was over before the Fleet Air Arm attack arrived. Despite this, U-boat operations and allied counter- measures continued until the final German surrender on 8 May. The last U-boat destroyed, and the last Allied ships sunk, were in the actions of 7/8 May 1945. Of the four British aircrew lost in Operation Judgement, Lt. Hugh Morrison from Wairarapa, New Zealand, Senior Pilot of 882 Squadron, is buried in Narvik New Cemetery.Narvik Cemetery. Militaryphotos.net. Retrieved on 2011-05-27.

History  Thomas Stokes was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on November 1, 1898, to Thomas Lunsford Stokes and Emma Layton, both descendants of colonial families. His father was a co-founder of Davison-Paxon-Stokes, a major department store chain in the southeastern United States. He graduated from the University of Georgia in 1920, after 3 years. He began his journalism career working as a reporter for Georgia newspapers and then moved to Washington in 1921, where he took dictation from reporters at United Press. He later worked as a copy editor and then as a reporter covering all aspects of Washington politics. He greeted the New Deal with enthusiasm and his coverage of the early days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration brought him to the attention of the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain, which hired him as its Washington correspondent in 1933. In 1937, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America reprinted a series of his articles under the title Carpetbaggers of Industry to indict businesses that relocated to the South in search of lower-earning workers.James Charles Cobb, The selling of the South: the Southern crusade for industrial development, 1936-1990 (University of Illinois, 1993), 7; Patricia Sullivan, Days of Hope: Race and Democracy in the New Deal Era (University of North Carolina Press, 1996), His coverage of FDR's administration grew more critical over time. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1939 for investigating how Kentucky politicians had corrupted the Works Progress Administration (WPA) to advance their own careers. He concluded the Kentucky WPA was \\"a grand political racket in which the taxpayer is the victim.\\"New York Times: \\"Lincoln Play Wins a Pulitzer Award,\\" May 2, 1939, accessed December 12, 2010 Stokes and WPA Administrator Harry Hopkins traded charges for several days.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 11 January 2019 Gandolfi educated under the Jesuits of the English province, partly at Li√®ge academy and partly at Stonyhurst College, where on 4 October. 1801 he was appointed to teach Humanities. He left Stonyhurst in 1804, and after receiving holy orders was appointed to the mission at Newport, Isle of Wight. Subsequently, he was attached to the Spanish Chapel, Manchester Square, London, where he obtained great celebrity as a preacher. By the publication of his Liturgy and his sermons \\"in defence of the ancient faith\\" he incurred the displeasure of his ecclesiastical superior, Bishop Poynter, who suspended him and denounced his works. Gandolphy proceeded to Rome in order to appeal against the bishop's decision. There he obtained in 1816 official approbations of the two censured works from Stephen Peter Damiani, master of sacred theology and apostolic penitentiary at St. Peter's, and from Francis Joseph O'Finan, prior of the Dominican convent of St. Sixtus and St. Clement. The Sacred Congregation of Propaganda, wishing to terminate the controversy, by letters dated 1 March 1817, required that Gandolphy should be restored to the possession of his former missionary faculties on apologising to Bishop Poynter for whatever might have been disrespectfully stated by him in an address to the public hastily printed some months previously, and of which the bishop had complained to the holy see. Gandolphy accordingly drew up and subscribed an apology on 15 April.The Orthodox journal and Catholic monthly intelligencer, (W.E. Andrews, ed.), 1817, p. 172 In a pastoral letter dated 24 April the bishop declared the apology to be insufficient. On 8 July Gandolphy made a full and unconditional apology in obedience to the bishop's demands. He never recovered from this humiliation. In 1818 he resigned his chaplaincy at Spanish Place, and retiring to the residence of his relatives at East Sheen, died there on 9 July 1821. Dr. Oliver says that Gandolphy 'wrote too rapidly not to err against theological precision,‚Äô but Bishop Milner remarks that there was 'no heterodox or dangerous principle in his mind.'

The hotel was built on a huge scale, with a perimeter measurement of one mile. Situated on a hill to the west of the falls, it dominated the landscape. It had an elegant resort-like air when first built. After World War II it was regarded by the National Park Service as outdated. Suffering from neglect, it was abandoned in the late 1950s and was in the process of demolition when it was destroyed by fire in 1960. Temporary hotel The Canyon Hotel was one of four major hotels operated by the Yellowstone Park Company in the early and mid twentieth century in Yellowstone. The company operated a circuit tour of Yellowstone, featuring stops at the Mammoth Hotel, the Old Faithful Inn, the Lake Hotel and the Canyon Hotel, taking about five days for the complete tour.Barringer, pp. 42-48 There were three successive hotels at the Canyon site. The first hotel was built by the Yellowstone Park Association, a predecessor to the Yellowstone Park Company, opening in May 1886. The prefabricated structure was intended to be a temporary replacement for a tent camping accommodation. This hotel was placed close to the Upper Falls. By agreement with the Department of the Interior, the building was to serve a single season and was to be demolished in August 1886, when construction was to start on a permanent hotel. A sawmill was built and timber was cut and sawn, but no work on the hotel took place until 1889.Quinn, pp. 73-74 Second Canyon Hotel Architect Robert Reamer (left) and the construction foreman, Mr. George, at the Canyon Hotel during construction in October 1910. The second hotel, incorporated into the new hotel, is visible at left The new hotel was built about south of the present Canyon Junction. The site was an east-facing meadow on a prominent hillside overlooking the road. The building, when completed in 1891, was called by the park superintendent \\"a most unsightly edifice.\\" The hotel compensated for its unattractive appearance by offering a high standard of comfort and service. This second hotel was a plain three-story wood-framed building with an entrance porch on the long dimension of the building. The 250-room hotel was enlarged with twenty-four more rooms in 1901, when dormers were added to the roof. Foundation troubles, discovered during the original construction, required that rooms in the original section be replastered during the 1901 work.Haines, p. 129 Third Canyon Hotel Aerial view of the Canyon Hotel in 1958 The third hotel was designed by architect Robert Reamer, a close friend of Yellowstone Park Company president Harry W. Child, who had designed the Old Faithful Inn and a renovation of the Lake Hotel in 1903. Reamer and the Childs had together taken a grand tour of Europe in 1909, and at Child's direction Reamer set out to design an elegant accommodation, in contrast to the rustic Old Faithful Inn. Reamer, assisted by Charles A. Popkin, incorporated the old hotel into the new design, but changed its character completely to a long, horizontal structure that flowed along the hillside, anchored by a heavy hipped roof accented by prominent hipped dormers. The new hotel comprised 400 rooms with 100 baths, and measured in length making it the largest building ever built in Yellowstone.Quinn, p. 75 Construction started in June 1910, and the hotel was already enclosed by October. Nearly all exterior work was completed by December, and work continued on the interior through the winter. The partially complete hotel opened for guests in June 1911, with the grand opening held on August 2, 1911.Quinn, pp. 76-77 The hotel showed clear influences of Frank Lloyd Wright's Prairie School with its horizontal lines and dominating roof. The interior made generous use of sturdy pilasters and exposed timber roof framing, with interior spaces following the slope of the hill down to the massive porte-cochere entrance. The lounge, located to one side of the sloped entrance structure, measured by , featured views through panoramic windows from an elegant, sheltered space, and was overlooked by viewing platforms and bandstands within.Quinn, pp. 78-79 In 1936 the Old Faithful Inn and Canyon Hotel advertised rates of $2.75 per day without meals in a single person room, ranging upwards to $9 per day for a single room with attached bath and meals. The basement featured a notable wine cellar, bowling alleys and billiard rooms, as well as meeting and banquet rooms. Mission 66 Following World War II, National Park Service facilities were in a state of poor repair and were incapable of accommodating the floods of automobile-borne tourists that patronized the national parks in the 1950s. The Mission 66 program was proposed as a Service-wide program to improve or replace visitor accommodations, transportation systems, interpretive facilities and park infrastructure in time for the 50th anniversary of the National Park Service in 1966. One feature of the program was the de-emphasis of park hotels, which were built with railroad-borne tourists in mind, in favor of motel-style accommodations that catered specifically to visitors arriving in automobiles.Barringer, pp. 129-130 The Yellowstone master plan stated that > New hotels shall not be proposed. Present hotels should be placed into > disuse and ultimately removed as they deteriorate and become marginal in > income.\\" As the chief park concessioner, the Yellowstone Park Company was required to participate in the construction of new facilities to these new standards. The chief new development in Yellowstone was to be Canyon Village, one of the biggest such projects of Mission 66. The all-new community to the east of the hotel included a visitor center, shopping, service station and amphitheater. Visitor accommodations were centered on 500 motel-style units in a series of individual buildings of twenty or so rooms, centering on a new common lodge building. The complex included new housing for park employees, and when full, could accommodate almost five thousand visitors and employees.Barringer, p. 131 Ground was broken for Canyon Village on June 25, 1956, with completion late in the summer of 1957. It became immediately apparent that visitors preferred the Canyon Hotel to the new facilities. The Yellowstone Park Company, in financial difficulty as a result of its contributions to the Mission 66 projects, partially closed the hotel to encourage visitors to stay at Canyon Village,Culpin, p. 146 closing it entirely for the 1959 season.Barringer, p. 141 Decline and destruction Demolition of the Canyon Hotel 1960 Canyon Hotel on fire, August 8/9, 1960, 2:00 AM In 1957 Lemuel Garrison, who had been chairman of the Mission 66 steering committee, became superintendent of Yellowstone.Culpin, pp. 107-108 In 1958 Garrison noted that a portion of the hotel was beyond repair, with uncorrected foundation issues dating to the 1891 building. Garrison speculated that some portion of the hotel could be stabilized, or that the most impressive portions might be moved and incorporated into the Canyon Village development. Garrison ultimately decided to demolish the hotel in 1959,Culpin pp. 108-109 with planning for the demolition starting in June 1959. After some debate about the possibility of moving some portions of the hotel to Lake, the Carlos Construction Company of Cody, Wyoming was awarded the demolition contract for a $25 bid. Carlos was given 900 days to remove the hotel.Culpin, p. 109 On August 17, 1959 the 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake hit Yellowstone, damaging facilities throughout the park. While the quake has been cited as a rationale for the hotel's demolition, it is clear that the decision to demolish had already been made and implemented. The hotel burned to the ground the night of August 8, 1960. No cause has ever been assigned to the fire.Culpin, p. 111 References Sources *Barringer, Mark Daniel.

The main function of a separator is to keep the two electrodes apart to prevent electrical short circuits while also allowing the transport of ionic charge carriers that are needed to close the circuit during the passage of current in an electrochemical cell. Separators are critical components in liquid electrolyte batteries. A separator generally consists of a polymeric membrane forming a microporous layer. It must be chemically and electrochemically stable with regard to the electrolyte and electrode materials and mechanically strong enough to withstand the high tension during battery construction. They are important to batteries because their structure and properties considerably affect the battery performance, including the batteries energy and power densities, cycle life, and safety. History Unlike many forms of technology, polymer separators were not developed specifically for batteries. They were instead spin-offs of existing technologies, which is why most are not optimized for the systems they are used in. Even though this may seem unfavorable, most polymer separators can be mass-produced at a low cost, because they are based on existing forms of technologies. Yoshino and co- workers at Asahi Kasei first developed them for a prototype of secondary lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in 1983. Schematic of a lithium ion battery Initially, lithium cobalt oxide was used as the cathode and polyacetylene as the anode. Later in 1985, it was found that using lithium cobalt oxide as the cathode and graphite as the anode produced an excellent secondary battery with enhanced stability, employing the frontier electron theory of Kenichi Fukui. This enabled the development of portable devices, such as cell phones and laptops. However, before lithium ion batteries could be mass-produced, safety concerns needed to be addressed such as overheating and over potential. One key to ensuring safety was the separator between the cathode and anode. Yoshino developed a microporous polyethylene membrane separator with a ‚Äúfuse‚Äù function. In the case of abnormal heat generation within the battery cell, the separator provides a shutdown mechanism. The micropores close by melting and the ionic flow terminates. In 2004, a novel electroactive polymer separator with the function of overcharge protection was first proposed by Denton and coauthors. This kind of separator reversibly switches between insulating and conducting states. Changes in charge potential drive the switch. More recently, separators primarily provide charge transport and electrode separation.  Materials  Materials include nonwoven fibers (cotton, nylon, polyesters, glass), polymer films (polyethylene, polypropylene, poly (tetrafluoroethylene), polyvinyl chloride), ceramic and naturally occurring substances (rubber, asbestos, wood). Some separators employ polymeric materials with pores of less than 20 √Ö, generally too small for batteries. Both dry and wet processes are used for fabrication. Nonwovens consist of a manufactured sheet, web or mat of directionally or randomly oriented fibers. Supported liquid membranes consist of a solid and liquid phase contained within a microporous separator. Some polymer electrolytes form complexes with alkali metal salts, which produce ionic conductors that serve as solid electrolytes. Solid ion conductors, can serve as both separator and the electrolyte. Separators can use a single or multiple layers/sheets of material.  Production  Polymer separators generally are made from microporous polymer membranes. Such membranes are typically fabricated from a variety of inorganic, organic and naturally occurring materials. Pore sizes are typically larger than 50-100 √Ö. Membranes synthesized by dry processes are more suitable for higher power density, given their open and uniform pore structure, while those made by wet processes are offer more charge/discharge cycles because of their tortuous and interconnected pore structure. This helps to suppress the conversion of charge carriers into crystals on anodes during fast or low temperature charging.  Dry process  The dry process involves extruding, annealing and stretching steps. The final porosity depends on the morphology of the precursor film and the specifics of each step. The extruding step is generally carried out at a temperature higher than the melting point of the polymer resin. This is because the resins are melted to shape them into a uniaxially-oriented tubular film, called a precursor film. The structure and orientation of the precursor film depends on the processing conditions and the resin's characteristics. In the annealing process, the precursor is annealed at a temperature slightly lower than the polymer's melting point. The purpose of this step is to improve the crystalline structure. During stretching, the annealed film is deformed along the machine direction by a cold stretch followed by a hot stretch followed by relaxation. The cold stretch creates the pore structure by stretching the film at a lower temperature with a faster strain rate. The hot stretch increases pore sizes using a higher temperature and a slower strain rate. The relaxation step reduces internal stress within the film. The dry process is only suitable for polymers with high crystallinity. These include but are not limited to: semi-crystalline polyolefins, polyoxymethylene, and isotactic poly (4-methyl-1-pentene). One can also use blends of immiscible polymers, in which at least one polymer has a crystalline structure, such as polyethylene-polypropylene, polystyrene- polypropylene, and poly (ethylene terephthalate) - polypropylene blends.  Wet process  The wet process consists of mixing, heating, extruding and additive removal steps. The polymer resins are first mixed with, paraffin oil, antioxidant and other additives. The mixture is heated to produce a homogenous solution. The heated solution is pushed through a sheet die to make a gel-like film. The additives are then removed with a volatile solvent to form the microporous result. The wet process is suitable for both crystalline and amorphous polymers. Wet process separators often use ultrahigh-molecular- weight polyethylene. The use of these polymers enables the batteries with favorable mechanical properties, while shutting it down when it becomes too hot.  Choice of polymer  The chemical structure of polypropylene The chemical structure of polyethylene Specific types of polymers are ideal for the different types of synthesis. Most polymers currently used in battery separators are polyolefin based materials with semi-crystalline structure. Among them, polyethylene, polypropylene, and their blends such as polyethylene-polypropylene are widely used. Recently, graft polymers have been studied in an attempt to improve battery performance, including micro-porous poly(methyl methacrylate)-grafted and siloxane grafted polyethylene separators, which show favorable surface morphology and electrochemical properties compared to conventional polyethylene separators. In addition, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofiber webs can be synthesized as a separator to improve both ion conductivity and dimensional stability. Another type of polymer separator, polytriphenylamine (PTPAn)-modified separator, is an electroactive separator with reversible overcharge protection.  Placement  Side view of a battery Always the separator is placed between the anode and the cathode. The pores of the separator are filled with the electrolyte and packaged for use.  Essential properties  ; Chemical stability: The separator material must be chemically stable against the electrolyte and electrode materials under the strongly reactive environments when the battery is fully charged. The separator should not degrade. Stability is assessed by use testing. ; Thickness: A battery separator must be thin to facilitate the battery's energy and power densities. A separator that is too thin can compromise mechanical strength and safety. Thickness should be uniform to support many charging cycles. 25.4Œºm-(1.0 mil) is generally the standard width. The thickness of a polymer separator can be measured using the T411 om-83 method developed under the auspices of the Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry. ; Porosity: The separator must have sufficient pore density to hold liquid electrolyte that enables ions to move between the electrodes. Excessive porosity hinders the ability of the pores to close, which is vital to allow the separator to shut down an overheated battery. Porosity can be measured using liquid or gas absorption methods according to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D-2873. Typically, a Li- ion battery separator provides porosity of 40%. ; Pore size: Pore size must be smaller than the particle size of the electrode components, including the active materials and conducting additives. Ideally the pores should be uniformly distributed while also having a tortuous structure. This ensures a uniform current distribution throughout the separator while suppressing the growth of Li on the anode. The distribution and structure of pores can be analyzed using a Capillary Flow Porometer or a Scanning Electron Microscope. ; Permeability: The separator must not limit performance. Polymer separators typically increase the resistance of the electrolyte by a factor of four to five. The ratio of the resistance of the electrolyte-filled separator to the resistance of the electrolyte alone is called the MacMullin number. Air permeability can be used indirectly to estimate the MacMullin number. Air permeability is expressed in terms of the Gurley value, the time required for a specified amount of air to pass through a specified area of the separator under a specified pressure. The Gurley value reflects the tortuosity of the pores, when the porosity and thickness of the separator is fixed. A separator with uniform porosity is vital to battery life cycle. Deviations from uniform permeability produce uneven current density distribution, which causes the formation of crystals on the anode. ; Mechanical strength: The separator must be strong enough to withstand the tension of the winding operation during battery assembly. Mechanical strength is typically defined in terms of the tensile strength in both the machine (winding) direction and the transverse direction, in terms of tear resistance and puncture strength. These parameters are defined in terms of Young‚Äôs modulus. ; Wettability: The electrolyte must fill the entire battery assembly, requiring the separator to \\"wet\\" easily with the electrolyte. Furthermore, the electrolyte should be able to permanently wet the separator, preserving the cycle life. There is no generally accepted method used to test wettability, other than observation. ; Thermal stability: The separator must remain stable over a wide temperature range without curling or puckering, laying completely flat. ; Thermal shutdown: Separators in lithium-ion batteries must offer the ability to shut down at a temperature slightly lower than that at which thermal runaway occurs, while retaining its mechanical properties. Defects Many structural defects can form in polymer separators due to temperature changes. These structural defects can result in a thicker separators. Furthermore, there can be intrinsic defects in the polymers themselves, such as polyethylene often begins to deteriorate during the stages of polymerization, transportation, and storage. Additionally, defects such as tears or holes can form during the synthesis of polymer separators. There are also other sources of defects can come from doping the polymer separator. Use in Li-ion Batteries Polymer separators, similar to battery separators in general, act as a separator of the anode and cathode in the Li-ion battery while also enabling the movement of ions through the cell. Additionally, many of the polymer separators, typically multilayer polymer separators, can act as ‚Äúshutdown separators‚Äù, which are able to shut down the battery if it becomes too hot during the cycling process. These multilayered polymer separators are generally composed of one or more polyethylene layers which serve to shut down the battery and at least one polypropylene layer which acts as a form of mechanical support for the separator. Other types of battery separators In addition to polymer separators, there are several other types of separators. There are nonwovens, which consist of a manufactured sheet, web, or mat of directionally or randomly oriented fibers. Supported liquid membranes, which consist of a solid and liquid phase contained within a microporous separator. Additionally there are also polymer electrolytes which can form complexes with different types of alkali metal salts, which results in the production of ionic conductors which serve as solid electrolytes. Another type of separator, a solid ion conductor, can serve as both a separator and the electrolyte in a battery. Plasma technology was used to modify a polyethylene membrane for enhanced adhesion, wettability and printability. These are usually performed by modifying the membrane on only its outermost several molecular levels. This allows the surface to behave differently without modifying the properties of the remainder. The surface was modified with acrylonitrile via a plasma coating technique. The resulting acrylonitrile-coated membrane was named PiAn-PE. The surface characterization demonstrated that PiAN-PE's enhanced adhesion resulted from the increased polar component of surface energy. The sealed rechargeable nickel-metal hydride battery offers significant performance and environmental friendliness above alkaline rechargeable batteries. Ni/MH, like the lithium-ion battery, provides high energy and power density with long cycle lives. This technology's greatest problem is its inherent high corrosion rate in aqueous solutions. The most commonly used separators are porous insulator films of polyolefin, nylon or cellophane. Acrylic compounds can be radiation-grafted onto these separators to make their properties more wettable and permeable. Zhijiang Cai and co-workers developed a solid polymer membrane gel separator. This was a polymerization product of one or more monomers selected from the group of water-soluble ethylenically unsaturated amides and acid. The polymer- based gel also includes a water swellable polymer, which acts as a reinforcing element. Ionic species are added to the solution and remain embedded in the gel after polymerization. Ni/MH batteries of bipolar design (bipolar batteries) are being developed because they offer some advantages for applications as storage systems for electric vehicles. This solid polymer membrane gel separator could be useful for such applications in bipolar design. In other words, this design can help to avoid short-circuits occurring in liquid-electrolyte systems. Inorganic polymer separators have also been of interest as use in lithium-ion batteries. Inorganic particulate film/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)/inorganic particulate film trilayer separators are prepared by dip-coating inorganic particle layers on both sides of PMMA thin films. This inorganic trilayer membrane is believed to be an inexpensive, novel separator for application in lithium-ion batteries from increased dimensional and thermal stability.

His early career is obscure, but it must have been distinguished enough for him to rise to the chief priesthood of Alexander and the Theoi Adelphoi in 271/270 BC. After the outbreak of the Chremonidean War, he led a diplomatic and military expedition to the Aegean Sea that expanded Ptolemaic control by establishing bases at Crete, Ceos, Thera, Attica and the Argolid. From these bases he tried, without much success, to aid the Athenians against Antigonus II Gonatas, King of Macedon. He may have been the defeated Ptolemaic commander at the Battle of Cos, which marked the end of Ptolemaic thalassocracy. Early life and career Octadrachm showing Ptolemy II Philadelphus (front), and his sister/wife Arsinoe II Patroclus' early life is obscure; nothing is known of his family apart from the name of his father, Patron. He certainly held various offices in the service of Ptolemy II, in which he must have distinguished himself for his ability and loyalty, particularly to Ptolemy's sister and second wife, Arsinoe II, before being appointed to the prestigious post of eponymous priest of the deified Alexander the Great and the Sibling Gods (Theoi Adelphoi, the deified Ptolemy II and Arsinoe) in 271/270 BC. His appointment to that office has been seen by some scholars as either a reward, or an incentive, for his execution of the poet Sotades, who in his compositions denounced the incestuous marriage between Ptolemy II and Arsinoe. Sotades was imprisoned in Alexandria, but managed to escape to the \\"island of Kaunos\\", until Patroclus captured him and ordered him to be stuck in a leaden box and dropped him into the sea. Chremonidean War The Chremonidean War, which broke out in late 268 BC, provides the stage for the better known part of Patroclus' career. Patroclus has frequently been called nauarchos (admiral) by modern studies, beginning with the British classicist William Woodthorpe Tarn, who in the early 20th century conceived the Ptolemaic nauarchos as having been an office of almost viceregal authority, held by men like Philocles, the king of Sidon, for terms of ten years each. As the French historian Marcel Launey has shown, the title is applied to Patroclus only once in ancient sources, by the 2nd-century BC geographer Pausanias; all contemporary or later literary and epigraphical sources refer to him as strategos (general), which must have been his actual title. Indeed, according to the German classicist Hans Hauben, his Macedonian origin seems to argue for a previous career in the army rather than in the navy. The actual extent of Patroclus' authority is a matter of dispute in current scholarship, but it is clear that he enjoyed broad powers over the other Ptolemaic commanders and their allies in the Aegean Sea. In early 267 BC, he headed a large Ptolemaic embassy to Crete, with the aim of securing his master's influence there, as well as bases for operations in the Aegean Sea. Patroclus is attested by name in two cities, Itanus and Olus. He was honoured with the proxenia and the title of benefactor by both cities, as well as with the citizenship of Itanus‚Äîa rare honour. In Olus, his fellow envoys are also attested: Callicrates of Samos, his predecessor as eponymous priest, and seven others. According to Launey's interpretation, it was at that point that Patroclus went to \\"the island of Kaudos\\", as he emends Kaunos, where he executed Sotades. Launey's emendation has long been accepted by most scholars, but the problems of chronology and geography render \\"a definitive solution impossible\\", according to Hauben. The \\"Island of Patroclus\\", seen from Sounion Epigraphical evidence suggests that Patroclus then visited Ceos. He made Ioulis, one of the four cities of the island, his headquarters, and apparently refounded the city of Koressos, naming it after Queen Arsinoe. A garrison was installed on the island, under the epistates Hieron of Syracuse. While there, Patroclus received a request from the citizens of Thera who were troubled by internal strife. He selected a board of five judges from Ioulis, to put the affairs of Thera in order. Patroclus also appointed an epistates, Apollodorus, probably also from Ioulis, but his exact role, i.e., whether his role was temporary, linked with the mission of the judges, or as commander of a permanent garrison on the island, is unclear. At about the same time, Patroclus expanded his ring of naval bases around the Greek mainland, occupying Methana in the Argolid, which he also renamed Arsinoe. As the Athenian port of Piraeus was probably still in the hands of an Antigonid Macedonian garrison, he also fortified an uninhabited island off the coast of Attica, named after him \\"Isle of Patroclus\\". At about this time, Patroclus dedicated a phiale to the panhellenic sanctuary at Delos. These moves served to tighten Ptolemaic control over the Aegean, but his active intervention in the war was unsuccessful. In 266 BC, Patroclus with his troops tried to aid the Athenians. The literary references to the subsequent events are limited to brief statements by Pausanias, which indicate that the Ptolemaic troops proved ineffective. Patroclus requested the assistance of the Spartan king Areus I, excusing his inability to take the offensive alone with the comment that his men were native Egyptians and sailors. As Hans Hauben comments, this comment may reveal more about \\"a certain Greek (and Macedonian) milieu\\" and its \\"visceral contempt for native Egyptians\\", rather than have any basis in facts. Nevertheless, archaeological evidence on the island of Patroklos and other fortified sites in Attica suggest that Patroclus' involvement was more extensive than implied by Pausanias: coins, pottery shards, and remnants of fortifications point to a Ptolemaic presence not only on the southeastern shores of Attica, such as the peninsula of Koroni or a coastal fort in the deme of Atene, but further inland as well, in Ilioupoli and Mount Hymettus, and on the southwestern shores, at Vouliagmeni. This presence implies an attempt to neutralize the fortress of Sounion on the extreme south of Attica, which was probably also under Antigonid control, as well as an effort to supply Athens overland, bypassing the Antigonid-controlled Piraeus. In the event, although the Spartan army may have come as close as Kamatero, they could not advance further, and withdrew. Patroclus' envisaged two-pronged attack on the Antigonid army did not materialize. Epigraphical evidence from the coastal Athenian outpost of Rhamnous, which was being harassed by the Antigonid army and pirates collaborating with them, or simply taking advantage of the general chaos, also attests to the fact that Athenian and Ptolemaic attempts to safeguard Attica were not wholly effective. In 265/4 BC, Areus once again tried to cross the Isthmus of Corinth and aid the beleaguered Athenians, but the Macedonian king Antigonus II Gonatas concentrated his forces against him and defeated the Spartans, with Areus himself among the dead. Despite the presence of Patroclus and his fleet, it appears that Ptolemy II hesitated to fully commit himself to the conflict. The reasons for this reluctance are unclear, but it appears that, especially in the last years of the war, Ptolemaic involvement was limited to financial support for the Greek city-states and naval assistance. The end of Ptolemaic involvement may be related to the Battle of Cos, whose chronology is much disputed by modern scholars. Almost nothing is known about the events of the battle, except that Antigonus II Gonatas, although outnumbered, led his fleet to defeat Ptolemy's unnamed commanders. A surviving anecdote where Patroclus taunted the Macedonian king for his lack of mastery over the sea has been interpreted by some scholars, such as Hans Hauben, as indicating that Cos belongs to the Chremonidean War and was fought around 262/1 BC, with Patroclus in command of the Ptolemaic fleet. Others, however, place the battle around 255 BC, at the time of the Second Syrian War. Whatever the actual events, it is clear that Cos marked the end of absolute Ptolemaic thalassocracy in the Aegean.

Following the unsuccessful counter-revolutionary Junker mutiny of 29 October 1917 he was imprisoned in the Fortress of Peter and Paul in Petrograd. On 18 December 1917, after his release was negotiated by the Polish Military Committee in Petrograd, Stanis≈Çaw Szostak joined the Junkers company of the 1st Knights Legion of the 1st Polish Corps. Later, he served with the Officer Cadet Legion within the 1st Corps until 6 June 1918. At the beginning of his tour of service, in January 1918 he took part in the capture of the Bobrujsk fortress occupied by the Bolshevik forces. After the dissolution of the 1st Corps was admitted to study at the Politechnika Warzawska. He, nonetheless, chose to interrupt the studies on 18 December 1918, volunteering to serve with the Bialystok Rifle Regiment of the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division commanded by General Jan Rzadkowski ‚Äì first as a private he commanding a section, subsequently as a corporal in charge of a platoon. During the Polish-Soviet war of 1919‚Äì21 he fought on the Lithuanian-Belarusian Front in the regimental technical support company and remained with the regiment until 20 May 1920. From 25 May to 18 August 1920 he was an officer cadet at Infantry Officers School in Warsaw. After completing the course he was assigned to serve with the reserve battalion of the 56 Wielkopolski Infantry Regiment as a platoon commander. On 15 December 1920 Stanislaw Szostak was promoted to the rank of a second lieutenant. On 3 May 1922 he was verified as a lieutenant with seniority from 1 June 1919 in the corps of Infantry Officers. In June of that year he was appointed to be the adjutant of the Second Battalion of 56th Wielkopolski Infantry Regiment. Early in 1924 Lt Szostak joined the Central Tank School of the 1st Tank Regiment, which was equipped with French Renault FT tanks, and from August 1925 he commanded a platoon of the 7th Tank Company. From 1928 to 1931 he commanded 6th, 7th, and then 4th company of tanks. On 19 March 1928 he was promoted to the rank of a captain (seniority from 1 January 1928). From June 1931 to April 1938 he took up training responsibilities. First, from June 1931 to April 1934 he lectured at the Training Centre of Tanks and Armoured Cars in Warsaw. Then, in the years 1935 to 1938 he was the head of the Training Department at the headquarters of the Armoured Corps attached to the Ministry of Military Affairs in Warsaw. On 19 March 1937 he was promoted to the rank of major of the Armour Corps. From April 1938 Major Szostak was a deputy commander of the 7th Armoured Battalion in Grodno. Shortly before the invasion of Poland by Germany, in August 1939 Major Szostak became the commander of the mobilised 32nd Reconnaissance Armoured Unit consisting of 3 squadrons with 13 TKS tankettesPolish Armour 1939 - TKS tankette Series I TKS tankettes and 8 type 34-II armoured cars.Wz34 - II- Polish Armoured Car - I Type 34 - II armoured cars World War II in Poland After the outbreak of World War II in Europe, Major Szostak and the 32nd Reconnaissance Armoured Unit under his command took part in the battles of Grajewo and Szczuczyn.

Greek terracotta figurine, late 4th century BC, National Museum of Magna Grecia. Bronze statuette, Roman imperial, 1st-3rd century AD, British Museum. Aphroditus or Aphroditos (, , ) was a male Aphrodite originating from Amathus on the island of Cyprus and celebrated in Athens. Aphroditus was portrayed as having a female shape and clothing like Aphrodite's but also a phallus, and hence, a male name. This deity would have arrived in Athens from Cyprus in the 4th century BC. In the 5th century BC, however, there existed hermae of Aphroditus, or phallic statues with a female head. Aphroditus is the same as the later god Hermaphroditos, whose name is a combinations of his parents Aphrodite and Hermes, who first occurs in the Characters of Theophrastus. Photius also explained that Aphroditus was Hermaphroditos, and cited fragments from Attic comedies mentioning the divinity.Braund, David (2005), Scythians and Greeks: cultural interactions in Scythia, Athens and the early Roman empire (sixth century BC - first century AD), University of Exeter Press; p. 78 In later mythology Hermaphroditos came to be regarded as the son of Hermes and Aphrodite.Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim; James Freake (1993), Three books of occult philosophy, Llewellyn Worldwide; p. 495 One of the earliest surviving images from Athens is a fragment (late 4th century BC), found in the Athenian agora, of a clay mould for a terracotta figurine. The figurine would have stood about 30 cm high, represented in a style known as (anasyromenos), a female lifting her dress to reveal male genitals,Theophrastus; James Diggle (2004), Characters, Cambridge University Press; pp. 367-68 a gesture that was believed to have apotropaic qualities, averting evil influences and bestowing good luck.Koloski-Ostrow, Ann Olga; Lyons, Claire L. (2000), Naked truths: women, sexuality, and gender in classical art and archaeology, Routledge; pp. 230-231 This combination of the male and female in one divinity and being associated with the moon, both of which were considered to have fertilizing powers, was regarded as having an influence over the entire animal and vegetable creation. Etymology Origins Worship According to Macrobius, who mentions the goddess in his Saturnalia, Philochorus, in his Atthis (referred to by Macrobius), identifies this male-female god with the Moon and says that at its sacrifices men and women exchanged clothing. Philostratus, in describing the rituals involved in the festivals, said that the image or the impersonator of the god was accompanied by a large train of followers in which girls mingled with men because the festivals allowed \\"women to act the part of men, and men put on woman's clothing and play the woman\\".

He was a member of a Limerick family which became politically prominent through their personal influence with the Prince Regent. He was the first of the McMahon Baronets of Dublin.  Background  He was born in Limerick, son of John MacMahon, comptroller of the port of Limerick, and his second wife, Mary Stackpoole, daughter of James Stackpoole, a merchant; his father's relatively low social standing was something of a handicap to him in his career. Born a Roman Catholic, he converted to the Church of Ireland for career purposes. He was educated at the University of Dublin, and called to the Bar in 1799, practicing on the Munster circuit. He was made Third Serjeant-at-law in 1806 , Second Serjeant in 1813 and King's Counsel in 1807. Despite what was called his \\"spluttering\\" manner, and a tendency to verbal gaffes, he built up a very large practice, second only to that of Daniel O'Connell,Geoghegan, Patrick M. King Dan- the rise of Daniel O'Connell Gill and Macmillan Dublin 2008 pp.72-3 whom he remembered with gratitude for having befriended him, at a time when most other barristers looked down on him as the son of a minor official.  Family and political connections  William married firstly Frances Burston, daughter of Beresford Burston K.C., who died in 1813; and secondly Charlotte Shaw, daughter of Sir Robert Shaw, 1st Baronet of Bushy Park, Dublin and his first wife Maria Wilkinson. Of his ten children, who included his heir Sir Beresford MacMahon, 2nd Baronet, the most notable was his third son Charles MacMahon (1824‚Äì1891) who had a distinguished career in Australia as a politician, and who was the second Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police from 1854-58. Charles MacMahon was also Speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly between 1871-77. Although William married into two prominent Dublin families, the Burstons and the Shaws of Bushy Park,The most famous member of the Shaw family of Bushy Park was the celebrated playwright George Bernard Shaw his most valued relative was undoubtedly his much older half-brother, Sir John McMahon, 1st Baronet (1754‚Äì1817) who in 1811 was appointed private secretary to the Prince Regent, later King George IV, and who in the remaining six years of his life was considered to have great influence over the Prince. Certainly he was able to obtain favours for his family: William noted cynically that barristers who had previously despised his family's lowly origins now began fawning on him.Geoghegan pp.72-3 When John Philpot Curran retired as Master of the Rolls in Ireland John was able to obtain the office for William, who was only 37; this is said to be one of the few occasions when the British Royal family has directly intervened in a judicial appointment. William, like his brother, became a baronet. From 1811 he lived at Fortfield House, Terenure, County Dublin, which had been built in 1805 by Barry Yelverton, 1st Viscount Avonmore.  Judicial career and reputation  In previous centuries the office of Master of the Rolls in Ireland had been a notorious sinecure for politicians, who were not necessarily lawyers, or even Irish. However the appointment of Sir Michael Smith in 1801 had marked an effort to turn the office into a full-time judicial position which would attract first class lawyers. Given William's youth, and the blatant nepotism involved in his appointment, it might have been expected to cause controversy. In fact, according to Elrington Ball, there was no protest and the appointment worked out far better than had been feared: William had a reputation for integrity, was popular and hospitable, and a fairly good lawyer.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 An obituary notice published soon after his death in January 1837 bears Ball's assessment out: MacMahon was praised for integrity and lack of political prejudice and as an exceptionally painstaking and conscientious judge; while the writer admitted that William was very slow in giving judgment, this was attributed to his desire to ensure that justice was done.Gentleman's Magazine April 1837 In 1827 he clashed publicly with the new Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Sir Anthony Hart, about his right to appoint his own secretary, but the misunderstanding was quickly resolved.

Background In the Autumn of 1948 the Israeli army launched two major offensives, Operation Hiram in the Galilee and Operation Yoav in the South. On 29 October David Ben-Gurion wrote in his diary that there were rumors of 70‚Äì80 people being \\"slaughtered\\" by the army. On 3 November Yigal Allon ordered OC of the 8th Brigade, General Yitzhak Sadeh to investigate reports that the 89th Battalion had killed \\"many tens\\" of prisoners at Al-Dawayima.Morris, Benny. The birth of the Palestinian refugee problem, 1947‚Äì1949. . (1987). pp. 222, 223. On 7 November the Cabinet appointed a three-man committee of inquiry: Labour and Construction Minister Mordechai Bentov (Mapam), Justice Minister Felix Rosenbl√ºth (Progressive Party), Immigration and Health Minister Hayim Moshe Shapira (Hamizzrahi ‚Äì National Religious Party). On 8 November Eliezer Pra'i, a newspaper editor, received a letter describing the same event which he passed onto Aharon Cohen, a senior member of Mapam, one of the junior partners in the Provisional Government. At a cabinet meeting on 14 November the committee, having encountered a lack of cooperation from the army, asked for more powers. This was rejected by the cabinet and Shapira resigned. Ben-Gurion then proposed, under threat of his resignation, a one-man investigation. The cabinet voted that \\"the Prime Minister investigates the charges concerning the army's behavior towards Arabs in Galilee and the South.\\" Ben-Gurion appointed Attorney-General Ya'akov Shimshon Shapira to head the investigation, staffed by three army officers. Shapira's instructions were: \\"You are requested herein ... to investigate if there were attacks by ... the army on Arab inhabitants in the Galilee and the South, not in conformity with the accepted rules of war ... What were the attacks ...? To what degree was th army command, low and high, responsible for these acts, and to what degree was the existing discipline in the army responsible for this and what should be done to rectify matters and to punish the guilty?\\"Morris, p. 233.

It was his first book, published in 1950. It is not a novel in the usual sense in that it lacks traditional plot and character development. Upon its publication, reviewers noted the book for its unusual literary technique and style. Goyen called it a series of ‚Äúarias‚Äù. Some critics have called it not a novel at all but a work to be read as poetry, over and over. The book touches on themes of family (kinship), human sexuality, place, time, and memory. It received critical acclaim upon its publication, not commercial success, but it did lead the way for support of the author‚Äôs further work through fellowships. Background Goyen began to sketch parts of the novel during World War II, when he served on the aircraft carrier USS Casablanca. After the war he and Navy friend Walter Berns moved to Taos, New Mexico, where they lived near benefactor Frieda Lawrence (widow of D.H. Lawrence) to pursue writing. Publications of several short stories followed, and Goyen was awarded the Southwest Review Literary Fellowship in 1949, which supported his continuing work on the book. It is an autobiographical work, but not in the sense that people might usually think of autobiography. Goyen once remarked, ‚ÄúEverything is auto-biography for me.‚Äù Origin of book title In an interview with The Paris Review in 1976 (on the occasion of the publication of the book‚Äôs Twenty- fifth Anniversary Edition), Goyen relates how he happened upon the title. He was serving on an aircraft carrier during World War II at the time: Alternate titles Goyen considered were Cries Down a Well, Six Elegies, and Six American Portraits. Book summary Two epigraphs open the book. The first is from a character in the book, Aunt Malley Ganchion: ‚ÄúWhat kin are we all to each other, anyway?‚Äù The second is the famous quote from French poet Rimbaud: ‚ÄúJE est un autre.‚Äù Literally translated, it means ‚ÄúI is another.‚Äù Goyen scholar Reginald Gibbons noted this ‚Äúhas the effect of alerting the reader in advance to the multiplicity of selves who narrate the book, all of them also in some sense the author-narrator ‚ÄúGoyen.‚Äù‚Äù Davis interprets both thus: The book is narrated by several people, most notably a man returning after a long absence to his abandoned family home in Charity, Texas; other characters in the man‚Äôs family narrate their own sections, as do inanimate objects (a river, the wind, the woods). The text does not adhere to the usual structure of a novel: there is no ‚Äúplot‚Äù to develop, and characters and events are explored deeply as moments of life are recalled. The book is thus composed of linked accounts of people who lived in the town, loosely connected by the first-person narrator. ‚ÄúThe focus of the novel is the leaving and returning of the self-exiled ‚Äúchildren‚Äù of Charity‚Äîthe interrelatedness of people and place.‚Äù Main characters *The main narrator of the book can be read as being both Boy Ganchion (nephew of Follie and Christy Ganchion) and Ben Berryben Ganchion (son of Malley Ganchion, and thus also a nephew of both Follie and Christy Ganchion). Boy and Ben are distinct characters, but in a few passages their identities seem to overlap. *Granny Ganchion is the family matriarch, the mother of daughters Lauralee and Malley and sons Follie and Christy. *Folner ‚ÄòFollie‚Äô Ganchion, a son of Granny Ganchion, runs away from home with a trapeze artist after experiencing a \\"sensual revelation\\". He is openly effeminate. *Christy Ganchion, older brother of Follie by 14 years, was born from a one-night stand with a traveling circus performer. Themes Primary themes of the book include family (kinship), time, memory, sexuality, place and the identity it brings, and the Christ figure. The book is noted for being ‚Äúa meditation on the nature of identity and origins, memory, and time‚Äôs annihilation of life.‚Äù Some later scholars have focused on the book‚Äôs treatment of male homosexuality. Critical response and reception The House of Breath was received with critical success and puzzlement. Critics appreciated Goyen‚Äôs lyric and evocative prose but at the same time did not think it always worked in the author‚Äôs favor. Goyen‚Äôs family and the people in Trinity, Texas were troubled by what appeared to be the book‚Äôs disturbing autobiographical look at a ‚Äúfictional‚Äù family in a ‚Äúfictional‚Äù East Texas town. In her New York Times review, writer Katherine Anne Porter (best known for her novel Ship of Fools) wrote: ‚ÄúThe House of Breath is not a well-made novel, indeed it is not a novel at all but a sustained evocation of the past‚Ä¶.‚Äù But she concludes her review: ‚Äúthe writing as a whole is disciplined on a high plane, and there are long passages of the best writing, the fullest and richest and most expressive, that I have read in a very long time‚Äîcomplex in form, and beautifully organized‚Ä¶‚Äù A review in Harper‚Äôs Magazine noted: Well-known literary critic Northrop Frye wrote at the time that it was ‚Äúa remarkable book.‚Äù Another reviewer called the book ‚Äúabsorbing‚Äù and ‚Äúmoving.‚Äù The publication of the book brought some literary fame to Goyen, both in New York and in Texas. He would later recall that he felt that ‚Äúeveryone he met in the literary world wanted a piece of him, wanted to admire him as the moment‚Äôs fashion, and yet at the same time he felt that others were angry at him for his moment of public recognition.‚Äù He would also recall later that he was ‚Äújust about disinherited‚Äù by his family after the book‚Äôs publication, and ‚Äúfell out of favor with many people‚Äù in his home town. Later critics have addressed the book‚Äôs exploration and presentation of male homosexuality. Literary technique and style Various critics and reviewers have called the style that the book is written in as abstract, psychological, lyrical, poetic, surreal, experimental, mythic, and fantastic. Goyen scholar Reginald Gibbons stated that the work ‚Äúpondered the problem of how to think about the past, about the life of feeling that one had had in the past‚Ä¶‚Äù Of the form his book takes, Goyen stated in an interview: Goyen recalled afterwards that the book was ‚Äúlike a series of related ‚Äò‚Äôarias‚Äô‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äù Gibbons said that, with The House of Breath, ‚ÄúGoyen invented a new form of the novel.‚Äù Publication history Most of the final text was published in magazines before the entire novel was first published in 1950. It was a critical but not commercial success, and soon fell out of print. However, in 1952 the book was translated in Germany by Ernst Robert Curtius (who also translated T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land) and Elizabeth Schnack and in France by Maurice Edgar Coindreau (William Faulkner's translator). Goyen‚Äôs work enjoyed more success in Europe than in America, and the book never went out of print there. In 1975 in the U.S., the book was reprinted as a Twenty-fifth Anniversary Edition, with a brief introductory note from the author, and ‚Äúwith changes that downplayed the novel‚Äôs erotic charge.‚Äù In 2000, TriQuarterly Books (Northwestern University Press) printed the original version, as a Fiftieth Anniversary Edition, with an afterword by Reginald Gibbons, former editor of TriQuarterly magazine and Goyen scholar. Adaptation Goyen adapted the book into a play of the same name, published in 1956. In 1971 he adapted the book into a play titled House of Breath Black/White. Trinity Square Repertory Company (Providence, Rhode Island) staged this adaptation, in which three characters were duplicated by black and white actors. Honors In the year of its first edition, The House of Breath won the MacMurray Award for best first novel by a Texan. The book was also nominated for the first National Book Award for Fiction. An excerpt from the book, ‚ÄúHer Breath on the Windowpane,‚Äù was selected for publication in The Best American Short Stories 1950. In 1952, when the French translation was published, it won the French Halperin-Kaminsky Prize.

The $2.2‚Äìmillion grant was appropriated for renovations and additions to the building. The project involved adding and enlarging classrooms, accumulating more restrooms, and building internal and external accesses for the handicapped. This addition was needed for the increase in students and courses in the communication department since the opening of Williams Hall.Smith, Tina. \\"Williams Hall Gets Renovation Grant.\\" Digital Collections - Miami University Libraries.

At the same time that construction was happening on Williams Hall, Gaskill, Boyd, and Robertson halls were also being modernized, totaling a $6.5 million renovation. Williams Hall ended up using $3.1 million of this (including the $2.2 million grant) because of changes needed to meet stricter codes.Kruggel, Jim. \\"Williams to Re-open in December.\\" Digital Collections - Miami University Libraries.

Players are tasked with leading a group of survivors living in a shelter in the fictional town of Splendid, Texas. Dead State was released in December 2014 after having been in Early Access since spring of that year. DoubleBear Productions continued to work on the title and in May 2015 released an \\"enhanced edition\\" which changed the name to Dead State: Reanimated.  Gameplay  Dead State splits its time between scavenging - where the player explores the environment for food, fuel, luxury items, medical supplies, and antibiotics - and base management back at the Shelter - assigning jobs, building upgrades, creating items, and interacting with fellow survivors. Standard action in Dead State is in real-time, switching into turn-based mode when combat initiates.  Character creation  Character Creation consists of two stages. Initially, the player chooses their character's gender, 3D appearance, portrait (either from a pre-generated list, uploading an image, or using the custom portrait generator), and name. After this, the player has a choice of either selecting an archetype that fits a certain play style, or distributing character points manually.  Character advancement  Players are able to advance their skills and stats not by killing creatures, but by completing various goals, such as investigating areas, collecting a certain amount of food, resolving a conflict, and so on. Ally characters gain 1 skill point for each day they're at the Shelter, which are automatically distributed based on their preset character personalities. While the player is unable to distribute their points, for some allies, they are able to influence the development of some ally characters based upon their actions. The maximum level for character development is capped at 20 - by this point, the character will also have reached 170 attribute points. Players may also choose to do certain quests to gain another 30 attribute points, making the maximum points available 200. Experience can still be gained and is used to learn more skills or buy consumable items throughout the game.  Combat  Combat in Dead State is fully turn-based, utilizing an Action Point system that draws from a character's Agility stat, and relies on character initiative to determine turn order. It also employs a \\"Line of Sight\\" scenario - if no allies or enemies can see each other, they do not appear on the map. Once one is sighted, they appear - but combat does not initiate until the enemy either detects the player or an ally, or the player manually initiates combat. The player character can select up to three other characters to accompany in the field: early builds of the game experimented with AI-controlled allies, but the end product had fully controllable ally characters. The game also features perma- death, meaning that if one of your allies is killed, they stay dead, and there is no way to revive them. However, if the player character is killed, the game is over. Dead State features combat against both the undead and other factions of human enemies. While undead only come in two forms - walkers and crawlers - they move at a uniform rate, and are not very dangerous in small numbers. Both allies and enemies can be infected if they are pulled down by the undead and attacked while their health is low, and when killed, infected characters will reanimated as zombies themselves. (Players cannot be infected unless they choose the \\"Player Infection\\" mode in the Reanimated update.) Human enemies are far more dangerous, falling into a variety of factions from frightened looters to biker gangs to rogue military - each with their own varying stat and skill levels, weapons, and items. There are both melee and ranged weapons: any character can use any weapon, but their skill with it will depend on the applicable stats and skills for each (Melee - Strength stat and Melee skill; Ranged - Perception stat and Ranged skill). Melee weapons often have multiple different attacks, which can do variant damage based on a character's angle of attack, and whether or not the target is human or undead. Ranged weapons often lack the multiple different attacks of melee, but some can get modifications that improve their utility in combat. A key factor within the combat in Dead State is the Noise Meter, which sits on the upper left of the screen and measures how much of a racket is being made. Undead and humans alike are attracted to noise, and raising the Noise Meter too high will result in undead spawning on the edges of the map, and moving towards the source of the sound. Players eventually discover items to allow them to manipulate noise, such as firecrackers and noisemakers, and can utilize them to lure enemies towards one another or away from a lootable area.  Reanimated changes  Released on May 13, 2015, the free Reanimated update included a significant amount of updates and improvements, including a full combat rebalance, improved animations, better AI, new areas, new gameplay modes, and stability and pathfinding improvements. The free demo of the game was later updated with the Reanimated content as well. Plot Dead State is centered in the fictional town of Splendid, and the gameplay area covers a significant amount of the center of the state - this ranges from Abilene (north), San Angelo (west), and Austin (southeast). The game begins sometime in the modern day, in the spring, and lasts over a period of about four months. Set at the beginning of the undead apocalypse, the player is involved in a plane crash over central Texas near the fictional town of Splendid, and are saved by a small group of survivors that have taken refuge at the local public school and made it their Shelter. As society is beginning to fall apart, the player must organize a handful of allies, work on fortifying the school into a livable long-term shelter, scouting for food and supplies, making uncertain alliances with others, and attempting to hold together a group as humanity teeters on the brink of extinction. And although the undead lurk as an ever present environmental threat, the biggest obstacle to the player are other humans with the same goal: survival at any cost.  Development  Dead State began development in Summer 2009 as a collaboration between the newly formed DoubleBear Productions and Iron Tower Studio, with writer/designer Brian Mitsoda as the project lead. The game utilized The Age of Decadence's game engine, although it was later upgraded to Torque 3D. The game initially carried the working title of \\"ZRPG\\", but was updated with the formal title of Dead State when it was formally announced a year later. Designer Brian Mitsoda stated that the game was intended to be very dynamic, with each playthrough forming a unique experience. Mitsoda's own experiences living in Miami, Florida during Hurricane Andrew were an influence on the game design, as he intended to \\"work it into a broader examination of how humans deal with a crisis beyond their control.\\" On June 5, 2012, DoubleBear started a campaign on the crowdfunding site, Kickstarter, seeking $150,000 to fund the development of the game. The campaign ended one month later on July 5, having collected $332,635; 221% of the original goal. The game was first shown at the Indie Megabooth for PAX Prime 2013 with a playable demo showing, and showed there again the following year. On February 14, 2014, DoubleBear Productions launched an early access demo of Dead State on Steam. Dead State: The First Seven Days was an early preview of the first week of Dead State‚Äôs gameplay as an opportunity for the player to prepare their strategy and allow the early access players to test and polish the game. Dead State entered active beta on Steam on August 27, 2014, and has had consistent patches and updates since the Early Access release in February. Dead State was released on Steam and GOG.com on December 4, 2014, and was picked as PC Gamer writer Evan Lahti's 2014 Personal Pick. The game has had multiple updates since its release, the largest of those being the Reanimated release. As with that and all other patches and updates, they have been released for free to the owners of the game. Although the Reanimated patch was the final update for Dead State, Iron Tower Studios assisted with creating a Russian language translation of the game. Brian Mitsoda also penned a postmortem of the game on Gamasutra, and the team spoke about it on a panel at PAX Dev 2015.

Location  Flower‚Äôs Barrow is located about west of Swanage and about south-west of Wareham. Towering to the north over Worbarrow Bay is Flower‚Äôs Barrow ridge. This forms the western end of the ridge which runs all the way to Ballard Point north of Swanage. The ancient hillfort of Flower's Barrow rises behind the beach at Arish Mell. The hill lies directly west of the ghost village of Tyneham. Flower‚Äôs Barrow has a limited future because the southern part is falling into the sea at Worbarrow Bay due to coastal erosion. Probably more than half of it has already disappeared. Access to Flower‚Äôs Barrow hillfort is solely possible by foot, either from Tyneham, with a steep uphill walk, or alternatively from the viewing point and car park at Whiteway Hill walking along the hill to the west. Flower‚Äôs Barrow is only accessible when the Lulworth Ranges are open to the public. The ranges are owned by the Ministry of Defence and are part of the Armoured Fighting Vehicles Gunnery School. The more than ranges lie within an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and stretches along the coastline between Lulworth Cove to just west of Kimmeridge. Safety warnings about explosives and unexploded shells are posted around the site by the MoD, and visitors are advised to keep to official footpaths and abide to local site notices, because tanks and armoured vehicles are used in this area.  Hillfort  This early Iron Age hillfort, taken over by the Romans when they invaded, has double and triple ramparts. The parallel double ramparts on the east and west flanks are connected along the northern border and are unmistakably visible. Because the cliff face acted as defence, it is probable that there were never ramparts along the southern end. Several sections of the interior of the hillfort have been exposed following coastal erosion. Hut circles are visible within the interior of the fort. During a minor excavation in 1939 fragments of Iron Age pottery, as well as sling- stones and bones were found in a pit near the western entrance. Subsequent landslides have revealed the floor of the hillfort. The continual ground disturbances at the southern fringe increase the possibility of further archaeological finds. However, the twin hazards of the cliff erosion and the possibility of unexploded military shells from the Lulworth Ranges command extreme caution. Visitors are warned to keep to the footpaths and between the yellow MoD markers.  Geology  Geology of the coast line by Flower's Barrow and Arish Mell The steep angular layers of rock, that are clearly visible in the bay, reveal the complex sedimentary folding that disturbed the geology in this vicinity. These folds were caused by tectonic pressures some 30 million years ago as the African and European continents collided. At this time the cliff sediments were twisted horizontally and this is why the Chalks that are between 85 and 145 million years old are found at the rear of the bay. The sediments that form Mupe Ledges, the Mupe Rocks and the peninsula Worbarrow Tout are 150-million-year-old Portland Limestone and 147-million-year-old Purbeck Beds.

Edapalli Rajas had no civil or criminal authority within the principality. He is entitled to all the revenue from his lands, and holds them free of tax or tribute to Travancore. Elangallur Swarupam is one of only two Brahmin royalties in Kerala. Edappally Rajas were great patrons of temples and also known as Edappally Thampurans (Lords of Edappally). They built temples such as the Ganapathy temple at Edappally, Sastha Temple at Thrikkunnapuzha (near Cherthala in Alleppey district) and Perandoor Bhagavathy Temple. According to local legends and myths, the last king of the Later Chera dynasty divided his kingdom among his various chieftains and governors. At the last minute, he realized that he had not given any land to his royal priests- the Elangallur Namboothiris. He then took back some land from the other lords and gave it to the royal priest family. A new dynasty was created - the Elangalllur swaroopam or the Kingdom of the Elangallur family in Edappally.  Kallooppaara or Perumbranad district  The old Vempolinad was separated into 'Vadakumkoor' and 'Thekkumkoor' in AD 1100. Kottayam, Chenganacherry, Thiruvalla, Kanjirapally and some places of high range where included in Thekkumkoor kingdom. Kallooppara was under the control of the Thekkumkoor dynasty. It had Kalari (training center for material arts) at Kallooppara. The Kalari was known as Thekkumkoor Fort which existed until recently. The Thekkumkoor Army camped here and it was risky for the enemy to attack them. It is said that the King had many close friends in Kallooppara and its surroundings. The Old Nair lord Family at Koipuram in Eraviperoor was in close touch with the kings. It was this Nair Lord family who had great influence on the king and inspired him to donate the Kallooppara sub-division to the Edappally dynasty. With the withdrawal of Thekkumkoor Kings, Kallooppara came under the Edappally dynasty, which is also known as Elangalloor Swaroopam. The Edappally Dynasty has the history of elevation of a temple priest to the royal position of a King. The founder of the Edappally dynasty was a priest of Thrikkakara temple according to the historical evidence and proverbs. The St. Marys Valiyapally known kalloopparapally was formed with a tent \\"for prayer purpose\\", with permission of Edappally Raja in AD 1339 (karkkidam 3 kollavarsham 515). The Edapally King one evening sadly noted the sacrifice of Nasrani Christians of taking dead body being transported via Manimala River to Niranam Church, (Niranam church was formed by Saint Thomas, one of the disciples of Jesus Christ in around AD 52-54). The King gave permission to have a body buried on the land which is west of the Temple, called as \\"Thamarassery Purayidam\\". A small group of Christians \\"Aaru Veedan families\\" were present in the area by the river, decided to build a tent to have a prayer group at that burial location. Over the years this location became a center for Christians to gather and pray, and the name of the church became Saint Mary's Orthodox Syrian Church in around AD 1666, at the arrival of a prominent Bishop from Syria \\"Abdul Jaleel Mor Greegorius\\". It is interesting that even today Christians at Kallooppara (nine km from Thiruvalla), Karthikappally, etc. still remember the Edappally Swaroopam for the many privileges received from him and to-date portions of the Edappally Madhom palace on the Manimala riverbank at Kallooppara attracts visitors. This \\"Madham\\" or \\"local court\\" was there with 2 stories for the purpose of undertaking local judicial matters. The \\"Muthalpady\\" who was appointed by the Edappally King ruled Perumbranad district, for the tax collections and various local judicial matters. In AD 1669 a family from Sankara Puri \\"Avirah Tharakan\\" who was married to the niece of Edappally King \\"Sridevi\\" (after accepting Christianity, she was named \\"Maria\\") was settled down in Puramattom \\"Perumpra Nadu district\\". Sridevi's parents (Kishan Bhattathiri and Devaky Antharjanam) were also resided at the selected location that was vacated by \\"Tharamel Illam\\" and rebuilt by the King for the purpose of these royal couple to reside. After the arrival of Avirah Tharakan of Sankara Puri there were many Christian families started migrating to Kallooppara region under the direction of Avirah Tharakan and his son Itty Avirah Tharakan, Kallupurackal from Kuravilangad, Vyakkam areas. Edappally King had given Avirah Tharakan and Sridevi/Maria the full authority of Perumbranadu district, which was consist of over 9 villages. The second generation of Avirah Tharakan was named as \\"Adangapurathu\\" by their son Itty Avirah Tharakan, who had built a house at Kallooppara Madattumbagam south, in around AD 1720. The Adangapurathu family retained the control of Perumbranadu district as \\"Muthalpady\\" for many years until AD 1815. The last person held that position was Adangapurathu Avira Avira Panicker \\"Olesseril Kochoojnachan\\", who was the elder son of Avira Avira Valiya Panicker. (see the website of http://www.adangapurathu.com). It is interesting that the Bhagavathy temple and the Old church at Kallooppara are practically in the same piece of land and the church's architecture is one of the best examples for Kerala Vasthu Shilpa style (For photographs of The St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India, Vol. II, 1973, ed. George Menachery). These two establishments (Bhagavathy temple and Saint Mary's Orthodox church) members are well respected each other and many traditional practices are still in existence when major religious functions take place. Historical exchanges of prayer and other means of offerings are still in practice by both members of these 2 religious establishments for many years. It may be presumed that sometime in the 12th century with end of Kulasekhara Perumals, Elangalloor Swaroopam usurped power in the region of Edapally and by the mid-14th century they held sway over erstwhile Thekkumkoor. Thus, they became a state (with little authority but vast landed property outside). This made Edapally the seat of the Brahmin Kings a bone of contention between Zamorin and others. As Zamorin could not wage battles against a Brahmin, in 1536, the first sacking of Edapally took place under Martin D'Souza. The lingering presence of Edapally continues to be mentioned in Portuguese records and VOC or Dutch East India Company Records. Edapally Raja continued customary rights over the church and land was given tax free to church. This is a proof that land was still owned by him. One of the earliest local history initiatives centred on the study of the relationship between Edapally church and Elangalloor Swaroopam. In a small book published I 1990s by Poulose Madekkal in Malayalam, he has given evidence by consulting the church archives to which he had access and tried to establish the miracles of the church influencing the Edapally kings to support the church. visit: www.adangapurathu.com, for much more details about Perumpranad district.

The temple was built by the Cholas kingdom in the 12th century AD. The main deity is Lord Thanthondreeswarar (Lord Shiva) and the female deity is Goddess Dharmasamvarthini. Thanthondreeswarar Temple is located on the banks of Vasishta Nadi (Vasishta River). The temple has a serene atmosphere and is surrounded by beautiful hillocks. This temple comes under the Hindu Religious Charitable Endowment Department.  History  The inner sanctum was constructed by 'Milagu Chetty' and the rest were constructed by King Paranthaga Chola (Paranthaka Chola). Construction of Rajagopuram was started during the 12th century by King Paranthaka Chola, but was left incomplete. It also showcases the Dravidian architecture and is representative of the Chola Empire's Ideology and the Tamil civilisation.  Legend  Manickam Chetty, a pepper merchant was living near a village close to the temple. His job was carrying loads of pepper and selling it in the market place. One day he was crossing this dense forest where the shrine is located at present. As darkness sunk in, he wanted to take rest. In order to eat, he crossed pea aubergine (Sundaikai, an edible vegetable) with a stone. Suddenly he heard a voice saying, \\"The stone hurts my head. Apply some pepper on my head. Bewildered by this incident, the merchant said that he did not have any pepper and added that he had only Black Gram (Ulundu). Next day he proceeded to the market place and opened his baggage. He was shocked to find black gram instead of pepper. He worshipped God and prayed for His forgiveness. God asked him to bring some mud from the place where he had crushed pea aubergine (sundaikai) and spray it in the baggage containing black gram. He followed His instructions and black gram transformed into pepper again.\\" On his way back, out of curiosity, he examined the place where he took rest. He was surprised to find a Suyambu Lingam (Lingam which originates by itself from earth). He worshipped the Lord and it is believed that the inner sanctum of the temple was built by him. Henceforth he was called Milagu Chetty (Milagu means Pepper) and the place where pepper transformed into black gram is called Ulundurpettai. The place has retained its name since then. As per history the inner sanctum was constructed by Milagu chetty and the rest was constructed by king Paranthaga chola. This has been mentioned in the book \\"The Manual Of Salem District in the Presidency of Madras\\" by Lee Fanu and the same idea has been endorsed by Dr. Busnagi Rajannan, a History professor.  Rajagopuram  The Rajagopuram is about 97 feet tall having 7 stages(floors). Consecration Ceremony (Kumbabishekam) for the new Rajagopuram was performed on 24 February 2002. Belur Temple Tower.  Brahmanda Purana  Brahmanda purana is one of the 18 puranas in Sanskrit and is written by the great saint, Vedha Vyasa. In 130th chapter of this purana, Sudamuni narrated the glory of Lord and this temple to his disciples and other saints.  Kanampulla Nayanar  Kanampullar, one of the Nayanmars hailed from a rich family in this same village. He was a sincere devotee of Sri Thanthondreeswarar. He considered lighting lamps in this temple as his prime duty and did it with utmost dedication. He went through a rough phase and lost all his wealth. Poverty drove him to Thirpuliswaram and he continued lighting lamps in a Shiva temple there. To earn his living, he used to cut a kind of grass called Kanampul and sell it in the market. He spent his meagre income on oil and wicks. Lord Shiva decided to test his devotion. One day his grass was not sold and he did not have enough money to buy oil and wick to light the lamps. He used his locks of hair as wick in the lamp and lighted it. Extremely pleased with the supreme devotion of Kanampullar, Shiva appeared in front of him and he became one with God. A statue of Kanampullar holding a lamp can be seen in this temple in front of Pradhosha Nandi (The Devine Bull). He is the 48th among the Nayanmars. This adds to the pride of Belur.

The compound is used in organic chemistry as a reagent in the synthesis of many important natural products including sterols, trisporic acids, and terpenoids.  Preparation   Hagemann's approach  Methylene iodide and two equivalents of acetoacetic ester react in the presence of sodium methoxide to form the diethyl ester of 2,4-diacetyl pentane. This precursor is treated with base to induce cyclization. Finally, heat is applied to generate Hagemann's ester.  Knoevenagel's approach  Soon after Hagemann, Emil Knoevenagel presented the following modified procedure. Formaldehyde and two equivalents of acetoacetic ester undergo condensation in the presence of catalytic piperidine to produce the diethyl ester of 2,4-diacetyl pentane. This precursor is treated with base to induce cyclization. Finally, heat is applied to generate Hagemann's ester.  Newman and Lloyd approach  2-Methoxy-1,3-butadiene and ethyl-2-butynoate undergo a Diels Alder reaction to generate a precursor. The precursor is hydrolyzed to obtain Hagemann's ester. By varying the substituents on the butynoate starting material, this approach allows for different C2 alkylated Hagemann's ester derivatives to be synthesized.  Mannich and Forneau approach   Original  Methyl vinyl ketone, acetoacetic ester, and diethyl- methyl-(3-oxo-butyl)-ammonium iodide react to form a cyclic aldol product. Sodium methoxide is added to generate Hagemann's ester.  Variations  Methyl vinyl ketone and acetoacetic ester undergo aldol cyclization in the presence of catalytic pyrrolidinum acetate or Triton B or sodium ethoxide to produce Hagemann's ester.

Hill, Easterlin revisited: Relative income and the baby boom, Explorations in Economic History, Volume 56, April 2015, Pages 71-85. The hypothesis as formulated by Richard Easterlin presumes that material aspirations are determined by experiences rooted in family background: he assumes first that young couples try to achieve a standard of living equal to or better than they had when they grew up. This is called \\"relative status\\". If income is high relative to aspirations and jobs are plentiful, it will be easier to marry young and have more children and still match that standard of living. But when jobs are scarce, couples who try to keep that standard of living will wait to get married and have fewer children. Children are normal goods once this influence of family background is controlled. For Easterlin, the size of the cohort is a critical determinant of how easy it is to get a good job. A small cohort means less competition, a large cohort means more competition to worry about. The assumptions blend economics and sociology.Diane J.

These mutations are distinct from fusion genes which merge whole gene sequences into a single reading frame and often retain their original functions. Formation Chimeric genes can form through several different means. Many chimeric genes form through errors in DNA replication or DNA repair so that pieces of two different genes are inadvertently combined.Rogers, RL, Bedford, T and Hartl DL. \\"Formation and Longevity of Chimeric and Duplicat Genes in Drosphila\\". Genetics. 181: 313-322. Chimeric genes can also form through retrotransposition where a retrotransposon accidentally copies the transcript of a gene and inserts it into the genome in a new location. Depending on where the new retrogene appears, it can recruit new exons to produce a chimeric gene. Finally, ectopic recombination, when there is an exchange between portions of the genome that are not actually related, can also produce chimeric genes. This process occurs often in human genomes, and abnormal chimeras formed by this process are known to cause color blindness. Evolutionary Importance of Fusion Proteins Chimeric genes are important players in the evolution of genetic novelty. Much like gene duplications, they provide a source of new genes, which can allow organisms to develop new phenotypes and adapt to their environment. Unlike duplicate genes, chimeric proteins are immediately distinct from their parental genes, and therefore are more likely to produce entirely new functions. Chimeric fusion proteins form often in genomes, and many of these are likely to be dysfunctional and eliminated by natural selection. However, in some cases, these new peptides can form fully functional gene products that are selectively favored and spread through populations quickly. Functions One of the most well known chimeric genes was identified in Drosophila and has been named Jingwei.Long, M., C. H. Langley 1993. \\"Natural selection and the origin of jingwei, a chimeric processed functional gene in Drosophila.\\" Science 260: 91-95. This gene is formed from a retrotransposed copy of Alcohol dehydrogenase that united with the yellow emperor gene to produce a new protein. The new amino acid residues that it recruited from yellow emperor allow the new protein to act on long chain alcohols and diols, including growth hormones and pheremones.Zhang J, Dean AM, Brunet F, Long M. 2004. \\"Evolving protein functional diversity in new genes of Drosophila.\\" Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 101: 16246-50. These changes affect fly development. In this case, the combination of different protein domains resulted in a gene that was fully functional and favored by selection. The functions of many chimeric genes are not yet known. In some cases these gene products are not beneficial and they may even cause diseases such as cancer.

It is based on a showcase of Unreal Engine 3 named Dungeon Defense.Dungeon Defense on Unreal Development Kit. Retrieved April 4, 2012. The game takes place in a fantasy setting where players control the young apprentices of wizards and warriors and defend against hordes of monsters. The sequel Dungeon Defenders II was released in 2015. Gameplay Dungeon Defenders is a mix of tower defense, role-playing, and action-adventure where one to four players work together to protect one or more Eternia Crystals from being destroyed by waves of enemies which include goblins, orcs, kobolds, ogres, and wyverns. The game features a number of levels, consisting of around five total waves, through its campaign mode, or other levels as part of challenges; some of these levels may feature a final wave that includes a boss battle against a unique foe. The player characters defend crystals by either magically creating, maintaining, and upgrading towers or other defensive elements that damage or divert the enemy monsters, or by using melee and ranged attacks to defeat enemies directly. On easier difficulties, players have an indefinite amount of time prior to a wave to study the level's map to see where monsters will come from and the type or number of monsters, to place traps and defenses, and to manage the characters' equipment. Traps and defenses are limited by the available mana that the character has - more mana can be obtained by defeating monsters or opening chests that appear between waves - as well as a total \\"defense value\\" for the level, limiting the number of traps that can be placed. The characters can be damaged by enemy attacks, and can be killed in battle but will respawn after a few seconds, unless hardcore mode is selected. If an Eternia Crystal has taken too much damage, it will be destroyed and the players will lose that level. Successfully defending a wave will earn the characters experience points based on the difficulty plus additional bonuses, namely preventing any damage to the crystals, preventing damage to your character, and only using weapons to kill monsters; successfully completing all waves of a level will earn the players a large banked mana boost. Monsters will also drop items that can be sold for additional banked mana. The difficulty of the level is set by the hosting player after choosing a level; the strength, number, and types of monsters that are faced are influenced by this selection and the number of players in the match, as well as the quality of the equipment that may be generated as rewards. The player has additional options, such as removing the indefinite time between waves, instead forcing players to prepare for an upcoming wave on a countdown timer. For the campaign levels, players must work through each level before unlocking the next, but may return to earlier levels to try to improve their performance, challenge the level at a higher difficulty, or simply to grind for better rewards. Characters are persistent for a player. The player can manage any number of characters, though characters are kept separate between Trendy's ranked servers and for unranked play. Characters are selected from the available character classes: four were shipped with the game, while additional classes have been added in the form of downloadable content on the Microsoft Windows version. Each class has a unique set of traps or defenses, a specific set of weapons that they can equip, and two special abilities they can use in combat. As the character levels up with banked mana experience, the player can allocate points among a range of characteristics affecting the character or the traps or defenses they lay out. Additional bonuses to these characteristics can come from the equipment the character is equipped with. New equipment can be purchased using banked mana either in the game's store or in other player's auctions, dropped by killing monsters, or collected as rewards after defeating waves of enemies. Banked mana can be spent to upgrade equipment, allowing the player to improve the bonuses that the equipment provides to the characters. The player maintains separate inventories of equipment across the ranked and unranked servers, but this inventory will be common for all of the player's characters in that mode. Release Dungeon Defenders was announced on August 25, 2010, and has been released on Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network and PC. Support for the Move accessory is planned for inclusion in the PlayStation Network version. Epic Games' Mark Rein has stated that there will be cross platform play between the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation Vita. The game was released on October 19, 2011 through Steam. In November there was a \\"development kit\\" released as free DLC which included the game's source code.Trendy Entertainment Offers Complete Dungeon Defenders Dev Kit And Source Code As Free DLC by Indie-Game-Freak (November 12, 2011) Reception Critical reception Dungeon Defenders received generally favourable reviews. At review aggregator website Metacritic, the game attained overall scores of 81, 80 and 77 out of 100 for PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 respectively. Sales Dungeon Defenders sold over 250,000 copies in first two weeks of release and over 600,000 copies by the end of 2011. By February 2012, the game's publisher reported over one million sales across Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and Steam. Dungeon Defenders: First/Second Wave First Wave is the mobile version of Dungeon Defenders, and was one of the first Unreal Engine 3 games available for iOS and the first available on Android, with a recent patch allowing cross-platform multiplayer gaming between the two mobile operating systems via GameSpy. Second Wave was a mobile version of Dungeon Defenders. It was free on the Google Play Market, but paid on the App Store. It featured a revamped menu system and improved controls. As of December 2012 it is no longer available from the Google Play Market. Dungeon Defenders Eternity Dungeon Defenders Eternity was released on 22 July 2014. It rebalanced the heroes and enemies of Dungeon Defenders and redesigned the loot system of the original game. It includes an early version of Playverse, the server system designed for Dungeon Defenders 2 to improve cross-platform support and discourage hacking. The game received predominantly negative reviews from customers from Steam due to the lack of a single player game and inclusion of micro-transactions on the first day of release. Sequels Dungeon Defenders II was announced for PC and PlayStation 4, prior to the 2013 PAX East convention, to be playable there and starting a beta period. The sequel features similar gameplay. The game is free-to-play with microtransactions to unlock certain heroes that are otherwise earnable through play. Dungeon Defenders 2 was released on Steam early access on December 5, 2014, and became available on PlayStation 4 on September 19, 2015. The game was released out of Early Access as a fully launched product and was also released for the Xbox One on June 20, 2017. Dungeon Defenders: Awakened was announced in March 2019 by Chromatic Games, the new name for Trendy after some corporate rearrangement. It was initially backed by a successful Kickstarter that same month. The game, while narratively set after Dungeon Defenders II, will return to the graphics and playstyle established by the first game, but with several additional gameplay updates. The game is expected to launch on Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch in the first quarter of 2020, with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions to come out the following quarter. Players that pre-ordered the game for any platform gained access to the beta version of the title, which launched November 22, 2019 on Microsoft Windows. The game will launch in Steam's early access on February 21, 2020.

The film depicts WWI veteran Jamie McFarland (played by Neil Hamilton) and his search for meaning in his last six months to live, and Molly Campbell (played by Betty Furness), a young woman looking to save her sister's child from being left alone. It also features Emma Dunn as Margaret Campbell, Molly's charming mother and Edith Fellows as Jean-Marie \\"Little Scout\\" (not to be confused with Scout Finch), an adventurous young girl trying to fit in with her male friends.  Plot  James \\"Jamie\\" Lewis McFarland is a veteran of the First World War whose damaged lungs means he only has six more months to live. Inspired by a nurse at the hospital he finds himself trapped in, he insists on living his last days in grand fashion and sneaks out of the hospital with the help of this nurse. On the way, he catches a ride from a good-looking young woman who catches his fancy. After riding in her car for a bit, she leaves him by the side of the road. Unfazed and fascinated by her remarkably blue eyes, he follows her to Peaceful Bay, where he comes across the house of an old beekeeper who is in critically poor health. While Jamie seeks medical attention for the man, the Beekeeper instructs him to take care of his bees while he's away at the hospital, assuring him that his partner in beekeeping will come by soon to help. After the Beekeeper is taken away, his partner introduces himself as 10-year old \\"Little Scout,\\" an enthusiastic young child with much knowledge of the keeping and maintenance of bees. He teaches Jamie the ways of the ranch and introduced him to his friends, who enjoy acting as a mock military battalion. He also meets his neighbor Ms. Campbell, a charming mother figure who takes care of him and treats him as she would a son. It is revealed in a separate scene that she has been missing her daughter for several months and that her daughter is the woman Jamie had gotten a ride from earlier. That night, while on a walk, Jamie runs into this woman, crying to herself. After imploring her to tell him what's wrong, she admits that she needs to become legally married to someone for some undisclosed reason. Realizing that he's falling in love with her, he agrees to marry her if only legally. Despite his best efforts, she refuses to tell him her name. The next day, they are married at the courthouse, where Jamie learns that the mystery woman's name is \\"Louise\\". The woman immediately leaves Jamie and he returns to his bees, disappointed. A series of rapid events quickly shakes his world: First, the old Beekeeper falls ill and dies, surprisingly leaving half of his possessions to Jamie and the other half to Little Scout, including the bees and their surrounding property. Little Scout admits to Jamie that she is actually a girl trying to blend in with the neighborhood boys, which leads him to encourage her to do what she wants as herself and not under a guise. Finally, Jamie receives a call telling him that his \\"wife\\" has just given birth and is ill. He rushes to the hospital and finds a woman he's never met in the hospital bed, apologizing for never explaining to him the situation before dying. He returns to the house with a baby and a renewed confusion about the situation. Soon, the young woman to whom he is married arrives and reveals to him the whole story: that she is actually Molly Campbell (the niece of Ms. Campbell) and Louise is her cousin, the one who died in the hospital giving birth. Molly needed a marriage certificate, which she obtained by marrying Jamie as Louise, in order to save her cousin from others shaming her for having a baby outside of marriage. She wanted to keep this news from her mother to save her from the grief. Ms. Campbell hears anyway, but decides to not reveal this, instead opting to simply \\"have faith.\\"  Differences from novel  The film features significantly less religious themes than the novel does, often omitting any overt religious references from the film's plot and dialogue. For example, this excerpt from the novel: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be bitter, Margaret. We don‚Äôt know why, we never can know why things happen in this world exactly as they do; but this we know: We know that God is in His Heaven, that He is merciful to the extent of ordaining mercy; we know that if we disobey and take our own way and run contrary to His commandments, we are bitterly punished.\\" is portrayed in the film by a scene of Jamie simply hugging Ms. Campbell and offering her his condolences rather than quoting or invoking any religious text to her.

He previously played for the Seattle Mariners and Arizona Diamondbacks. Amateur career Born in Shreveport, Louisiana, Walker's original love was basketball, until he began playing baseball at the age of 11. Walker attended Yucaipa High School in Yucaipa, California, where he was a pitcher and shortstop, as well as a two-sport athlete. At Yucaipa, Walker was teammates with Matt Davidson, a third baseman in the Cincinnati Reds organization. Yucaipa is also the alma mater of former major leaguers Corky Miller and Mark Teahen. Professional career Seattle Mariners The Seattle Mariners selected Walker in the first round, with the 43rd overall pick, of the 2010 MLB draft. Walker and the Mariners agreed to a deal that included an $800,000 signing bonus. He made four appearances for the Rookie League AZL Mariners, all in relief, and went 1‚Äì1 with a 1.29 earned run average (ERA). Walker was listed as one of the Mariners' top 10 prospects for the 2011 season, ranked fourth according to Baseball America.Organization Top 10 prospects: Seattle Mariners 2011 Prior to the 2012 season, he was ranked the second best prospect in the Mariners organization and the 20th best overall.Seattle Mariners top 2012 prospects Walker was selected to play in the 2012 All-Star Futures Game. After Walker pitched to a 5‚Äì3 win‚Äìloss record and a 3.61 ERA with 64 strikeouts in innings pitched for the Tacoma Rainiers of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League, the Mariners promoted Walker on August 30, 2013. Walker pitched 5 innings against the Houston Astros, and yielded just 2 hits and struck out 2. Walker was called up when rosters expanded in September 2013. He started 3 games, finishing the season with a 3.60 ERA in 15 innings. On September 24, 2014, Walker pitched his first MLB complete game, allowing one run in a 1‚Äì0 loss against the Toronto Blue Jays at Rogers Centre. Walker began the 2015 season as a member of the Mariners starting rotation. In his first start, at Oakland, Walker gave up nine runs in innings. He followed that outing by giving up 5 runs in 4 innings against the Dodgers, causing some to question whether or not Walker was ready for the big leagues. Walker continued to struggle, pitching more than 6 innings only once through his first nine starts. However, Walker won five straight starts in June and July, improving his record from 2-6 to 7-6. Walker struggled after winning five straight, going 0-1 with an 8.02 ERA, but on July 31, he threw a complete game one-hitter (his only hit was a home run by Miguel Sano) against the Minnesota Twins at Target Field. This time, his offense backed him up, as he won 6-1, striking out 11 only needing 100 pitches to do so. Overall, Walker finished the 2015 season with an 11-8 record despite posting a 4.56 ERA in 29 starts. Throughout the first half of the 2016 season, Walker battled with a foot injury. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list on two occasions. He began the second half of the season on the disabled list. Before the all star break, Walker had a 4-7 record despite a 3.66 ERA and 80 strikeouts in 86 innings. Walker was optioned to AAA on August 8, 2016. On September 13, 2016, Walker pitched his first career complete-game shutout in an 8-0 Mariners win over the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He carried a perfect game into the sixth inning and a no-hitter into the seventh, finishing the game allowing no walks and three hits while striking out eleven batters. Arizona Diamondbacks On November 23, 2016, the Mariners traded Walker and Ketel Marte to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Jean Segura, Mitch Haniger, and Zac Curtis. In his first season in Arizona, Walker made 28 starts, pitching to a 9-9 record in 157 innings. On April 15, 2018, Walker was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to right forearm tightness. Two days later, on April 17, it was revealed that Walker was diagnosed with a UCL injury in his right elbow. On April 18, it was revealed that Walker had a partial tear of the UCL in his right elbow. With the injury, it required Tommy John surgery, bringing Walker's 2018 season to a premature end. Following his Tommy John surgery, he appeared in one game, the final game of the season, for the Diamondbacks. On December 2, 2019, Walker was non-tendered by Arizona and became a free agent. On February 4, 2020, Walker worked out for 20 scouts from Major League teams. Second Stint with the Seattle Mariners On February 12, 2020, Walker signed a one-year contract for $2 million to return to the Seattle Mariners. Toronto Blue Jays On August 27, 2020, the Mariners traded Walker to the Toronto Blue Jays for a player to be named later or cash considerations. On August 29, 2020, he made his Blue Jays debut against the Baltimore Orioles, he threw 6 scoreless innings, allowing only 4 hits.

Knockavoe was not a lost pitched battle, rather it was in fact the result of a nighttime surprise attack on the O'Neill camp by the O'Donnells. Knockavoe is the hill just behind Strabane in County Tyrone. Background Conn Bacach O'Neill (who was later created Earl of Tyrone, in 1542) was determined to bring the O'Donnells under his rule and made a great gathering, determined to march into Tyrconnell. Forces arrived from Munster and Connacht, together with English contingents, and brought into O'Neill's army itself were the Scoto-Irish MacDonnells of Antrim, Bissetts, MacSheehys and others. The forces laid siege to and took Ballyshannon Castle, and later devastated a large part of Tyrconnell. Battle While encamped at Knockavoe, on the outskirts of Strabane, Conn O'Neill's forces were surprised at night by Hugh Dubh O'Donnell and Manus O'Donnell. Hugh and Manus led their small force quietly up to the campsite and launched a surprise attack before the sentinels were aware of how matters stood, with the two forces fighting furiously in pitch darkness in the midst of the camp. After a long and fearful struggle, in which men found it hard to distinguish friend from foe, the completely unprepared O'Neills and their supporters were routed with a loss of 900 men; and O'Donnell took possession of the camp, with an immense quantity of booty. The full account of the battle is contained in The Annals of the Four Masters as follows:‚Äî Notes: Cnoc-Buidhbh, or the Hill of Bove Derg, is the old Gaelic name for Knockavoe. Loch Monann was a lake that later burst out and formed Strabane Glen. Druim-Lighean refers to Drumboy Hill, just beyond Lifford, on the Letterkenny Road. Aftermath The battle was one of the bloodiest ever fought between the O'Donnells and O'Neills, did not end the quarrel. Lord Kildare, who was Conn Bacach O'Neill's first cousin, tried to make peace; but in spite of his efforts the war continued for many years afterwards.

Fred Guiol directed seven of the eight films, the exception being 1951's As You Were. The leads were played by William Tracy and Joe Sawyer, with co-stars James Gleason, Noah Beery, Jr. and Elyse Knox. Plot Dodo Doubleday has been inexplicably reduced from first sergeant to staff sergeant and has resumed being orderly to his regimental commander Colonel Barkley. Sergeant Ames is still a buck sergeant who hates Dodo because he advanced to outrank Ames within Dodo's first 24 hours in the army. Dodo's former comrade in arms Charlie Cobb is also a buck sergeant. As both Cobb and Ames are the best marksman in the regiment but constantly boast of their prowess, Colonel Barkley seeks to find an expert who can outshoot them. Though possessing a photographic memory that enabled him to advance from private to senior non- commissioned officer in less than 24 hours, Dodo has one weakness: though his book knowledge enables him to give lectures on weapons disassembly and ballistics, he is gun shy and an incompetent marksman. After nearly shooting several of his fellow soldiers on the pistol range, with the actual target being the safest place to hide, Dodo is ordered to go into the woods to practice. There his missed shots impress the picnicking colonel and his daughter Betty when Dodo accidentally shoots a hawk through the eye whilst in flight and after the colonel catches a fish who breaks the line and is in the process of rolling back into the water, an accidental discharge from Dodo's pistol shoots the fish through his eye. Eager to deflate the boasting Ames and Cobb, the colonel bets a month's pay that Dodo can outshoot Ames and Cobb. Ames and Cobb's hatred of Dodo increases when in the interests of promoting democracy in the United States Army, Betty invites Dodo to dinner at the colonel's quarters, but Ames and Cobb believe they have been invited as well.

It also promotes the application and communication of this knowledge, especially through education, to help protect human health and the environment. History The society, originally founded as the Environmental Mutagen Society (EMS) was formed in the USA in 1969 by Drs. Alexander Hollaender, Joshua Lederberg, James Crow, Ernst Freese, James Neel, William Russell, Heinrich Malling, Frederick J. de Serres, Matthew Meselson, and others. The initial aim was to support the study of environmental mutagenesis, originally in germ-cell mutagenesis, but the scope soon expanded to include all areas of mutagenesis, including mutational mechanisms, test methods, molecular epidemiology, biomarkers, and risk assessment. As a result of this change in scope, in 2012 the society's name was changed to better encompass the broadened reach of the organization. Activities and achievements In 1969, the EMS established the Environmental Mutagen Information Center (EMIC) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which developed the first bibliographic database on environmental mutagenesis, facilitating research throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, particularly the development of tests for genetic toxicology, through the establishment of a register of substances tested for toxicity. This, in turn, contributed significantly to the GENE-TOX program, established by Drs. Angela Auletta and Michael D. Waters at the US EPA and it now forms part of TOXNET. During the early 1970s, the society played a significant part in the development of the US Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, enabling the United States Environmental Protection Agency to include mutagenicity data in regulatory decisions. The EMS \\"Committee 17\\", chaired by John W. Drake, published an influential position paper; ‚ÄúEnvironmental Mutagenic Hazards‚Äù, in Science in 1975. This described the research needs and regulatory responsibility for managing potential mutagenic compounds in the environment. It influenced research direction, regulatory procedures and mutagenicity testing within industry. Publications In 1970 the EMS established the book series \\"Chemical Mutagens: Principles and Methods for Their Detection\\" and the first volume was published in the following year. This has included a number of influential papers, from the first by Dr. Bruce N. Ames on the Salmonella (Ames) mutagenicity assay. In 1979, the EMS began publishing its own journal, Environmental Mutagenesis, renamed Environmental and Molecular Mutagenesis in 1987. Meetings The society has met annually since its formation. The next annual meeting will be the 42nd and will be held in Montreal, Quebec, October 15‚Äì19, 2011. Awards and honors The EMS makes three major awards. Every year it awards the EMS Award in recognition of \\"outstanding research contributions in the area of environmental mutagenesis\\" and the Alexander Hollaender Award in recognition of \\"outstanding contributions in the application of the principles and techniques of environmental mutagenesis to the protection of human health\\". From time to time it also awards the EMS Service Award in recognition of \\"long-standing dedication and service to the Society\\". The EMS also makes a number of student and travel awards to promote and support the interests of the society. Collaboration and partnership The EMS is a member organisation of the International Association of Environmental Mutagen Societies (IAEMS) and the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.

History Based in Buenos Aires, Argentina, IAPTI was established on 30 September 2009, Saint Jerome's day. Created by a group of professional language mediators as a vehicle for promoting ethical practices in translation and interpretation and providing a forum for discussing problems typical of the globalized world, such as crowdsourcing, outsourcing, bad rates and other abuse. Technological-ethical issues are also important to IAPTI, such as the exploitation of language professionals as cheap proofreaders of machine-translated texts. It was founded by Aurora Humar√°n, an Argentinian sworn translator, Corresponding Member of the North American Academy of the Spanish Language, and marketing specialist. IAPTI applied for registration as a civil association in the City of Buenos Aires (Argentina). Its legal registration under the name \\"International Association of Professional Translators and Interpreters\\" took a long time to process with the Office of the Argentine Inspector-General for Justice. On 23 February 2017 it was announced that the Inspector-General for Justice has finally approved IAPTI as a civil association. According to its bylaws, the Association is directed and managed by a Board of Directors made up of the six following officers: President, Vice President, Secretary General, Treasurer, two Voting Members and two Alternate Voting Members. Events, webinars, publications IAPTI has held four international conferences, in London (2013), Athens (2014),IAPTI 2nd Conference at Eventful.com Bordeaux (2015), and the fourth conference was held in Buenos Aires in April 2017 at the Claridge Hotel, the same venue where the association was established eight years before.IAPTI 2017 at the Claridge Hotel The organization also offers free webinars and other courses to its members, as well as a digital newsletter The IAPTImes. Partnerships In 2013, IAPTI joined forces with AIIC, Red T and FIT in the Open Letter Project, which had been launched in 2012. Later they were also joined by Critical Link International, the International Council for the Development of Community Interpreting (CLI), and the World Association of Sign Language Interpreters (WASLI). They have sent open letters addressing several issues, among others: * put pressure on governments to ensure the long-term safety of linguists who served their troops in Afghanistan * ask the President of the United States for consideration with translators and interpreters in the wake of war against ISIS * advocate for the UN to pass a resolution declaring the 30 September as International Translation Day Honorary members Its honorary members are the following: *Noam Chomsky *Mona Baker *Valent√≠n Garc√≠a Yebra (in memoriam) *Sergio Viaggio *Fernando Navarro *Suzanne Jill Levine *Ricardo Chiesa *Lucille Barnes *Madeleine Lee *David Bellos Supports  Since 2009 language professionals from several countries have been active members of IAPTI, such as interpreter Tony Rosado or academic Mona Baker.

One of her friends,Michigan Daily April 22, 1939: Alumna is Head of Tientsin Hospital Madeleine Wayne Diehl, gave this personal tribute: \\"She bore the responsibility for human frailties in others. In her own determined and dedicated little body and dauntless spirit she was as strong as anyone I have known, and, in a way, solitary, as great souls often are...ever giving, and forgiving, ever blessing, ever blessed. Oh the dearness of her. Yes, I feel bereft, but I will try to incorporate, in the remaining time of my life, some of the steadfast faith and unswerving loyalty to her high code. Remarkable, oh yes, and also immeasurably lovable. I thank God she counted me as one of her friends.\\" Notes (1) As a consequence of the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, China had to pay reparations to eight countries. In 1908, the U.S. used its share for scholarships for Chinese students and for the construction of Tsinghua University in Beijing. The Tsinghua Special Scholarship was also a recipient. (2) Levi L. Barbour of Detroit, an alumnus and former regent of the University of Michigan, founded the Barbour Scholarship in 1917. While traveling in Asia, he recognized the need there for liberal and scientific education for women, particularly in medicine. He was inspired by the careers of three women physicians who were University alumnae, Drs. Ida Kahn and Mary Stone of China and Tomo Inouyi of Japan. His purposes were ultimately achieved, as evidenced by the remarkable careers of subsequent Barbour scholars, including Dr. Ting.

After compiling the reports, logs and maps of the expedition, Mulock returned to full-time service, seeing action on the beaches of Gallipoli and later as the most senior naval officer to be captured at Singapore in 1942.Hughes-Mullock 2006Polar Record 1964, p.230 (Obituaries)Bewley 1905, p.25-26 Early life George Francis Arthur Mulock was born in Fleetwood, Lancashire on 7 February 1882, the youngest child and only son of Railway Engineer George Phillips Mulock and Clara Frances Lugsdin. A fortnight after George's birth his mother died of complications from childbirth. His father never fully recovered from this personal tragedy and threw himself into his work as resident engineer on the construction of Fleetwood docks.Bewley 1905, p.25 The young child was taken in by his paternal aunt, Hester Jane, the wife of barrister-turned-journalist and future poet laureate Alfred Austin. At a young age George had determined that he should enter the Royal Navy and the Austins threw themselves into ensuring that this was achieved. In preparation George was despatched to Stanmore Park preparatory school. Austin was approached to assume the post of Poet Laureate, vacant since the death of Alfred, Lord Tennyson; he accepted and ensured that his nephew‚Äôs naval career would begin in earnest. Bewley 1905, p.24 Early naval career With a personal letter of recommendation from Prime Minister Lord Salisbury and with a subtle hint from the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Frederick Richards, a place was secured on board the old three-decker HMS Britannia, moored on the River Dart. On 15 January 1896, fourteen-year-old Midshipman George Mulock entered the Royal Navy, probably one of the last midshipman to have secured entry by the age-old practice of patronage. On 15 October 1897 Mulock was rated midshipman without examination and joined the newly completed battleship , on her way to join the China Station. This first introduction to eastern culture had a lasting effect upon the young midshipman. The ship made regular visits to Singapore, Shanghai, Wei Hai Wei, Nagasaki and Yokohama 'showing the flag' as one of the newest ships in the fleet. Returning to England, his postings reflected an aptitude for navigation and pilotage. Mulock had displayed a talent for positioning. In August 1900 he was appointed to the sailing brig HMS Pilot, tender to HMS Impregnable, 'Training ship for boys' at Devonport. Two months later he joined the battleship , flagship of Rear-Admiral Albert B. Jenkins, Second-in-Command of the Channel Squadron. Promoted to acting sub-lieutenant on 15 April 1901, he joined the naval college at Greenwich, named . His next appointment, in April 1902, was to , a paddle-driven surveying vessel attached to the Admiralty Hydrographic Service, where he was able to put to good use his recently acquired knowledge and natural aptitude for pilotage and surveying. At this point he was confirmed as a sub-lieutenant in the Royal Navy, back-dated to April 1901. Polar Explorer Mulock replaces Shackleton During his time on HMS Triton, newspapers were awash with news that a joint expedition by the Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) under the command of Commander Robert F. Scott, RN would travel to the Southern Continent and attempt to reach the Pole as well as conduct scientific research to ascertain the exact position of the south magnetic pole, allowing the Admiralty to produce conclusive magnetic charts of the region. Mulock's uncle and stepfather Alfred Austin, now Poet Laureate, wrote to Sir Clements Markham at the Royal Geographical Society remarking that his nephew had recently completed a course in HMS Triton and was now highly proficient in underwater survey, cartography, geometry and oceanography. For good measure a copy of the letter found its way to the office of Rear-Admiral Sir William Wharton, the Royal Navy Hydrographer. Markham, having returned from Norway where he had purchased for ¬£3,380 the ex-whaler Morgenen, now renamed Morning, was eager to despatch a relief ship to support Scott's expedition, which had sailed in August 1901. Markham had managed to raise ¬£22,000, enough capital to fit out the ship. The Admiralty's sole contribution was the loan of two officers, Lt. Edward Evans (who later became well known as Evans of the Broke) and a young sub-lieutenant, the nephew of the Poet Laureate, posted to the ship in late June 1902. Under the command of Captain William Colbeck, a veteran of the \\"Southern Cross\\" expedition and a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve, Morning would rendezvous with Discovery in Antarctica, replenish her supplies, and return with despatches. In January 1903 Morning made fast in ice at Hut Point in Antarctica, and on 3 February Mulock met Scott for the first time. Although Mulock was intended to replace any injured officer, his replacement of Ernest Shackleton in March 1903 caused later historians to suggest a great rift between Scott and Shackleton. The latter's scurvy and exhaustion were key factors, as well as Mulock's obvious talent for survey work. The young officer quickly set to work amassing data for the RGS. Mulock expressed a desire to explore the vast continent rather than spending his time behind a desk aboard Discovery. On 13 September, under the command of Lt. Michael Barne, Mulock, Quartley, Smythe, Crean and Joyce spent a week on the ice travelling to the South West depot to leave supplies. Mulock's next foray to the region almost ended in disaster as a severe weather front moved in close to their position. Joyce's feet were badly frostbitten, and Mulock and Barne alternated rubbing the young man's feet against the pit of their stomachs, saving them from likely amputation. After almost a year in the ice-bound and frozen wastes of Antarctica, Mulock informed Scott that he had observed the fracturing of ice around Discovery. As the crew assembled for the dedication of a cross to AB George Vince on 16 February 1904, cracking sounds were clearly heard echoing across the ice. With the senior officers dining, newly promoted Lieutenant Mulock was officer of the watch when violent surges indicated that Discovery was beginning to break free of the vice-like grip which had held her fast for over a year. As Discovery edged out from the ice and preparations were made for her voyage home, Mulock was permitted to conduct the first-ever running survey of the Drygalski Ice Tongue. He was awarded the Polar Medal for his work. Return home On Saturday 10 September 1904 Discovery docked at Portsmouth to much acclaim, and while the crew was feted by receptions and banquets celebrating the success of the British National Antarctic Expedition (BNAE), Mulock was informed that the Admiralty had seconded him to the Royal Geographical Society to compile, record logs, evaluate surveys and produce charts of Antarctica for use in the future. In 1908 his monumental work was published by the RGS. In recognition of his diligence and professional attitude towards his work Lieutenant Mulock was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and in 1908 awarded him the Back Award. Scott, Markham and Mulock met to discuss the final names accorded to various Antarctic features. This was to cause some disruption to Mulock's work with the RGS, but necessary before the newly promoted Scott dined with King Edward VII at Balmoral Castle. Scott suggested that a mysterious inlet be named after the expedition surveyor. This seemed minor recognition for the work of the talented Mulock, but Scott suspected that something far more exciting might be there. Subsequent expeditions travelled to the Mulock Inlet and discovered a vast glacier beyond the shoreline. The New Zealand National Antarctic Expedition later named this the Mulock Glacier in recognition of his contribution to Polar exploration. Return to the Royal Navy On 27 February 1906, at an RGS council dinner, Sir Clement Markham presented the Patron's Gold Medal to Scott, and silver medals to Discovery officers. The newly promoted Captain Scott CVO also informed Mulock that in recognition of his dedicated service and the interruption caused to his naval career, he had recommended him for the torpedo course at , a highly prized qualification in the pre-1914 navy. At Buckingham Palace on 18 December 1906 Lieutenant George Mulock R.N., F.R.G.S was presented to King Edward VII and invested with the Silver Polar Medal. On his return to the service in March 1907 Mulock joined the torpedo course at HMS Vernon. Shortly before Scott had invited Mulock to join him on a second polar expedition; the young lieutenant accepted without hesitation. Then Ernest Shackleton wrote to him inviting him to participate in the Nimrod Expedition. Due to the gentleman's agreement with Scott, Mulock declined but unintentionally sparked off a rivalry by revealing to Shackleton that Scott was planning to \\"go south again\\"; it came as no surprise that in April 1908 Mulock failed to qualify as a torpedo lieutenant.

Briggs, RN, commanding Vernon, recorded on Mulock's official service record that \\"his failure to qualify in torpedo was due to his inattention\\", a clear rebuke for the efforts of Scott and Shackleton. In 1908 Mulock was appointed to (Captain Henry Oliver, RN) in preparation for a command of his own. The following year, aged 26, Lieutenant George Mulock was piped aboard the destroyer as captain. A member of the trio of s, Hunter had been launched over a decade before in December 1895, but her Fairfield-built engines still provided and gave her a top speed of . Following a year's service with the Home Fleet, Mulock took command of the 320-ton shallow-draft river gunboat , serving with the China Station on the Yangtse and West rivers. The expansion of the Naval Intelligence Department at the Admiralty in 1909, created openings for promising officers; for the third time in his career Mulock was seconded out, this time to Naval Intelligence. In June 1911 he returned to command Woodlark. In quick succession in 1913, Mulock commanded the destroyers , and . First World War (1914‚Äì18) Gallipoli During the opening phase of the First World War Mulock safely conducted a convoy to the Far East, receiving a letter of commendation. As an acting Commander in 1915, Mulock was temporarily relieved of his command of HMS Jed when it was discovered that he had made little effort to conceal the confidential nature of the despatches entrusted to his care. In March 1915, whilst serving on the staff of Admiral John de Robeck, Mulock was stationed in the Dardanelles and witnessed first- hand the plight of the , which sank after hitting a mine. Using his initiative he quickly secured passage in Jed, and, with accompanying launches, rescued sailors from the water. For his prompt action he was mentioned in despatches. Transferred to the staff of the Principal Naval Transport Officer (PNTO) in August 1915, he was appointed Chief Assistant to Captain C.M. Staveley, RN and, as the London Gazette recorded, was \\"largely responsible for the evacuation of the great quantity of war materials and animals and for the distribution of forces from landing craft at Cape Helles and Suvla Bay\\". Both he and Captain Staveley are mentioned in the despatches of Vice-Admiral John de Robeck in \\"commendation of the successful carrying out of the naval programme and plans\\". de Robeck informed Mulock that he had been awarded the Distinguished Service Order (London Gazette 14.03.1916). With the returning battleship lacking a commander, Mulock returned as its executive officer. His promotion to Commander was confirmed in June 1916. His next appointment was as executive officer of the cruiser , overseeing her refit of battle damage received at the Battle of Jutland. The Mesopotamia campaign Naval intelligence expressed a desire for Commander Mulock to return to the China Station, but the Admiralty, displeased at interference in its command authority, dragged their feet in replying. In January 1917 Mulock was given command of the river gunboat HMS Sawfly, serving on the Tigris River in Mesopotamia. During this appointment he was informed that his half-brother Flight-Lieutenant Henry Collister Mulock of the Royal Flying Corps had been shot down and killed while flying over the Somme in France. Mulock was placed in temporary command of Fly-class gunboat HMS Firefly by the Senior Naval Officer in theatre on 4 March 1917.Royal Navy Officer's Service Record (National Archives, reference ADM196/46). (On 4 March 1917 he was notified that he had been appointed to command the sloop , but he never took command: while operating in the Atlantic as the Q-ship Q.12 she was torpedoed on 30 April 1917 by the German submarine , and sank under tow from the following day.) On 4 December 1917 he was appointed in command of the ,Royal Navy Officer's Service Record (National Archives, reference ADM196/46). transferred to the Tigris Flotilla from the Mediterranean. Bee, which had been serving upriver of Baghdad, returned to Basra on 26 December 1917.\\"26 December 1917\\" (https://www.naval-history.net/OWShips-WW1-11-HMS_Mantis.htm, accessed on 1 July 2020). Early in 1918 Bee was transferred to the China Station to reinforce the Yangtse Flotilla.See e.g. \\"8 February 1918\\" (https://www.naval- history.net/OWShips-WW1-11-HMS_Mantis.htm, accessed on 1 July 2020). Retirement With the prospect of a position with the Asiatic Petroleum division of Royal Dutch Shell as its Marine Superintendent in Shanghai, and an opportunity to continue to assist Naval Intelligence, Mulock agreed to ask to be placed on the retirement list. On 6 January 1920 Commander George Mulock, DSO, RN, FRGS relinquished command of Bee after two years. In a secondary role, the commander found himself working for the British Secret Service, relaying information on the Treaty Port at Shanghai, as well as Chinese troop movements and various warships visiting the port. Reporting to the Secret Service and the Commander-in-Chief, China Station, Mulock, although no longer a serving naval officer, was never far from the fleet. His association with the revered Scott of the Antarctic made him something of a talking point in Shanghai society, and he was never short of a dinner invitation. Mulock was informed in 1927 that he was to be advanced to the rank of captain on the retired list. Settled into the rather mundane life in a Chinese Treaty Port, Mulock was soon aware of the increased military traffic generated by forces of the Empire of Japan. Throughout the 1930s Captain Mulock relayed information to London, reporting on troop movements, ships, diplomatic couriers, and related developments. When the Japanese attacked the Shanghai for a second time in 1937, doctors aboard a Royal Navy ship informed Mulock that he must return home because of a duodenal ulcer, adding that he would also benefit from a few days of medical observation. The decision had very little to do with his medical condition, it was a ruse to provide Mulock with an excuse to leave China and return to the UK carrying important information for the Foreign Office and the Admiralty, and papers from the British representatives. The growing unease with which the British in the various treaty ports were viewing the activities of the Empire of Japan was becoming a matter of concern. With the increasing threat of war with Germany looming, key military and naval personnel in the Far East were quickly recognising the danger of having to potentially fight a war on a second front. Second World War (1939‚Äì45) Singapore 1939‚Äì41 Promoted to captain while he was on the retired list in 1927, Mulock was recalled by the Admiralty in the summer of 1939. He left the UK in late August 1939 aboard the British-India Steam Navigation Company liner HMT Dunera, chartered as a troopship to transport personnel to the Far East. While traversing the Suez Canal the passengers heard that war had been declared. Upon arrival in Singapore, Mulock joined the Pool of Officers at the Singapore Naval Base in Sembawang, Singapore. At this time the principal concern was the operations of German raiders in the Pacific Ocean and China Sea. These ships had created havoc in the last war, and this would be the primary focus of naval forces in the region until the entry of Japan into the war in December 1941. The administrative base for Singapore was under the overall command of Rear Admiral Drew RN as Rear Admiral Malaya (RAMY), a sub-command of the soon-to-be-discontinued Commander-in-Chief, China Station. During the early months of the war Singapore was under the overall command of Admiral Sir Percy Noble RN, who was superseded by Vice-Admiral Sir Geoffrey Layton in September 1940. Extended Defences (XDO, Fort Canning) In late September 1939 Captain Mulock was appointed Extended Defences Officer (XDO) for Fort Canning and Head of Extended Defences, Singapore. The official designation of this post was as supervisory office for the extensive minefields surrounding Singapore Island. In addition, XDO was to maintain the minefields, co-ordinate visual reports between the various Post War Signal Stations (PWSS), dotted around the Singapore coastline. XDO would then further co-ordinate between the coastal batteries, the 15\\" gun emplacements through Commander, Fixed Defences. The Office of the XDO was further augmented by a secondary, more secretive role, as yet fully undetermined. The XDO office was run from a number of places in Singapore including Fort Canning, the Singapore Naval Base, (the old sloop moored at Telok Ayer) and deep beneath Fort Canning in the infamous The Battle Box underground complex. The XDO Division operated a 24-hour continuous watch system headed by Captain Mulock with the assistance of his naval secretary. Each watch was supervised by a Lieutenant RNVR and a number of ratings specialising in coding, cyphers and communications. At the time of the outbreak of war in the Far East the XDO Division was still not fully manned and it was not until the sinking of that the staff was augmented by survivors from the doomed ship. When Force Z was sunk off Malaya in December 1941, Captain Mulock and his secretary, Lieutenant D.J. Copley RNR, were with Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham at Fort Canning. The news was shocking and Lieutenant Copley would later recall that Brooke-Popham just buried his head in his hands. With the loss of Force Z and the invasion of Malaya underway Captain Mulock was asked to take over the vacant position of Captain AV (Captain, Auxiliary Vessels), maintaining and running a small fleet of vessels pressed into service. Many of the ships were old tramp steamers, coasters and the like, hastily retrofitted for wartime service. It is an established fact that the great and much-vaunted Singapore Naval Base had one glaring weakness, no ships! These small craft were soon carrying out sweeps up the east and western coasts of Malaya and the Johore Straits around Singapore Island. From his office at the Singapore Naval Base and through his contacts with Naval Intelligence it was abundantly clear to Captain Mulock that the colony would soon fall. Rear-Admiral E J Spooner DSO, RN quickly re-focused his attentions to the evacuation of key personnel from the colony and the destruction of all facilities which could conceivably be utilised by the Japanese. Captain Mulock and his staff at Extended Defences, under the indirect command of Rear-Admiral Spooner, co-ordinated the systematic evacuation of some sixteen vessels which sailed from Singapore at dawn on 12 February, or ‚ÄòBlack Friday‚Äô as it would later be known. At 9am on the 12th Mulock and other key military figures attended a conference at Fort Canning chaired by the Admiral. During the conference it was decided that key military personnel would be evacuated, and passes were divided between the various department heads, to be distributed amongst younger technical personnel, but not themselves. If the allotted figure could not be reached any remaining passes were to be given to women and children. RAF equipment crowded aboard in the evacuation of Singapore, 12 February 1942 The exact size of the so- called \\"Empire Star Convoy\\" is unknown and numbers range from six to over thirty, but included the , , and . The light cruiser , the destroyer and two converted civilian vessels, the minesweeper HMS Scott Harley and anti- submarine vessel HMS Kedah, would escort the convoy. It is estimated that only two or three of the dozens of ships to leave Singapore during 11‚Äì13 February 1942 actually made it to safety. Three ships that Captain Mulock personally oversaw the evacuation of were the Blue Star Line refrigerated cargo ship Empire Star (which left on 12 February), (left on the night of 12 February), and (left on the morning of 13 February). Empire Star was one of two from the first flotilla not to be sunk by the Japanese. Many of the officers and ratings from Mulock's department, Extended Defences, were evacuated in the convoy. Rear-Admiral Spooner had decided on 12 February that, before his own evacuation the following day, any seaworthy ship left in Keppel Harbour should sail for Java that night. With an estimated capacity of 3,000 evacuees, this would probably be the last opportunity to evacuate the military and civilian population. The criterion for obtaining passage depended on status level if a civilian or if military level of technical specialisation essential to continuing the war effort. Having witnessed first-hand the brutality displayed by the Japanese in Shanghai during the 1930s, Captain Mulock was determined to evacuate as many civilians and officials as was possible. He was frustrated to see ships leaving the port half full in the weeks leading up to the surrender and then grossly overloaded, as the situation became more volatile. Not only did he assume responsibility for evacuating civilians without documentation, but he also arranged the evacuation of key military, intelligence and diplomatic personnel from the colony, including the few remaining members of his own staff. He personally organised the evacuation of Rear-Admiral E J Spooner aboard the motor launch ML 310. Spooner and Air Vice Marshal C.W.H. Pulford (Air Officer Commanding, Singapore) were seen off by General Percival. Pulford said to Percival upon his departure \\"I suppose you and I will be held responsible for this but God knows we did our best with what little we had been given\\". The Flight of the Mary Rose (14‚Äì17 February 1942) Resigned to his fate as one of the very few remaining naval officers in Singapore, at 2200 hrs on the evening of 14 February, Captain Mulock was ordered to report to the office of Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival (G.O.C., Singapore) at Fort Canning, where he was informed that personnel, hand-picked selected by the governor-general and by Percival himself, were awaiting evacuation. The Captain was ordered to requisition the motor launches Osprey and Mary Rose, and convey key Australian diplomatic, Malayan Civil Service and Special Branch personnel to safety. The Osprey was designed to seat ten persons, but when the party arrived it numbered nearly forty. At the party‚Äôs head Australian Official Representative Vivian Gordon Bowden CBE, and his staff. Bowden had refused all requests to leave, but on Percival‚Äôs urging he finally decided to leave. The group was confronted on the quayside by a mob of Australian deserters armed with Thompson submachine guns and hand grenades. The party, led by Captain Mulock, was able to make its way onto the Osprey, but the deserters opened fire and machine-gunned the launch. There were no casualties, and after a foiled attempt by the deserters to board the launch, some 38 people were ferried out to the Mary Rose at 2330 hrs on 14 February 1942. The Mary Rose, a motor launch, was one of the last vessels to leave the colony. Captain Mulock took with him six Malay seamen from . Amongst the launch‚Äôs 38 passengers were Mr Vivian Gordon Bowden (Australian Official Representative in Singapore), Mr Alfred Wootton (Commercial Secretary) Mr John Quinn (Political Secretary), Lt. Colonel John Dalley of Dalforce and five of his officers, Lt Colonel H.L. Hill OBE (4/19th Hyderabad, Indian Army), Major K.S. Morgan (Head of Singapore Special Branch), Captain Charles Corry (Malayan Civil Service), Chief Superintendent M. L. Wynne (Assistant Chief of Police, Singapore) Head of Special Branch. Prisoner of War (1942‚Äì45) On the evening of 16 February 1942 Mary Rose, en route for Bangka, was illuminated by searchlights from two Japanese patrol vessels in the Muntok Strait beyond the Moesi River, who threatened to open fire on the launch. Captain Mulock refused to surrender, but a close warning shot across the bows forced him to reconsider. In the absence of a white flag, a pair of underpants was found amongst a passenger‚Äôs luggage and hoisted. An English-speaking Japanese officer came aboard and Captain Mulock offered his sword to the officer, thus became the last Royal Navy captain to surrender his sword to the enemy. The vessel was escorted to Muntok harbour on Bangka Island where the Mary Roses occupants were taken ashore as prisoners of war. Captain Mulock and his Malay sailors remained aboard until the Imperial Japanese Navy came for them. The prisoners were held in a cinema-hall at Muntok where Commissioner V G Bowden told his captors in their own language of his diplomatic status and remonstrated with guards who attempted to remove his personal possessions. Soldiers punched him and dragged him outside, and he was later executed. There remains some confusion as to what happened over the course of the next few days but Captain Mulock was next seen under escort at Muntok, with the officer to whom he surrendered his sword being taken to a waiting craft. Behind him his luggage was being carried by Japanese ratings! There is evidence to suggest he returned to Singapore in the , known to be in the region at the time. On 19 February 1942 the Imperial Japanese Navy returned Captain Mulock to Singapore as the most senior surviving staff officer and he was forced to witness the handover of the Singapore Naval Base to the IJN. Imprisoned in Changi Prison, he joined the Senior Officers party, which included General Percival, army officers above the rank of colonel and Naval officers above the rank of Commander, who were shipped to Taiwan. As a POW, Captain Mulock was held at Karenko and Shirakawa where he shared a cell with Sir Mark Aitchison Young, the Governor of Hong Kong, before being relocated briefly to Japan aboard the infamous hell-ship, the Oryoku Maru. Later he and others were sent to Manchuria, to a camp near the town of Mukden, where they were liberated by Soviet troops in August 1945. He was so frail by this time that he was airlifted to Calcutta for medical treatment. Later life Once he had recuperated from his time as a POW, Captain Mulock returned to Singapore on the staff of the newly-created Flag Officer, Malaya. His primary duties were compiling information on the casualties, missing, killed and unknown deaths from Singapore and Malaya. These included discovering the fate of Admiral Spooner. These records were subsequently handed over to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Captain Mulock also gave evidence at the post-war War Crimes Trials in Hong Kong. He retired in late 1946 to South Africa where he bought land and took up bee-keeping. He later moved to Malaga in Spain, where he spent the rest of his life. He died in hospital in Gibraltar on 26 December 1963 aged 81. George Mulock in popular culture In March 2012, at the premiere of the screenplay of Reynold's Cargo, a wartime drama, based on the civilian evacuations from Singapore, the character of a naval captain called Mulock was portrayed by Glenn Hazeldine. The drama written by Sydney-based writer Carolyn Anderson is a fictional account, though heavily influenced by historical fact. The protagonist, William Reynolds, a disgraced former naval officer, leads a boat full of civilians to safety while the Japanese pursue.

The expedition was part of the war of the Boxer Rebellion.  Background  The Boxers were an anti-Christian, anti-foreign rural mass movement. Their objective was to rid China of foreign (Western) influence. In May and early June 1900, they advanced on Beijing. The Qing government of China was equivocal about the Boxers, fearing that they might become anti-Qing. The Boxers were a serious threat to Western and Japanese citizens and Chinese Christians living in Beijing, Tianjin, and other areas of northern China. The diplomatic Legations (Embassies) in Beijing requested that marines be sent to protect them; more than 400 from eight countries arrived in Beijing on 31 May. However, as the threat from the Boxers increased, it became apparent that additional soldiers were needed. On 9 June, Sir Claude Maxwell MacDonald the British Minister cabled Vice Admiral Edward Hobart Seymour, commander of the British Navy's China fleet, that the situation in Beijing \\"was hourly becoming more serious\\" and that \\"troops should be landed and all arrangements made for an advance to Peking [Beijing] at once.\\"Fleming, Peter. The Siege of Peking. New York: Harper, 1959, p. 72 On receipt of MacDonald's message, Seymour assembled within 24 hours a force of more than 2,000 sailors and marines from Western and Japanese warships and prepared to embark for Beijing from Tianjin, 75 miles away, by train.. His force consisted of 916 British, 455 Germans, 326 Russians, 158 French, 112 Americans, 54 Japanese, 41 Italians, and 26 Austrians.Davids, Jules, ed. American Diplomatic and State Papers: The United States and China: Boxer Uprising, Series 3, Vol. 5. Wilmington, DE: Scholarly Resources, 1981, p. 102. Other accounts give slightly different numbers. Seymour's Chief of Staff was Captain John Jellicoe. The Commander of the Americans in the expedition was Captain Bowman H. McCalla. The diplomats in Beijing anticipated that Seymour would arrive there on 11 June, but he didn't. Shortly thereafter, all communications were cut and the Seymour Expedition disappeared in the interior of China. Acting without the Chinese Imperial court's permission, they had, in effect, launched an invasion. The Chinese response was decisive; the Seymour Expedition suffered a disastrous defeat.  The expedition  Allied troops suffered from severe illnesses, unsanitary conditions, diarrhea, flies, and other pests. General Dorwood cautioned advance, urging 60,000 men to be ready before going forward since he witnessed the Chinese pound the Allied forces with their weaponry at Tianjin. The Chinese destroyed the railroads and junk ships to prevent the Allied advance. German Field Marshal Alfred von Waldersee was selected as supreme commander, but he was in Germany with his soldiers. Lieutenant-General Sir Alfred Gaselee was chosen as temporary commander of the expedition because the Alliance was prejudiced against the non-white Japanese General Yamaguchi Motomi even though he was the highest-ranking officer. Only 2,500 soldiers and marines were on hand to maintain a position some ten miles in length, with all communication with the fleet cut off for a considerable time. But the troops of the Powers were being rushed to the scene with the utmost dispatch possible. Not, however, until 14 July had enough reinforcements arrived from the coast to relieve after severe fighting the beleaguered force and to capture the entire city, which was indispensable as a base of operations against Peking. Then came another distressing wait before the advance on the capital could begin. This was largely on account of the changed opinions regarding Chinese valor and the effectiveness of their resistance to the Seymour expedition. As it was, the Allies would have tarried at Tientsin for additional reinforcements some weeks longer had not the British and American commanders threatened to proceed alone with their contingents and risk the consequences. Although it was felt, so had the estimation of Chinese prowess been increased, that at least 50,000 troops were necessary, some thought 70,000, successfully to invade the interior, the second relief expedition to Peking finally got under way, on 4 August, The main force was composed of Japanese (20,840), Russian (13,150), British (12,020), French (3,520), American (3,420), German (900), Italian (80), Austro-Hungarian (75). Deliberate and Accidental Allied Friendly Fire The Allies argued and fought each other, severely criticizing each other's fighting ability. Some British Royal Welsh Fusiliers killed four Germans in a fight. Their commander allegedly imprisoned his men for not murdering more Germans. The French often fired (possibly) by accident on the other Allied forces, doing not much of anything else. Weather temperatures and insects plagued the Allies. Soldiers dehydrated, and horses died. Chinese villagers killed Allied troops who searched for wells, and gouged out the eyes and sliced the tongues off Japanese troops, nailing them to village doors. The weather resulted in many Allied soldiers dying of heat as they foamed at the mouth during the expedition. The British Indians and even the Russians, who were judged to be the strongest, succumbed. . Atrocities The tactics were gruesome on either side. By this time, each side had heard reports of the atrocities committed by the other. Foreign newspapers printed rumors and third hand reports; some turned out true.Jane E.

(Hong Kong: The Chinese University Press, 2002; ), pp. 1‚Äì41. Witnesses reported that the Allies beheaded already dead Chinese corpses, bayoneted or beheaded live Chinese, and raped Chinese girls and women. . The Russians and Japanese were both especially noted for their atrocities by the other allies. Russians killed Chinese civilians indiscriminately.. There were widespread reports that Chinese responded with violence and mutilation, especially toward captured Russians,[https://books.google.com/books?id=5K9BN96p1hcC&pg;=PA168#v=onepage&q;&f;=false .

The area is bounded by Harper Avenue and Interstate 94 on the north, Mack Avenue to the south, East Outer Drive and Whittier on the east and Alter Road and East Outer Drive to the west. The local association that shares the name MorningSide with the community is a collaboration of residents working together to take care of this area. Michigan Radio has made Morningside the subject of in depth coverage.http://www.michiganradio.org/term/morningside-48224http://www.michiganradio.org/post/morningside- detroit-neighborhood History MorningSide began as a French settlement of ribbon farms late in the 1700s. Since the only reliable method of travel was by boat or canoe, access to Lake Saint Clair and the Detroit River was a necessity. French settlers established ‚Äúribbon farms‚Äù which were long narrow strips of land that stretched inland for miles. These narrow farms each provided access to waterways for drinking water, fishing and transportation; and to the land for timber, farming and game. Some of the ribbon farms that would later become part of MorningSide were owned by Alec Trombly, P. Trombly, Robert Trombly, Mrs. L. Brown, Mrs. Turner and G. Martin.H. Belden & Co., Illustrated historical atlas of the county of Wayne,MI, Chicago: Belden, 1876. These ribbon farms were collectively part of Grosse Pointe Township, until the end of the 19th century, when Detroit annexed ‚Äúlarge portions of the township of Grosse Pointe.‚Äù Detroit's population had grown in response to auto manufacturing. Jobs were plentiful and working wages supported middle-class mobility. Ribbon farms, which had been farmed for decades, now were redeveloped into sub-divisions for housing. The MorningSide neighborhood blossomed in response to Detroit's middle-class housing needs into a collection of real estate sub-divisions. Brick homes characteristic of the MorningSide neighborhood. Alter Road stretches through the MorningSide community and Detroit's east side and runs roughly four miles in length. In recent history, The Detroit Grosse Pointe Collaborative has been working to revitalize the east side of Detroit which leads to Grosse Pointe Park. The plan has revolved around promoting real estate development, beautification efforts, community organizing and long-term maintenance. In 2014 the governments of Grosse Pointe Park and Detroit reached an agreement to establish a gateway between the two communities and to remove a marketplace along Alter Road that was viewed as separating the two communities.http://media.mlive.com/news/detroit_impact/other/Kercheval- Agreement.pdfhttp://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2014/08/detroit_and_grosse_pointe_park.html Architecture The Alger Theater is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Initially constructed in 1935, the Art Moderne style Alger Theater is one of two unchanged neighborhood movie theaters left in Detroit. The historic theater sits on the northwest corner of East Warren Avenue and Outer Drive. It stands as a representation of Detroit's historic past, retaining much of its historic building materials and served its purpose of film watching for fifty years. It opened its doors on August 22, 1935 to roughly 1200 excited Detroiters who lined up eagerly for a viewing of ‚ÄúThe Girl from Tenth Avenue‚Äù starring Bette Davis. Originally opened by George W. Trendle, who later purchased radio station WXYZ, the theater was named after Michigan Governor Russell A. Alger, who served in the American Civil War and held the post of Secretary of War under PresidentWilliam McKinley in 1897. In 1983, a non-profit group, the Friends of Alger Theater, formed to save the theater from being demolished and holds music events and fundraisers to renovate the theater. Government The Jefferson Branch of the Detroit Public Library was opened at its current location on East Outer Drive on October 4, 1951, the first National Library Day. It is named for the author of the Declaration of Independence and the third President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson. In addition to the lending of its 53,000 book titles, the library provides an array of other services for all ages including the lending of magazines, videos, audio cassettes, and the provision of Internet access. Services also include income tax forms January through April, student financial aid forms, computers for public use, core collection of Career & Employment Information Center materials and a copy machine. Residents of MorningSide reside in the Eastern District of police service provided by the Detroit Police Department. The department is currently led by Police Chief Ralph L. Godbee and the Eastern District is led by Commanders James Moore and Robert Ennis. The district is made up of the former fifth and ninth precincts, which have been consolidated. The community of MorningSide has a lieutenant designated to tend to their needs specifically. The city of Detroit has four neighborhood resource centers that connect the neighborhoods and their institutions to the city government known as Community Access Centers (CAC, formerly Neighborhood City Halls). A few of the duties of these centers are to assist community associations and block clubs in planning events, recruiting volunteers for the annual Motor City Makeover and Angels' Night events and providing bus and tax help. The MorningSide community is served by the East District which is managed by Ray Solomon II. Institutions John E. Clark Preparatory Academy The MorningSide Community is home to John E. Clark Preparatory Academy. It has been a neighborhood elementary school for nearly 100 years. The school is part of the Detroit Public School system and teaches grade levels beginning at kindergarten and up to fifth grade. The community and MorningSide have made the school a focal point in cleanup efforts and stabilization. The elementary school received a grant from the Lowes Harper Woods store valued at 100,000 dollars which will pay for a new kitchen and sewing room. The school took on new initiatives in 2010, including enforcement of school uniforms for all the children and changing their name from Clark Elementary to J.E. Clark Preparatory Academy. Part of their mission is to enable their students to become productive citizens that can meet the needs of a global society. Historically, the school was named after John Clark, a physician and chemist who served on the Board of Education. The school was built on an area of land that was once called the ‚ÄúOld Rifle Range‚Äù on the city's east side. The school sits on Bremen Street between Balfour Road and Buckingham Road. The Ronald Brown Academy is a Pre K-6th grade elementary school located on East Outer Drive in MorningSide. The school was named after the first African American Secretary of Commerce. Students who attend the Ronald Brown Academy are offered enrichment and learning experiences such as the science club, sports, modern and ballroom dancing, French Club, the science fair, art, band, chess, glee club and the gospel choir. The Academy is a Skillman High Performing School and won one of the six National School Change Awards from the Panasonic Corporation in 2008, which included $5000 and a chance for students to be participants in a national research project focusing on school change. Peace Lutheran Church Peace Lutheran Church is a multi-cultural congregation in the MorningSide Neighborhood located at 15700 East Warren. They believe that to have a better city, we need to have a better neighborhood. To that end, Peace not only offers worship and Bible study opportunities but ‚Äúwe believe in caring for those in our midst by offering a variety of personal services.‚Äù Peace Lutheran Church is a Faith in Action Partner with Habitat for Humanity within the MorningSide community. They also host the MorningSide community group's meetings the second Tuesday of every month. Metro Central Church of Christ, located at 4455 Barham, has been a part of the community since 1999. They hold Bible studies, visit sick and shut in members and host a youth group. The congregation also has a very active music group, Voices of Metro. Bethany Lutheran Church and School were founded in 1889. They moved to their current location in on East Outer Drive in MorningSide in 1942. The school is no longer in operation, but the church remains open for worship. St. Matthew Parish is a Catholic church located at Whittier and Harper. They hold services five days per week excluding Tuesday and Thursday. The church was founded in 1927. The Christ United Methodist Church is also located within the community on East Warren. Recreational space The MorningSide Gateway Park being built by volunteers. MorningSide has three parks within its borders. MorningSide Gateway Park is a green space park that was donated to the community by DTE and is located on the corner of Mack Ave and Alter Rd. U-SNAP-BAC also has a park in the community called MorningSide Commons Park, located on Wayburn, which serves as a play area for children. The third park is Munich Three Mile Park which is more of a family space, it's space uses approximately three parcels on each of the four corners of Three Mile Drive and Munich Road. It has a gazebo style picnic area on the Northwest corner, a children's playground on the Southwest side and picnic tables on the Northeast corner as well. Community organizations MorningSide, established in 1977, is a non-profit community organization where the elected board works with community members to make MorningSide a better place. Through the mechanisms of block clubs and monthly meetings they keep residents informed and connected. They promote community involvement in dealing with issues such as clean-up efforts, energy saving and keeping the community safe. In the past they have participated in the MorningSide parade down East Warren and hosted a youth basketball league. In 2009 MorningSide was one of nine community-based organizations selected from a pool of over forty applicants to receive a Community and Property Preservation (CAPP) program, which is funded by The Kresge Foundation. They used the $4950 to fund four projects: Lawn Maintenance, Mural Painting, Residential Board-Up and Trash Removal. The association's president, Kelley Marks, was featured in the Model D Media report \\"37 Minutes in MorningSide with Kelley Marks\\". In October 2010, MorningSide was awarded the Moe (Most Outstanding Neighborhood on the Eastside) Better Neighborhood Group award from the Warren/Conner Development Coalition. United Streets Networking and Planning: Building a Community (U-SNAP-BAC) is a consortium of two corporations that was formed in 1987 by a conglomeration of other community groups. The organization operates education programs for first-time purchasers of residential property, oversees funding for house repairs, works with the community board and Habitat for Humanity to construct new houses, and sponsors a community garden. Newly constructed homes in MorningSide. Habitat for Humanity's activity in Morningside began in 2006, offering financial literacy initiatives and workshops as well as residential construction. The organization's volunteers in the neighborhood perform more than construction; weatherization, rehabilitation of vacant or foreclosed houses, and other maintenance services are also offered. Community businesses operate the CEM Business Association, which also serves the areas of Cornerstone Village and East English Village. The association concentrates on maintenance of the East Warren business district and surrounding blocks, using efforts ranging from the provision of business loans to the hiring of a street-sweeping team. Community partnerships In 2009, members of the MorningSide Community along with high school and middle school students volunteered their time to create murals to cover the doors and windows of vacant homes in the community of MorningSide. This was part of an effort to preserve and maintain the community, which included mowing lawns and cleaning up areas around abandoned homes. The Mural Project was successful in improving the appearance of over a dozen homes in the area and was featured on Detroit's radio station WJR. The project was a way to encourage involvement in preserving a community which has been physically affected by foreclosures and was funded by a grant from the Collin Hubbel Fund. MorningSide Mural Project In 2010, the MorningSide Community has been the main focus of the Detroit Sun Project, which is run by graduate students from the University of Michigan's School of Natural Resources and Environment and Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning. Their main goal and focus has revolved around economic, environmental and social sustainability as the project seeks new ways to further prevent urban decline. Citizen participation has been promoted by the project as they are open to hearing new ideas from members living in the community who have first-hand experience dealing with urban decay. The Detroit Sun Project's primary initiatives have included things such as blight removal, environmental and public health, and water efficiency and management. These types of initiatives are meant to directly benefit residents of the MorningSide Community through economic savings and a cleaner living environment. In early November 2009, the Detroit Sun Project and Wayne County Department of Environment C.L.E.A.N. Program teamed up for clean-up effort in an area of MorningSide that has been hit hard by abandonment, foreclosures and illegal garbage dumping. The effort exemplified the commitments made by both the Detroit Sun Project, members of MorningSide and community residents to improving their neighborhood. MorningSide also has a partnership with the University of Michigan-Dearborn's Urban and Regional Studies Program. In the 2010 fall semester the program's senior capstone research class worked with MorningSide on an action research project. Action research provides a vehicle for community members and volunteers to address issues that arise as a part of their work, allowing for the productivity of their organization or program to increase. The vehicle is a \\"systematic approach\\" that searches for a resolutions that are tailored to the local issues, rather than generalized to fit a broad perspectiveStringer, Ernest T. Action Research: Third Edition (Thousand Oaks,CA: Sage Publications, Inc., 2007), 1. Part of the project has manifested itself as this page. An analysis of the organizational structure based on Fisher's (1994) three dominant historical approaches to neighborhood organizing has demonstrated that MorningSide is a community organization which functions primarily as a neighborhood maintenance group that also draws attention from public officials.Fisher, Robert. Let the People Decide: Neighborhood Organizing in America, Updated Edition (New York: Twayne Publishers,1994.) MorningSide residents have also benefited from services provided in their community by the Detroit Office of Foreclosure Prevention and Response (FPR). Although the program does not directly provide mortgage services to residents, they provide informational resources to new and existing homeowners who are dealing with issues such as foreclosures and taxes. They do this by sharing tools, resources and recommendations to partners and organizations such as MorningSide in the city of Detroit to reduce foreclosures in the area. Resources such as educational classes are also provided by the organizations for residents looking to purchase their first home and also for residents who are seeking to refinance and save their existing home. The organization also directs residents in need of legal services and prevention counseling when dealing with their homes. MorningSide and U-Snap-Bac have hosted events to educate community members on their legal options.

The seat was vacated by former National Ethnic Affairs Minister Pansy Wong, who announced her resignation from the New Zealand Parliament on 14 December 2010 following allegations her husband Sammy had misused taxpayer money in relation to overseas travel. The seat was won by Jami-Lee Ross, retaining the seat for the New Zealand National Party but with a 27% reduction in majority. Demographics and election history The Botany electorate was created shortly before the 2008 election and is considered a safe National seat. A third of the population is born overseas and it has a large Chinese population. Wong won the seat with 17382 (56.22%) votes in the 2008 general election. Labour candidate Koro Tawa was runner-up with 6510 (21.06%) and ACT's Kenneth Wang on 4717 (15.26%). Party votes were National 19355 (61.25%), Labour 7958 (25.18%) and Act 1528 (4.84%). Candidates Nominations opened on 2 February and closed at noon on 8 February. National Party The National Party selected Jami-Lee Ross, a member of the Auckland Council representing Howick, as their candidate. He was selected from a shortlist of five candidates, the other four being former Auckland City councillor Aaron Bhatnagar, media presenter Maggie Barry, Elim Christian College teacher Darron Gedge, and health research scientist Edward Saafi. A total of twelve people had initially put their names forward for the nomination. The list was not released, but was reported to include Denise Krum (a National Party official and former president of United Future), Ram Rai (a National Party official), Ken Yee (a former Manukau City councillor and unsuccessful candidate for Manukau East), Youngshin Watkins, and Daniel Newman. Other names that had been speculated included current list MP Melissa Lee (who had unsuccessfully contested the Mount Albert by-election earlier in the parliamentary term), party official Kit Parkinson, and Howick Local Board chairman Michael Williams. ACT ACT selected MIT lecturer and Counties Manukau DHB member Lyn Murphy. Labour Party The Labour Party selected Michael Wood, Puketapapa Local Board member, as their candidate. The other two people that contested the nomination were Roy Bootle and David Collings. Collings withdrew before the selection process was completed. Koro Tawa, who contested the seat in the previous general election had already been selected to contest it in the next one, was originally reported to be seeking the nomination for the by- election as well, but did not in the end. Others The Green Party selected Richard Leckinger, a former ministerial advisor and researcher at Parliament. However, he was stuck in traffic and could not submit the nomination form in time. The Pirate Party selected Hussain Al-Saady, a recent university graduate. The recently founded New Citizen Party selected businessman Paul Young. Independents included veteran campaigner Penny Bright, translator and former candidate for Puketapapa Local Board Robert Goh, and former candidate for mayor Wayne Young. Campaign Wood started the campaign by admitting to the local paper in Puketapapa he had no chance of winning. A week later, he told the local paper in Botany he hadn't given up yet. NZPA reported that the new New Citizen Party had put up more billboards than him. Wood claimed Ross was \\"too scared\\" to have a TV debate with him on the \\"big issues\\", while making a pledge \\"to drive penis lollies out of the community\\". Meanwhile, National warned against being complacent and taking the election for granted. Paul Young wanted 10% GST, \\"traditional values in the education system\\" and \\"respect for elders\\". Bright again campaigned on her theme of open, transparent and democratically accountable governments. She condemned the planned partial privatisation of state assets, saying \\"partial privatisation is like partial pregnancy ‚Äì there is no such thing\\". Wayne Young, made homeless by the leaky homes crisis, wanted building standards to be strengthened. The Pirate Party left its campaign to the last minute, handing out fliers at 6pm on the day before the election. Results Official results as declared on Wednesday 16 March 2011 after special votes were counted. Ross resigned his seat on the Auckland Council on the Monday after the election. Alleged illegal campaigning New Zealand law prohibits campaigning on election day. It is alleged that the United Chinese Press newspaper published a front-page article on election day endorsing Paul Young. It is further alleged the paper ran an ad in the same edition for the New Citizen Party. The editor of the United Chinese Press insists the newspaper in question was printed on the day before, and therefore legal.

Red blood cells, while flexible, may in some circumstances succumb to physical shear and compression.Dan L. Longo, Harrison's Hematology and Oncology, 2010, ; page 121. This may result in hemoglobinuria. The damage is induced through repetitive mechanical motions such as prolonged marching (march hemoglobinuria) and marathon running.Reinhold Munker, Erhard Hiller, Jonathan Glass, Ronald Paquette, Modern Hematology: Biology and Clinical Management, 2007, page 126, .Anthony S. Fauci, Eugene Braunwald, Dennis Kasper, Stephen Hauser, Dan L. Longo, Harrison's Manual of Medicine, page 328, 2009, . Mechanical damage can also be induced through the chronic condition microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or due to prosthetic heart valves. Cause Repetitive impacts to the body may cause mechanical trauma and bursting (hemolysis) of red blood cells. This has been documented to have occurred in the feet during running and hands from Conga or Candombe drumming. Defects in red blood cell membrane proteins have been identified in some of these patients. Free haemoglobin is released from lysed red blood cells and filtered into the urine. Hemolytic phenomena March haemoglobinuria March hemoglobinuria, occurs when hemoglobin is seen in the urine after repetitive impacts on the body, particularly affecting the feet. The word \\"march\\" is in reference to the condition arising in soldiers who have been marching for long periods; the condition was first documented in 1881. Runner‚Äôs macrocytosis Runner's macrocytosis is a phenomenon of increased red blood cell size as a compensatory mechanism for increased red blood cell turnover. The impact forces from running can lead to red blood cell hemolysis and accelerate red blood cell production. This can shift the ratio of red blood cells towards younger, larger cells. This shift may be reflected in higher than normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) values, an indicator of red blood cell size. This is not a pathological condition but may indicate a propensity toward iron deficiency anemia due to high red blood cell turnover.

A public vote was taken to determine if the school should be built halfway between Whitewater and Potwin, near Brainerd, which passed 745 \\"yes\\" to 155 \\"no\\". A contest was held to find a unique name for the new high school, which was chosen to honor the famous American Old West artist Frederic Remington who lived about 4 miles north in the 1880s.

African music instrument made from a food can Repurposing is the process by which an object with one use value is transformed or redeployed as an object with an alternative use value. Description Repurposing is as old as human civilization, with many contemporary scholars investigating that way that different societies re- appropriate the artifacts of older cultures in new and creative ways. More recently, repurposing has been celebrated by 21st century hobbyists and arts- and-crafts organizations such as Instructables and other Maker culture communities as a means of creatively responding to the ecological and economic crises of the 21st century. Recent scholarship has attempted to relate these activities to American left- and right-libertarianism.Malewitz, R. (2014) Repurposing is the use of a tool being re-channeled into being another tool, usually for a purpose unintended by the original tool-maker. Typically, repurposing is done using items usually considered to be junk, garbage, or obsolete. A good example of this would be the Earthship style of house, that uses tires as insulating walls and bottles as glass walls. Reuse is not limited to repeated uses for the same purpose. Examples of repurposing include using tires as boat fenders and steel drums or plastic drums as feeding troughs and/or composting bins. Incinerator and power plant exhaust stack fly- ash is used extensively as an additive to concrete, providing increased strength. This type of reuse can sometimes make use of items which are no longer usable for their original purposes, for example using worn-out clothes as rags. Not all repurposing is necessarily environmentally friendly, take for instance the idea of repurposing older work trucks for businesses in their infancy, in which their poor fuel economy can negate long term benefits since greater spending of money for fuel, and more fumes output to the sky can prove to be environmentally unfriendly, in which repurposing vehicles for electric car conversion can be the recommended alternative to that, though its cost can be negligible upfront.

An improvised cowbell, used for sheep or goats. The bell was found in 1988 in a field near Tuqu' (Tekoa) in the Judean hills, the West Bank. The bell's body is made of aluminum, probably a broken kitchen utensil, while the clapper is a brass cartridge case (SMI 25 NATO, probably 7.62√ó51mm). Art *Appropriation (art) is the use of repurposing pre- existing objects or images with little or no transformation applied to them. The use of appropriation has played a significant role in the history of the arts (audiovisual, literary, musical and performing arts). In the audiovisual arts, to appropriate means to properly adopt, borrow, recycle or sample aspects (or the entire form) of human-made audiovisual culture. Notable in this respect are the Readymades of Marcel Duchamp and sampling in Hip Hop music. Automobiles *Full-size vans from the Big Three which have been used for airport shuttle service have been repurposed as church vans mainly because of some depreciation to facilitate affordable cost for thrifty church groups. Electronics *A USB dead drop can be mounted on a brick wall since this gives an opportunity to repurpose older USB flash drives with obsolete capacities to continue service for file transfer (especially anonymous ones) that don't demand more than one gigabyte. * Everdrive and other flash video game cartridges have offered opportunities to download ROM images of video game cartridges onto SD cards while offering opportunities to repurpose real vintage video game consoles for retro gameplay.Stoneagegamer's article on the Everdrive *Old Android smartphones, which tend to have little computing resources yet which are unused and probably contain a triaxial accelerometer of decent specifications, can be used as an amateur seismograph node for a distributed seismography project, e.g., Quake-Catcher Network. *Discarded or new consumer COTS surplus parabolic reflectors intended for use for C band satellite TV reception can be repurposed for a wide gamut of applications for which a consumer-grade reflector of low gain is adequate, incl. amateur microwave SETI (mainly Project Argus), Wi-Fi links, and microwave amateur radio radio beacons.

He wrote the Christmas cantata in Leipzig in 1725 for the Second Day of Christmas, which was celebrated that year as St. Stephen's Day, and first performed it on 26 December 1725.  History and text  Bach wrote the cantata in his third year in Leipzig for the Second Day of Christmas. That year, as every other year in Leipzig, the day was the feast of the martyr St. Stephanus (Stephen). The prescribed readings for the day are from the Acts, the Martyrdom of Stephen (, ), and from the Gospel of Matthew, Jerusalem killing her prophets (). The cantata text was written by Georg Christian Lehms, who drew on all the readings and connected them to more biblical allusions. The first line is taken from , the crown mentioned is in Greek \\"stephanos\\". Lehms set the development as a dialogue of \\"Jesus\\" and the Soul (\\"Anima\\"). He intended to use as a closing chorale a verse from Johann Heermann's \\"\\", but Bach instead chose the 6th verse of Ahasverus Fritsch's \\"\\", called (Talk of the soul with Christ), in order to continue the dialogue. Bach first performed the cantata on 26 December 1725.  Scoring and structure  The setting for the cantata in seven movements is intimate: soprano and bass soloists, two oboes, oboe da caccia, two violins, viola, and continuo. The Anima is sung by the soprano, the bass is the , the voice of Jesus. A four- part choir is only needed for the closing chorale, if at all. The oboes play only in the first and last movement, doubling the strings. # Aria (bass): # Recitative (soprano): # Aria (soprano): # Recitative (soprano, bass): # Aria (bass): # Recitative (soprano, bass): # Aria (soprano): # Chorale:  Music  The music for the dialogue of Jesus and the Soul is more dramatic than in other church cantatas by Bach. Most of the recitatives are secco, as in the opera of the time, driving the action. John Eliot Gardiner sees Bach here as the \\"best writer of dramatic declamation (recitative in other words) since Monteverdi\\". The first aria is dominated by long vocal phrases. In the second aria the longing for death is expressed by an upwards line followed by a wide interval down. The third aria shows Jesus as the victor by fanfare-like broken triads. In the last aria the line of the solo violin can be interpreted as the passionate movement of the Anima into the arms of Jesus. After a mystical union is reached in the second part of the aria, \\"\\" (\\"My Savior, I die with the greatest eagerness\\"), no da capo is possible; the aria ends on the question \\"?\\" (\\"what will You give me?\\"), answered by the final four-part chorale on the tune of \\"\\".

Cond√© was launched on 12 March 1902, and completed on 12 August 1904.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 115, 117‚Äì118 The cost of her construction was 21,594,975 francs. The ship was initially assigned to the 1st Cruiser Division () of the Northern Squadron;Jordan & Caresse, pp. 131, 133, 213 together with her sisters and , Cond√© escorted the remains of John Paul Jones from France to Annapolis, Maryland, and then went on to visit New York City. The ship was transferred to the Mediterranean Squadron's Light Squadron in 1906. By June 1910, after a reorganization that saw the Mediterranean Squadron redesignated as the 1st Squadron () and the Light Squadron split in half, Cond√© and her sisters Gloire and Amiral Aube were assigned to the 2nd Light Division ( (DL)).Jordan & Caresse, pp. 133, 210‚Äì211 As more modern armored cruisers entered service, they were concentrated in the Mediterranean and Cond√© and Gloire joined their sister by January 1911 in the Cruiser Division of the 2nd Squadron, as the Northern Squadron had been redesignated.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 133, 211 In March the sisters visited New York City. When the s began entering service in August, the French Navy reorganized yet again with the 2nd Squadron renumbered as the 3rd and the Cruiser Division was renamed as the 3rd DL. After the Agadir Crisis of 1911, the French and British governments agreed in 1912 that the Royal Navy would defend the northern French coast and the French would concentrate their fleet in the Mediterranean and defend British interests there. The French forces left in the north were consolidated into the 2nd Light Squadron with the 3rd DL redesignated as the 1st Cruiser Squadron. Cond√© was transferred to the Atlantic Division, based in the French West Indies, in early 1914. During the United States occupation of Veracruz beginning in April 1914, the cruiser was frequently off the coast of Mexico to protect French citizens and interests during the Mexican Revolution.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 133, 211, 214‚Äì215, 219 World War I As tensions rose during the July Crisis, Cond√© and the protected cruiser were at Veracruz, Mexico, on 30 July when they were recalled home. The declaration of war between France and Germany on 4 August interrupted these plans, and the next day, the French ships were assigned to the British 4th Cruiser Squadron to join the unsuccessful hunt for the German light cruiser , which was known to be in the area. On 16 October, Cond√© joined with the British armored cruiser to search for the German ship off the coast of Brazil. Concerned that the German East Asia Squadron might try and pass through the newly opened Panama Canal, the British Admiralty concentrated all its available cruisers in the West Indies on 8 November until the German ships were spotted off the coast of Chile five days later. Unbeknownst to the Allies, Karlsruhe had been destroyed by an internal explosion on 8 November, but Cond√© and Descartes remained in the West Indies until August 1915.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 219, 226‚Äì227 On 14 February Cond√© relieved the light cruiser watching the interned German merchant ships in San Juan, Puerto Rico.Corbett, p. 254 By January 1916 Cond√© had been joined by Marseillaise in the West Indies and they were joined by their other two sisters in May when yet another reorganization recreated the 3rd DL which was tasked to search for German commerce raiders. Cond√© returned to France for a refit at the Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde shipyard in Bordeaux in July. With the reduced threat from commerce raiders in 1917, the numbers of armored cruisers were reduced and the Atlantic and Antilles Division () was organized to control them. Cond√© joined the unit in late 1917 and the division was tasked with escorting convoys bound for Europe from Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, beginning on 15 February 1918. The cruiser, however, departed the West Indies on 1 March. During her absence the division had been renamed the Atlantic Division when she rejoined the unit as a replacement for the torpedoed armored cruiser in August.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 242, 245, 248, 250 Cond√© was still assigned to the division when the war ended on 11 November, but she had returned to France by 28 May 1919 when the ship transported 176 mutineers from French colonial infantry units from Brest to Casablanca, French Morocco. Cond√© relieved the armored cruiser in the Arctic on 25 June and covered the withdrawal of French troops from Arkhangelsk and the subsequent evacuation of Murmansk by Allied forces on 12 October. The ship was reduced to special reserve on 15 March 1920 at Brest and became a barracks ship for the naval infantry () two years later at Lorient. In 1928, Cond√© hosted the Naval Infantry School (); she was stricken from the naval register on 15 February 1933 and converted into a hulk.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 250, 257 She was captured by the Germans in June 1940 who used her as a submarine depot ship. She was sunk by Allied aircraft in 1944 and her wreck was salvaged in 1954 and broken up for scrap.Jordan & Caresse, p. 257  Notes  References   1902 ships Gloire-class cruisers ","title":"French cruiser Cond√©"},{"id":"30041744","text":"Sir Nathaniel Barnardiston (1588 - 25 July 1653) of Kedington, Suffolk was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons variously between 1625 and 1648.J.P.

Unlike her sisters, the cruiser remained in the Northern Squadron until she was placed in reserve in mid-1911. The ship was reactivated at the beginning of 1914 and was assigned to the 2nd Light Squadron (), as the units based in northwestern France had been renamed, together with two of her sisters. When World War I began in August 1914, she was assigned to patrol the English Channel to enforce the blockade of Germany. Amiral Aube was transferred to the Eastern Mediterranean in late 1915 where she patrolled off the coast of Ottoman-controlled territory. To help protect Allied shipping from German commerce raiders, the ship was transferred to the French West Indies in mid-1916. In early 1918, Amiral Aube was briefly assigned to escort convoys from the West Indies to Europe. The ship was sent to Murmansk in March to support Allied forces when they intervened in the Russian Civil War.

Their secondary armament comprised eight QF 164.7 mm Mod√®le 1893‚Äì1896 guns and six QF Canon de Mod√®le de 1893 guns. Half of the 164.7 mm guns were in two single-gun wing turrets on each broadside and all of the remaining guns were on single mounts in casemates in the hull.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 305 For defense against torpedo boats, they carried eighteen and four Hotchkiss guns, all of which were in single mounts. The sisters were also armed with five torpedo tubes, of which two were submerged and three above water. Two of these were on each broadside and the fifth tube was in the stern. All of the above-water tubes were on pivot mounts. The ships varied in the number of naval mines that they could carry and Amiral Aube was fitted with storage for 10.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 125‚Äì126 The Gloire class were the first French armored cruisers to have their waterline armored belt made from Harvey face-hardened armor plates. The belt ranged in thickness from . Because of manufacturing limitations, the thinner end plates were nickel steel. Behind the belt was a cofferdam, backed by a longitudinal watertight bulkhead.

The 1st DL covered the transports ferrying the British 6th Infantry Division from Southampton to Saint-Nazaire on 9‚Äì10 September. On 27 October the French patrols in the Channel were reorganized with Amiral Aube and Gloire tasked to reinforce the smaller cruisers now conducting the patrols.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 219, 223‚Äì225 After the eastern entrance to the Channel was sealed off with anti-submarine nets and minefields in 1915, the armored cruisers were no longer required and Amiral Aube was sent to the Eastern Mediterranean late that year. She arrived on 24 December and was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 3rd Squadron which patrolled off the Egyptian and Levantine coasts. The constant patrolling caused a lot of wear and tear on the ship's propulsion machinery and she required frequent repairs until she was sent to Brest for a refit in March 1916. Two months later, after another reorganization, Amiral Aube and all of her sisters were assigned to the 3rd DL which was tasked with patrolling the West Indies in search of German commerce raiders. Together with Gloire, Amiral Aube departed Brest on 20 May, bound for Fort-de-France in the colony of Martinique. The 3rd DL was disbanded and the remaining cruisers in the West Indies were assigned to the Atlantic and Antilles Division () on 1 June 1917.

The company was a joint venture between SKD truck maker Yarovit and the ONEXIM investment group. On 7 April 2014 it was announced that the project was sold to the Russian government for ‚Ç¨1, because \\"...the sharp weakening of the auto market has made it impossible to go ahead with the project, and make a profit.\\". , no production vehicles were ever produced. Background The car was introduced on 13 December 2010 in Moscow, a product of a joint venture between Yarovit, owner of a small assembly plant in St. Petersburg, Russia and the Onexim investment group, headed by Mikhail Prokhorov, who is the leader and financier of the project. Prokhorov planned to invest around ‚Ç¨150 million (US$200 million) in a venture, dubbed Yo-auto. According to Prokhorov, he intended for the vehicle to \\"break the stereotype saying Russia can't produce good cars.\\" Design The car was designed to be powered by an engine that can burn both gasoline and natural gas. The series hybrid no-transmission layout uses an electric generator that feeds its power directly into the car's two rear electric motors, unlike parallel hybrid cars like the Toyota Prius. A super capacitor would provide a small but powerful energy buffer. It was planned to install a rotary vane type engine, with the pistons moving in a circle, rather than linearly. The design includes a plastic body that can be recycled to make other structural components. Another feature is the ability for the vehicle to become a 20 kW power station for a house or business during a grid failure. Fuel economy of the car was expected to be around , with a range of and a top speed of . However, no tests were conducted due to the lack of working examples.  Criticism  The project has been criticized by Russian automotive specialists.http://www.autonews.ru/autobusiness/news.shtml?/2010/04/07/1541034 for a number of reasons: * Overly ambitious plans for a company that has never designed or produced vehicles before; Yarovit only did Complete knock down assembly of trucks based on large Terberg components. * Designing a vehicle around high-tech components (engine) that do not exist even in experimental status * High center of gravity, making it susceptible to roll-overhttp://trv- science.ru/2011/07/05/yo-mobil-innovacii-na-marshe/ * Archaic design, resembling go-carts by its body and mining equipment by the drivetrain * Use of capacitors as power storage deviceshttp://www.yo- auto.ru/innovation/nakopitel-energii/ which have numerous disadvantages and may become dangerous in certain circumstances * Dynamic driving properties declared earlier may not match practicals due to power leak caused by additional electric equipment (like lights, air conditioning etc.). * No physical safety tests results were announced as of June 2012. The inventor of the engine Mikhail Virgiyanov in an open letter to the company later refused to continue work on the engine and accused the company of copyright infringement.http://www.professor-butakov.ru/history/view_history.php?id=1 History Yo-auto initially planned to begin producing the car during the second half of 2012, and had aims to sell 10,000 during the first year of production. However, these plans were revised in 2012, with the estimated start of production was moved to early 2015, a plan that never came to fruition. While it will be initially sold in Russia, Yo-auto planned to sell the vehicle in Europe subject to compliance with European Union regulations. The cars was to be manufactured in a factory near St. Petersburg that would have an estimated annual capacity of 45,000 units. A second factory, to be opened later, was expected to double the annual production rate. However, these plans were also revised in 2013, with the estimated total annual production rate were targeted at 40,000 units.

Originally known as Carcass Creek, Grover is a small ranching community off the county's main recreational corridor. Geography Grover lies some southeast of Torrey, on State Route 12. It sits just outside Dixie National Forest, at the northeastern flank of Boulder Mountain. To the east is Capitol Reef National Park. The community is small and scattered, but roughly bounded by two small streams, tributaries of the Fremont River. Fish Creek is on the west, Carcass Creek on the east. Carcass Creek was so named due to its steep banks, which proved hazardous to livestock. The former State Route 117 runs west and north from Grover to Teasdale, another small unincorporated community whose post office serves Grover. History The first settlers on Carcass Creek were experienced Wayne County ranchers who arrived in 1880. In 1881, more cattlemen settled along Fish Creek. A small number of residents scattered through the area over the next few years. These early settlers referred to their settlement as Carcass Creek. In 1887, the Mormon residents were organized into a congregation called the Carcass Creek Branch, although meetings were held only irregularly due to the distances among homes. In the early 1890s the growing town was granted a post office, and the name was changed to Grover in honor of U.S. President Grover Cleveland. The Grover Irrigation Company organized in 1893 to build and manage structures for drawing and distributing water from Fish Creek Lake. The first school classes were held in the winter of 1892-1893, and the first log school/church/community building was built about 1900. In 1935, a new school building was built in Grover. A stuccoed log one-room school, the Grover School was built with funds and labor provided mainly by the Works Progress Administration. Unlike other area schools, it had a fence and lawn. Due to Grover's small size, the school board quickly decided the school was an unnecessary expense; within three years the older children were sent to school in Bicknell, and in 1941 the Grover School was closed. The building has remained largely intact, and in 1986 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Demographics Even for sparsely populated Wayne County, Grover has always been a small community with few inhabitants. Through all the years that it was enumerated as a census precinct in the United States Census, from 1900 to 1950, the population never reached 100. The annual Fourth of July celebration in Grover has become a reunion of current and former residents; in 1973 the number of attendees was \\"more than 200\\". Economy Like much of Wayne County, Grover's economy traditionally depended on ranching, but has been supplemented in recent decades by the tourist trade from Capitol Reef National Park and other regional recreation. The scenic location has become an attractive place for vacation homes. The Hale Family Theatre, one of several theater companies run by the family of Ruth Hale, produces plays through the summer months in a rustic barn theater at the family's Grover ranch. Education Since the closure of the Grover School in 1941, Grover has had no schools of its own. Children attend school in Bicknell and Loa.

He belonged to the family of Gardƒìzƒ´ Sadaat. Biography Qazi Syed Rafi Mohammad (alias Qazi Dasondhi) was a scholar of repute from Sakras, District Gurgaon (Haryana). He belonged to the family of Gardƒìzƒ´ Sadaat. His copies of many judgments as Islamic lawyer were preserved in the Library of Hakim Syed Karam Husain at Tijara, Alwar. Family history After the Changez khan's massacre in Iran (Destruction under the Mongol Empire), his family members migrated from Mashhad (Iran) to Sabzwar and then to India via Gardƒìz (Afghanistan) during the reign of Sultan Shams-ud-din Iltutmish (1211‚Äì1235). In India, this family was acclaimed later on as Gardƒìzƒ´ Sadaat and received many honorific titles from Mughal emperors. According to Akhbarul Akhyar by Shaikh Abdul-Haqq Dehlavi, the two brothers Mir Syed Shahabuddin and Mir Syed Shamsuddin Daod who belonged to Gardezi Sadaat came to Delhi during Iltutmish times. The family of Mir Syed Shahabuddin was settled in Manikpur while the family of Mir Syed Shamsuddin Daod stayed at the region of Mewat. From the family of Manikpur, Raji Hamid Shah (caliph Shaikh Hisamuddin Manikpuri) was a famous scholar.Akhbarul Akhyar, Abdul-Haqq Dehlavi (d.1642 c.e.), Manuscript p 153 The Lineal descendant of both these brothers in Mewat and Manikpur are remembered as Gardezi Sadaat. According to Tarikhul Aimma fi Zikr Khulafai Ummah by Mir Mahboob Ali, \\"some family members of Syed Shamsuddin Daod were settled in Sabzwar, and hence also known as Syed Sabzwari\\".Tarikhul Aimma fi Zikr Khulafal Ummah, Mir Mahboob Ali (died 1863 AD/1280 AH), Manuscript p 236 In relation to Gardez, Sultan Iltumish knew the family of Mir Syed Shamsuddin very well especially his father 'Mir Zainuddin' from Gardez. Sultan allowed to marry his sister with Mir Syed Shamsuddin. After the demise of his sister, his daughter got married with Mir Syed Shamsuddin. In this way, Mir Syed Shamsuddin enjoyed the royal courtship and remained with Sultan Iltumish. He had two sons Mir Imaduddin and Mir Azduddin. Mir Syed Shamsuddin died either during the reign of Nasiruddin Mahmud or in the period of Ghiyas ud din Balban. Because of close association with Sultan Iltumish, his family members were sent to jail during the reign of Jalal ud din Firuz Khalji and then Alauddin Khalji. When Alauddin Khalji killed his uncle Jalaluddin Khalji in 1295 AD/ 695 AH, many prisoners ran away from the jails and many were killed. In this mayhem and confusion, Mir Imaduddin with his nephew Burhanuddin ran away and fled Delhi to Ranthambore with Muhammad Shah, a rebel general of Sultan Alauddin Khalji in 1299 AD. At that time, Hammir Dev Chauhan was the king of Ranthambore Fort. During the attack of Alauddin Khalji in 701AH/1301AD, both Mir Imaduddin and Burhanuddin were martyred and buried near the gate of Ranthambore FortNuzhatul Khawatir, Hakim Syed Abdul Hai Lukhnawi (see Abul Hasan Ali Hasani Nadwi), Volume 1, p 170 After Mir Imaduddin‚Äôs martyr, his family members including his son Syed Shamsuddin Sani (alias Syed Chajju Jagat Jaut) remained in Ranthambore for few more decades. According to Tarikh-i-Firuz_Shahi by Ziauddin Barani, the families that belonged in the period of Sultan Iltutmish and remained in the period of Ghiyas ud din Balban were also from ancestors of Syed Chajju.Tarikh-i-Firuz_Shahi, Ziauddin Barani, pp 111 The name of Syed Chajju Gardezi is found in many books and journals.

According to Hakim Syed Karam Husain, the family of Syed Chajju were later on bestowed with vast lands by many kings near the areas of Mewat in return for their great services. Apart from Sakras (Mewat), some members of Mir Imaduddin and Mir Burhanuddin were also settled in Gujarat and Deccan. From the Gujarat family, Qazi Mahmood (846 AH / 1442 AD ‚Äì 925 AH / 1519 AD) got a reputation as scholar about whom Abdul-Haqq Dehlavi (d.1642 c.e.) mentioned in his manuscript as a great 'Sufi Shaikh' of Gujarat.Akhbarul Akhyar, Shaikh Abdul-Haqq Muhaddis Dehlavi, Manuscript dated 22 Rabiul Awwal 1158 AH / 1745 AD Qazi Mahmood lived a good life during the Sultanate period of Gujarat at Ahmedabad at the times of Sultan Shams-ud Din Muzaffar Shah II (son of Sultan Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah I). From Ahmedabad, he shifted to his native place 'Sarpore' (Gujarat) in 920 AH / 1514 AD where he lived till death.

(Specifically, they argue that the far north should be retained by Canada outright, and that the Outaouais, Abitibi-T√©miscamingue, most of Montreal, the territory to the south of the Saint Lawrence River, and some borderlands with Labrador would likely remain in Canada following negotiations).Much of Shaw and Albert's book is devoted to this theme. A map of their proposed partition appears on William Shaw and Lionel Albert, Partition - The Price of Quebec's Independence, (Montreal: Thornhill Publishing), 1980, p. 24. Eugene Forsey wrote a foreword to this book (pp. 13-16), although he did not agree with all of Shaw and Albert's conclusions. See also Peter Brimelow, \\"It's not too late for Quebec's Anglophones\\", Financial Post, 12 September 1989, p. 13. Shaw and Albert also suggest that separation will never happen, on the grounds that nationalist francophone Quebecers have used the threat of separation to extract concessions from the federal government but recognize actual independence would harm their community.Shaw and Albert, Partition, p. 32. They further argue that French Canadians inside and outside Quebec are a distinct group with the right of self-determination, but that residents of the province of Quebec are not.Shaw and Albert, Partition, p. 140. Albert has continued to express these and similar opinions since Partition's publication. In 1990, for instance, he argued that English Canadians were taking the threat of separatism too seriously.Lionel Albert, \\"Taking separatism too seriously\\", Financial Post, 6 December 1990, p. 16; Sarah Scott, \\"What would the \`NEW QUEBEC' look like?\\", Montreal Gazette, 2 February 1991, B1; Lionel Albert, \\"Prediction is made,\\" Montreal Gazette, 13 February 1991, B2. In a public debate in 1994, he suggested that Quebec should be partitioned to prevent more anglophone youth from leaving the province.Geoff Baker, \\"Threat of partition will make separatists think twice, unity spokesman says\\", Montreal Gazette, 17 December 1995, A8. Albert's criticisms of Quebec nationalism have sometimes provoked controversy. In early 1990, he wrote a piece in the Montreal paper The Suburban comparing Quebec‚Äôs language legislation to Nazism. (When Michael Crelinsten of the Canadian Jewish Congress objected to this analogy, Albert responded by attacking Crelinsten in print.)Albert Nerenberg, \\"West-end weekly tabloid gives readers bizarre world view\\", Montreal Gazette, 13 February 1990, A2. According to Nerenberg's article, Albert likened Crelinsten to a supporter of Hermann G√∂ring. Presumably this analogy, if reported accurately, was intended to be taken as facetious. See also Aaron Derfel, \\"Francophone group angry despite paper's apology\\", Montreal Gazette, 1 March 1990, G7. In the same period, Albert wrote another piece for The Suburban suggesting that francophone Quebecers were \\"country people\\" and that anglophone Quebecers were \\"city people.\\"\\"Weekly newspaper says it's sorry\\", Montreal Gazette, 19 February 1990, A3. The paper later apologized for Albert's articles.\\"Paper apologizes for \`offensive statements'\\", Montreal Gazette, 22 February 1990, A6. Political activism In 1976, Albert became active with an organization called \\"The Preparatory Committee for an Eleventh Province\\". He has acknowledged that his primary concern was to remove language restrictions from anglophone Quebecers.Shaw and Albert, Partition, p. 29. Shaw was involved with the same organization, although not for the same reasons. Albert joined the executive of the Equality Party of Quebec, which was focused on anglophone rights, shortly after its founding in 1989.Robert McKenzie, \\"Bourassa still strong despite language row\\", Toronto Star, 5 April 1989, A22. When speaking at a party rally that year, he argued that the government of Canada could be justified in sending the Canadian Army into Quebec because of threats to the anglophone minority.Don MacPherson, \\"New party poses little real threat\\", Montreal Gazette, 30 March 1989, B3. A Montreal Gazette article subsequently described Albert as belonging to a \\"redneck anglo-rights fringe\\" distinct from more mainstream supporters of anglophone rights.Hubert Bauch, \\"'Getty the Boo' is West Island anglos' new rallying cry\\", Montreal Gazette, 1 April 1989, B1. Equality Party leader Robert Libman also clarified that Albert‚Äôs views were not those of the party.Elizabeth Thompson, \\"Radicals lead Renaud to shun party's rallies\\", Montreal Gazette, 2 April 1989, A3. For his part, Albert later said that he did not favour sending federal troops to Quebec, but believed that the federal government should act with \\"all the force at its command\\" to protect what he described as threats to a minority culture.\\"Sending troops to Quebec opposed\\", Montreal Gazette, 12 April 1989, B2. In the 1993 Canadian federal election, Albert ran as a candidate of the unregistered Equality Party of Canada, which was aligned with the provincial party.Tu Thanh Ha, \\"Equality wants Ottawa to move in on billboard law\\", Montreal Gazette, 17 October 1993, A5. During this campaign, he was quoted as saying, \\"The anglo minority in Quebec is just not represented in the House of Commons.\\"Karen Seidman, \\"One thing fringe candidates have is heart\\", Montreal Gazette, 21 October 1993, G8. He finished well behind Liberal candidate Bernard Patry. Albert joined the Reform Party of Canada after the 1993 election. He attended the party‚Äôs 1994 convention and supported its call for an end to Canada‚Äôs Official Languages Act.Sheldon Alberts, \\"Reformers toughen stand against crime\\", Ottawa Citizen, 16 October 1994, A6. He later criticized the Canadian Alliance, a successor party to Reform, for working too closely with Quebec nationalists.Lionel Albert, \\"The Canadian Alliance's mistake in Quebec\\", Ottawa Citizen, 2 August 2000, A17; Lionel Albert, \\"Alliance should woo federalists\\", Montreal Gazette, 24 October 2002, A27. In the 2003 Quebec provincial election, Albert ran for the Equality Party in Brome‚ÄîMissisquoi. He again focused on language issues, saying that incumbent Liberal representative Pierre Paradis had not defended the rights of local anglophones.\\"Lionel Albert to carry Equality colors in Brome-Missisquoi\\", Sherbrooke Record, 19 March 2003, p. 4. The Equality Party was nearly moribund in this period; on election day, Albert received less than one per cent of the vote. In the 2008 Canadian federal election, he supported Conservative candidate Mark Quinlan.Lionel Albert, \\"Quinlan my Choice\\", Sherbrooke Record, 19 September 2008, p. 8. Other views Albert is a prolific writer of opinion columns and public letters on diverse subjects. Among other things, he written against the metric system, criticized Pete Seeger as a communist propagandist, praised Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, defended Monsanto, and supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq.Lionel Albert, \\"Computers reduce the need for metric\\", Montreal Gazette, 14 January 1985, B3; \\"Seeger stripes are red\\", Montreal Gazette, 12 December 1985, B2; \\"Mugabe's Zimbabwe resembles Allende's Chile\\", Montreal Gazette, 18 September 2003, A30; Lionel Albert, \\"Monsanto wrongly attacked\\", Sherbrooke Record, 23 May 2008, p. 6; Lionel Albert, \\"Sometimes war is necessary\\", Sherbrooke Record, 11 November 2003, p. 6. During the 2004 American presidential election, Albert attempted to counter the perception that George W. Bush received support from less intelligent American voters. His public letter on this subject included the statement, \\"Bush leads 55-42 among whites while Kerry leads 82-12 among blacks, who on average are less educated.\\"Lionel Albert, \\"Bush appeals to the intelligent\\", Montreal Gazette, 16 October 2004, A30. He is also opposed to abortion. In 1992, he wrote a piece comparing abortionists with hangmen.\\"Treated too kindly?\\", Montreal Gazette, 14 April 1992, B2. Albert has written that he is not a Zionist.\\"Not relevant evidence\\", Montreal Gazette, 3 August 2007, A18.

This aim is often more specifically structured as a requirement for contractors awarded certain types of publicly funded projects to recruit a certain proportion of the people working on the project from a particular area. Proponents of local hiring ordinances claim the practice: * ensures that tax dollars are invested back into the local economy * reduces the environmental impact of commuting * fosters community involvement * preserves local employment opportunities in construction Opponents of local hiring ordinances point to economic factors and public policy argumentative: * a restricted pool of labor will result in higher costs * constraints of local hire will drive prices up, as contractors will factor in compliance costs and/or choose to not bid * municipal cost of oversight detracts from public benefit * the extent to which local hiring provides opportunities for local workers may also restrict opportunities for other local workers outside of their local catchment area The environmental benefit of local hiring comes principally because employing a greater percentage of local workers leads to shorter commutes and a greater ability to walk, bike, and take public transit to work. This results in reductions in air pollution, including greenhouse gases. Local hiring is an aspect of the relocalization movement. Mandating that contractors hire locally means residents can work closer to home, spending less time traveling to and from their jobs. As Robert D. Putnam notes in Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community, each additional ten minutes spent commuting leads to a ten percent decline in all areas of civic engagement. Therefore, local hiring may be one tool municipalities can use to increase community involvement. The other positive aspects that comes with local hiring is the fact that the people who shall be hired have great knowledge of the local culture and are more experienced on the business practices of the local area. this is an implication that it will be easy to conduct business locally. The City and County of San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed the strongest local hiring ordinance in the United States on December 14, 2010. This legislation, sponsored by Supervisor John Avalos, requires 20% of construction workers on city projects in 2011-12 to live locally, rising to 50% by 2017. 50% of apprentices on these projects must live locally. The ordinance has per-trade requirements set at half the overall level (e.g. by 2017, 25% of workers in any trade must live locally). The local hire requirement replaced a previous goal-based approach that had proved ineffective, with only 20% of hours on city project being worked by San Francisco residents in the period July 2009 to late 2010. The new ordinance became law on March 25, 2011. Oftentimes, companies will set up a stand at a local university to make themselves for accessible to the community and easier to have a face-to-face meeting to determine the right candidate. They could have two or, possibly, three representatives willing to speak to whomever comes to the table. The company often offers corporate giveaway items (aka. \\"Swag\\") to the individual they talk to or anyone who appears interested in their company. The United States Office of Personnel Management says, \\"Swag items are commonly distributed to all employees or participants at a particular event for the sole purpose of promoting or advertising the agency or organization.\\" References Recruitment New Urbanism Localism (politics) ","title":"Local hiring"},{"id":"30042110","text":"Gerda Geertens (born 11 August 1955) is a Dutch composer.

Tinkle, Jungrak Phromchairak, John Egelhoff, Raouf Amin, Narong Simakajornboon. \\"Sleep-Related Respiratory Abnormalities and Arousal Pattern in Achondroplasia During Early Infancy.\\" The Journal of Pediatrics 155.4 (2009): 510-515. Achondroplasia falls into the category of ‚Äúdisproportionate dwarfism‚Äù. It is linked to a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3. More than 250,000 people in the world are diagnosed with achondroplasia. Achondroplasia diagnosis occurs somewhere between one in every 10,000 and one in every 30,000 live births.Horton, William A., Judith G. Hall, Jacqueline T. Hecht. \\"Achondroplasia.\\" The Lancet 370.9582 (2007): 162-172. Some symptoms of achondroplasia are short stature, a long and narrow trunk, shortening of the proximal segments of limbs, large head, mid-face hypoplasia, and joint hyperextension, among others. Achondroplasia is defined by central nervous system defects as well as the prior physical symptoms. Average height for an adult man or woman diagnosed with achondroplasia is about 120 centimeters (47.2 inches), although technically a maximum of 148 centimeters (58.2 inches) is also considered achondroplastic.Trotter, Tracy L., Judith G. Hall. \\"Health Supervision for Children with Achondroplasia\\" Pediatrics. 116.3 (2005): 771‚Äì783 Achondroplastic people typically have a long trunk and smaller upper legs and upper arms. Those are of normal intelligence and able to lead independent and productive lives. Presentation Because achondroplastic children have different genes, their growth cycle should be expected to differ from that of a non-achondroplastic child. It is very typical for an achondroplastic child to snore because of their smaller than average size airways. There is no data that unfailingly states respiratory problems. Even though achondroplastic children have reduced lung volumes, this does not seem to result in respiratory problems.Tasker, Robert C., Isobel Dundas, Aidan Laverty, Margaret Fletcher, Roderick Lane, Janet Stocks. ‚ÄúDistinct Patterns of Respiratory Difficulty in Young Children with Achondroplasia: A Clinical, Sleep, and Lung Function Study.‚Äù Archives of Disease in Childhood. 79.2 (1998): 99-108. Children diagnosed with achondroplasia usually have delayed motor milestones, otitis media, and bowing of the lower legs. Achondroplastic infants also need to be watched carefully the first few years of infancy for support problems. An infant or child‚Äôs hearing and sight needs to be monitored through the years. Along with their development of hearing and sight, their posture will not be guaranteed to develop perfectly to support the child. Achondroplastic children may also encounter speech impediment in their early years. If a child that is diagnosed is falling behind or lacking in any of these areas, they should be taken to a pediatrician for help to restore the children to where they should be. Young children may have health issues that are related to upper-airway obstruction. Typical for achondroplastic children, as well, is sweating more than is average for children. Achondroplastic children‚Äôs diets should be watched very closely because it is easy for children to become obese when they are young. Their diets should be restricted to smaller portions than that of a child who is not diagnosed with achondroplasia. Gastroesophageal reflux is more common in achondroplastic children as well and should be treated and watched very closely if it furthers already heightened respiratory problems. Most infants diagnosed with achondroplasia will develop thoracolumbar kyphosis, which will need to be treated delicately so they can develop good posture with much care. If not watched properly or treated carefully, thoracolumbar kyphosis can help lead to spinal stenosis. Diagnosis  A child may be diagnosed with achondroplasia as early as the fetal stages of pregnancy. Most cases are first identified as early as 26 weeks in the gestational period. 85% of children born with achondroplasia are born of parents who are average height who are not themselves achondroplastic. However, 75% of all cases are the result of de novo, or entirely new, genetic mutations. If both parents are diagnosed with achondroplasia, however, there is a higher chance of life-threatening problems. Management Achondroplastic children require special attention as they grow up and age. The home setting for an achondroplastic child should be modified in a way that is fitting for a child with a growth mutation. Toys should be considered and altered to fit the needs of the child, or size of the child, such as tricycles and backyard playground equipment. Other fixtures in the home should be replaced to attainable heights for the children such as light switches or door knobs. Because achondroplastic children tend to have weaker posture, supporting cushions should be considered in use as well as stools for their feet when they are sitting down. For an achondroplastic child to develop better, activities such as biking or swimming should be included in their daily schedule. Such activities may help with strength in the limbs and posture and will help to avert the problems of thoracolumbar kyphosis and spinal stenosis. Other activities, like gymnastics or rough sports should be avoided because they will help with the deteriorating of their back support and posture. Achondroplastic children should also be worked with daily on their verbal skills, so as to help them overcome the speech impediments they may likely encounter. Prevalence Achondroplastic births are completely sporadic and the chances of having another child who is also achondroplastic is not more likely than for anyone else - having an achondroplastic child is entirely situational. There are specific ways to raise a child diagnosed with achondroplasia that will be beneficial to their growth and aging. Achondroplastic children, to be given better chances, must be raised with greater care than children who are not.

Korpilahti Church is almost 200 years old, dating back to 1827. The present structure is the third wooden church to have been built on that site. A meticulous renovation was completed in 2018, restoring the church to its original appearance. The ochre-yellow hue of the exterior walls was reproduced from old exterior cladding boards that were found hidden behind the vestry porch. The clocks on the tower were repainted, and intricate decorations were exposed from under the sheet metal. The church hall was restored in the 1920s according to plans by young Alvar Aalto. The festive appearance of the church hall is completed by the black doors with rosettes, a beautiful altar railing, the ornate patterns on the beams, the red floors, the black marble-painted lower parts of the walls, the gilded sun on the inner dome and numerous other fine details.The decorative belfry next to the church was designed by Alfred Cav√©n and built by Gustaf Kuorikoski in 1886. The current 22-voice organ was designed by B.A. Thul√© and dates from 1904. Korpilahti Church is dated back to 1827. History The first church in Korpilahti was a modest church hut that was erected in the late 17th century on a spot next to the harbour where the military cemetery is now located. The exact year of its construction is not known, but the church bell that was installed shortly thereafter dates back to 1701. A second church building was erected on the same spot next to the Kirkkolahti ‚ÄúChurch Bay‚Äù in the 1750s. In 1753 itinerant church-builder Arvi Junkkarinen (1716-1777) of Lepp√§virta began construction of cruciform church, which was completed on the same site by 18th-century master carpenter Jaakko Lepp√§nen in 1764 and 1765,Jaakko Klementinpoika Lepp√§nen, Biografiakeskus. Retrieved 2010-12-13. Lepp√§nen's son, also named Jaakko (1741-1805), made a separate wooden church belfry in 1777.Korpilahden Kirkko, Keski-Suomen Kirkot. Retrieved 2010-12-13. The lower part of the belfry is a remnant of this church building. The building later served as a grain warehouse and now houses the local history museum. Construction of the present church was first proposed in 1813. The old building was dilapidated and no longer big enough for the community. Eventually, after a long-drawn-out process, the decision was taken to build the new church. Construction on yet a third church building, designed by A.W. Arppe and approved by the Italian-born architect Charles Bassi (1772‚Äì1840), was begun by Eerik Lepp√§nen (1776-1856) and completed by Herman Nyberg of Hauho (now H√§meenlinna) in 1826-1827. The new church, however, was structurally weak. Based on a design by church builder Taavetti Rahikainen in 1838 the dome was replaced, giving the church its present octagonal tower. Four large columns were erected in the church hall with connecting beams supporting the dome. H√§meenlinna architect Alfred Cav√©n designed the decorative belfry next to the church and it was built by Gustaf Kuorikoski in 1886.Alfred Cav√©n, detailed biography (Finnish), 27 October 2011. Retrieved 2011-11-11. The church underwent a major renovation on its hundredth anniversary. The plans for the renovation were made by a young architect by the name of Alvar Aalto. The extensive renovation covered the front walls of the church and redesigned the dome, ceiling and arched windows. Windbreak rooms were built for the outer doors, and the balconies were extended. The interior was also given a new colour, and brass candleholders were attached to the ends of the benches. In 1964 conservator Thorvald Lindqvist carried out next renovations: the colour, altar railing and heating system were all renewed. The following major renovation was planned by architect Matti Huusari and completed in 1992, when the lower floor was uncovered and repaired, the tile roof was renewed and the tin roof was painted. In addition, the interior was repainted, the choir section was enlarged, and the altar railing was made into a full circle. Painter Tuomas M√§ntynen decorated the supporting columns and beams of the dome with naive paintings containing Christian symbolism. Planning for the church‚Äôs most recent major renovation began in 2015. Leaks had been detected in the room of the church, and upon closer examination it was found that the dome section had sunk by nearly 40 centimetres. Further detailed investigations also identified other major repair needs: the structure of the church dome had to be strengthened and stiffened, areas of rot had to be repaired, and the tin roof needed to be replaced. The church also had to be repainted both inside and out. As part of the renovation, the church's sprinkler and heating systems were renewed. In addition, the church's lighting and sound system were modernised, and drop-down screens and video projectors were installed at the front of the church. The chief architect of the extensive renovation was Tuija Ilves.  Altarpieces and organs  Carl Fredrik Blom was commissioned to paint the exterior and interior of the church in 1839. Blom also painted an altarpiece depicting the Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane and images of the apostles, prophets and holy wives on the sides of the balconies. The current altarpiece, Come to Me, All You Who are Weary, was painted by Professor Wilho Sj√∂str√∂m in 1905. The first organ was installed in Korpilahti Church as early as 1853. Organs were still a rarity in rural churches at the time. The nearest organ had been in Kuopio, almost 200 km to the northeast.Kirkko , Korpilahti. Retrieved 2010-12-13. The first cantor of the church was V.T. Forsgren, father of the local poet Martti Korpilahti. The current 22-voice organ was designed by B.A. Thul√© and dates from 1904. The organ has survived in its original form, albeit with the later addition of a fan, and is now part of the Sibelius Academy's collection of Finnish historical organs and protected by the National Board of Antiquities.

Education Buswell was born in Burlington, Wisconsin. He received an A.B. from the University of Minnesota (1917), a B.D. from McCormick Theological Seminary (1923), an M.A. from the University of Chicago, and his Ph.D. from New York University (1949). Professional life He served as a chaplain in the 140th Infantry during World War I. After pastorates in a Presbyterian church in Milwaukee (1919‚Äì1922) and a Reformed church in Brooklyn (1922‚Äì26), Buswell became president of Wheaton College from 1926 to 1940. He then served as president of the National Bible Institute of New York City, and its successor, Shelton College, in Ringwood, New Jersey from 1941 to 1955. And finally, in 1956, he became dean of Covenant College (1956‚Äì1964) and Covenant Theological Seminary (1956‚Äì1970) in St. Louis, Missouri. The libraries at both Wheaton College and Covenant Theological Seminary bear his name. Tenure as President of Wheaton College In January 1926, the young Rev. Buswell was on the campus of Wheaton College to deliver a week's worth of chapel sermons. Within weeks, college trustees invited Buswell to become Wheaton's third president (and first ever not named Blanchard). He was the youngest college president at 31 years old. Over the next 14 years, Buswell oversaw a significant period of growth in both numbers and academic rigor. He guided the college through the process of accreditation, bolstered its curriculum (especially in the sciences), increased the percentage of full-time faculty with Ph.D.'s from 24% to 49%, and saw the enrollment grow from 400 to 1,100. However, Buswell's staunch Calvinism, fundamentalist separatism, and his reportedly difficult temperament made his tenure at Wheaton an uneasy one. After years of contentious relations on campus, the Wheaton board of trustees fired Buswell.George Marsden, Reforming Fundamentalism: Fuller Seminary and the New Evangelicalism (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans Publishing, 1987), 45. Doctrinal Distinctives Although not a dispensationalist, he was a premillennialist who believed in what pre-tribulationists call a \\"mid- tribulation rapture.\\" (Actually, he believed that the Bible term tribulation only applies to the 2nd half of Daniel's 70th week; thus a so-called \\"mid- tribulationist\\" may well call himself a \\"pre-tribulationist.\\") He authored dozens of articles and eleven books, most notably, A Systematic Theology of the Christian Religion, 2 vols. (1962‚Äì63), now out-of-print. Peculiar beliefs of Buswell include his theory that Melchizedek was a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ and that God's omnipresence does not mean that His existence extends throughout the universe‚Äîone may think of the universe as in God's lap. Fundamentalist Churchman Buswell was a staunch Calvinist who held to the Westminster Standards and Covenant theology. He was considered a fundamentalist, given his firm stand against the modernist accommodation within mainline Protestant denominations and his insistence on holding to the historic fundamentals (basics) of Christian doctrine. In 1936, he was dismissed from the ministry of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. for the part that he played in the Independent Mission Board controversy, and became a figure in the founding of what would become the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. The following year, he joined another fundamentalist Carl McIntire in forming the Bible Presbyterian Church. He would later participate in the Evangelical Presbyterian Church (formerly the Bible Presbyterian Church, Columbus Synod) and the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod. Personal life Buswell married Helen (n√©e Spaulding) in 1918 and together they had four children, Jane, James, Jr., Ruth, and John.

The district is coterminous with the Buvuma Islands archipelago in Lake Victoria and does not have territory on mainland Uganda. Location Buvuma District is bordered by Jinja District to the north, Mayuge District to the east, Tanzania to the south, and Buikwe District to the west and northwest. Kitamilo, the district headquarters, is approximately south of the city of Jinja, the nearest large metropolitan area. Overview Buvuma District is made up of 52 scattered islands in the northern part of Lake Victoria. The largest island is called Buvuma, the name adopted by the new district, which was created by Act of Parliament on 1 July 2010. Before that, it was part of Mukono District. Administratively, the district is subdivided into nine administrative units: # Bugaya Sub-county # Busamuzi Sub-county # Bweema Sub-county # Nairambi Sub- county # Buvuma Town Council # Buwooya Sub-County # Lwajje Sub-County # Lubya Sub-county # Lyabaana Sub-county Population In 1991, the national population census estimated the population of the district at 18,500. During the 2002 national census, the population of Buvuma District was estimated at 42,500. In the 2014 National Population and Housing Census, the population stood at 89,890. Economic activities Women gathering and collecting charcoal from kilns for home use. The four main activities in the district are: (a) Fishing (b) Tourism (c) Logging and (d) Manufacture of charcoal. Subsistence agriculture is practiced by the inhabitants of the islands. The majority of the islanders depend a lot on fishing. Overfishing is a concern. The district has twenty-six gazetted forest reserves, although many are threatened by unregulated logging and burning to make charcoal. Little livestock farming is practiced in the district, with the majority of livestock consumed locally in the district.

Biography Qazi Syed Inayatullah was a scholar of Fiqh, an expert in sharia laws, from Sakras, Ferozepur Jhirka, District Mewat (earlier Gurgaon), Haryana. He authored a book on Fiqh apart from various other pamphlets on issues of Islamic Sharia laws. His personality was so profound that his name was remembered as \\"Profound man\\" in any ceremonial occasions by every Mirasi while reading family tree of Sadaat-i Sakras. During the riots of 1947, where other important assets were lost, the family tree of Sadaat-i Sakras was also lost. The family Mirasi of Qazi Syed Inayatullah died in Pakistan, who knew the names of all his descendants till Ali. The only available family tree of ‚ÄòSadaat-i Sakras‚Äô owed the genealogy of Alvi family (descendant of Shah Maroof Ghazi ‚Äì the uncle of Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud). Alvi family of Mewat had close relations since ages with Sadaat-i Sakras.Shajra Miratun Nisab, Edited by Ghulam Mansoor, Shawwal 1276 AH / 1859 ADShajra Miratun Nisab, Edited by Ghulam Mohammad, 1202 AH / 1787 AD His copies of many judgments as Islamic lawyer were preserved in the Library of Hakim Syed Karam Husain at Tijara, Alwar.

Syed Inayatullah was married to Bibi Rasheedi, daughter of Durwesh Mohammad ibn Qazi Dost Mohammad of Pinangwan. One son, Qazi Syed Hayatullah and one daughter Bibi Ruqaiya was born. Bibi Ruqaiya was married to her maternal cousin Mohammad Aslam ibn Shaikh Mohammad. This family produced many noblemen in the kingdom of Mughals. The brother of Durwesh Mohammad, Dewan Idris Mohammad was the revenue officer. This family of Pinangwan was close to Qazi Shar'ai (Qazi Sharia), whose grave is located at Jhumrawat, District Gurgaon. The other daughter of Durwesh Mohammad, Hafizi, was the second wife of Shaikh Mohammad of Khilora. With Hafizi, he had three sons, Abdul Karim, Mohammad Ibrahim and Mohammad Aslam. Shaikh Mohammad was earlier married to Raj Bibi, daughter of Qazi Ibrahim of Tijara. Qazi Ibrahim was the son of Qazi Mahmood. The son of Qazi Ibrahim, Qazi Abdul Baqi was married to Bibi Rabiya, daughter of Qazi Dost Mohammad and the sister of Dewan Idris Mohammad. : HƒÅkim-e Shariah Shareef Qazi-e Aazam ibn Qazi Ziauddin of Pinangwan was 'Qazi Qadaa' (authority to appoint Qazi).

His brother Mohammad Hashim, his son Abdul Hafeez and grandson Ghulam Naqsh Band had also received many Firman (decree) like Qazi Mahmood. Qazi Ibrahim son of Qazi Mahmood was also 'Qazi Qadaa' at Tijara. Shahjahan awarded him Firman (decree) first on 22 Dhu al-Hijjah 1054 AH (Juloos 18) and second on 19 Ramadan 1055 AH. Some parts of his ruined haveli is still seen at Tijara. He died on 5 Moharram 1074 AH / 1665 AD. Qazi Abdul Baqi son of Qazi Ibrahim had also close relations with the Durbar of Aurangzeb and had given him charge of appointing 'Qazi' at Tijara. As per the Firman (decree) of Aurangzeb sealed by ‚ÄòSadr Sadoor Abid Khan‚Äô, he was awarded Sanad of Qadaa. He also built various orchards and Havelis like Haveli Kalan, Deewan Khana, Kothi Bagh etc at Tijara. He had business of horses from Arabian breed. The main gates at the Qazi Mohallah were built by him. In the archive of Tahsil Tijara, dated 1070 AH shows the ‚ÄòMafi Bagh‚Äô in the name of Qazi Abdul Baqi.

The whole city was ravaged. Arrangement to bury the dead bodies could not be made. The young son of Qazi Mohammad Mah, Mohammad Ata was detained with other family members inside the fort of Gogulgarh and could not come out. By chance, from the same route, Mohammad Saleh ibn Mohammad Sultan Khan, was returning from Ziyarat Khwaja Buzurg Ajmeri of Quds Sarah and informed about the incident in Tijara. The relatives from Tijara went to Rewari secretly and brought the dead bodies of Qazi Mohammad Mah and his son Qazi Mohammad Aman (also entitled 'Khan').

Borate esters are volatile and can be purified by distillation. This procedure is used for analysis of trace amounts of borate and for analysis of boron in steel. Like all boron compounds, alkyl borates burn with a characteristic green flame. This property is used to determine the presence of boron in qualitative analysis. Trimethyl borate is a popular borate ester used in organic synthesis. Borate esters form spontaneously when treated with diols such as sugars and the reaction with mannitol forms the basis of a titrimetric analytical method for boric acid. Metaborate esters show considerable Lewis acidity and can initiate epoxide polymerization reactions.M.A. Beckett, G.C. Strickland, J.R. Holland, and K.S.

According to Principal Peter Johnstone \\"Alan was appalled to see so many children come from bookless homes.\\" Following a meeting with philanthropist Christine Fernyhough in 1994 the Alan Duff Charitable Foundation was legally formed. The official launch of the programme (then known as Books in Homes) took place at Tairangi School in Wellington on 24 August 1995 and was attended by then Prime Minister Jim Bolger. The programme began with 80 schools, 16,000 students and 14 sponsors. In 2020 the programme reported almost 510 schools, over 200 Early Childhood Centres, over 100,000 students and more than 200 funding partners and supporters. In 2019 the programme celebrated its 25th year and 13 millionth gifted book with respective events at Government House with Governor-General of New Zealand Dame Patsy Reddy and New Zealand Parliament with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

Operations The programme has a stated aim of inspiring \\"a love of books in Duffy children so they become adults who inspire a love of reading.\\" Its core function is as a form of book club in which students at low decile primary and intermediate schools in New Zealand order books from a brochure which are then presented at role model assemblies at the end of three school terms. Each child participating receives a minimum of five new books each year. Additional components of the programme include annual awards for parents and grandparents, effort in reading and writing and excellence in attitude. There are also weekly book awards for good behaviour. Two troupes of performers visit the majority of schools in the programme annually to perform a literacy-focused stage show. In 2020 the Duffy Theatre performs a show entitled 'Duffy Meets a Coggen'. The programme is also offered to early childhood education centres under the name 'Ready 4 Reading'. Funding Duff stipulated that schools bear some of the cost of funding the programme themselves. Schools fund approximately one third of the cost of the programme with the remaining costs being met by the New Zealand Government and private sponsorship. Major supporters include Mainfreight, Scholastic, Ernst & Young, Carter Holt Harvey, Rotary, Latitude Financial Services and The Warehouse. Results Research undertaken in 1996 and 1997 by Dr Warwick Elley suggested that year 5 and 6 children in eight schools \\"improved (their reading ability) by 35% more than they would have without the Duffy Programme.\\"  References   External links  * New Zealand Herald article Educational charities Educational foundations Children's charities based in New Zealand ","title":"Duffy Books in Homes"},{"id":"30042923","text":"Walter DeWitt \\"Octy\\" Graham (January 23, 1885 - July 14, 1927) was an American football player. He played for the University of Michigan from 1904 to 1907 and was one of the leading players on the famed \\"Point-a-Minute\\" teams of 1904 and 1905. Early years A native of Chicago, Graham attended the English High and Manual Training School and the North Division High School. In 1901, the Chicago Daily Tribune reported that a \\"young Hercules\\" had been discovered in a Chicago high school: > \\"HIGH SCHOOL BOY A MARVEL OF STRENGTH. > Walter D. Graham is the young Hercules in strength discovered among the > Chicago high school boys who aspire to become heroes of the gridiron. ... > Medical inspectors of the Board of Education had been making physical > examinations of ambitious punters to see whether their constitutions were > rugged enough to withstand the vigorous tactics of football.

University of Michigan Graham as a freshman at Michigan, 1904 After graduating from high school, Graham enrolled at the University of Michigan. He played at the guard and tackle positions for the Michigan Wolverines football from 1904 to 1907. He was known by the nickname \\"Octy\\" due to his having a long reach like an octopus. After he scored three touchdowns in a 1905 game, the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote: > \\"'Octy' Graham was allowed to carry the ball and he scored three touchdowns. > Moreover he carried the ball repeatedly on sprints in which he broke away > from the entire field for several yards. At other times he was down under > punts like a shot out of a gun. The cheering for 'Octy' was prolonged: 'Rah > for Octy, Michigan's Eckersall'\\" Graham also handled kicking duties for Michigan. As a senior in 1907, he kicked two field goals for Michigan's only points in an 8-0 win over Vanderbilt. (Field goals counted for four points under 1907 rules.) After the victory over Vanderbilt, The Washington Post called Graham \\"a tenth of a ton Wolverine star\\" who \\"wins games for Michigan and saves his team from defeat.\\" The New York Times later called Graham \\"one of Michigan's greatest football stars of Yost's famous 'point a minute' eleven.\\" Family and later years Graham was married in October 1911 to Emma Lutilla Freaser at the La Salle Hotel; they took their honeymoon trip to Cuba and Mexico. They had two children, Walter D. Graham Jr., and Virginia Graham. In his draft registration submitted in 1918, Graham stated that he was a resident of Chicago and the President of the Mutual Cigar Co. Graham's first wife died in 1920, and in April 1921, Graham married Hazel Cady Chatterton of River Forest, Illinois. The couple announced their plans to live in Kenilworth. They had four children, Walter D. Graham Jr., William Graham, Virginia Graham, and Jeanne Graham. Graham lived in River Forest in his later years. After developing a brain tumor, he underwent surgery at Chicago's Wesley Memorial Hospital in late May 1927. He showed signs of improvement in the days after the surgery, but he died at his home in River Forest less than two months later.

He considered it for his third album, The Times They Are a-Changin, but only attempted a few takes during the album's first studio session. Dylan's earlier recordings of \\"Farewell\\" found their way onto various bootlegs, and a collection of demos that included the song was released in October 2010 on The Bootleg Series Vol. 9 ‚Äì The Witmark Demos: 1962‚Äì1964. Over the years, \\"Farewell\\" has been recorded by about 20 other musicians worldwide, including Pete Seeger, Judy Collins, Lonnie Donegan, Dion, and Tony Rice. Dylan's recordings Dylan first recorded \\"Farewell\\" on February 8, 1963, along with 11 other songs, during a session that for many years was believed to have taken place in the basement of either Gerde's Folk City or the Gaslight Cafe, Greenwich Village venues where Dylan performed during the early 1960s. His friend Happy Traum, then with The New World Singers, backed him on vocals and banjo. The recordings were eventually bootlegged under the title The Banjo Tape. Decades later, in interviews with author Michael Gray, Traum identified the session's location as the East Village apartment of Gil Turner, who worked at Gerde's and was an editor for the folk music magazine Broadside. A month after the session with Traum, Dylan recorded the song as a demo for his music publisher M. Witmark & Sons. The demo version, which appeared on several bootlegs, was officially released on the Witmark Demos. During the time Dylan was making periodic trips to Witmark's Manhattan studios, between 1962 and 1964, he was also visiting Broadside to tape songs for publication. In April 1963, he recorded \\"Farewell\\" for the magazine, and a transcription of its lyrics and music appeared in that month's issue. Also in April, Dylan went to Chicago to appear at The Bear, a folk music club owned by his manager Albert Grossman. The next day, April 26, he was interviewed during a taping of author Studs Terkel's radio show on WFMT. He played seven songs on the show, opening with \\"Farewell\\" (the seventh was \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\"). Four months later during the first of six Times They Are a-Changin' sessions, Dylan recorded four takes of the song, none of them complete. Only one live recording of the song is known to exist, released on The 50th Anniversary Collection 1963. Dylan played relatively few concerts during 1963. Besides a couple solo dates that year and performances as a \\"surprise guest\\" at several Joan Baez concerts, he made appearances at the Brandeis Folk Festival in Massachusetts, Monterey Folk Festival in California and Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island. He began touring in earnest the next year, both solo performances and a series of concert dates co-billed with Baez. \\"Farewell\\" does not appear on the setlists from either year's concerts. A shorter, previously unreleased studio version of the song was released on the soundtrack of the Coen brothers' 2013 film Inside Llewyn Davishttp://musicbrainz.org/release/1985c4fe-6ebc-4bbe-8528-9e3e8727e26f (although the \\"Witmark Demos\\" version was used in the actual film). Song's origin and meaning Dylan based the song on the traditional British folk ballad \\"Leaving of Liverpool\\". He first played it for friends in Greenwich Village after returning from a two-week trip to London in early January 1963. In \\"Leaving of Liverpool\\", the ballad's first verse and chorus tell the tale of someone sailing from Liverpool to California, bound to miss the loved one left behind: The opening lyrics in Dylan's song are very similar: Obvious similarities aside, the story and sentiments of the two songs differ. In \\"The Leaving of Liverpool\\", the narrator is bound for California by sea and promises to return. In \\"Farewell\\", the narrator mentions traveling by highway and trail, with California as one of two possible destinations, neither of them definite. As Dylan's narrator says, \\"I'm ramblin'...unnoticed and unknown.\\" While indicating they will \\"meet another day, another time\\", the traveler promises only to think of his loved one and write from \\"time to time\\", without any mention of returning. Recordings by other artists In 1963, folk singer Pete Seeger, who was closely associated with Broadside, recorded \\"Farewell\\" for The Broadside Ballads, Volume 2, a collection of songs Seeger selected from the pages of the magazine. Seeger's version was issued as \\"Fare-Thee-Well (My Own True Love)\\", the title from the published transcription. Judy Collins recorded it along with \\"Masters of War\\" for Judy Collins 3 as the first of many Dylan songs she would do over the next four decades. The Hillmen also recorded the song in 1963 for their eponymous first album under the simpler title \\"Fare Thee Well\\". The group featured Chris Hillman, a mandolin player who the next year switched to electric bass to become a founding member of The Byrds. Two recordings of \\"Farewell\\" were issued in 1964 using the simpler title from Dylan's Times They Are a-Changin' setlist, \\"Farewell\\". Anita and Helen Carter from the famed traditional folk group The Carter Family recorded it for their self-titled album. The Modern Folk Quartet also put out a version on the album Changes. One of the quartet's singers was Tim Buckley, who would later be hailed as \\"one of the great rock vocalists of the 1960s\\". In 1965, The Kingston Trio, who six years before led the way in establishing folk as a commercial genre, recorded \\"Farewell\\" for Nick Bob John, listing it under both titles, \\"Farewell (Fare Thee Well)\\". British skiffle musician Lonnie Donegan on The Folk Album, also released a version of the song in 1965. Four years later, Dion DiMucci, leader of rock 'n roll's Dion and the Belmonts, issued a solo folk rock album, Wonder Where I'm Bound. The album, produced by Tom Wilson, who worked with Dylan on Bringing It All Back Home, included two Dylan songs, \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\" and \\"Farewell\\". Other notable releases of \\"Farewell\\" in later years included Greek singer Nana Mouskouri's version on her album Turn on the Sun, released in 1970, Irish folk singer Liam Clancy's version on 1975's Farewell To Tarwaithie and on 1982's The Dutchman and bluegrass musician Tony Rice's on 1984's Cold on the Shoulder.

This design is usually used in place of, or in some cases in conjunction with, the within-subject design, which applies the same variations of conditions to each subject to observe the reactions. The simplest between-group design occurs with two groups; one is generally regarded as the treatment group, which receives the ‚Äòspecial‚Äô treatment, (that is, is treated with some variable) and the control group, which receives no variable treatment and is used as a reference (prove that any deviation in results from the treatment group is, indeed, a direct result of the variable.) The between-group design is widely used in psychological, economic, and sociological experiments, as well as in several other fields in the natural or social sciences. Experimental blinds In order to avoid experimental bias, experimental blinds are usually applied in between-group designs. The most commonly used type is the single blind, which keeps the subjects blind without identifying them as members of the treatment group or the control group. In a single-blind experiment, a placebo is usually offered to the control group members. Occasionally, the double blind, a more secure way to avoid bias from both the subjects and the testers, is implemented. In this case, both the subjects and the testers are unaware of which group subjects belong to. The double blind design can protect the experiment from the observer-expectancy effect. Advantages The utilization of the between-group experimental design has several advantages. First, multiple variables, or multiple levels of a variable, can be tested simultaneously, and with enough testing subjects, a large number can be tested. Thus, the inquiry is broadened and extended beyond the effect of one variable (as with within-subject design). Additionally, this design saves a great deal of time, which is ideal if the results aid in a time-sensitive issue, such as healthcare. Disadvantages The main disadvantage with between-group designs is that they can be complex and often require a large number of participants to generate any useful and reliable data. For example, researchers testing the effectiveness of a treatment for severe depression might need two groups of twenty patients for a control and a test group. If they wanted to add another treatment to the research, they would need another group of twenty patients. The potential scale of these experiments can make between-group designs impractical due to limited resources, subjects and space. Another major concern for between-group designs is bias. Assignment bias, observer-expectancy and subject-expectancy biases are common causes for skewed data results in between-group experiments, which can lead to false conclusions being drawn. These problems can be prevented by implementing random assignment and creating double-blind experiments whereby both the subject and experimenter are kept blind about the hypothesized effects of the experiment. Some other disadvantages for between-group designs are generalization, individual variability and environmental factors. Whilst it is easy to try to select subjects of the same age, gender and background, this may lead to generalization issues, as you cannot then extrapolate the results to include wider groups. At the same time, the lack of homogeneity within a group due to individual variability may also produce unreliable results and obscure genuine patterns and trends. Environmental variables can also influence results and usually arise from poor research design. Practice effect A practice effect is the outcome/performance change resulting from repeated testing. This is best described by the Power Law of Practice: If multiple levels or some other variable variation are tested repeatedly (which is the case in between-group experiments), the subjects within each sub-group become more familiarized with testing conditions, thus increasing responsiveness and performance. Mixed factorial design Some research has been done regarding whether it is possible to design an experiment that combines within-subject design and between-group design, or if they are distinct methods. A way to design psychological experiments using both designs exists and is sometimes known as \\"mixed factorial design\\".Hall, Richard. \\"2x2 Mixed Factorial Design.\\" Psychology World. 1998. Web. 13 Dec. 2010. In this design setup, there are multiple variables, some classified as within-subject variables, and some classified as between-group variables. One example study combined both variables. This enabled the experimenter to analyze reasons for depression among specific individuals through the within-subject variable, and also determine the effectiveness of the two treatment options through a comparison of the between-group variable: Another example tests 15 men and 15 women, and examines participants' tasting of ice cream flavors: The above example is between-group, as no participants can be part of both the male group and female group. It is also within-subjects, because each participant tasted all four flavors of ice cream provided. References Further reading * \\"Learning Objectives.\\" Research Methods in Psychology. 6th.

The mandate was to review management structures and cost-effectiveness, but did not include curriculum, teaching or effectiveness. The Government largely accepted the recommendations, with legislation giving effect to a new era in education coming into force on 1 October 1989. Membership The members of the task force were: Brian Picot, a businessman, Peter Ramsay, an associate professor of education at the University of Waikato, Margaret Rosemergy, a senior lecturer at the Wellington College of Education, Whetumarama Wereta, a social researcher at the Department of Maori Affairs and Colin Wise, another businessman. The task force was assisted by staff from the Treasury and the State Services Commission (SSC), who may have applied pressure on the task force to move towards eventually privatizing education, as had happened with other government services. The mandate was to review management structures and cost-effectiveness, but did not include curriculum, teaching or effectiveness. In nine months the commission received input from over 700 people or organizations. Administering for Excellence The Picot task force released its report Administering for Excellence: Effective Administration in Education in May 1988. The report was critical of the Department of Education, which it labelled as inefficient and unresponsive. It recommended a system where each school would be largely independent, governed by a board consisting mainly of parents, although subject to review and inspection by specialized government agencies. The government accepted many of the recommendations in their response Tomorrow's Schools - which became the basis for educational reform in New Zealand starting in 1989. However, not all recommendations survived. The concept of a coordinating Education Policy Council was dropped. The Picot task force conceived of the school charter as a contract between school boards, the local community and central authority. After a review by the SSC, the boards of trustees were made responsible to the Minister of Education, who gained the power to dismiss boards. The recommendation of the task force to provide funding to the boards for payment of salaries, rather than have teachers paid by the government, was rejected at first. Later reintroduced on a voluntary trial basis, the concept of paying salaries out of block grants was rejected by most boards.

He was elected to represent the riding of Victoria-Hillside in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in 1983, 1986 and 1991. He served in the Cabinet of Mike Harcourt as Minister of Municipal Affairs, Minister of Government Services and the Minister Responsible for Sport and the Commonwealth Games. He was forced out of office due to a number of sexual harassment complaints, which resulted in Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), a leading Supreme Court of Canada decision on the scope of section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and on the administrative law principle of natural justice. Due to delays to the tribunal hearings the claims were not resolved for 30 months after the first filing in 1995. During this time Blencoe was subjected to vast media coverage that led to the end of his political career, and contributed to his and his family's social and psychological hardship. The Supreme Court of Canada rejected Blencoe's argument that the delay warranted a stay of the human rights complaint. Following this decision, the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal issued its decision on the original sexual harassment complaint. The Tribunal found that Mr. Blencoe had engaged in conduct towards an employee which was sexual in nature and unwelcome, and that this conduct had a negative work- related impact on the employee. The Tribunal issued a declaration that Mr. Blencoe not engage in similar activity in the future an ordered that he pay $5000 to the former employee.

Costco Wholesale Corp., 541 F.3d 982 (9th Cir. 2008), was a case decided by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that held that in copyright law, the first-sale doctrine does not act as a defense to claims of infringing distribution and importation for unauthorized sale of authentic, imported watches that bore a design registered in the Copyright Office. It carried no precedential weight, and is contrasted with Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.. Factual background The plaintiff, Omega SA, is a luxury watchmaker based in Switzerland that distributes its watches through authorized retailers. The Omega watches feature a copyrighted globe design on the back of the watch. The defendant Costco obtained the watches through the gray market: Omega would sell the watches to authorized distributors, third parties would buy the watches and sell them to the New York state company ENE Limited, and ENE would sell the watches to Costco. Omega did not authorize the importation or resale in the United States, and Omega sued for copyright infringement under 17 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 106(3) and 602(a). Costco asserted that the first-sale doctrine precluded any infringement claims against them. The trial court ruled in favor of Costco.Omega, 541 F.3d at 984. Ninth Circuit decision The Ninth Circuit reversed the trial court. The court cited Ninth Circuit precedents that interpreted the first-sale doctrine as applying only to goods made in the United States.Omega, 541 F.3d at 986. The court found its interpretation to be consistent with the Supreme Court case Quality King v. L'anza, which held that the first-sale doctrine was a defense to an infringement claim based on unauthorized importation of copyrighted materials made within the United States.Omega, 541 F.3d at 987. The court noted that the first-sale doctrine only covered the resale of copies obtained lawfully, and declined to apply the Copyright Act extraterritorially and ascribe lawfulness to copies made outside of the United States. Because the Omega watches at issue were made outside of the United States, the court held that the first- sale doctrine could not act as a defense and that Costco was liable for infringing Omega's importation rights. Supreme Court case Certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was granted on April 19, 2010.Supreme Court Docket File, No. 08-1423 Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of the case. She was the Solicitor General before the case came to the Supreme Court. The remaining Justices split 4‚Äì4, which means the Court affirms the Ninth Circuit's decision.. Subsequent history On remand to the district court, both Costco and Omega moved for summary judgment on the issue of copyright misuse. Judge Terry Hatter found for Costco, holding that Omega's application of a copyrighted work to an uncopyrighted watch for the purpose of controlling importation of the uncopyrighted good constituted copyright misuse.Omega S.A. v. Costco Wholesale Corp., no. 04-05443, (E.D. Cal. Nov. 9. 2011), order. (\\"Here, Omega concedes that a purpose of the copyrighted Omega Globe Design was to control the importation and sale of its watches containing the design, as the watches could not be copyrighted. Accordingly, Omega misused its copyright of the Omega Globe Design by leveraging its limited monopoly in being able to control the importation of that design to control the importation of its Seamaster watches.\\") Retrieved April 12, 2012. On January 20, 2015, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court judgment, including awarding attorney's fees to Costco. Impact The decision has been characterized as a loss for consumers in the sense that manufacturers will better be able to control the prices of their goods when the grey market cannot serve as competition. Also, the distinction drawn in the case between goods manufactured inside the United States and goods manufactured outside could be a possible motivation for companies to locate their manufacturing outside of the United States, where the first-sale doctrine would not stand as an obstacle to suing grey market importers.Field, Abigail. Supreme Court Rules Against Consumers in Costco vs. Omega. Daily Finance, 13 December 2010. As a 4‚Äì4 decision, however, Omega only operates as mandatory authority in the Ninth Circuit and does not set a nationwide precedent. In December 2011, petitions for certiorari in two cases from the Second Circuit with a similar issue were filed in the Supreme Court, providing the Court with another opportunity to revisit the still-unresolved issue in Omega: Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., no. 11-697, petition for certiorari (docket). December 5, 2011. Retrieved April 12, 2012. and Liu v. Pearson EducationLiu v. Pearson Education, Inc., et al., no. 11-708, petition for certiorari (docket). December 8, 2011. Retrieved April 12, 2012. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed lower court rulings and ruled that Kirtsaeng's sale of lawfully-made copies purchased overseas was protected by the first-sale doctrine. Liu and another Pearson case were subsequently remanded to the lower courts to rehear, in light of Kirtsaeng.

USS Satilla (SP-687) was a United States Navy patrol vessel in commission from 1917 to 1919. Construction and acquisition Satilla was built as a private steam yacht of the same name by George Lawley & Son at Neponset, Massachusetts, in 1902. After the death of her owner, R. Hall McCormick of Chicago, Illinois, the State of Maine purchased her from McCormick's estate in May 1917 for the local use of the section patrol commander at Rockland, Maine. On 17 May 1917, the U.S. Navy purchased Satilla from the State of Maine for use as a section patrol boat during World War I. She began operating with the Maine Naval Militia on 24 May 1917, patrolling the Maine coast. The Navy commissioned her as USS Saltilla (SP-687) on 31 May 1917 with Ensign Roswell F. Eaton, USNRF, in command, and she was enrolled in the Naval Coast Defense Reserve on 18 June 1917. U.S. Navy service Satilla carried out patrol duties off Rockland and Bath, Maine, for the rest of World War I, frequently lying to overnight at Cross Island, Winter Harbor, and Cutler Harbor. On 1 September 1917, she served as one of the escorts for the new destroyer USS Manley (Destroyer No. 74) during Manleys sea trials off Bath. While lying alongside the Hodge Boiler Works pier at Boston in mid-1918, Satilla was accidentally rammed by the minesweeper and suffered considerable damage. Although her hull was buckled in on the port side and leaking, she was repaired over the next few months and returned to duty, although not until after the end of World War I. Disposal and later career Satilla steamed to Boston, Massachusetts, on 19 September 1919, where she was placed in the custody of the Commandant, 1st Naval District. Stricken from the Navy List on 7 November 1919, Satilla was sold on 25 March 1920 to Oscar L. Ledberg of Providence, Rhode Island. Ledberg renamed her Edith, and used her as a yacht until 1927, when he sold her to Captain William Baletti of Hoboken, New Jersey. Baletti employed her thereafter as a fishing boat.

Biography Wilson was born in Perthshire, Scotland. At an early age he was imbued with a passionate love of poetry, derived from his mother, who sang the Jacobite songs and ballads of her native land. While a boy he lost his father, the merchant's death being preceded by his failure in business. A bachelor uncle's fortune in Jamaica was in some way lost to his brother's children, for whom it was intended, so that Wilson's early life was accompanied by many deprivations, including the completion of his education. At 22, he became the editor of the Dundee Literary Olio, a large proportion of which he wrote, in both prose and verse. By 1826, Wilson had married and moved with his wife to Edinburgh at the urging of influential friends; he became established in business, and joined the literary circle of Christopher North. That same year his young wife died, and he expressed his sorrow in poetry. In 1830, Wilson married Miss Sibbald, of Borthaugh, a descendant of Sir Andrew Sibbald and a niece of James Sibbald, the literary antiquary and editor of the Chronicle of Scottish Poetry, also the friend of Robert Burns. They had three sons together. Wilson published poems in the Edinburgh Literary Journal and other leading periodicals. At this period, the young poet's charming conversation and manners made him a welcome guest in the literary circles of Edinburgh. At the house of Mrs. Anne Grant, of Loch Laggan, he was a constant visitor, and she owned his portrait by Sir John Watson Gordon. When 32 years of age, Wilson and his wife emigrated to the United States and settled at Poughkeepsie, New York, on the Hudson River. He was a bookseller and publisher, which he continued till his death, a portion of the time in partnership with the elder brother of Bishops Alonzo and Horatio Potter, and later with his son, James Grant. Wilson occasionally contributed in prose and verse ‚Äî generally anonymously ‚Äî to various American periodicals. Sometimes he sent contributions to the British Blackwood or Chambers's Journal. Selections of his poems appeared in The Cabinet, Modern Scottish Minstrel, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Poems of Places, but he never issued them in a volume. Wilson died in Poughkeepsie. It was not till 1869 that a portion of his poems were published in Poughkeepsie with a memoir by Benson J. Lossing. A second edition, with additional poems, appeared in 1875, and a third in 1884. Willis pronounced one of Wilson's poems \\"the best modern imitation of the old ballad style that he had ever met with,\\" and William Cullen Bryant said \\"the song in which the writer personates Richard the Lion-hearted during his imprisonment is more spirited than any of the ballads of Aytoun.\\" All of Wilson's sons by his second marriage served in the Civil War: James attained the rank of brevet brigadier general; the second fell at the head of his company at Fredericksburg, Virginia; and the youngest, leaving his studies at 16, volunteered with several of his classmates and went to the front.

First formally described in 1803, it was given its current name in 1872. Widely distributed, it is common in Europe and North America, and has also been collected in North Africa, Central America, and Japan. The fungus is saprobic, and produces fruit bodies (mushrooms) that grow on the floor of coniferous forests. The mushrooms have a bell-shaped to conical cap up to in diameter, set atop a slender stipe up to long with yellow to orange hairs at the base. The fungus is named after its characteristic bright orange gill edges. A microscopic characteristic is the club-shaped cystidia that are covered with numerous spiky projections, resembling a mace. The edibility of the mushroom has not been determined. M. aurantiomarginata can be distinguished from similar Mycena species by differences in size, color, and substrate. A 2010 publication reported the discovery and characterization of a novel pigment named mycenaaurin A, isolated from the mushroom. The pigment is responsible for its color, and it has antibiotic activity that may function to prevent certain bacteria from growing on the mushroom. Taxonomy The species, originally named Agaricus marginatus by the Danish naturalist Heinrich Christian Friedrich Schumacher in 1803, has several synonyms. Elias Magnus Fries renamed it Agaricus aurantio- marginatus in his 1821 Systema Mycologicum, while Christiaan Hendrik Persoon called it Agaricus schumacheri in 1828. Although Schumacher had the earliest publication date, Fries's name is sanctioned, and so the specific epithet he used is given nomenclatural precedence. French mycologist Lucien Qu√©let transferred the species to the genus Mycena in 1872. In 1930 Karel Cejp considered it to be a variety of Mycena elegans. According to Alexander H. Smith's organization of the genus Mycena, M. aurantiomarginata is classified in section Calodontes, subsection Granulatae, which contains species with roughened cheilocystidia (cystidia on gill edges), such as M. rosella, M. flavescens, M. elegans, and M. strobilinoides.Smith (1947), p. 196. In his 1992 study of Mycena, Dutch mycologist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus put M. aurantiomarginata in the section Luculentae, characterized by species with an olive to yellowish-olive and moist cap, pallid to gray-olive gills with bright orange margins, brownish to grayish-olive stipes, white spore deposit, and spiny cystidia. M. aurantiomarginata was included in a 2010 molecular analysis focused on clarifying the phylogenetic relationships between Northern European species in the section Calodontes. The results suggested that, based on the similarity of nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences, the fungus is closely related to M. crocata and M. leaiana. This conclusion was previously corroborated by research that used molecular analysis to demonstrate that several Mycena species can be mycorrhizal partners of the orchid Gastrodia confusa. The specific epithet aurantiomarginata is Latin, and refers to the orange edges of its gills (aurantius, \\"orange\\"; marginata, \\"bordered\\"). In the United Kingdom, the mushroom is commonly known as the \\"golden-edge bonnet\\". Description The cap of M. aurantiomarginata ranges in shape from obtusely conic to bell-shaped, and becomes flat in maturity, reaching diameters of . The cap color is variable, ranging from dark olive fuscous (dark brownish- gray) to yellowish-olive in the center, while the margin is orangish. Alexander H. Smith, in his 1947 monograph of North American Mycena species, stated that the caps are not hygrophanous (changing color depending on the level of hydration),Smith (1947), pp. 198‚Äì9. while Mycena specialist Arne Aronsen says they are. The overall color fades as the mushroom ages. The surface is moist, and young individuals are covered with fine whitish powder, but this soon sloughs off to leave a polished surface that develops radial grooves in maturity. The flesh is thin (about 1 mm thick in the center of the cap) and flexible. Gills are adnate with a decurrent tooth (where the gills curve up to join the stipe but then, close to the stipe, the margin turns down again), and initially narrow but broaden when old. They are pallid to grayish- olive with bright orange edges. Smith noted that the edge color may spread to the gill faces in some specimens, because the pigment, rather than being encrusted on the walls of the cystidia, is found in the cytosol and therefore more readily diffusible. The gills are spaced close together, with between 16 and 26 gills reaching the stipe, and there are up to three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stipe). The cylindrical stipe is long by thick, hollow, and stiff but flexible; it is somewhat thicker at the base. It has a brownish to grayish-olive color that is sometimes tinged with shades of orange. The surface is smooth except for orange powder near the top, while the base is covered with stiff orange hairs. Smith reports the mushroom tissue to have no distinctive taste or odor, while Aronsen says the odor is \\"very conspicuous; sweet, fruity, often experienced as farinaceous or faintly of anise\\". Like many small Mycena species, the edibility of the mushroom is unknown, as it is too insubstantial to consider collecting for the table. The cystidia are club- shaped and spiny. The spores are elliptic, smooth, and amyloid, with dimensions of 7‚Äì9 by 4‚Äì5 Œºm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells of the hymenium) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25‚Äì32 by 5.5‚Äì7 Œºm. Pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces and edges, respectively) are abundant and similar in morphology: club-shaped to somewhat capitate (with a head), the tops sparsely to densely covered with small spines (said to resemble a mace), filled with a bright orange pigment, and measuring 28‚Äì36 by 7‚Äì12 Œºm. The flesh of the cap is covered with a cuticle, on the surface of which are found scattered cystidia similar to those on the gills. Directly beneath the cuticle is a layer of enlarged cells, and beneath this are filamentous hyphae. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae. Mycena aurantiomarginata uses a tetrapolar mating system, whereby genes at two different locations on the chromosomes regulate sexual compatibility, or mating type. This system prevents self-fertilization and ensures a high degree of genotypic diversity. When the fungal mycelia is grown in culture on a petri dish, the colonies are white, odorless, and typically have a central patch of congested aerial hyphae that grow upward from the colony surface, which abruptly become flattened to submerged, and occasionally form faint zone lines. The hyphae commonly form deposits of tiny amorphous crystals where they contact other mycelial fronts, especially where the hyphae are vegetatively incompatible and destroy each other by lysis. Similar species The bright orange Mycena leaiana grows in clusters on rotting wood. Mycena aurantiomarginata is generally recognizable in the field by its olive-brown to orangish cap, bright orange gill edges, and yellowish hairs at the base of the stipe. M. elegans is similar in appearance to M. aurantiomarginata, and some have considered them synonymous. M. elegans is larger, with a cap diameter up to and stipe length up to , darker, and has pale greenish-yellow colors on the gill edges and stipes that stain dull reddish-brown in age.Smith (1947), p. 202. M. leaiana is readily distinguished from M. aurantiomarginata by the bright orange color of its fruit bodies, its clustered growth on rotting wood, and the presence of a gelatinous layer on its stipe.Smith (1947), p. 413. M. strobilinoides closely resembles M. aurantiomarginata in shape, size, spore morphology, and the presence of hairs at the stipe base. It has a cap color that ranges from scarlet to yellow, and features scarlet edges on widely spaced, pale pinkish-orange to yellow gills. Habitat and distribution Mycena aurantiomarginata is a saprobic fungus, deriving nutrients from decomposing organic matter found on the forest floor, such as needle carpets. Fruit bodies of the fungus grow scattered, in groups, or in tufts under conifers (usually spruce and fir), and are often found on moss. In North America, it is found in California, Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia, and the species is widely distributed in western and northern Europe. In Central America, the mushroom has been collected on the summit of Cerro de la Muerte in the Cordillera de Talamanca, Costa Rica, on leaf litter of Comarostaphylis arbutoides (a highly branched evergreen shrub or tree in the heath family). In 2010, it was reported from Hokkaido in northern Japan, where it was found growing on Picea glehnii forest litter in early winter. It has also been recorded from North Africa. Bioactive compounds Mycenaaurin A In 2010, a pigment compound isolated and characterized from fruit bodies of Mycena aurantiomarginata was reported as new to science by Robert Jaeger and Peter Spiteller in the Journal of Natural Products. The chemical, mycenaaurin A, is a polyene compound that consists of a tridecaketide (i.e., 13 adjacent methylene bridge and carbonyl functional groups with two amino acid moieties on either end of the molecule). The authors posit that the flanking amino acid groups are probably derived biosynthetically from S-Adenosyl methionine. The tridecaketide itself contains an alpha-pyrone, a conjugated hexaene, and a single alkenyl moiety. Jaeger and Spiteller suggest that mycenaaurin A might function as a defense compound, since it exhibits antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus pumilus. The chemical is only present in the fruit bodies, and not in the colorless mycelia. An earlier screening for antimicrobial activity in the fruit bodies revealed a weak ability to inhibit the growth of the fungi Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus.

The channel launched on 29 June 1997 as TV4 and was replaced by C4 on 3 October 2003. It was relaunched on 6 February 2011 as a separate channel from C4. On 2 July 2016, Mediaworks closed FOUR and replaced it with Bravo as part of a deal with NBC Universal. In general, the channel's target audience was 18- to 49-year-olds and could be broader in its appeal, with programming which attracted a wider, and more mature audience. During early mornings and late afternoons the channel screened a range of children's programming such as Sesame Street and in the evenings screened shows aimed at the mainstream audience. Overnight and late mornings ‚Äì early afternoons the channel screened Infomercials and Auto TV (Car Commercials). Four broadcast mostly American programming, with the exception of Sticky TV, Four Live, and Smash, which were in-house produced Auckland-hosted youth shows, and the Pukana youth show, which was produced from a Maori language government fund. Pukana also airs on one of the two government funded Maori language channels. History Previous TV4 logo used from 1997 to 2003 The history of Four dates back to 1997 when TV3 decided to launch a second channel, TV4. TV4 was an entertainment network and screened a wide range of imported shows such as South Park, Beverly Hills 90210, Beavis and Butthead. After 2000, new programming was scarce, with the infiltration of 1980's and 1990s repeats. In 2003, TV4 was replaced by music channel C4. On 6 February 2011, TV4 returned as Four. MediaWorks announced this in October 2010, and said that the new network would focus on children's programming during the day and in the evenings will screen a range of shows aimed at the 18- to 49-year- old audience. The first programme to air on Four was The Simpsons episode \\"Elementary School Musical\\" (not coincidentally featuring New Zealand band Flight of the Conchords). At the end of 2012, Four began screening some new episodes of shows within seven days of the show being broadcasting in the United States under the Fast Four brand. Examples of shows include The Simpsons, Family Guy, Glee and How I Met Your Mother. New Zealand TV networks typically start screening most US television series around five months after the original release, usually first screening in late January or February at the end of the New Zealand summer, catching up to the US at the end of the season as all 22 episodes are broadcast week-after-week, not spread out over nine months as in the US. The transition of shows like Glee from TV3 to Four also lost the NZ On Air funding that is given to TV3 to get EIA-608 captions converted from source masters to the preferred Teletext format by TVNZ's Access Services. As New Zealand broadcasters are completely reliant on this process for program subtitling. Closure The final show to play on Four was The Biggest Loser. At 10:50pm on Saturday 2 July 2016, the channel closed with Feist singing \\"1234\\" (the same Sesame Street song that was used to relaunch the channel in 2011); the channel then faded to black. Four Plus 1 Four Plus 1 logo Mediaworks launched a timeshift service, Four Plus 1, on 27 June 2014. It was a standard hour delayed timeshift channel of the Four broadcast. Four Plus 1 was initially only available on digital terrestrial with satellite launched a week later on Sky's fifth digital transport. It was replaced by Bravo Plus 1 on 3 July 2016, when Bravo replaced Four.

It is a saga of twin brothers, orphaned by their mother's death at their births and forsaken by their father.Cutting for Stone book info The book includes both a deep description of medical procedures and an exploration of the human side of medical practices. When first published, the novel was on The New York Times Best Seller list for two years and generally received well by critics. With its positive reception, Barack Obama put it on his summer reading list and the book was optioned for adaptations. Plot summary The story is told by the protagonist, Marion Stone. He and his conjoined twin Shiva are born at Mission Hospital (called \\"Missing\\" in accordance with the local pronunciation), Addis Ababa, in September 1954. Their mother, Sister Mary Joseph Praise, an Indian Carmelite nun, dies during childbirth. Their father, Thomas Stone, the English surgeon of Missing, abandons them and disappears. Orphaned at birth, the pair grow up in the household of two physicians of Missing, both from Madras, the obstetrician Kalpana Hemlatha (Hema) and Abhi Ghosh, who fall in love while caring for the infants. Hema names them Marion (after J. Marion Sims) and Shiva (after the Hindu deity). Ghosh teaches himself surgery to replace Stone. The tissue link between the twins has been separated at birth and the two grow up together being very close initially. Both twins are exposed to the changing political environment in Ethiopia. There is an unsuccessful rebellion by Haile Selassie‚Äôs bodyguard, General Mebratu. Ghosh is imprisoned, then released, in the aftermath of the coup, due to his friendship with Mebratu. Through their parents, both boys are exposed to medicine and taught at the hospital. Over time, though, individual differences begin to become pronounced. When entering puberty their relationship to Genet, the daughter of Rosina, a domestic help, finally tears them apart. Marion is in love with Genet and intends to marry her, but it is Shiva who, interested in sexual pursuits, becomes her first lover. Marion feels betrayed. Rosina forces Genet to submit to female genital mutilation and commits suicide shortly thereafter. Genet will later join the Eritrean liberation movement. While Marion goes to medical school, his brother stays at Missing. Focused on the repair of birth-related fistulas, he takes up his surgical training with Hema eschewing a formal medical education. On his death bed, Ghosh has three wishes for Marion - to get the best medical education, to find Stone, and to forgive his brother. When Genet and her comrades hijack an Ethiopian Airlines airplane in 1979, Marion is on a list of her connections. To avoid arrest he flees the country overnight to Kenya. He goes to New York City where he finds a position at Our Lady of Perpetual Succour, a hospital in the Bronx. There, he enters a surgical residency. One day, assisting his senior in a complicated trauma operation, an unknown surgeon enters looking them over the shoulder. It is Thomas Stone, by now a well-renowned liver surgeon from Boston. Marion's encounter with his biological father redirects his life leading to a painful reconciliation and reunion with his estranged brother. Medical topics The book contains descriptions of many medical diseases and interventions. The title relates to the oath of Hippocrates that calls his acolytes not to cut for (bladder) stones. Marion's mother dies during a complicated delivery (conjoined twins) from a uterine rupture. The babies are born premature. Shiva becomes an expert in the repair of vesico-vaginal and recto-vaginal fistulas. A vasectomy is described in detail \\"so charming and surgically precise, it could serve, in a pinch, as a how-to-manual.\\" The surgery of an intestinal volvulus establishes a relationship between Ghosh and Mebratu, but leads to his later imprisonment. Ghosh later dies from leukemia possibly related to his handling of outdated x-ray equipment. Genet undergoes female genital mutilation (female circumcision) and suffers from its complications. The book describes conditions in a tuberculosis sanatorium where Stone's mother dies from a ruptured aneurysm, the underlying condition acquired from her husband who has syphilis, or more specifically, tabes dorsalis. Marion's participation in the setting of an atriocaval shunt (a \\"Shrock\\") during trauma surgery in New York sets the scene when he encounters his biological father. The reader is further confronted with typhoid fever and hepatitis with liver failure. Other topics covered are depression, appendicitis, amputation, rickets, intestinal cancer, phlebitis, and intracranial hemorrhage. Reception By February 2012 the book had been on the bestseller list of the New York Times for more than two years, and over one million copies had been sold. Paula Bock praises the book finding the epic \\"absorbing, exhilarating, and exhausting.\\" Aida Edemariam notes that Verghese \\"interweaves (the characters') story with that of Ethiopia's past half century\\" and likes \\"the variety and colour of Verghese's world, its earthiness and drama, its concreteness and unselfconscious swing.\\" She criticizes \\"a certain brutality ... in the gender politics\\" of the novel and that in real life things do not work out so neatly as narrated. Erica Wagner gives a mixed review finding \\"the novel to be capacious, not to say baggy\\" and \\"tinged, albeit lightly, with a sense of magic\\". While she admires the vivid descriptions of surgery, she suggests that the medical details sometimes interfere with the flow of the story. She criticizes that Verghese attempts \\"to cram in every last fact about (his characters).\\" However, John Irving wrote that \\"I've not read a novel wherein medicine, the practice of it, is made as germane to the storytelling process, to the overall narrative, as the author manages to make it happen here.\\" In 2011, President Barack Obama said he had chosen Cutting for Stone as one of the five books on his summer vacation reading list. In February 2012 it was announced that Susanne Bier has signed on to direct a movie version of Cutting for Stone. Scott Teems will write the screen adaption.

It is the most populous town in Remo Region of the Ikenne Local Government Area. The entire LGA has an area of 137.13 km¬≤ and a population of 178,412 at the 2006 census. Etymology There are many assertions about the name of the town Iperu: The first school of thought i.e. oral African History says Akesan was said to have settled at the present Akesan market where she sold cooked maize. It was said that there was a palm tree that had sunk close-by where she sat to sell her wares, and there was a hole where the palm tree sank, meaning in Yoruba \\" Ibiti ope ti ru\\", the sentence was abridged to \\"Iperu\\".http://www.thenationonlineng.net/archive2/tblnews_Detail.php?id=70969 The second school of thought i.e. oral African History about the name \\"Iperu\\" was that a lot of palm-trees abound around the place where Akesan was selling her cooked maize. The place where there were a lot of palm trees or the place where palm trees flourished meaning in Yoruba \\"Ibi ti ope ru\\". The sentence \\"Ibi ti ope ru\\" was shortened to the word \\"Iperu\\". The third school of thought i.e. oral African history has it that Iperu was an offshoot of Epe in Sagamu. Epe in Sagamu is not a quarter but an independent town of itself, a group of people in Epe town moved out of Epe to develop another town. This can be compared with an establishment of a branch of a company in a new environment. The name of the company remains and only attachment to the new location. From the town EPE, the name \\"Iperu\\" was coined. The Odu Ifa Iperu pointed out that Iperu will be greater than Epe. The possibility of Iperu being a chip off of Epe cannot therefore be ruled out. The fourth school of thought about the name Iperu is quite different from the first three, and seems closest in meaning. It is said that Akesan the founder of Iperu had an earthen pot with which she cooked her boiled maize. One day, the bottom part of the pot caved in due to old age, this in Yoruba means \\"ape ru\\" The word \\"ape\\" in Remo dialect means \\"pot\\" and the word \\"ru\\" means caved-in. From the sentence \\"Ape ru\\", the name of Iperu came into being \\"Iperu\\".The Ijebu Commission of Inquiry between Akarigbo of Remo and Awujale of Ijebu-Ode. Martindale Inquiry Report, 1937 (Vol 1) (Ibadan: Evans Brothers, 2008) From all the four assertions of the name Iperu one cannot confirm the most authentic or the most realistic. One can only argue which one is close to the actual meaning or name, which is the fourth analogy. History Iperu is the part of the Yoruba cultural region of southwestern Nigeria. The city was founded in the mid-19th century when several small towns united for purposes of defense during the wars brought about by the fall of the Oyo Empire. Iperu controlled the trade routes between the ports in the Niger Delta and the Yoruba mainland until the British occupied the area at the end of the 19th century. Iperu has experienced both population and economic growth since the 1950s just like Sagamu due to its position between the cities of Ibadan and Lagos. Iperu is the most centrally placed town in Remo division. Iperu is on a table land, hence, it has erosion problem. The Sagamu - Ibadan road which is a Federal road passed through Iperu. Iperu is a border town to Sagamu, which has a common boundary with it from the south. It is also a border town to Ogere which is a western boundary. It is also a border town to Ode Remo which is a northern boundary. Iperu land is already in close touch with Ode Remo township. It shares its border also with Ilisan, its eastern boundary. You cannot move a kilometre distance without reaching a human habitation among all the Iperu boundary mates. Iperu and its surrounding towns will come together as a unit town within a few years looking at the rate of extension and expansion of all the towns. The population in 1990 was 195,800 but has now declined due migration of the natives to big cities, the 2010 estimates place it as low as 178,412. Sagamu the new seat of the Akarigbo of Remo (\\"King\\" or \\"Lord\\" of Remo), the traditional ruler of the Remo Kingdom is a neighboring town to Iperu. There are several assertions as to the founding of Iperu. All the assertions have their merits and demerits. From the various assertions one can determine the one which is near accurate. \\"For many years it was difficult for local historians and leaders to get hold of the complete proceedings of the Martindale Commission,http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1937/oct/21/ijebu- province which are kept at the National Archives in Ibadan (NAI). In 2008, a group of Remo patriots who called themselves \\"Remo Forum\\" sponsored the publication of the documents in three volumes at a Nigerian publisher. These books contain more detail than I was able to obtain at the National Archives. At the same time, and on the basis of the material I was able to acquire independently of this group i can assert the below\\".The Ijebu Commission of Inquiry between Akarigbo of Remo and Awujale of Ijebu-Ode. Martindale Inquiry Report, 1937 (Volume 1-3) (Ibadan: Evans Brothers, 2008) The first assertion is that Iperu is an offshoot of Ijebu Ode,https://removoicesaloud.wordpress.com/remo-heritage-culture/iperu-remo/ and this is based on the account of a Bisuga, the forefather of Tiyamiyu of the Amororo ruling house whom claimed in the Martindale Report of 1937The Ijebu Commission of Inquiry between Akarigbo of Remo and Awujale of Ijebu-Ode. Martindale Inquiry Report, 1937 (Volume 2) (Ibadan: Evans Brothers, 2008) that hisfather migrated with the son of the Awujale of Ijebo Ode to Iperu where the Awujale son i.e. the Prince met Akesan. The second assertion is that the founder of Iperu was a woman in the name of Akesan. Akesan was a woman traceable to have migrated from Alafin. The assertion further indicated that Akesan was a daughter of one of the Alafin of Oyo. Akesan was married to Ajagbe. They left Oyo and wandered unto the unknown until they reached the present site of Iperu and settled down.https://removoicesaloud.wordpress.com/remo-heritage-culture/iperu-remo/ From all the historical assertions of the originality of Iperu, the migration of Akesan and Ajagbe from Alafin arguable is the best of all assertions. Akesan and Ajagbe are names that occur in everyday talks in Iperu ever since its formation. Even if you meet an Iperu man or woman outside Iperu and he/she is greeted with the term Akesan baale Oja, alarala Ogbe de mu gbe de mu. They smile broadly to the statement. This greeting showed the importance of Akesan in Iperu history. It is confirmed that Iperu is related to Ile Ife, Oyo, Ijebu Ode, and Epe in Sagamu by consanguinity traits and related to Eko, Lagos state by religion as in the Eyo festival which took off from Iperu and was taken to Lagos state many years ago. The EYO festival originated from Iperu remo. It was taken to Lagos for inlawship . Economy The town of Iperu in Remo region is underlain by major deposits of limestone, which is used in the area's major industry, the production of cement. Agricultural products of the region include cocoa and kola nuts. Iperu is one of the largest kola nut collecting centers in the country. The kola nut industry supports several secondary industries such as basket and rope manufacturing, which are used to store the kola nuts. Also the town plays host to a cargo airport, which when completed would serve as a faster means to transport finished produce from the inner lands out. Cuisine The traditional delicacy of iperu includes ebiripo(a traditional meal made from cocoa yam),ikokore or ifokore(a delicacy shared by the majority of ijebu people),ojojo etc. See also *Lagos *Sagamu  References  Populated places in Ogun State Local Government Areas in Ogun State Towns in Yorubaland ","title":"Iperu, Ogun"},{"id":"30044006","title":"Karnataka Public Works Department"},{"id":"30044038","text":"Driving Force may refer to: Arts and entertainment * Driving Force (TV series), an American reality television program * Driving Force (album), a 2005 album by 3rd Force * Driving Force (arcade game), a 1984 arcade video game by Shinkai * Driving Force (1989 film), a 1989 action film * Driving Force (1921 film), a 1921 German silent film Other uses * Logitech Driving Force GT, a model of steering wheel See also * Force, in physics * Reversal potential, in a biological membrane ","title":"Driving Force"},{"id":"30044044","text":"Less Than Zero may refer to: * \\"Less Than Zero\\" (song), a 1977 song by Elvis Costello * Less Than Zero (novel), a 1985 novel by Bret Easton Ellis * Less Than Zero (film), a 1987 film directed by Marek Kanievska based on the 1985 novel by Bret Easton Ellis * Less Than Zero (TV series), a 2018 TV series adaption of the 1985 novel. * Less Than Zero (soundtrack), the soundtrack to the 1987 film * Less Than Zero (album), a 2005 album by LA Symphony * Any negative number ","title":"Less Than Zero"},{"id":"30044080","text":"Barrayar is a science fiction novel by American writer Lois McMaster Bujold. It was first published as four installments in Analog in July‚ÄìOctober 1991, and then published in book form by Baen Books in October 1991. Barrayar won both the Hugo Award for Best Novel and the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 1992. It is a part of the Vorkosigan Saga, and is the seventh full-length novel of the series, in publication order. Barrayar is a direct sequel to Bujold's first novel, Shards of Honor (1986), and the two are paired in the 1996 omnibus Cordelia's Honor.  Plot summary  Cordelia and Aral Vorkosigan are expecting their first child. Before crafty old Emperor Ezar Vorbarra died, he maneuvered a very reluctant Aral into agreeing to serve as regent for Ezar's young grandson Gregor. A plot to assassinate the Vorkosigans with poison gas fails, but the antidote, while effective, is also a powerful teratogen that poses a grave threat to the bone development of their unborn son. In a desperate attempt to save the fetus, Cordelia has it transferred to a uterine replicator ‚Äî an artificial womb ‚Äî to undergo experimental treatment that may partially combat the otherwise-fatal bone damage. Barrayar, due to its harsh environment, has fostered a deep loathing for mutations, and babies with even minor birth defects are routinely euthanized. Aral's father, Count Piotr Vorkosigan, seeks to abort the fetus rather than have the Vorkosigan name and title passed on to a \\"deformed mutant.\\" A furious Cordelia keeps him at bay. When Count Vidal Vordarian attempts a coup, five-year-old Gregor is rescued by his loyal security chief, Captain Negri, and reunited with the Vorkosigans. Cordelia, Gregor and bodyguard Konstantin Bothari hide from Vordarian's men in the hills, while Aral and his father organize the resistance. After Cordelia rejoins Aral, they learn that the replicator containing their child, whom they have named Miles, has been captured. Without proper maintenance, the fetus will succumb within six days, but Aral refuses to attempt a rescue when there are far greater concerns. However, Cordelia's personal bodyguard, Ludmilla Droushnakovi, was previously stationed at the palace and knows several top-secret exit routes which can be used to slip inside undetected. Cordelia, Droushnakovi and Bothari set out to rescue Miles and hopefully Gregor's mother, Princess Kareen. When Clement Koudelka, one of Aral's officers, finds out, they kidnap him. In Vorbarr Sultana, they witness the capture of Lady Alys Vorpatril and the murder of her husband, Padma. They rescue Alys, who is pregnant with the future Ivan Vorpatril. While in hiding, she delivers her son thanks to Bothari, who learned midwifery watching his mother minister to prostitutes. Cordelia dispatches Koudelka to get her to safety and sets out with Bothari and Droushnakovi to get Miles. Once in the palace, Cordelia and her party are caught in a trap. They manage to overpower their captors, but not before Princess Kareen is killed attempting to shoot Vordarian, who had told her Gregor was dead. In the ensuing confusion, Bothari manages to set fire to a good portion of the Imperial Palace to cover their retreat as they take Vordarian himself hostage. When Vordarian defies their orders, Bothari beheads Vordarian at Cordelia's order, and they escape with the replicator - and Vordarian's head - via the secret passages. Cordelia returns to Aral's base of operations and throws down the head in front of a delegation of Vordarian's allies. Without its leader, the coup falls apart. Miles is born, fragile and deformed. Five years later, he has very brittle bones, but is very active, rambunctious and intelligent, capturing even Piotr's affection. In a side plot, Koudelka and Droushnakovi fall in love before the coup and indulge in some, to them, illicit sexual activity at Vorkosigan House. Cordelia, being a liberal-minded Betan, sees no harm in this but both are ashamed. While they are in hiding during the coup events, Cordelia acts as a traditional \\"go-between\\" to patch up their relationship, so they can consummate it without guilt. Koudelka believes he forced himself on Droushnakovi. Droushnakovi demonstrates how impossible this would have been by putting him in a choke hold. After the coup, they are married in the best Barrayaran fashion. In novels set later in the timeline, they are the parents of four outstanding young women who combine brains, beauty and, thanks to their mother, deadly unarmed combat skills. Reception Barrayar won both the Hugo Award for Best Novel and the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 1992. It was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1991.

Biography  Jay was born in Yorkshire in December 1919. He moved to Stibbard, near Fakenham in Norfolk, at the age of eighteen months. In 1940, he moved south to Diss, but ten years later a university appointment took him back to Yorkshire, and he lived in Cottingham until his death. alt=  Academic career  Appleton was an alumnus of the University of Oxford and the University of Durham where he attended King's College, which is now Newcastle University.

In 1970, he wrote a report for the Countryside Commission on 'Disused railways in the countryside of England and Wales'. In 1975, Appleton published The Experience of Landscape, in which he proposed the prospect- refuge theory of human aesthetics.

Personal life Kim Kurniawan was born in M√ºhlacker, Germany, to Uschi, a German, and Petrus Kurniawan, a Chinese Indonesian. His grandfather, Kwee Hong Sing, was a national team footballer who played for Persija Jakarta and the Indonesian national football team in the 1950s. Born with German nationality, Kurniawan decided to become Indonesian after the Football Association of Indonesia offered him a position on its national team. In December 2010, he officially received an Indonesian passport and, after Cristian Gonz√°les, became the second naturalized football player in that country; Gonz√°les had done so in November 2010. Youth career Karlsruher SC After training at a soccer school in Karlsruhe, Kurniawan, then age 6, was asked by the coach of the German Bundesliga club \\"Karlsruher SC\\" to join them. He stayed on for 12 years, participating in games against international clubs such as Inter Milan, FC Valencia and other German clubs like Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Schalke 04 and Bayer 04 Leverkusen. Kurniawan suffered a knee injury at 18 in his last junior season, ending his professional football career in Germany. Adult career FC 07 Heidelsheim His knee injury kept him away from the ball for the better part of a year. Eventually, Kurniawan joined FC 07 Heidelsheim which played Verbandsliga at the time. He enjoyed a successful first season, playing in every game while scoring two goals. He had agreed to extend his contract but this changed after he received an invitation to play in Indonesia. Persema Malang Kurniawan went to Indonesia in early 2010 with two other footballers of Indonesian descent, Irfan Bachdim and Alessandro Trabucco.Red Garuda leading, Irfan scored (Indonesian) His career there started with an invitation to a charity game \\"Garuda Merah vs. Garuda Putih\\" in Surabaya and Malang in 2010. Timo Scheunemann also contacted Kurniawan and offered him a trial at Persema Malang, a professional 1st division team in Malang. Coach Timo then made him a part of his team. However, Kurniawan didn't have an Indonesian passport at the time and couldn't play until he officially became Indonesian. An injury also kept him from playing on the national team for the Suzuki AFF Cup 2010 but he signed a contract with Persema Malang and stayed for almost three years. Kurniawan later tried playing in Thailand. Pelita Bandung Raya Back in Indonesia in 2014, Kurniawan played in the Indonesia Super League as part of Pelita Bandung Raya (PBR). Dejan Antonic was the coach at that time, and Kurniawan played for two seasons with his final two tournaments being Piala Presiden and Piala J. Sudirman. Persib Bandung Kurniawan joined Persib Bandung in 2016. The team lost the final in both the Bali Island Cup and the Piala Bhayangkara to Arema Malang during his first season. In the Torabika Soccer Championship competition his team placed fifth. Kurniawan's second season saw his team place third in the Piala Presiden and 13th in \\"Gojek Traveloka Liga 1.\\" He broke his fibula at the end of the season after being tackled by a Persija Jakarta player. Kim Jeffrey Kurniawan International career In 2011, Kurniawan received the call from the u23 national team of Indonesia to play in the Sea Games 2011.

They specialize in producing hand made custom electric guitars and basses. In addition to building guitars, Dan Becker operates a guitar repair and restoration shop.  History  Becker Guitars began in 1995 as a repair shop in the basement of founder Dan Becker. After its first years of operation, Becker Guitars moved to a new shop in Stoughton, Massachusetts. While the company grew into a full service guitar repair and restoration center, Becker began venturing into guitarmaking. In the spring of 2006 Dan Becker brought on Maine guitar luthier Ryan Martin and began to focus on designing and producing custom instruments. Becker soon moved from its smaller shop in Stoughton, Massachusetts to a larger space in Attleboro, Massachusetts in order to accommodate a growing production line. In the fall of 2007 Becker unveiled their first prototype, an Imperial model, to the public at the first annual Premier Guitar Festival. 2008 saw the release of Becker Guitars' flagship production line, The Retro Series. Initially introduced as a 22 fret, bolt-on neck guitar, The Retro Series was updated in 2011 to feature 24 frets, neck-through construction, and additional woods and finishes. Since 2011 Becker Guitars has introduced its second production line, the HeadHunter Series. The HeadHunter Series consisted of 24 fret, neck-through guitars with figured maple tops, burst finishes, and semi-hollow options. In addition to the Retro and HeadHunter series, Becker continued to build custom guitars, basses, and other stringed instruments until the spring of 2016 when Martin left the company. Unable to produce instruments Becker was forced underground. Martin has since relocated to Bristol New Hampshire establishing Magic Wand Guitars. He continues to build the same instruments he designed and created under the Becker brand.

A., Field Artillery and Firepower, Naval Institute Press, 2004, p.560 The firing weapon must have a sighting device and an unobstructed view to the target, which means no objects or friendly units can be between it and the target. A weapon engaged in direct fire exposes itself to return fire from the target.p.49, Bailey This is in contrast to indirect fire, which refers to firing a projectile on a ballistic trajectory or delivering munitions by guided or unguided missiles. Indirect fire does not need a direct line of sight to the target because the shots are normally directed by a forward observer. As such, indirect-fire weapons can shoot over obstacles or friendly units and the weapons can be concealed from counter-battery fire. Description Examples of direct-fire weapons include most ancient and modern weapons such as bows, handguns, rifles, machine guns, and recoilless rifles. The term is most often used in the context of artillery, such as howitzers and mortars. Direct fire remained the dominant method of operating artillery throughout most of human history, with indirect fire used for sieges and involving specific siege guns.p.211, Bailey Technological developments born of the Industrial Revolution and the development of technical practices in the late 19th century led to an appreciation of indirect fire, although it was not until World War I that indirect fire supplanted direct fire as the primary method by which artillery supported the other combat arms. During World War II direct fire remained secondary to indirect fire, although it was used profusely in situations where indirect fire was less effective, and new direct-fire artillery such as anti- tank guns and anti-aircraft guns were developed.p.50, Bailey Artillery using direct fire After World War II new technology continued to diminish the role of direct fire; however, in several situations it remains a necessary function on the modern battlefield. One of these is the defense of fixed fortified areas ‚Äì for example fire support bases ‚Äì for which specific firing techniques and munitions such as Killer Junior and Beehive anti-personnel rounds were developed. Another is when artillery is forced to defend itself, such as in a surprise attack. This could be the result of rapid maneuvering by ground forces, an attack by airborne troops, or from the lack of defined front lines as found in counterinsurgency operations. Direct-fire artillery can also be massed to counter a penetration by enemy tanks. In particular self-propelled artillery are ideally suited for this role on account of their mobility, armor protection, and faster rate of fire compared to other weapons.p.51-54, Bailey A final situation is in urban warfare, where locating the enemy can be difficult, the physical structures give the defenders better protection, and the risk of collateral damage is high. In these cases direct-fire artillery can unleash tremendous firepower to precisely destroy enemy fortified positions.p.83, Bailey See also *Gun laying *Fire-control radar *Director (military) *Telescopic sight *Line-of-sight (missile) References Footnotes Bibliography * Artillery operation Military terminology ","title":"Direct fire"},{"id":"30044182","text":"Post Lake is an unincorporated census-designated place located in the town of Elcho, Langlade County, Wisconsin, United States.

It is one of just two species of grasshopper listed for protection under the New Zealand Wildlife Act 1953 (the other is Brachaspis robustus). The genus Sigaus is endemic to New Zealand.  Taxonomy  Sigaus childi was described by Colleen Jamieson in 1999, from a male specimen collected on 15 December 1997 at Galloway Station, Otago (). The holotype and paratype are deposited in the Otago Museum, Dunedin. The species was named after the late Peter Child of Alexandra, who first collected it from Graveyard Gully in 1967.Bigelow, R.S. The Grasshoppers of New Zealand, Their Taxonomy and Distribution. University of Canterbury, Christchurch. 1967. p.60.  Description  Sigaus childi displaying its cryptic coloration Sigaus childi is morphologically cryptic and polymorphic in colour, ranging from pale grey through earthy tones to green and black. Some individuals closely match foliose lichens that grow in rocks in the area, but others more closely resemble gravels or pebbles. They rely on camouflage rather than hopping to evade predators, and their hops are short: 30‚Äì40 cm and 15 cm high. The wings on S. childi are very small ‚Äì between ; like most New Zealand grasshoppers, this species is flightless. Males are long; females are twice as large, . They have no ears, and do not sing.  Distribution and habitat  Typical S. childi habitat (Galloway Station )This species has a patchy distribution in a small area of about 200 square kilometres around the township of Alexandra, 200‚Äì500 m above sea level. Searches have been carried out on the northern end of the Knobby Range, North Rough Ridge, and the Rock and Pillar Range: all have failed to locate further populations.Morris, S.J. Grasshopper Identification Sheet ‚Äì Sigaus childi. Department of Conservation, Alexandra.Morris, S.J. 2003. Distribution and Taxonomic status of New Zealand endangered grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae). Department of Conservation, Wellington. Sigaus childi is primarily found on dry, open, sparsely vegetated slopes, usually on north-facing hillsides, but rarely on modified farmland. Most of these sites appear rocky, mainly due to their low growing and sparse vegetation. Another more widespread species, S. australis, that lives mostly in subalpine habitat in the mountain ranges nearby, also occurs in this lowland semi-arid habitat. This brings it into close contact and sympatry with S. childi at some locations. Genetic data indicate extensive gene flow between these two species.  Conservation  Threats to S. childi include introduced predators such as cats, rodents, mustelids, and hedgehogs. They are also eaten by native skinks. Rabbits compete with them for food plants (sorrel, hare's-foot clover, viper's bugloss, and Raoulia). Sigaus grasshoppers evolved during Pleistocene glaciations and are adapted to arid open habitats, so they are threatened by landscape modification like irrigation.

It was completed in 1968 and is operated by the Army Corps of Engineers for the purpose of flood control. This larger reservoir is also known as its older obsolete name Marion Lake which is often confused with the similar named yet smaller Marion County Lake which is south-east of Marion. Most locals refer to the larger body of water using the term 'Reservoir' (this article), and the smaller body of water using the term 'Lake'. Geography Marion Reservoir is located in Gale Township of Marion County, Kansas, United States. There are many entrances into the reservoir area. A two-lane paved road runs along the top length of the dam. The south edge of the dam is located approximately 1/2 mile north of U.S. Route 56 on Old Mill Road, where there is an information kiosk and public restrooms. The unincorporated community of Eastshore is located north-east of the dam. The closest cities are Marion (east of reservoir) and Hillsboro (west of reservoir). History Early history For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. 19th century In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1806, Zebulon Pike led the Pike Expedition westward from St Louis, Missouri, of which part of their journey followed the Cottonwood River through Marion County including the land under the Reservoir. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1855, Marion County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Reservoir.The History of Marion County and Courthouse 20th century In June and July 1951, the \\"Great Flood of 1951\\" occurred with a peak discharge of and a volume of which is equivalent to of runoff from the drainage area above the dam site.Marion Reservoir - Information The 1951 record flood in the region was one of the leading reasons for building the Marion Reservoir, and downstream leevee's in the cities of Marion and Florence.

At over long, it is the river's longest tributary and is one of the southernmost streams in the Klamath Basin. It winds through a generally steep and narrow course north then west through the forested Klamath Mountains, but also passes through the Hayfork and Hyampom Valleys, which comprise the primary agricultural regions of Trinity County. The watershed of the creek was originally inhabited by the Wintu people. Human habitation in the basin goes back for more than 5,000 years. The first Euro- Americans arrived in the late 1820s, but the basin was not developed until the 1850s with the onset of the California Gold Rush. The fertile soils and mild climate of the river valley led to it becoming the most prosperous agricultural area of the county. Logging began in the 1920s, and by the 1940s started to have an adverse impact on the ecology of the watershed, which includes once-abundant populations of Coho salmon and steelhead trout. Course The Hayfork rises on the west flank of Brushy Mountain some south of the hamlet of Wildwood. Flowing generally north through a deep forested valley in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, it receives the East Fork from the right. Five miles (8 km) downstream, it enters the Hayfork Valley, a large agricultural basin in the middle of the Klamath Mountains. Here it receives Summit and Big Creeks from the right, while Salt Creek enters from the left. The stream also passes State Route 3 and the small town of Hayfork. Winding northwest out of the valley, the river enters a steep gorge, plunging over whitewater rapids and around giant boulders between narrow cliffs. At the Miners Creek confluence from the right, Hayfork Creek turns west and shortly afterwards receives Corral Creek, also from the right. Approximately a mile (1.6 km) above the mouth the river spills out of the mountains into the town of Hyampom in the Hyampom Valley. It joins the South Fork of the Trinity just south of the town of Hyampom, above the larger river's mouth on the Trinity River. Discharge The U.S. Geological Survey had a stream gauge on Hayfork Creek at Hyampom from 1954 to 1974. During the twenty years of record, the average discharge at the mouth was calculated from monthly mean discharges. The largest peak flow was in December 1964. The lowest monthly average was in September 1960. There was also a gauge at Hayfork from 1956 to 1976. The mean annual discharge for this location was (1956‚Äì1965, as there was no data recorded for monthly flows after 1965). The maximum peak flow was during the storms of December 1964 at . The minimum monthly average was in August 1959. Watershed Hayfork Creek drains a mountainous, remote watershed of situated entirely within southern Trinity County. Although the majority of the basin is covered by the Klamath Mountains, it also contains some of Trinity County's only significant amounts of arable land in the Hayfork and Hyampom Valleys. Elevations in the watershed range from at Chanchelulla Peak, the basin's highest point, to at the river's mouth. About 78.6% of the watershed or lies within public lands, mostly owned by the U.S. Forest Service. The remaining 21.4% is private land, mainly used for cattle ranching and farming. The Hayfork Creek watershed divide separates it from several other river valleys. The entire western boundary lies along the divide with the South Fork Trinity River. To the northwest lies the valley of the main stem of the Trinity River. In the east, a long ridge separates the Hayfork basin from the Sacramento Valley, specifically the headwaters of a stream, Cottonwood Creek, which drains to the Sacramento River. The mountains generally decrease in height from east to west, from over along the eastern ridges to on the mountains above the South Fork Trinity River. The headwaters of the creek itself lie at an elevation of over . The Hayfork Valley lies at an elevation of . The geography of the watershed is widely varied, from subalpine in the Chanchellula Wilderness and on Hayfork Bally down to hot, dry scrub and chaparral in the lower river valley. The dominant vegetation type is mixed conifer-hardwood forest, with common species including douglas-fir, ponderosa and grey pine, California black oak, canyon live oak, common and hairy manzanita, and huckleberry oak, as well as many riparian species including bigleaf maple, Pacific dogwood, white alder, and black cottonwood. Hayfork Valley is comprised mainly of oak and grey pine woodlands and grasslands, although much of this has been altered to accommodate housing and agriculture. In the valley, the creek suffers from high water temperatures and contamination due to ranching along the stream's banks and water diversions from tributaries. In some places the creek went subsurface in 2014 at the height of the drought. There are many small diversions from the tributaries, both legal and illegal. The biggest diversion is from Big Creek north of Hayfork, which diverts water for Big Creek Ranch and Ewing Reservoir, Hayfork's water supply. The water district is authorized to divert water from December 1st until June 1st of each winter, and they slowly deplete the reservoir all summer. The only significant town along the creek is Hayfork, with a population of about 2,368. Hyampom, with 241, is the only other Census Designated Place, although only about 1/4 of Hyampom's population lives in the Hayfork Creek watershed. Other settlements in the watershed are Peanut, population 73, and Wildwood, with 64. Hayfork is the second largest town in Trinity County after Weaverville, the county seat, and is central to the Hayfork Valley, the primary agricultural region in Trinity County. Other towns within the basin include Peanut, which is located on Salt Creek, and Wildwood, situated near the headwaters of the Hayfork. The total human population of the watershed is approximately 2,750-3,000Smith, Josh; Buxton, Cindy; Buell, Mary. \\"Water Conservation Measures For The South Fork Trinity River Watershed.\\" May 2016.

If you subtract the 2368 people who live in Hayfork, it becomes 1-1.7 people per square mile. Geology The stream flows through an area of the Klamath Mountains created by uplift caused by the collision of multiple exotic terranes (in this case, a fragment of uplifted crust formed by tectonic activity on the Pacific Plate) with the North American plate. The resulting buckling stress caused the formation of the mountain ranges of northwestern California in stages. Hayfork Creek runs across the western part of the Hayfork Terrane, which was formed about 165 million years ago by plutonic activity beneath the Pacific Plate, and collided with the North American Plate sometime between 140 and 120 million years ago. By the mid-Paleocene, approximately 59 million years ago, the Klamath Mountains first rose; erosion and orogeny occurred over time continuing to this day, with the last great mountain-building period in the Pleistocene, about 1.6 million years ago. It is believed that the present course of the stream had been established prior to the formation of the mountains ‚Äì as they rose, the creek's erosional force cut canyons and valleys into the bedrock, maintaining its course. The Hayfork Valley is an alluvial basin filled with sediments at least deep deposited by Hayfork, Carr, Barker, Big, Salt and other streams from the surrounding water. Approximately of the alluvium dates from the Holocene less than 12,000 years ago. The valley is underlain by the Hayfork Valley Groundwater Basin which ranges from below the surface. History The Wintu Native American tribe (specifically the Nor-El- Muk or Hayfork Wintu, one of six major divisions of the tribe) lived along Hayfork Creek. The range of the Wintu extended roughly through the highlands and mountains of the upper Hayfork Creek basin bordering on the Hayfork Valley, although archaeological sites comprising spearheads and arrowheads have been discovered as far downstream as Hyampom. The Wintu established permanent winter camps on streams, and during the spring and summer traveled to farther and higher-elevation areas to hunt. The staple food of the Native Americans was salmon, which thrived in abundance in the rivers of the region. Other important foods included, acorn various types of berries or small game. The first outsider to see Hayfork Creek was fur trapper Jedediah Smith in the dawn of 1828, who was leading an expedition from northern California into Oregon. Their route took them up Hayfork Creek, the South Fork Trinity River, and the Trinity and Klamath Rivers before they arrived on the far north Pacific coast of California. However, the party did not stay in the area for long. The route along lower Hayfork Creek that Smith and his men had taken later became a trade path between the Central Valley and coastal Oregon. Following the California Gold Rush, in which gold was discovered along the Trinity River in 1848, Americans began to settle the Hayfork Valley and because of its abundant water, mild climate and fertile soils it quickly became the most productive agricultural area or the \\"breadbasket\\" of Trinity County. Miners worked claims along the upper section of the creek and along some of its headwaters tributaries. In 1851, the town of Hayfork was first established, and was originally named Kingsberrys. The town boomed because of the valley's rapidly improving economy, reaching a population of 1,200 by 1860. The Hyampom Valley, while smaller than the Hayfork Valley, has similar qualities and the first permanent European settlements were built in the 1860s. In 1852, a settler from Weaverville, a town situated about northeast of the Hayfork Valley, was reportedly killed by Native Americans and his herd of cattle stolen. After his body was found, a searching party tracked the natives to their camp on the confluence of Bridge Gulch and Hayfork Creek, the former of which is spanned by a natural bridge made infamous from the impending events. About 70 whites set out from Weaverville within a week of the murder, and killed 153 of the 158 Native Americans in what became known as the Bridge Gulch Massacre.Hoover, Rensch & Rensch, p. 555 Ecology Historically Hayfork Creek was one of the more productive steelhead and salmon streams of the Trinity River basin. Agricultural runoff since the late 1800s has hurt the ecosystem of the creek downstream of Hayfork, which comprises the largest farming region of the watershed. Logging, as well as land clearing for ranching and grazing, has caused increased amounts of sediments to wash into the stream, clouding the water and endangering fish populations. The upper section of the creek is polluted from acid mine drainage, most notably from the Kelly Mine on McCovey Gulch, which issues significant amounts of chromium and arsenic. In recent years, the temperature of the creek near the mouth has risen above in dry summers, posing fatal conditions to fish. Records show a high mortality rate of female salmon and recurring fish kills, probably caused by the high temperatures and the clouding of water by contaminants and sediments that wash down from agricultural and built-up areas. One of the biggest problems for the watershed is the loss of forested lands. Although timberland loss is more pronounced in the South Fork Trinity valley than the Hayfork basin, suspended sediment loads in the creek have been rising above ecologically safe limits since 1944. The underlying rock in the Hayfork Creek watershed is generally stable, but erosion has increased because of the construction of roads. There are several species of endangered or threatened animals that live within the watershed, including the Northern spotted owl and peregrine falcon. The Hayfork Creek valley also provides a major component of the flight path of migratory birds travelling between the Pacific coast and the Sacramento Valley. Tourism and recreation The creek is known throughout Trinity County for its recreational gold mining. Reputedly some of the best spots for mining in Northern California lie along the Hayfork upstream of the Hayfork Valley and below Wildwood. The geology of the stream bed is described as a \\"natural gold trap\\" and recent strikes have been made there of up to 60 ounces in one day. For experienced kayakers and rafters, the upper and lower thirds of Hayfork Creek are filled with rapids ranging from Class III to V. Especially in the lower portion of the creek, large boulders and waterfalls require strenuous portages; and high flow fluctuations (the river has no dams and only a few diversions) cause the stream to range between and in any given year.

They soon realized that their food sold better than their bubble tea beverages, so in late 2005, they moved their shop to the basement of Flushing‚Äôs Golden Shopping Mall and called it Xi‚Äôan Famous Foods. After Wang graduated in 2009 with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in business, he worked in corporate for a short time, but then decided to focus on co-founding his family food business with his father. From that moment, Wang and his father continued expanding their food business to Manhattan and Brooklyn, opening eight more shops. Wang and his father made and sold their homemade Liang Pi Cold-Skin Noodles, Spicy Cumin Lamb Burgers, hand-ripped noodles and other specialties, offering a taste of home to their own ethnic community. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to keep it pure, because that‚Äôs what people are coming to us for,‚Äù Wang told the New York Times.  Operations  Storefront on Saint Marks Place In late 2005, the original Xi‚Äôan Famous Foods opened in the basement of the Golden Mall in Flushing, Queens. In August 2009, two more shops opened, one in Flushing and one on East Broadway, but were both closed due to their limited space and facilities not conducive to the growing operations. In 2010, Xi‚Äôan Famous Foods brought their authentic Xi‚Äôan cuisine to Manhattan in the East Village on St. Marks Place. Following its success, another shop opened in Chinatown ten months later. The company continued to expand rapidly. By end of 2016, Xi'an Famous Foods had opened six more shops in Manhattan, one in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and a sister restaurant called Biang! in the East Village which has since closed. Its Long Island City, Queens location was closed January 9, 2020, due to a fire, which had been started on the roof. Xi‚Äôan Famous Foods plans on expanding its food empire along the east coast within the next five years with the purchase of their newest 20,000 square foot building to be developed into the newest central kitchen. Xi'an Famous Foods corporate office was established in Manhattan near the Empire State building and is in place to support the operations of the restaurants and its expansion.  Press  Since Xi‚Äôan Famous Foods rapid expansion in New York, the Queens restaurant chain has been picked up by many media outlets. Most recently in January 2016, Xi‚Äôan Famous Foods was named the ‚Äú#2 Chinese Restaurant in the USA‚Äù by Time Out and ‚ÄúBreakout Brand of 2016‚Äù by Restaurant News. Following that mention, media outlets such as Business Insider and NBC Asian-American have picked up on Xi‚Äôan Famous Foods‚Äô story.  Biang!  Biang! was a scion of the Xi'an Famous Foods brand, situated in a chic venue with full waiter-service. Biang!'s Full Liquor License also gave them the chance to offer a variety of Chinese Baijiu to its customers. In 2012, Biang! first opened its doors in Flushing as a proper, table-service version of their fast casual original. During its operation, Biang! received one star from The New York Times, and was also included on Michelin's Bib Gourmand list. In December 2015, the original location of Biang! closed its doors and moved to Manhattan's East Village. Opened in January 2016, the Biang! seats 40 and served all its popular skewers and noodle dishes to its customers. With Biang!'s Full Liquor License, it also offered a variety of Chinese Baijiu at the bar. It closed in March 2017.

He played college football and baseball at the University of Nebraska. He later served as an assistant football coach at the University of Michigan (1920‚Äì1923), University of Southern California (1924), and UCLA (1925‚Äì1948). He was also the head coach of the UCLA Bruins baseball team from 1927 to 1931, in 1933, and again from 1943 to 1945. Early years He was born in South Bend, Nebraska, in 1888 and attended high school in Lincoln, Nebraska. He attended the University of Nebraska and played halfback and fullback for the 1908 and 1909 Nebraska Cornhuskers football teams. After graduating from Nebraska, Sturzenegger enrolled at Harvard Law School. He left Harvard to accept a coaching job at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. During World War I, he served aboard the USS Neptune as an ensign in the United States Navy. After being discharged from the Navy in 1919, Sturzenegger returned to South Bend to manage his father's store. Michigan Sturzenegger at Michigan, 1921 In January 1920, he was hired as an assistant football coach under Fielding H. Yost at the University of Michigan. He was an assistant coach at Michigan from 1920 to 1923. While at Michigan, Sturzenegger served as a scout and as assistant coach responsible for the halfbacks and ends. In October 1921, a University of Michigan publication wrote that Sturznegger's \\"flat helmet has been a familiar sight on Ferry Field for several seasons. 'Sturz' hails from Nebraska and has an uncanny ability in imparting the fundamentals and tricks of the game to linemen and backs as well.\\" USC In April 1924, Sturzenegger was hired by USC as an assistant football coach. He was a resident of Los Angeles at the time of his hiring. At the time, the Los Angeles Times reported: \\"Coach Sturzenegger is regarded in the Middle West as the best 'scout' of football teams in the country and during his five years at Michigan was in no small degree responsible for the success of the Yost teams. He had charge of the ends and backs and was a particular success at teaching the manly art of blocking to the ends and backs. ... He is famous throughout the country for the manner in which he teaches, as he dons a football suit and personally blocks, tackles and runs with the ball, not to mention letting the boys try their stuff on him.\\" UCLA In September 1925, Sturzenegger was hired by UCLA as an assistant football coach under new head coach William H. Spaulding. At the time, Los Angeles Times columnist Bill Henry wrote that Spaulding had made \\"a fine move\\" in hiring \\"Sturzy.\\" Henry continued: \\"The gentleman with the lengthy name has one of the finest of reputations in the Middle West as a developer of ends and backs and as a scout. He is a football 'nut.' He has a fine position, which he has held for a long time, with the trust department of a big local bank, but aside from his business he is chiefly interested in football. He goes to every game within reach and returns with every play of both teams accurately diagrammed. When he coaches he doesn't tell 'em he shows 'em. He puts on a uniform and gets out and rough-houses with the boys until they're glad to quit. Sturzenegger continued to serve as an assistant football coach at UCLA for more than 20 years. At the time of his death in 1949, the Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"Once termed the greatest scout in the game, 'Sturzy', as he was known to everyone at Westwood, became famous for his blackboard chalk talks.\\" In February 1927, Sturzenegger was also assigned the position as UCLA's head baseball coach. He had played baseball at Nebraska and coached it at Rennselaer Polytechnic. He remained the head coach of UCLA's baseball team from 1927 to 1931, in 1933, and again from 1943 to 1945. In October 1929, Sturzenegger added responsibilities as UCLA's assistant graduate manager. In November 1938, Sturzenegger fell gravely ill with pneumonia while traveling with the football team to play Washington State College in Pullman, Washington. Eleven ounces of pneumonia serum were flown from Burbank, California, to Oakland, California, to meet the special train carrying Sturzenegger back to Los Angeles. He was hospitalized for several days at Hollywood Hospital after the team returned to Los Angeles and made a full recovery. Death and family Sturzenegger died in April 1949.

The name Associated was for the Tidewater Associated Oil Company, owner of the site. The refinery was first built in 1913 under the name Avon Refinery, and has been continually expanded since. It was purchased by Tosco in 1976. By the 1990s, a history of poor maintenance and under-staffing gave the refinery a reputation for being a hazardous workplace. Throughout the 1990s, it led the US refining industry in the number of environmental and safety code violations. These poor conditions culminated in two catastrophic accidents. In the first, a 1997 hydrocracker explosion killed one worker. In the second of these, four workers died and a fifth was hospitalized in a 1999 naphtha explosion. A maintenance supervisor refused to shut down the unit after corroding valves failed to stop the flow of the extremely hazardous substance. In November 2010, the refinery had a flaring event, due to a simultaneous PG&E; utility power and Foster Wheeler co-generation plant failure, that produced large quantities of thick black smoke. In February 2015, a nationwide strike by USW represented employees resulted in the closure of the Martinez refinery, the only refinery closure resulting from the strike. On December 15, 2015, thick smoke and flames could be seen rising up from the refinery. Due to the loss of a primary steam generation unit, flaring was done to release pressure. A Level 2 alert was issued to the community, recommending that they stay indoors due to smoke blowing offsite. The alert was reduced to Level 0 on the same day. On July 31, 2020, Marathon announced plans to permanently idle the refinery and use it as an oil-storage facility while evaluating its future use to produce renewable diesel.

Slurry pumps changes in design and construction to adjust to multiple type of slurry which varies in concentration of solids, size of solid particles, shape of solid particles, and composition of solution. Slurry pump are more robust than liquid pumps; they have added sacrificial material and replaceable wear parts to withstand wear due to abrasion. Centrifugal, positive displacement, and vortex pumps can be used for slurry. Centrifugal slurry pumps can have between bearing-supported shafts with split casing or rubber- or metal-lined casing. Configurations include horizontal, vertical suspended and submersible. Slurry is usually classified according to the concentration of solids. Engineering classification of slurry is more complex and involves concentration, particle size, shape and weight in order to determine abrasion severity. For engineering selection of slurry pumps, slurry is classified as class 1, class 2, class 3 and class 4. Selection of slurry pumps is more difficult than selection of pumps for water and liquids. Many factors and corrections to the duty point affect brake horsepower and wear. Root-dynamic Centrifugal Slurry Pumps (ANSI/HI 12.1-12.6-2016) provides methods for calculation of slurry pumps. The peripheral speed of the impeller is one of the main features and classification of slurry pumps. Speed must be in accordance with the slurry type classification (abrasion classification) in order to maintain a reasonable life in service due to high abrasion of solids. Before selecting an appropriate slurry pump the engineers considers capacity, head, solids handling capacity, efficiency and power, speed and NPSH. Slurry pumps are widely used in transport of abrasive solids in industries such as mining, dredging, and steel. They are often designed to be suitable for heavy- wearing and heavy-duty uses. Depending on the mining process, some slurries are corrosive which presents a challenge because corrosion-resistant materials like stainless steel are softer than high-iron steel. The most common metal alloy used to build slurry pumps is known as \\"high chrome\\", which is basically white iron with 25% chromium added to make it less brittle. Rubber line casings are also used for certain application where the solid particles are small.  Components  ; Impeller: The impeller, either elastomer, stainless steel or high-chrome material, is the main rotating component which normally has vanes to impart the centrifugal force to the liquid. ; Casing: Split outer casing halves of cast contain the wear liners and provide high operation pressure capabilities. The casing shape is generally of semi-volute or concentric, efficiencies of which are less than that of the volute type. ; Shaft and Bearing Assembly: A large diameter shaft with a short overhang minimizes deflection and vibration. Heavy-duty roller bearing are housed in a removable bearing cartridge. ; Shaft sleeve: A hardened, heavy-duty corrosion- resistant sleeve with O-ring seals at both ends protects the shaft. A split fit allows the sleeve removed or installed quickly. ; Shaft Seal: Expeller drive seal, Packing seal, Mechanical seal. ; Drive Type: V-belt drive, gear reducer drive, fluid coupling drive, and frequency conversion drive devices.  Types  ; Submersible:Submersible slurry pumps are placed at the bottom of a tank, lagoon, pond, or another water-filled environment, and suction solids and liquids right at the pump itself. The materials are taken in at the intake and passed through a hose connected to the discharge valve. ; Self-Priming:A self-priming slurry pump is operated from land, and a hose is connected to the pump's intake valve. The self-priming pump draws the slurry to the pump then discharges the material from there. ; Flooded Suction:The flooded suction slurry pump is connected to a tank or hopper and uses gravity to move slurry and liquid from the enclosure. Located at the bottom or below the water, the pump uses the force of gravity to continuously fill the pump and then passes the material out through the discharge valve.

Xiaochi are substantial snacks, which could be eaten together or with more substantial dishes like the Spanish tapas or Middle Eastern Levantine meze, or alone as a light meal or snack like the French go√ªter. Xiaochi are not typically cooked in homes nor are they featured prominently on the menus of more formal restaurants (although a few courses of a multi-course banquet might be xiaochi). Instead, they are street food sold in markets at special stalls or small restaurants that specialize in a few or even just one xiaochi. Night markets are especially known for their specialty xiaochi food items. Here, xiaochi are either served as carry-out or sometimes at small tables with stools for seating. Taiwanese food critic Shu Kuo-chih describes xiaochi as \\"food from a street stall, shop or even a restaurant that comes in small portions and could never be considered a 'square meal' on its own. In New York, he says, 'hot dogs or nachos could be xiaochi.' Dim sum? Definitely.\\"David Frazier. \\"Man of the Streets.\\" Xiaochi are highly local and, in some cases, one city's markets, or even one particular market or restaurant, can become famous for a particular type of food. The city will often become known for that food and the city name be used as an identifier or an attribution of quality (e.g. Chengdu xiaochi in Beijing). Specific types of xiaochi will often change from year to year with passing fads but staples persist. Xiaochi can often form part of the fourth meal of the day, the xiaoye (ÂÆµÂ§ú; \\"supper\\" or \\"midnight snack\\"), a small late evening meal. Even smaller pre-made side dishes (usually accompanying alcohol or a more substantial meal) are known as xiaocai (Â∞èËèú, \\"small dish\\"). Types of xiaochi Sesame Sauce Noodle(È∫ªÈÜ¨È∫µ), a street noodle dish from Beijing cuisine. Xiaochi occur in large and eclectic varieties throughout ethnically Chinese areas throughout the world. Typically, they are most commonly served by outlets ranging from market stalls to teahouses and restaurants in areas of heavy pedestrian traffic: for example near temples and markets in the commercial centres of towns and cities. The so-called \\"four great xiaochi clusters\\" of mainland China are all based around temples:Xinhua, ÈóªÂêçÂÖ®ÂõΩÁöÑÂõõÂ§ßÂ∞èÂêÉÁæ§ (\\"The four great xiaochi clusters with nationwide fame\\"), 11 September 2006 the Temple to Confucius in Nanjing, the Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou, the City God Temple in Shanghai, and the Fire Temple in Changsha. Traditionally, xiaochi is consumed as a light meal or snack between meals when visiting temples and markets. As a result, they are often self-contained and easily portable. In more modern times, markets have been built where the xiaochi is the main attraction. For example, at Beijing's Jiumen Xiaochi (‰πùÈó®Â∞èÂêÉ) market built in 2006, outlets include \\"Qian's glutinous rice cake, Wei's cheese juice, Li's flour tea, pouch-shaped baked wheaten cake, Yue Sheng Zhai's stewed marinated beef, Ma's water-boiled sheep head mutton, and Bai's jellied bean curd... Feng's boiled beef stomach, and Chen's boiled pork's small intestines and lungs with baked cake.\\"\\"Snack resurrection.\\" at ChinaDaily.com.cn. 13 July 2006. Retrieved 20 June 2008. Many larger towns and cities feature a great variety of xiaochi, and many xiaochi are found uniquely in only one or a few cities. Examples of xiaochi include: * soup-based dishes: soup noodles, rice vermicelli, wontons, tofu skin wraps, gluten wraps, tangyuan (rice dough balls); * pastries: jiaozi dumplings, baozi and mantou (steamed buns), xiaolongbao, fried pancakes, Tujia shaobing (\\"Tujia pizza\\" or \\"Chinese pizza\\"), zongzi, Ludagun; * meat: salt- cured duck, steamed chicken, cold soy pork, sheep offal; * desserts: rice flour cakes, sachima, tanghulu. Xiaochi in Taiwan Keelung Miaokou Night Market-style Taiwanese tempura Portuguese-style egg tarts, Middle-Eastern- derived shawarma, American steaks, Japanese udon noodles, and many mainland Chinese foods have all factored prominently in Taiwanese xiaochi. As Taiwan has become increasingly affluent, xiaochi have become an important part of the culinary culture. Taiwanese xiaochi can be divided into several categories including poultry, meat, fish and seafood, rice and noodle dishes, tofu and vegetarian dishes, pastries, sauces and pickles, and beverages.

They take $3000 of the money that has already been raised to bet on an illegal car race that Dylan is convinced he will win. Dylan doesn't win the race, and in order to get their money back, he is forced to double down on an impossible race against the clock that only the town legend has ever accomplished. The film ends with a spectacular stunt as car and driver jump through the goalposts during a football game between two local high schools, Apollo and Cathedral. Cast *Matt Lattanzi as Dylan Malone *Loryn Locklin as Melissa Hanson *Grant Heslov as Nevil *Billy Morrissette as Monkey *Geoffrey Lewis as Mr. Johnson *M. Emmet Walsh as- Johnny Phatmun Production The film was shot on location throughout St. Cloud, Minnesota (where Sommers grew up), and at Cathedral High School and Apollo High School, which Sommers attended. It was funded independently and had a budget of $800,000. The film was Sommers's directorial debut and was written by him. When production finished, the studio that had promised to distribute the movie had gone out of business, and it was eventually released by MCA Inc. in July 1989. The movie did not fare well at the box office, grossing only $3686 in its domestic run, but it made $7 million overseas. The movie featured local residents cast as extras in the production and many of the hot-rods, classic cars and muscle cars featured in the race scenes were owned by central Minnesota residents. Sommers went on to achieve success directing the 1999 film The Mummy and its 2001 sequel The Mummy Returns. Soundtrack The film's soundtrack was performed and recorded by Tangerine Dream. It is their 20th soundtrack album and 50th album overall. All tracks were composed by Edgar Froese and Paul Haslinger.

Husayn ibn Ali reached Al Hajir from the direction of Al Rumma, he handed over his message to Qays in reply to the letter he received from Muslim ibn Aqil regarding the people of Kufa who expressed their desire to support Husayn ibn Ali against the Yazid, their readiness came after they paid allegiance to Muslim ibn Aqil.  Husayn ibn Ali's letter  Husayn ibn Ali in his letter to the people of Kufa which he dispatched with Qays ibn Musahir composed the following message : \\"Muslim ibn Aqil's letter reached me. In it, he informs me of your consensus to support us and to demand our rights; therefore, I plead to Allah to enable us to do what is good and to reward you with the greatest of His rewards. I have come to you from Mecca on the eighth of Thul-Hijjah; so, if my messenger reaches you, maintain your stand, for I shall reach you in a few days.\\" By the time Muslim's message reached Husayn ibn Ali about the betrayal he suffered, Husayn ibn Ali had already sent Qays with the reply of that message about his intention to arrive there. However within few days Muslim was captured and then killed by the order of Kufa Governor Ubaydullah ibn Ziyad.  Arrest in Al Qadisiyya  Qays was captured in Al Qadissiya by the soldiers of Al Hasin ibn Nimir al Tamimi on his way to Kufa and was thus taken into court of Ibn Ziyad. Qays ibn Musahir was asked about the letter of Husayn ibn Ali, which before being captured he had shredded or eaten. Ibn Ziyad was curious to know the contents of Husayn ibn Ali's letter, he asked Qays for what did he shred the letter which Qays replied, in order to hide its contents.  Ibn Ziyad's condition and Qays's death  When Qays refused to reveal the contents of Husayn ibn Ali's letter to Ibn Ziyad. He then asked Qays to raise on the pulpit and praise Yazid and curse Husayn ibn Ali in front of everyone. If done as directed, Ibn Ziyad promised to spare his life if done otherwise Ibn Ziyad threatened to kill him. Ibn Ziyad put forth his condition in the following sentence: Qays ascended the pulpit as directed by Ibn Ziyad and started his speech in the following manner: At the very same time Qays praised and glorified God and blessed the Mohammad and his Progeny and was consistently imploring God's blessings on Ali ibn Abi Talib, on al-Hasan ibn Ali and al-Husayn ibn Ali. Also Qays cursed Ibn Ziyad his father and all Umayyads, some accounts say he even cursed Yazid. At this Ibn Ziyad turned furious and ordered his men to throw Qays from above the rooftop of his palace. When Qays was thrown likewise his bones got crushed and Qays succumbed to his injuries. Some historians have recorded that Qays did not die immediately, so Abd al Malik Ibn Umayr al-Lakhmi slit his throat. When blamed, he replied that he wanted to put an end to Qays's suffering.

The Jackson Street Boys also have a presence in other U.S. cities. However, there are members of the gang who are students in middle schools and high schools in addition to their Chinatown presence. The gang was involved in many criminal acts including the burning of a Chinese restaurant sparked by the owner's debt to the gang. Although the suspects were arrested, they were soon released. Formation The Jackson Boys gang was the successor to the Wo Hop To Triad which ruled the streets of San Francisco's Chinatown in the 1980s and early 1990s. The Jackson Street Boys was founded by three brothers, Bobby Tsan, Johnny Tsan and Tommy Tsan, who were former Wah Ching members who had defected to the Wo Hop To after the Wo Hop To forced the Wah Ching out of San Francisco. After law enforcement cracked down on the Wo Hop To around 1992, the Jackson Street Boys resumed what a SFPD officer described in 2000 as \\"the same stuff on a smaller scale and without the same visibility\\", including extortion of local merchants and operating gambling dens. Criminal activities Unlike many other Asian street gangs which are composed primarily of American-born or Americanized Asians, the Jackson Boys has a mix of foreign-born and American-born members. The gang is unique in that though some members engage in low-level street crime like stealing cars or drug-dealing, other members also engage in sophisticated money-making schemes such as credit-card fraud, racketeering, illegal gambling, and other white-collar crimes. In the gang's history, there have also been instances of the gang branching out into other cities, such as nearby Oakland, and even as far as places like Seattle, Washington and Denver, Colorado. These developments have been temporary, however, and their center of operations remains San Francisco. One of the more noted crimes that the gang was involved in occurred on June 30, 1995. One faction of the Jackson Street Boys opened fire on another on a busy Chinatown street, Stockton Street, during the daytime. Seven innocent bystanders were struck, including a pregnant woman. Three males, ages 18, 16, and 14, were arrested in connection with the shooting. Jackson Boys were also the primary trafficker of illegal fireworks back when fireworks were blatantly sold on the streets of Chinatown.

Shubael Dummer (16 February 1636 ‚Äì 25 January 1692) was an American Congregational church minister who was killed in the Candlemas Massacre in York, Maine. Described as a man of \\"beautiful Christian character\\", Dummer founded the First Parish Congregational Church of York, the oldest church congregation in the U.S. state of Maine. Family and education Dummer was born at Roxbury on 16 February 1636, the son of Richard Dummer (1589‚Äì1679) and his first wife Mary Jane Mason. Richard was a settler, who had arrived at Boston from England in May 1632 with Mary, and was an associate of the radical Puritan malcontent Stephen Bachiler. Mary was a follower of Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson, leading to her and Richard becoming banished to Boston. Soon after the birth of Shubael, Mary became ill and died in February 1636. Following the death of his wife, Richard returned to England. It is not known whether or not he was accompanied by his infant son; Richard returned to New England in May 1638 on board the Bevis and Shubael is not listed as one of the passengers. Shubael was brought up under the ministry of Rev. Thomas Parker, one of the most eminent scholars and Christians among the founders of New England, who educated him and prepared him for admission to college. He went up to Harvard, from where he graduated in 1656 at the age of twenty. Shortly afterwards at Salisbury, he married Lydia Alcock, daughter of John and Elizabeth Alcock. Richard remarried (to Frances Burr) in 1643 and their first son, Jeremiah, was born on 14 September. He was to become the first American- born silversmith. Jeremiah's sons included William, who became Governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, and Jeremiah, who was involved in the foundation of Yale University. Ministry The meeting house at York At the age of 24, he became a preacher in Salisbury, where he remained for two years, before settling in York in 1662. In 1660, the town of Salisbury tried unsuccessfully to obtain his services as minister. Dummer was made a Freeman of Massachusetts Colony on 3 May 1665. The meeting house at York was built in 1667 on \\"land given to the use of the ministry\\", part of it a glebe granted by Governor Edward Godfrey for the maintenance of a \\"house for the worship of God and endowment of minister.\\" It was situated at what is now Lindsay Road close to Barrells Millpond. On 3 December 1672, he was ordained to the Ministry and settled over the church at York, on the recommendation of Richard Banks, his brother-in-law, and Edward Rishworth. At his ordination, he preached a sermon from Psalm based on the lines: \\"Return, O Lord, and visit this vine\\". On 7 July 1674, his father made over to him lands at Byfield. The following year, he was listed as administrator of the estate of his father-in-law, John Alcock, together with his brothers-in-law, Joseph Alcock and Richard Banks. At this time, the people of the church were poor with the early settlers in the town being adventurers; the town had had no one preacher for any length of time and was seen as \\"an asylum for excommunicated and itinerant ministers\\". According to the writer Cotton Mather, Dummer \\"spent very much of his own patrimony to subsist among the people\\". In 1690, he went to Boston to secure help, for at that time things were hard-going for the people of Maine and southern New Hampshire. The parish records were lost when the church was destroyed by fire, and consequently there is little detailed information about Dummer's thirty years at York. Dummer is known, however, to have officiated at the wedding of James Smith of Berwick and Martha Mills at Wells in June 1677. Despite his family advising him to find a safer ministry, Dummer continued to support the people of the town through their various trials and sufferings on account of the Indian wars and urged the townspeople to maintain their ground, and not allow their homes and farms to be destroyed by the enemy, as had some of the surrounding settlements. According to Cotton Mather: > Though solicited with many temptations to leave his place, when the clouds > grew thick and dark in the Indian hostilities, and was like to break upon > it, he chose, rather, with a paternal affection to stay amongst those who > had been so many of them converted and edified by his ministry. After Dummer's death, Mather gave this eulogy: > Our Dummer, the minister of York, was one of whom, for his exemplary > holiness, humbleness, modesty, industry and fidelity, the world was not > worthy. He was a gentleman well descended, well tempered, and well educated > . . . He might have taken for the coat of arms, the same that the holy > martyr Hooper did prophetically, - a lamb in a flaming bush, with rays from > heaven shining of it. Death On 25 January 1692, a band of Abenaki, together with several French Canadians, came down from the North, making their way on snow shoes over the deep snow. The attackers waited until daybreak when they posted themselves at the door of each dwelling. Dummer was one of the first to be killed as he was about to mount his horse to visit a sick parishioner. The invaders stripped and mutilated his corpse; his friends, who escaped by being in the garrisoned houses, or on the west side of the river, later found his body near his own door, \\"naked and in his blood, with his face to the ground\\". Capt. John Flood, who had come with the militia from Portsmouth, found on his arrival that \\"the greatest part of the whole town was burned and robbed,\\" with nearly 50 killed and another 100 captured. He reported that Rev. Dummer was \\"barbarously murthered, stript naked, cut and mangled by these sons of Beliall.\\" Before the invaders marched off their hostages, they sent back the youngest children and the oldest women. Dummer's widow, Lydia, was among those freed, but she shuttled back and forth to the raiders' camp so often, begging for the release of her infant son, that she was taken with the rest of the hostages. The captives were marched off \\"through snows and hardships among those dragons of the desert\\" where Lydia also died. On the first Sabbath after they started on their journey, an Abenaki, dressed in the clothes stripped from Dummer's dead body, \\"paraded himself before them with mock dignity, and in derision of a Puritan minister ‚Äì a devil as an angel of light\\". It is not known what became of the boy. Obituary Notes :A. Some sources give her name as \\"Alcott\\", although this is believed to be a simple discrepancy in spelling. Several, older, sources claim that his wife was Mary, the daughter of Edward Rishworth. :B. Banks was married to Elizabeth Alcock, sister of Lydia. He was later to be killed in the January 1692 massacre.

Both versions also use models of both genders, as the hosts of the two versions are female. The ABC version featured six contestants, three competing in each of the two Showcase Showdowns. The winners of each Showcase Showdown competed in the Showcase portion. Initially, the Australian format (1981 onwards) was used, involving the alternate guessing of the price of the showcase and the winner rearranging the Showcase items in correct order from cheapest to the most expensive. The more familiar American format was used later in the ABC version's run. This version aired only on Sundays. The ABS-CBN version initially involved only four contestants, two competing in each of the two Showcase Showdowns. The winners of those two Showdowns then competed in a third, one-spin-only Showdown to determine who competed in the Showcase round. This round used the British/European format, involving the choice of a range (two each of , three squares, and one each of ) and bidding on one Showcase to be within the chosen range without going over the actual price. Later, the show involved only three contestants competing in one Showdown to determine who played in the Showcase round. In addition, each contestant was partnered with two other players who won money if the main contestant won a pricing game.Kris Aquino's The Price is Right goes live starting this Monday retrieved via www.pep.ph 03-07-2011 Initially airing on weekdays, it was moved to Saturdays due to its low ratings.

Presentation Common symptoms of the disease are weakness and atrophy in the distal muscles of the lower limbs which progresses to the hands and arms, then to the trunk, neck and face. Respiratory impairment often follows.  Genetics There are three major types of inheritance for this disease: Autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and de novo. * The most severe form is autosomal recessive and it also has the earliest onset. It usually involves all three muscle tissues and leads to cardiac and respiratory failure as well as intestinal obstruction. * Autosomal Dominant inheritance shows a later onset and slower progression. It usually involves only one or two of the muscle tissues. * De novo diseases occur when a new mutation arises in the person that was not inherited through either parent. This form has a wide range of symptoms and varies depending on the mutation made. Pathophysiology The sarcomeres become misaligned and result in the disorganization of muscle fibers. This mutation also results in muscle cell death by apoptosis and necrosis. The muscle cell may also be disorganized because the aggregates may interrupt other filament structures and/or normal cellular function. Desminopathies are very rare diseases and only 60 patients have been diagnosed, however this number probably does not accurately represent the population due to frequent mis or under diagnosis. Diagnosis Desminopathies are diagnosed by genetic analysis. Because mutations in several further genes might be pathogenic for skeletal and cardiac myopathies, gene panels or whole exome sequence analysis are mostly used. Sanger sequencing is consequently used to verify NGS-data. Treatment There is currently no cure for the disease but treatments to help the symptoms are available.  Prognosis  Prognosis strongly depends on which subtype of disease it is. Some are deadly in infancy but most are late onset and mostly manageable.

A riparian species, cottonwoods are a conspicuous indicator of water at or near the surface of the ground where they occur in the desert. History Long used by Native Americans, Spaniards and Mexican travelers on the Sonora Road; the Alamo Mocho Well was first used by American soldiers of Kearny and Cooke passing through the desert in 1847 during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. If the wells had been near cottonwood trees when they first received their Spanish name the trees were cut down long before the Americans arrived. The diversion of the Southern Emigrant Trail and the later stage road south of the Mexican Border was due to the Algodones Dunes, extensive sand dunes located west of Fort Yuma and northwest for over 50 miles that were impassable to wheeled vehicles of the era. The route followed the Colorado River south from Fort Yuma to beyond Pilot Knob where it turned west. Here the route passed south of the dunes, following the direction of ephemeral sloughs that fed the Alamo River to the south of the route, made by the variable overflowing of the Colorado River in the spring. When it overflowed this inundation flowed west on the sloughs of Alamo River to the vicinity of Alamo Mocho Well and via the Paradones River to the volcanic lake southeast of Cerro Prieto and down the New River, up to 60 miles west of the Colorado to the vicinity of Indian Wells. In years of extraordinary flooding or if the Colorado changed course down these channels it might flow north, to the Salton Sink. Following these spring flood events, water that remained in these channels formed ponds and lakes, where water percolated into the soil before they dried out. Here wells could be sunk to obtain water even in years the channels were not flooded, in the otherwise almost waterless desert during the rest of the year. Cottonwoods, fond of water, are found along the length of the lower Colorado River and in these sloughs also. Alamo Mocho Station was located at such a small shallow lake basin, along the course of the Alamo River, 38 miles east of Indian Wells Station, and 22 miles west of the Cooke's Wells Station. At first it provided the only water between Indian Wells on the New River and Cooke's Wells. After the mail route began to be traveled, improvements were made in the route of the road to follow the course of the river further south, providing new wells and stations between Indian Wells Station and Alamo Mocho Station at New River Station and between Alamo Mocho and Cooke's Wells Stations, at Gardner's Wells Station and Salt or Seven Wells. In a report on his march to Fort Yuma in October, 1861, Lieutenant Colonel Joseph R. West, marched east along the mail route describes Alamo Mocho on October 31, six months after the stage line abandoned the route: :The Alamo is another old deserted mail station; there is a well thirty feet deep, affording a supply of good water. Animals can now make use of a lagoon, half a mile southwest from the house. Within 350 yards of the house the road to Fort Yuma branches off to the left; the right-hand fork leads to the Mariposa ferry, thirty-six miles, and down the Colorado thirty miles from Fort Yuma. That route can be used to advantage by any one acquainted with the water lagoons, which are in thickets off the road and hard to find by strangers.THE WAR OF THE REBELLION: A COMPILATION OF THE OFFICIAL RECORDS OF THE UNION AND CONFEDERATE ARMIES.

It codified a lay and ecclesiastical agreement between the Count of Foix, Roger-Bernard III, and the Bishop of Urgell, Pere d'Urtx, establishing their joint sovereignty over the territory of Andorra. The par√©age established the system of condominium in Andorra, placing it under suzerainty of both lords. This system was later ratified in 1993 by the signing of the Constitution of Andorra. A second par√©age was signed on 6 November 1288, which supplemented and addressed a number of clauses in the first par√©age. Together, these two par√©ages comprised the first basic law of Andorra, and were the nation's most important constitutional documents until the ratification of the Constitution in 1993. Following a series of marriages, the titles of the Count of Foix, including his co-lordship over Andorra, passed to the French monarch when Henry IV of B√©arn, Count of Foix and Navarre, became King of France. Henry IV was therefore the first French king to also be Co-Prince of Andorra, a title which would eventually pass to today's president. With the Constitution in 1993, the system of government was then modified to provide for a parliamentary democracy, in which the rulers remained as ceremonial heads of state. There is only one copy of each of the par√©ages in existence. The copy of the first par√©age is kept at the Arxiu Hist√≤ric Nacional in Andorra. Its original, which was kept at the Archives of the Ch√¢teau de Foix, in Ari√®ge, is thought to have been destroyed during a fire in the 20th century. The second par√©age is held at the Arxiu Dioces√† i Capitular d'Urgell, in La Seu d'Urgell, Spain. The original was kept in the town of Tournai, and was destroyed with the rest of the archives when the town was bombed in 1940 during World War II.

The northwestern part of the district lies the basin of the Polist River, with both the Polist and its major right tributary, the Porusya, having their sources within the district. The Polist flows into the Lovat River and thus belongs to the basin of the Neva. The Loknya River, a left tributary of the Lovat, makes up a stretch of the border with Loknyansky District. Some areas in the south of the district are in the basin of the Loknya. The western part of the district belongs to the basin of the Velikaya River. The rivers in the northwest of the district drain into the Sorot, a major right tributary of the Velikaya, and into the Lsta, a left tributary of the Sorot.

The governorates were abolished as well, and the district became a part of Pskov Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were also abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On January 29, 1935, the district was transferred to Kalinin Oblast, and on February 5 of the same year, Bezhanitsky District became a part of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Kalinin Oblast, one of the okrugs abutting the state boundaries of the Soviet Union. On May 11, 1937, the district was transferred to Opochka Okrug. On May 4, 1938, the district was directly subordinated to Kalinin Oblast. Between 1941 and 1944, Bezhanitsky District was occupied by German troops. On August 22, 1944, the district was transferred to newly established Velikiye Luki Oblast. On October 2, 1957, Velikiye Luki Oblast was abolished, and the district was transferred to Pskov Oblast. On August 28, 1958, Krasny Luch was granted work settlement status, and on August 7, 1961, Bezhanitsy followed. On August 1, 1927, Chikhachyovsky District was established as well, with the administrative center in the selo of Chikhachyovo. It included parts of former Novorzhevsky and Porkhovsky Uyezds. The district was a part of Pskov Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On January 1, 1932, the district was abolished and split between Dedovichsky and Bezhanitsky Districts. Another district established on August 1, 1927 was Kudeversky District with the administrative center in the selo of Kudever. It included parts of former Novorzhevsky Uyezd. The district was a part of Pskov Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On September 20, 1931, Kudeversky District was abolished and merged into Novorzhevsky District. On March 5, 1935, it was re-established as a part of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Kalinin Oblast; on May 11, 1937, the district was transferred to Opochka Okrug. On August 22, 1944, the district was transferred to Velikiye Luki Oblast. On October 2, 1957, Velikiye Luki Oblast was abolished, and Kudeversky District was transferred to Pskov Oblast. On January 14, 1958, Kudeversky District was abolished and split between Bezhanitsky, Novorzhevsky, Opochetsky, and Pustoshkinsky Districts. On June 1, 1936, Ashevsky District with the administrative center in the selo of Chikhachyovo was established. It included parts of Bezhanitsky and Loknyansky Districts. The district was a part of Velikiye Luki Okrug of Kalinin Oblast. On May 11, 1937, the district was transferred to Opochka Okrug. On May 4, 1938, the district was directly subordinated to Kalinin Oblast. Between 1941 and 1944, Ashevsky District was occupied by German troops. On August 23, 1944, it was included into newly established Pskov Oblast. On February 1, 1963, the district was abolished and merged into Bezhanitsky District. Economy Industry The largest industrial enterprise of the district is Krasny Luch Glass-Works, which is one of the oldest glass-works. The works produces light glass, consumer goods, and decorative glass items. It is located in the urban-type settlement of Krasny Luch. Agriculture Agriculture forms the basis of the district's economy and employs over 22% of the population. The main product is dairy, with growing and processing of flax also being important. Transportation The railway connecting St. Petersburg and Vitebsk crosses the district from north to south. Bezhanitsy is connected by road with Porkhov, Velikiye Luki (via Loknya), and Novorzhev. There are also local roads with bus traffic originating from Bezhanitsy. Culture and recreation The district contains four cultural heritage monuments of federal significance and additionally twenty-two objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. The federally protected monuments are two churches and two archeological sites. The major places of interest in the district are: *Philosophovs Historical and Cultural Center, placed in the noble family estate of the Philosophovs (late 19th century) *St. Nicholas Church, 1822, in the village of Dvortsy *Church of the Tikhvin Mother of God, 1799‚Äì1807, in the village of Dobryvichi; *an ancient settlement site, first half of the 2d millennium AD, the village of Gorodok, northeast of Lake Tsevlo *an ancient settlement site, 10-15th centuries, southeast of the village of Podorzhevka References Notes Sources  Districts of Pskov Oblast States and territories established in 1927 ","title":"Bezhanitsky District"},{"id":"30045543","text":"William Edgar Reeder (February 20, 1922 ‚Äì March 12, 2001) was a pitcher in Major League Baseball.

She began uploading videos of herself performing original songs on YouTube soon after releasing her debut album Sitting in Chairs in 2007. Her first videos were simple one takes with just a guitar, but they soon progressed to layered harmonies and accompaniment, usually with O'Connell playing all of the instruments herself. Her organic songs inspired from earnest reckonings and reflection are delivered in a musical style that combines elements of folk music, bluegrass, country and americana. She has independently released four solo albums, and two EP as a duo with Nataly Dawn under the group name My Terrible Friend. Four years later, she returned with ‚ÄòDetails‚Äô released in February, 2018. It was described as \\"an album as ambitious as it is strident in its solitary ruminations on love lost and circadian bloom.\\" Biography O'Connell's music career began after coming across her father's old guitar in the basement one day when she was thirteen. After learning a few chords from her dad and messing around with the guitar for a while, she got serious about playing and began taking lessons, writing her first song by the age of fifteen. After spending some time playing coffeehouse shows, in 2007 O'Connell went to Saxon Recording in Rochester, New York at the suggestion of a friend and recorded her debut album Sitting in Chairs. She recorded the entire album acoustic in one day. Shortly after releasing Sitting in Chairs O'Connell began attending Binghamton University. Throughout her first year she continued to write and perform. She performed many shows with her best friend Julia Nunes. In late 2008, she decided to leave school and pursue music full-time. She then began recording her follow-up album The Shakes, which was released in early 2009. During the summer of 2009, O'Connell met Jack Conte and Nataly Dawn of Pomplamoose when they came to New York to produce Nunes' I Think You Know EP. After deciding that she wanted a change of scenery in early 2010, O'Connell moved to Rohnert Park, California, where she moved in with Conte and Dawn. A few months after moving to California she and Dawn began a collaboration called My Terrible Friend. The duo recorded an EP titled Room for Ghosts in their home studio and released it through iTunes and their Myspace page on July 7, 2010. On July 20, 2010 O'Connell and Dawn were featured on the YouTube homepage for Music Tuesday, both individually and as My Terrible Friend. YouTube and shows outside of the US Though O'Connell's fanbase was initially centered on the local area where she performed, the use of social media such as Myspace and YouTube videos exposed her music to a much wider audience. Through these sites she has gained fans in many countries and, as evidenced by the comments on her Myspace page and YouTube channel, given them a forum to request shows throughout America and in their respective countries. Although most of her shows have been in America, she has played a few outside of the country. In April 2009 she was scheduled to play two free shows in London, but was detained by Customs and forced to cancel them. Customs agents allowed her to leave and stay the night with a friend, but deported her the next day. On November 8, 2009 she played with Pomplamoose at the wedding of Take That member Mark Owen and English actress Emma Ferguson in Cawdor Church, Scotland. Ferguson, a fan of Rufus Wainwright, discovered Nataly Dawn's cover of Wainwright's song \\"Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk\\" and invited Dawn to play the song at the wedding. She then discovered Pomplamoose and O'Connell and Dawn's \\"The Daylight Here\\" and invited Jack Conte and O'Connell to play as well. On September 3, 2010 O'Connell, Dawn, and Julia Nunes played a free show for students of Dawson College at the Le National Bar in Montreal. The show was hosted by the Dawson Student Union. Each played solo sets and in various combinations. It was O'Connell and Dawn's first performance as My Terrible Friend. Mountain Stage Newsong Contest In September 2010 O'Connell was chosen as the West Regional Winner of the 2010 Mountain Stage Newsong Contest. On October 22, 2010 she joined eleven other finalists from across America and Canada at Arts World Financial Center's Wintergarden in New York City for the Award Round performance competition and an opportunity to record an EP with Grammy winning producer Jacquire King. Pledgemusic On December 14, 2010, O'Connell announced that she was raising money to record a new album and was working with Pledgemusic in order to give fans an opportunity to help fund studio time, with the goal of being in the studio sometime in January 2011. In return for pledging O'Connell decided to include personalized merchandise ranging from autographed CDs and T-shirts, handwritten lyrics, and hand-drawn artwork to house concerts, her personal iPod filled with music, and even grocery shopping or mini-golf with the pledger when she comes to their city for a show. The project was set for a sixty-day pledge period, however, fan pledges exceeded the target amount in the first 24 hours, making it the fastest Pledgemusic project ever to reach its goal. One week later she added more of the incentives that sold out quickly as well as new incentives like the harmonicas she uses for her videos and albums, a Photoshop vacation photo with the pledger, and a volleyball painted with the pledger's face in the style of \\"Wilson\\" from the movie Cast Away, joking that her New Year's resolution was to make progressively weirder arts and crafts. The project raised 268% of the original goal by the time it concluded on February 14, 2011. Discography Sitting in Chairs O'Connell's debut album was recorded at Saxon Recording in Rochester, New York in early 2007. Sitting in Chairs was recorded in just one day, single-tracked with an acoustic guitar. Track List #Sitting in Chairs #Levers and Gears #Good Intentions #My Equations #I'm All Talk #Chimney Smoke #Just Be #All the Perching Crows #Somewhere in Between #There Will Be The Shakes O'Connell's second album was recorded in late 2008 in Rochester, New York at GFI Music. It was released in early 2009. Unlike her previous album, The Shakes features accompaniment, including horns, strings, and piano. Track List #From Chambers, Slow #Chicken Wire #The Pilot #Things I Panic About #I Don't Mind #Bystander #Oncoming Traffic #1988 #Sweet Lament #Tangled Up Kites Quitters On January 25, 2012, O'Connell announced via her website that she would be releasing a new album on March 2. Quitters was produced by O'Connell and engineered & mixed by Oz Fritz at Prairie Sun Studios in Cotati, California. Track list #Every Space #I Will Burn You Down #I Belong To You #Things Are Alright #If Found/Gravity #What Breaks (and What Doesn't) #Maybe True Stories #The Same Things #In The Next Room #White Noise Room for Ghosts In the summer of 2010 O'Connell collaborated with her roommate Nataly Dawn of Pomplamoose and the duo released Room for Ghosts as My Terrible Friend in July 2010. The five track EP was recorded in their home studio and includes three original songs, as well as covers of \\"Diamonds and Gold\\" by Tom Waits and \\"Holy Roller Novocaine\\" by Kings of Leon. Track list #When I Decide #Diamonds and Gold #Holy Roller Novocaine #The Daylight Here #Dying to Live Singles, covers, and guest appearances Between albums O'Connell has released individual original songs and covers, some as both downloads and videos and some as videos only. Her cover of \\"House of the Rising Sun\\" was featured on the promos for American Horror Story's third season, Coven. On November 19, 2009 she won the Grand Opinion video contest held by singer/songwriter AM with her video cover of his song \\"Grand Opinion\\" and was featured the next day on the Filter magazine website for the contest win. She has also made guest appearances in songs and videos with other YouTube artists. Though she generally uses traditional instruments in her songs, O'Connell has sometimes used unconventional means when recording, including waterglasses, a metal tool cabinet, kicks to a garage door, a tennis racket covered in change, and even a deck of playing cards.

The equations For the case of countable state space we put i,j in place of x,y. Kolmogorov forward equations read : \\\\frac{\\\\partial P_{ij}}{\\\\partial t}(s;t) = \\\\sum_k P_{ik}(s;t) A_{kj}(t) , where A(t) is the transition rate matrix (also known as generator matrix), while Kolmogorov backward equations are : \\\\frac{\\\\partial P_{ij}}{\\\\partial s}(s;t) = -\\\\sum_k A_{ik}(s) P_{kj}(s;t) The functions P_{ij}(s;t) are continuous and differentiable in both time arguments. They represent the probability that the system that was in state i at time s jumps to state j at some later time t > s . The continuous quantities A_{ij}(t) satisfy : A_{ij}(t) = \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\partial P_{ij}}{\\\\partial u}(t;u)\\\\right]_{u=t}, \\\\quad A_{jk}(t) \\\\ge 0,\\\\ j e k, \\\\quad \\\\sum_k A_{jk}(t) =0. Background The original derivation of the equations by Kolmogorov starts with the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation (Kolmogorov called it Fundamental equation) for time-continuous and differentiable Markov processes on a finite, discrete state space. In this formulation, it is assumed that the probabilities P(i,s;j,t) are continuous and differentiable functions of t > s . Also adequate limit properties for the derivatives are assumed. Feller Feller, Willy (1940) \\"On the Integro-Differential Equations of Purely Discontinuous Markoff Processes\\", Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, 48 (3), 488-515 derives the equations under slightly different conditions, starting with the concept of purely discontinuous Markov process and formulating them for more general state spaces. Feller proves the existence of solutions of probabilistic character to the Kolmogorov forward equations and Kolmogorov backward equations under natural conditions. Relation with the generating function Still in the discrete state case, letting s=0 and assuming that the system initially is found in state i, The Kolmogorov forward equations describe an initial value problem for finding the probabilities of the process, given the quantities A_{jk}(t). We write p_k(t)= P_{ik}(0;t) where \\\\sum_{k}p_k(t) = 1, then : \\\\frac{d p_k}{dt}(t) = \\\\sum_j A_{jk}(t) p_j(t);\\\\quad p_k(0)=\\\\delta_{ik}, \\\\qquad k=0,1,\\\\dots . For the case of a pure death process with constant rates the only nonzero coefficients are A_{j,j-1}=\\\\mu,\\\\ j\\\\ge 1. Letting : \\\\Psi(x,t) = \\\\sum_k x^k p_k(t),\\\\quad the system of equations can in this case be recast as a partial differential equation for {\\\\Psi}(x,t) with initial condition \\\\Psi (x,0)=x^i. After some manipulations, the system of equations reads,Bailey, Norman T.J. (1990) The Elements of Stochastic Processes with Applications to the Natural Sciences, Wiley.

The name is a reference to the original liberal-democratic Party of Popular Freedom. The party is strongly critical of Putin's regime. Its stated goal is to return Russia to the path of democracy and restore respect for the Constitution. It is also an associate member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party. The party has been formed on the basis of a coalition including four organisations: * Democratic Choice (led by Vladimir Milov) * Republican Party of Russia (led by Vladimir Ryzhkov) * Russian People's Democratic Union (led by Mikhail Kasyanov) * Solidarity (represented by Boris Nemtsov) A number of Solidarity members have decided not to join the People's Freedom Party, including Garry Kasparov and his United Civil Front, saying that they do not want to participate in unfree elections and waste resources attempting to register an opposition party, which, in their opinion, is impossible. They are also on bad terms with some key members of the Democratic Choice. In 2011, the European Court of Human Rights that ruled the refusal to register the Republican Party of Russia was unlawful. Since 5 May 2012, the Justice Ministry has restored the state registration of the Republican Party of Russia. On 16 June 2012 on 15th congress of the Republican Party of Russia, PARNAS members joined to RPR and the united democratic opposition party was renamed to Republican Party of Russia ‚Äì People's Freedom Party (RPR-PARNAS).  Chronology  * On 16 September 2010, the coalition of four movements was created under the name \\"For Russia without Lawlessness and Corruption\\". * On 9 October 2010, the coalition held its first rally in Moscow. * On 13 December 2010, the party held its founding congress. * On 28 March 2011, the party released its report Putin. Corruption and started to collect funds for its publication. * On 16 April 2011, the party held rallies in Moscow and other cities. * On 23 May 2011, representatives of the party submitted to the Justice Ministry the required documents for its registration. Regional offices had been established in 53 regions of Russia, and the number of members had reached 46.158. * On 22 June 2011, the party was denied registration. * On 23 June, the co-chairmen of the party held a press conference in Moscow. They stated that the Duma elections of December 2011 will be illegitimate without the People‚Äôs Freedom Party on the ballot list and that they intended to organize a broad protest campaign. * 24 June, the President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev commented on the refusal to register the party: \\"Let them remove the 'dead souls', and then they will be registered. No need trying to be registered with irregularities.\\" * On 25 June, the party held a rally in Moscow under the slogan \\"Against tyranny! Against corruption! For fair and free elections!\\" It was attended by over two thousand people. The co-chairmen of the party, Vladimir Ryzhkov, Mikhail Kasyanov, Vladimir Milov and Boris Nemtsov, made speeches saying they considered the refusal of the Justice Ministry illegal and vowed to continue the political struggle. A passionate speech against Putin was delivered by Ilya Yashin. The leader of The Other Russia Eduard Limonov, who came to support the democrats, urged the participants to self-exclude from the voter lists. The actress Natalia Fateyeva informed of her decision to join the party and her example was followed by many others. The participants chanted \\"Elections without opposition is a crime\\" and \\"Down with Putin and Medvedev!\\" * On 2 July 2011, the party held an all-Russia conference in Moscow. The participants took the decision not to make new attempts to register with the Justice Ministry and to appeal the refusal to register the party in court. They declared the upcoming parliamentary elections illegitimate and launched a campaign under the slogan \\"I do not take part in the farce!\\" Boris Nemtsov suggested an active form of protest: \\"to come to the polls with a felt pen and cross over the ballot paper\\". The issue of acceptable forms of party debate was also discussed. In this respect, many participants strongly criticised Democratic Choice, so its leader, Vladimir Milov, temporarily left the hall in protest. * On 28‚Äì29 May 2016 Parnas held primaries, which were won by a majority vote by Vyacheslav Maltsev.http://www.sarinform.ru/news/2016/05/30/154525 –í –ø—Ä–∞–π–º–µ—Ä–∏–∑ \\"–ü–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–∏ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥—ã\\" –ø–æ–±–µ–¥–∏–ª –í—è—á–µ—Å–ª–∞–≤ –ú–∞–ª—å—Ü–µ–≤. –í—á–µ—Ä–∞, 30 –º–∞—è 2016, 11:33 –ü–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–∞.  A suit against Putin  On 16 December 2010 Vladimir Putin in a live television broadcast said that in the 90s Nemtsov, Milov and Ryzhkov \\"dragged a lot of billions along with Berezovsky and those who are now in prison.... They have been pulled away from the manger, they had been spending heavily, and now they want to go back and fill their pockets.\\" In January 2011 Boris Nemtsov, Vladimir Milov and Vladimir Ryzhkov brought the case of Putin's statement before the Moscow City Court, but next month their suit was dismissed. According to the judge Tatiana Adamova, the names of Nemtsov, Milov and Ryzhkov were used by Putin merely as common names to refer to a certain class of politicians.  Report Putin. Corruption  On 28 March 2011 the party released its report Putin. Corruption and started to collect funds from the public for its publication. A special account in Yandex has been opened for this purpose, overseen by a supervisory board of well-known public figures: chief editor of Novaya Gazeta Dmitry Muratov, journalist Oleg Kashin, economist Irina Yasina and writer Oleg Kozyrev. Over a month 1,838,209 roubles were collected. Then the same board held a tender choosing the printing house, which had offered the lowest price for printing of one copy (4.05 roubles). Thus, it will be possible to print 440,000 copies. The distribution of the report began in June 2011. The account remains open, and the fundraising is continuing.

Opened in 1854, it forms part of the Turin‚ÄìMilan and is origin of the lines to Arona, to Alessandria, to Biella, Varallo, Domodossola and Luino, respectively. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. The rain services are operated by Trenitalia, SNCF and Trenord. A second station, the Novara Nord railway station, is located a short distance away, and serves as the terminus of the Saronno‚ÄìNovara railway, which is owned by Trenord. Location Novara railway station is situated at Piazza Garibaldi, at the northeastern edge of the city centre. History The station was opened on 3 July 1854, upon the opening of the Novara‚Äì-Mortara portion of the Arona‚ÄìAlessandria railway. Features The passenger station is equipped with fifteen tracks and passing loops, of which thirteen (10 platform and three loops, and 2 north and 1 south) are numbered for passenger service. Track 1 and the tracks of the first three platforms (2-3, 4-4A-5, and 6-6A-6B-7) are served directly from the subway and have a roof, though not for its entire length. The last three tracks are accessible from the platform of the tracks 6 and 7 with a track level crossing. Tracks 3 and 4 serve the Turin‚ÄìMilan railway, while other tracks are mostly used by trains on the other, terminating, lines. The goods yard is distinctly separated from the passenger station and is linked to the incoming lines by two lines connected in a triangle, starting from one end of the passenger station. This allows the goods yard to receive goods trains without having to occupy sections of line reserved for passenger services. At the end of the goods yard is the Centro Intermodale Merci (CIM), built at the turn of the twenty-first century, while along the track north of the triangle is the new Novara Nord railway station. Finally, the goods yard is linked with the Treno Alta Velocit√† (TAV) by a couple of tracks that are bypassed by the FNM line to Novara Nord. Passenger and train movements The station has about 9.4 million passenger movements each year, making it the seventh busiest Centostazioni station in terms of passenger movements. There are about 350 trains per day, including any Trenitalia train replacement buses. Trains stopping at Novara include TGV, Frecciabianca, Intercity Notte and regional trains, along with line S6 on the Milan suburban rail service. The most important domestic destinations of these trains are Turin, Milan and Venice, but passengers also depart for and arrive from other domestic destinations, such as Genoa, Biella and Vercelli. The main international links are with Paris. Many of the station's passenger movements are arrivals from neighboring cities, with a large presence of students in the morning. However, the predominant component is commuter traffic to Milan, and, to a lesser extent, Turin. This traffic leads to overflowing commuter trains, even though each of them is made up of twelve carriages. Combined with the many and repeated delays, the uncomfortable travelling conditions have led to numerous protest actions, with resonance at the national level. Goods traffic, which is also significant, is characterized by the presence of the CIM and a related rolling highway to northern Europe. Even the passage of goods trains in transit is not negligible. Train services The station is served by the following services: *High speed services (TGV) Paris - Chamb√©ry - Turin - Milan *High speed services (Frecciabianca) Turin - Milan - Brescia - Verona - Vicenza - Padua - Venice - Trieste *Night train (Intercity Notte) Turin - Milan - Parma - Rome - Naples - Salerno *Night train (Intercity Notte) Turin - Milan - Parma - Reggio Emilia - Florence - Rome - Salerno - Lamezia Terme - Reggio di Calabria *Historic train (Treno storico) Milan - Novara - Varallo Sesia *Express services (Regionale Veloce) Turin - Chivasso ‚Äì Vercelli ‚Äì Novara ‚Äì Milan *Regional services (Treno regionale) Chivasso - Vercelli - Novara *Regional services (Treno regionale) Biella San Paolo - Novara *Regional services (Treno regionale) Domodossola - Premosello-Chiovenda - Omegna - Borgomanero - Novara *Regional services (Treno regionale) Arona - Oleggio - Novara *Regional services (Treno regionale) Novara - Mortara - Valenza - Alessandria *Milan Metropolitan services (S6) Novara - Milan - Treviglio See also *History of rail transport in Italy *List of railway stations in Piedmont *Rail transport in Italy *Railway stations in Italy References External links Buildings and structures in Novara Railway stations in Piedmont Railway stations opened in 1854 Milan suburban railway stations ","title":"Novara railway station"},{"id":"30045929","text":"Dra≈æa Vas (; ) is a settlement in the Municipality of Slovenske Konjice in eastern Slovenia.

Nanometric bioceramic can be incorporated into the polymer from which the fabric is manufactured. Bioceramic nanoparticles are added to the fused polymer. Some types of ceramics show thermally-induced photoluminescence, emitting light in the far infrared (FIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. When in contact with the body heat, the thermoluminescence of the fabrics with embedded bioceramic is enhanced. Bioceramics presents high reflection coefficient for the infrared radiation. Method of production One way in which fabrics can be impregnated with ceramic is the process of electrophoretic deposition or EPD in the industry. In this process, nanoceramic particles are put into a solution in which the fabric to be infiltrated will be placed. The solution is then heated to high temperatures and the fabric is placed into the solution. Next, a current is passed through and the nano ceramic particles coat and impregnate the fabric. The pH level as well as the amount of time and amount of current can affect how well the fabric is infiltrated and how it is coated. Other processing methods can be further broken down into what particles will be added. There are two distinct groups: *The SiC group (which contains silicon, carbon as well as additives for oxidation processes). When using this group for the purpose of ceramic- impregnation, the textile must first undergo a treatment. This is usually pyrolytic carbon or BN, which is deposited using a chemical vapor infiltration (CVI). Next, an overlayer of SiC is deposited on the textile using the same method. After this step the matrix of the textile is infiltrated by a slurry made up of SiC particles which can either be put in a polymer or simply molten SiC. This process coats the entirety of the textile. *The oxide group. Oxides commonly used are alumina, silica, mullite, and rare-earth phosphates. The process for impregnation is quite simple: a slurry is prepared with the oxide desired and the textile is placed in it. Again, the slurry can be a molten state or a polymer-based one. There are a few differences between these groups. The SiC group has over twice the fracture strength and thermal conductivity when compared to the oxides group. However, the oxides are more stable in combustion and oxidizing environments. The process by which the textile is impregnated depends on what materials will be used, as well as the intended purpose of that fabric. Uses These fabrics are utilized for thermal, mechanical and electrical applications for a variety of reasons. Ceramic-impregnated fabrics are most importantly used in three main fields: aerospace, electronic, and industrial. In aerospace, the fabrics are used in space shuttles for the exit cone, door seals, micrometeorite shield, gaskets, booster access doors, shuttle tiles, and in the Whipple shield. Ceramic- impregnated fabrics are utilized in aerospace because they have low thermal conductivity and can be fabricated into high temperature thermal insulators. In the electronic industry, the fabrics are used primarily for insulation and seals, because of its low porosity. Ceramic fabric's industrial uses include furnace linings, furnace zone dividers, door seals, tube seals, gaskets, and expansion joints. In addition to being an effective thermal insulator, these fabrics do not shrink or elongate with high temperature changes, making them useful for industrial uses that involve high temperatures.

The Church is situated on the right bank of the ≈†ventoji River. The twin spires of the church, each in height, make the church the tallest in Lithuania. The brightly colored stained glass windows were the creation of Anortƒó Mackelaitƒó, the well known stained glass artist of Lithuania, between 1971 and 1986. History Puntukas stone Anyk≈°ƒçiai was first mentioned in written sources in 1442. The first church built before 1500 was a wooden structure. Following the construction of the Catholic Church, the town was mentioned as a city with Magdeburg rights in 1516. The church was destroyed by fire in 1566 and 1671, but quickly rebuilt. The decaying wooden structure was replaced by a brick church, built in 1765. An accompanying white four-storey bell tower was completed in 1823. Following the construction of the narrow gauge railway line between Panevƒó≈æys and ≈†venƒçionƒóliai in the 19th century, the parish was re-developed and the church was re-built over a ten-year period between 1899 and 1909. The original spires were in height, but they were purposefully destroyed during World War I. The falling towers also damaged the roof; the interior, including the main altar and portions of the archives, was devastated by a fire in 1928. This prompted reconstruction of the church. The spires were rebuilt, but their height was lowered by 5 metres. There is also a legend related to the Puntukas stone, a famous stone in Lithuania. According to this legend, the devil wanted to destroy the church by dropping a heavy stone on it. However, early crowing of a rooster prevented this happening and the stone fell away from the church. It is now a visitor attraction. Architecture Anyk≈°ƒçiai Church with the monument of bishop Antanas Baranauskas in the park The present church building consists of twin towers, both of which are 79 metres in height. The building was built in red bricks in the Neo-Gothic architectural style. The floor plan follows the basic principles of cathedral architecture: it has two aisles and groin vaults. The church fa√ßade has stained glass windows which were installed between 1971‚Äì1986, credited to Marija Mackelaitƒó. Artistically decorated altars and the pulpits are seen inside the church. A statue of St Matthew is installed behind the large cross in the main altar. Inside the church, apart many elegant altars there are also statues and paintings. The church also has a large organ which was bought in 1998 from Shirley Baptist Church, Southampton. Rimas Idzelis, an amateur artist, installed Stations of the Cross on the churchyard fence in 1982‚Äì1988. The church is surrounded by a park. In 1993 a monument was built for the Lithuanian poet and bishop Antanas Baranauskas (1835‚Äì1902), native of Anyk≈°ƒçiai and author of the famous poem Anyk≈°ƒçi≈≥ ≈°ilelis (The Grove of Anyk≈°ƒçiai). Sculptor Ar≈´nas Sakalauskas and architect Riƒçardas Kri≈°tapaviƒçius were awarded the Lithuanian National Prize for the monument in 1994. Notable people Juozapas ƒåepƒónas (1880‚Äì1976) was pastor of Anyk≈°ƒçiai from 1938 to 1945. During that time he protested the Holocaust and Nazi occupation of Lithuania. Monsignor Albertas Talaƒçka (1921‚Äì1999), former pastor of Anyk≈°ƒçiai Church, bequeathed his private library of over 4,000 books and art collection to the town and parish of Anyk≈°ƒçiai.

The streets were built in this way to allow rope manufacturers to lay the ropes out lengthways during production.

In January 2016, Hamm stated that Saudi Arabia's attempt to flood the crude market at a time of oversupply and concerns about weakening demand is not working, believing that oil prices will double by year-end 2016, as Shawn Baldwin, Chairman of alternative investment firm The AIA Group, concurred with these statements. Political involvement Shortly after being named energy advisor to the Romney campaign in March 2012, Hamm donated $985,000 to the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future. On the eve of the Republican National Convention, Hamm was credited in a report with being among oil and energy executives consulted in a plan to devolve permitting on Federal lands to the state where the land is located. Romney's proposal, which was launched the same week as two industry fundraisers netted $10 million for the campaign, was seen as going beyond roots in the Sagebrush Rebellion of the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the sometimes controversial permitting policies of the George W.

In his speech, Harold Hamm also denounced the Iran nuclear deal struck by the U.S. Department of State in 2015, saying that it would improve that country's ability to export petroleum and enable Iranian development of the atomic bomb.Harold Hamm Full Speech 2016 Republican National Convention.

It was initially developed as a journal of accountancy issues in the UK, but has since expanded to cover broad global issues. Today, The Accountant is published monthly and reports on a range of topics, including changes in accounting standards, corporate reporting, audit quality, staff shortages, technology, IFRS, succession planning, tax and auditor liability. History The Accountant was established in 1874 as a journal for the accountancy profession.ICAEW: Accountancy Ancestors, ICAEW's history of The Accountant Its first publisher was Alfred Gee who wanted the publication to be independent. As the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales explains in its library database, Gee didn't want the magazine to be affiliated to any professional body, although in 1890 ICAEW's council encouraged its members to subscribe and submit articles for publication. , ICAEW's history of The Accountant The Accountant was originally published monthly but switched to a weekly publication date after January 1875. It developed a reputation for campaigning on issues of importance for accountants from its first edition‚Äî which called for accountants to lay aside rivalries and work together to develop the profession. From 1890, members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) were encouraged to subscribe and submit material to the publication, whilst publisher Alfred Gee persuaded a number of societies to advertise, making it a reputable publication. Gee & Co published The Accountant until 1980. Since then, the publication has undergone several ownership changes and was acquired by current owners Progressive Digital Media in 2012. First World War According to the ICAEW.

Details for 929 individuals are recorded in this index (615 recording deaths, 314 recording other news).‚Äù } Coverage Issues regularly include a region-round up, feature articles, analysis, comment and interviews with senior figures in the profession. The Accountant produces proprietary research in the form of Country Surveys of professional bodies. These reports provide analysis of the most important professional issues in national accountancy markets. They also survey professional bodies for student and membership data. The publication covers: * Regulatory developments from a global perspective * Updates and analysis of the standard setting process * News from the professional bodies * Market commentary and predictions from industry leaders. * Identification & analysis of key market trends * Comparative perspectives on service providers * Job moves & recruitment trends An inaugural world survey of the accountancy profession was published in the December 2009 edition of The Accountant (Issue 6073) which provides details of membership numbers for 37 professional accountancy bodies in 24 countries.

In early 2017, the three Welsh writers visited India to engage with the culture and take part in writing and reading events. In spring 2017, the three Indian authors will visit Wales. The project is being run in collaboration with Bee Books, an English publisher in Kolkata, India. The writers will blog about their experiences, and make use of them for the anthology.  Awards  Since its foundation in 1993, Parthian and its titles have regularly received recognition through award nominations. Welsh Boys Too, a collection of short stories by John Sam Jones, was named as a 'Stonewall Honor Book in Literature' in 2002, and in 2003 Lewis Davies' Work, Sex and Rugby picked up the World Book Day Award for Wales. The Long Dry, the debut novel from Cynan Jones, won the Betty Trask Award in 2007. In 2006, Parthian author Rachel Trezise became the first recipient of the Dylan Thomas Prize for her short story collection Fresh Apples. Following this success in the inaugural award, two further Parthian titles have been nominated for the ¬£30,000 prize: Jemma L. King's poetry collection The Shape of a Forest in 2013 and Alys Conran's novel Pigeon in 2017. Parthian has also enjoyed success in the Wales Book of the Year, an award given annually to the best Welsh and English language works by Welsh or Welsh interest authors.

Further wins followed in 2011 (with John Harrison's Cloud Road) and in 2017 (with Alys Conran's Pigeon). Parthian's record of three Wales Book of the Year awards is matched by Faber, and only bettered by Seren. Many award-winning individual short stories and poems have later been included in Parthian collections. Most notably, these include 'Mr. Roopratna's Chocolate' from Lewis Davies' Love and Other Possibilities, which won the Rhys Davies Prize in 1999, and 'Moon Dog' from Rebecca F John's Clown's Shoes, which won the PEN International New Voices Award in 2015.

About the school Bayview College is a Christian Community College, situated in a position which overlooks Portland Bay. It has both historic and new facilities and further developments are currently under construction, History Bayview College has a long history, as part of the Loreto Sisters' school that was established on that location in 1885. Mother Gonzaga Barry planned a Loreto foundation in Portland after spending time by the sea convalescing from an illness in around 1882. She was very keen to be able to provide holidays for her nuns and pupils and also a boarding and day school for young children. She, and a community of five, came to Portland in December 1884 and rented the six room cottage with lean-to belonging to David Edgar in North Bentinck Street. This bluestone cottage had been built by Stephen Henty in the early 1830s and from 1864-1865 had been Mary Mackillop‚Äôs family home and school. In 1885 the Loreto school opened. In 1977 the school, at the time a Catholic girls' school, became an ecumenical, co-educational Christian Community College, which in turn became Bayview in 1996. Member churches are Anglican, Baptist, Catholic, Church of Christ, Lutheran and the Uniting Church in Australia. Loreto continues actively to support Bayview.

A very small number of Murle live across the border in southwestern Ethiopia. They speak the Murle language, which belongs to the Southwestern branch of the Surmic languages group, within the larger Nilo- Saharan family. The basic word order for Murle clauses is VSO (verb‚Äìsubject‚Äìobject).(Arensen 1982) The morphology of the verb agrees with the person and number of the subject, and can also indicate that of the object. Some typologically exceptional points of grammar are discussed by Arensen, et al., such as that VSO languages have been predicted to not have postpositions or final interrogatives.Arensen, Jon, Nicky de Jong, Scott Randal, Peter Unseth. 1997. \\"Interrogatives in Surmic Languages and Greenberg's Universals\\", Occasional Papers in the Study of Sudanese Languages 7:71‚Äì90. Marking of number on nouns in Murle is complex, with no single suffix being generally productive. Some nouns are marked with a singulative suffix, some with a plural suffix, some with both, and a few with irregular stems for each number. Arensen has proposed a set of semantically based categories (such as association with men, or with weather and seasons) to try to predict which suffixes will be used (1992, 1998). Payne (2006) has proposed analyzing some cases as examples of subtractive morphology. Payne proposes that these two forms exemplify how Murle plurals can be predicted from singular forms, but not vice versa. onyiit 'rib' onyii 'ribs' rottin 'warrior' rotti 'warriors' However, the same final consonants are found in productive marking of singulative number in Majang, another Surmic language, e.g. ≈ã…õ…õti-n 'louse', ≈ã…õ…õti 'lice'.p. 124; Bender, M. Lionel. 1983. Majang phonology and morphology. In Nilo-Saharan Language Studies, ed. by M. Lionel Bender, 114-147. East Lansing: Michigan State University. Also, final -t has been shown to be a singulative suffix in Murle and other Surmic languages,p. 86. Unseth, Peter. 1988. Majang nominal plurals, with comparative notes. Studies in African Linguistics 19.1:75-91. fitting the pattern of T for singular and K for plural pointed out by Margaret Bryant.Bryan, Margaret. 1959. The T/K languages: A new substratum. Africa 29:1-21. If these final consonants are analyzed as singulative suffixes, it means that the claim of unusual discovery of subtractive morphology in Murle is incorrect. Rather, Murle is shown to have a frequent pattern of singulative suffixes. The New Testament has been translated into the Murle language. References Literature * Arensen, Jonathan E. 1982.

It was the first iOS video game to run on the Unreal Engine. In the game, the unnamed player character fights a series of one-on-one battles in a derelict castle to face the immortal God King. When in battle, players swipe the screen to attack and parry, and tap the screen to dodge and block enemy attacks. Upon defeat, the player restarts the game as the character's descendant with the same items and experience level. The game was developed by a team of twelve people, who took two months to make a playable demo and three more to finish the game. Infinity Blade was intended to demonstrate the new iOS version of the Unreal Engine, and to combine the swordplay of Karateka and Prince of Persia with the loneliness of Shadow of the Colossus. The game received four free expansions that added new equipment, endings, and game modes. Infinity Blade was the fastest-grossing app in the history of iOS upon its release. It made US$1.6 million in its first four days, and over US$23 million by the end of 2011. It was well-received by gaming critics. Reviews praised the graphics and compared the mobile game favorably to console games. Critics also praised the swipe-based combat system, but split opinions on the cyclical gameplay as either addictive or repetitive. Chair later released an arcade port and two sequels: Infinity Blade II and Infinity Blade III. Author Brandon Sanderson also wrote two novellas set between the games: Infinity Blade: Awakening and Infinity Blade: Redemption. The game, along with its two sequels, was removed from the App Store on December 10, 2018, due to difficulties in updating the game for newer hardware. Gameplay alt=An armored swordsman stands facing a large armored monster holding an axe in a stone hall. In the primary portion of Infinity Blade, the player character travels a mostly linear path through a ruined castle and fights one-on-one battles with oversized enemies. The path through the castle is a series of discrete locations where the player can pan the camera around the stationary player character to view a fully three- dimensional area. The player taps locations highlighted onscreen to trigger either a short cutscene as the player character moves to the next location, or a sword battle with an enemy. During combat, the player controls the character's sword by swiping a finger across the screen. Players can touch icons at the bottom of the screen to dodge attacks by ducking right or left, or to block attacks with a shield, which has a limited number of uses during a single battle. Players may also parry incoming attacks with an intercepting sword move that, for example, parries an attack from the left with a swipe to the left. Each of these three counters can leave the enemy vulnerable to counterattack for a short period, but incorrect counters result in damage to the player character, as reflected in the health bar. When players fail in battle en route to the God King, the game resets to the location preceding the previous battle. Enemies can perform attacks that cannot be parried or blocked‚Äîsuch as a shield bash‚Äîthat must be dodged. Players use two special abilities via icons atop the screen: the Super Attack temporarily stuns the opponent, and magic heals or attacks as indicated by drawing a given symbol. Both require time to recharge after use. When attacking, the player can swipe in any direction, and can do specific attack combinations to deal extra damage. In addition to combat, there is also a mild role-playing component. An experience point system levels up the player character and their equipment (weapons, armor, shields, helms, and magic rings). Equipment pieces have special properties and a predetermined amount of experience points required to master them. Mastering a piece of equipment increases its sale value but decreases the player's experience gain by 20%. Upon leveling up or mastering a piece of equipment, players gain attribute points that can be allotted towards four character attributes: health, attack, shield power, or magic. Each point can only be allocated once and is a permanent upgrade to the character. Players can purchase new equipment using in-game money from sacks and treasure chests found throughout the castle, defeated enemies, and sales of unused equipment. In-game money can be purchased with real money within the game. The game follows a cyclical narrative structure in which the protagonist and his descendants individually explore a castle in a quest to battle the primary antagonist, the immortal God King. In the game's introduction, the non- playable protagonist has just finished this quest, but is slain by the God King. The player then assumes the role of the dead protagonist's descendant as he starts his journey at the beginning of the castle. This cycle, called a bloodline, continues after the player finally faces the God King and either dies or wins. The player may also choose to join the God King and terminate the cycle; upon doing so, the game resumes at the checkpoint before fighting the God King. Enemy difficulty increases with each bloodline cycle. Another bloodline ending is unlocked after purchasing the Infinity Blade item: the sword is placed into a pedestal in the castle's underground dungeons and three doors open. After then defeating each of the three \\"Deathless\\"‚Äîimmortal beings like the God King‚Äîof increasing difficulty found within, a final fourth door opens, and the player faces a mechanized warrior guarding the high-tech chamber where the God King is reborn whenever he is killed. Upon defeating the mechanized warrior, the chamber is revealed to be controlled by an ancestor of the player character, who chose to serve the God King. After fighting the ancestor, the player character is told that the Infinity Blade can prevent immortals like the God King from resurrecting after death. The player is then given the option of either starting the next bloodline as they do when defeated, or resetting the game and starting New Game+ mode, which resets all gold and item progression but maintains the character's experience level, letting the player remaster the items and level up even further. Expansions Chair Entertainment released four expansions as free updates to the game. The first, released December 20, 2010, added a new enemy, equipment, and microtransactions. It also removed an experience level cap. The second update, titled Infinity Blade: The Deathless Kings, was released on March 2, 2011, and added the dungeons as a second branch to the game's path. This expansion also added new equipment, enemies, and the second ending where the player character defeats his ancestor. The third update, Infinity Blade: Arena, was released on May 19, 2011. It added the player vs. player \\"Arena Mode\\", a tiered combat game progression where one player fights as the hero and the other as an enemy from the game. The update also included new equipment and a single-player version of Arena Mode called \\"Survival Mode\\". On October 4, 2011, a fourth update added a new enemy and new equipment to coincide with the announcement of the forthcoming sequel Infinity Blade II. Development Chair co-founder and creative director Donald Mustard at the 2011 alt=A man with short, spiked up hair stands with his hands up and a microphone clipped to his shirt Infinity Blade was created by Chair Entertainment, a subsidiary company of Epic Games. In July 2010, Chair had both recently finished the Xbox Live Arcade game Shadow Complex and been acquired by Epic. Chair was brainstorming Kinect and Wii games, including an idea similar to Infinity Blade, and Epic was nearing completion of an iOS version of the Unreal Engine 3 graphics engine and in need of a \\"killer game\\" to show it off. Epic had previously licensed the engine for use in numerous console and personal computer games. They asked Chair to develop a game for the engine in five months, with a playable demo for the Apple Special Event conference in two months. The team decided within a few days to work on the Infinity Blade concept, codenamed \\"Project Sword\\". Instead of normal initial game development, where working prototypes test gameplay ideas, Chair spent the first week of development refining the gameplay concept on paper before beginning to code. Many of the core gameplay ideas were developed in their first few hours. Geremy Mustard, Chair's co-founder and technical director, estimates that the team cut two-thirds of that initial design due to lack of time. Refining the complex touch-based interface was complicated due to the Unreal Engine's incomplete status and the native iOS code library's lack of support for fast touch-based gameplay. The five-month development was completed by a team of twelve people from Chair, with assistance from Epic. In addition to Geremy Mustard, the team was composed of Chair co-founder and creative director Donald Mustard; Simon Hurley as producer; Joshua Andersen and Scott K. Bowen as programmers; Adam Ford as art director; Orlando Barrowes, Bert Lewis, Mike Low, Scott Stoddard, and Nathan Trewartha as artists and animators; Joshua Akers as composer; and Brandon Raul Campos as lead tester. The game's swipe-based swordplay was based on Donald Mustard's desire for unique gameplay based on nuanced sword fighting and parrying. He described the game's influences as the combat of Karateka and Prince of Persia combined with the \\"lonely epicness\\" of Shadow of the Colossus. Chair sought to develop an experience that could be picked up and played for a minute (a single battle) or half an hour (a bloodline). They felt that many other developers accustomed to consoles were wrong to make iOS games that required long-playing experiences to feel meaningful, and so Chair developed the bloodline concept as a natural breakpoint. They also felt that mobile games like Infinity Blade with constant action elements went too long without giving the player time to relax and resulted in player exhaustion, and so Chair kept their battles short with brief cinematic pauses in longer battles. Chair showed their playable demo at the Apple conference on September 1, 2010, after weeks of rehearsal, and attracted much attention to the game. It was released on December 9, 2010. While Chair itself spent little on marketing, Apple used the game extensively in advertisements for its devices. The music for the game was composed by Josh Aker, who had written the music for previous Chair games. The soundtrack was intended by Aker to be \\"intense\\" during combat, but to vary between \\"serene\\" and \\"otherworldly\\" outside battle. It is a mixture of live and synthetic instrument performances. Cello and nyckelharpa were the primary instruments used. Aker wanted to have \\"avant-garde performances\\" for the recordings. The soundtrack was sold as a digital album, Infinity Blade: Original Soundtrack, through several online music retailers. Chair began to develop the game's first update before the initial game was released. They intended only to add new monsters and features, but added the ability to purchase gold due to customer requests. Chair did not rebalance the game to incentivize in-app purchases. Work on The Deathless Kings update began immediately afterward. Chair felt that releasing several large, free updates to the game would increase their overall user base and result in more total sales due to word of mouth. Reception Infinity Blade was noted for its sales at launch, selling more than 270,000 copies and making over US$1.6 million in its first four days‚Äîthe \\"fastest-grossing app\\" ever released for iOS at the time. By the end of 2011, it had made at least US$23 million in revenue. Around fourteen months after the initial release, Chair noted that half of the game's sales were for the iPhone and half were for the iPad and iPod. After releasing the sequel, Epic Games noted in 2012 that the series was Epic's most profitable by measure of revenue against person-hours spent in development. Infinity Blade was reviewed by several major gaming sites in addition to mobile game-focused sites. Critics praised the game's graphics heavily. IGN reviewer Hilary Goldstein said that it was \\"an absolute stunner for any handheld device and ushers in a new era of possibility for high-end graphics.\\" GamePro Ryan Rigney called the game \\"downright gorgeous\\" and said that the graphics were almost at the level of an Xbox 360 game, which was echoed by John Meyer of Wired, who claimed that it had the best graphics of any iPad game. The reviewer for Edge further praised the art direction, especially with regards to the enemy and armor designs. The gameplay was generally praised by reviewers, who typically found the combat engaging, but were split on the repetitive aspects of the game. 1UP.com's Matt Clark said that the sword gameplay \\"just feels right\\", while Mark Brown of Eurogamer said that the combat had an excitement factor that pushed players to keep on going for one more battle. Tracy Erickson of Pocket Gamer described the swipe-based combat system as \\"easy to understand, though tough to master\\", and Nick Chester of Destructoid said that although the combat was not very complicated, it was fun to play. The role-playing game elements were praised‚ÄîDestructoid's Chester called them \\"satisfying\\", and IGN's Goldstein said that they added to the game's difficulty. Brown's review for Eurogamer, however, said that while good they were not as engaging as the combat, and the Edge review dismissed them as minimal. Reviewers had mixed opinions on the effectiveness of the bloodline system's repetition: Destructoid's Chester described it as addictive, and IGN's Goldstein agreed, but Erickson's review for Pocket Gamer said that the game had problems with repetition and Wired Meyer dismissed it as \\"repetitive ... as the title suggests\\". J. Nicholas Geist, writing for Kill Screen, focused his entire review on the cyclical nature of the game, treating its nature of repetition with small changes between each bloodline as a metaphor for life. Most reviewers found themselves between the two extremes, with Brown of Eurogamer simultaneously describing it as \\"alarmingly repetitious\\" but still addictive and 1UP.com's Clark saying that enjoying the game required getting past the repetition, despite being \\"stellar\\". Sequels and spin-offs On October 28, 2011, Epic Games and Adrenaline Amusements released an arcade version of the game, Infinity Blade FX. The game is played on a 46-inch screen rigged with optical sensors to mimic a large iPhone or iPad screen. Each arcade stand contains up to three screens, and players can play against each other or in the single-player game. A sequel to the iOS game, Infinity Blade II, was announced on October 4, 2011, during the Apple iPhone 4S keynote presentation. It was released on December 1, 2011, and features enhanced graphics, a new storyline, and new fighting styles. A spinoff game, Infinity Blade: Dungeons, was in development for iOS by Epic Games subsidiary Impossible Games, but was cancelled in February 2013 when Impossible Games was shut down. A final game in the trilogy, Infinity Blade III, was released on September 18, 2013. A novella by author Brandon Sanderson was released before both Infinity Blade II and III to serve as a story bridge between the games. Infinity Blade: Awakening was released as an e-book on October 4, 2011, to correspond with the announcement of Infinity Blade II. The story gives the protagonist of the first game a name, Siris, introduces the idea that the God King was one of multiple Deathless in the world, as is Siris, and has Siris and the assassin Isa journey to find the Worker of Secrets in order to kill the resurrected God King and the other Deathless. The second e-book novella, Infinity Blade: Redemption, was released on September 9, 2013, just before the third game. In it, Siris and the God King escape from their imprisonment by the Worker of Secrets, while extensive flashbacks show the rise of the Deathless in a future-Earth analog. While Siris disrupts the Worker of Secret's plans, the God King confronts and is killed by the Worker. A Chinese version of the game for Xbox One and Android was published by Tencent Games on November 28, 2015. A day after Epic Games removed the Infinity Blade trilogy from the App Store, the titular weapon made a crossover appearance in the winter-themed seventh season of Fortnite Battle Royale as a unique, very powerful melee weapon that can be obtained in a match, granting any player who finds it devastating abilities and extra survivability, at the cost of being unable to use other items. Three days later, however, Epic Games later \\"vaulted\\" the weapon over concerns that it was too overpowered. Epic Games later brought back the Infinity Blade in February 2019 as a restricted item that is only available in the limited-time mode \\"Sword Fight\\", nerfing it and allowing multiple copies of it to be found from loot chests.

It was enacted by the Western Cape Provincial Legislature in terms of Chapter 6 of the national constitution, and came into force on 16 January 1998. The Western Cape is the only South African province to have adopted a constitution. History The current nine provinces of South Africa were created by the Interim Constitution, which was drawn up during the negotiations to end apartheid. The Interim Constitution included provisions for a provincial legislature to adopt a provincial constitution by a two-thirds vote; but none were successfully adopted under its terms. (A proposed constitution for KwaZulu-Natal was rejected by the Constitutional Court in 1996.) The final (and current) national constitution includes similar provisions, which allow a provincial legislature to adopt a provincial constitution by the vote of two-thirds of its members. The process of drawing up a provincial constitution for the Western Cape was initiated in July 1996 by then-Premier Hernus Kriel, while the final national constitution was still under negotiation. The bill to enact the new constitution was passed by the Provincial Legislature on 21 February 1997 and referred to the Constitutional Court, which had to determine whether it was consistent with the national constitution (which had come into effect on 4 February). The Constitutional Court rejected a number of clauses, but the main objection was a provision that provided for members of the provincial parliament to be elected from multiple-member geographical constituencies, as opposed to the party-list proportional representation prescribed by the national constitution. The national constitution allows provincial constitutions to contain different \\"legislative or executive structures and procedures\\", but the court ruled that an electoral system was not a \\"legislative structure\\" and that the province did not have the power to vary the electoral system. The court also objected to provisions which placed the responsibility for administering provincial oaths of office on the Judge President of the Western Cape High Court rather than the President of the Constitutional Court; as judges are national officials, the provincial legislature did not have the power to alter their responsibilities. The constitution was referred back to the provincial legislature to correct the impermissible sections, and an amended bill was passed on 11 September 1997. It was certified by the Constitutional Court on 18 November 1997, signed by the Premier on 15 January 1998, and came into effect on the following day. Contents The Constitution of the Western Cape consists of a preamble, 11 chapters containing a total of 84 sections, and three schedules. Many of the provisions of the Western Cape constitution restate the corresponding provisions of the national constitution (in particular chapter six, which deals with provincial government), and therefore this section describes primarily those cases where the provincial constitution differs from or adds to the national constitution. The provincial constitution declares Afrikaans, English and isiXhosa to be the official languages of the province; the 2011 census found that 95% of the province's population speaks one of these as a first language. The Western Cape constitution names the legislature the \\"provincial parliament\\", while in other provinces it is known as the \\"provincial legislature\\". The number of members of the parliament is also fixed at 42, whereas the size of other provincial legislatures is determined by the Independent Electoral Commission by a formula based on provincial population. Where in other provinces the provincial executive power is vested in a Premier and an Executive Council consisting of MECs appointed by the Premier, in the Western Cape the Premier appoints a Provincial Cabinet whose members are referred to as Provincial Ministers. The provincial constitution provides for the creation of \\"cultural councils\\" to represent cultural and linguistic communities within the province. It also requires the appointment of a Commissioner for the Environment to oversee environmental conservation, and a Commissioner for Children to guard the interests of children. It lists a number of \\"directive principles\\" which are intended to guide the policy of the provincial government, but are not legally enforceable.

Based on research by Andy Sumner,Sumner, A. (2010a) 'Global Poverty and the New Bottom Billion: Three- quarters of the World's Poor Live in Middle-income Countries', IDS Working Paper 349, Brighton: Institute of Development Studies. Retrieved 3 January 2011Sumner, A. (2010b) 'Global Poverty and the New Bottom Billion: What if Three-Quarters of the World's Poor Live in Middle-Income Countries?', IPC-UNDP Working Paper 74, Brasilia: IPC-UNDP. Retrieved 3 January 2011 a Research Fellow at the Institute of Development Studies, the New Bottom Billion raises serious questions about Paul Collier‚Äôs original Bottom Billion thesis, particularly in relation to its claims regarding the geographical distribution of global poverty. While Collier argued that the Bottom Billion are to be found in the poorest 60 or so economies,Collier, P. (2007) The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries are Failing and What Can Be Done About It, New York: Oxford University Press Sumner's research shows that the majority of the world's poor actually live in MICs such as China, India, Nigeria and Indonesia. The New Bottom Billion therefore suggests that poverty is not just a Low Income Country (LIC) problem, and that further policy discussions are called for. The New Bottom Billion has received significant coverage in a diverse range of independent sources, including The Economist, OECD Insights, and various third-party blogs (see External Links below).  Findings  Among the key findings ‚Äî which are based on official World Bank data and country classifications, and are also consistent across monetary, nutritional and multidimensional poverty measures (see for example the Multidimensional Poverty Index) ‚Äî Sumner‚Äôs research shows that: *While MICs account for 960 million of the world's poorest 1.3 billion people, LICs account for just 370 million. *Approximately two-thirds of the world‚Äôs poor live in stable MICs not affected by major violent conflict. Fragile LICs now account for just 12% of the world's poor. *About 23 per cent of the world‚Äôs poor live in fragile states if one takes the broadest definition of FCAS (43 countries), and they are split fairly evenly between fragile LICs and fragile MICs. Previous estimates put this figure significantly higher at around one-third. *While many of the New Bottom Billion live in China and India, the percentage of global poverty accounted for by MICs minus China and India has still risen considerably from 7 per cent to 22 per cent since 1990.  Significance and implications  The New Bottom Billion is important because: It challenges how we view world poverty and its causes. We used to think poverty was due to a lack of resources in 'poor' countries. The New Bottom Billion suggests world poverty isn't primarily about resources for most of the world's poor; it is about inequality ‚Äî the poor live in countries which are no longer officially 'poor'. It challenges aid allocations and the way donors and NGOs go about poverty reduction. We used to think aid was the answer to poverty. If many countries are no longer officially 'poor' then the allocation of aid needs an urgent global review. This might mean that governance and domestic taxation and redistribution policies become of more importance than Official Development Assistance (ODA).Glennie, J. (2010) 'Which bottom billion?', The Guardian Datablog. Retrieved 3 January 2011 It changes how we view 'developing' countries. There used to be a rich or 'developed' world and a poor or 'developing world', but these findings show that there are only 39 'poor' countries remaining, and that most 'developing' countries (102 countries) are no longer officially 'poor'.

The text is fragmentary, and the sequence of events in the story is a reconstruction. The text is usually taken as an account of a Hurrian myth,e.g. Friedrich, ZA 49 (1950) 214f but it does not itself contain any Hurrian names or other vocabulary to support this judgement. The geographical setting is in Mesopotamia.Gary Beckman, ‚ÄúMesopotamians and Mesopotamian Learning at ·∏™attu≈°a,‚Äù Journal of Cuneiform Studies vol. 35, No. 1/2 (1983), 97-114 The reconstructed argument of the text is as follows: Appu is a rich man, but he is unhappy because he has no son. The text hints at the possibility that Appu doesn't know anything about sex. He sacrifices a lamb to ask the help of the gods. The sun-god appears and advises him to get drunk and then have sex with his wife. Eventually, Appu's wife gives birth to a first son, named () \\"bad, evil\\". At this point the text alludes to a rite of name-giving, paralleled in the Song of Ullikummi, where the newborn is set on the knee of the father. Appu's wife later gives birth to a second son, named () \\"good, righteous\\". When both sons have reached adult age, Idalu suggests that they divide the paternal estate among them. He argues that, as each of the gods has his own city, so should they also each have their own property. Idalu tricks his brother, taking most of the estate and leaving him only with a barren cow. But the sun-god blesses the cow and restores her fertility. At this point the first tablet ends and the rest of the story is very fragmentary. It appears to deal with litigation between the brothers; Idalu seems to take Handanza to court before the sun-god at Sippar. When the god rules in favour of Handanza, Idalu curses, and the sun-god refuses to conclude the case, sending the brothers to Ishtar at Nineveh to conclude the case.Gwendolyn Leick, A dictionary of ancient Near Eastern mythology (1991).

Information Marko Feingold was born in Beszterceb√°nya/Neusohl, Austria-Hungary, today Bansk√° Bystrica, Slovakia. He grew up in Leopoldstadt, Vienna. After he had trained in business, he found work in Vienna, became unemployed and travelled with his brother, Ernst, in Italy. In 1938, he was arrested in Vienna during a short visit. At first he escaped, to Prague, was expelled to Poland and turned back to Prague with false papers. In 1939, he was arrested again and deported to the concentration camp at Auschwitz. He was also imprisoned in the concentration camps at Neuengamme and Dachau and finally the concentration camp Buchenwald in 1941, where he stayed until his liberation in 1945. He moved to Salzburg by chance, where he stayed. Between 1945 and 1948, he helped Jewish survivors who were living in displaced person camps in Salzburg and organised, with the Jewish refugee organisation Bricha, the emigration of Jews from middle and eastern Europe to Palestine. In 1948 he acquired a fashion store.Alexandra F√∂derl-Schmid: Marko Feingold gestorben: Der Retter. sueddeutsche.de (in German). Retrieved 2019-09-20. At that time he was initially a member of the SP√ñ, but later left the party due to its particularly anti-Semitic orientation influenced by Karl Renner, but also Bruno Kreisky. Nevertheless, he later became an honorary member. As one of the oldest contemporary witnesses, Feingold explicitly commented in 2013 and 2018 in the media on Karl Renner's support for the Anschluss and anti-Semitism. Feingold also criticized the social democrats in this context and said that after 1945, after a complaint by the party secretary of the SP√ñ, he was chased out with the words Saujud, verschwind!).

The school buildings were constructed in the Light Timber Construction (LTC) style which was developed by the Public Works Department to aide in the speedy construction of schools in the 1950s and 1960s. The school was constructed in several stages, and consists of two LTC wings, joined by a link corridor. The school buildings are rendered in pre-cast cement tiles, and aside from minor refurbishment are largely as originally constructed. In the early 1980s the Science Wing, on the South side, burnt down. Arson was considered the cause, but never proved. The Science Wing was rebuilt and reopened for the start of the 1985 school year. The school celebrated its 50th anniversary in June 2010. The Beaufort Primary School, No. 60, and the local Kindergarten has moved to the High/Secondary School Site and it is now a K-12.

FDA warns consumers to avoid sexual enhancement pills, Sanjay Gupta, CNN, December 13th, 2010 A range of designer analogues of USA FDA-approved inhibitors of type-5 cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE5), such as sildenafil and vardenafil, have been detected in recent years as adulterants in over-the-counter herbal aphrodisiac products and dietary supplements, in an apparent attempt to circumvent both the legal restrictions on sale of erectile dysfunction drugs, which are prescription-only medicines in most Western countries, and the patent protection which prevents sale of these drugs by competitors except under license to their inventors. These compounds have been demonstrated to display PDE5 inhibitory activity in vitro and presumably have similar effects when consumed, but have undergone no formal testing in either humans or animals, and as such represent a significant health risk to consumers of these products due to their unknown safety profile. Some attempts have been made to ban these drugs as unlicensed medicines, but progress has been slow so far, as even in those jurisdictions which have laws targeting designer drugs, the laws are drafted to ban analogues of illegal drugs of abuse, rather than analogues of prescription medicines. However at least one court case has resulted in a product being taken off the market. In December 2010, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning to consumers about such products stating, \\"The FDA has found many products marketed as dietary supplements for sexual enhancement during the past several years that can be harmful because they contain active ingredients in FDA- approved drugs or variations of these ingredients.\\"FDA warns consumers to avoid Man Up Now capsules, United States Food and Drug Administration, Dec. 15, 2010 See also * Aildenafil * Acetildenafil * Nitrosoprodenafil References Designer drugs PDE5 inhibitors Phenol ethers Piperazines Pyrazolopyrimidines Sulfonamides Thiocarbonyl compounds ","title":"Sulfoaildenafil"},{"id":"30046826","text":"General elections were held in Mauritania on 8 August 1971 to elect a President and National Assembly, the first time the two elections had been held together.

Reporter Elizabeth Bernstein defined, in a Wall Street Journal article, nagging as \\"the interaction in which one person repeatedly makes a request, the other person repeatedly ignores it and both become increasingly annoyed\\". Thus, nagging is a form of persistent persuasion that is more repetitive than aggressive and it is an interaction to which each party contributes. Nagging is a very common form of persuasion used in all aspects of life including domestic and professional. It is also a common practice in order to avoid more aggressive persuasive moves like threats. The word is derived from the Scandinavian nagga, which means \\"to gnaw\\".  Dynamics  Kari P. Soule describes nagging as an \\"interpersonal ritual\\" but states that the term \\"seldom appears in interpersonal communication or conflict textbooks. It appears that 'nagging' is commonly used in everyday conversation but it rarely makes it to academic print\\". Nagging as a form of interpersonal communication is considered to be a repetitious form of persuasion that can be employed as an alternative to resorting to more aggressive tactics in order to gain compliance. Martin Kozloff, Ph.D., Professor of Education at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, identifies four main steps of nagging : # The nagger gives the signal to perform or stop performing a task or behaviour. # The person being nagged does not comply to the request from the nagger. # In response, the nagger repeats his request or signal in a further effort to gain compliance. # The person being nagged again responds with non-compliance. Kozloff argues that this interaction cycle continues until either the one who is being nagged complies to the nagger‚Äôs request or the nagger gives up the attempt to persuade. Kozloff identifies other important aspects of nagging; for instance, non-compliance is necessary for the persuader to be persistent. In addition, the persuader will often change the initial requests words and paralinguistic cues as a strategic tactic to entice the target into complying with the request. Regarding compliance, behavioural noncompliance describes the situation that occurs when the person being nagged remains silent or agrees to complete the request, but later does not follow through. This strategy is employed to end the confrontation or interaction quickly without conflict, which is why it is common among spouses or partners. As the nagging interaction that starts out in a calm and polite manner continues and the persuader becomes more repetitive, the interaction is more likely to become aggressive in nature. Verbal noncompliance, on the other hand, describes the situation that occurs when the target tells the persuader through words that he will not comply, and is a more direct tactic than behavioural noncompliance. An example of verbal noncompliance could be a simple no, or I am too busy right now, or an even more elaborate response. This tactic does end the nagging interaction more rapidly; however, it can cause a more aggressive response from the persuader, who may escalate persistent persuasion into a threat or another aggressive form of persuasion. Psychotherapists such as Edward S. Dean, M.D. have reported that individuals who nag are often \\"weak, insecure, and fearful ... their nagging disguises a basic feeling of weakness and provides an illusion of power and superiority\\". Nagging is sometimes used by spouses of alcoholics as one of several \\"drinking control efforts\\", but it is often unproductive. Psychologically, nagging can act to reinforce behavior. A study by the University of Florida found the main factors that lead a person to nag are differences in \\"gender, social distance, and social status and power\\". Gender Kari P. Soule found an equal number of men and women nag; however, studies have shown that women are more likely to nag both men and women, while men are more likely to nag only men. Meaning women nag all people, which can be attributed to the reason why women are stereotyped as nagging people all the time.Soule, K. P. (2001). Persistence in compliance-gaining interactions: The Role of Nagging Behavior (Unpublished doctoral dissertation). Northwestern University, Evanston, IL Marital Nagging by spouses is a common marital complaint. Nagging can be found between both male and female spouses. According to The Wall Street Journal, \\"It is possible for husbands to nag, and wives to resent them for nagging. But women are more likely to nag, experts say, largely because they are conditioned to feel more responsible for managing home and family life. And they tend to be more sensitive to early signs of problems in a relationship.\\" An 1897 article in Good Housekeeping magazine stated that at that time, topics differed by gender; husbands' nagging usually involved finding \\"fault with their dinner, with the household bills [and] with the children\\", along with \\"carry[ing] home the worries of business.\\". Parental and child A study done at Washington State University and published in 1959 described parental nagging of children as being a \\"symptom of the rejection of the child\\" in circumstances when children's requirements regarding \\"time and energy\\" are perceived to interfere with the mother's \\"individual needs and aspirations.\\" According to James U. McNeal, there are seven classifications of juvenile nagging, wherein children nag their parents to obtain something they desire.  History  During the Middle Ages, a scold's bridle, also called a brank, was an instrument of punishment used primarily on women. The device was an iron muzzle in an iron framework that enclosed the head. A bridle-bit (or curb-plate), about 2 inches long and 1 inch broad, projected into the mouth and pressed down on top of the tongue. The curb-plate was frequently studded with spikes, so that if the offender moved her tongue, it inflicted pain and made speaking impossible. Wives who were seen as witches, shrews and scolds, were forced to wear the branks, locked onto their head.
