An untreated hygroma can develop into a large swelling that stresses the surrounding skin and becomes an open wound with the possibility of infection that is much more difficult to treat. In most cases, a hygroma is a single occurrence for an animal, but other individuals will have repeated problems with hygromas. =Surgery or aspiration= FNA and surgery is often not recommended, as these can introduce infection and the hygroma will return. Donut bandages and soft bedding are key to treating. In the past, it was common for veterinarians to treat hygromas by aspiration (using a syringe and drawing the fluid out) or surgically placing a drain. This can address the symptom, but does not treat the cause of the hygroma. In addition, any incision at a joint can be difficult to close and may result in an open sore. Consequently, the recommended treatment of choice for most hygromas is no longer aspiration or surgery, but commercially available elbow pads made for the treatment of this condition. =Additional bedding= Providing bedding or other padding in the areas the animal lies down can be helpful.

Naps are most often taken as a response to drowsiness during waking hours. A nap is a form of biphasic or polyphasic sleep, where the latter terms also include longer periods of sleep in addition to one single period. For years, scientists have been investigating the benefits of napping, including the 30-minute nap as well as sleep durations of 1‚Äì2 hours. Performance across a wide range of cognitive processes has been tested. Benefits =Prescribed napping for sleep disorders= It has been shown that excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) can be improved by prescribed napping in narcolepsy.Takashi, M. (2003). The role of prescribed napping in sleep medicine. Sleep Medicine Reviews, Vol. 7, No. 3, pp 227¬±235, doi:10.1053/smrv.2002.0241 Apart from narcolepsy, it has not been demonstrated that naps are beneficial for EDS in other sleep disorders. Negative effects =Sleep inertia= The state of grogginess, impaired cognition and disorientation experienced when awakening from sleep is known as sleep inertia.Dinges, D. F. (1990). Are you awake? Cognitive performance and reverie during the hypnopompic state. In: Bootzin, R., Kihlstrom, J., Schacter, D., eds. Sleep and Cognition. Washington, DC: American Psychological Society; 159‚Äì175. doi:10.1037/10499-012 This state reduces the speed of cognitive tasks but has no effects on the accuracy of task performance.Takashi, M. (2003). The role of prescribed napping in sleep medicine. Sleep Medicine Reviews, Vol. 7, No. 3, pp 227¬±235,doi: 10.1053/smrv.2002.0241 The effects of sleep inertia rarely last longer than 30 minutes in the absence of prior sleep deprivation.Tassi, P., Muzet, A. (2000). Sleep inertia. Sleep Medicine Reviews, Vol. 4, No. 4, pp 341‚Äì353, ISSN 1087-0792. doi:10.1053/smrv.2000.0098 =Association with health risks in the elderly= Epidemiological research has suggested napping as a risk factor for morbidity and mortality in elderly people.Hays, J. C., Blazer, D. G., Foley, D. J. (1996). Risk of napping: excessive daytime sleepiness and mortality in an older community population. J Am Geriatr Soc, 44: 693¬±698. doi:10.1111/j.1532-5415.1996.tb01834.x =On sleep disorders= For idiopathic hypersomnia, patients typically experience sleep inertia and are unrefreshed after napping.Choo, K. L., Guilleminault, C. (1998). Narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnolence. Clin Chest Med, 19: 169¬±181. doi:10.1016/S0272-5231(05)70440-8 Power nap A power nap, also known as a Stage 2 nap, is a short slumber of 20 minutes or less which terminates before the occurrence of deep slow-wave sleep (SWS), intended to quickly revitalize the napper. The expression \\"power nap\\" was coined by Cornell University social psychologist James Maas. The 20-minute nap increases alertness and motor skills. Various durations may be recommended for power naps, which are very short compared to regular sleep. The short duration prevents nappers from sleeping so long that they enter the slow wave portion of the normal sleep cycle without being able to complete the cycle. Entering deep, slow-wave sleep and failing to complete the normal sleep cycle, can result in a phenomenon known as sleep inertia, where one feels groggy, disoriented, and even sleepier than before beginning the nap. In order to attain optimal post-nap performance, a Stage 2 nap must be limited to the beginning of a sleep cycle, specifically sleep stages N1 and N2, typically 18‚Äì25 minutes. Experimental confirmation of the benefits of this brief nap comes from a Flinders University study in Australia in which 5, 10, 20, or 30-minute periods of sleep were given. The greatest immediate improvement in measures of alertness and cognitive performance came after the 10 minutes of sleep. The 20 and 30-minute periods of sleep showed evidence of sleep inertia immediately after the naps and improvements in alertness more than 30 minutes later but not to a greater level than after the 10 minutes of sleep. People who regularly take these short naps, or catnaps, may develop a good idea of the duration which works best for them, as well as which tools, environment, position, and associated factors help produce the best results. Power naps are effective even when schedules allow a full night's sleep. Mitsuo Hayashi and Tadao Hori have demonstrated that a nap improves mental performance, even after a full night's sleep. Stimulant or caffeine nap A short nap preceded by the intake of caffeine was investigated by British researchers. In a driving simulator and a series of studies, Horne and Reyner looked at the effects of cold air, radio, a break with no nap, a nap, caffeine pill vs. placebo and a short nap preceded by caffeine on mildly sleep-deprived subjects. The caffeine nap was by far the most effective in reducing driving \\"incidents\\" and subjective sleepiness. Caffeine in coffee takes up to a half- hour to have an alerting effect, hence \\"a short (<15min) nap will not be compromised if it is taken immediately after the coffee.\\"Lifehacker article Systematic napping as a lifestyle A contemporary idea called polyphasic sleeping entails avoiding long periods of sleep, instead taking regularly spaced short naps. Sara Mednick, whose sleep research investigates the effects of napping, included a chapter, \\"Extreme Napping\\", in her book Take a Nap!. In response to questions from readers about the \\"uberman\\" schedule of \\"polyphasic sleeping\\", she commented as follows: Notes Further reading *Naska, A., Oikonomou, E., Trichopoulou, A., Psaltopoulou, T. and Trichopoulos, D.

History  *Dark and Light was founded in 1982 by the ophthalmologist Martien Cozijnsen and his wife Jenny. The small 'family foundation' has grown into the biggest development organisation in the Netherlands working for the prevention of blindness and the rehabilitation of persons with disabilities. *The Austrian organisation LIGHT FOR THE WORLD was founded in 1988 in Vienna under the name \\"Christoffel-Blindenmission Austria\\". Among the first projects of the young Austrian organisation were eye care units and rehabilitation programmes in Ethiopia and Kenya.http://www.lichtfuerdiewelt.at/content/geschichte *The Belgian branch of LIGHT FOR THE WORLD was founded in 1997 under the name of Christian Blind Mission Belgium. One of the first programmes supported was CCBRT ‚Äì an orthopaedic and eye care hospital and rehabilitation programme in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. *In 1999 the initiative \\"VISION 2020 ‚Äì The Right To Sight\\" was launched in cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB). *LIGHT FOR THE WORLD has been an active participant in this global action plan to eliminate preventable blindness by the year 2020 right from the beginning. *In 2004, the Austrian organisation changed its name to LICHT F√úR DIE WELT - Christoffel-Entwicklungszusammenarbeit, the German language equivalent of LIGHT FOR THE WORLD. Austrian Federal President, Dr. Heinz Fischer, became patron of LIGHT FOR THE WORLD. *In 2007, the Czech branch of LIGHT FOR THE WORLD was founded in Prague and currently supports programmes in Ethiopia. *In 2008 a formal agreement of confederation was signed by LIGHT FOR THE WORLD in Austria, Belgium and Czech Republic in order to strengthen the collaboration in the program countries and to improve opportunities to distribute funds and resources. *In the same year, LIGHT FOR THE WORLD established a child sponsorship program to intensify and expand support for children with disabilities in developing countries. *In 2009 a cross-border Unit of Programme Support and International Advocacy (UPSA) was established. It contends for the rights of people with disabilities to establish a sustainable development policy on a European and international level. *In 2010, Austrian LICHT F√úR DIE WELT and Dutch Dark and Light struck an agreement with regard to projects on which they collaborated. LIGHT FOR THE WORLD Austria took over responsibility for projects in Ethiopia and Pakistan, and Dark and Light did the same on Nepal and Sudan. *In 2011, Dark and Light joined the confederation and rebranded itself LIGHT FOR THE WORLD The Netherlands. *In 2012, Dark and Light changed its name to LIGHT FOR THE WORLD The Netherlands.  Key activities  Initially, prevention of blindness and restoration of eyesight were the most important sector focus in the programmatic work of Light for the World. Recent years have seen a widening of scope towards the promotion of Inclusive Education, Community Based Rehabilitation, and Disability Rights, all of which now feature prominently on the organisation's website.http://www.light-for-the-world.org/what-we-do/ Light for the World commits itself to strengthening the rights of persons with disabilities and creating new opportunities, increasing mobility with the help of devices and starting initiatives that will provide education and incomes. Another objective is to raise awareness on the inclusion of persons with disabilities in their family and social environment as well as in international, regional and national contexts. Raising public awareness on the situation of persons with disabilities in developing countries vis a vis United Nations and European Union bodies and other international actors forms an important part of Light for the World's work. As stated in their activity report, Light for the World is currently active in the following partner countries: Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, South Sudan, Mozambique, Rwanda, DR Congo, Tanzania, Uganda, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Northeast India, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Bolivia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina.

The organization was substantially similar to that of the Australian Armyhttp://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/structure/army_detailed_structure.asp and the British Army with three sections to the platoon and three platoons to the Rifle Company. Section composition The section was led by a corporal armed with a submachine gun (the Thompson Sub-machine gun at the beginning of the war and the Sten Gun starting to replace it from 1942http://www.canadiansoldiers.com/weapons/smgs/thompson.htm for the remainder), with the second in command being a lance-corporal, who had the responsibility of positioning the two-man Bren light machine gun team (one man firing, the other loading). The Bren team was responsible for the operation of the Light Machine Gun (LMG). During combat, this three man element would provide a base of covering fire while the remainder of the section (six privates armed with the No. 4 Lee‚ÄìEnfield Rifle,up to mid 1943 the earlier SMLE Mark III and their corporal commanding) would flank the enemy in an effort to either capture or kill them.Clouter, Edmond Infantry Training, Part VIII. - Fieldcraft, Battle Drill, Section and Platoon Tactics, Pg 35, 1944 Ottawa Flanking element The corporal carried five magazines for his sub- machine gun; these would have had 20 rounds of .45 ACP ammunition in the case of the Thompson or 32 rounds of 9mm ammunition for the Sten. He would also carry two grenades; the most common type being the No.36M (known as the \\"Mills Bomb\\"). The remaining privates would be armed with the 10-shot No.4 Mk I Lee‚ÄìEnfield bolt-action rifle and the accompanying spike bayonet. They would each carry 50 rounds of .303 ammunition in five round stripper clips, as well as one Mills bomb.Bouchery, Jean From D-day to VE-day: The Canadian Soldier Pg 26 2003 Paris Histoire & Collections Light Machine Gun element The Lance- corporal would have been armed similarly to the privates, except he was also outfitted with a machete. This was used to create a vantage point for the LMG if there was a need for a position within a densely wooded area. In addition to carrying the standard 50 rounds of Enfield rifle ammunition, he would also carry four 30 round magazines for the Bren gun (which also used the .303 rifle cartridge). The Lance-corporal would have been the only one within the machine gun element to carry a Mills bomb; this would likely have been used in the event that his position was being overrun. The private responsible for firing the Bren was known as a ‚ÄúNumber One‚Äù and was not required to carry a rifle as the Bren itself weighed a cumbersome 22 pounds.Crowell, Thomas Y The Encyclopedia of Infantry Weapons of World War Two New York New York 1977 Pg 72 He was required to carry four magazines of LMG ammunition and the ‚ÄúBren wallet‚Äù, which was a small cleaning kit for his weapon. The one loading the LMG was known as the ‚ÄúNumber Two‚Äù and was armed with a Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifle and 50 rounds of ammunition. Due to his role alongside the Number One, he would also have to carry four Bren gun magazines and a case containing a spare barrel for the LMG and any extra parts that might be required (such as springs, screws etc.)Jean Bouchery,From D-day to VE-day: The Canadian Soldier Paris 2003 Histoire & Collections Pg 26 The small-scale tactic of using a fire base with a flanking group was also employed on a larger scale by a platoon, with, for example, one section acting as a fire base, while the other two flank a position.Clouter, Edmond Canadian Army Training Pamphlet No. 1: A General Instructional Background for the Young Soldier, Published in Ottawa 1942 Pg 134 Notes and references External links *https://web.archive.org/web/20140806003443/http://www.bayonetstrength.150m.com/toe/CdnInfantry/rifle%20company.htm Military units and formations of Canada in World War II Canadian Army ","title":"Organization of Canadian Army rifle sections during World War II"},{"id":"21167178","text":"The 1893 Shamrock, built by the Mimna Brothers, is Canada's second oldest registered car and first internal combustion engine. The oldest car in Canada is the 1867 Henry Seth Taylor Steam Buggy built in Stanstead, Quebec.http://www.canadiancar.technomuses.ca/eng/espace_dexposition- showroom/voiture_a_vapeur_taylor-seth_taylor_steam_buggy History William Mimna and his brother Charles were stonemasons who lived in the small town of Wardsville, located on the Thames River, north of Chatham, Ontario. The brothers began a quest to build their own automobile in 1893. William worked on the car in Wardsville, Ontario for many years on his own without much help from anyone else. In 1904 he finally finished his vehicle, and some speculation has been put into the year the vehicle should be placed in. However one Wardsville resident remembers the vehicle in its early years back in 1893, and thus the vehicle has been dated to that year.Baechler, Glenn and Hugh Durnford. \\"Cars of Canada\\". Mclelland and Stewart Limited: Toronto:1973. The making of the car was originally inspired by steam locomotives, however William decided that gas-powered engines was going to rule the day in transportation so this is what he built. The car ran on one cylinder, put together from whatever parts the two brothers could find in Montreal, Hamilton, Toronto and Detroit, Michigan. Instead of a transmission the Shamrock had a system of belts and clutches helping it to run. The vehicle was named Shamrock the First, and without being aware of it the Mimna Brothers became a part of Canadian history.http://wardsville.wordpress.com/2008/03/18/wardsvilles-shamrock-the- first-registered-car-company-in-canada/ Problems and competition from Henry Ford Canada's first registered car and first internal combustion engine vehicle was not exactly successful however. The vehicle was unable to climb hills with its homemade engine, so the brothers decided to replace their engine with a French one, in hopes that it would have more power and be more efficient. However this did not help as the vehicle still would not climb hills or exceed 10 miles per hour, on level ground. In 1910, six years after completing the car, the brothers made some improvements by adding pneumatic tires and a steering wheel. By this time however Henry Ford was already mass- producing his own vehicle in Detroit. In 1893 Ford was promoted at the Edison Illuminating Company in Detroit to Chief Engineer giving him the time and money to devote his time to the creation and mass manufacturing of the automobile. In 1914, the brothers had a renewed interest in the vehicle and built Shamrock the Second, from stock parts from other cars. This car was built exactly the same as the First but was faster. This speed was not such a positive thing however, especially with the lack of a proper braking system. William hit a cow in his hometown, and the car was thus totalled and never salvaged. Today Shamrock the First rests at the Canadian Transportation Museum and Heritage Village, where it still runs. This museum is located in Kingsville, Ontario, just outside the Detroit-Windsor border, and is home to over 60 vehicles, covering all forms of Canadian automotive history.http://www.ctmhv.com/ References Shamrock Cars of Canada ","title":"1893 Shamrock"},{"id":"21167183","text":"Zukunft may refer to: * Paul F.

The program, which originally featured unique segments including world weather, lifestyle-oriented weather, and light weather news, debuted in 2001 as the first of multiple weekend programs on The Weather Channel. Program history Weekend Now launched in April 2001 on The Weather Channel as Weekend:Now, two months before the debut of the channel's \\"Live By It\\" campaign (even though promotions for the new campaign were already airing), as part of The Weather Channel's shift from one all-day program (that being Weather Center) to multi-hour shows with set hosts and tone. The show was unique at the time it was originally hosted by four on- camera meteorologists consisting of two teams, and broadcast from 7 to 11 a.m. ET. One team was Kelly Cass and Bill Keneely and the other team was Melissa Barrington and Bob Stokes. Any given hour of the program would be hosted by one team while a member of the other team provided special segments like the Travel Forecast and Weather Maker. Graphics were distinct from the rest of The Weather Channel, using a blue-green color scheme - and most notably, the voiceovers of Bob Stokes and Kelly Cass for the local forecast introduction. Among the segments were World Weather Watch, a look at weather in Latin American countries with meteorologists from The Weather Channel Latin America; Weekend Wow!, where extraordinary weather would be featured; and local and national forecasts; and Weather Maker, where one of the on-camera meteorologists not hosting that particular hour would use a telestrator to explain the meteorological details behind the day's most important weather system. In 2003, the show's format and timeslot was given to a new show titled Weekend Planner while Weekend:Now was renamed Weekend Now and aired from 11am-2pm Eastern Time. The show in the new timeslot, unlike the original program, contained much less in the way of special segments and was much more like other programs on the network such as Weather Center and PM Edition. Directly after the relaunch, the show retained some semblance of the original program, such as using the telestrator for the Travel segment, but by the time of the next network relaunch in 2005, the program had little if anything in common with its original format. On Saturday, August 2, 2008, the program began airing in high-definition. Weekend Now was the longest-running of the three weekend-only weather programs on The Weather Channel at the time, as Weekend View was broadcast from October 1, 2005 to September 12, 2013, and Weekend Outlook, was aired between 2003 and 2009. The show had its first official anchors in November 2004: Kevin Robinson and Kristina Abernathy. In September 2007, Abernathy left the show and was replaced by Jennifer Lopez. Shortly after that, in June 2008, Lopez left the show and was replaced by Kim Perez (now Kim Cunningham). In March 2009, Kim Perez left for PM Edition and Kevin Robinson left for Your Weather Today. Carl Parker and Heather Tesch replaced them beginning March 7, 2009. In November 2010, Parker and Tesch started anchoring Day Planner five days a week. Soon, Maria LaRosa and Todd Santos replaced them. In April 2012, Maria LaRosa left the show to host First Outlook and Your Weather Today. On April 14, 2012, Heather Tesch returned to Weekend Now as the new host, along with Todd Santos. Julie Martin joined the show in June 2012 as a digital media correspondent and hosting various segments on the show. Heather Tesch departed Weekend Now and Weather Center Live as well as The Weather Channel on October 30, 2012. Todd Santos also departed the show soon after for Weather Center Live. The new anchors of Weekend Now became Danielle Banks and Alex Wallace. In April 2013, Banks went on maternity leave. She returned to TWC in July 2013 as a fill-in. She was replaced by Alexandra Wilson. September 8 was Alexandra Wilson's last day on Weekend Now. She went on to anchor Weather Center Live weeknights 7-8pm and 10-11pm to replace Crystal Egger. No anchor was announced to join Alex Wallace. If there was an ongoing, significant weather event (severe weather outbreak, winter storm, hurricane threatening the U.S.), Weekend Now was extended one hour and finished at 3pm. On November 10, 2013, Weekend Now aired its final broadcast after more than 13 years. It was replaced by the new all- day Weather Center Live program on November 16, as part of the 2013 relaunch of the Weather Channel. =Former hosts= * Kristina Abernathy (2004-2007) (now no longer at The Weather Channel) * Danielle Banks (2012-2013) (left for maternity leave, returned to anchor Weather Center Live overnight) * Kim Cunningham (Perez) (2008-2009) (left to anchor PM Edition; now anchors Weather Center Live) * Maria LaRosa (2010-2012) (left to anchor First Forecast and Morning Rush) * Jennifer Lopez (2007-2008) (left The Weather Channel in 2008, but returned in 2013 and is now a fill-in) * Carl Parker (2009-2010) (left to anchor Day Planner; departed to become Storm Specialist for Day Planner and Weather Center Live) * Kevin Robinson (2004-2009) (left to anchor Your Weather Today, then departed to anchor Weather Center; then left The Weather Channel in December 2009; now at WLWT-TV) * Todd Santos (2010-2012) (left for Weather Center Live) * Heather Tesch (2009-2010, 2012) (left in November 2010 for Day Planner; returned in April 2012; left the show and departed The Weather Channel on October 30, 2012) * Alex Wallace (2012-2013) (program cancellation) * Alexandra Wilson (2013) (left Weekend Now for Weather Center Live) References The Weather Channel original programming 2001 American television series debuts 2010s American television series ","title":"Weekend Now"},{"id":"21167268","text":"Daniels at the 1964 Olympic Trials Billie Patricia \\"Pat\\" Daniels (in first marriage Winslow, in second marriage Bank, in third marriage Connolly; born September 1, 1943) is a retired female pentathlete and track and field coach from the United States, who was the U.S. track and field national champion in the 800 m in 1960 and 1961 and in the pentathlon from 1961 to 1967 and in 1970.

Often, large organizations have many of these functions performed by a specialist department, such as personnel or human resources, but all line managers are still required to supervise and administer the activities and ensure the well- being of the staff that report to them. Staff managers include people who lead revenue consuming departments, for example, accounting, customer service, or human resources. They serve the line managers of the organization in an advisory or support capacity by providing them with information and advice. Furthermore, staff managers usually do not make operating decisions. Staff management may involve moving a workforce around and utilizing human resources. Within staff management there is also line management, which involves the hierarchy system of the organization. Human resources and line management are often aligned as they both involve employees of any given organization. See explanation of staff and line. Human resources Human resources (HR) refers to any activity within a business, company, or organization used to deal with the management of its employees. These tasks can include employment, training, growth, and improvement. A number of large- scale, global or international organizations might also do internal job postings to save money or time. The main goal of human resourcing is to: \\"drive innovation, productivity and share price through mobilizing the workforce towards excellence\\". This was recognized by David Ulrich, who is thought to be the pioneer of HR (Human Resource Champions Book 1996). Human resources, in general, has great importance for almost every business or organization. Another name for human resources is personnel, though this is outdated. Human resources is so highly valued that some organizations share HR systems with other organizations through outsourcing. This creates an environment similar to a partnership as they may share similar systems and gain the ability to transfer employees to areas where they are most needed. Human resource planning is needed for staffing, to consider the skills, knowledge, and attributes needed when hiring new employees. HR staff will also gauge the number of employees needed, and examine people believe to be the most qualified. Line management Line management is a chain of commands within the hierarchy system of an organization. The person with the highest level of command in an organization is the CEO (chief executive officer). It can be difficult to transfer information from the lowest-ranked employees in an organization to the CEO, as the information flow to the CEO is often very limited. CEOs generally share information among higher position stakeholders, for example, directors, chairmen, system or product developers, and other stakeholders who have authority. Lower level employees, workers and those who tend to have more of a relationship with their customers or the audience for whom they are trying to direct a product, receive their information over the line of command. Another name for them is the workforce, as they are the people who help with the sales or manufacturing of an organization for the most part. The workforce consists of managers, sales assistants, manufacturers and shop assistants. Responsibilities and liabilities The organization is responsible for every employee in a company if something goes wrong. Employees can receive compensation for any serious incidents that may have occurred such as health and safety violations or injuries operating machinery, for example. Another example is the case of a supplier to British retailer Primark. The supplier's factory was located in the Rana Plaza building in Bangladesh. The building collapsed on April 24, 2013 killing 1100 people. The company was forced to pay the victims ¬£12 million in damages. This was considered a liability and became a debt that the company was forced to pay. In this case, Primark's human resources systems became spread out and difficult to monitor. This is why large corporations have a number of issues when it comes to ethics and accountability. Companies such as Primark are so large that one part of their business may be dealing with a corrupt or negligent foreign firm and the stakeholders, CEO, or other employees may not have sufficient information about the firm or factory abroad. If an organization owes money to an employee as compensation because of mistreatment, then this counts as a liability for the business. Slow or non-payment of compensation may become an issue of workers rights and ethics.

The trial consisted of 193 students and other ‚Äúrevolutionaries‚Äù charged with populist ‚Äúunrest‚Äù and propaganda against the Russian Empire. The Trial of the 193 was the largest political trial in Tsarist Russia.Billington, James H., Fire in the Minds of Men: Origins of Revolutionary Faith,(Transaction Publishers, 1999) p.405 The trial ended in mass acquittals, with only a small percentage being punished with sentences of hard labor or prison,Hingley, Ronald, Nihilists: Russian Radicals and Revolutionaries in the Reign of Alexander II 1855-81 (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1967) p.79 and consequently led to an increase in violent militancy among formerly peaceful revolutionaries.Hingley, Ronald, p.79  Background  Arrests of the 193 began as early as the ‚ÄúMad Summer of 1874‚Äù, when thousands of students and other youth called Narodnichestvo (peasant populism) took to the countryside to educate local peasants on issues of the government in hopes of making a more militant peasantry.Pereira, N.G.O., Tsar- Liberator: Alexander II of Russia 1818-1881, (Oriental Research Partners, Newtonville, Ma, 1983) p. 148 However, the peasantry were largely unreceptive to the revolutionaries' ideas, and were thus willing to turn them over to the authorities.Field, Daniel ‚ÄòPeasants and Propagandists in the Russian Movement to the People of 1874‚Äô, Journal of Modern History, vol. 59 (1987). From this point forward, strategy turned to focus on the seat of state power. In 1876, a demonstration in St. Petersburg led to further arrests.Pereira, N.G.O., p.149  Trial  In reaction to these demonstrations and the general social foment, Tsar Alexander II came to the conclusion that mass arrests and trials were necessary to halt the revolutionaries and discredit their fight.Woloch, Isser, Revolution and the Meanings of Freedom in the Nineteenth Century, (Stanford University Press, 1996) p.337 The Trial of the 193 was open for public viewing and for full press coverage, as the Tsar‚Äôs reforms of the legal system allowed it to be so.Chapman, Tim, Imperial Russia, 1801-1905, (Routledge, 2001) p.117 The trial served as a staging ground and audience for the prisoners to perform well-rehearsed speeches and allowed them to gain the support of public opinion.Chapman, Tim, p.117 Prisoners also shouted abuses at the judges, who from time to time had to postpone court due to the lack of control over the prisoners.Hingley, Ronald, p.78  Outcome  Punishments resulting from the trials were quite lenient and somewhere between half and 153 prisoners were acquitted.Woloch, Isser, p.339 This of course meant that a great majority of the political prisoners rounded up in the mass arrests ordered by Tsar Alexander II were held in captivity for possibly years without sufficient evidence for a conviction. This further led to the turn from peaceful protest to violent terrorism. Two acquitted prisoners from the Trial of the 193, Sofia Perovskaya and Alexander Zheliabov, would be involved in the planning of the successful assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II‚Äôs life.

Originally chambered in .45-70, .45-90 WCF and .40-82 WCF, it was later offered in a half dozen other large cartridges, including the .50-110 Winchester. Despite being originally designed for use with black powder, the action was strong enough to make the jump to smokeless powder with only minor modifications, and was subsequently chambered in the smokeless .33 WCF cartridge beginning in 1903. History The Model 1886 continued the trend towards chambering heavier rounds, and had an all-new and considerably stronger locking-block action than the toggle-link Model 1876. It was designed by John Moses Browning, who had a long and profitable relationship with Winchester from the 1880s to the early 1900s. William Mason also contributed, making some improvements to Browning's original design. In many respects the Model 1886 was a true American express rifle, as it could be chambered in the more powerful black powder cartridges of the day, proving capable of handling not only the .45-70 but also .45-90 and the huge .50-110 Express \\"buffalo\\" cartridges.Barnes, Frank C., ed. by John T. Amber. \\".577/500 Magnum Nitro Express\\", in Cartridges of the World, p.116.\\"Winchester's Big 50\\", American Rifleman. The action was strong enough that a nickel-steel barrel was the only necessary modification needed to work with smokeless powder cartridges, and in 1903 the rifle was chambered for the smokeless high-velocity .33 WCF cartridge. During the early stages of World War I, the Royal Flying Corps purchased Model 1886 rifles chambered for the .45-90 Sharps cartridge with special incendiary bullets designed to ignite the hydrogen gas in German airships.Mercaldo, Luke & Vanderlinden, Anthony (June 2015). \\"Winchester Lever-Actions go to War\\". American Rifleman. p. 53. In 1935 Winchester introduced a slightly modified M1886 as the Model 71, chambered for the more powerful .348 Winchester cartridge. Soon after the introduction of the Model 1886, Browning designed a scaled-down version of the 1886 action for smaller dual-use or carbine cartridges, which was issued as the highly successful Winchester Model 1892. The 1886 was offered, on a custom basis, in the rare 32-Gauge shotshell. These rifles were especially chambered, and barreled for the 32-Gauge shotshell.Barnes, Frank C., ed. by John T. Amber. \\"32-Gauge\\" in the 11th Edition of \\"Cartridges of The World\\", p. 502 The Winchester 1886 was featured in a minor role in the 2004 video-game Half-Life 2.

The case dealt with whether or not to extradite an escaped slave to the United States on the charge of murder. The majority of the presiding judges who handled the case agreed that there was sufficient evidence to prove criminality of the extraditable offence. The decision was based upon the terms laid out in Article X of the Webster‚ÄìAshburton Treaty of 1842. Anderson was released, however, on a technicality. Background John Anderson was an African-American slave who escaped to Canada, evading the pursuit of bounty hunters. While on the run he killed a farmer from Howard County, Missouri. Anderson stabbed the farmer, Seneca Digges, who died shortly after. Digges intended to legally recapture Anderson, and ultimately send him back into his master‚Äôs custody. Anderson lived and worked in Canada West from 1854 to April 1860, managing to keep a low profile. He was eventually arrested and held by Magistrate William Matthews in Brantford, Ontario. Legal and political significance From the Illustrated London News 1861 Some have argued that the Anderson case, aside from igniting a media, legal, and political frenzy, had a profound impact on Canada‚Äôs future relationship with Britain (Brode 1989, Farwell 1912, Reinders 1975). It also set an important precedent for Canadian leaders to make the superior courts handle the most political divisive decisions, which had originally been reserved for the executive branch of government.Patrick Brode (1989), The Odyssey of John Anderson, pp. 107‚Äì108, The Osgoode Society, Toronto. John Anderson's motive for escape arose following his sale to another farmer. He realized he would never see his family again in such a situation, and this was unbearable. He hoped to become a legitimate free man and work so he could earn enough money to purchase his family out of bondage. Escape to Canada became his only option after he allegedly killed Missouri farmer Seneca Digges \\"by accident\\" when an attempt on his capture was made by Digges. When Anderson got to Canada there were wanted posters everywhere. The Canadian citizenry and the government at the time engaged in heated debate over whether it was acceptable for Anderson to live free in their country. Some people thought that he was dangerous and might end up killing Canadian farmers. Others denied feeling any threat of danger from the man, and argued for him to stay. Assistance Anti-slavery associations from Britain and pre-Confederation Canada played an instrumental role in assisting Anderson before, during, and after the case. Sir John A. Macdonald, made use of public funds to foot the bill for Anderson‚Äôs legal defences.J. K. Johnson and Carole B. Stelmack, eds (1969) Papers of the Prime Ministers: Volume II; The Letters of Sir John A. Macdonald 1858‚Äì1861, p. 357, Public Archives of Canada, Ottawa. Britain attempts to intervene A crucial feature in the whole situation occurred while Anderson was awaiting an appeal of the Canadian court‚Äôs initial decision, which stipulated that he should indeed be extradited. The British Court of Queen‚Äôs Bench attempted to interfere by sending a writ of habeas corpus for him to appear before a court in London, England, to Britain's Canadian subjects who were already in the process of handling the situation. \\"Not only was the writ ‚Äòan evil precedent‚Äô, but it could lead to further conflict between English and Canadian judicatures.\\"Robert C. Reinders, \\"The John Anderson Case, 1860‚Äì1, A Study in Anglo-Canadian Imperial Relations\\" (1975), The Canadian Historical Review, Vol. 56:4 p. 407, University of Toronto Press, Toronto. The English courts never got their chance to handle the case because Anderson‚Äôs appeal was expedited to the Court of Common Pleas. He was released due to faulty wording in the warrant. Reactions The issue with the English writ, and the negative reaction to it, uncovered the need for written clarification of the relationship between English and Canadian courts. As one result, the Habeas Corpus Act 1862 was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1862, which denied British courts the right to issue writs of habeas corpus for British colonies or dominions with their own courts capable of doing so. It reaffirmed that Canadian jurisdictions had become self-sufficient and did not take kindly to interferences in their judicial system.Brode (1989), p. 118. It is a significant case to study in Canada‚Äôs legal, political, and social heritage.

It is part of the Diocese of Huron and is a member of the Anglican Church of Canada. The Chapel of Ascension, as it was formerly called was founded on May 11, 1893 and the current church is still holding their services at the original location on London Street, now called University Avenue. Early in its existence the parish was served by the rectors and curates of their sister church, All Saints Anglican Church, Windsor. Prior to the construction of the original frame church people would gather at the site and hold services. Church of the Ascension grew until it was a large enough congregation and as a result they received their first official rector in 1905. Early history The church has been rebuilt and refurbished throughout its history. As the church grew the original frame structure became too small and as a result it was demolished and construction of a larger brick building started in August 1907 when the cornerstone of the new building was placed. The new church building was dedicated on May 31, 1908. This structure was destroyed by fire of unknown causes on December 22, 1926. The only items that were saved from the fire were the altar linens, communion vessels and the parish hall. Services were held in the parish hall while the church was being rebuilt. The new cornerstone was laid in 1927 and the re-building of the church commenced. The church was re- dedicated on December 4, 1927, after construction was completed. The church building and property have seen many changes and additions through the years, funds for which were mainly donated by its parishioners. Improvements have included new stained glass windows, a new organ, and a rectory, the renovation of the parish hall, a parking lot, air conditioning, and a new office built in 1988. 1990 arson A second fire occurred on January 14, 1990. The cause of this fire was arson. Much of the church was destroyed, but restoration work began immediately. While the restoration was taking place services were held at a local school, and eventually in the parish hall which survived the fire with minor damage. Members of the church were able to save several items from destruction including the cross, altar cloths, silver, candlesticks, church records, the church Bible and many of the pews. The stained glass windows in the church were rebuilt using the original glass and new lead as the original lead of the windows had buckled from the heat of the fire. The church was rededicated in November 1990 with many local dignitaries in attendance. The church today The church has continued to add additions to its building and grounds including a Memorial Garden, which has utilized some of the charred beams from the church, a new church sign, paintings in the parish hall and nursery and a new stained glass window, installed in 1993, which faces the street and celebrates the church's centennial.

Wrapped around its northern and western flanks is a narrow band of Carboniferous Limestone which gives rise to a karst landscape. The Twrch Fechan Fault defines its eastern margin and brings Old Red Sandstone rocks into contact with the limestone on this flank. A number of major shakeholes in the Basal Grit adorn these eastern flanks, one of which, known as 'Pwll Cynrig' is flooded.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 map sheet 230 'Ammanford' Archaeology On the summit are two prehistoric cairns known as Carnau'r Garreg Las. A further cairn, known as Carn y Gigfran, lies a few hundred metres to the north of Carreg yr Ogof. They are likely to be of British Bronze Age date like so many of the stone barrows and cairns along the length of the Brecon Beacons. A round barrow on Fan Foel was excavated in 2002-4 and showed a date of about 2000 BC with two separate burials in the cairn. However, it was low and small compared with the large stone cairns. It is also likely that both cairns and barrows possess multiple interments, again like other cairns in the area. What makes them interesting is their great size of about 20 metre diameter, indicating their importance to the prehistoric local community. Access The hill is entirely classed as open country and therefore freely available to walkers.

A religious man, LeBel took his first vows on August 10, 1918, and a year later attended the Catholic-run Assumption College (1919‚Äì20) in Windsor, Ontario. He then moved back to Toronto where he studied at St. Michael's College for four years (1920‚Äì24) and the University of Toronto (1924) where he received his B.A. While at St. Michael's, LeBel was a skilled athlete, named \\"Captain and Star\\" of his championship winning football team. LeBel was Chaplain of the Essex Scottish Regiment in Windsor for fourteen years, including all of World War II. In 1925, LeBel was ordained a priest and in 1931 he received his M.A. from the University of Chicago. He became a professor of English at the University of Saskatoon (1931‚Äì39), and later held the same post at both the University of Toronto (1939‚Äì41) and Assumption College (1941‚Äì47). Following six years of teaching at Assumption College, LeBel was appointed dean (1947‚Äì52), a title he held until Assumption College became Assumption University. During his tenure as Dean of the College, LeBel and his administration pushed for a more open community school of higher learning. After winning affiliation with Essex College and Canterbury College, the Ontario legislature renamed Assumption College to Assumption University of Windsor, making it an official school of the community, though it was still Catholic-oriented. LeBel was named the first President of Assumption University (1952‚Äì63). The new university grew rapidly and became dependent on government funding for its survival, becoming the University of Windsor in 1963, which marked the switch from a Catholic university to a public university.The University of Windsor- A Special Study. LeBel was again named the first President, this time of the University of Windsor. He held the post for one year before retiring in 1964. He was succeeded as President by John Francis Leddy. LeBel died on August 11, 1986.

It has been suggested she was the model for two paintings by Goya, La maja desnuda (The Naked Maja) and La maja vestida (The Clothed Maja).The Clothed Maja Museo del Prado Tud√≥ was born in C√°diz and she was always called \\"Pepita\\", a diminutive of Josefa. Her father was a gunner named Antonio de Tud√≥ y Alemany who died when she was young. Since the age of sixteen, Pepita and her mother, Catalina Cathal√°n y Luecia, and her sisters, Magdalena and Socorro, lived in the house of Manuel de Godoy, one of the most powerful men in Spain. Pepita was his lover by 1800. However, the Queen of Spain, Mar√≠a Luisa, forced Godoy to marry Mar√≠a Teresa de Borb√≥n y Vallabriga, Countess of Chinch√≥n, a marriage which was favorable to Godoy for social reasons. The marriage did not end Godoy's relationship with Pepita; in 1805, she gave birth to a son, Manuel, and in 1807, she gave birth to another son, Luis. In 1807, under Godoy's influence, Carlos IV presented Pepita with the title of Countess of Castillo Fiel and Viscountess of Rocafuerte. When Mar√≠a Teresa died in November 1828, Godoy and Pepita could finally marry, even though they had secretly performed a marriage ceremony years earlier. The following year or still in December of 1828, Godoy and Pepita married. The Pope made him 1st Principe di Paserano; however, they moved to Paris in 1832 where they lived in somewhat straitened circumstances. Godoy was later given a pension by Louis Philippe I. Later, Pepita returned to Spain in hopes of reclaiming the family properties. At ninety years old, Pepita told a reporter that Godoy knew only one true love: Queen Mar√≠a Luisa. She died in 1869 in Madrid. In popular culture Pepita is considered by many historians to be the model for one of Francisco de Goya's most notorious works, La maja desnuda. The writer Ceferino Palencia wrote a play called Pepita Tud√≥, obviously inspired by Pepita herself and cast his half-Scottish wife Isabel Oyarz√°bal Smith in the titular role in the 1930s.

In 2013 the game was re-released as Freeware and open-source software. Gameplay The game is divided up into quests made up of multiple separate levels which are each against different foes in different areas with different end goals. The player chooses a character between eleven default characters: Knight, Paladin, Rogue, Mercenary, Sailor, Magician, Priest, Citizen, Mage, Warlock, and Archer. According to the promotion, the game is overall set, \\"In the underground catacombs of the castle Arius,\\" but only a few levels actually are.  History  =Development and release= United Software Artists developed for Amulets & Armor an own Doom-like 2.5D game engine. As map format was the Doom one used so that there available tools for creation could be used. The targeted platform was the PC with MS-DOS, utilizing a 256 color VGA graphics mode with 320x200 resolution. Beyond the Doom-like capabilities had the game's engine RPG features like various character classes, a magic system, character advancement and inventory system, a hunger and thirst mechanic, and a detailed level construction system. The game was somewhat noteworthy for its implementation of features commonly associated with fantasy RPG games in a first person shooter engine before this was common (while it did not innovate these features). The much more famous Ultima Underworld games implemented similar features a half-decade earlier with comparable VGA/MIDI production values. Although a more apt comparison is perhaps The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall released by Bethesda Softworks the previous year with similar features, which became much more famous. To set the game's graphic capabilities in perspective, Quake, one of the first fully 3D and textured games, came out the previous year and Quake II came out the same year as Amulets & Armor. The game was released in 1997 after two years of development as shareware on disc, including a musical score (both CD quality and MIDI versions of the music were available on the disc).

It has been labelled by the national government's former Housing Minister Lindiwe Sisulu as \\"the biggest housing project ever undertaken by any Government.\\" Even though it is a joint endeavour by the National Department of Housing, the provincial government of the Western Cape and the City of Cape Town, a private company, Thubelisha, has been outsourced to find contractors, manage, and implement the entire project. Thubelisha estimates that some 25,000 units will be constructed, about 70% of which will be allocated to shack-dwellers, and 30% to backyard dwellers on the municipal housing waiting lists. Delft, 40 km outside of Cape Town, is the main site of the Project. The N2 Gateway is a highly controversial project and has been criticised by the Geneva-based Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions, by the South African Auditor General, by popular organisations such as the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign, by Constitutional Court experts such as Pierre De Vos and by affected residents themselves. Its detractors claim that the N2 Gateway is a beautification project for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. They cite government documents prioritising the development in light of its visibility near to the Cape Town Airport. They also cite the mass evictions that have taken place moving shackdwellers off the N2 corridor into Delft. The South African government has stated that 14,000 homes housing 70,000 people at a cost of R2 billion was delivered by 2015.  Joe Slovo Phase 1  To make way for Joe Slovo Phase 1 (a.k.a. N2 Gateway Phase 1), about 1,000 Joe Slovo residents were moved to Temporary Relocation Areas (TRAs) in Delft. After the January 2005 fire, which destroyed 3000 shacks and made 12,000 people homeless, Joe Slovo residents were promised priority in the allocation of N2 Gateway housing. The original plan was for 12,000 rental units to be built during Joe Slovo Phase 1 on the land taken during a massive fire in Joe Slovo in January 2005. Eventually, only 705 houses in that phase were built. It is reported that only one Joe Slovo resident was able to afford the flats whose rents skyrocketed and forced new tenants into a year-long rent boycott. The boycott has been supported by residents of Joe Slovo Informal Settlement, social movements, such as the Anti-Eviction Campaign, and civil society. The Western Cape Housing MEC has recently admitted major structural defects to the Phase 1 flats saying that they may have to be demolished.  Joe Slovo Informal Settlement ‚Äì Phase 2 & 3  With Phase 1 of the N2 Gateway completed, the National Government ordered the eviction of the remaining 20,000 shackdwellers to Temporary Relocation Areas in Delft (see section below). Joe Slovo residents have opposed government's order that they be forcibly removed. Residents refused to be moved claiming that the government was not getting rid of the slums but just moving them far away to Deflt where there are no jobs, few schools and a higher rate of crime. It is reported that residents who had willingly moved to Delft after the fire in 2005 have lost their jobs because they cannot afford transport into Cape Town and since there is no railway line in Delft. After a Cape High Court ruling by controversial judge John Hlophe in favour of the Government, many experts in constitutional law have claimed the ruling to be unjust and against the South African Constitution. Since then, residents have appealed the decision and taken it to the South African Constitutional Court. In August 2008, about 200 Joe Slovo residents travelled by train, spent the night at the Methodist Church in Braamfontein, and arrived at the Constitutional Court to protest proposed evictions. They were accompanied in solidarity by the Anti-Eviction Campaign as well as residents from Symphony Way, an informal settlement that is also in conflict with the government over the N2 Gateway Housing Project. The community law centre of the University of the Western Cape and the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions were admitted as friends of the court in support of Joe Slovo residents. Judgment in the case was reserved in August 2008. On 10 June 2009, the Constitutional Court ruled in favour of the eviction of Joe Slovo residents but only based on certain conditions including that 70% of homes built on Joe Slovo land be allocated to Joe Slovo residents, that government must enter into consultation with residents, and that temporary relocation areas where residents were to be moved be of higher quality. In August 2009, new Minister for Human Settlements, Tokyo Sexwale, placed the eviction of residents on hold while Joe Slovo. In September 2009, reports surfaced that the Constitutional Court had quietly issued a new order suspending the eviction of Joe Slovo residents until further notice.  BNG Houses in Delft   Temporary Relocation Areas in Delft  Photo of Blikkiesdorp Temporary Relocation Area There are two Temporary Relocation Areas (TRAs) or transit camps that are connected to the N2 Gateway project in Delft. The Delft TRA (nicknamed Tsunami and Thubelisha), which was originally built by the ANC-led City of Cape Town for Joe Slovo fire victims and is now managed by Thubelisha Homes on behalf of the National Government, has become a centerpiece of the N2 Gateway strategy. It houses shack-dwellers who have been forcibly or voluntarily moved from shack settlements such as those in Joe Slovo, Khayelitsha, Crossroads, Nyanga and Gugulethu. According to a study of Tsunami by the Development Action Group, the establishment of the Delft TRA: * Has increased vulnerability of the households affected by the Joe Slovo fire, * Has heightened community conflict * Has and has had a huge financial cost to the municipality and possibly also to other government departments. According to DAG, in light of these costs and conditions, the policy intention is not achieved and the expense of establishing the TRA cannot be justified. In 2007, Chris Harris, a professor in the department of geological sciences at UCT, found chrysotile and crocidolite (a.k.a. asbestos) in material found in the Tsunami TRA. The other TRA is the Symphony Way TRA which has nicknamed 'Blikkiesdorp' (or 'Tin Can Town') by residents as well as pavement dwellers from a nearby informal settlement. This TRA is built and managed by the DA-led City of Cape Town. Symphony Way TRA is criticised for its barbed-wire fencing, police-controlled access to the camp, and its erosion of social networks.  Criticism  The N2 Gateway Housing Project has been mired in controversy. The Auditor General Report on the project found mismanagement and widespread deficiencies in the planning, accounting, design, construction, and execution of the housing development project. The Western Cape Housing MEC, Bonginkosi Madikizela, has admitted to serious defects in the N2 Gateway Phase 1 Flats saying that \\"Some of the units, it will not actually help to fix them. I think a possible solution which is something very difficult to do would be just to demolish the building you know and start afresh. In September 2009, the UN affiliated Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE) published a significant report criticising the N2 Gateway Project for its housing rights violations and for its lack of consultation with poor residents affected by the project.

Life and career  Born in Kuvno, Lithuania, Moses was fourteen years old when he, along with his father Ely Bilsky, migrated to Canada in 1845. They first moved to Montreal, before settling in Kemptville, Ontario. Eventually his father decided to move to Palestine to spend his remaining days, leaving his son in the care of relatives living in Brooklyn, New York. In either 1856 or 1857, Moses decided to move back to Canada, and was attracted to the city of Ottawa. He would become the first Jewish settler in the city. In the 1860s, Moses headed west to make a fortune in the Gold Rush. Eventually he returned to the East Coast, where he met his wife and started a family, and then moved to Ottawa with his family and opened a pawn shop in 1877. He later created a second business, a jewelry store, with his son Alexander in 1901 to form M. Bilsky and Son Limited. Both stores, located on Rideau Street, were successful. When Moses retired from the business in 1915, his business became known as Bilsky Limited.  Involvement in the Jewish Community  As Ottawa transformed from a bytown to the capital of Canada, Moses helped establish the Jewish community in the city. He established the first place of worship within his own residence. Once the Adath Jeshurun congregation outgrew his home in 1895, he helped found the first synagogue next to his shop on Murray Street, and later a more extravagant synagogue on King Edward Avenue in 1902. Not only was his home used as a place of worship for a period of time, but it was also used as a refuge for recently arrived Jewish immigrants. He and his wife welcomed many strangers into their home and helped them find work and establish new lives in Ottawa. He travelled to New York in order to acquire a Torah for his congregation, and would help transform the deceased to the closet Jewish community.  Personal In 1874, 43-year-old Moses met 17-year-old Pauline Reich, and they married within the year. In 1876, their first child, a son named Alexander, was born in New York. They would eventually have eleven more children. Soon after the birth of his first son, he moved his young family back to Ottawa where he started his business. Moses would spend most of the rest of his life in Ottawa, except for a period when he and his family lived in Mattawa (1882 to 1885) and Montreal (1885 to 1891). One of his daughters, Lillian Freiman (1885‚Äì1940), followed in her father's involvement in philanthropy. She served as head of the Canadian branch of WIZO and was recognized for her services for war veterans when she was awarded the Order of the British Empire.

Presocratics. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007.Graham, Daniel W. The Texts of Early Greek Philosophy. New York: Cambridge University Press,Graham, Daniel W.

They saw the world as something ordered and intelligible, its history following an explicable course and its different parts arranged in a comprehensible system. Most historians agree that Thales, one of the Seven Sages of Greece, started this movement by predicting a solar eclipse that actually occurred, though some believe this feat to be false.  Miletus  The Greek city of Miletus was the birthplace of Greek philosophy and Western scientific thought. Their culture combined the best of a resurgent Greek civilization with borrowings from Egypt and the Middle East. Internally, the politics of the Milesians were of faction, strife, and bloody revolution; externally, they were neighbored by two powerful empires in the Lydians and Persians. Despite these unfavorable circumstances, the Milesians were commercially indefatigable. With its three harbors and progeny of daughter colonies, Miletus was the ‚ÄúJewel of Ionia.‚Äù They traded not only with the Eastern empires, but also with Egypt; they sent out numerous colonies to settle in Thrace and along the coast of the Black Sea; and they had connections with Sybaris in southern Italy. Miletus bred Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes; the first three philosophers. Miletus was an essential location for this intellectual revolution to flourish because they had connections with the great civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Anatolia which in turn allowed for a vast array of exchange of goods and ideas from across the Mediterranean and three continents.  Rise of philosophy  Up until this point in time (6th century BC) the Greeks, and many empires before them, explained the events of the world as products of supernatural actions of divine agents. This can be seen in the writings of Homer and Hesiod, two famous Greek poets. With the introduction of rational and natural thought the Milesian Presocratic philosophers, as they were termed, attempted to produce an improved and rationalized theology in place of the anthropomorphic divinities of the Olympian pantheon. But their theology had little to do with religion, and they removed most of the traditional functions from the gods, such as thunder was no longer the growling of a minatory Zeus or that Poseidon created storms. This new Presocratic approach gave no direct credence to traditional lore and furthermore these philosophers simply ignored the kinds of explanations that were imbedded in myths and advanced their own accounts on the basis, not of tradition, but of reasons. Their approach refused to allow any supernatural actions to govern natural processes. This rejection of the supernatural did not make the philosophers atheists, rather it made them subordinate divine action to natural law which was known as Physis. These first philosophers offered reasons for their opinions and gave arguments for their views. For the most part, they were concerned not to advance opinions, but to advance reasoned opinions.  Milesian School  This school of thought is made up of the philosophies of three Presocratic philosophers: Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes. These philosophers all hailed from the Greek city state of Miletus and are known as the first philosophers. Their philosophy is what started the Ionian Intellectual Revolution. = Thales (c. 625 BCE ‚Äì 545 BCE) = According to Aristotle, Thales of Miletus was the ‚ÄúFounder of Natural Philosophy.‚Äù Even though he is recognized as the founder of philosophy much of what we know about him and his philosophy is up to debate because he left no writings for which early students of philosophy could rely on. Known as one of the Seven Sages, which was an exclusive club of poets and statesmen, he was the only one who could claim to be a philosopher and scientist. Thales is credited with being a political adviser, philosopher, scientist, mathematician, and engineer. Throughout his life he is alleged to have traveled and studied throughout the Mediterranean in places such as Egypt, Phoenicia, and Babylon which all influenced his philosophy and theories. Thales allegedly founded geometry, although he may have been taught this in Egypt, and also studied the stars. Thales tried to search for the arche, which can be translated to searching for the source for all things. He believed the source for all things (arche) was water. This is based on the notion that somehow all things, and more importantly all living things, originate in water and therefore water is the basic starting-point of everything. The apparent stability of the Earth became one phenomenon for which any self-respecting natural philosopher had to have an explanation, for Thales he believed the Earth rested upon water. = Anaximander (c. 610 BCE ‚Äì 540 BCE) = Anaximander was a pupil of Thales. Many historians start the beginning of Greek Philosophy and therefore the Ionian Intellectual Revolution with Anaximander since Thales did not leave any written records. Therefore, there is not any reliable information on Thales and the various elements of his thought and practice. Anaximander is responsible for the oldest surviving fragment of Greek philosophical writing. He, as with Thales, offered his own insight into what he believed the arche to be which for him was termed ‚Äúthe boundless‚Äù (apeiron). This boundless he describes as a principle that is neither water nor any of the other so called elements, but instead some different limitless nature. His principle of ‚Äúboundless‚Äù meant that if mass is anywhere, it is everywhere; at the same time, if empty space is limitless, body too must be limitless. He never explicitly states what this boundless principle is made up of and therefore creates an inevitable question for ancient and modern scholars. Anaximander also theorized about astronomical phenomena such as the distances of the sun, moon, and stars and about the origin and development of living things in the world. He was the first to try and draw the inhabited world on a tablet, and with the help of a traveler from Miletus this tablet was made more accurate. Throughout his life he provides explanations for the existence of the sea, wind, storms, thunder, lightning, and deals a lot with biology. = Anaximenes (c. 585 BCE ‚Äì 528 BCE) = Anaximenes was a pupil of Anaximander. Of the three philosophers of the Milesian school, Anaximenes is often thought of as the least important simply because he took Anaximander‚Äôs grand vision of cosmology and identified a mechanism by which it might operate. As with those before him, Anaximenes‚Äô arche was air (aer). His major philosophical advancement was to posit a clear and definite mechanism by which this aer is transformed into the various more familiar components of the world, thereby tying the world and the arche together. Anaximenes theory of change reported that air is the source of everything; there is a set of elements or basic stuffs: (i) fire, (ii) air, (iii) wind, (iv) cloud, (v) water, (vi) earth, (vii) stones, which are ordered by their relative density; and the condensation process is analogous to the action of felting. Anaximenes is usually viewed as the inventor of Material Monism, the theory by which there is only one substance (in this case air) of which all other stuffs are mere modifications or states.  Possible influences  Historians tend to debate on whether the early Greek philosophers were influenced by other ancient empires during the 6th century BC or were the first to think about theory and other sciences such as astrology. Below are some of the possible influencers of the Ionian Intellectual Revolution: = Babylon = Babylonians were known for their vast knowledge of the skies. Temple Priests kept detailed observations of the skies in order to report and anticipate ominous phenomena. Records of eclipses have been found from around 747 BC. The Babylonians also developed a complex system of mathematics based on the number sixty, which they used to track the motions of the sun and moon. Babylonian archives contained vast stores of mathematical and astronomical data on cuneiform tablets. The eclipse that Thales predicted, which began this movement, may have been done off the basis of Babylonian tablets. = Egypt = Egyptians were known for their vast knowledge of arithmetic. It is possible that Thales brought back a knowledge of ‚Äúgeometry‚Äù from Egypt. The roots of the Greek word mean ‚Äúearth-measurement‚Äù, indicating that kind of science he would have encountered there: practical surveying. Egyptians used scribes who had a knowledge of basic arithmetic on which to base practical questions of ordering supplies and the like. They used a simple but highly practical year of 365 days and made simple astronomical observations. = Philosophers bred from the movement = * Pythagoras * Alcmaeon * Xenophanes * Heraclitus * Archelaus * Parmenides * Melissus * Zeno * Empedocles * Hippasus * Philolaus * Hippo * Leucippus * Democritus * Anaxagoras See also * Ionian School (philosophy) * Milesian School * Pre- Socratic philosophy References Events in ancient Greek philosophy Ionia Miletus ","title":"Ionian Enlightenment"},{"id":"21167599","text":"David Watt is a Justice of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, to which he was appointed on October 12, 2007.

Finney, wife of revivalist Charles Grandison Finney.Steven Mintz, Moralists and Modernizers: America‚Äôs Pre-Civil War Reformers, (Baltimore: JHU Press, 1995), 69 The NYFMRS was created for the fundamental purpose of preventing prostitution in early 19th century New York. In time, the NYFMRS became one of the most well-known moral reform organizations of the period and even expanded its influence to other cities across America. Five years after its establishment, the NYFMRS already had 445 auxiliaries, and thus changed its name in 1839 to the American Female Moral Reform Society in the hopes that membership would expand even further. This name change came just a year after the Boston Female Moral Reform Society became the New England Female Moral Reform Society due to a growing rivalry for support among auxiliary societies in the Northeast.Introduction. Included in What Was the Appeal of Moral Reform to Antebellum Northern Women, 1835-1841?, by Daniel Wright and Kathryn Kish Sklar. (Binghamton, NY: State University of New York at Binghamton, 1999). Goals Moral reform became a prominent issue in America during the 1830s and 1840s and many organizations were created during this time to eliminate prostitution and the sexual double standard, and to also encourage sexual abstinence. While some organizations tried to reclaim women who had fallen into prostitution, moral reform societies like NYFMRS were convinced that prevention was their primary concern. Women involved in the New York Female Benevolent Society, who tended to be older women, were more willing to help prostitutes out of their situation.Daniel S. Wright, Kathryn Kish Sklar, What Was the Appeal of Moral Reform to Antebellum Northern Women, 1835-1841?, (Binghamton, NY: State University of New York at Binghamton, 1999). Prostitution first became a problem in America between 1810 and 1820, primarily because it was not completely illegal, thus it is estimated that 5 to 10 percent of women were prostitutes.Steven Mintz, Moralists and Modernizers: America‚Äôs Pre-Civil War Reformers, (Baltimore: JHU Press, 1995), 66-67. Women soon discovered that prostitution paid more than any other kind of work available to them at the time, and even some kinds of employment were linked to prostitution. A report by the NYFMRS in the 1830s found that servants, chambermaids, and milliners were the most common occupations linked with prostitution.Timothy J. Gilfoyle, City of Eros: New York City, Prostitution, and the Commercialization of Sex, 1790-1920, (New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 1992), 60. With estimates of more than ten thousand prostitutes in the city it can be understood that some women simply turned to prostitution out of necessity from the strains of their economic and environmental situations.Ronald G. Walters, American Reformers 1815-1860 , (HarperCollins, 1997), 179-180. Reform Strategies The NYFMRS attempted many strategies in preventing prostitution from occurring. Some of these strategies included entering brothels and praying for the prostitutes and their clients, lobbying the state to make male solicitation of prostitutes a crime and threatening to publish names in their monthly journal of the men who regularly visited brothels. Through time the NYFMRS took on new missions, primarily by relaxing their focus on prevention and opening up to the idea of homes for the friendless, offering education to those women in need and opening up an employment agency to help some respectable women.

The fair is held annually spanning over four days on Labour Day weekend. The Colchester South and Harrow Agriculture Society is responsible for coordinating the event. Their purpose is to promote awareness of agricultural activities and their importance to the community. The first Harrow Fair took place in 1854, at a time when fairs functioned more like sales. They were held quarterly and at different venues, and local farms would volunteer to host the event. Participants, those showing and selling their livestock, seed grains and varying implements required membership to the Colchester Agricultural Society. According to The Colchester South and Harrow Agriculture Society, initially livestock entries were limited to horses, fat cattle, milk cows, sheep, swine, and a few short horn Durham. Today, there is much more species diversity exhibited. The first annual Harrow Fair took place in 1878. The list of entries had expanded to include home arts exhibits such as crafts and cooking, as well as more diverse agricultural exhibits. In 1880, Colchester Township purchased of land in order to create establish a permanent fairground.The Colchester South and Harrow Agriculture Society Continual success, lead to further expansion in 1902, as well as developments to the grounds including perimeter fencing, planting trees, building a half mile track, and more. In 1907, the duration of the fair extended over three days. Further land expansion was limited in the 1950s when the high school board purchased the adjacent property. As a result, the livestock barns had to be relocated to a more isolated area. On its 115th anniversary in 1969, the Harrow Fair welcomed the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, William Ross MacDonald. He arrived to open the fair and celebrate its long life. In 1981 the Exhibition Hall burnt down. By 1983 a new Exhibition Hall was constructed which still stands today.Buchanan, Alan. 1993.

Many historic buildings remain in Old Sandwich Town and the area hosts an annual festival to celebrate its heritage. The area is now a neighbourhood of the city of Windsor. History This area south of what was named the Detroit River was initially inhabited by various First Nations, including the Ojibwa, Ottawa (known as Odawa), Potawatomi, all of which were Algonquin-speaking, and Wyandot peoples, also known as the Huron to the French. The Huron were an Iroquoian-speaking tribe. In 1747, the first Jesuit mission in Upper Canada was established in this area. A French colonial farming settlement formed near the mission and became known as Petite C√¥te, for being located near a bend in the Detroit River which shortened some of the riverfront frontage for the farm plots that extended into the interior. After Detroit became independent from Great Britain in 1796, resulting from the United States success in the western theatre of the American Revolutionary War, the Crown encouraged development at Sandwich on the opposite side of the river.Windsor Architectural Conservation Advisory Committee (WACAC). Historic Sandwich: Welcome to Ontario‚Äôs oldest, continuous European settlement 1797. (Windsor, Ontario: Windsor Architectural Advisory Committee, 1990). Most Loyalists from Detroit moved south of the Detroit River, to the Sandwich area. By 1797, Britain purchased this land \\"‚Ä¶from the Huron Indians for about 300 pounds' worth of supplies‚Ä¶\\". In 1858, Sandwich was properly acknowledged with \\"town\\" status.Neal, Frederick. Township of Sandwich: Past and Present. (Windsor, Ontario: The Essex County Historical Association and The Windsor Public Library Board, 1979). In 1935, Old Sandwich Town was amalgamated with East Windsor, Windsor, and Walkerville to formulate the city of Windsor, Ontario. Sandwich has been the site of significant historic events, such as the beginning of the War of 1812 between Britain and the US, in part fought over the northern border with Canada. This brought various influential military figures to Old Sandwich Town, such as; Chief Tecumseh, British Major Generals Sir Isaac Brock and Henry Procter, and American General William Henry Harrison, who later became the ninth president of the United States. Sandwich also saw action during the Upper Canada Rebellion in 1837-1838; which revealed Sandwich and Windsor to be likely targets for rebellion, and invasion by a Fenian movement from the United States. The Battle of Windsor commenced during December 1838, which confirmed suspicions of American invasion. Hundreds of \\"Patriots\\" stormed the Canadian frontier of the Detroit River, until they were thwarted by militia in Sandwich. Historic buildings, monuments and notable residents Augustus Adams in his front yard, Sandwich, Ontario, 1906 Old Sandwich Town is home to some of Ontario's oldest and most historically important buildings, such as Mackenzie Hall, built by Alexander Mackenzie, a local stone-mason and builder who went on to be Canada's second Prime Minister,City of Windsor ‚Äì Mackenzie Hall and the Duff Baby House, considered to be the oldest-surviving structure in all of Ontario. Some important Canadian figures have lived here, including Mackenzie and Henry Bibb, a fugitive slave who founded the first Afro-Canadian newspaper. In the antebellum years of the United States, Sandwich and the surrounding area became a destination and established black settlement for thousands of freed and fugitive slaves taking refuge from slavery in the United States. A life-size bronze statue of a dismounted Brock alongside a mounted Tecumseh, created by Canadian sculptor Mark Williams, was unveiled in Sandwich Towne, on September 7, 2018. The sculpture commemorates the partnership between the two leaders which resulted in the capture of Detroit. Scott Finlay was the model for Brock while David Morris was the model for Tecumseh; both frequently portrayed the two leaders during War of 1812 commemorative events in Ontario. Brock is shown examining Detroit through his telescope while Tecumseh watches a British artillery battery on the Canadian shore bombard the fort. The community has published a self-guided tour so that visitors can explore the history and heritage of the former town of Sandwich.

To understand the model, it helps to consider how associative learning is usually studied. For example, to study the learning of an association between cues, such as lights and sounds, and an outcome such as food, an experimenter typically pairs the cues and the food a number of times (the learning phase) and then tests with one or more of the cues to see if a response has been learned (the test phase). Most theories of associative learning have assumed that phenomena of interest (see Classical conditioning for a list of phenomena) depend on what happens during the learning phase. The comparator hypothesis assumes, on the contrary, that what happens during the learning phase is fairly simple, and that most interesting phenomena depend on what happens during the test phase. The comparator hypothesis arose primarily in response to so-called ‚Äúcue competition‚Äù effects. If for example in classical conditioning, two conditioned stimuli A and B are presented with an unconditioned stimulus, one may find on test that the subject responds to A or to B or to both or not very much to either. How can one account for such varied results? First proposed by Ralph Miller' the comparator hypothesis is a model of Pavlovian associations which posits that cue competition effects arise at the time of test, that is during performance, not during learning. The model assumes, essentially, that during conditioning the subject acquires both CS-US and context-US associations. At the time of the test, the associations are compared, and a response to a CS occurs only if the CS-US association is stronger than the context-US association. The model was initially proposed to account for unexplained variations in cue competition effects such as recovery from blocking, but has been expanded to apply more broadly to learning phenomena.

Students in the main section of the Lyc√©e are drawn from the residential areas of the southern suburbs of Aix-en-Provence.  Location  The Lyc√©e is located on a sunny hillside in a village called Luynes, on the southern outskirts of Aix- en-Provence. The surroundings are picturesque Proven√ßal villages and residential areas dominated by Montagne Sainte-Victoire, a major landmark of the Aix area, and a favorite motif of Paul C√©zanne. The school has the pleasure to be located in the countryside but within convenient distance of all major facilities. The site for the school buildings was chosen to take full advantage of the benefits of the area both in terms of the quality of life and of its unique position between Aix-en-Provence and Marseille.  History  The school is named after Georges Duby, an influential twentieth- century historian who taught at the University of Aix-en-Provence.  Specializations  The Lyc√©e provides three years of French secondary education to students ages 15 to 18. The first-year students are typically 15 or 16 and are called Secondes, the equivalent of the American term Sophomores. During this year the students take the same general courses. The second-year students are 16 to 17 and are called Premieres, or Juniors. After the first year, students are expected to choose a s√©rie, an academic specialization similar to a ‚Äúmajor‚Äù at an American university. During this year the students take courses tailored to their choice of one of the three following general s√©ries: -scientifique (S), a strong emphasis on mathematics and sciences like physics and chemistry. -√©conomique et social (ES), focused on economics and the social sciences. -litt√©raire (L), or the humanities, including languages (French and foreign languages), history, geography, and literature. They can also choose a technical s√©rie, including sciences et technologies de la gestion (STG) ‚Äì Management Sciences and Technologies. The third-year students are 17 or 18 and are called Terminales, or Seniors. They continue the classes required for their specialization. At the end of the final year of schooling, most students sit for a final standardized qualification, the baccalaur√©at (diploma). The three year secondary education can lead to immediate employment, further studies at a university, or a further diploma from the lyc√©e. If a student desires to pursue professional, post‚Äìbaccalaur√©at studies at the lyc√©e, he or she can apply for a two-year course entitled the Brevet de technicien supp√©rieur (BTS). It is a professional education in international trade and business, training students through a combination of coursework, internships in companies, and other training periods. Students who complete the program are prepared to be professional international businesspeople.  International Sections  The lyc√©e has two international sections, the English Section and the French-German Section. = The English Section = The English Section plays an important role in the lyc√©e. There are upwards of 350 students in the section of whom one third are English speaking (Anglophones). Students in the section follow mainstream courses in common with the students in the rest of the lyc√©e, but they spend 10 hours per week in specific classes designed to cater for the international objectives of the students and to fulfil the aims of the school. Students in this section can take the OIB, L'option internationale du baccalaur√©at, for an international addition to their diploma. There are normally 5 OIB classes per Grade which are consisted of normally 20-25 students. The head of the section is Sharon Miron-Hughes, with an association named AGESSIA that helps students with extra curricular activities like clubs and also with future educational opportunities. = The French-German Section = This section is designed to deliver both the general French education and an additional German element simultaneously. The Franco- German curriculum begins in the Seconde year and lasts three years. At the end of the Terminale year, students take both the French Baccalaur√©at and the German Abitur qualifications.

Its purpose was to better co- ordinate their armies' operations on the Western Front in the face of a dramatic advance by the German Army which threatened a breakthrough at that moment of their lines during the War's final year. Background On 21 March 1918 the Army Groups of the German Empire launched a massive offensive against the British on the Western Front with the strategic aim of defeating the Allies in the West and winning World War 1, before the United States of America, which had recently entered the conflict on the Allies' side, could mass enough troops in France to intervene in the conflict. The German Spring Offensive (Kaiserschlacht or Kaiser's Battle), started with Operation Michael.Spencer Tucker, Priscilla Mary Roberts, and John S. D. Eisenhower, World War I: A Student Encyclopedia (ABC-CLIO, 2005), 587 The commencement of the German offensive was an astonishing success, with the British Fifth Army being initially routed from its trench systems to the point that there appeared to exist the danger as it fell back en masse of it being overwhelmed, risking a breakthrough the French and British lines on the Western Front by the Germans. The strategic situation was made more unsure for the Allies by a lack of co-ordination between the Commander-in-Chief of the French Armies on the Western Front, General Philippe P√©tain, and his peer British Commander, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, with Petain having hitherto refused Haig's requests for support for the threatened British 5th Army fearing that the attack upon it was a diversionary tactic for an - as yet - undisclosed attack by the Germans upon the French Army. It became clear in the crisis that better co-ordination between the Allies was needed to prevent a German breakthrough. For this reason, British War Cabinet Minister Lord Milner travelled to France, he met with Georges Clemenceau on the 25th, and he urged the appointment of General Foch to unite the front.Amery, Leo, \\"My Political Life, Vol II\\", London: Hutchinson, 1953, pg. 147 In the afternoon, the Paris group traveled to Compiegne to make the change official. However, the English generals were meeting at Abbeville (75 miles away), and the two sides could not connect. The Allies decided to meet at Dury town hall on the morning of the 26th, but this was changed to Doullens because Field Marshal Haig had already planned a meeting with his subordinate Army Commanders there. There was a concern that the advancing Germans might actually overrun the town of Doullens before the conference was convened, so close to the front and so precipitous being the German assault, but this didn't happen and it was held there despite being in the path of the oncoming German advance.Rod Paschall, Colonel Rod Paschall, and John S. D. Eisenhower, The Defeat of Imperial Germany 1917-1918 (Da Capo Press, 1994), 144  Doullens Conference The Stained Glass at Doullens Town Hall, commemorating the Doullens Conference The meeting was held at the Hotel de Ville,'Doullens on parade for Foch centenary', World War 1 'Centenary News' website (1919). https://www.centenarynews.com/article/doullens-on-parade-for- foch-centenary its French attendees were General Petain, French President Raymond Poincar√©, Premier Georges Clemenceau, General Ferdinand Foch, and General Maxime Weygand. Lord Milner, Field Marshal Haig, and Generals Henry Wilson, Herbert Lawrence, and Archibald Montgomery were the British representatives.Spencer Tucker, Priscilla Mary Roberts, and John S. D. Eisenhower, World War I: A Student Encyclopedia (ABC-CLIO, 2005), 588 The conference was successful in forming a more unified command. It agreed the creation of an Allied Commander-in-Chief with the power to co-ordinate Allied operations collectively. The members attending the conference believed that General Ferdinand Foch was the most qualified figure for the nature of the role, and placed him in executive charge of co-ordinating the operations of the Allied Armies on the Western Front. One of Foch's remarks at the conference, to give confidence to the British military figures present (who had grave doubts about the willingness of the French to go on with the war) about his qualifications for role was: \\"I would fight without a break. I would fight in front of Amiens. I would fight in Amiens. I would fight behind Amiens. I would fight all the time. I would never surrender\\".Samuel Lyman Atwood Marshall, World War I (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2001), 357 The text of the Doullens Agreement can be found in the UK National Archives,National Archives, CAB 23-5, pg. 396 of 475 and in The Times (of London) newspaper.The Times, May 22, 1928, pg. 16 A copy of the agreement, written by Prime Minister Clemenceau, can be found here. Lord Milner's notes on the meeting can be found in Prime Minister Clemenceau's autobiography.Clemenceau, Georges, \\"Grandeur and Misery of Victory\\", New York: Harcourt Brace, 1930, pgs. 407-423 =Controversy= Controversy exists about the Doullens Conference because of various people's claims, but primarily Douglas Haig's, that they deserve credit for uniting the Western Front. Upon Lord Milner's return from France on the evening of March 26th, he was given official thanks by his peers on the war cabinet.National Archives, CAB 23-5, pg. 397 of 475 However, he never received public acknowledgment. General Haig says he asked for his two superiors, Lord Milner and General Henry Wilson (CIGS), to come to France and appoint a fighting general like Foch to lead at the Front. Prime Minister Lloyd George says he also asked Milner to go to France. However, no proof can be found of General Haig's claim, although the Prime Minister's claim can be verified. Also, in his war memoirs, Lloyd George published evidence that says General Haig put forward a retreat order to the Channel Ports on March 25th, just a day after his supposed request for Foch.Lloyd George, David, \\"War Memoirs of David Lloyd George, Vol. V, 1917-1918\\", Boston: Little Brown, 1936, pgs. 387 & 388 The retreat order is verified by General Maxine Weygand, General Foch's chief of staff.Weygand, Maxime, \\"Memoires, Vol I\\", France: Flammarion, 1953, pgs. 276-280 Prime Minister Clemenceau mentioned it to Lord Milner the moment Milner arrived at the Doullens Conference, and Milner said he would look into it. Haig told his boss that he was misunderstood, that the order was simply a request for the French to cover his right flank. However, the order is very clear, even mentioning the Channel Ports of Dunkirk, Boulogne, and Calais. Orders given to the B.E.F. commander from 1914 gave him the authority to fall back to the Channel Ports if the situation looked hopeless, but not to evacuate.Cooper, Duff, \\"Haig, The Second Volume\\", London: Faber and Faber, 1936, pgs. 451-454 Presumably, a decision to return to England must be made at a higher level. Fortunately, the Doullens decision that appointed General Foch commander on the Western Front nullified any idea of a Dunkirk evacuation in 1918. Other, smaller controversies exist with regards to claims made by Lloyd George and General Henry Wilson, and a rumour from French Minister of Munitions Loucher that two Doullens Agreements were written during the conference. =A Secret= The Doullens Conference Room, noting seating positions at the table The suspect desk, where the Doullens Agreement was written The Doullens Agreement It appears as though the Doullens participants left behind a secret that they all agreed not to discuss. It is commonly understood that the agreement was written by Prime Minister Clemenceau, the civilian leader over the French Army. However, a comparison of handwriting between Georges Clemenceau and Ferdinand Foch shows that Foch was its author. From a legal point of view, an officer cannot write his own promotion order; it must be written by his superior. The situation that early afternoon at Doullens town hall is explained by author Gabriel Terrail: \\"Lord Milner asked Prime Minister Clemenceau into the corner of the room and said, 'The British generals accept command of General Foch'. Clemenceau answered, 'Is this a proposal from the government?', to which Lord Milner replied, 'The British government, I guarantee, will ratify what we have decided. Do we agree?' The Prime Minister said, 'We agree...We just need to find a formula that leads to susceptibilities. I‚Äôm going to see Foch...Wait for me‚Ä¶'. Clemenceau adds, 'I called Foch, I made him aware of the proposal and I asked him to find the formula necessary to avoid crumpling at Haig and Petain.' Foch, after half a minute or so of reflection, said to me: 'Here is what one could write: By decision of the Governments of Great Britain and France, General Foch is responsible for coordinating, on the Western Front, the operations of the French and British armies whose commanders-in-chief Marshal Haig and General Petain, will have to give him all the information useful for the establishment of this coordination'. I approved of this formula, Foch scribbled it down‚Ä¶‚Äù Terrail, Gabriel, \\"The Unique Command\\" Paris: Literary & Artistic Co., 1920, pgs. 212 & 213 (translated from french) Due to the high status and public renown of General's Haig and Petain, Prime Minister Clemenceau was sensitive to their reaction of General Foch's promotion. Also, Foch knew how to write the order. Even so, the next day: ‚ÄúOn 27th, a commission invited to define the powers given to our chief of staff (Foch had kept his old job, which was not very compatible with that of a field general), Under Secretary of State for War Jeanneney said, ‚ÄúFoch is above Petain and Douglas Haig to put them in agreement.‚ÄùIbid., pg. 213 This disagreement set into motion the Beauvais Conference.National Archives, CAB 23-6, pg. 8 of 457, minute 2 A final controversy over General Foch's promotion occurred on April 15th. A day earlier, he wrote the following letter to Clemenceau: ‚ÄúThe Beauvais conference on April 3rd gave me sufficient powers to lead the Allied War. They are not known to subordinates, due to indecisions, delays in execution. To remedy this, by my letter of April 5th, I had the honor to ask you to be so kind as to let me know the title I should take in my new duties. I propose that of, ‚ÄúCommander-in-Chief of the Allied Armies‚Äù. As there are no delay in the conduct of operations, please send my request urgently to the English government so that it can respond without delay.‚ÄùMarshall-Cornwall, Sir James, ‚ÄúFoch as Military Commander‚Äù, New York: Crane, Russak, 1972, Appendix II Foch‚Äôs request for a title was immediately approved by both the English and French governments.CAB 23-6, pg. 72 However, in all of recorded history, only one other general wrote his own promotion order and gave himself a title. That general was Napoleon Bonaparte, who on May 18, 1804, declared himself Emperor of France, and the following December, crowned himself in front of the Pope and a large audience. Given the historical differences between England and France, and the possibility that a French General in overall charge of the Western Front, which included five English Armies, might not be received well by the English people, it is possible that those who attended the Doullens Conference conspired not to tell the entire truth about what took place.  Beauvais Conference  A secondary meeting occurred at the French town of Beauvais on 3 April 1918 as a result of the above matter. The end agreement addressed a commander in chief's (General's Haig, Petain, Pershing, Albert (Belgium), and Diaz's (Italy)) right to protest an order that he felt threatened his army. General Tasker Bliss, senior military representative of the United States of America's Supreme War Council was present at this meeting to give the United States' assent to the candidature of Foch for the post.Jehuda Lothar Wallach, Uneasy Coalition: The Entente Experience in World War I (Greenwood Publishing Group, 1993), 114 As mentioned, General Foch's title was addressed on April 14, 1918, after he wrote to Prime Minister Clemenceau.Cornwall-Marshall, Appendix II It was approved by the British War Cabinet the following day.National Archives, CAB 23-6, pg. 72 of 457, minute 12 The text of the Beauvais Agreement can be found in the UK National Archives.Ibid., pg. 18  Abbeville Conference  This was the fourth Supreme War Council meeting (in January 1918, the allies agreed to meet once a month to discuss war strategy). This conference was held on 1-2 May 1918 in the French town of Abbeville, France. Its purpose was to resolve the Allies' reinforcement troop shortages in the 4th year of the war. The French and the British were by this late stage of the conflict struggling to meet the numbers for the maintenance of the war, and requested of the American representatives present an escalation of the U.S.A.'s plans for the shipment its troop formations across the North Atlantic Ocean to assist with making up the shortfall.Spencer Tucker, Laura Matysek Wood, and Justin D. Murphy, The European Powers in the First World War: An Encyclopedia (Taylor & Francis, 1996), 1 At this meeting, the allies agreed to modify \\"The London Agreement\\" signed by Lord Milner and General Pershing just a week earlier, in order to ramp up the shipment of American troops to France. Also at this conference Prime Minister Vittorio Orlando consented to General Foch's (as the new 'Allied Commander-in-Chief') authority extending to the Southern European theatre front in North Italy, to facilitate co-ordination of the Italian Army's operations there with those taking place on the Western Front in France and Belgium.

He is known for being a Confederate brigadier general during the Civil War and his works in the Texas educational system. Early life and career John Moore was born to Margaret Creed and Cleon Moore in 1824. Moore first went to Emory and Henry College and then graduated from West Point seventeenth in his class in 1849. He joined the infantry and was commissioned a second lieutenant. Shortly after graduating Moore fought in the Seminole War. He was then stationed in Santa Fe, New Mexico, from 1852 to 1853, and as first lieutenant at Fort Union from 1853 to 1854. Moore resigned from his commission in 1855. He then became a professor at Shelby College in Kentucky. Civil War Service Shortly after the Civil War began Moore joined the Confederate States Army as a Captain and was sent to Galveston, Texas, where he became commander, to begin working on defensive fortifications.John H. Eicher and David J. Eichers' \\"Civil War High Commands\\" (2001) pg. 870 While in Galveston John Creed Moore was partially responsible for raising and training the 2nd Texas Infantry Regiment and was elected its colonel. In 1862 Moore fought in the Battle of Shiloh where he was commended for his bravery by Brig. Gen. Jones M. Withers. He was then promoted to brigadier general a month later on May 26, 1862, for his services at Shiloh.Ezra J. Warner's \\"Generals in Gray:Lives of the Confederate Commanders\\" (1959) pg. 219 Moore then participated in the Second Battle of Corinth where he forced the Union troops to retreat over a mile away from their original position.Peter Cozzens' \\"The Darkest Days of the War: The Battles of Iuka and Corinth\\" (2006) pg.181 Moore was then sent to reinforce the Confederate troops at Siege of Vicksburg and was then captured at Vicksburg's surrender. After a prisoner exchange Moore was put under the command of General Hardee with whom he fought during part of the Chattanooga Campaign. Disputes between Hardee and Moore led to Moore requesting a transfer from Jefferson Davis.Walter Prescott Webb, H. Bailey Carroll, Eldon Stephen Branda and, Texas State Historical Association's \\"Handbook of Texas\\" (1952) pg. 609-10 The request was denied and John Moore resigned his commission as a brigadier general in the Confederate service in February 1864. Moore then received the rank of lieutenant colonel and was put in command of the Savannah, Georgia Arsenal. Later in 1864 he was reassigned to the Selma arsenal, where he would stay until the end of the war.C. L.

Sinking Damaged off Cove Island in August 1885, the Sweepstakes was then towed to the head of Big Tub Harbour, in the Fathom Five National Marine Park, in Tobermory Ontario, by a tugboat known as Jessie. The schooner suffered serious damage and was not repaired in time, causing it to sink in September 1885. Sweepstakes was transporting coal and the coal was retrieved after the boat sank.Salen, 23. The wreck today The Sweepstakes' bow under water The stern Today, Sweepstakes is said to be picture perfect, where the hull remains intact. Sweepstakes is located approximately 50 yards from the head of Big Tub Harbour and remains in the water at a depth of 20 feet. The bow area of the boat contains the windlass and portions of the starboard railings remain unharmed. The stern name-board has been removed and currently is on display at the Bruce County Museum in Southampton.Folkes, 3. In the middle of the schooner is the center-board box, with the centerboard inside. This extends from keel to deck. The aft-deck of the Sweepstakes has collapsed, causing the stern-post to fall, where it now lies on the bottom of Big Tub Harbour. The Fathom Five National Marine Park has made repairs to the slowly deteriorating schooner to keep the deck from collapsing. Although Sweepstakes deteriorates a little more each year, it is said to be one of the best preserved 19th-century Great Lakes schooners that has been found and is considered one of the most popular shipwrecks in the Fathom Five National Marine Park. Nearby is another popular visited shipwreck, the City of Grand Rapids. The schooner gives a good depiction of what a typical Great Lakes schooner looked like. Contrary to previous advisories when entering the shipwreck, this must be done with caution; entry of the schooner is no longer accessible to divers. The Fathom Five National Marine Park officials have put up fencing to prevent entry into the schooner. This reduces any further damage to the schooner which could be caused by the exhaled bubbles of the divers.Tom Wilson, ‚ÄúOntario Scuba Diving: Sweepstakes‚Äù. Tom Wilson.

It is in the Milky Way, and possibly associated with a neutron star (XMMU J172054.5-372652) formed in the same supernova explosion. The object was formerly mistakenly classified as a distant galaxy.\\"XMM-Newton Discovers Strange-Shaped Supernova Remnant\\", Universe Today, 11 June 2008 G350.1-0.3, a bright radio source in the inner Milky Way, was initially identified by comparing observations from the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope and Parkes Observatory and classified as a supernova remnant in publications from 1973\\"New Galactic Supernova Remnants\\", Nature 246, 28-30, 2 November 1973 and 1975. However, later higher-resolution images in the mid-80s revealed an unexpected irregular morphology that differed substantially from other supernova remnant sources.\\"Detective astronomers unearth hidden celestial gem\\", European Space Agency, 10 June 2008 It was then argued that G350.1-0.3 was a radio galaxy or a galaxy cluster, resulting in a reclassification in which supernova remnant catalogues downgraded the object to \\"supernova remnant candidate\\" or dropped it completely; G350.1-0.3 was subsequently \\"forgotten\\". Research published in 2008 combined archival data and new images from XMM- Newton, the European Space Agency's orbiting x-ray telescope, to demonstrate that G350.1-0.3 is a supernova remnant. The researchers determined that the object's odd shape resulted from exploding next to a dense gas cloud, approximately 15,000 light years from Earth, that prevented even expansion and produced its elongated shape. The researchers also determined that the nearby thermal X-ray source, XMMU J172054.5-372652, is a central compact object of the supernova. G350.1-0.3 is eight light years across and about 900-1000 years old, making one of the youngest and brightest supernova remnants in the Milky Way. It is unlikely that humans would have seen the supernova explosion because intervening interstellar dust would have likely prevented its viewing from Earth.

As the game was planned to be a first part of the series, its full title is Legends of Valour: Volume I ‚Äì The Dawning. The proposed unreleased sequel to Legends of Valour was to take place in the world outside Mitteldorf, the enclosed city where the entirety of Legends of Valour takes place. Plot The protagonist arrives in Mittledorf (which translates to middle village in English from German) to visit their cousin Sven (named Gareth in the early version). Shortly after their arrival, the city is quarantined due to an outbreak of plague and they are barred from leaving. Sven is missing, and throughout the course of the game the protagonist seeks to find him. This is the starting point of the game's main quest, and throughout the protagonist's mission to find Sven the protagonist restores a king to power and slays a demon. Gameplay Legends of Valour is played in a first-person perspective, being one of the first RPGs after it to use a smooth-scrolling three-dimensional environment engine in the style of Wolfenstein 3D. The game also features a point-and-click interface, an either automated or realtime combat, and day/night cycle. The game's mechanics are complex for its time, requiring the player to eat, drink, sleep, pay taxes and take out life insurance. The game takes place in a walled capital city called Mitteldorf, where the player can explore the streets, buildings and a massive network of dungeons and sewers connected through a natural cave system, while completing various missions given by its numerous citizens. Mitteldorf is over a square mile in size and among its many buildings are several taverns, hostels, shops, guilds, temples, prisons as well as other places of interest - well over a hundred locations in total. The player may join guilds, such as the Thieves, Mercenaries, and Men At Arms guilds, or temples for deities, including Asegeir, Loki, Set, Odin, Freya, and Aegir. Joining a guild or temple may prevent membership with others, for example, joining the Thieves Guild prevents the player from joining the temple of Odin, but the player may still join the temples of Asegeir, Set, or Aegir. The guilds and temples offer the player career paths with unique missions and provide a weekly wage. Legends of Valour has two different types of spells: magic spells, and religious spells, the latter may only be obtained by joining a Temple. Characters in Legends of Valour are defined by four attributes: Strength, Intelligence, Speed, and Health. These four statistics are determined by a dice-roll and can be re-rolled as desired during character creation, and the player's race adds bonuses to certain attributes. Strength determines a character's combat prowess, Intelligence determines magical ability and ability to reason, and speed determines a character's movement speed, ability to dodge attacks, and accuracy in combat. The player can choose to play as a human, an elf, or a dwarf; the chosen race influences relations with other characters. Elves gain bonuses to Intelligence and Speed but lower health, dwarves gain bonuses to Health and Strength, but lower speed. Human characters are average in all statistics. The protagonist's gender has no effect on statistics, but affects interactions with NPCs.(1992). Synthetic Dimensions. U.S. Gold. During the game, the player's character can become a vampire or a werewolf. The player character can become drunk, which impairs movement and vision, and be arrested for this. Characters can become undernourished if they neglect their needs (food, water and sleep) and are more likely to catch a disease. Passing guards may overhear illegal conversations. Development Legends of Valour first began development in May 1991, and was developed in two years. U.S. Gold describes Legends of Valour with the catchphrase 'A Virtual World'. Advertisements for Legends of Valour claimed \\"Ultima Underworld, move over! ... Experience the hottest, smoothest 3-D scrolling graphics ever in an underworld, or any world!\\" The One interviewed Kevin Bulmer, one of Legends of Valour's designers, for information regarding its development in a pre-release interview. Bulmer states that the game's city of Mitteldorf is \\"a mile and half [sic] long from North to South and three-quarters of a mile from East to West. According to US Gold's playtesters, the ground plan of the town is eight times the size of Eye of the Beholder 2 and they reckon that to visit every location on the ground level, doing nothing else and playing the game all night and at the weekends, would take you over two weeks.\\" In regards to the design of the game's dungeons, Bulmer explains that \\"we design the puzzles we're putting in the map, rather than draw a map and then fit the puzzles into it.\\" Legends was first developed on PC using texture mapping, but this could not be directly ported to the Amiga version, as \\"on the Amiga each pixel is represented by a number of bits scattered over several bytes. So, wherease [sic] on the PC you can change a pixel in one go by writing to just one byte, on the Amiga you have to write to several bytes, making sure that you don't alter any of the other bits in the process, which takes a lot longer.\\" Bulmer says that \\"We did the Amiga first as a texture-mapped polygon game like the PC but it was so slow because the maths is a nightmare ... So what we're now doing is ray- tracing the player's view, which is a scheme Ian came up with for the PC but we never had time to do.\\" Programmers for the Amiga port, Graham Lilley and Paul Woakes, implemented ray tracing for the Amiga version to help the game run better, \\"and solved any problems there were\\" with it. The One's interviewer notes that ray tracing the 3D scenes is more complicated mathematically, to which Bulmer responds that \\"It is and it should be incredibly slow ... But it isn't. Now we know why it works but we're not telling anybody else! Theoretically the Amiga version should be playing on an 8MHz 286 PC but using this technique we've developed it's more like playing on 16MHz 386. It's given us a huge increase in performance. In fact, we want to take it back over to the PC for the sequel when we get time.\\" The Amiga's ray traced 3D allows functional windows, through which the player can see into or out of a building. Bulmer enthuses about this feature in the Amiga version, stating that \\"You can look diagonally across a building, through a window, into a room, out of the window on the other side and into another street to another building and into a window there.\\" A key feature of Legends' combat are the three ways of striking with a weapon: crushing, jabbing, and swinging with it. Bulmer notes that \\"each weapon has an optimum way of being used and each monster has an optimum way of being attacked.\\" People in Legends are stored as a set of eight 50-pixel high sprites, while monsters and large objects such as trees and streetlights are kept at a 100-pixel scale. The eight sprites correspond to each possible rotation at which a character can be viewed, and sprites are \\"shrunk\\" in real time to correspond to how much of the character is positioned in the player's view. When in dialogue or combat, characters are shown close-up; this sprite is shown in greater detail than when the player is not in dialogue or combat with them. Legends of Valour's dialogue operates in a tree structure, and as the player explores, more conversation topics regarding specific items, areas, and people of interest become available. Legends of Valour is currently being redeveloped for an updated release (Date TBA) by its new owner Charles Hoskinson. Reception The PC version was generally poorly received. Computer Gaming World called the game \\"a stimulating new perspective on fantasy role-playing\\",Computer Gaming World 99, page 48 but strongly criticized its \\"general lack of atmosphere\\" and other \\"numerous deficiencies\\", including the difficulty in saving the game or finding food, drink, and sleep. Despite liking the 3-D VGA graphics, the magazine warned that the \\"grandiose claims\\" SSI made about the game and Spelljammer: Pirates of Realmspace threatened the company's \\"long-standing reputation for quality\\". It received 2 out of 5 stars in Dragon. According to VideoGames & Computer Entertainment, \\"Legends of Valor is an ambitious attempt that couldn't get itself out of the starting gate.\\"VGCE March 1993, page 85 The Amiga version was received much better, and was rated 88% by CU Amiga, with Amiga Format stating in their original review, \\"Legends of Valor is a cross between a Dungeons and Dragons game and a graphic adventure ... the [actual] interface is intuitive and well designed ... there are plenty of nice touches ... if you've met the person before then they'll remember you.\\" In a 1993 issue, Amiga Format rated the game 91%, but in a 1995 issue the re- release was given 86% despite being the same game. Amiga Power continues the same trend, giving the game 88% in a 1993 issue, and the re-release 89% in a 1995 issue. The One gave the Amiga version of Legends of Valour an overall score of 92%, referring to its first-person 3D perspective as \\"revolutionary ... Until you've seen the 3D in action it's hard for words to explain just how exhilarating the experience can be.\\" The One praises the UI, calling it \\"intuitive\\", and the combat and graphics, stating that \\"The excellent use of 3D extends to the combat as well - at last you can see your sword blade or axe head hitting home, and the animation on the enemies is superb ... Visually Legends is nothing short of breathtaking\\". The One extends critical acclaim to the quests and worldbuilding, expressing that \\"As a game Legends is beautifully structured ... as the player grows in experience and power new tasks and different areas of the gameworld are slowly revealed, ensuring that the player is constantly being presented with fresh challenges and surprises ... Legends is nothing short of a revolution in computer role-playing, and has become the standard by which future additions to the RPG genre will be judged.\\" Finnish gaming magazine Pelit gave the Amiga version of Legends of Valour an overall score of 45%, beginning their review by stating that \\"[Legends of Valour] sets the standards that all role-playing games will be compared to - that is, for the worse ... The game has been successfully buried under idiotic design.\\" Pelit criticises Legends of Valour's gameplay, expressing their disdain for the length of time it takes to travel to specific locations, and states that \\"moving along the streets has been hampered by 'ingenious' random arrests ... To stay alive, one has to sleep, drink, and eat, but cannot when it is so IMPOSSIBLE! One of the reasons behind this problem is money, or its lack thereof.\\" Pelit further criticises the implementation of the need to drink, expressing their frustration that drinking alcohol may result in the player being arrested, and states that \\"Apparently one must constantly return to a pond to drink muddy water. It cannot be bottled because the game has no bottles to refill.\\" Pelit further criticises Legends of Valour's gameplay and items, stating that \\"except for weapons, items are useless\\" and \\"The gameplay under all this idiotic design is pathetic. The Commodore PC-10's homemade text adventures offer more variety. Interaction with other people is very limited. No one lives anywhere, they just wander. Houses are empty except for tables. About 90% of the buildings are insignificant and there is nothing usable in the shops. People will attack you if they don't like how you look. Yes, your character is arrested, even though the city is filled with psychopaths.\\" Pelit expresses their frustration for guilds in Legends of Valour, stating that \\"There is no point in joining the guilds because the hero has no abilities to develop! You need to join the guilds only because the design of the game requires it.\\" Pelit's only compliment for Legends of Valour is its graphics, calling movement \\"technically sound\\" and expressing that \\"Externally, it looks good and with the smallest window, it updates quickly, which is a plus.\\" Pelit concludes their review by stating that \\"In [Legends of Valour] EVERYTHING is so perfectly (swear word) that the human brain capacity is not enough to understand it. Maybe we're just stupid.\\" Legacy Bethesda Softworks's Todd Howard cited the game as an influence on Bethesda's RPG series The Elder Scrolls.Ben Hanson, \\"Road To Skyrim:The Todd Howard Interview\\", Game Informer, January 13, 2011 The first game in the series, The Elder Scrolls: Arena, was inspired by \\"the unheralded\\" Legends of Valour and Ultima Underworld. Ted Peterson, a writer and designer for several Elder Scrolls games, said: \\"There was another game that came out while we were working on Arena called Legends of Valour, which was a free-form first-person perspective game that took place in a single city. It got pretty pitiful reviews and not many people bought it, but I really had fun with it. It's completely forgotten nowadays, but I probably logged more hours playing it than any other game.\\" A demo for Legends of Valour is featured on Amiga Format issue #40's coverdisk. Purchase by Charles Hoskinson In 2020, Charles Hoskinson purchased the rights to Legends of Valour, stating that he plans to develop a new game based on the original.

College career Fresh from an Arkansas state championship at Pine Bluff High School, Reed joined the Arkansas men's basketball team in 1977, at the height of the success of the \\"Triplets\\" ‚Äì Sidney Moncrief, Ron Brewer and Marvin Delph ‚Äì and was a key part of the team that made it to the 1978 NCAA Final Four, finishing third after losing to eventual champion Kentucky Wildcats in the semifinal game. A guard, Reed broke into the starting line-up for the Razorbacks in his sophomore year and was a starter for the remainder of his career. In 1979, Reed was instrumental in helping Arkansas to a very successful season following the loss of Brewer and Delph. The team, captained by Moncrief, made it to the NCAA Regional Finals before losing to the Larry Bird-led Indiana State Sycamores. In the game, Reed was called for traveling after he tripped with 1:02 remaining in the game, and the Sycamores held on for the final shot. Sycamore player Bob Heaton took five steps to the bucket and scored on a left- handed shot at the buzzer, giving ISU a 73‚Äì71 win and a trip to the Final Four, where they finished second to Magic Johnson and the Michigan State Spartans.http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/031506/spc_reed.shtml Following that season, Reed played as a member of the gold medal-winning American team at the 1979 World University Games, joining such teammates as Kevin McHale, Jeff Ruland and Andrew Toney.http://usocpressbox.org/usoc/pressbox.nsf/(staticreports)/2005SWUG/$File/Summer+World+University+Games+History.pdf?Open The 1981 NCAA Tournament featured the shot that turned Reed into a star of the NCAA tournament. In the second round of the tournament, the Southwest Conference champion Razorbacks were playing the defending NCAA tournament champion Louisville Cardinals in Austin, Texas. Trailing by one with five seconds remaining in the contest, the Razorbacks threw the ball to Reed after a timeout. He was unable to get the ball to any of his teammates, including future NBA players Darrell Walker and Scott Hastings, and took a desperation shot from just beyond the mid-court line as the clock expired. The ball ripped through the net, giving Arkansas a 74-73 victory (this game was prior to the advent of the 3-point shot in the college game). The team lost their next game against the LSU Tigers.http://www.arsnonline.com/modules.php?op=modload&name;=News&file;=article&sid;=4047 Reed ranks number 21 on the Arkansas all-time scoring list at the start of the 2008‚Äì2009 season with 1,260 points. Only 6 foot 2 inches tall (though he played center in high school), he led the Razorbacks in blocked shots in 1979 with 30. A member of three Southwest Conference championship teams, Reed ended up playing in four NCAA Tournaments during his tenure and was named National Association of Basketball Coaches All-District in 1980 and 1981. Post- collegiate career Reed was selected in the 5th round (104th pick overall) of the 1981 NBA draft by the Kansas City Kings, though he never played in the NBA.

Brooks (1915‚Äì1977) was a Canadian labour union activist, the first president of the United Auto Workers Local 444, who was assassinated by an upset employee of Chrysler Motors. Brooks was born in Windsor, Ontario. Growing up during the Great Depression, he witnessed first-hand the devastation that the Windsor citizens endured at that time, and these experiences brought him into the trade union movement.Mundy, Jim. \\"Les Dickirson receives 2007 Charles E. Brooks Labour Community Service Award\\" , 27 October 2007.  CAW Local 444 Brooks played a key role in the foundation of CAW Local 444, one of the largest locals of the United Auto Workers in Canada. He served as its president for 21 years, from 1956 until his death in 1977, during which time he fought for greater wages and benefits for Chrysler workers.Hayes, J. \\"Our History\\" This helped to improve the quality of life and standard of living in Windsor, which was a city that was economically fuelled by the Chrysler, Ford and General Motors plants located in the city. After his death, Local 444 became part of the Canadian Auto Workers in 1985. Social programs Brooks also focused much of his time as president pushing social programs as funded by the government including health care, education, housing programs and income support plans.\\"A Tribute To Charlie Brooks\\" , 26 January 2007. Brooks was instrumental in introducing drug plans through Green Shield and coverage through S. & A. Windsor Medical and Ontario Hospital Plan\\"The Walkerville-Chrysler Connection\\" The Walkerville Times In addition to these programs, he was also an avid supporter of the United Way charity organization. Brooks led by personal example and helped raise labour participation to a higher level than anywhere else in Canada. Death and legacy In 1977, Brooks was shot dead by a disgruntled Chrysler worker who was disillusioned when Local 444 was unable to get the man's job back after a third discharge.Gindin, Sam.\\"The Canadian Auto Workers: The Birth and Transformation of a Union\\" , 2007. After his death, Brooks' legacy continues to live on in Windsor-Essex County. The Peace Fountain, located in the Detroit River, was erected in honour of him for his efforts toward world peace. The Charles E. Brooks Labour Community Service Award, which is awarded yearly to a citizen for their work in the community, was also created in memory of Brooks.

It lies within Carmarthenshire, Wales. The summit plateau of the mountain reaches a height of 2221 feet above sea level. Picws Du and Fan Foel are the other, higher summits of the Bannau Sir Gaer / Carmarthen Fans.Nuttall, John & Anne (1999). The Mountains of England & Wales - Volume 1: Wales (2nd edition ed.). Milnthorpe, Cumbria: Cicerone. . The glacial lake of Llyn y Fan Fach dominates the panorama to the north of the peak. Beyond the lake to the north lies the Usk Reservoir and then the Cambrian Mountains on the horizon. Swansea Bay and the Bristol Channel are visible to the south across the undulating dip slope of the mountain. The Tywi valley lies to the west, with Llandovery and Llandeilo as important market towns nearest to the hills. Geology Waun Lefrith is formed from the sandstones and mudstones of the Brownstones Formation of the Old Red Sandstone laid down during the Devonian period. Its southern slopes are formed from the hard-wearing sandstones of the overlying Plateau Beds Formation which are of upper/late Devonian age. It is those rocks which form vertical crags along the top edge of the scarp. The northern face of Waun Lefrith was home to a glacier during the ice ages which gouged out the cwm in which Llyn y Fan Fach now sits. This empties via the Afon Sawdde into the River Towy. The southern slopes drain via the Twrch Fechan, the Nant Menyn and Nant Lluestau into the Afon Twrch and so into the River Tawe.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 map sheet 213 'Brecon' & accompanying sheet explanation Large moraines occur to the east of the summit at the base of the scarp, and below the prominent peak of Picws Du as well as those damming the Lake. Access Llyn y Fan Fach lake beyond Picws Du The entire mountain is open country and so freely accessible to walkers. The most popular path of ascent is that from the car park at the foot of the water board road running steeply up to Llyn y Fan Fach and over which lake the mountain looms. It lies to the east of the small village of Llanddeusant. However, the road is in very bad condition for car travel, and poorly signposted. The ridge running up to the peak starts at the dam on the lake (where there is a small refuge hut or bothy) and rises west up the hill before turning along the edge of the cliff above the lake. The walk along the escarpment gives excellent aerial views of the lake, although some care is needed in poor visibility or cold weather. The high level route of the Beacons Way from Llangadog to Abergavenny runs over Waun Lefrith whilst the low level route runs along the foot of its northern escarpment to the small glacial lake of Llyn y Fan Fach. Most of the upper part of the mountain is covered with peat bogs, but the footpath is protected at some points by stone pavements. The path follows the edge of the escarpment, giving panoramic views in all directions. The footpath from Llanddeusant avoids the parallel tarmacked road to the dam, rising along the ridge which leads directly to the summit. As in all mountains care is needed when the weather is poor, when visibility falls due to mist, fog or driving rain and snow. Navigation can become difficult when landmarks disappear, and especially dangerous when walking along the edge of the escarpment. A prismatic compass and local map are essential companions to aid route finding. There are relatively few walkers on the Black Mountain, even when the weather is good and clear, so the walker must rely on his or her own resources to complete a circuit. Wildlife Red kite in flight showing distinctive tail feathers carrion crow in flight There are numerous different species of bird in the area, and they include the red kite, common buzzard, kestrel, carrion crow, common raven and jackdaw as well as the skylark, to name a few of the most obvious residents. The kestrel and buzzard are widely distributed, but the raven is restricted to the higher mountains. The red kite survived in this area and was the last refuge of the species thanks to the lack of shoots for game birds. It has now been reintroduced to many parts of England and Wales thanks to campaigns run by the RSPB and Forestry Commission, for example. There are several game birds such as pheasant and red grouse. There is a wide distribution of mammals such as field voles, foxes and badgers as well as many songbirds. The skylark is plentiful due to the extensive rough pasture present below the main peaks which allows ground nesting of the species. Pied wagtails are common near the streams and torrents running from the hill tops.

It is unclear when the first Bah√° º√≠s entered Slovakia, but there were Bah√° º√≠s in what is now Czechoslovakia by 1910. As the communist period was ending, there is evidence of activity in Slovakia starting around 1989. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in late 1991, Bah√° º√≠ communities and their administrative bodies started to develop across the region formerly under the influence of the Soviet Union, including Czechoslovakia. In 1991 Slovakia's first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in Bratislava, which is also home to the Forel International School. Separate national assemblies for the Czech and Slovak Republics were formed in 1998. While registration with the national government of Slovakia is not required it is required for many religious activities as well as owning property. In 2007 representatives of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith submitted 28,000 signatures of supportive citizens to the government of Slovakia, gaining official recognition as a registered religious community. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 680 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005.  Early days  =  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s Tablets of the Divine Plan = Before 1918, the region of Slovakia was part of the empire of Austria‚ÄìHungary.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, then head of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917 suggesting Bah√° º√≠s take the religion to many lands, including these. These letters were compiled in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan, but its publication was delayed owing to World War I and the Spanish flu pandemic. They were translated and published in Star of the West magazine on 12 December 1919. One tablet says in part: > \\"In brief, this world‚Äìconsuming war has set such a conflagration to the > hearts that no word can describe it.

However in the Soviet sphere during the period of the Warsaw Pact the civil government adopted the Soviet policy of oppression of religion, so the Bah√° º√≠s, strictly adhering to their principle of obedience to legal government, abandoned its administration and properties. There was a group of Bah√° º√≠s in Prague for a period of time. As the period of communist dominance in Eastern Europe was ending, there is evidence of organized activity in Slovakia dating from around 1989. Significant expansion and consolidation of Bah√° º√≠ communities was occurring by the time of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in late 1991, with Bah√° º√≠ administrative bodies elected throughout areas that had been cut off behind the Iron Curtain, including Czechoslovakia. 1991 saw the election of the first Bah√° º√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly, in Bratislava, and later in the same year of the National Spiritual Assembly of Czechoslovakia and the Local Assembly of Ko≈°ice. Separate national assemblies for the Czech and Slovak Republics were formed in 1998. Modern community There are established Bah√° º√≠ communities in and around Bansk√° Bystrica, Bratislava, Ko≈°ice, Trenƒç√≠n, and Trnava. Since the inception of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, its founder Bah√° ºu'll√°h exhorted believers to involvement in Socioeconomic development, leading individuals to become active in various projects. Although there has been no long‚Äìterm project organized by the Bah√° º√≠ Community of Slovakia, individuals from Slovakia have undertaken projects both here (in the form of non-governmental organizations and non-denominational private schools) and abroad (see for example mention of Earth Day 1995, when Slovakia joined the list of countries with soil deposited in the Peace Monument of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro). Prominent figures from Slovakia who are not themselves Bah√° º√≠s have shown interest in Bah√° º√≠ projects and issues internationally, most recently on 13 December 2004 when the First Lady of the Slovak Republic, Silvia Ga≈°paroviƒçov√°, attended a prayer service at New Delhi's Lotus Temple, the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship. In many years, the Slovak government has supported United Nations resolutions condemning the persecution of Bah√° º√≠s in Iran. =Registration= Registration of religious groups is not required under Slovak law, only registered religious groups have the legal right to own property, build places of worship, officiate at marriages, and conduct public worship services and other activities. Those that register are eligible for financial support from the government, including subsidies for clergy and administrative expenses. The Bah√° º√≠s of Slovakia were among a short list of recognized communities refusing to accept such financial support, as Bah√° º√≠ law prohibits financial contribution from outside the Bah√° º√≠ community. In early 2007, representatives of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith submitted to the government of Slovakia 28,000 signatures from citizens in support of their registration. This met the contemporary requirement for recognition as a registered religious community, which was soon granted by the Slovak government. At the time, there is mention of there being 200 members of the Slovak Bah√° º√≠ community. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 680 Bah√° º√≠s in 2005. Shortly thereafter, the law was changed to require 20000 individuals to actually be members of the religion before it could be registered.

He was a very close companion of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. He served as the Deputy Speaker in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly from 1981 till 1982 and the Minister of Law and Justice, Waqf for the Government of Rajasthan from 1983 till 1985. Private life Ahmad Bakhsh Sindhi was born to Haji Mola Bakhsh Sindhi and his wife, Saira Hajjan in Bikaner, Rajasthan. Sindhi was primarily raised and educated by his mother because his father died when he was 8 years old due to choking on a bone. In 1944, Sindhi achieved the gold medal in his Master of Arts and Bachelor of Laws studies at the prestigious Aligarh Muslim University in the city of Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh, India. From 1944 till 1947, he was a lecturer in philosophy at the Dungar College in Bikaner. He was remarkably proficient in English, Urdu and Hindi languages. On 6 June 1945, Ahmad Bakhsh Sindhi married Ameena Begum of Bikaner. The couple had five daughters, and one son. Political career Sindhi‚Äôs first political achievement was being appointed to the position of Cabinet Minister for the independent state of Bikaner by its Maharaja, Sir Sadul Singh, in 1948. Post independence, Sindhi contested in the first two Legislative Assembly elections from Bikaner seat under the banner of Indian National Congress. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru demonstrated personal interest in his election campaigns and visited Bikaner. From 1949 till 1980, Sindhi practiced law in the Rajasthan High Court. He was known for feeding the poor there as well as his overall social work for the lower class in the area. One notable instance was his campaign to help people get housing instead of living on the street by the Sardarpura Cemetery. During a 1971 debate regarding the Indo-Soviet Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation, Sindhi is cited to have tried to add the amendment to the treaty. \\"...If any country invades us [India], we shall depend solely on our own defensive resources and will try to obtain as much aid from other friendly countries as possible\\" In 1980, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly (or Vidhan Sabha), representing the city of Jodhpur, India. Soon after, Sindhi was elected as the Deputy Speaker of the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly to serve till 14 October 1982. It was in 1983 when he reached the pinnacle of his political career, when he became Law and Justice Minister in Shiv Charan Mathur‚Äôs ministry by Indira Gandhi. He retained this position until March 1985. Life after politics Sindhi spent the next few years of his life alternating between life in India and in the US to visit his children and grandchildren. By 1994, he eventually settled down in the US, living with his wife and their son. Sindhi had a cardiac arrest in 2000, and was taken to William Beaumont Hospital in Detroit.

He is renowned for his accomplishments in teaching many famous professional golfers as well as amateurs. He tutored Virginia Van Wie for many years, including during her stretch of three consecutive U.S. Women's Amateurs from 1932‚Äì34. He also worked with Glenna Collett Vare, Lawson Little, Betty Hicks, Phil Farley, George Schniter, Horton Smith and other top players of the era. Early life Jones was born near Manchester, England. He began playing golf as a young boy and won the caddie championship at age 12. By the age of 18 secured employment at Chislehurst Golf Club as an assistant professional. In 1913 at the age of 25 he was made head professional at that club. In 1914 he joined the army. As a soldier in the First World War, he was in France. There in March 1916 he was serving in the Sportsman's Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers, near Loos. As the result of an exploding grenade, he suffered the loss of his right leg just below the knee. While a severe injury on its own merit, Jones was afraid it would be a handicap and perhaps be the end to his career as a professional golfer. He was sent back to England where he recuperated for four months. Able to walk using crutches, he proceeded to attempt his first round of golf at Royal Norwich in 1916 where he carded an 83 (38/45) on that first outing. He followed shortly thereafter with a 72 on a long and challenging course. While a relief regarding his prospects for continuing the golf profession, these rounds would prove to bring a surprising and revolutionary change to his concept of golf and its instruction. Later, he was fitted with a prosthetic. In 1923, at the invitation of Marion Hollins, Jones accepted the position of Head Golf Professional at the Women's National Golf and Tennis Club in Long Island, New York. Along with his wife Rosina and daughter Rosina, they located in Oyster Bay, New York. The residence was a short eight miles to the golf course. This was the beginning of a lifelong career of teaching in the U.S. Subsequent to this position, Jones began teaching in New York city. He had an indoor teaching facility on the 7th floor of the A.G. Spaulding and Bros. store at 518 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. During this time he would book almost 3,000 lessons per year at the exorbitant price of $5 teaching from 9:30 in the morning until he need to leave to catch the 6:08 train for Glen Head, Long Island. Other notable instructors of the era would not have half that number of lessons and would charge many times that amount. Jones found that he could achieve better success with his students indoors because they would not be distracted by ball flight and instead focused on performing the swing correctly by focusing on swinging the club with the intention of creating centrifugal force in the club that could in turn propel the ball. Perhaps his favorite training aid and that for which he became known was a swinging a penknife suspended from two handkerchiefs knotted end to end. Instructional development Jones began to ask himself how it could be that he could yet score so effectively, with such a radical change needing to be made to how his body swung the club having only one leg. Jones himself as well as countless others proved to be able to play well with missing body parts or body parts that were limited in their function. Despite the prevalence of golf instruction that described these missing or malfunctioning parts as being essential, Jones and others demonstrated that a golfer's brain would devise compensating strategies to yet produce fine golf shots. This success, in conjunction with his reading of Sir Walter Simpson's book, \\"The Art of Golf\\", brought him to the fundamental fact that the key to a successful golf shot was not the correct movement of certain body parts, but the correct movement of the club. Instead of the movement of body parts, the real key was the successful movement of the golf club. Jones had happened upon the then-little- understood fact that the human brain need only experience a person's desire to perform a task. On its own the brain devises a means to create the muscular action to achieve the task. The individual is only aware of \\"what\\" they want to do. The brain's action in deciding \\"how\\" it will accomplish the task is completely unconscious. This explains how very proficient golfers often report that they have little understanding of \\"how\\" they swing and only understand that they can do so when they choose. Thus it was the case that Jones began his now-famous quest to discover, document, and disseminate a description of \\"how\\" the club swung and how to most easily teach the club's movements to others. The result was the writing of many articles on this subject and the publishing of two books. Further, Jones took every opportunity to share his insights with fellow professionals. Jones' simple concept is summarized in the classic \\"Swing The Clubhead\\" instruction. The drastic simplicity of his approach to golf instruction met with rancor and objection when he was invited by the PGA (Professional Golfers' Association of America) to present his work. Horton Smith, then the incoming president of the association, told Jones his system was \\"..too simple. We wouldn't sell enough lessons.\\" Jones responded, \\"That's the trouble, you want your students to keep on suffering. Once you get your people to swing the clubhead they will improve.\\" Perhaps much to the PGA's chagrin, whereas an average pro would have given about 600 lessons a year, Jones would give many times that number. One of Jones' devotees was Angel de la Torre who in turn taught this approach to his son Manuel de la Torre. These two professionals alone would add thousands to the list golfers who benefited from a \\"club-focused\\" approach to golf. Jones often said, \\"The trouble with the teaching of golf, is that one is taught what a swing produces [body movement], instead of how to produce a swing [club movement].\\" Manuel de la Torre was the preeminent authority on the Ernest Jones approach and further developed it in his teaching. Death and legacy Jones died in 1965. His career included playing competitively on the European tour, winning a number of tournaments, head golf professional at several of America's most esteemed golf clubs, and a career of teaching both tour professional and amateur golfers. In 1965 he was the recipient of the Ben Hogan award. Along with Harvey Penick, Tommy Armour, and Percy Boomer, he was inducted into the World Golf Teachers Hall of Fame in 1977 .

He earned his medical degree in 1925 at Charles University in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Early in his career he studied anatomy and held research and faculty positions at the universities in Zurich, Switzerland and Freiburg, Germany. In 1938, he emigrated to the United States where he became a citizen. At the outbreak of World War II, Bors joined the Army Medical Corps.The American Paraplegia Society 1954-2004: Our legacy, our future. J Spinal Cord Med. 2004;27(4):287-303. Bors became interested in spinal cord injury while caring for veterans after the war. In 1944, he joined the staff of Hammond General Army Hospital in Modesto, California. As assistant chief of urology, Bors was urology consultant to the hospital's Spinal Cord Injury Care Section.Donovan WH. Spinal cord injury‚Äîpast, present and future. J Spinal Cord Med. 2007;30(2):85-100 At that time, comprehensive care for the injured veterans was hindered by a lack of a cohesive approach to their complex medical and social problems. Bors was appalled by the lack of specific interventions for bladder management and other conditions secondary to spinal cord injury. He was motivated to devote his career to improving every aspect of the care of individuals with spinal cord injury. As a result of his experiences, Bors became the foremost expert on neurourology in traumatic spinal cord injury. He also developed a holistic multidisciplinary approach that formed the foundation for modern spinal cord injury care centers. His successful organization of a comprehensive specialized ward attracted the attention of the War Department. Modeled on Bors' innovative approach, in 1945, the War Department opened the first Spinal Cord Injury Center in the United States at Birmingham General Army Hospital in Van Nuys, California, with Bors in charge. Soon, he had 220 patients under his care. Military doctors from around the country visited his facility and began to establish similar centers around the country. In 1958, Bors helped oversee the construction of a new facility dedicated to the SCI Service, which is now known as Long Beach VA Medical Center. For the next two decades, doctors and administrators from around the world observed the innovative work of Bors and his colleague, Dr. Estin Comarr. By 1970, the year he retired, Bors had overseen the care of more than 2,500 people with SCI. Through his efforts, the number of SCI centers increased in the US, as well as the staff-to-patient ratio. Bors authored more than 140 scientific papers and a major textbook, co-authored by Estin Comarr and titled, Neurological Urology, Physiology of Micturition, its Neurological Disorders and Sequelae, which remains the authoritative text in this field.Bors EHJ, Comarr AE.

The highest peak is Fan Foel immediately next along the ridge and it is a subsidiary summit of Fan Brycheiniog.Nuttall, John & Anne (1999). The Mountains of England & Wales - Volume 1: Wales (2nd edition ed.). Milnthorpe, Cumbria: Cicerone. . Picws Du falls within Fforest Fawr Geopark and its prominent summit is marked by a large Bronze Age round barrow at a height of 2457 feet above sea level. Waun Lefrith is the other, lower summit of the Bannau Sir Gaer / Carmarthen Fans situated to the west.Ordnance Survey Explorer map OL12 'Brecon Beacons National Park: western area' The peak overlooks the glacial lake of Llyn y Fan Fach in the cwm below. As the peak sits on the edge of the escarpment on a ridge which juts out into the valley below, the views from the summit are panoramic and extensive. The views to the north are especially impressive when the weather is clear, looking towards the Cambrian Mountains, Mynydd Epynt and Brecon. Swansea and the Bristol Channel can just be seen on the horizon to the south, across the gently falling dip slope. Pen y Fan and Corn Du are distinctive landmarks seen directly to the east across Fforest Fawr. Llyn y Fan Fach lake below Picws Du Geology Picws Du is formed from the sandstones and mudstones of the Brownstones Formation of the Old Red Sandstone laid down during the Devonian period. Its summit and southern slopes are formed from the hard-wearing sandstones of the overlying Plateau Beds Formation which are of upper/late Devonian age. The northwestern and northeast faces of Picws Du were home to small glaciers during the ice ages which gouged out the cirque of Pwll yr Henllyn and Pant y Bwlch. These cwms drain via the Afon Sawdde into the River Towy to the west. They also drain into the River Usk to the north, which then drains into the Usk Reservoir, visible from the summit of the mountain in the middle distance. The southern slopes drain into the Afon Twrch and the slopes to the east so into the River Tawe. The glacial lake of Llyn y Fan Fach is situated below the summit to the west, and is only slightly smaller than its companion Llyn y Fan Fawr about 2 miles to the east.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 map sheet 213 'Brecon' & accompanying sheet explanation There are several large linear moraines below the cliffs, similar to that below Fan Hir, and some of which retain small pools. Archaeology The summit hosts a very large Bronze Age round barrow which is in a degraded state and remains unexcavated. However, there are similar burial cairns at the summits of Pen y Fan and Fan Foel. The latter was excavated in 2002-4 with the results published in 2014 in Archaeologia Cambrensis. The round barrow was about 16 meters (about 52 feet) wide and was badly eroded with stones from the structure removed to build a central cairn by passing walkers. Excavation of the barrow showed that it contained two separate burials, the central one in a stone cist contained the burnt bones of an adult woman and two children carbon dated to about 2000 BC. It is likely that the barrow on Picws Du is of a similar age when the climate was much warmer than today, and the now deserted sub-arctic and tree-less landscape supported a larger human population than at present. There are several legends associated with the glacial lake below the summit, Llyn y Fan Fach, one of which is the story of the Lady of the Lake. Access The Black Mountain range seen from the Usk Reservoir with Picws Du at right The entire mountain is open country and so freely accessible to walkers. The most popular approach includes a circuit of the neighbouring peaks of Waun Lefrith and Fan Foel. The high level route of the Beacons Way from Llangadog to Abergavenny runs over Picws Du whilst the low level route runs up to Llyn y Fan Fach and beside the Afon Sychlwch at the foot of its northern escarpment. The higher route follows the edge of the escarpment from near Fan Hir, where the path climbs the escarpment from Llyn y Fan Fawr. Stone pavements have been added at especially wet parts of the path, where the path crosses peat bogs. There is a well built stone staircase climbing the escarpment where the Beacons Way rises from Llyn y Fan Fawr to Fan Brycheiniog. Access to the mountain is also possible from the car park at the foot of the road leading the small dam on Llyn y Fan Fach. The road gives an easy but steep route to the lake, and Picws Du looms large over the scene. The footpath rises from the dam wall up the ridge to the east until it reaches the cliff above the lake. It then follows the cliff edge across Waun Lefrith to the summit, passing several rock outcrops and gullies dropping to the lake below. The views are extensive to the south with Swansea visible as well as the Bristol Channel. Views to the north include Mynydd Epynt and Brecon, with Llandeilo and the Tywi valley to the west. As in all mountains care is needed when the weather is poor, especially when visibility falls due to mist, fog or driving rain and snow. Navigation can become difficult when landmarks disappear, and is particularly dangerous when walking along the edge of the escarpment. A prismatic compass and local map are essential companions to aid navigation. There are relatively few walkers on the Black Mountain, even when the weather is good and clear, so the rambler must rely on his or her own resources to complete a circuit. Wildlife Common Buzzard in flight, Devon, England. There are around 40,000 breeding pairs in the United Kingdom Red kite in flight showing distinctive tail feathers There are numerous different species of bird in the area, and they include the red kite, common buzzard, kestrel, carrion crow, common raven and skylark to name a few of the most obvious residents. The red kite was previously restricted to this and adjoining areas in South Wales such as Mynydd Mallaen, owing to persecution from farmers and gamekeepers who thought (wrongly) that the bird attacked game birds. The red kite has since been re-introduced widely in many parts of Britain, such as the Chilterns and Northamptonshire. The kestrel and buzzard are widely distributed, but the raven is mainly restricted to the higher mountains. There is a wide distribution of mammals such as field voles, rabbits, foxes, weasels and badgers as well as many songbirds. The skylark is plentiful due to the extensive rough pasture present below the main peaks which allows ground nesting of the species. Pied wagtails are common near the streams and torrents running from the hill tops. The mountain tops are above the tree line, and sessile oak is found clinging to the lower valley sides where they are sheltered from the winds. There are also a number of conifer forests maintained by the Forestry Commission on the lower slopes.

As workers moved away from farm work to factories, mines and other hard labor, they faced harsh working conditions such as long hours, low pay and health risks. Children and women worked in factories and generally received lower pay than men. The government did little to limit these conditions. Labor movements in the industrialized world developed that lobbied for better rights and safer conditions. Shaped by wars, depressions, government policies, judicial rulings, and global competition, the early years of the battleground between unions and management were adversarial and often identified with aggressive hostility. Contemporary opposition to trade unions known as union busting started in the 1940s and continues to present challenges to the labor movement. Union busting is a term used by labor organizations and trade unions to describe the activities that may be undertaken by employers, their proxies, workers and in certain instances states and governments usually triggered by events such as picketing, card check, worker organizing, and strike actions.https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5604656 Labor legislation has changed the nature of union busting, as well as the organizing tactics that labor organizations commonly use.  Strike breaking and union busting, 1870s‚Äì1935  Hiring agencies specialising in anti-union practices has been an option available to employers from the bloody strikes of the last quarter of the nineteenth century, until today.From Blackjacks To Briefcases  A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page xiv. Working with owner John D. Rockefeller, Charles Pratt's Astral Oil Works in 1874 began to buy refineries in Brooklyn to decrease competition. Around this time, the coopers' union opposed Pratt's efforts to cut back on certain manual operations, as they were the craftsmen who made the barrels that held the oil. Pratt busted the union, and his strategies for breaking up the organization were adopted by other refineries. Creative methods of union busting have been around for a long time. In 1907, Morris Friedman reported that a Pinkerton agent who had infiltrated the Western Federation of Miners managed to gain control of a strike relief fund, and attempted to exhaust that union's treasury by awarding lavish benefits to strikers.The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, William D. Haywood, 1929, pages 157-58. However, many attacks against unions have used force of one sort or another, including police action, military force, or recruiting goon squads. =Physical attacks against unions= Unions such as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) were devastated by the Palmer Raids, carried out as part of the First Red Scare. The Everett Massacre (also known as Bloody Sunday) was an armed confrontation between local authorities and IWW members which took place in Everett, Washington on Sunday, November 5, 1916. Later, communist-led unions were isolated or destroyed and their activists purged with the assistance of other union organizations during the Second Red Scare. Artist's depiction of the Haymarket Square riot In May 1886 the Knights of Labor were demonstrating in the Haymarket Square in Chicago, demanding an eight-hour day in all trades. When police arrived, an unknown person threw a bomb into the crowd, killing one person and injuring several others. \\"In a trial marked by prejudice and hysteria\\" a court sentenced seven anarchists, six of them German-speaking, to death - with no evidence linking them to the bomb.Tindall and Shi, 1984, p. 829. Strikes also took place that same month (May 1886) in other cities, including in Milwaukee, where seven people died when Wisconsin Governor Jeremiah M. Rusk ordered state-militia troops to fire upon thousands of striking workers who had marched to the Milwaukee Iron Works Rolling Mill in Bay View, on Milwaukee's south side. In 1914 one of the most bitter labor conflicts in American history took place at a mining colony in Colorado called Ludlow. After workers went on strike in September 1913 with grievances ranging from requests for an eight-hour day to allegations of subjugation, Colorado governor Elias Ammons called in the National Guard in October 1913. That winter, Guardsmen made 172 arrests.Kick et al., 2002, p. 263. The strikers began to fight back, killing four mine guards and firing into a separate camp where strikebreakers lived. When the body of a strikebreaker was found nearby, the National Guard's General Chase ordered the tent colony destroyed in retaliation. \\"On Monday morning, April 20, two dynamite bombs were exploded, in the hills above Ludlow [...] a signal for operations to begin. At 9 am a machine gun began firing into the tents [where strikers were living], and then others joined.\\" One eyewitness reported: \\"The soldiers and mine guards tried to kill everybody; anything they saw move\\". That night the National Guard rode down from the hills surrounding Ludlow and set fire to the tents. Twenty-six people, including two women and eleven children, were killed. Kick et al., 2002, p. 264. =Union busting with police and military force= For approximately 150 years, union organizing efforts and strikes have been periodically opposed by police, security forces, National Guard units, special police forces such as the Coal and Iron Police, and/or use of the United States Army. Significant incidents have included the Haymarket Riot and the Ludlow massacre. The Homestead struggle of 1892, the Pullman walkout of 1894, and the Colorado Labor Wars of 1903 are examples of unions destroyed or significantly damaged by the deployment of military force. In all three examples, a strike became the triggering event. *Pinkertons and militia at Homestead, 1892 - One of the first union busting agencies was the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, which came to public attention as the result of a shooting war that broke out between strikers and three hundred Pinkerton agents during the Homestead Strike of 1892. When the Pinkerton agents were withdrawn, state militia forces were deployed. The militia repulsed attacks on the steel plant, and prevented violence against strikebreakers crossing picket lines, causing a decisive defeat of the strike, and ended the power of the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers at the Homestead plant. *Federal troops end the railroad blockades by the American Railway Union, 1894 - During the Pullman Strike, the American Railway Union (ARU), out of union solidarity, called out its members according to the principle of industrial unionism. Their actions in blocking the movement of railroad trains were illegal but successful, until twenty thousand federal troops were called out to ensure that trains carrying US mail could travel freely. Once the trains ran, the strike ended. *National Guard in the Colorado Labor Wars, 1903 - The Colorado National Guard, an employers' organization called the Citizens' Alliance, and the Mine Owners' Association teamed together to eject the Western Federation of Miners from mining camps throughout Colorado during the Colorado Labor Wars. =Anatomy of a corporate union buster= Corporations Auxiliary Company, a union buster during the first half of the 20th century, would tell employers, > Our man will come to your factory and get acquainted... If he finds little > disposition to organize, he will not encourage organization, but will > engineer things so as to keep organization out. If, however, there seems a > disposition to organize he will become the leading spirit and pick out just > the right men to join. Once the union is in the field its members can keep > it from growing if they know how, and our man knows how. Meetings can be set > far apart. A contract can at once be entered into with the employer, > covering a long period, and made very easy in its terms. However, these > tactics may not be good, and the union spirit may be so strong that a big > organization cannot be prevented. In this case our man turns extremely > radical. He asks for unreasonable things and keeps the union embroiled in > trouble. If a strike comes, he will be the loudest man in the bunch, and > will counsel violence and get somebody in trouble. The result will be that > the union will be broken up.Harry Wellington Laidler, Boycotts and the labor > struggle economic and legal aspects, John Lane company, 1913, pages 291-292 In the period 1933 to 1936, Corporations Auxiliary Company had 499 corporate clients.John J. Abt, Michael Myerson, Advocate and activist: memoirs of an American communist lawyer, University of Illinois Press, 1993, page 63 =College students as strikebreakers in the Interborough Rapid Transit strike of 1905= Following a walk out of subway workers, management of the trains Interborough Rapid Transit in New York City appealed to university students to volunteer as motormen, conductors, ticket sellers and ticket choppers. Stephen Norword discusses the phenomenon of students as strikebreakers in early 20th Century North America: \\"Throughout the period between 1901 and 1923, college students represented a major, and often critically important source of strikebreakers in a wide range of industries and services. (...) Collegians deliberately volunteered their services as strikebreakers and were the group least likely to be swayed by the pleas of strikers and their sympathizers that they were doing something wrong.\\" =Jack Whitehead, the first \\"King of Strike Breakers\\"= There were a significant number of strikes during the 1890s and very early 1900s. Strikebreaking by recruiting massive numbers of replacement workers became a significant activity. Jack Whitehead saw opportunity in labor struggles; while other workers were attempting to organize unions, he walked away from his union to organize an army of strikebreakers. Whitehead was the first to be called \\"King of the Strike Breakers\\"; by deploying his private workforce during strikes of steelworkers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Birmingham, Alabama, he became wealthy. By demonstrating how lucrative strikebreaking could be, Whitehead inspired a host of imitators.From Blackjacks To Briefcases  A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 40. =James Farley inherits the strikebreaker title= After Whitehead, men like James A. Farley and Pearl Bergoff turned union busting into a substantial industry. Farley began his strikebreaking career in 1895, and opened a detective agency in New York City in 1902. In addition to detective work, Farley accepted industrial assignments, specializing in breaking strikes of streetcar drivers.From Blackjacks To Briefcases  A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 41. Farley hired his men based in part upon courage and toughness, and in some strikes they openly carried firearms. They were paid more than the strikers had been. Farley was credited with a string of successful strikebreaking actions, employing hundreds, and sometimes thousands of strikebreakers. Farley was sometimes paid as much as three hundred thousand dollars for breaking a strike, and by 1914 he had taken in more than ten million dollars. Farley claimed that he had defeated thirty-five strikes in a row. But he suffered from tuberculosis, and as he faced death, he declared that he turned down the job of breaking a streetcar strike in Philadelphia because this time, \\"the strikers were in the right.\\"From Blackjacks To Briefcases  A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 41-42, 45, 47-48, and 53-54. =Bergoff Brothers Strike Service and Labor Adjusters= Pearl Bergoff also began his strikebreaking career in New York City, working as a spotter on the Metropolitan Street Railway in Manhattan. His job was to watch conductors, making certain that they recorded all of the fares that they accepted. In 1905 Bergoff started the Vigilant Detective Agency of New York City. Within two years his brothers joined the lucrative business, and the name was changed to the Bergoff Brothers Strike Service and Labor Adjusters. Bergoff's early strikebreaking actions were characterized by extreme violence. A 1907 strike of garbage cart drivers resulted in numerous confrontations between strikers and the strikebreakers, even when protected by police escorts. Strikers sometimes pelted the strikebreakers with rocks, bottles, and bricks launched from tenement rooftops.From Blackjacks To Briefcases  A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 55-56. AFL as a fly on the wheel, 1913 In 1909, the Pressed Steel Car Company at McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania fired forty men, and eight thousand employees walked out under the banner of the Industrial Workers of the World. Bergoff's agency hired strikebreaking toughs from the Bowery, and shipped vessels filled with unsuspecting immigrant workers directly into the strike zone. Other immigrant strikebreakers were delivered in boxcars, and were not fed during a two-day period. Later they worked, ate, and slept in a barn with two thousand other men. Their meals consisted of cabbage and bread.From Blackjacks To Briefcases  A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 58-59. There were violent confrontations between strikers and strikebreakers, but also between strikebreakers and guards when the terrified workers demanded the right to leave. An Austro-Hungarian immigrant who managed to escape told his government that workers were being held against their will, resulting in an international incident. In addition to kidnapping, strikebreakers complained of deception, broken promises about wages, and tainted food.From Blackjacks To Briefcases  A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 59-60. During federal hearings, Bergoff explained that \\"musclemen\\" under his employ would \\"get... any graft that goes on\\", suggesting that was to be expected \\"on every big job.\\" Other testimony indicated that Bergoff's \\"right-hand man\\", described as \\"huge in stature, weighing perhaps 240 pounds\\", surrounded himself with thirty-five guards who intimidated and fleeced the strikebreakers, locking them into a boxcar prison with no sanitation facilities when they defied orders.From Blackjacks To Briefcases  A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 61. At the end of August a gun battle erupted, leaving six dead, six dying, and fifty wounded. Public sympathy began to swing away from the company, and toward the strikers. Early in September the company acknowledged defeat and negotiated with the strikers. Twenty-two had died in the strike. But Bergoff's business wasn't hurt by the defeat; he boasted of having as many as ten thousand strikebreakers on his payroll. He was getting paid as much as two million dollars per strikebreaking job.From Blackjacks To Briefcases  A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 67. =Anti-union vigilantes during the First Red Scare= Unlike the American Federation of Labor, the Industrial Workers of the World opposed the First World War. The American Protective League (APL) was a pro-war organization formed by wealthy Chicago businessmen. At the height of its power the APL had 250,000 members in 600 cities. In 1918, documents from the APL showed that ten percent of its efforts (the largest of any category) were focused on disrupting the activities of the IWW. The APL burgled and vandalized IWW offices, and harassed IWW members. Such actions were illegal, yet were supported by the Wilson administration.Information from American Protective League Retrieved March 28, 2007. =Spies, \\"missionaries,\\" and saboteurs= AFL as a cannon aimed at a government building, 1914 Strikebreaking by hiring massive numbers of tough opportunists began to lose favor in the 1920s; there were fewer strikes, resulting in fewer opportunities.From Blackjacks To Briefcases  A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 68. By the 1930s, agencies began to rely more upon the use of informants and labor spies. Spy agencies hired to bust unions developed a level of sophistication that could devastate targets. \\"Missionaries\\" were undercover operatives trained to use whispering campaigns or unfounded rumors to create dissension on the picket lines and in union halls. The strikers themselves were not the only targets. For example, female missionaries might systematically visit the strikers' wives in the home, relating a sob story of how a strike had destroyed their own families. Missionary campaigns have been known to destroy not only strikes, but unions themselves.From Blackjacks To Briefcases  A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 88-89. In the 1930s, the Pinkerton Agency employed twelve hundred labor spies, and nearly one-third of them held high level positions in the targeted unions. The International Association of Machinists was damaged when Sam Brady, a veteran Pinkerton operative, held a high enough position in that union that he was able to precipitate a premature strike. All but five officers in a United Auto Workers local in Lansing, Michigan were driven out by Pinkerton agents. The five who remained were Pinkertons. At the Underwood Elliott-Fisher Company plant, the union local was so badly injured by undercover operatives that membership dropped from more than twenty five hundred to fewer than seventy-five.From Blackjacks To Briefcases  A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 88. =General strikebreaking methods= During the period from roughly 1910 to 1914, Robert Hoxie compiled a list of methods used by employers' associations to attack unions. The list was published in 1921, as part of the book Trade Unionism in the United States. These methods include counter organization, inducing union leaders to support management, supporting other pro-business enterprises, refusing to work with pro-union enterprises, obtaining information on unions among others.Robert Franklin Hoxie, Lucy Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade Unionism in the United States, D. Appleton and Co., 1921, pages 195-200. Hoxie summarized the underlying theories, assumptions, and attitudes of employers' associations of the period. According to Hoxie, these included the supposition that employers' interests are always identical to society's interests, such that unions should be condemned when they interfere; that the employers' interests are always harmonious with the workers' interests, and unions therefore try to mislead workers; that workers should be grateful to employers, and are therefore ungrateful and immoral when they join unions; that the business is solely the employer's to manage; that unions are operated by non-employees, and they are therefore necessarily outsiders; that unions restrict the right of employees to work when, where, and how they wish; and that the law, the courts, and the police represent absolute and impartial rights and justice, and therefore unions are to be condemned when they violate the law or oppose the police.Robert Franklin Hoxie, Lucy Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade Unionism in the United States, D. Appleton and Co., 1921, pages 195-96. Given the proliferation of employers' associations created primarily for the purpose of opposing unions, Hoxie poses counter-questions. For example, if every employer has a right to manage his own business without interference from outside workers, then why hasn't a group of workers at a particular company the right to manage their own affairs without interference from outside employers?Robert Franklin Hoxie, Lucy Bennett Hoxie, Nathan Fine, Trade Unionism in the United States, D. Appleton and Co., 1921, page 198. Strikebreaking and union busting, 1936‚Äì1947 Employers in the United States have had the legal right to permanently replace economic strikers since the Supreme Court's 1937 decision in NLRB v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co.\\"The Union Avoidance Industry in the United States\\", British Journal of Industrial Relations, John Logan, Blackwell Publishing Ltd, December 2006, pages 651‚Äì675. Meanwhile, employers began to demand more subtle and sophisticated union busting tactics, and so the field called \\"preventive labor relations\\" was born.Confessions of a Union Buster, Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, page 33. The new practitioners were armed with degrees in industrial psychology, management, and labor law. They would use these skills not only to manipulate the provisions of national labor law, but also the emotions of workers seeking to unionize.From Blackjacks To Briefcases  A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 97. =Nathan Shefferman (Labor Relations Associates), 1940s‚Äì1950s= After passage of the Wagner Act in 1935, the first nationally known union busting agency was Labor Relations Associates of Chicago, Inc. (LRA) founded in 1939 by Nathan Shefferman, who later in 1961 wrote The Man in the Middle, a guide to union busting, and has been considered the 'founding father' of the modern union avoidance industry. Shefferman had been a member of the original NLRB, and became director of employee relations at Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck and Company. Sears had been engaged in blocking unions from the AFL Retail Clerks union throughout the 1930s. Sears provided $10,000 seed money to launch LRA.Confessions of a Union Buster, Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, page 33-34. In 1957 during hearings conducted by the United States, Congress, and Select Committees on Improper Activities in the Labor and Management Field.https://archive.org/details/investigationofi16unit Nate Shefferman was questioned by Robert Kennedy and testimony revealed that Teamsters union \\"top brass\\" were regularly sent to meet with him. An article written by Victor Riesel for Inside Labor on May 28, 1957 reveals that Dave Beck, President of the Teamster's Union in that era, worked closely with Nate Shefferman on many deals not the least of which may have been his influence at Sears to discourage employees from joining the AFL Retail Clerks union which was trying to raid the Teamsters membership to join them instead. An indicator of the close relationship between the Teamster's President David Beck and Shefferman (excerpted from the article): \\"Beck dispatched Shefferman to Jim Hoffa last year (1956) to offer Hoffa the union's presidency if Hoffa would first help re-elect Beck and then wait 6 months for Beck to resign on grounds of ill health\\". The article asks \\"Why did Beck and the multi-million dollar Shefferman work so closely‚Äîand on what?\\" By the late 1940s, LRA had nearly 400 clients. Shefferman's operatives set up anti-union employee groups called \\"Vote No\\" committees, developed ruses to identify pro-union workers, and helped arrange sweetheart contracts with unions that would not challenge management.From Blackjacks To Briefcases  A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 98-99. Consultants from LRA \\"committed numerous illegal actions, including bribery, coercion of employees and racketeering.\\" Shefferman built \\"a daunting business on a foundation of false premises\\", of which \\"perhaps the most incredibleand most widely believedis the myth that companies are at a disadvantage to unions organizationally, legally, and financially during a union-organizing drive.\\" What businesses sought to accomplish through such propaganda was for Congress to amend the Wagner Act.Confessions of a Union Buster, Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, page 35. One of Shefferman's associates defined his technique simply by saying: \\"We operate the exact way a union does,\\" he said. \\"But on management's side. We give out leaflets, talk to employees, and organize a propaganda campaign.\\"Center for Labor Education & Research, University of Hawaii - West Oahu: Honolulu Record Digitization Project Honolulu Record, Volume 10 No. 35, Thursday, March 27, 1958 p. 2, Strikebreaking and union busting, 1948-1959 In 1956, Nathan Shefferman defeated a unionizing effort of the Retail Clerks Union at seven Boston-area stores by employing tactics that Walter Tudor, the Sears vice-president for personnel, described as \\"inexcusable, unnecessary and disgraceful.\\" At a Marion, Ohio, Whirlpool plant, an LRA operative created a card file system which tracked employees' feelings about unions. Many of those he regarded as pro-union were fired. A similar practice took place at the Morton Frozen Foods plant in Webster City, Iowa. An employee recruited by LRA operatives wrote down a list of employees thought to favor a union. Management fired those workers. The list-making employee received a substantial pay increase. When the United Packinghouse Workers of America union was defeated, Shefferman arranged a sweetheart contract with a union that Morton Frozen Foods controlled, with no participation from the workers. From 1949 through 1956, LRA earned nearly $2.5 million providing such anti-union services.From Blackjacks To Briefcases  A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, pages 98-100. In 1957, the United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management (also known as the McClellan Committee) investigated unions for corruption, and employers and agencies for union busting activities. Labor Relations Associates was found to have committed violations of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, including manipulating union elections through bribery and coercion, threatening to revoke workers' benefits if they organized, installing union officers who were sympathetic to management, rewarding employees who worked against the union, and spying on and harassing workers.Confessions of a Union Buster, Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, pages 37-38. The McClellan Committee believed that \\"the National Labor Relations Board [was] impotent to deal with Shefferman's type of activity.\\"From Blackjacks To Briefcases  A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 102. Post-1960s Illegal union firing increased during the Reagan administration and has continued since.Why America Needs Unions, BusinessWeek There is little evidence that employers availed themselves of anti-union services during the 1960s or the early 1970s.From Blackjacks To Briefcases  A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page xvii. However, under a new reading of the Landrum-Griffin Act, the Department of Labor took action against consulting agencies related to filing of required reports in only three cases after 1966, and between 1968 and 1974 it filed no actions at all. By the late 1970s, consulting agencies had stopped filing reports. The 1970s and 1980s were an altogether more hostile political and economic climate for organized labor. Meanwhile, a new multi-billion dollar union buster industry, using industrial psychologists, lawyers, and strike management experts, proved skilled at sidestepping requirements of both the National Labor Relations Act and Landrum-Griffin in the war against labor unions.CNN, 2 Sept. 2017, \\"The Corporate War against Unions\\" citing Logan, John, \\"The Union Avoidance Industry in the United States\\", British Journal of Industrial Relations, Vol. 44, No. 4, pp. 651-675, December 2006 In the 1970s the number of consultants, and the scope and sophistication of their activities, increased substantially. As the numbers of consultants increased, the numbers of unions suffering NLRB setbacks also increased. Labor's percentage of election wins slipped from 57 percent to 46 percent. The number of union decertification elections tripled, with a 73 percent loss rate for unions. The political environment has included the National Labor Relations Board and the U.S. Department of Labor failing to enforce the law against companies that repeatedly violate labor law.CNN, 2 Sept. 2017, \\"The Corporate War against Unions\\" Labor relations consulting firms began providing seminars on union avoidance strategies in the 1970s.From Blackjacks To Briefcases  A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 105. Agencies moved from subverting unions to screening out union sympathizers during hiring, indoctrinating workforces, and propagandizing against unions.From Blackjacks To Briefcases  A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 108-114. By the mid-1980s, Congress had investigated, but failed to regulate, abuses by labor relations consulting firms. Meanwhile, while some anti-union employers continued to rely upon the tactics of persuasion and manipulation, other besieged firms launched blatantly aggressive anti-union campaigns. At the dawn of the 21st Century, methods of union busting have recalled similar tactics from the dawn of the 20th Century.From Blackjacks To Briefcases  A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, Robert Michael Smith, 2003, page 119.

From 1970 to 2003, union density in the US declined from 23.5 percent to 12.4 percent, while in Canada the loss was much smaller, going from 31.6 percent in 1970 to 28.4 percent in 2003.Jelle Visser, Union membership statistics in 24 countries, Monthly Labor Review, Jan. 2006, p.38-49. One difference is that Canadian law allows for card certification and first-contract arbitrations (both features of the proposed Employee Free Choice Act promoted by labor unions in the United States). Canadian law also bans permanent striker replacements, and imposes strong limits on employer propaganda.\\" [36] (Winner- Take-All Politics, Hacker and Pierson,p.60) According to David Bacon, \\"Modern unionbusting\\" employs company-dominated organizations in the workplace to forestall organizing drives.Unions. The New Face of Unionbusting by David Bacon  History of labor legislation  =Railway Labor Act, 1926= The Railway Labor Act[Railway Labor Act]http://railwaylaboract.com/ of 1926 was the first major piece of labor legislation passed by Congress. The RLA was amended in 1936 to expand from railroads and cover the emerging airline industry. At UPS, the mechanics, dispatchers, and pilots are the labor groups that are covered by the RLA. It was enacted because Railroad management wanted to keep the trains moving by putting an end to \\"wildcat\\" strikes. Railroad workers wanted to make sure they had an opportunity to organize, be recognized as the exclusive bargaining agent in dealing with a company, negotiate new agreements and enforce existing ones. Under the RLA, agreements do not have expiration dates; instead they have amendable dates which are indicated within the agreement. =Wagner Act, 1935= The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA),[National Labor Relations Act of 1935]http://www.nlrb.gov/about_us/overview/national_labor_relations_act.aspx often referred to as the Wagner Act, was passed by Congress July 5, 1935. It established the right to organize unions. The Wagner Act was the most important labor law in American history and earned the nickname \\"labor's bill of rights.\\" It forbade employers from engaging in five types of labor practices: interfering with or restraining employees exercising their right to organize and bargain collectively; attempting to dominate or influence a labor union; refusing to bargain collectively and in \\"good faith\\" with unions representing their employees; and, finally, encouraging or discouraging union membership through any special conditions of employment or through discrimination against union or non-union members in hiring. Before the law, employers had liberty to spy upon, question, punish, blacklist, and fire union members. In the 1930s workers began to organize in large numbers. A great wave of work stoppages in 1933 and 1934 included citywide general strikes and factory occupations by workers. Hostile skirmishes erupted between workers bent on organizing unions, and the police and hired security squads backing the interests of factory owners who opposed unions. Some historians maintain that Congress enacted the NLRA primarily to help stave off even more serious ‚Äî potentially revolutionary ‚Äî labor unrest. Arriving at a time when organized labor had nearly lost faith in Roosevelt, the Wagner Act required employers to acknowledge labor unions that were favored by a majority of their work forces. The Act established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), with oversight over union elections and unfair labor practices by employers.[US History Online] http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1612.html =Taft-Hartley Act, 1947= The Taft-Hartley Act(Full Text of Taft Hartley Act of 1947) was a major revision of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (the Wagner Act) and represented the first major revision of a New Deal act passed by a post- war Congress. In the mid-term elections of 1946, the Republican Party gained majorities in both houses for the first time since 1931. With the Truman administration initially taking no stand on the bill, it passed both houses with strong bipartisan support. In addition to overwhelming Republican support, a clear majority of House Democrats voted for the bill, while Democrats in the Senate split evenly, 21-21.‚ÄúTruman-Taft stands ‚Äì point by point‚Äù, CQ Almanac, 1951. The Taft-Hartley Act was vehemently denounced by union officials, who dubbed it a \\"slave labor\\" bill. Truman vetoed the bill with a strong message to Congress, but despite Truman's all-out effort to stop the veto override, On June 23, 1947, Congress overrode his veto with considerable Democratic support, including 106 out of 177 Democrats in the House, and 20 out of 42 Democrats in the Senate. However, twenty-eight Democratic members of Congress declared it a \\"new guarantee of industrial slavery.\\" Taft-Hartley Act gave the National Labor Relations Board the power to act against unions engaged in unfair labor practices; previously, the board could only consider unfair practices by employers. It defined specific employer rights which broadened an employer's options during union organizing drives. It banned the closed shop, in which union membership is a precondition of employment at an organized workplace. It allowed state \\"right to work\\" laws which prohibit mandatory union dues. The act required union officials to swear that they were not communists. This provision was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1965. The act gave the president the power to petition the courts to end a strike if it constitutes a national emergency. Presidents have invoked the Taft-Hartley Act thirty-five times to halt work stoppages in labor disputes; almost all of the instances took place in the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, under presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson, after which the provision fell into disuse. The last two times the emergency provision was invoked were in 1978 by Jimmy Carter and 2002 by George W. Bush. =Landrum- Griffin Act, 1959= The Landrum Griffin Act of 1959 is also known as the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA)(Dept. of Labor text of Landrum Griffin Act) http://www.dol.gov/compliance/laws/comp-lmrda.htm defined financial reporting requirements for both unions and management organizations. Pursuant to LMRDA Section 203(b) employers are required to disclose the costs of any persuader activity as it regards consultants and potential bargaining unit employees.(Dept. of Labor Instructions for LM-20 Agreement and Activities Report)http://www.dol.gov/esa/olms/regs/compliance/GPEA_Forms/lm-20_Instructions.pdf Martin J. Levitt's interpretation is as follows: > The law regulates labor unions' internal affairs and union officials' > relationships with employers. But the law also required companies to report > certain expenditures related to their anti-union activities. Fortunately for > union busters, loopholes in the requirements allow management and their > agents to ignore the provisions aimed at reforming their > behavior.Confessions of a Union Buster, Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, page 41. > The loopholes require consultants to file if they communicate with employees > either for the purpose of persuading them not to join a union, or to gain > knowledge about the employees or the union that may be passed on to the > employer. However, most consultants accomplish these goals by indirect > means, using supervisors and management as their first line of contact with > employees. Even before the Act was passed, labor consultants had identified > front-line supervisors as the most effective lobbyists for > management.Confessions of a Union Buster, Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, page 42. Landrum-Griffin also seeks to prevent consultants from spying on employees or the union. Information isn't to be compiled unless it is for the purpose of a specific legal proceeding. According to Martin Levitt, \\"It is easy for consultants to use this provision as a cover for \\"all kinds of information gathering.\\" According to Martin J. Levitt, \\"because of Landrum-Griffin's vague language, attorneys are able to directly interfere in the union-organizing process without any reporting requirements. Therefore, \\"young lawyers run bold anti-union wars and dance all over Landrum-Griffin.\\" The provisions of Landrum-Griffin allowing special rights for lawyers resulted in labor consultants working under the shield of labor attorneys, allowing them to easily evade the intent of the law.\\"Confessions of a Union Buster, Martin Jay Levitt, 1993, pages 42-43.

It is an independent organization with its own by-laws, policies, board, staff, and budget. The organization is funded by private donors as well as local, state, and national foundations. The Grand Traverse Regional Land Conservancy has a volunteer Board of Directors and a professional year-round, full-time professional staff.  GTRLC‚Äôs mission  To protect northern Michigan‚Äôs significant natural, scenic, and farmlands ‚Äì now and for all future generations.  Foundation  In 1991, Rotary Charities of Traverse City determined that protecting natural resources was critical to the region's quality of life and created a four-county steering committee designed to establish a local land trust. As a result, the Grand Traverse Regional Land Conservancy was born. Since then, the organization has worked to protect the important and significant landscapes that make Michigan‚Äôs Antrim, Benzie, Grand Traverse, Kalkaska, and Manistee counties unique.  About the Grand Traverse Regional Land Conservancy  The GTRLC focuses land conservation efforts to permanently protect crucial wildlife habitat and corridors; critical watersheds, which protect the water quality of northern Michigan; unique high-quality farm lands; valuable forestland; and ecologically significant dunes along Lake Michigan's beautiful and endangered shore. We protect land in several ways: * By working with landowners to permanently protect private land through voluntary conservation easements * By acquiring high quality natural lands; some of these lands are the \\"best of the best\\" and become nature preserves which are open to the public * By assisting local units of government with land transfers that result in enhanced public access to nature and improved recreational opportunities * By providing technical assistance to local units of government with the administration of farmland protection programs  GTRLC‚Äôs legacy to date  As of early 2020, the Conservancy had protected roughly 44,000 acres of natural, scenic, and farm lands and over 130 miles of shoreline along the region's exceptional rivers, lakes, and streams through land acquisition, conservation easements, and land transfers. The Grand Traverse Regional Land Conservancy has assisted more than a dozen units of government in creating or expanding public natural areas and parks. Since 1991, the organization has helped secure over $67 million from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources Trust Fund on behalf of community-led land conservation efforts across its service region.  State and national partners  The Grand Traverse Regional Land Conservancy is one of many independent land trusts across the U.S. GTRLC‚Äôs work is part of a broader network of conservation. GTRLC is a member of the Heart of the Lakes Center for Land Conservation, which acts as a legislative liaison in the State of Michigan and coordinates and promotes sound land preservation policies. GTRLC is also a member of the Land Trust Alliance, a Washington D.C.-based organization which performs a similar role with the U.S. Congress and appropriate departments of the Federal Government.

The International Herald Tribune. 12 February 2009 Investigation In November 2009, Russian authorities declared the end of the criminal investigation. The murder suspects were 29-year-old Nikita Tikhonov and his girlfriend, 24-year-old Yevgenia Khasis, a radical nationalist couple involved with a group called Russky Obraz or Russian Image () and associated with the identitarian organization BORN (Battle Organization of Russian Nationalists) (). Initially, \\"Russkiy Obraz\\" was a magazine, set up by Tikhonov and his friend Ilya Goryachev in 2002 as a clone of the radical fascist Serbian \\"Image\\" () formed by Mladen Obradovic (), Deacon Boban Milovanovic () and Alexander Mishich (). Both were students of history at Moscow State University. According to Tikhonov, the identitarian organization BORN was founded by him and Goryachev in 2007. According to both Khasis and Sergey Smirnov, Russky Obraz was the political roof for BORN similar to Sein Fein's relationship to the Irish Republican Army. According to Khasis, Leonid Simunin was the BORN connection to the Kremlin and the presidential administration through Vladislav Surkov with a siloviki as the retired FSB officer Aleksey Korshunov () another strong supporter of BORN. According to investigators, Tikhonov was the one who committed the murder, while Khasis reported to him, by cell phone, the movements of Markelov and Baburova right before the assault. The motive of the murder was revenge for Markelov's prior work as a lawyer in the interests of Trotskyite activists. The murder suspects were arrested, and were reported to have confessed. In May 2011, Tikhonov was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Khasis was sentenced to 18 years in prison. FSB director Alexander Bortnikov reported to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that the radical group in question committed a murder on ethnic grounds in September 2009 and was preparing another one. In 2015, another member of the BORN nationalis group Ilya Goryachev was sentenced for murder of Markelov.

Some of these parks and roller coasters are still existing today.  Biography  Ingersoll was born in New Jersey, one of five brothers. By 1900, he had moved to Glenfield, Pennsylvania, a community on the Ohio River near Pittsburgh. His 1900 United States census form described his occupation as a \\"coin machine proprietor,\\" but his manufacturing company did more than just sell vending machines: they made them and amusement park rides as well. =Ingersoll Construction= In the 1890s, he designed (and the Ingersoll Construction Company built) roller coasters - mainly the type now known as \\"figure eight\\" coasters like the first one to be installed in Kennywood Park (1902) - and scenic railroads (originally called \\"Russian Mountains\\" as the type originated in Europe).Jim Futrell, Amusement Parks of Pennsylvania (Flagpole Books, 2002) Ingersoll also designed and built another ride that many parks presented as their signature attraction, the Shoot-the- Chutes water ride, a type that has since evolved into the modern log flume that many current parks feature. By 1901, Ingersoll and his company broadened their scope from designing and building amusement park rides to designing and building amusement parks themselves. Two early successes, Riverside Amusement Park in Indianapolis and Rocky Glen Park near Moosic, Pennsylvania, were trolley parks designed, built, and opened by Ingersoll by 1903 and 1905 respectively. With the success of the Ingersoll parks (and that of Coney Island's Luna Park, which opened the same year), Ingersoll conceived of an amusement park chain, featuring establishments both individually and collectively named Luna Park. By 1904, the Luna Park Amusement Company was formed with investor help. =Luna Parks= After the 1905 opening of Indianola Park in Columbus, Ohio, Ingersoll turned his attention to his proposed Luna Park chain. The first two, Cleveland and Pittsburgh - the 36th and 37th parks designed and made by Ingersoll Company - ignited an explosion of park building worldwide, with Luna Parks (both associated with Ingersoll and those having no such connection) being spread around the world. While some Luna Parks (such as Cleveland and Pittsburgh) opening to sizable success, the monetary demands of constantly maintaining and updating rides and other attractions led Ingersoll to declare bankruptcy in 1908. As a result of bankruptcy proceedings, the Cleveland flagship park was sold to one of the investors of the Luna Park Amusement Company, Matthew Bramley, owner of the Cleveland Trinidad Paving Company (at the time the world's largest paving company). Bramley eventually became owner of Luna Park Amusement Company as Ingersoll's monetary problems continued in the 1910s. For a second bankruptcy filing (in 1911), Ingersoll listed liabilities of $179,668 and assets of three suits of clothes, valued at $75. The design and construction of Ingersoll roller coasters, Shoot-the-Chutes, and Luna Parks continued through the 1910s and 1920s despite Ingersoll's never-ending money problems. The oldest Luna Park that is still in operation (Melbourne, Australia) opened in 1912; while the Mexico City Luna Park was short-lived, Luna Loca is currently in operation on the site, while Athens' Ta Aikonada is a descendant of Ingersoll's Luna Park. At its peak, his amusement park empire had 44 sites; his construction company had built 277 roller coaster rides, many of them for parks that competed against his Luna Parks at one time or another, from Charleston, West Virginia to Buenos Aires (the latter later becoming the site of an athletic arena), to Lisbon. \\"Luna Park\\" had entered the vernacular for an amusement park (at one point, Ingersoll had briefly renamed the parks that his company designed, built, and owned as \\"Ingersoll Luna Parks\\" to distinguish them from those to which he had no connection). In Turkey, all amusement parks are called \\"Luna Park\\" regardless of their official names. = Death and eulogy = Ingersoll was found dead at Omaha's Krug Park by an apparent suicide on October 23, 1927. In 1929, former roller coaster designer of Ingersoll Construction, John A. Miller, eulogized him by stating, \\"We owe all the success of the amusement park to Fred Ingersoll.\\"Robert Cartmell, The Incredible Scream Machine (Popular Press 1987) In the same eulogy, Lloyd Jeffries followed up by proclaiming \\"Ingersoll was the tree from which the amusement limbs branched forth, as many of the leading park men of today came from that tree in one way or another.\\"Ingersoll biography (1991 Hall of Fame inductee) - International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions  Ingersoll amusement parks  While Ingersoll's amusement parks were collectively known as Luna Parks, many of his company's creations had other names.

The IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology defines a requirement as: # A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective. # A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed document. # A documented representation of a condition or capability as in 1 or 2. The activities related to working with software requirements can broadly be broken down into elicitation, analysis, specification, and management. Elicitation Elicitation is the gathering and discovery of requirements from stakeholders and other sources. A variety of techniques can be used such as joint application design (JAD) sessions, interviews, document analysis, focus groups, etc. Elicitation is the first step of requirements development. Analysis Analysis is the logical breakdown that proceeds from elicitation. Analysis involves reaching a richer and more precise understanding of each requirement and representing sets of requirements in multiple, complementary ways. Requirements Triage or prioritization of requirements is another activity which often follows analysis. This relates to Agile software development in planning phase, e.g. by Planning poker, however it might not be the same depending on the context and nature of project and requirements or product/service that is getting build. Specification Specification involves representing and storing the collected requirements knowledge in a persistent and well-organized fashion that facilitates effective communication and change management. Use cases, user stories, functional requirements, and visual analysis models are popular choices for requirements specification. Validation Validation involves techniques to confirm that the correct set of requirements has been specified to build a solution that satisfies the project's business objectives. Management Requirements change during projects and there are often many of them. Management of this change becomes paramount to ensuring that the correct software is built for the stakeholders. Tool support for Requirements Engineering =Tools for Requirements Elicitation, Analysis and, Validation= Taking into account that these activities may involve some artifacts such as observation reports (user observation), questionnaires (interviews, surveys and polls), use cases, user stories; activities such as requirement workshops (charrettes), brainstorming, mind mapping, role-playing; and even, prototyping;https://www.liquidplanner.com/blog/7-tools-to-gather-better- software-requirements/ software products providing some or all of these capabilities can be used to help achieve these tasks. There is at least one author who advocates, explicitly, for mind mapping tools such as FreeMind; and, alternatively, for the use of specification by example tools such as Concordion. Additionally, the ideas and statements resulting from these activities may be gathered and organized with wikis and other collaboration tools such as Trello. The features actually implemented and standards compliance vary from product to product. =Tools for Requirements Specification= A Software Requirement Specification document (SRS) might be created using a software tool as general as a word processor or an electronic spreadsheet; but, there are several specialized tools to carry out this activity. Some of these tools can import, edit, export and publish SRS documents. They may or not help the user to follow standards such as IEEE 2918-2011 to compose the requirements according to some structure. Likewise, the tool may or not use some standard to import or export requirements (such as ReqIF); or, not allow these exchanges at all. =Tools for Requirements Document Verification= Tools of this kind verify if there are any errors in a requirements document according to some expected structure or standard. =Tools for Requirements Comparison = Tools of this kind compare two requirement sets according to some expected document structure and standard. =Tools for Requirements Merge and Update= Tools of this kind allow the merging and update of requirement documents. =Tools for Requirements Traceability= Tools of this kind allow to trace requirements to other artifacts such as models and source code (forward traceability) or, to previous ones such as business rules and constraints (backwards traceability). =Tools for Model-Based Software or Systems Requirement Engineering= Model- based systems engineering (MBSE) is the formalised application of modelling to support system requirements, design, analysis, measurement, verification and validation activities beginning in the conceptual design phase and continuing throughout development and later lifecycle phases. It is also possible to take a model-based approach for some stages of the requirements engineering and, a more traditional one, for others. All kinds of combinations might be possible. The level of formality and complexity depends on the underlying methodology involved (for instance, i* is much more formal than SysML and, even more formal than UML) =Tools for general Requirements Engineering= Tools in this category may provide some mix of the capabilities mentioned previously and others such as requirement configuration management and collaboration. The features actually implemented and standards compliance vary from product to product. There are even more capable or general tools that support other stages and activities. They are classified as ALM tools.

Until 2006 it was known as M. Peterson & S√∏n. History It traces its roots to a company founded in 1801 by Danish-born merchant Momme Peterson (1771-1835). Originally a small general store with various groceries and manufactured goods, he later opened a spinning mill. In 1828 the company took the name M. Peterson & S√∏n. Peterson also expanded to trade with timber, and from 1848, the building and owning of ships. In 1875 it bought Moss Jernverk which had had a good location. Having combined timber and shipping, in 1883 the company left the shipping business under the leadership of Theodor Peterson, grandson of the founder. Instead, the company ventured in production of cellulose sulfate with the opening of the factory Moss Cellulosefabrik. From 1898, paper was also produced. Hans Blom Peterson, a descendant of Momme Peterson, served as CEO from 1901 to 1954 and concentrated on developing this part of the company. He also started production of paper sacks. Though Blom Peterson died in 1954 the company remained family owned; in 1963 another descendant Ralph Mollatt took over the leadership. Together with his brother Erik he gradually shunted the company towards the packaging business. In their period, M. Peterson & S√∏n bought several entities within the paper industry, including Sarpsborg Papp (1961), Norsk Papiremballage (1963), Polycoat (1964), Greaker Industrier (1979) and Ranheim Papirfabrikk (1983). Erik Mollatt was CEO from 1983 to 2002. In 2001, the unit Peterson Scanproof (a successor of Greaker Industrier) was split from M. Peterson & S√∏n to form a company of its own, Nordic Paper. M. Peterson & S√∏n still owned Nordic Paper, albeit jointly with Norske Skogindustrier, but sold it in 2006. In the same year, M. Peterson & S√∏n was bought in its entirety by investors, including local businesspeople as well as the forest owners' association AT Skog. At the same time, the name was changed from M. Peterson & S√∏n to just Peterson. Structure In 1989 a new corporate model was introduced, with the ten individual companies grouped under one umbrellaM. Peterson & S√∏n, still family owned. Various transactions between 1998 and 2001, including the selling of Peterson Scanproof and the acquiring of the solid board division of UPM-Kymmene, left a corporate structure with M. Peterson & S√∏n as the parent, and Peterson Packaging and Peterson Linerboard as branches. Peterson Packaging is further subdivided into Peterson Packaging OY and Peterson Emballasje AS, the distinction between the two being that the latter operates in Norway while the former operates abroad. Since the Peterson name was introduced in all sub- companies in 1992, each production unit is named according to its location and field. For instance, the factory formerly known as Sarpsborg Papp is formally named Peterson Emballasje AS, Sarpsborg. In addition to factories in several countries, the company operates numerous sales offices spread around Europe. Logo The original company logo was based on the violet. In 1930 the current elephant theme was introduced. It fell into disuse in the 1970s, but made its return in 1984. The elephant body forms the letters M-O-S-S, in reference to the company's foundation city. The object carried by the elephant is not a tree trunk, but a roll of paper fresh off the mill.

A eusocial insect, individuals have continuous allometric variation in size and morphology to facilitate task allocation and partitioning of work. Workers are 6‚Äì12 mm in length. The larger \\"major workers\\" act as guards for in defence of the colony and protect the smaller \\"minor workers\\" when the latter go foraging outside the nests. The powerful mandibles of the major workers are capable of decapitating smaller arthropods captured as food and dismembering smaller ants of other species. Diet C. vagus is known to be both carnivorous and aphidicolous (living in a mutualistic relationship with aphids and feeding upon the honeydew these smaller insects release from the terminations of their alimentary canals).Ecological Entomology (2006) 31, 41‚Äì51 Range This species is especially prevalent in Central Europe but has an overall range from southern Scandinavia to north-western Africa and from Portugal to Altai, Mongolia.AntWeb Species: Camponotus vagus Evidence of this species in Northern Europe is scattered and isolated; Southwards it is more common. In Norway, an extreme area of its range, is a rare and often overlooked species. There are few records of C. vagus in Sweden and Finland, and many of these are outdated. Habitat The colonies are commonly found in dry habitats, especially open forests and forest edges. C. vagus most typically builds its nests in dead wood, but colonies can also be founder under stones. An average colony has 1,000 to 4,000 workers, but larger colonies contain up to 10,000 individuals. Common names C. vagus, like all ants in genus Camponotus, may be referred to by the English language common name \\"carpenter ant\\" but it is known by other names across its range. In the Netherlands, for example, this species is known in Dutch as zwarte reuzenmier, i.e. \\"black giant ant.\\" Bee paralysis virus In 2008, the Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) was reported for the first time in this species and another species of ant, Formica rufa.

This earned her the nickname \\"Red Angus.\\" =Personal life= Tea at Furlongs 1939, by Eric Ravilious After her visit to Russia in 1932, she became one of the founding members of Artists' International Association, an organisation born out of social and political conflicts of the 1930s. Between 1938 and 1947, Angus was married to James Maude Richards, a young architect and writer, with whom she had a daughter, Victoria, and a son Angus. Later, Richards and Angus divorced. Richards became editor of the Architectural Review and introduced her to many modernist architects.East Sussex Record Office: Report of the County Archivist, April 2006 to March 2007 . August 2007. Retrieved 19 January 2009. She was a charismatic and formidable character, opinionated and inclined to exhibitionism but also generous spirited, extremely sociable and a great inspiration to many young people. Angus had a great love of the outdoor life ‚Äì camping and hiking ‚Äì and was an intrepid traveller with her rucksack on her back. She eschewed a bourgeois lifestyle for places without modern conveniences, such as Furlongs on the Sussex Downs and her croft in the Outer Hebrides. In her childhood, she befriended gypsies in north London encampments and learnt a little Romany. She travelled widely in Europe and across the Middle East to India and Pakistan, looking at patterns and popular culture. Angus spent a year in Indonesia on a scholarship studying Folk Art in Java and Bali. She went twice to the USSR, in 1932 as a delegate for the Art Masters Association, and again in the late 1960s with her friends Ursula Mommens and Pearl Binder and teachers of music, art and drama, arranged through the Society of Cultural Relations with the USSR. =Design work and art= Angus became best known for her industrial designs, tiles and wallpapers. Her significant achievements included a tile mural for the Susan Lawrence School in east London, a 'live exhibit' for the Festival of Britain, a tile mural at the British Pavilion at the 1958 Bruxelles Exhibition, and tile designs for Sir Frederick Gibberd at London Heathrow Airport Underground Station. She also designed a new form of marbling design for glass cladding for the original buildings at Gatwick Airport, which produced by the firm TW Ide was given the trade name 'Anguside'. The massive post-war increase in new public architecture led to a large number of commissions from F.R.S. Yorke of YRM (Yorke Rosenberg and Mardell) for tile designs, particularly for new schools and colleges. Her tile designs were produced commercially by Carter and Sons of Poole, Dorset. In 1952, she was made a member of the national Council of Industrial Design. Angus was also interested in mural painting and made several murals for private clients.David Bailey (2004). Steeped in History (Winter). Retrieved 19 January 2009. She tested her designs on demonstration lengths of lining paper. Architects who saw these encouraged her to develop a hand-printed wallpaper business. This coincided with the 1960s expansion of DIY and the development of 'choose your own colour mix' vinyl emulsion paints which she used with hand-cut linoleum printing blocks. She won the Sanderson Centenary wallpaper prize but their subsequent commercial version, which had the regularity of a machine printed design, was far less restful to the eye than the subtle changes of pigment and pressure when done by her own methods. The artist always wanted her designs to be a sympathetic background on which to hang pictures. She continued to print her own designs with the help of a team of willing apprentices. Angus's paintings of the family of Ramsay MacDonald and of John Piper hang in the National Portrait Gallery in London.Ramsay MacDonald with members of his family (includes Peggy Angus; Ishbel Allan MacDonald (Mrs Peterkin); Malcolm John MacDonald; Ramsay MacDonald), BBC Your paintings. retrieved 18 January 2014. Ishbel MacDonald was a lifelong friend; Angus occasionally stayed at Chequers with her and enjoyed the subversiveness of drawing cartoons for the Daily Worker while she was there. =Furlongs= Interior at Furlongs 1939, by Eric Ravilious From 1933 onwards Angus rented a shepherd's cottage, Furlongs, near Beddingham at the foot of the South Downs, and made that a home to which a circle of artists of gathered. These included Eric Ravilious and John Piper. Ravilious considered that his time at Furlongs: Ravilious made many drawings and paintings of the Downs around Furlongs and of the cottage inside and out. He and Peggy both made paintings together at the quarry and cement works at Asham nearby. Other visitors included Herbert Read, Olive Cook and Edwin Smith and Percy Horton and architects Moholy-Nagy, Serge Chermayeff, Ern≈ë Goldfinger, Frederick Gibberd, Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew. Her lifelong friendship with John Piper and Myfanwy Evans resulted in a long correspondence about Folk Art and Popular Art. =Teacher= Peggy Angus was a part-time teacher for much of her life and believed her teaching was as important as creating her own work. Post-war she taught briefly alongside Quentin Bell at a private girls' school in Sussex (they had been friends and colleagues in the Artists International Association). From 1930 to 1946, Angus taught art at secondary schools in Sussex and London, before returning to the North London Collegiate School in 1947. As Head of Art at the North London Collegiate School for Girls, her own old school, she believed in setting up communal projects where pupils' works could be displayed to their best advantage. These projects also improved the school's visual environment and expanded her influence beyond the art rooms. She wanted to encourage a sense of patronage and visual literacy for all, including those not thinking of following an artistic career. She remained a teacher at the school until 1970.

BC-610-I Transmitter History In the early 1940s, the U.S. military sought a high-powered radio transmitter capable of infallible voice communications over 100 miles (160 km), sturdy enough to work in all conditions, flexible enough to be able to cover a wide range of frequencies, self-powered and able to operate in motion or at fixed locations. The Hallicrafters HT-4 transmitter was chosen from units available from various U.S. radio manufacturers. The HT-4 was designed for amateur radio use and had been commercially available for several years at a price of approximately $700, rivaling the cost of a car. It was considered compact and stable for its era and could deliver in excess of 300 watts of power for voice or MCW communications and 400 watts during Morse code operation. As was typical in physically large vacuum tube equipment, the manual cautions power output is less at higher frequencies. It was quartz crystal controlled, but could be used over a wide range of frequencies through use of the master-oscillator power amplifier. Modifications requested by the Signal Corps were performed by Hallicrafters' engineers working with U.S. Army technicians at Fort Monmouth. They made a new version of the HT-4, which was known as the BC-610 transmitter, a part of the SCR-299 mobile communications unit, and production began in 1942. General Dwight Eisenhower credited the SCR-299 in the reorganization of U.S. forces, which led to their victory against the Nazis at Kasserine Pass. The SCR-299 was also used in the Invasion of Sicily and later, Italy. A BC-610 transmitter was used by double agent Juan Pujol Garc√≠a during WWII as part of Operation Fortitude. Clear reception by the Germans of messages transmitted by Garc√≠a, code name GARBO, were so crucial to the Allied deception that use of the relatively high-powered transmitter was deemed necessary.British Intelligence in the Second World War: Volume 4, Security and Counter-Intelligence. Cambridge University Press; 31 August 1990. . p. 312‚Äì. Over 25,000 units were produced by Hallicrafters and other allied companies. In 1944, a short subject film was produced by the Jam Handy Organization and sponsored by the Hallicrafters Company detailing how the HT-4 transmitter was adapted for military service and dramatizing its use by the U.S. military during World War II.

It studies resources for life on planets, asteroids and comets, around various stars, in galaxies, and in the universe. The results allow estimating the future prospects for life, from planetary to galactic and cosmological scales. Available energy, and microgravity, radiation, pressure and temperature are physical factors that affect astroecology. The ways by which life can reach space environments, including natural panspermia and directed panspermia are also considered. Further, for human expansion in space and directed panspermia, motivation by life-centered biotic ethics, panbiotic ethics and planetary bioethics are also relevant. Overview The term \\"astroecology\\" was first applied in the context of performing studies in actual meteorites to evaluate their potential resources favorable to sustaining life. Early results showed that meteorite/asteroid materials can support microorganisms, algae and plant cultures under Earth's atmosphere and supplemented with water. Several observations suggest that diverse planetary materials, similar to meteorites collected on Earth, could be used as agricultural soils, as they provide nutrients to support microscopic life when supplemented with water and an atmosphere. Experimental astroecology has been proposed to rate planetary materials as targets for astrobiology exploration and as potential biological in-situ resources. The biological fertilities of planetary materials can be assessed by measuring water-extractable electrolyte nutrients. The results suggest that carbonaceous asteroids and Martian basalts can serve as potential future resources for substantial biological populations in the Solar System. Analysis of the essential nutrients (C, N, P, K) in meteorites yielded information for calculating the amount of biomass that can be constructed from asteroid resources. For example, carbonaceous asteroids are estimated to contain about 1022 kg potential resource materials, and laboratory results suggest that they could yield a biomass on the order of 6¬∑1020 kg, about 100,000 times more than biological matter presently on Earth. Cultures on simulated asteroid/meteorite materials To quantify the potential amounts of life in biospheres, theoretical astroecology attempts to estimate the amount of biomass over the duration of a biosphere. The resources, and the potential time-integrated biomass were estimated for planetary systems, for habitable zones around stars, and for the galaxy and the universe. Such astroecology calculations suggest that the limiting elements nitrogen and phosphorus in the estimated 1022 kg carbonaceous asteroids could support 6¬∑1020 kg biomass for the expected five billion future years of the Sun, yielding a future time- integrated BIOTA (BIOTA, Biomass Integrated Over Times Available, measured in kilogram-years) of 3¬∑1030 kg-years in the Solar System, a hundred thousand times more than life on Earth to date. Considering biological requirements of 100 W kg‚àí1 biomass, radiated energy about red giant stars and white and red dwarf stars could support a time-integrated BIOTA up to 1046 kg-years in the galaxy and 1057 kg-years in the universe. Such astroecology considerations quantify the immense potentials of future life in space, with commensurate biodiversity and possibly, intelligence. Chemical analysis of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites show that they contain extractable bioavailable water, organic carbon, and essential phosphate, nitrate and potassium nutrients. The results allow assessing the soil fertilities of the parent asteroids and planets, and the amounts of biomass that they can sustain. Laboratory experiments showed that material from the Murchison meteorite, when ground into a fine powder and combined with Earth's water and air, can provide the nutrients to support a variety of organisms including bacteria (Nocardia asteroides), algae, and plant cultures such as potato and asparagus. The microorganisms used organics in the carbonaceous meteorites as the carbon source. Algae and plant cultures grew well also on Mars meteorites because of their high bio-available phosphate contents. The Martian materials achieved soil fertility ratings comparable to productive agricultural soils. This offers some data relating to terraforming of Mars. Terrestrial analogues of planetary materials are also used in such experiments for comparison, and to test the effects of space conditions on microorganisms. The biomass that can be constructed from resources can be calculated by comparing the concentration of elements in the resource materials and in biomass (Equation 1). A given mass of resource materials (mresource) can support mbiomass, X of biomass containing element X (considering X as the limiting nutrient), where cresource, X is the concentration (mass per unit mass) of element X in the resource material and cbiomass, X is its concentration in the biomass. m_{biomass,\\\\, X} = m_{resource,\\\\, X} \\\\frac{c_{resource,\\\\, X}}{c_{biomass,\\\\, X}} (1) Assuming that 100,000 kg biomass supports one human, the asteroids may then sustain about 6e15 (six million billion) people, equal to a million Earths (a million times the present population). Similar materials in the comets could support biomass and populations about one hundred times larger. Solar energy can sustain these populations for the predicted further five billion years of the Sun. These considerations yield a maximum time-integrated BIOTA of 3e30 kg-years in the Solar System. After the Sun becomes a white dwarf star, and other white dwarf stars, can provide energy for life much longer, for trillions of eons. (Table 2) Effects of wastage Astroecology also concerns wastage, such as the leakage of biological matter into space. This will cause an exponential decay of space-based biomass as given by Equation (2), where M (biomass 0) is the mass of the original biomass, k is its rate of decay (the fraction lost in a unit time) and biomass t is the remaining biomass after time t. :Equation 2: M_{biomass}(t) = M_{biomass} (0) e^{-kt}\\\\, Integration from time zero to infinity yields Equation (3) for the total time-integrated biomass (BIOTA) contributed by this biomass: :Equation 3: BIOTA = \\\\frac{M_{biomass} (0)}{k} For example, if 0.01% of the biomass is lost per year, then the time-integrated BIOTA will be 10,000M_{biomass} (0). For the 6¬∑1020 kg biomass constructed from asteroid resources, this yields 6¬∑1024 kg-years of BIOTA in the Solar System. Even with this small rate of loss, life in the Solar System would disappear in a few hundred thousand years, and the potential total time-integrated BIOTA of 3¬∑1030 kg-years under the main-sequence Sun would decrease by a factor of 5¬∑105, although a still substantial population of 1.2¬∑1012 biomass-supported humans could exist through the habitable lifespan of the Sun. The integrated biomass can be maximized by minimizing its rate of dissipation. If this rate can be reduced sufficiently, all the constructed biomass can last for the duration of the habitat and it pays to construct the biomass as fast as possible. However, if the rate of dissipation is significant, the construction rate of the biomass and its steady-state amounts may be reduced allowing a steady-state biomass and population that lasts throughout the lifetime of the habitat. An issue that arises is whether we should build immense amounts of life that decays fast, or smaller, but still large, populations that last longer. Life-centered biotic ethics suggests that life should last as long as possible. Galactic ecology If life reaches galactic proportions, technology should be able to access all of the materials resources, and sustainable life will be defined by the available energy. The maximum amount of biomass about any star is then determined by the energy requirements of the biomass and by the luminosity of the star. For example, if 1 kg biomass needs 100 Watts, we can calculate the steady-state amounts of biomass that can be sustained by stars with various energy outputs. These amounts are multiplied by the life-time of the star to calculate the time-integrated BIOTA over the life-time of the star. Using similar projections, the potential amounts of future life can then be quantified. For the Solar System from its origins to the present, the current 1015 kg biomass over the past four billion years gives a time-integrated biomass (BIOTA) of 4¬∑1024 kg-years. In comparison, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and water in the 1022 kg asteroids allows 6¬∑1020 kg biomass that can be sustained with energy for the 5 billion future years of the Sun, giving a BIOTA of 3¬∑1030 kg-years in the Solar System and 3¬∑1039 kg-years about 1011 stars in the galaxy. Materials in comets could give biomass and time- integrated BIOTA a hundred times larger. The Sun will then become a white dwarf star, radiating 1015 Watts that sustains 1e13 kg biomass for an immense hundred million trillion (1020) years, contributing a time-integrated BIOTA of 1033 years. The 1012 white dwarfs that may exist in the galaxy during this time can then contribute a time-integrated BIOTA of 1045 kg-years. Red dwarf stars with luminosities of 1023 Watts and life-times of 1013 years can contribute 1034 kg-years each, and 1012 red dwarfs can contribute 1046 kg- years, while brown dwarfs can contribute 1039 kg-years of time-integrated biomass (BIOTA) in the galaxy. In total, the energy output of stars during 1020 years can sustain a time-integrated biomass of about 1045 kg-years in the galaxy. This is one billion trillion (1020) times more life than has existed on the Earth to date. In the universe, stars in 1011 galaxies could then sustain 1057 kg-years of life. Directed panspermia The astroecology results above suggest that humans can expand life in the galaxy through space travel or directed panspermia. The amounts of possible life that can be established in the galaxy, as projected by astroecology, are immense. These projections are based on information about 15 billion past years since the Big Bang, but the habitable future is much longer, spanning trillions of eons. Therefore, physics, astroeclogy resources, and some cosmological scenarios may allow organized life to last, albeit at an ever slowing rate, indefinitely. These prospects may be addressed by the long-term extension of astroecology as cosmoecology.

He joined the Royal Artillery and while serving in Glasgow took up association football as a goalkeeper with Junior side, Benburb. =Royal Artillery (Portsmouth)= By 1893, he was a member of the Royal Artillery side which reached the final of the FA Amateur Cup in 1896 as well as two Army Cup finals. In the 1896 Amateur Cup final, played against Bishop Auckland, Reilly was voted \\"Man of the Match\\" when he kept the score down to a 1‚Äì0 defeat. There is evidence that because of his Gaelic football background where players can handle the ball, when he made a save he would dribble the ball downfield Gaelic football fashion. Because of this practice, the box was added to the football pitch preventing the goalkeeper from touching the ball with his hands outside the box. In December 1895, he played two matches on loan to Southampton who were playing their second season in the Southern League. He replaced Tom Cain and both matches (against Reading and Royal Ordnance) ended in 5‚Äì0 victories. He was described in the local press as a \\"brilliant\\" player, who was both quick and sure in his handling and kicking. He also spent a period on loan to another Southampton side, Freemantle. He became a key member of the Royal Artillery side and helped them rise to join the Second Division of the Southern League in 1897 and win the Division title at the end of the 1897‚Äì98 season. The R.A. were less successful in their first season in the top division, finishing at the foot of the table, and subsequently the club folded. =Portsmouth= By now, Reilly's military career was over and in July 1899, he was snapped up by manager Frank Brettell and joined Portsmouth who had been founded a year earlier and were elected as members of an expanded Southern League for the 1899‚Äì00 season. During Reilly's five seasons at Fratton Park, Portsmouth were one of the dominant teams in the Southern League, winning the championship in 1901‚Äì02, and never finishing outside the top four. He was awarded a benefit match, played against West Ham United, on 29 April 1901. Reilly was recognised for his form with selection for Ireland on two occasions, both narrow defeats by England in 1900 and 1902. For the first match, played at Lansdowne Road, Dublin on 17 March 1900, the England team were confidently expecting an easy match after five successive victories, including winning 13‚Äì2 the previous year. The England selectors chose five debutantes, including Reilly's Portsmouth colleague, Dan Cunliffe, who made his solitary England appearance at inside right. In the event, the game was far more difficult than expected, with England only managing a 2‚Äì0 victory, with goals from Charlie Sagar and Harry Johnson, who were also both making their international debut. Reilly was not selected for the 1901 match against England, played at The Dell, but was called up again for the 1902 match, played at the Balmoral Showgrounds, Belfast on 22 March 1902. This time, England's margin of victory was even narrower, with the only goal coming from Jimmy Settle with less than five minutes remaining, after England's goalkeeper, Billy George, had saved a penalty from Robert Milne. =Later career= In 1904, after five season with Portsmouth, Reilly moved to Scotland where he spent a season with Dundee, managing only three appearances. Reilly spent the 1905‚Äì06 season in the Football League with Notts County. He made an inauspicious start in a 3‚Äì0 defeat at Stoke and lost his place mid-season to Albert Iremonger (who was the tallest player in the league at the time, measuring 6 ft 6 inNottingham Evening Post \\"Bygones\\" (2 May 2008) p. 33). In October 1906, he returned to the Southern League, after a transfer to Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of ¬£100. After a season in London, Reilly returned to Dublin to play for Shelbourne, helping them reach the 1908 Irish Cup Final, where he finished on the losing side to Dublin rivals, Bohemians, going down 3‚Äì1 in a replay. On his retirement, he returned to Hampshire, becoming a publican in Southsea. He remained fondly remembered at Fratton Park and was amongst the guests who celebrated Portsmouth's fiftieth anniversary in 1948. He died in his native Dublin in December 1954, aged 80.

It focused on weather conditions for the evening commute. It also recapped the day's weather and delivered the forecast for tomorrow. Program history PM Edition and sister program Afternoon Outlook were launched in fall 2003 and helped finish the compartmentalization of the TWC programming day, which transformed the network from just Weather Center to a myriad of different shows with set hosts and tone. The original pair of meteorologists for the program was Carl Parker and Kristina Abernathy. The program, originally two hours in length airing from 6pm to 8pm Eastern Time was expanded to three hours, airing from 4pm to 7pm eastern on September 25, 2006 as a result of the cancellation of Afternoon Outlook and the debut of Abrams And Bettes: Beyond The Forecast. In September 2007, the program once again returned to two hours in length airing from 5pm to 7pm eastern. In March 2009, the show returned to three hours in length replacing the afternoon hour of Weather Center, which was revamped as a primetime program. The format of the program was slightly different on the weekends as the program aired late at night during the weekends, which from 11pm to 2am eastern. The weekend format primarily focuses on the day's significant weather events similar to Evening Edition and the weeknight version of Weather Center. In the event an ongoing significant weather event occurred (e.g., severe weather outbreak, winter storm, hurricane threatening the United States), the weekday edition of PM Edition began one hour earlier, preempting long-form programming during the 3pm-4pm eastern timeslot. A major shift in The Weather Channel's programming schedule began on September 27, 2010. With this change, PM Edition became a weekend only show, airing four hour-long blocks at 4pm, 7pm, 10pm and 1am Eastern Time. Carl Parker and Heather Tesch, the hosts of Weekend Now, became the hosts of the 4pm eastern hour, while Kim Cunningham and Adam Berg stayed as hosts of the remaining hour-long blocks. Soon after, PM Edition only aired a one-hour block at 4pm eastern and was replaced with Weather Center for the remaining hour blocks. Due to this, Maria LaRosa and Todd Santos began hosting the 4pm eastern hour of PM Edition. On March 31, 2012, PM Edition came to an official end. A week prior, schedule changes were announced that involved moving the weekend afternoon schedule to all days, with Weather Center Live airing at 4pm Eastern Time. The addition of Weather Center Live airing at 4pm Eastern Time was implemented into the weekend schedule, thus ending PM Edition's runtime.

Climate   History  Before the Spanish conquest, the site where the town of Dzidzant√∫n now stands was part of the lands under the chieftainship of Ah Kin Chel. After the area was conquered by the Spaniards, an encomienda was established in 1549, granting Hern√°n Mu√±oz Vaquiano use over the lands in the area in exchange for taking care of the indigenous people who lived here. Yucat√°n declared its independence from the Spanish Crown in 1821 and in 1825, the town was assigned to the Temax Municipality. In 1918, the Dzidzant√∫n Municipality was created, with the town of Dzidzant√∫n as the headquarters of the administration.  Location  This town is in the coastal region known as the northern Gulf of Mexico. It falls within the parallel 21¬∞ 12' and 21¬∞ 23' latitude north and between 88¬∞ 57' and 89¬∞ 04' west longitude and has an average height of 4 meters. It is bounded on the north by the Gulf of Mexico, south to the cities of Temax and Cansahcab, east to the town of Dzilam Gonzalez and to the west of the town of Yoba√≠n.  Festivals and culture  Festivals observed in the town include: * Festivities in honor of Santa Clara, taking place in January. * June 10-13, a festival in honor of San Antonio de Padua, patron of the people. * August 8-14, a festival in honor of Santa Clara, patron of the people (August 11). During festivals, it is the custom for women to use simple Huipil, highlighting the embroidered square neck and cutting edge clothing. This is placed over the shaft, which is subject to a ripple bottom half at the waist with a girdle of the same fabric; fitted sandals and sun protection are covered with a shawl. Farmers, especially the elderly, are dressed in baggy trousers, blankets, raw abotonada front shirts, apron Cotia and straw hats. For major events and Vaquer√≠as women wear a Terno dress, made of fine fabrics, lace and embroidery generally made by hand in a cross stitch. This is supplemented with long gold chains, earrings, coral beads or watermark rebozo and Santa Maria. The men wear white trousers made of straight cut Philippine fine cloth, hats, sandals and Jipijapa, as well as the traditional red scarf bandana popularly known as essential to the Jarana dance.

The seismic movement was so significant that in a zone named Valecillo, a new lake was formed and the river Yurub√≠ was dammed up. Numerous rivulets changed their course in the Caracas valley, which was flooded with dirty water. Based on contemporary descriptions, the earthquake is believed to have consisted of two seismic shocks occurring within the span of 30 minutes. The first destroyed Caracas and the second M√©rida, where it was raining when the shock occurred. Response The destruction in Caracas was so widespread that the Gazeta de Caracas suggested founding a new capital city in \\"‚Ä¶the beautiful [...] Catia where pure air may be breathed‚Ä¶\\". Since the earthquake occurred on Maundy Thursday while the Venezuelan War of Independence was raging, it was explained by royalist authorities as divine punishment for the rebellion against the Spanish Crown.

She had a varied career as a teacher and an administrator of mathematical organizations, culminating in the position of Executive Director of the Mathematical Association of America. After retirement she started a new career in environmental education, specializing in children's programs such as GreenKids. Life and education Sward was born Marcia Ruth Peterson in Maywood, Illinois on February 1, 1939. She received a bachelor's degree from Vassar College in 1961. She received a master's degree in 1963 and a PhD in mathematics in 1967 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her PhD thesis was written under Edward J. Scott and titled The Mixed Boundary Value Problem Along the Line of Parabolicity for a Certain Class of Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations. Sward died in Washington, D.C. on September 21, 2008. Work Sward was unable to get an academic job immediately after receiving her PhD, and worked as a housemother at Catholic University in Washington, D.C. She then received an appointment at Trinity College in Washington, D.C., and worked there from 1968 to 1980 and was department head from 1979 to 1980. Sward then switched in mid-career from academic to nonprofit organization executive. She stated in an interview with Association Management magazine that one reason was a low threshold of boredom, but also emphasized the need to stretch one's skills. She said, \\"As a professor I really didn't manage anything. The focus was on the intellectual work. So when I switched to association management, I had to learn how to manage programs, delegate, work with committees, raise money, work with budgets.\\" Her first executive position was as the first Associate Executive Director of the Mathematical Association of America. Among the duties of the newly created position were directing the organization's three journals and creating a newsletter that turned out to be MAA FOCUS. Sward became the newsletter's first editor and held that position for the remainder of her time as Associate Executive Director. She left the MAA in September 1985 to become the first Executive Director of the Mathematical Sciences Education Board of the United States National Research Council, then returned in 1989 as Executive Director of the MAA upon the retirement of Alfred B. Willcox. During this time she helped create many new programs, for example Project NExT, for which she persuaded ExxonMobil to provide funding. She worked with Ed Dubinsky to develop Special Interest Groups inside MAA. She received the Citation for Public Service from the Council of the American Mathematical Society in 1992. In 1999 Sward retired from the Executive Director position and spent a year sailing in The Bahamas.

Family and early life Hamilton was born on 26 December 1747, the third and youngest son of Lord Anne Hamilton, who was the third and youngest son of James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton.; his middle name was from his mother, Anna Charlotta Maria Powell. He joined the navy and saw some service during the American War of Independence. He was advanced to the rank of post- captain on 18 May 1779 and by the end of the war was in command of the frigate HMS Apollo. War with the French With the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793 Hamilton was assigned to command the 74-gun third rate . In November 1794 the Canada and the , the latter under Captain Richard Rodney Bligh, had been assigned to escort a convoy from England to Cape St Vincent. While the two warships were returning they were spotted by a French squadron under Joseph-Marie Nielly, consisting of five 74 gun ships of the line, three large frigates and a brig. Outnumbered the British ships attempted to escape, but began to be overhauled by the French. Bligh eventually turned and engaged the French, allowing Hamilton aboard the Canada to escape. After an unequal engagement during which the Alexander was reduced to a sinking condition, Bligh struck his colours. Shortly after Hamilton's return to England he was transferred to the 98-gun second rate . Hamilton and the Prince were assigned to the fleet under Admiral Alexander Hood, which in June 1795 came across a French fleet under Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse, and which included the captured Alexander off Groix. The Alexander had been taken into the French navy after her surrender, and after an engagement termed the Battle of Groix, the British recaptured her. Though Hamilton was present, he was not directly engaged in the fighting. Family and later life Hamilton was promoted rear-admiral on 20 February 1797, vice-admiral on 1 January 1801 and admiral on 28 April 1808. He married Lucretia Prosser in May 1777, having two sons with her. The younger, Augustus Hamilton, also joined the navy, becoming a lieutenant. Correspondence between Vice-Admiral Hamilton and Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson in 1803 indicates that the elder Hamilton asked Nelson to find a place for his son aboard , but that Nelson was unable to oblige. Admiral Charles Powell Hamilton died at Fir Hill, near Droxford, Hampshire on 12 March 1825, at the age of 77. Following the death in 1895 of William Douglas- Hamilton, 12th Duke of Hamilton without male issue, Hamilton's great-grandson, Alfred Douglas Hamilton inherited the Dukedom of Hamilton.

Thompson (born December 18, 1926) is a Canadian businessman, philanthropist, and sportsman. He is best known for designing and building the Miss Supertest hydroplanes. Thompson was born in London, Ontario to \\"Colonel\\" J. Gordon Thompson and Essie McCreery. The couple also had two daughters named Catherine and Essie. His father \\"Colonel\\" J. Gordon was a businessman involved in the manufacturing of gasoline pumps, and subsequently the selling of gasoline, a sportsman and a golfer who founded the Sunningdale Golf and Country Club. The Thompson Recreation and Athletic Centre at Western in London, Ontario was named in his honour. Thompson attended primary school in London and secondary school in St. Catharines, Ontario at Ridley College. In 1944, he graduated as a naval officer from the Royal Canadian Naval College/Royal Roads Military College. Thompson also spent two years studying engineering at the University of Toronto, and one year studying business at the University of Western Ontario. While attending the University of Toronto (Engineering) and the University of Western Ontario (Business), he continued to serve with the Naval Reserve on HMCS York and HMCS Prevost. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he competed in unlimited hydroplane racing. In 1950, Thompson and his father bought a hydroplane named Miss Canada IV from a retired racer named Harold Wilson. The Thompsons later renamed the boat Miss Supertest I and refurbished it. However, mechanical problems would lead Thompson to abandon Miss Supertest I and set his sights on designing and building a new boat. In 1954, he and his team built Miss Supertest II. She was long, wide, and equipped with a Rolls-Royce Griffon motor. On November 1, 1957, Miss Supertest II set a world Canadian and British Empire speed record for propeller-driven craft straightaway speed record of in Picton, Ontario. Miss Supertest II was retired the following year, and Thompson began designing his next boat. Miss Supertest III, which also featured a Rolls-Royce Griffon motor, was designed specifically to compete for the Harmsworth Cup. Miss Supertest III was christened in 1959 and went on to win the 1959 Detroit Memorial Regatta and the Harmsworth Cup in 1959, 1960, and 1961. When Miss Supertest III won the 1959 Harmsworth Trophy for Canada it ended 39 years of American domination. When Miss Supertest III's pilot, Bob Hayward, was killed in 1961 while driving Miss Supertest II in the Detroit River Silver Cup races in 1961, Thompson retired from racing. He said: \\"With the untimely death of Bob Hayward, the members of our racing team would derive little satisfaction from further success.\\" In 1959, Thompson was elected into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame and inducted in 1960. During the same year he received the Medal of Honour from the Union of International Motorboating. He also became the president of Supertest Petroleum Corporation Limited, a position he held until the company was purchased by British Petroleum in 1971. Lakeshore Toronto; Joy Gas Station, not Supertest Thompson was inducted into the Canadian Boating Federation Hall of Fame in 1995. In 2005, he was inducted into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame, along with the London Sports Hall of Fame. He served as honorary Colonel of the 1st Hussars Regiment (RCAC) from 1979 to 1999. Thompson has also been involved in the operations of the golf course that his father co-founded in London, Ontario during the Great Depression. He was appointed Chairman of the Building and Construction Committee at Sunningdale Golf and Country Club in 1972. He initiated and completed a study on water requirements and clubhouse expansion needs for future years. Then in 1983 he was elected President of the Club. Currently, Thompson serves as Greens Committee Chairman. Thompson is now retired and lives in London, Ontario with his wife Beverly. The couple supports a number of local charities. They have five children and 15 grandchildren.

Most US ships that are destroyers or larger (but not destroyer escorts or escort carriers) employed gun fire-control systems for and larger guns, up to battleships, such as . Beginning with ships built in the 1960s, warship guns were largely operated by computerized systems, i.e. systems that were controlled by electronic computers, which were integrated with the ship's missile fire-control systems and other ship sensors. As technology advanced, many of these functions were eventually handled fully by central electronic computers. The major components of a gun fire-control system are a human-controlled director, along with or later replaced by radar or television camera, a computer, stabilizing device or gyro, and equipment in a plotting room. For the US Navy, the most prevalent gunnery computer was the Ford Mark 1, later the Mark 1A Fire Control Computer, which was an electro-mechanical analog ballistic computer that provided accurate firing solutions and could automatically control one or more gun mounts against stationary or moving targets on the surface or in the air. This gave American forces a technological advantage in World War II against the Japanese who did not develop remote power control for their guns; both the US Navy and Japanese Navy used visual correction of shots using shell splashes or air bursts, while the US Navy augmented visual spotting with radar. Digital computers would not be adopted for this purpose by the US until the mid-1970s; however, it must be emphasized that all analog anti-aircraft fire control systems had severe limitations, and even the US Navy's Mark 37 system required nearly 1000 rounds of mechanical fuze ammunition per kill, even in late 1944.Campbell, Naval Weapons of WW2, p. 106 The MarkK 37 Gun Fire Control System incorporated the Mark 1 computer, the Mark 37 director, a gyroscopic stable element along with automatic gun control, and was the first US Navy dual-purpose GFCS to separate the computer from the director.  History of analogue fire control systems  Naval fire control resembles that of ground- based guns, but with no sharp distinction between direct and indirect fire. It is possible to control several same-type guns on a single platform simultaneously, while both the firing guns and the target are moving. Though a ship rolls and pitches at a slower rate than a tank does, gyroscopic stabilization is extremely desirable. Naval gun fire control potentially involves three levels of complexity: * Local control originated with primitive gun installations aimed by the individual gun crews. * The director system of fire control was incorporated first into battleship designs by the Royal Navy in 1912. All guns on a single ship were laid from a central position placed as high as possible above the bridge. The director became a design feature of battleships, with Japanese \\"Pagoda-style\\" masts designed to maximize the view of the director over long ranges. A fire control officer who ranged the salvos transmitted elevations and angles to individual guns. * Coordinated gunfire from a formation of ships at a single target was a focus of battleship fleet operations. An officer on the flagship would signal target information to other ships in the formation. This was necessary to exploit the tactical advantage when one fleet succeeded in crossing the T of the enemy fleet, but the difficulty of distinguishing the splashes made walking the rounds in on the target more difficult. Corrections can be made for surface wind velocity, roll and pitch of the firing ship, powder magazine temperature, drift of rifled projectiles, individual gun bore diameter adjusted for shot-to-shot enlargement, and rate-of-change of range with additional modifications to the firing solution based upon the observation of preceding shots. More sophisticated fire control systems consider more of these factors rather than relying on simple correction of observed fall of shot. Differently colored dye markers were sometimes included with large shells so individual guns, or individual ships in formation, could distinguish their shell splashes during daylight. Early \\"computers\\" were people using numerical tables. = Pre- dreadnought director system = The Royal Navy had a proposal for salvo firing from a single fire control director on hand, but not yet implemented it in 1904. The Royal Navy considered Russia a potential adversary through The Great Game, and sent Commander Walter Hugh ThringWalter Hugh Charles Samuel Thring (1873‚Äì1949) https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/thring-walter-hugh-8804 of the Navy Gunnery Division with an early example of Dumaresq to Japan during the Russo-Japanese War. His mission was to guide and train the Japanese naval gunnery personnel in the latest technological developments, but more importantly for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), he was aware of the proposal. During the 10 August 1904 Battle of the Yellow Sea against the Russian Pacific Fleet, the British-built IJN battleship Asahi and her sister ship, the fleet flagship Mikasa, were equipped with the latest Barr and Stroud range finders on the bridge, but the ships were not designed for coordinated aiming and firing. Asahis chief gunnery officer, Hiroharu Kato (later Commander of Combined Fleet), experimented with the first director system of fire control, using speaking tube (voicepipe) and telephone communication from the spotters high on the mast to his position on the bridge where he performed the range and deflection calculations, and from his position to the gun turrets forward and astern.Barr & Stroud -metre rangefinder, on display on Mikasa, Yokosuka, Japan https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%89%E7%AC%A0_(%E6%88%A6%E8%89%A6)#/media/%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AB:MIKASASOKKYOGI.JPG With the semi-synchronized salvo firing upon his voice command from the bridge, the spotters using stopwatches on the mast could identify the distant salvo of splashes created by the shells from their own ship more effectively than trying to identify a single shell splash among the many. Kato gave the firing order consistently at a particular moment in the rolling and pitching cycles of the ship, simplifying firing and correction duties formerly performed independently with varying accuracy using artificial horizon gauges in each turret.Imperial Japanese Navy Records, Report from Battleship Mikasa No. 205, Classified, 1904 Kato was transferred to Mikasa as the Chief Gunnery Officer, and his primitive director system was in fleet-wide operation by the time the Japanese fleet destroyed the Russian Baltic Fleet (renamed the 2nd and 3rd Pacific Fleet) in the Battle of Tsushima during 27-28 May 1905. = Central fire control and World War I = Centralized naval fire control systems were first developed around the time of World War I.For a description of one, see US Naval Fire Control, 1918. Local control had been used up until that time, and remained in use on smaller warships and auxiliaries through World War II. Specifications of were finalized after the report on the Battle of Tsushima was submitted by the official observer to IJN onboard Asahi, Captain Pakenham (later Admiral), who observed how Kato system worked first hand. From this design on, large warships had a main armament of one size of gun across a number of turrets (which made corrections simpler still), facilitating central fire control via electric triggering. The UK built their first central system before the Great War. At the heart was an analogue computer designed by Commander (later Admiral Sir) Frederic Charles Dreyer that calculated range rate, the rate of change of range due to the relative motion between the firing and target ships. The Dreyer Table was to be improved and served into the interwar period at which point it was superseded in new and reconstructed ships by the Admiralty Fire Control Table. The use of Director-controlled firing together with the fire control computer moved the control of the gun laying from the individual turrets to a central position (usually in a plotting room protected below armor), although individual gun mounts and multi-gun turrets could retain a local control option for use when battle damage prevented the director setting the guns. Guns could then be fired in planned salvos, with each gun giving a slightly different trajectory. Dispersion of shot caused by differences in individual guns, individual projectiles, powder ignition sequences, and transient distortion of ship structure was undesirably large at typical naval engagement ranges. Directors high on the superstructure had a better view of the enemy than a turret mounted sight, and the crew operating it were distant from the sound and shock of the guns. = Analogue computed fire control = Unmeasured and uncontrollable ballistic factors like high altitude temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, wind direction and velocity required final adjustment through observation of fall of shot. Visual range measurement (of both target and shell splashes) was difficult prior to availability of radar. The British favoured coincidence rangefinders while the Germans and the US Navy, stereoscopic type. The former were less able to range on an indistinct target but easier on the operator over a long period of use, the latter the reverse. During the Battle of Jutland, while the British were thought by some to have the finest fire control system in the world at that time, only three percent of their shots actually struck their targets. At that time, the British primarily used a manual fire control system. This experience contributed to computing rangekeepers becoming standard issue. The US Navy's first deployment of a rangekeeper was on in 1916. Because of the limitations of the technology at that time, the initial rangekeepers were crude. For example, during World War I the rangekeepers would generate the necessary angles automatically but sailors had to manually follow the directions of the rangekeepers. This task was called \\"pointer following\\" but the crews tended to make inadvertent errors when they became fatigued during extended battles. During World War II, servomechanisms (called \\"power drives\\" in the US Navy) were developed that allowed the guns to automatically steer to the rangekeeper's commands with no manual intervention, though pointers still worked even if automatic control was lost. The Mark 1 and Mark 1A computers contained approximately 20 servomechanisms, mostly position servos, to minimize torque load on the computing mechanisms. = Radar and World War II = During their long service life, rangekeepers were updated often as technology advanced and by World War II they were a critical part of an integrated fire control system. The incorporation of radar into the fire control system early in World War II provided ships with the ability to conduct effective gunfire operations at long range in poor weather and at night. In a typical World War II British ship the fire control system connected the individual gun turrets to the director tower (where the sighting instruments were) and the analogue computer in the heart of the ship. In the director tower, operators trained their telescopes on the target; one telescope measured elevation and the other bearing. Rangefinder telescopes on a separate mounting measured the distance to the target. These measurements were converted by the Fire Control Table into bearings and elevations for the guns to fire on. In the turrets, the gunlayers adjusted the elevation of their guns to match an indicator which was the elevation transmitted from the Fire Control Table‚Äîa turret layer did the same for bearing. When the guns were on target they were centrally fired.B.R. 901/43, Handbook of The Admiralty Fire Control Clock Mark I and I* The Aichi Clock Company first produced the Type 92 Shagekiban low angle analog computer in 1932. The US Navy Rangekeeper and the Mark 38 GFCS had an edge over Imperial Japanese Navy systems in operability and flexibility. The US system allowing the plotting room team to quickly identify target motion changes and apply appropriate corrections. The newer Japanese systems such as the Type 98 Hoiban and Shagekiban on the were more up to date, which eliminated the Sokutekiban, but it still relied on seven operators. In contrast to US radar aided system, the Japanese relied on averaging optical rangefinders, lacked gyros to sense the horizon, and required manual handling of follow-ups on the Sokutekiban, Shagekiban, Hoiban as well as guns themselves. This could have played a role in Center Force's battleships' dismal performance in the Battle off Samar in October 1944. In that action, American destroyers pitted against the world's largest armored battleships and cruisers dodged shells for long enough to close to within torpedo firing range, while lobbing hundreds of accurate automatically aimed rounds on target. Cruisers did not land hits on splash-chasing escort carriers until after an hour of pursuit had reduced the range to . Although the Japanese pursued a doctrine of achieving superiority at long gun ranges, one cruiser fell victim to secondary explosions caused by hits from the carriers' single 5-inch guns. Eventually with the aid of hundreds of carrier based aircraft, a battered Center Force was turned back just before it could have finished off survivors of the lightly armed task force of screening escorts and escort carriers of Taffy 3. The earlier Battle of Surigao Strait had established the clear superiority of US radar-assisted systems at night. The rangekeeper's target position prediction characteristics could be used to defeat the rangekeeper. For example, many captains under long range gun attack would make violent maneuvers to \\"chase salvos.\\" A ship that is chasing salvos is maneuvering to the position of the last salvo splashes. Because the rangekeepers are constantly predicting new positions for the target, it is unlikely that subsequent salvos will strike the position of the previous salvo. The direction of the turn is unimportant, as long as it is not predicted by the enemy system. Since the aim of the next salvo depends on observation of the position and speed at the time the previous salvo hits, that is the optimal time to change direction. Practical rangekeepers had to assume that targets were moving in a straight-line path at a constant speed, to keep complexity to acceptable limits. A sonar rangekeeper was built to include a target circling at a constant radius of turn, but that function had been disabled. Only the RNHowse, Radar at Sea. HMAS Shropshire, for example, demonstrated complete blindfire control at the Battle of Surigao Straits. and USN achieved 'blindfire' radar fire-control, with no need to visually acquire the opposing vessel. The Axis powers all lacked this capability. Classes such as Iowa and South Dakota battleships could lob shells over visual horizon, in darkness, through smoke or weather. American systems, in common with many contemporary major navies, had gyroscopic stable vertical elements, so they could keep a solution on a target even during maneuvers. By the start of World War II British, German and American warships could both shoot and maneuver using sophisticated analog fire-control computers that incorporated gyro compass and gyro Level inputs.Friedman, Naval Firepower. In the Battle of Cape Matapan the British Mediterranean Fleet using radar ambushed and mauled an Italian fleet, although actual fire was under optical control using starshell illumination. At the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal , in complete darkness, inflicted fatal damage at close range on the battleship using a combination of optical and radar fire-control; comparisons between optical and radar tracking, during the battle, showed that radar tracking matched optical tracking in accuracy, while radar ranges were used throughout the battle.USS Washington Action Report, Night of November 14‚Äì15, 1942. pp. 17‚Äì18. The last combat action for the analog rangekeepers, at least for the US Navy, was in the 1991 Persian Gulf War when the rangekeepers on the s directed their last rounds in combat.

US Navy analogue Gun Fire Control Systems (GFCS)  = MK 33 GFCS = The Mk 33 GFCS was a power-driven fire control director, less advanced than the MK 37. The Mark 33 GFCS used a Mk 10 Rangekeeper, analog fire-control computer. The entire rangekeeper was mounted in an open director rather than in a separate plotting room as in the RN HACS, or the later Mk 37 GFCS, and this made it difficult to upgrade the Mk 33 GFCS.Campbell, Naval Weapons of WW2 It could compute firing solutions for targets moving at up to 320 knots, or 400 knots in a dive. Its installations started in the late 1930s on destroyers, cruisers and aircraft carriers with two Mk 33 directors mounted fore and aft of the island. They had no fire-control radar initially, and were aimed only by sight. After 1942, some of these directors were enclosed and had a Mk 4 fire- control radar added to the roof of the director, while others had a Mk 4 radar added over the open director. With the Mk 4 large aircraft at up to 40,000 yards could be targeted. It had less range against low-flying aircraft, and large surface ships had to be within 30,000 yards. With radar, targets could be seen and hit accurately at night, and through weather.Harold Stockton The Mark 33 and 37 systems used tachymetric target motion prediction.Naval Weapons of WW2, Campbell The USN never considered the Mk 33 to be a satisfactory system, but wartime production problems, and the added weight and space requirements of the Mk 37 precluded phasing out the Mk 33: = MK 37 GFCS = According to the US Navy Bureau of Ordinance, > While the defects were not prohibitive and the Mark 33 remained in > production until fairly late in World War II, the Bureau started the > development of an improved director in 1936, only 2 years after the first > installation of a Mark 33.

The computer was completed as the Ford Mk 1 computer by 1935. Rate information for height changes enabled complete solution for aircraft targets moving over . Destroyers starting with the employed one of these computers, battleships up to four. The system's effectiveness against aircraft diminished as planes became faster, but toward the end of World War II upgrades were made to the Mk37 System, and it was made compatible with the development of the VT (Variable Time) proximity fuze which exploded when it was near a target, rather than by timer or altitude, greatly increasing the probability that any one shell would destroy a target.  Mark 37 Director  Mk 37 Director above bridge of destroyer , backfitted with postwar SPG-25 radar antenna The function of the Mark 37 Director, which resembles a turret with \\"ears\\" rather than guns, was to track the present position of the target in bearing, elevation, and range. To do this, it had optical sights (the rectangular windows or hatches on the front), an optical rangefinder (the tubes or ears sticking out each side), and later models, fire control radar antennas. The rectangular antenna is for the Mark 12 FC radar, and the parabolic antenna on the left (\\"orange peel\\") is for the Mk 22 FC radar. They were part of an upgrade to improve tracking of aircraft. The Director Officer also had a slew sight used to quickly point the director towards a new target. Up to four Mark 37 Gun Fire Control Systems were installed on battleships. On a battleship, the director was protected by of armor, and weighs 21 tons. The Mark 37 director aboard is protected with of armor plate and weighs 16 tons. gun on the Fletcher-class destroyer Stabilizing signals from the Stable Element kept the optical sight telescopes, rangefinder, and radar antenna free from the effects of deck tilt. The signal that kept the rangefinder's axis horizontal was called \\"crosslevel\\"; elevation stabilization was called simply \\"level\\". Although the stable element was below decks in Plot, next to the Mk.1/1A computer, its internal gimbals followed director motion in bearing and elevation so that it provided level and crosslevel data directly. To do so, accurately, when the fire control system was initially installed, a surveyor, working in several stages, transferred the position of the gun director into Plot so the stable element's own internal mechanism was properly aligned to the director. Although the rangefinder had significant mass and inertia, the crosslevel servo normally was only lightly loaded, because the rangefinder's own inertia kept it essentially horizontal; the servo's task was usually simply to ensure that the rangefinder and sight telescopes remained horizontal. Mk. 37 director train (bearing) and elevation drives were by D.C. motors fed from Amplidyne rotary power-amplifying generators. Although the train Amplidyne was rated at several kilowatts maximum output, its input signal came from a pair of 6L6 audio beam tetrode vacuum tubes (valves, in the U.K.).  Plotting room  In battleships, the Secondary Battery Plotting Rooms were down below the waterline and inside the armor belt. They contained four complete sets of the fire control equipment needed to aim and shoot at four targets. Each set included a Mark 1A computer, a Mark 6 Stable Element, FC radar controls and displays, parallax correctors, a switchboard, and people to operate it all. (In the early 20th century, successive range and/or bearing readings were probably plotted either by hand or by the fire control devices (or both). Humans were very good data filters, able to plot a useful trend line given somewhat-inconsistent readings. As well, the Mark 8 Rangekeeper included a plotter. The distinctive name for the fire-control equipment room took root, and persisted even when there were no plotters.)  Ford Mark 1A Fire Control Computer  Mark 1A Computer The Mark 1A Fire Control Computer was an electro-mechanical analog ballistic computer. Originally designated the Mark 1, design modifications were extensive enough to change it to \\"Mk. 1A\\". The Mark 1A appeared post World War II and may have incorporated technology developed for the Bell Labs Mark 8, Fire Control Computer.Annals of the History of Computing, Volume 4, Number 3, July 1982 \\"Electrical Computers for Fire Control\\", p. 232, W. H. C. Higgins, B. D. Holbrook, and J. W. Emling Sailors would stand around a box measuring . Even though built with extensive use of an aluminum alloy framework (including thick internal mechanism support plates) and computing mechanisms mostly made of aluminum alloy, it weighed as much as a car, about , with the Star Shell Computer Mark 1 adding another . It used 115 volts AC, 60 Hz, single phase, and typically a few amperes or even less. Under worst-case fault conditions, its synchros apparently could draw as much as 140 amperes, or 15,000 watts (about the same as 3 houses while using ovens). Almost all of the computer's inputs and outputs were by synchro torque transmitters and receivers. Its function was to automatically aim the guns so that a fired projectile would collide with the target. This is the same function as the main battery's Mk 8 Rangekeeper used in the Mark 38 GFCS except that some of the targets the Mark 1A had to deal with also moved in elevation‚Äîand much faster. For a surface target, the Secondary Battery's Fire Control problem is the same as the Main Battery's with the same type inputs and outputs. The major difference between the two computers is their ballistics calculations. The amount of gun elevation needed to project a shell is very different from the elevation needed to project a shell the same distance. In operation, this computer received target range, bearing, and elevation from the gun director. As long as the director was on target, clutches in the computer were closed, and movement of the gun director (along with changes in range) made the computer converge its internal values of target motion to values matching those of the target. While converging, the computer fed aided-tracking (\\"generated\\") range, bearing, and elevation to the gun director. If the target remained on a straight-line course at a constant speed (and in the case of aircraft, constant rate of change of altitude (\\"rate of climb\\"), the predictions became accurate and, with further computation, gave correct values for the gun lead angles and fuze setting. Concisely, the target's movement was a vector, and if that didn't change, the generated range, bearing, and elevation were accurate for up to 30 seconds. Once the target's motion vector became stable, the computer operators told the gun director officer (\\"Solution Plot!\\"), who usually gave the command to commence firing. Unfortunately, this process of inferring the target motion vector required a few seconds, typically, which might take too long. The process of determining the target's motion vector was done primarily with an accurate constant-speed motor, disk-ball-roller integrators, nonlinear cams, mechanical resolvers, and differentials. Four special coordinate converters, each with a mechanism in part like that of a traditional computer mouse, converted the received corrections into target motion vector values. The Mk. 1 computer attempted to do the coordinate conversion (in part) with a rectangular-to polar converter, but that didn't work as well as desired (sometimes trying to make target speed negative!). Part of the design changes that defined the Mk. 1A were a re-thinking of how to best use these special coordinate converters; the coordinate converter (\\"vector solver\\") was eliminated. The Stable Element, which in contemporary terminology would be called a vertical gyro, stabilized the sights in the director, and provided data to compute stabilizing corrections to the gun orders. Gun lead angles meant that gun-stabilizing commands differed from those needed to keep the director's sights stable. Ideal computation of gun stabilizing angles required an impractical number of terms in the mathematical expression, so the computation was approximate. To compute lead angles and time fuze setting, the target motion vector's components as well as its range and altitude, wind direction and speed, and own ship's motion combined to predict the target's location when the shell reached it. This computation was done primarily with mechanical resolvers (\\"component solvers\\"), multipliers, and differentials, but also with one of four three-dimensional cams. Based on the predictions, the other three of the three-dimensional cams provided data on ballistics of the gun and ammunition that the computer was designed for; it could not be used for a different size or type of gun except by rebuilding that could take weeks. Servos in the computer boosted torque accurately to minimize loading on the outputs of computing mechanisms, thereby reducing errors, and also positioned the large synchros that transmitted gun orders (bearing and elevation, sight lead angles, and time fuze setting).These were electromechanical \\"bang-bang\\", yet had excellent performance. The anti-aircraft fire control problem was more complicated because it had the additional requirement of tracking the target in elevation and making target predictions in three dimensions. The outputs of the Mk 1A were the same (gun bearing and elevation), except fuze time was added. The fuze time was needed because the ideal of directly hitting the fast moving aircraft with the projectile was impractical. With fuze time set into the shell, it was hoped that it would explode near enough to the target to destroy it with the shock wave and shrapnel. Towards the end of World War II, the invention of the VT proximity fuze eliminated the need to use the fuze time calculation and its possible error. This greatly increased the odds of destroying an air target. Digital fire control computers were not introduced into service until the mid-1970s. Central aiming from a gun director has a minor complication in that the guns are often far enough away from the director to require parallax correction so they aim correctly. In the Mk. 37 GFCS, the Mk1 / 1A sent parallax data to all gun mounts; each mount had its own scale factor (and \\"polarity\\") set inside the train (bearing) power drive (servo) receiver-regulator (controller). Twice in its history, internal scale factors were changed, presumably by changing gear ratios. Target speed had a hard upper limit, set by a mechanical stop. It was originally , and subsequently doubled in each rebuild. These computers were built by Ford Instrument Company, Long Island City, Queens, New York. The company was named after Hannibal C. Ford, a genius designer, and principal in the company. Special machine tools machined face cam grooves and accurately duplicated 3-D ballistic cams. Generally speaking, these computers were very well designed and built, very rugged, and almost trouble-free, frequent tests included entering values via the handcranks and reading results on the dials, with the time motor stopped. These were static tests. Dynamic tests were done similarly, but used gentle manual acceleration of the \\"time line\\" (integrators) to prevent possible slippage errors when the time motor was switched on; the time motor was switched off before the run was complete, and the computer was allowed to coast down. Easy manual cranking of the time line brought the dynamic test to its desired end point, when dials were read. As was typical of such computers, flipping a lever on the handcrank's support casting enabled automatic reception of data and disengaged the handcrank gear. Flipped the other way, the gear engaged, and power was cut to the receiver's servo motor. The mechanisms (including servos) in this computer are described superbly, with many excellent illustrations, in the Navy publication OP 1140. There are photographs of the computer's interior in the National Archives; some are on Web pages, and some of those have been rotated a quarter turn.  Stable Element  Mark 6 Stable Element The function of the Mk 6 Stable Element (pictured) in this fire control system is the same as the function of the Mk 41 Stable Vertical in the main battery system. It is a vertical seeking gyroscope (\\"vertical gyro\\", in today's terms) that supplies the system with a stable up direction on a rolling and pitching ship. In surface mode, it replaces the director's elevation signal. It also has the surface mode firing keys. It is based on a gyroscope that erects so its spin axis is vertical. The housing for the gyro rotor rotates at a low speed, on the order of 18 rpm. On opposite sides of the housing are two small tanks, partially filled with mercury, and connected by a capillary tube. Mercury flows to the lower tank, but slowly (several seconds) because of the tube's restriction. If the gyro's spin axis is not vertical, the added weight in the lower tank would pull the housing over if it were not for the gyro and the housing's rotation. That rotational speed and rate of mercury flow combine to put the heavier tank in the best position to make the gyro precess toward the vertical. When the ship changes course rapidly at speed, the acceleration due to the turn can be enough to confuse the gyro and make it deviate from true vertical. In such cases, the ship's gyrocompass sends a disabling signal that closes a solenoid valve to block mercury flow between the tanks. The gyro's drift is low enough not to matter for short periods of time; when the ship resumes more typical cruising, the erecting system corrects for any error. The Earth's rotation is fast enough to need correcting. A small adjustable weight on a threaded rod, and a latitude scale makes the gyro precess at the Earth's equivalent angular rate at the given latitude. The weight, its scale, and frame are mounted on the shaft of a synchro torque receiver fed with ship's course data from the gyro compass, and compensated by a differential synchro driven by the housing- rotator motor. The little compensator in operation is geographically oriented, so the support rod for the weight points east and west. At the top of the gyro assembly, above the compensator, right on center, is an exciter coil fed with low-voltage AC. Above that is a shallow black-painted wooden bowl, inverted. Inlaid in its surface, in grooves, are two coils essentially like two figure 8s, but shaped more like a letter D and its mirror image, forming a circle with a diametral crossover. One coil is displaced by 90 degrees. If the bowl (called an \\"umbrella\\") is not centered above the exciter coil, either or both coils have an output that represents the offset. This voltage is phase- detected and amplified to drive two DC servo motors to position the umbrella in line with the coil. The umbrella support gimbals rotate in bearing with the gun director, and the servo motors generate level and crosslevel stabilizing signals. The Mk. 1A's director bearing receiver servo drives the pickoff gimbal frame in the stable element through a shaft between the two devices, and the Stable Element's level and crosslevel servos feed those signals back to the computer via two more shafts. (The sonar fire-control computer aboard some destroyers of the late 1950s required roll and pitch signals for stabilizing, so a coordinate converter containing synchros, resolvers, and servos calculated the latter from gun director bearing, level, and crosslevel.)  Fire Control Radar  The fire-control radar used on the Mk 37 GFCS has evolved. In the 1930s, the Mk 33 Director did not have a radar antenna. The Tizard Mission to the United States provided the USN with crucial data on UK and Royal Navy radar technology and fire-control radar systems. In September 1941, the first rectangular Mk 4 Fire-control radar antenna was mounted on a Mk 37 Director,Naval Weapons of WW2, Campbell, p. 111 and became a common feature on USN Directors by mid 1942. Soon aircraft flew faster, and in c1944 to increase speed and accuracy the Mk 4 was replaced by a combination of the Mk 12 (rectangular antenna) and Mk 22 (parabolic antenna) \\"orange peel\\" radars. (pictured) in the late 1950s, Mk. 37 directors had Western Electric Mk. 25 X-band conical-scan radars with round, perforated dishes. Finally, the circular SPG 25 antenna was mounted on top. = MK 38 GFCS = The Mk38 Gun Fire Control System (GFCS) controlled the large main battery guns of Iowa- class battleships. The radar systems used by the Mk 38 GFCS were far more advanced than the primitive radar sets used by the Japanese in World War II. The major components were the director, plotting room, and interconnecting data transmission equipment. The two systems, forward and aft, were complete and independent. Their plotting rooms were isolated to protect against battle damage propagating from one to the other.  Director  Mark 38 Director The forward Mk38 Director (pictured) was situated on top of the fire control tower. The director was equipped with optical sights, optical Mark 48 Rangefinder (the long thin boxes sticking out each side), and a Mark 13 Fire Control Radar antenna (the rectangular shape sitting on top). The purpose of the director was to track the target's present bearing and range. This could be done optically with the men inside using the sights and Rangefinder, or electronically with the radar. (The fire control radar was the preferred method.) The present position of the target was called the Line-Of-Sight (LOS), and it was continuously sent down to the plotting room by synchro motors. When not using the radar's display to determine Spots, the director was the optical spotting station.  Plotting room  USS Missouris Main Plot, c. 1950 The Forward Main Battery Plotting Room was located below the waterline and inside the armored belt. It housed the forward system's Mark 8 Rangekeeper, Mark 41 Stable Vertical, Mk13 FC Radar controls and displays, Parallax Correctors, Fire Control Switchboard, battle telephone switchboard, battery status indicators, assistant Gunnery Officers, and Fire Controlmen (FC's)(between 1954 and 1982, FC's were designated as Fire Control Technicians (FT's)). Mark 8 Rangekeeper The Mk8 Rangekeeper was an electromechanical analog computer whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), to hit a future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ships Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's deck tilt, sensed as level and crosslevel), and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FT's made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With all this information, the rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between its ship and the target. It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position at the end of the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, Magnus Effect of the spinning projectile, stabilizing signals originating in the Stable Vertical, Earth's curvature, and Coriolis effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered. Mark 41 Stable Vertical The Mk 41 Stable Vertical was a vertical seeking gyroscope, and its function was to tell the rest of the system which-way-is-up on a rolling and pitching ship. It also held the battery's firing keys. The Mk 13 FC Radar supplied present target range, and it showed the fall of shot around the target so the Gunnery Officer could correct the system's aim with range and deflection spots put into the rangekeeper. It could also automatically track the target by controlling the director's bearing power drive. Because of radar, Fire Control systems are able to track and fire at targets at a greater range and with increased accuracy during the day, night, or inclement weather. This was demonstrated in November 1942 when the battleship engaged the Imperial Japanese Navy battlecruiser at a range of at night. The engagement left Kirishima in flames, and she was ultimately scuttled by her crew. This gave the United States Navy a major advantage in World War II, as the Japanese did not develop radar or automated fire control to the level of the US Navy and were at a significant disadvantage. The parallax correctors are needed because the turrets are located hundreds of feet from the director. There is one for each turret, and each has the turret and director distance manually set in. They automatically received relative target bearing (bearing from own ship's bow), and target range. They corrected the bearing order for each turret so that all rounds fired in a salvo converged on the same point. Fire Control Switchboard The fire control switchboard configured the battery. With it, the Gunnery Officer could mix and match the three turrets to the two GFCSs. He could have the turrets all controlled by the forward system, all controlled by the aft system, or split the battery to shoot at two targets. The assistant Gunnery Officers and Fire Control Technicians operated the equipment, talked to the turrets and ship's command by sound-powered telephone, and watched the Rangekeeper's dials and system status indicators for problems. If a problem arose, they could correct the problem, or reconfigure the system to mitigate its effect. = MK 51 Fire Control System = Mark 51 Director with Mark 14 (40 mm) Gun Sight The Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns were arguably the best light anti-aircraft weapon of World War II., employed on almost every major warship in the U.S. and UK fleet during World War II from about 1943 to 1945. They were most effective on ships as large as destroyer escorts or larger when coupled with electric-hydraulic drives for greater speed and the Mark 51 Director (pictured) for improved accuracy, the Bofors 40 mm gun became a fearsome adversary, accounting for roughly half of all Japanese aircraft shot down between 1 October 1944 and 1 February 1945. = MK 56 GFCS = This GFCS was an intermediate-range, anti-aircraft gun fire-control system. It was designed for use against high-speed subsonic aircraft. It could also be used against surface targets. It was a dual ballistic system. This means that it was capable of simultaneously producing gun orders for two different gun types (e.g.: 5\\"/38cal and 3\\"/50cal) against the same target. Its Mk 35 Radar was capable of automatic tracking in bearing, elevation, and range that was as accurate as any optical tracking. The whole system could be controlled from the below decks Plotting Room with or without the director being manned. This allowed for rapid target acquisition when a target was first detected and designated by the ship's air-search radar, and not yet visible from on deck. Its target solution time was less than 2 seconds after Mk 35 radar \\"Lock on\\". It was designed toward the end of World War II, apparently in response to Japanese kamikaze aircraft attacks. It was conceived by Ivan Getting, mentioned near the end of his Oral history, and its linkage computer was designed by Anton√≠n Svoboda. Its gun director was not shaped like a box, and it had no optical rangefinder. The system was manned by crew of four. On the left side of the director, was the Cockpit where the Control Officer stood behind the sitting Director Operator (Also called Director Pointer). Below decks in Plot, was the Mk 4 Radar Console where the Radar Operator and Radar Tracker sat. The director's movement in bearing was unlimited because it had slip-rings in its pedestal. (The Mk. 37 gun director had a cable connection to the hull, and occasionally had to be \\"unwound\\".) Fig. 26E8 on this Web page shows the director in considerable detail. The explanatory drawings of the system show how it works, but are wildly different in physical appearance from the actual internal mechanisms, perhaps intentionally so. However, it omits any significant description of the mechanism of the linkage computer. That chapter is an excellent detailed reference that explains much of the system's design, which is quite ingenious and forward-thinking in several respects. In the 1968 upgrade to for service off Vietnam, three Mark 56 Gun Fire Control Systems were installed. Two on either side just forward of the aft stack, and one between the aft mast and the aft Mk 38 Director tower. This increased New Jersey's anti-aircraft capability, because the Mk 56 system could track and shoot at faster planes. = MK 68 GFCS = 5 inch Mark 42 gun turret Introduced in the early 1950s, the MK 68 was an upgrade from the MK 37 effective against air and surface targets. It combined a manned topside director, a conical scan acquisition and tracking radar, an analog computer to compute ballistics solutions, and a gyro stabilization unit. The gun director was mounted in a large yoke, and the whole director was stabilized in crosslevel (the yoke's pivot axis). That axis was in a vertical plane that included the line of sight. At least in 1958, the computer was the Mk. 47, an hybrid electronic/electromechanical system. Somewhat akin to the Mk. 1A, it had electrical high-precision resolvers instead of the mechanical one of earlier machines, and multiplied with precision linear potentiometers. However, it still had disc/roller integrators as well as shafting to interconnect the mechanical elements. Whereas access to much of the Mk. 1A required time-consuming and careful disassembly (think days in some instances, and possibly a week to gain access to deeply buried mechanisms), the Mark 47 was built on thick support plates mounted behind the front panels on slides that permitted its six major sections to be pulled out of its housing for easy access to any of its parts. (The sections, when pulled out, moved fore and aft; they were heavy, not counterbalanced. Typically, a ship rolls through a much larger angle than it pitches.) The Mk. 47 probably had 3-D cams for ballistics, but information on it appears very difficult to obtain. Mechanical connections between major sections were via shafts in the extreme rear, with couplings permitting disconnection without any attention, and probably relief springs to aid re-engagement. One might think that rotating an output shaft by hand in a pulled-out section would misalign the computer, but the type of data transmission of all such shafts did not represent magnitude; only the incremental rotation of such shafts conveyed data, and it was summed by differentials at the receiving end. One such kind of quantity is the output from the roller of a mechanical integrator; the position of the roller at any given time is immaterial; it is only the incrementing and decrementing that counts. Whereas the Mk. 1/1A computations for the stabilizing component of gun orders had to be approximations, they were theoretically exact in the Mk. 47 computer, computed by an electrical resolver chain. The design of the computer was based on a re-thinking of the fire control problem; it was regarded quite differently. Production of this system lasted for over 25 years. A digital upgrade was available from 1975 to 1985, and it was in service into the 2000s. The digital upgrade was evolved for use in the s. The AN/SPG-53 was a United States Navy gun fire-control radar used in conjunction with the Mark 68 gun fire-control system. It was used with the 5\\"/54 caliber Mark 42 gun system aboard s, s, s, Farragut-class destroyers, s, s as well as others. US Navy computerized fire control systems = MK 86 GFCS = Mk 45 lightweight gun turret The US Navy desired a digital computerized gun fire-control system in 1961 for more accurate shore bombardment. Lockheed Electronics produced a prototype with AN/SPQ-9 radar fire control in 1965. An air defense requirement delayed production with the AN/SPG-60 until 1971. The Mk 86 did not enter service until when the nuclear-powered missile cruiser was commissioned in February 1974, and subsequently installed on US cruisers and amphibious assault ships. The last US ship to receive the system, was commissioned in July 1994. The Mk 86 on Aegis-class ships controls the ship's 5\\"/54 caliber Mk 45 gun mounts, and can engage up to two targets at a time. It also uses a Remote Optical Sighting system which uses a TV camera with a telephoto zoom lens mounted on the mast and each of the illuminating radars. = MK 34 Gun Weapon System (GWS) = The MK 34 Gun Weapon System comes in various versions. It is an integral part of the Aegis combat weapon system on guided missile destroyers and Modified s. It combines the MK 45 5\\"/54 or 5\\"/60 Caliber Gun Mount, MK 46 Optical Sight System or Mk 20 Electro‚ÄìOptical Sight System and the MK 160 Mod 4‚Äì11 Gunfire Control System / Gun Computer System. Other versions of the Mk 34 GWS are used by foreign Navies as well as the US Coast Guard with each configuration having its own unique camera and / or gun system. It can be used against surface ship and close hostile aircraft, and as Naval Gunfire Support (NGFS) against shore targets. = MK 92 Fire Control System (FCS) = Mk 75 gun The Mark 92 fire control system, an Americanized version of the WM-25 system designed in The Netherlands, was approved for service use in 1975. It is deployed on board the relatively small and austere to control the MK 75 Naval Gun and the MK 13 Guided Missile Launching System (missiles have since been removed since retirement of its version of the Standard missile). The Mod 1 system used in PHMs (retired) and the US Coast Guard's WMEC and WHEC ships can track one air or surface target using the monopulse tracker and two surface or shore targets. Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates with the Mod 2 system can track an additional air or surface target using the Separate Track Illuminating Radar (STIR). = = Used in the Mk 34 Gun Weapon System, the Mk 160 Gun Computing System (GCS) contains a gun console computer (GCC), a computer display console (CDC), a magnetic tape recorder-reproducer, a watertight cabinet housing the signal data converter and gun mount microprocessor, a gun mount control panel (GMCP), and a velocimeter.http://fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/swos/gunno/INFO24.html  See also  * Close-in weapon system * Director (military) * Fire-control system Ground, sea and air based systems * Mathematical discussion of rangekeeping * Rangekeeper shipboard analog fire-control computer  Notes  Citations  Bibliography        External links  * The British High Angle Control System (HACS) * Best Battleship Fire control ‚Äì Comparison of World War II battleship systems * Appendix one, Classification of Director Instruments * HACS III Operating manual Part 1 * HACS III Operating manual Part 2 * USS Enterprise Action Log * The RN Pocket Gunnery Book * Fire Control Fundamentals * Manual for the Mark 1 and Mark 1a Computer * Maintenance Manual for the Mark 1 Computer * Manual for the Mark 6 Stable Element * Gun Fire Control System Mark 37 Operating Instructions at ibiblio.org * Director section of Mark 1 Mod 1 computer operations at NavSource.org * Naval Ordnance and Gunnery, Vol. 2, Chapter 25, AA Fire Control Systems Anti- aircraft artillery Military computers Naval weapons of the United States Naval artillery fire control system Artillery operation World War II naval weapons Artillery of the United States Fire-control computers of World War II ","title":"Ship gun fire-control system"},{"id":"21169433","text":"The Eureka Union School District is a primary education school district in Placer County, California overseeing schools for grades kindergarten through 8th in parts of East Roseville and Granite Bay.

TwitPic was often used by citizen journalists to upload and distribute pictures in near real-time as an event was taking place. History TwitPic was launched in 2008 by Noah Everett. In an interview with Mixergy, Everett revealed that he had been offered a price in the range of 10 million US dollars for his company but he declined the offer. In 2011, Everett launched Heello, a service that also supports text posts and videos but is less dependent on Twitter. TwitPic's first app was released on 7 May 2012. Starting mid-2011, Twitter users could upload Photos directly on Twitter itself, reducing the need to use services like TwitPic. On September 4, 2014, TwitPic announced that it would shut down on September 25, 2014, following rapidly declining usage and trademark infringement threats by Twitter (who threatened to revoke access to the service's APIs if they did not withdraw their filings to trademark \\"Twitpic\\"). However, shortly afterward on September 18, 2014, TwitPic announced that it would not shut down, as it had been acquired by an unspecified company. However, the following month, TwitPic announced that the deal had fallen through, and that they would shut down on October 25, 2014. On October 25, 2014, Twitpic announced that they had reached an agreement with Twitter to give them the TwitPic domain and photo archive. Description TwitPic could be used independently of Twitter as an image hosting website similar to Flickr. However, several characteristics made this site a companion for Twitter: * TwitPic uses usernames and passwords from Twitter * Comments to photographs are sent as reply tweets * TwitPic URLs are already short, making it unnecessary to use URL shortening Anyone with a Twitter account was eligible to post pictures on the site. , TwitPic altered their terms of use, allowing them to distribute the photographs people have uploaded to their \\"Affiliates\\". However, TwitPic refused to state who these affiliates may be and what they gain by distributing the pictures. This triggered a public inquiry by users over the possibility of TwitPic publishing user content without compensation. As a result, people began boycotting TwitPic and removing all of their images. TwitPic addressed these concerns in a blog post, claiming that the changes in the terms had been misinterpreted.

Of the nearly 2.25 million daily image shares on Twitter, 45.7% of them came from TwitPic.

Janis Krums, a passenger on one of the ferries who rushed to help, took a picture of the downed plane as passengers were still evacuating, and tweeted it via TwitPic before traditional media arrived at the scene. The TwitPic service crashed as thousands of people tried to access the photo at the same time. TwitPic also crashed on April 1, 2009, as a result of the large number of photos (and people viewing these photos) being posted from the G20 protests in London.

He was a Two Time Honorable Mention All American Catcher for Elon University 1988‚Äì1990, and was later selected in the 9th round of the 1990 Amateur Draft. He spent four seasons as Elon's Pitching coach before becoming head coach. Kennedy was selected to serve as the pitching coach for the USA Baseball's National Team (Collegiate) during the summer. Prior to the 2010 season Kennedy led Elon to 436 victories in his 13 years, and has led the team to 19 victories over teams ranked in the top 25 in the past 11 years (Calvert, 2009). During the 2010 season, Kennedy led the Phoenix to back-to-back road wins against highly ranked Clemson University as well as a home win against University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and wins against Wake Forest and N.C. State. The 2010 team made it past the Socon Tournament and into the NCAA Regional rounds. On April 24, 2011, Kennedy won his 500th game at Elon as the Phoenix defeated Georgia Southern by a final of 9‚Äì0. Kennedy's program has won 40 or more games in three of the last seven seasons and boasts four Southern Conference regular-season crowns. With each victory tallied, Kennedy adds to his record for the most wins by an Elon baseball coach that he set in 2003. In his 16 seasons, Kennedy has guided the Phoenix to 543 victories. In the last 14 seasons, Elon has had 22 victories over opponents ranked in the top-25. In his tenure, Kennedy has led his program to 49 victories over Atlantic Coast Conference opponents. In 2012, Kennedy led his Phoenix squad to yet another top-three finish in the SoCon as the maroon and gold went 33‚Äì26 overall and 20‚Äì10 in league action. Kennedy's teams have now posted at least 30 victories in each of their 13 official NCAA Division I seasons. At the conclusion of the season, two Elon players were selected in the Major League Baseball First-Year Player Draft. Two Phoenix standouts were also recognized with All-Southern Conference accolades. During the 2011 season, Kennedy collected his 500th career victory as his Phoenix shutout league rival Georgia Southern 9‚Äì0 on April 24. The squad won the program's fourth Southern Conference regular- season crown by churning out 23 league victories. Overall, the team posted a 36‚Äì21 record. Following the year, four Elon players were selected in the Major League Baseball First-Year Player Draft and a fifth signed a free agent contract. Four members of the squad were also recognized with all-league accolades, including John Brebbia who was chosen as the SoCon Pitcher of the Year.

Program history Day Planner was added in 2003 as one of the last programs to be added to The Weather Channel's morning programming block. For all intents and purposes, its format was similar to Your Weather Today, but the primary focus for the show was towards Middle America and the West Coast. While the show originally aired from 9 a.m. to noon Eastern Time when it premiered, its schedule was shifted to 11 a.m.-2 p.m. ET; this time shifting had put Day Planner into the morning hours for the regions. In the event an ongoing significant weather event occurred (e.g., severe weather outbreak, winter storm, hurricane threatening the United States), Day Planner would be extended by an hour, preempting long-form programming during the 2-3 p.m. eastern timeslot. On September 27, 2010, as part of TWC's major schedule change, Day Planner was expanded to 5pm (7pm in case of severe weather). Another major shift occurred to Day Planner on March 26, 2012. Day Planner returned to the former timeslot 11am-2pm, with long-form programming replacing it from 2-4 p.m. ET, and an afternoon edition of Weather Center Live was added from 4-5 p.m. ET. Nick Walker and Vivian Brown, who had previously anchored Day Planner during the 2-5 p.m. ET timeslot, were moved up to this timeslot, replacing Heather Tesch and Carl Parker. Tesch moved to Weekend Now and the weekend afternoon edition of Weather Center Live, while Parker became the channel's storm specialist providing tropical weather updates during Day Planner and Weather Center Live as well as a fill-in host. In the event of extended coverage, Day Planner would finish at 3 p.m. ET. After a ten-year run, the final broadcast of Day Planner occurred on November 11, 2013, the day before the Weather Channel's 2013 relaunch. Day Planner was replaced with the new all-day Weather Center Live program beginning on November 12, 2013. In 2016, Rumors started spreading on Wikipedia that Day Planner and other shows on The Weather Channel returning, but as of 2020, nothing has been said by The Weather Channel if it is going to happen. It is believed the relaunch has been postponed to the summer of 2021, which by then they may be back in the studio.

The cease-fire followed twenty-two days of bombardment by land, sea and air which left over 1,300 Palestinians dead and over 5,000 injured, and the death of 13 Israelis. The United Nations Development Programme warned that there will be long-term consequences of the attacks on Gaza because the livelihoods and assets of tens of thousands of Gaza civilians have been affected. Gaza humanitarian crisis Tent camp, Gaza Strip, April 2009 The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs states that the Gaza strip humanitarian crisis is significant and should not be understated. The UN stated in 2009 that the situation in the Gaza Strip was a \\"human dignity crisis,\\" entailing \\"a massive destruction of livelihoods and a significant deterioration of infrastructure and basic services.\\" Fear and panic were widespread, with 80 percent of the population unable to support themselves and dependent on humanitarian assistance. The International Red Cross said the situation was \\"intolerable\\" and a \\"full blown humanitarian crisis.\\" On 3 January, prior to the IDF ground operation, Israel's foreign minister Tzipi Livni stated that Israel had taken care to protect the civilian population of Gaza, and that it had kept the humanitarian situation \\"completely as it should be\\", maintaining Israel's earlier stance. The head of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, criticised Livni for the statement and further criticised the Security Council for not responding faster to the crisis. On subsequent reports, the UN stated that \\"only an immediate cease-fire will be able to address the large-scale humanitarian and protection crisis that faces the people of Gaza.\\" =Shelter= Protection and displacement UNRWA (as of 13 January) to house 37,937 Internally displaced Palestinians The UN described the situation as a \\"critical protection crisis\\". The entire civilian population in the Gaza strip remains vulnerable, the UN reported, with no safe haven, no bomb shelters and with closed borders, making it one of the rare conflicts where civilians have no place to flee. There is a sense of \\"panic, fear and distress\\" throughout the whole strip. Civilians have implemented a self-imposed curfew since no public warning systems or effective shelters exist. People have been evacuating their homes and staying in streets for long hours exposed to further danger, or staying with relatives. Civilians face insecurities while re-stocking basic food items, water and cooking gas. Children, 56% of the population, have no outlets and they remain \\"dangerously exposed\\" to the fighting around them. The Palestinian Red Crescent estimates that thousands of homes have been damaged and it became \\"increasingly difficult\\" for their residents to stay in them due to the cold weather. The UNRWA has prepared its schools to act as temporary shelters for displaced persons. As reported by both the Save the Children Alliance and the Al Mezan Center, prior to the IDF ground operation on 3 January, more than 13,000 people (2000 families) have been displaced in the strip. The majority of those families seek shelter with relatives while others are staying at the temporary emergency shelters provided by the UNRWA. As of the thirteenth of day the Israeli military operation, 21,200 displaced Palestinian people were staying at these shelters. By the third week of the attacks, this number has increased by 14,300 refugees, reaching 35,520 Palestinians staying under the UNRWA shelters. In the same period, Al Mezan Center also estimated that a total of 80,000-90,000 Palestinians have been displaced, including up to 50,000 children. As the numbers of displaced refugees constantly increased the UNRWA had to open new emergency shelters throughout the Gaza strip. The shelters were overcrowded and were sheltering double their originally planned capacities. Tent camp, Gaza Strip, April 2009 By 18 January, the number of Palestinians seeking the UNRWA shelters has peaked to around 51,000 displaced people, with only basic level of support due to the unprecedented number of refugees. After the unilateral lull, displaced persons began moving from the emergency centers. As of 23 January, UNRWA was still operating 15 emergency centers while aiming to close those shelters as soon as possible so that they can reopen the schools. As of 9 February, three non-school UNRWA shelters remain open, hosting 388 displaced people. Thousands of Gazans remain homeless. After the end of the Israeli operation and moving from the emergency shelters, many Palestinians (preliminary assessments shows 10,991 displaced households, or 71,657 people) have been homeless and remain with host families due to the extensive attacks. The host families are overstretched and face shortages of food, non-food items, water and electricity. Priority needs for those families include kitchen sets, hygiene kits, blankets, mattresses and plastic sheeting. One year after the ceasefire approximately 20,000 people remained displaced. Buildings destruction A satellite-based damage assessment of the Gaza Strip by the United Nations (UNOSAT). February 2009 Aid agencies have reported that Gaza \\"looks like earthquake zone\\": widespread destruction of houses, infrastructure, roads, greenhouses, cemeteries, mosques and schools are reported in Jabalia, Tal Al Hawa, Beit Hanoun, and Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip. According to the ICRC, \\"a number of areas, including parts of Beit Lahia looked like the aftermath of a strong earthquake\\". Meanwhile, Al Mezan Center field workers reported that \\"entire urban blocks have disappeared\\" in North Gaza and eastern of Gaza City. The International Red Cross reports that in Jabalia alone, between one and two thousand households are now living in the rubble of their houses. John Holmes, the Under-Secretary General of the United Nations, in his statement to the Security Council, reports that he saw an entire industrial and residential area in East Jabalia which had been \\"systematically bulldozed\\", an area of at least one square kilometer and that one of the best schools in Gaza is reduced to rubble 2,000 refugee families had their shelters totally destroyed. UNRWA was ready to provide cash assistance and shelter repair for those families, but has been unable to deliver this assistance to beneficiaries due to a shortage of liquidity and construction material in the Gaza Strip. An initial survey conducted by the UNDP estimates that 14,000 homes, 68 government buildings, and 31 non-governmental organization offices (NGOs) were either totally or partially damaged. As a result, an estimated 600,000 tonnes of concrete rubble will need to be removed. Since 2007, construction material have not permitted entry into Gaza, adversely affecting UN projects, in particular UNRWA and UNDP which were forced to suspend more than $100 million in construction projects due to lack of materials. Another UNDP rapid damage assessment of 170 out of the 407 government and private schools in the Gaza strip found that ten schools were severely damaged, and that 160 government and ten private schools were partially damaged during the Israeli military operation. Eight kindergartens were severely damaged and 60 were partially damaged. The UN humanitarian office stated that repairing such schools remains an urgent priority. Ten UNICEF tents were brought to Gaza to be used as learning spaces in the most damage-stricken areas. The Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories has confirmed that there is as yet no intention to revise the policy prohibiting clearance of reconstruction materials which would enable aid agencies working in Gaza to transition to rehabilitation and reconstruction. Damage in Jabalia, Gaza Strip A satellite- based damage assessment of the Gaza Strip by the United Nations revealed 2,692 destroyed and severely damaged buildings, 220 impact craters on roads and bridges with an estimated length of of paved and unpaved roads damaged, 714 impact craters on open ground or cultivated land with an estimated land area of , 187 greenhouses completely destroyed or severely damaged with an estimated area of , and of demolished zones targeted by IDF bulldozers, tanks and phosphorus shelling. Vandalization of Gazan homes by the Israeli defense forces has been reported: plastic bottles of urine and closed bags of excrement were left. There were also houses where excrement was smeared on the walls or in dry piles in corners. In many cases, Haaretz reports, smells indicates that soldiers had urinated on piles of clothing or inside a washing machine. In all the houses, the report continues, the toilets were overflowing and clogged, and there was \\"filth all around\\". The Associated Press reported that several homes had graffiti in Hebrew scribbled on the walls including \\"Death to the Arabs\\", \\"The eternal people have no fear\\", \\"Long live Jewish people\\" and other markings. On other incidents, an Israeli commander has reported that he has ordered his soldiers not to deface property and reprimanded anyone who did. =Health= Medical facilities and equipment Ambulance destroyed in the conflict Weakened by the eighteen- month Blockade of the Gaza Strip, as of 31 December the central drug store reported that 105 drugs and 255 medical supplies of the essential drug and supplies list are still unavailable, and approximately 20 percent of the ambulances were grounded due to lack of spare parts. Ambulances are experiencing difficulties in reaching the injured because of continuous fire. Hospitals reporting severe gas shortages expect total depletion in the coming days. As a result of shortages, the WFP distributed canned meat and high energy biscuits. The World Health Organization reported that at least 1,000 medical machines were out of order, with shortage of equipment and spare parts. Sources from the Palestinian Ministry of Health reported that the situation on 2 January, while extremely precarious, has stabilized after the arrival of medical supplies. From 4 January, all of Gaza City hospitals were without main electricity, depending on back-up generators that were close to collapse. From 4 to 5 January, UNRWA was forced to shut down 19 health centers due to hostilities in the area, and Ministry of Health closed down generators at ambulance stations, vaccine stores, labs and warehouses due to the lack of fuel to run the generators until more was delivered. There existed an urgent need for strong pain killers, body gas, bed sheets for wrapping the dead, and for neuro-, vascular-, orthopedic- and open heart surgeons. Collateral damages to hospitals like broken glass were not being repaired. The Palestinian Red Cross was unable to respond to many calls due to the military operations. Only urgent cases and surgery is being carried out in hospitals and all out-patient clinics have been closed. Al-Quds hospital, Gaza City, following Israeli shelling Only three out of the 56 primary health care clinics are open; 70% of the chronic disease patients regularly attending those centers had to interrupt their treatment due to the security situation. Chronically ill patients who were accessing care outside of the Gaza strip prior to the conflict urgently needed to resume their treatment. Because of the Israeli closure of the Gaza strip, which has lasted more than a year and a half, hospitals are run down and much of the equipment is unreliable and in need for repair. The UN labeled the importance of spare parts for medical equipment as a priority. By 2 February, most health facilities have resumed normal operation. Large volumes of medical supplies have been donated, but the most urgently needed equipment identified by the Palestinian Ministry of Health, notably pulse oximeters, defibrillators, infusion pumps, syringe pumps, ventilators, and anesthesia monitors, have still not been received. Psychotropic drugs are still lacking and urgently needed. In a damage assessment by the World Health Organization, 48% of the 122 health facilities assessed were found to be damaged or destroyed. 15 of Gaza's 27 hospitals and 41 primary health care centers has suffered damage. Two centers were destroyed, and 29 ambulances have been partially damaged or destroyed. The only rehabilitation center in Gaza has also suffered severe damage. Palestinian Ministry of Health reports 16 health staff were killed, and 22 injured while on duty. The policy of the Government of Israel is to condition the access of Palestinians who live in the Palestinian territories to healthcare in Israel upon financial coverage from the Palestinian Authority. In January 2009, following the war, the Palestinian Authority cancelled financial coverage for all medical care for Palestinians in Israeli hospitals, including coverage for chronically ill Palestinian patients, and those in need of complex care that is not available in other tertiary medical centers in the region. This decision was protested by human rights organizations. Population The UNFPA warns about serious risks that faces more than 40,000 pregnant women in Gaza. Stress, trauma, and poor nutrition could result in life-threatening complications along with silent death and injuries for such population. Due to the lack of warm clothing or blankets among the increasing number of displaced people, shock and trauma, an alarming number of premature labour and delivery and the exposure of newborn infants to hypothermia are reported. The organization has also voiced concerns about neonatal care post-crisis as many women who delivered their babies in hospitals during the crisis were sent home as early as 30 minutes after giving birth. The World Health Organization warns of the risk of an outbreak of epidemic disease due to unrecovered bodies, many severely decomposed, and due to the sewage flowing in Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahya. With the help of the Unicef, two therapy centers are working at full capacity to provide services for 120 malnutritioned, a medical condition of inadequate diet, children per day. Injured patients needing referral outside Gaza for specialized care were evacuated exclusively through the Egyptian Rafah border crossing. Gaza Ministry of Health reported that between 29 December and 22 January 608 injured were evacuated through Rafah. The Israeli Erez crossing was closed much of the period and only 30 patients were able to exit during the crisis. Handicap International estimates that up to 50 percent of people injured during the attacks have sustained severe injuries that will require rehabilitation to prevent permanent disability. Of the 1.5 million people living in the Gaza Strip, international and national agencies working in disability and rehabilitation estimate that, even before the military operation, over 10 percent had moderate or severe impairments. They estimate that as many as half of the 5,380 men, women and children injured over the past three weeks of conflict may suffer lifelong impairment, exacerbated by the inability of rehabilitation workers to provide early intervention. These agencies has highlighted the importance of providing early intervention for those newly injured, especially those discharged prematurely from health facilities; re-establishing and strengthening the capacity of rehabilitation services and disabled peoples organizations to respond to the increased need. This is especially critical given that the main provider of specialist rehabilitation services in Gaza sustained severe damage and is not yet fully operational. Even before 27 December, the first day of the attacks, there was already a back-log of people waiting for specialised services including rehabilitation and surgery. The Unicef and the International Red Cross warn from the dangers proposed by the unexploded ordnance, which killed two children as of 20 January. Gaza is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, which renders the problem much more acute. The unexploded ammunition problem represents a major threat for the population, the rescue teams working in the field and can hold back the pace of humanitarian work. Those unexploded weapons are also considered a major obstacle to the work of organizations removing rubble. On 16 February, one person was killed and four wounded by an unexploded ordnance in Beit Lahia. Pupils also discovered white phosphorus wedges in a school in Tal El Hawa. The UN stated that the inability to identify a suitable area to which ordnance can be demolished remains a major constraint, as also the inability to bring any of the materials and equipment needed to destroy or isolate the ordnance to Gaza. Psychological effects Shocked children who are bearing the brunt of violence of the military engagement in Gaza. Widespread panic was reported among student population, exacerbated by the attack timing during school hours. Classes were in session at the time of the IAF airstrikes, with some students sitting for midyear exams. Other students were either on their way to school for the afternoon shift, or returning home. Parents rushed to schools to collect their children. The United Nations has several times warned from the devastating effects of the attacks on children, who form 56% percent of the population, and who are bearing the brunt of violence and a significant proportion of the injured who are severely maimed. Schools are currently focusing on providing psychological and mental health support to the students, before resuming teaching core subjects. The head of Gaza's mental health program, has said that half of the population will suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the crisis. The UN states that according to reports by the consultancy company Near East Consulting, about 96 percent of Gaza residents feel depressed and disheartened. The highest level of depression is in North Gaza and Rafah, where 81 percent of the respondents do not feel secure about their households and family members. The World Health Organization estimates that 25,000 to 50,000 new people are likely to be in need of psychological intervention for longer term effects of the hostilities. Groups particularly at risk include separated children, people with pre-existing mental disabilities, pre-existing or new physical disabilities, elderly who have lost family support and female-headed households. A UNDP report on the aftermath of the Israeli military operation highlights that over 1 million of 1.4 million, 75% of the Gaza population, feel insecure and that although moust households have suffered from limited access to basics such as food, water, sanitation, and money, their highest need is personal security. =Energy= The only power plant in Gaza is not operational due to the lack of industrial fuel and spare parts. As of 1 January, power outages last 16 hours per day. Due to localised damage following the airstrikes, some electrical lines have been cut, causing some areas to suffer from power cuts lasting 24 hours. In addition, due to the damage caused by the air strikes to 15 electrical transformers, as many as 250,000 people in central and northern Gaza have no electricity supply during the entire day and night. On 1 January, a 5MW line from Egypt to Rafah was damaged, extending the power cuts to Rafah, which usually has a continuous supply. Fuel for heating and cooking are no longer available and most of the 240 gas stations in Gaza City have been closed. As of 4 January, there is almost total blackout in Gaza City, North Gaza, Middle Area and Khan Yunis. 90% of the telephone network, including both cellular service and land lines, is down, since it depends on backup generators with dwindling fuel stocks. Since the Israeli ground operation, 75% of Gaza's electricity has been cut off and the Palestinian technicians face difficulties reaching damaged lines because of the military attacks. As of 7 January, much of the population of the Gaza Strip continues to live without electricity. By 16 January, the twenty first day of the attacks, most households still do not have any electricity. As of 22 January, twenty five days after the beginnings of the attacks, 40 percent of the 1.5 million population remains without electricity. The remaining 60 percent receive only intermittent supply that can reach only 6 hours per day in the north of the Gaza strip. Spare parts and other equipments are a priority. After 8 days of the ceasefire, a month since the beginning of the attacks, the power plant is working on only one turbine, producing 30 MW instead of the daily full capacity of 80 MW cause of the lack of industrial fuel. By 29 January, the electricity situation has returned to its pre-27 December status, with much of the Gaza strip receiving only intermittent electricity. Certain areas are receiving very little power as a result or some low-voltage lines breakage. In order to meet demand throughout the territory, GEDCO (Gaza Electricity Distribution Co.) has put in place a power cut schedule where Gaza and North Gaza will face power cuts of eight hours three times a week; and the Middle Area and Khan Yunis will face power cuts of 6‚Äì8 hours twice per week. Those cuts does include unintentional power cuts. GEDCO estimates the damage to the electricity network due to the recent hostilities at over $10 million. Even before the conflict, its reserves of spare parts were close to depletion due to the 18-month blockade on Gaza. By 29 January 38 transformers essential for the repair of the electricity system are still waiting permission from the Israelis to be allowed into Gaza. Due to the lack of supplies, GEDCO continues to partially repair the network where possible. The UN warns that those ad-hoc partial repairs will increase technical losses by 25-30 percent, reduce the lifetime of network components, and further expose sections of the network to possible collapse. Since the cease-fire, Israel has allowed approximately 87 tonnes cooking gas per day, which is much less than the estimated need of 300 tonnes per day. No petrol or diesel has been allowed into Gaza since 2 November, except for UNRWA. No petrol, diesel or cooking gas was allowed by Israel into Gaza between 8 and 14 February. =Water= Since 5 November, there has been a shortage of chlorine for water treatment due to Israeli blockades, increasing the risk of outbreak of water diseases. On 27 December, Israeli airstrikes extensively damaged two water wells, rendering a population of 30,000 Palestinians without water. On 2 January, airstrikes in the al-Mughraqa area damaged a main drinking water pipe, cutting off water supplies to 30,000 people in the Nuseirat Camp. The UN sums the situation that as of 2 January, 250,000 people in Gaza City and northern Gaza are without water supply; seven water wells were seriously damaged and cannot be repaired due to bombardments. As of 4 January, and as reported by the Palestinian Coastal Municipality Water Utility (CMWU) throughout the UN reports, 70% of the Gaza strip 1.5 million population have no access to water, in particular in Gaza City and northern Gaza. As of 6 January, 800,000 Palestinians have no access to water, and those who still enjoy water access face problems in purifying such water as well as risking additional danger of contamination due to waste water leakage. This situation lasts in the third week of the attacks where 500,000 Palestinians still have no access to running water, another 500,000 receive water for four to six hours only every five to seven days, and the rest receive water for four to six hours every two or three days. Five days after the unilateral lull, one fifth of the Gaza strip 1.5 million population has no direct access to drinking water and currently depends on water purchased from private suppliers. As of 26, 8 January days after the unilateral ceasefire, at least 70% of the water system is functioning, although this does not mean that everyone is receiving water due to localized damage. By 5 February, a month and 8 days since the beginning of the Israeli attacks, the CMWU reports that 50 percent of Gaza's 1.5 million population receives running water for 6‚Äì8 hours every second day; 30 percent of the population receives running water every third day; and ten percent of the population receives water every five days. Ten percent of the population does not receive running water and depends on tankered water. As of 9 February, the CMWU reports that 50,000 people do not have access to water and an additional 150,000-200,000 receive water every 5 or 6 days. According to the World Health Organization guidelines, 80% of drinking water in Gaza is not currently safe for human consumption. In light of the poor quality of water, the Ministry of Health and the UNICEF has stated concerns about the increased risk of diarrhea and other water-borne diseases in infants. In a damage assessment carried by the CMWU, four water wells in Beit Hanoun, Gaza City, and Jabalia have been totally destroyed. Damage to several water carriers are widely reported. Preliminary findings shows that some Gaza areas like Al Atatra and Izbet Abd Raboo sustained 50 percent of their water networks damaged, while others have sustained a 30 to 35 percent damage to their networks. In total, 5,708 roof-top tanks were completely destroyed, and 2,985 were damaged. 2,204 solar heaters were destroyed and 1,762 were damaged. In some areas, the price of tankered water is as high as 175 Israeli new sheqel per metre cube. Several humanitarian organizations including Action Against Hunger, CARE, ICRC, Oxfam, and Unicef continue to provide drinking water to people in need, and also material and financial support to the CMWU for emergency repairs. Oxfam and Action Against Hunger report a short supply of water tanks for distributing water, which makes it difficult for them to cover all areas in need. The CMWU has created a list of prioritized elements items including pipes, generators, and pumps awaiting clearance by the Israeli authorities for entry into Gaza. The International Red Cross requested approval from the Israeli authorities for the entry of 36 trucks containing such repair material, but only 13 trucks were allowed. The PVC pipes that the Red Cross previously cleared were refused entry by the Israeli authorities. On 9 February, the UN states that the entry of needed spare parts into Gaza remains problematic, and as a consequence major repairs to Gaza's water network can not take place. =Sanitation= A satellite-based damage assessment of sewage treatment plant damage and outflow detection in Sheikh Ejlin. A single impact crater to the eastern section of a holding pond caused a massive outflow of sewage, moving an estimated total distance of 1.2km. United Nations (UNOSAT). March 2009 Since 31 December, sewage and water systems in Beit Hanoun were hit at five locations causing considerable damage to the main sewage pipeline leading to sewage water pouring into the streets. The sanitation system cannot treat the sewage and is dumping 40 million litres of raw sewage into the sea daily. On 3 January, The UN reported emerging fears that continued shelling near the Beit Lahiya sewage lagoon, which contains 3 million cubic metres of waste water, will cause a massive sewage overflow. In addition to agricultural areas, up to 15,000 people are directly at risk. As of 5 January, Gaza sewage system was on the verge of collapse due to the lack of power and fuel; sewage is flooding into Beit Lahya, farmland and the sea. As of 13 January, UNRWA was still unable to deliver fuel to water treatment plants to alleviate pressure on the banks of the Beit Lahiya lagoon. On 16 January, eyewitnesses report that a stream of sewage is flowing up to one kilometer from the Gaza City water treatment plant. Since 31 December and As of 19 January, a day after twenty-three days of the Israeli attacks, sewage continues to flow in the streets of Beit Lahya and Beit Hanoun, 30 cubic meters of sewage are flowing into the streets of Beit Hanoun every hour. By 29 January, following repairs, sewage is no longer leaking in the streets of Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun. In the CMWU damage assessment report, waste water networks in Gaza City, Beit Hanoun, Jabalia, and Beit Lahia have sustained severe damage. The Ash Sheikh 'Ijleen sewage plant which treats the raw sewage of an area inhabited by 400,000 people has been out of order since it was struck by a shell in the second week of the conflict. The final report of the damage assessment carried out by the CMWU reveals that repairing the water and wastewater network and facilities will cost approximately 6 million US dollars, including 830,000 dollars to repair the wastewater network. According to the Palestinian Hydrology Group, solid waste is accumulating in most areas affected by the hostilities, with the exception of Gaza city where only two areas face problems with solid waste. The group also reported that on 13 February, 3,000 litres of fuel had leaked into wastewater infiltration basin of the Beit Lahia emergency wastewater treatment plant, posing a risk for chemical contamination of the aquifer by hydrocarbons. Major repairs can not take place without the entry of needed spare parts into Gaza, which remains problematic. =Banknotes= The Israeli shekel is a widely used currency in the Gaza Strip, and the territory needs at least 400 million shekels, or about $100 million each month in new currency to replace aging notes and to pay salaries. Since 24 December, the ban on the entry of banknotes into Gaza has hampered several humanitarian programs run by the UNRWA, the largest humanitarian assistance provider in the Gaza Strip. Cash needs for the UNRWA included banknotes for distribution programs to 94,000 dependent \\"Special Hardship\\" families, for suppliers and contractors of critical programs including school feedings, as well as for its \\"cash for work\\" program. As of 18 January, the first day following the twenty-two days of attacks, cash has still not entered the strip and was urgently needed, including for the UNRWA activities. After the operation, cash was still urgently needed to reactivate the private sector and prevent increasing dependence on humanitarian aid. This lack of cash also prevented access to basic supplies including the limited stocks of food in the markets. By 5, 18 February days after the operation, cash still did not enter the strip except for a few international organizations. The UN Humanitarian Affairs office stated that a system must be urgently established that ensures the regular and predictable monthly transfer of the necessary cash. On 6 February, Israel allowed the transfer of 42 million US dollars from banks in the West Bank to the Gaza Strip. According to the Bank of Palestine, this money transfer will enable the Palestinian Authority to pay the salaries of its 70,000 Gaza based employees. Israel last allowed cash in mid-December 2008. Afterwards, the UN reported that more cash is needed for private sector reactivation and to prevent increasing dependence on aid. =Economic infrastructure= Extensive destruction was caused to commercial enterprises and to public infrastructure. According to Palestinian industrialists, 219 factories were destroyed or severely damaged during the Israeli military operation. Of the three per cent of industrial capacity that was still operating after the 18-month Israeli blockade, much has now been destroyed. The biggest Palestinian food-processing plant, Alweyda was devastated, as were both Abu Eida, the largest ready-mixed concrete producer, with four factories demolished, and the Al Badr flour mills, with the biggest storage facilities in the Strip. All three had close and long-standing contact with Israeli partner firms and suppliers. The owners stated that they see this as part of an economic war to make Gaza dependent on Israel. According to the World Food Programme, between 35-60 percent of the agriculture industry has been damaged by the Israeli military operation. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that 13,000 families who depend directly on farming, herding and fishing have suffered significant damage to their livelihoods. =Crossings and aid= :Further information: Humanitarian aid during the 2008‚Äì2009 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict Map of countries giving emergency aid to Gaza in 2009. There has been an extreme shortage of trucks entering the Gaza strip since the beginning of the conflict. In December 2005, an average of 631 trucks was entering Gaza strip on a daily basis. This figure has dropped to 475 trucks daily by May 2007, and by 27 December 2008, the first day of the attacks, Kerem Shalom has a daily average of 73 trucks entering the Gaza strip. The UN reports that international agencies have faced \\"unprecedented denial\\" of access to Gaza since 5 November. Humanitarian access remains unreliable and needs to be granted everyday without restriction. By 5 February, one month and 8 days after the beginning of Israeli attacks, the UN reported that the number of truckloads of aid permitted to enter Gaza daily by the Israeli authorities remains insufficient. John Holmes, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator has stated in his statement to the Security Council that after the end of the Israeli operation, and on \\"good days\\", only 120 truckloads gets into Gaza, instead of the normal daily requirement, including commercial traffic, of 500 trucks at minimum. Essential items such as construction materials, water pipes, electrical wires, and transformers continue to be effectively banned, or only allowed infrequently after \\"endless haggling\\", Holmes declared. He also added that commercial goods must be allowed in and out, since Gaza Palestinians \\"do not want or deserve to be dependent on humanitarian aid\\" and that the \\"limited trickle\\" of items into Gaza continue the effective collective punishment of the civilian population and force the counter-productive reliance on tunnels for daily essentials. The Gas Station Owners Association in Gaza reported a significant drop in the amount of fuel smuggled through the Gaza-Egyptian border since the beginning of February, largely due to the destruction of tunnels by Israel. The UN reports that sources in Rafah suggest a decrease in amount of merchandise being smuggled into Gaza through the tunnels due to the ongoing Israeli attacks. The UN reports that although the Israeli authorities have informed the humanitarian community that 150 trucks would be allowed into Gaza per day, capacity has not exceeded 120 truckloads. In addition, only a restricted list of items is being allowed into Gaza. As of the morning of 28 January, approximately 30 International NGO staff members were in Gaza, along with approximately 22 UN international staff members. There are outstanding requests for over 200 people to enter Gaza and this number is growing \\"by the day\\". The chair of the Association of International Development Agencies, which includes 75 humanitarian organizations has stated that \\"it is unacceptable that staff of international aid agencies with expertise in emergency response are still not given full access into Gaza, and that the crossings are not fully operational for humanitarian and commercial goods\\". Many NGOs have failed to receive a response from the Israeli authorities regarding their applications, while others were requested to provide additional information regarding their specific mandates, activities and funding sources. Others have been denied entry altogether. The UN reports that a key problem has been inconsistency in the application process; some staff members are informed that they have been approved, only to be denied entry when they attempt to cross Erez. In other cases, staff receive conflicting information from Israeli authorities regarding regulations that must be met before entry is allowed. The UN has described the Israeli procedures as inconsistent and unpredictable ones that impedes the ability of organizations to effectively plan their humanitarian response and obstructs efforts to address the humanitarian crisis. On 2 February, the UN reported that the number of truckloads of aid permitted to enter Gaza daily by the Israeli authorities remains insufficient, and humanitarian organizations continue to face serious restrictions to enter Gaza. On 16 February and on behalf of the humanitarian community, The Logistic Cluster was negotiating with the Israeli authorities regarding transport of goods into Gaza. A list of priority items for transport into the Gaza Strip, which was consolidated based on input from sector leads to reflect humanitarian needs in Gaza, is being used as the basis for negotiations with the Israeli authorities. United Nations Relief and Works Agency building shelled during the conflict On 7 January, Israel agreed to a three-hour humanitarian truce, allowing supplies and fuel into Gaza. The UN welcomed the move, but stated that round the clock assistance was required to meet the population humanitarian needs. The Human Rights Council expressed a similar position. The International Red Cross, United Nations and aid workers have reported intolerable conditions and a deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The Red Cross has accused the Israeli military of failing \\"to meet its obligation under international humanitarian law.\\" On 9 January, the UN resumed aid work, after receiving assurances from Israel that its workers will no longer be targeted. As of 14 January 2009, close to 900 trucks (including 20,000 tons of basic foods and medical supplies) have been delivered to Gaza.\\"Hamas raids aid trucks, sells supplies.\\" Jerusalem Post. 13 January 2009. 14 January 2009. Addressing the aid situation on 7 January, Save the Children stated that, \\"The small amount of aid allowed in, while better than nothing, is a pitiful gesture in the face of such an overwhelming humanitarian crisis,\\" noting that insufficient amounts of food, fuel and medical supplies were delivered. The UN has also stated that the aid delivered is insufficient to address the chronic humanitarian crisis given the \\"scale of the attacks\\". On 3 February, blankets and food parcels were confiscated by Hamas police personnel from an UNRWA distribution center, and on 4 February, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator demanded that the aid be returned immediately. The Hamas government issued a statement stating that the incident was a misunderstanding between the drivers of the trucks and has been resolved through direct contact with the UNRWA. On 9 February, UNRWA lifted the suspension on the movement of its humanitarian supplies into Gaza, after the Hamas authorities returned all of the aid supplies confiscated. Several countries have pledged aid after the offensive on Gaza began, promising financial support and humanitarian assistance (see map). Aid delivering international organizations include the European Union, UNRWA, the Red Cross, the Red Crescent, the Red Star of David, and the World Food Programme. Effects on Israel The Israeli Home Front Command issued detailed emergency instructions to Israeli citizens for preparing for and dealing with rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip. The instructions included orders to stay within a certain distance of bomb shelters based on proximity to the source of the rockets. Residents adjacent to the Gaza border were instructed to remain in fortified rooms.Home Front Command issues emergency instructions, Ynet 31 December 2008 Israelis ascribed their low civilian casualties to an orderly public response to these instructions.

Effects on foreigners At the start of the conflict, more than a thousand foreigners were living in or near Gaza, including nationals from several Western nations, most of them were Palestinian dual citizens and spouses of Palestinians. As of 8 January, diplomats estimated that some 400 foreign nationals from 22 countries remained in Gaza. Agencies assisting in the evacuation of foreigners, including the Red Cross, stated that their efforts were hampered by the violence, by bureaucratic obstacles and by lack of coordination between Israel, the United Nations and host countries. On 4 January, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was rushed into a bomb shelter as warning sirens sounded while he was visiting the Israeli city of Sderot.Griff Witte, In Southern Israel Residents Doubt That Rocket Fire Can Be Stopped , Washington Post 5 January 2009Dina Kraft, \\"In Israel, Bloomberg Shows His Support\\", New York Times 4 January 2009 On 8 January, in Gaza city, a Ukrainian woman and her child were killed, while her other child was injured.

Location  It is west of Wai and 32 km from Satara. Its coordinates are 18¬∞ 05' N, 74¬∞ 00' E. It has an elevation of above sea level.Satara District GazetteFriends of forts website  History  The builder of the fort is unknown. During Maratha times, Kamalgad, Pandavgad and other forts in the area were administered by a mokasaddar (manager) from Bijapur. Early documents written in now defunct Modi script of the Marathi language refer to the fort as 'Kattalgad'. A detailed study of these documents is underway. In April 1818, Kamalgad surrendered after resistance to a British detachment commanded by a Major Thatcher. Under the British, it was used to execute prisoners of war.Description of a Trek to Pandavgad  Major Features  Red ocher in Kamalgad fort The Map of Kamalgad Fort The fort covers a flat area, 3-4 acres in size. It is surrounded by steep rock and can only be reached by perilously scaling this rock. Earlier, the approach was by an artificial tunnel, which started at the base of the rock and emerged on the top. Now this tunnel is blocked by a big rock which fell into it and was never removed. There are no buildings on the top nor walls of any kind or even a gateway, which is unusual for a fort in this area. Likely, its height and steep rock around it provided it with enough protection. Places to see The only structure on the top is a hole which is the remains of a well sunk right through the rock, into the soil below which still has water. The hole is eighteen to twenty feet deep. The sides of the well which were formed of the natural rock were reported to have contained recesses in which criminals were placed. They had to choose between starvation and drowning. However, none of the recesses can be discerned today. Some reports indicate that this 'hole' might have been a quarry for red stone (geru) which is plentiful in this region (see picture). How to reach The nearest town is Bhor or Wai which is easily reachable from Pune. The base village of the fort is Tupewadi which is 30 km from Wai and 46 km from Bhor.There are good hotels at Bhor and Wai for stay and food. The trekking path starts from the hillock south of the Tupewadi. The route is very safe. It takes about 2 hours to reach the machi.The route is well covered with trees. The hill route ends upon an open land called Kamal machi.On the machi there is dense forest of Jambhul and Pisa trees. After reaching the machi the path takes a left turn to reach the lone villager's hut. The lone villager on the machi can make arrangements for night stay and food at very reasonable cost. The balekilla can be reached from Machi within 20mins.Balekilla is a scarp rising 30-40feet above the forest covered area.

It was completed in 1797 at a total cost of ¬£48,320 18s 10d. It is a Grade I listed building. Construction The aqueduct was designed by civil engineer John Rennie and constructed by architect Alexander Stevens (died 1796, aged 66).Fleury, p.30. On page 574 it is stated that his year of death was 1795. The cost of the construction was close to ¬£50,000.Fleury, p.116 The aqueduct is a traditional structure of that time, consisting of five stone arches supporting the stone trough. Within the piers, special volcanic pozzolana powder was imported to be mixed with cement, which allowed the concrete to set under water. Because of the rush to finish the initial stages, before the winter floods, the construction was carried out around the clock and the final bill for the project was over ¬£30,000 over budget (2.6 times the original estimate). This vast overspend was the reason that the Lancaster canal was never joined to the main canal network ‚Äì there wasn‚Äôt enough money for the planned aqueduct over the River Ribble at the southern end of the canal. Recent restoration Work began to restore the aqueduct in January 2011, and was completed in March 2012. The work involved restoring the canal channel, masonry repairs, removing graffiti, and improving public access. The project cost ¬£2.4m, and was funded by British Waterways, Lancaster Canal Trust, English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund.

The institute is located in the Pieter de la Court Building of Leiden University‚Äôs Faculty of Social Sciences. Research The research of the Afrika-Studiecentrum Leiden covers four themes: politics and security, society, religion and culture, and economics and history. Various projects study international relations of African countries with the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) and the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, economic development and entrepreneurship, and processes in African politics and legislation. Other areas of research are language use in social movements in Africa, new developments in healthcare through telecommunications and e-health (electronic health), natural conservation and African historiography. The Afrika- Studiecentrum publishes scientific articles and various books about its research, in-house or in collaboration with publishers such as Brill, including the Africa Yearbook and the series African Dynamics, the African Studies Collection, and the Africa Study Center Series. The topics range from international migration to social aspects of football in Africa. Most books also appear in an electronic (online) version.

Over the years, many well-known Dutch Africanists have worked at the African Studies Centre, including the poet Vernie February, the activist Klaas de Jonge, the sociologist Robert Buijtenhuijs and the law professor and film director Emile van Rouveroy van Nieuwaal. Legal scholar Hans Holleman served as a director from 1963 to 1969. Barbara Harrell-Bond worked at the Centre in the 1970s. Kofi Abrefa Busia, who later became prime minister of Ghana, worked at the African Studies Centre between 1959 and 1962. Former director Stephen Ellis was editor in chief of Africa Confidential. Petrus Johannes Idenburg, lector of African constitutional law at Leiden University, was one of the founders of the Centre. The Centre was one of the founders of AEGIS, a network of African Studies Centres in Europe that was set up in 1991 to build upon the resources and research potential available within Africanist institutions in Europe.

He was capped seven times for Wales and was part of the Welsh team that faced the touring 1924 New Zealand team. Rugby career Pugh was first selected to represent Wales in the opening match of the 1924 Five Nations Championship. Played at home at St Helen's, Wales faced England, who had finished the previous season as home nations Grand Slam winners. Under the captaincy of Joe Rees, Pugh was one of nine new Welsh caps in the team who would eventually lost 17-9 to England. Pugh was reselected for the next game of the tournament, away to Scotland, but this was an even worse result than the English game, with the Welsh team letting in eight tries. Six of the Wales team never played for the national team after this match, though the selectors kept faith in Pugh for the next match against Ireland. After Jack Whitfield's lone spell as captain in the Scotland game, the Welsh were now led by Rowe Harding, though the result remained the same. In a close game at the Cardiff Arms Park, Pugh scored his only international points when he scored one of two Welsh tries, though this was not enough to gain victory over the Irish team. In the final game of the tournament, Pugh found himself again selected, the only forward to have played in all four matches of the Championship.Smith (1980), pg 204. Towards the end of 1924, Pugh was part of the Welsh squad who faced George Nepia's touring New Zealand team.

There have been further launches of IPWP held in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea hosted by Powes Parkop in September 2009, and in the European Parliament in Brussels hosted by Caroline Lucas MEP in January 2010. IPWP was set up by exiled West Papuan independence advocate Benny Wenda, and is chaired by the British Labour Party MP Andrew Smith and Lord Harries. Smith is also the Chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group for West Papua. The main goal of IPWP is to develop international parliamentary support and awareness for the West Papuan independence movement. The IPWP takes as its model a similar group that helped lead the independence movement of East Timor. By 2009, the IPWP included fifty parliamentarians from countries including Papua New Guinea, Australia, Sweden, New Zealand, Vanuatu, the Czech Republic, and the United Kingdom. In February 2012, the Australian government officially distanced itself from an IPWP meeting that took place in Canberra, stating that it remained \\"fully committed to Indonesia's territorial integrity and national unity\\". As of 2020, there are approximately 80 current parliamentarians listed as signatories from countries across five continents.  International Lawyers for West Papua  Plans were also announced to set up another body called International Lawyers for West Papua (ILWP), to work in unison with IPWP, and develop and co-ordinate support within the legal sector for West Papuan self-determination.

It was part of the Schutzmannschaft (Shuma), native police forces organized by the Germans in occupied territories and subordinated to the Order Police (Ordnungspolizei; Orpo). Some units of the Latvian auxiliary police were involved in the Holocaust. One of its units, the Arajs Kommando, was notorious for killing 26,000 civilians during the war, mostly Jews, but also Communists and Romas.Michael Mann, The dark side of democracy: explaining ethnic cleansing. Cambridge University Press, 2005. . p. 283 In addition to regular stationary police (patrolmen in cities and towns), 30 Police Battalions were formed. These mobile groups carried out guard duties of strategic objects or building fortifications, participated in anti-partisan operations and fought on the Eastern Front.  Formation of units  The auxiliary police force consisted primarily of those who had served in Latvian police, army, and militia organization which had been disbanded upon the prior Soviet occupation in 1940. Within the first week of the German occupation, Franz Walter Stahlecker, the leader of Einsatzgruppe A, tasked Lt. Colonel VoldemƒÅrs Veiss with organizing a police force to operate under the command of the SS. One of the earliest units formed was in Daugavpils, which German forces reached on June 28, 1941, six days after launching the Operation Barbarossa. Roberts Bl≈´zmanis was appointed chief of the Latvian Auxiliary Police in Nazi-occupied Daugavpils.Jacob Gorfinkel, Daugavpils (Dvinsk) Ghetto List ‚Äì 05-December-1941 An auxiliary police force was in Riga under Nazi auspices on July 3, 1941, headed by Latvian captain, Pƒìtersons. According to a German report of July 16, 1941, the auxiliary police force consisted of 240 men in six police districts with some members assigned to Kriminalpolizei (KriPo) and Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo) work.SS Einsatzgruppen: Nazi Death Squads, 1939‚Äì1945 by Gerry van Tonder, p. 70 The Latvian auxiliary police were usually tasked with the arrest of Jews as well as the digging of pits for their graves. One of the most infamous of these executions was the LiepƒÅja massacres of December 12, 1941. Here, as in the case of small towns, the Latvian auxiliary police was directly involved, participating in the arrest of Jews and contributing one firing squad at ≈†ƒ∑ƒìde. The first police battalion (1st Schutzmannschaft Battalion Riga, later 16th Police Battalion Zemgale) was formed in September 1941 and sent to the Eastern Front on October 21. The second of the Latvian police battalions to be sent outside Latvia left for Belarus on December 28, 1941 (numbered 17th by the Germans). The third (the 21st) was sent to the front at Leningrad on March 30, 1942, but at first underwent training and built fortifications there. It was actually placed in the front line in July. The front around Leningrad was held not only by Germans and Finns, but also by Norwegians, Dutch, Belgians, Lithuanians, Estonians, and the Spanish Blue Division. Shortly the 21st Battalion was joined by another Latvian battalion whose commander Captain Praudi≈Ü≈° was soon arrested for anti-German remarks, sentenced to death by a German military court, but was saved by the vigorous protests from the Latvian Self- Administration. Praudi≈Ü≈° was stripped of his rank and returned to the front as a soldier. However, eventually he regained his rank and as a Major commanded a Latvian regiment in Courland in 1945 and received several high German decorations. According to The Guardian, > \\"By 1943 there were two Latvian SS divisions and around 100,000 Latvians > were in German uniform, either in auxiliary police units or in the SS > legion.

In February-March of 1943, eight Latvian battalions took part in the punitive anti-partisan Operation Winterzauber near the Belarus‚ÄìLatvia border which resulted in 439 burnt down villages, 10,000 to 12,000 deaths, over 7,000 taken for forced labor or imprisoned at the Salaspils concentration camp. By 1943, there were 29 Latvian police battalions scattered all over the German-occupied Soviet Union from Leningrad to Crimea. For example, the 17th Battalion fought at Kharkov, the 23rd in Crimea. By 1944, the occupation power, with the collaboration of the Latvian Self-Administration, had formed a total of 33 auxiliary police battalions. =Relations with Germans= The Police Battalions were poorly armed. Therefore, they sometimes even had to steal automatic weapons from German supply depots. To improve the firepower of the 26th Battalion, corporal ≈Ωanis Butkus dug up weapons which he had captured as a leader of a group of national partisans in June and July 1941 and which he had hidden from the Germans. Not all of the service was on the front lines, and the actions in the rear frequently brought Latvians and Germans into conflict. The Latvians had no desire to fight against national partisans (Poles, Ukrainians, etc.) who were against both Germans and the Soviets. For example, the Latvian battalions stationed for a while near Vilnius established secret communications with the Polish partisans and agreed not to attack each other (when the Poles mistook a Latvian company for Germans and did attack them, they later sent an apology). A battalion on the other side of the former Latvian-Polish border prevented the German SD from collecting and sending Polish women to Germany in September 1943.Mangulis, V. Latvia in the Wars of the 20th Century. CHAPTER IX JULY 1941 TO MAY 8, 1945 . Historia.lv. =Restructuring= In 1942, the 19th and 21st Latvian Police Battalions were attached to the 2nd SS Infantry Brigade. The brigade was an international formation that included Dutch, Flemish and Norwegian volunteer Legions. Impressed by the conduct of the Latvian battalions, Heinrich Himmler changed the 2nd SS Infantry Brigade into a Latvian Brigade and at the same time set the foundations for a Latvian Division. The existing 18th, 24th, and 26th Latvian Police Battalions serving in the Leningrad front were used to form the Brigade's 2nd SS Volunteer Regiment. They were then sent for training at Krasnoye Selo, where Himmler added the 16th Latvian Police Battalion to the brigade in February. On 18 May 1943, these Latvian Battalions along with the other three Latvian Legion Battalions were incorporated into the 2nd SS Infantry Brigade, and re- designated the 2nd SS Latvian Brigade (later 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian)).Lumans, Valdis O. (2006). Latvia in World War II. Published by Fordham Univ Press. p. 286 On August 1, 1943 four battalions (278th Sigulda, 278th Dobele, 276th Kuldƒ´ga and 312th) were incorporated in 1st Police Regiment Riga (Lettisches Freiwilligen Polizei Regiment 1 Riga). In February 1944, two more regiments were formed ‚Äì 2nd LiepƒÅja (from 22nd Daugava, 25th Abava, 313th and 316th battalions) and 3rd Cƒìsis (from 317th, 318th and 321st battalions). From July 1944, all three regiments where involved in battles near Daugavpils where they suffered heavy casualties. Six battalions (20th, 23rd, 267th, 269th, 322th and 271st) continued their fight in the Courland Pocket until capitulation. = List of battalions and regiments = *Polizei z. b. V.

It was printed by the Britons Matthew Gallagher and James Lamb, who had brought a printing press from Trinidad. They became the first typographers working in Venezuela. The newspaper published news and ideas favorable toward the current government, which would subject it to rapid changes in editorial policies as the Venezuelan War of Independence raged; its sympathies alternated between royalist and republican, somewhat undermining its credibility.

A game of Small World being played. Small World is a board game designed by Philippe Keyaerts, Illustrated by Miguel Coimbra and Cyrille Daujean as graphic designer, and published by Days of Wonder in 2009. The game is a reworking of Keyaerts' 1999 game Vinci. Small World has won several awards, including Games magazine 2010 Game of the Year. Game play Each player begins the game by selecting one of several available fantasy races that are created randomly. Each race is defined by two interlocking tiles, one giving a noun describing the race (e.g., \\"Elves\\") and the other an adjective (e.g., \\"Flying\\"), describing an additional special ability or special scoring opportunity. Numbers printed on the tiles also show how many race tokens the player may draw when playing that race. The player then makes use of the race tokens to capture territory on one of four different playing maps. Map selection is determined by the number of players with a specific map used for 2, 3, 4, or 5 players. To capture a territory, a player must place a particular number of tokens in it, based on the location of the territory, the number of defending tokens, and any special abilities of the player's race. If the player can place a sufficient number of tokens, the capture is guaranteed to succeed; if they cannot, the move is illegal. If enemy tokens are defeated in a captured territory, one of them is removed from the game entirely and the remainder are returned to the owning player to redeploy in their other territories. At the end of each turn, a player scores points based on the number of territories they own, with some racial abilities providing bonuses. Most territory captures are dieless; however, a player who is left at the end of their turn holding a number of tokens insufficient to capture a particular territory may attempt to capture it using a special die called the reinforcement die. After playing all the tokens into the target territory, they roll this customized, six-sided reinforcement die which increases the strength of their capture by the number rolled (0‚Äì3 units). If this total is still insufficient to capture the territory, the tokens are returned to the player's other currently owned territories and the player's turn ends; they cannot be redeployed to capture another territory, even if they would have been sufficient to do so. Since the number of tokens in a race is (usually) fixed, and can only go down as other races capture territories, eventually a race will reach a maximum number of territories that it can support. When this occurs, the player owning that race can declare that it is going into decline. This allows the player to select a new race to bring onto the board while the tokens of the former race remain in place, no longer movable, but continuing to gather points until their territories are captured. The game continues until a certain number of turns are completed, whereupon the player with the highest score wins. History Small World Philippe Keyaerts developed Small World from his earlier board game, Vinci. Small World has a new theme, the addition of dice, and separate race and powers pools. Days of Wonder announced the game by releasing one race picture every day from January 12 to 19, 2009. Additional announcements came on January 19 and 26. Small World was released in March 2009 in English, German and French editions. Dutch, Spanish and Japanese editions followed in June 2009. Small World has also been released on iOS for iPad and Android. There are many games like Small World that have come out or have yet to come out such as Risk or Rivals of the Dark Age. Computer games =Small World for iPad= In 2010, Days of Wonder released a touch-based digital version of the basic game for two players. It was their first tablet adaptation of a tabletop board game, and the first contemporary board game to be adapted digitally for iOS. =Small World 2= Days of Wonder has also released a crowd-funded update to the game, entitled Small World 2, for Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X, Linux, and Android, as well as iOS. Updated features included five-player games, multiple new play modes, and the expanded list of platforms. Additional expansions introducing elements including new races and powers are available as purchasable enhancements to the game. Expansions Small World has had several expansions. Some add new races and special powers (Cursed!, Grand Dames of Small World, Be Not Afraid...). Royal Bonus was originally only available to Kickstarter backers of the digital version of the game, but is now available to everyone. Some expansions add new mechanics or gameplay elements (Leaders of Small World, Necromancer Island, Tales and Legends). There is a standalone expansion, Small World Underground, that introduces a new set of maps with different region types and rules, including new Righteous Relics and Popular Places that give bonuses to the player that controls them, in addition to many new races and special powers. Small World Realms comes with hexagonal pieces to allow players to make their own gameboards, and tunnel tokens used to connect the original Small World maps to Small World Underground maps (originally released as a separate expansion). The latest expansion includes a 6-player map with the Original Small World on one side, and Underground on the other. It also has rules for team play, and new Righteous Relics and Popular Places designed to be used in team play. The Small World Designer Edition, a special version with tokens printed on wooden blocks, pewter miniatures for the terrain features, and all of the official expansions included, was available initially to Kickstarter backers of the second digital version of the game and later made available to the general public.  Reception  The game has generally received positive reviews with Broken Meeple saying \\"solid and will appeal to fantasy fans\\". RPG.NET have praised the game by saying that \\"one of the best war games you're going to find in a 90-minute package\\" and BGL have described it as \\"one of the best fantasy board games around that can be played under 1.5 hours\\".

Represented were 33 sports, 43 disciplines and 362 events, including 4 winter sports which were held in Shenyang, Changchun and Qingdao between January and April 2009. In all, a total of 1241 medals were awarded. The host province of Shandong came first on the medals table with 63 gold, 40 silver and 43 bronze. The games saw the triumphant return from injury for Olympic 110m hurdles champion Liu Xiang. Swimmer Liu Zige also broke the world record in the women's 200 metres butterfly, taking 2 seconds off from the previous record. The 11th National Games was labelled by some as \\"China's Olympics\\", which is reflective of growing significance of the National Games in China. Background Following the 9th National Games in 2001, officials decided to scrap the decades-old convention of rotating the host duties between Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong. The State Council of the People's Republic of China, decided that a bidding process would decide the host and any province, municipality and autonomous region was eligible to apply. In 2005, Shandong won the right to host the 11th National Games being the only applicant province with the permission of State Council of the People's Republic of China and the State General Administration of Sports. Development and preparation Shandong Airlines Boeing 737-800 in a livery promoting the Games. =Marketing= The logo for the games was designed to embody the concept of \\"Harmonious China, Energetic Shandong\\" (ÂíåË∞ê‰∏≠Âçé, Ê¥ªÂäõÂ±±‰∏ú). The logo is derived from the geometric patterns on artifacts of the Warring States period and the Western Han Dynasty unearthed in Jinan, Shandong. This represents the traditional folk culture of Shandong. The logo also depicts an abstract image of 11 athletes in motion which symbolises the 11th National Games. It is composed of the colours red, black, yellow, green and blue which are the colours of the Olympic rings and refer to the success of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. The final logo was selected from 3040 entries in a public competition launched in 2007 across mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. The mascot for the games was a cartoon character called \\"Taishan Boy\\" (Ê≥∞Â±±Á´•Â≠ê). It alludes the majestic stone of the Shandong's Mount Taishan. The mascot, dressed in a red shirt and white shorts, is an athletic figure giving the thumbs-up. According to the designer said, the character symbolizes \\"the spirit of life\\", \\"health and longevity\\" and \\"the enthusiasm and fighting spirit of the host\\". =Broadcasting= The 11th National Games were broadcast both on CCTV-1 and CCTV-5, as well as on the local Shandong Television station. Torch relay The torch of the 12th National Games, first unveiled on April 28, 2009, is based on the concept of ruyi (Â¶ÇÊÑè), a traditional Chinese ceremonial scepter. The torch is 69 cm long. It is designed to resemble the ruyi with gold and silver being the colour theme. At the top, the golden willow pattern is combined with the grey ruyi stripes. The mouth of the torch is shaped like the lotus, which is the city flower of Jinan. Also, the main venue for the games, the Jinan Olympic Sports Center, is also known as Donghe Xiliu (East Willow, West Lotus) due to its distinctive architecture. Mirroring the 2008 Olympic Games, a torch relay began on August 1, 2009 at Mount Taishan, a cultural site with a tradition of spiritual pilgrimages. The flame was lit in a sun ray ceremony by Beijing Olympics gold medalists archer Zhang Juanjuan and diver Wang Feng. On August 16, the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Wu Bangguo received the torch at the Great Hall of the People which officially marked the start of the relay. The torch was then carried on a two-month relay around the China, including through the major centres of Shandong.

He was also the Minister for Environment and Natural Resources of the Dominican Republic. Dr. Fern√°ndez is an agronomist, doctor and politician.  Biography  = First stage = Jaime David Fernandez Mirabal was born on October 15, 1956 in Ojo de Agua, Salcedo, today called Hermanas Mirabal Province. He is the son of Jaime Fernandez Camilo and Ded√© Mirabal Reyes, and the nephew of heroines Patria, Minerva, and Mar√≠a Teresa Mirabal, who were brutally assassinated during the Trujillo dictatorship on November 25, 1960, the date which was declared as the International Day of Non-Violence Against Women. This date is recognized by many countries, especially the United States of America. Dr. Fern√°ndez is the brother of Jaime Enrique Fernandez Mirabal and Jaime Rafael Fernandez Mirabal. His mother, Dede, took responsibility for raising her sisters' 6 children: Nelson Gonzalez Mirabal, Noris Gonzalez Mirabal and Raul Gonzalez Mirabal Mirabal (first son, daughter and second son of Patria); Minerva Tav√°rez Mirabal and Manolo Tav√°rez Mirabal (daughter and son of Minerva) and Jacqueline Guzman Mirabal (daughter of Maria Teresa). Fernandez married Lissy Campos in 1988; they have three children, Adriana Fernandez Campos, Ant√≥n David Fernandez Campos and Carmen Adela Fernandez Campos. = Studies and interests = Fernandez completed his primary and secondary education in Salcedo, later attending the Instituto Superior de Agricultura (English: Higher Institute of Agriculture) (ISA), studying agronomy. After graduating with his bachelor's degree he moved to Santo Domingo, where he studied medicine at the Instituto Tecnologico de Santo Domingo (INTEC). After this, Hernandez moved to Spain where he specialized in mental health at the Complutense University of Madrid. After various travels through Italy, Germany and Greece where he helped treat many patients in these countries, he undertook further study in social medicine. During his career as a doctor, Fernandez has worked in Cambita Garabitos in San Cristobal, Rancho Espa√±ol and Las Galeras, Samana in the Clinic Rural Montellano Salcedo Hospital, both located in Salcedo. Fernandez speaks several languages, including his native Spanish, English, Italian, and French. He also has non- speaking knowledge of German, Portuguese and Greek. According to some media, Fernandez has always been interested in sports. From the age of 13 he decided to organize athletic competitions in his hometown, Ojo de Agua, Salcedo, in memory of his aunts the Mirabal Sisters. He went on to create a sports and recreation club called the Mirabal Sisters Cultural and Sports Club, which sought to promote the organization and training of youth culture across the province. Fernandez was an active player in several sports, particularly football. At the same time he also showed some artistic skills in science, becoming a member of the drama and poetry of community in his hometown. He has also served as president of the Union Sports Salcedo Province and director of several national sports federations. Fernandez has also demonstrated his interests in education, becoming a member of the Society of Parents and Friends of the School, and serving as an important part of the Committee on Rural Health Clinic. He has also participated in the training of farmers' associations and mothers' clubs, with a single, clear objective of promoting good moral values, and providing educational and recreational services throughout the country. = Start in politics and vice presidency = Fernandez admired and followed the doctrine and ideology of Professor Juan Bosch, becoming convinced that to better promote social welfare activities, he had to go into politics. He then decided to join the ranks of the new Dominican Liberation Party (PLD) political party in 1973. Since the party's inception Fernandez devoted himself to further party integration and the search for new supporters for the PLD, proposing the integration of new party members in the Province of Salcedo. He also campaigned on the party's behalf for three years in Madrid, Spain. In 1990, he was nominated by his fellow party sympathizers for the candidacy of senator of Salcedo province. The campaign was successful and led to him becoming the first PLD senator of Salcedo. In his new position in the Senate, he began extensive work within the concentration of different political forces. During the government of Dr. Joaqu√≠n Balaguer, he helped to create a Provincial Development Program, which was recognized both nationally and internationally, especially in the areas of health, education, drinking water, and loans for women-run businesses. The efforts of Senator Fernandez, along with that of the Provincial Planning Office, the Provincial Office for Women, the Provincial Office of Information and Statistics (OPIE), and the Legal Center for Women, led to the implementation of a program to protect women's rights and fight domestic violence, continuing the legacy of his aunts, the Mirabal Sisters. In 1994, Fernandez ran again for office, and was reelected to the Senate. In 1996, Professor Juan Bosch declined to run for the presidency. Eventual presidential nominee Dr. Leonel Fern√°ndez Reyna suggested that Fernandez consider becoming vice president. Fernandez was immediately nominated by the PLD for Vice President of the Republic. He became the first Vice President representing both the PLD and Ojo de Agua, Salcedo. He was later appointed by President Fern√°ndez, during his 3rd presidential term, as Secretary of State for Environment and Natural Resources.

The first single off Circular was \\"Una Vida Contigo\\" (Spanish for A Life with You). = Circular: C√≥mo Girar Sin Dar La Vuelta = Due to the poor sales of the album, Vega went back to the studio and reworked the songs on her second effort, and also recorded two new songs: \\"Y Llueve\\" (Spanish for And It Rains) and \\"Clave De Sol\\". Both songs, along with the reworked versions of Circular, were then released as \\"Circular: C√≥mo Girar Sin Dar La Vuelta\\" (Circular: How To Spin Without Turning Around) on March 26, 2007. After releasing \\"Y Llueve\\" as the second single, both Vega and the label gave up promotion for the album, and she went on to concentrate on her future projects.

History of the work The brief but eloquent Lento for Strings was written in 1985, while the composer was in Australia. The work was commissioned by the Royal Melbourne Philharmonic, who premi√®red it in the autumn of that year in Melbourne, and Williamson chose to dedicate the piece to a longtime friend and champion, Paul McDermott. McDermott was held in particularly high regard by Williamson, especially as it was he who had successfully conducted his Symphony No. 6: Liturgy of Homage a few years before. Structure Firmly rooted in the key of F major, the stately theme is first played by the violins. After a short development section, the key changes to the relative major (D major, in this case) in a grand restatement of the original theme. The music returns to the opening key for the coda, where echoes of the theme are heard in the violas, with the slight harmonic alteration of the flatted sixth of the scale (D flat, in this case), a colouration which adds a certain poignancy to the final bars. Orchestration The Lento is scored for orchestral strings only, playing divisi most of the time. Recordings There are currently three recordings of the Lento available commercially. These are: *CHANDOS: Iceland Symphony Orchestra conducted by Rumon Gamba. (CHAN 1046) *CRESSIDIA CLASSICS: London Schubert Players, conducted by Alan Tongue.

Originally, Fusion Garage was working with Michael Arrington to release it as the CrunchPad, but in November 2009 Fusion Garage informed Arrington it would be selling the product alone. Arrington has responded by filing a lawsuit against Fusion Garage. History =Crunchpad= The CrunchPad project was started by Michael Arrington in July 2008, initially aiming for a US$200 tablet, and showed a first prototype (Prototype A) a month later. Beginning 2009, working Prototype B was introduced by the TechCrunch team led by Louis Monier, based on a 12 inch LCD screen, a VIA Nano CPU, Ubuntu Linux and a custom Webkit-based browser. The device was rapidly prototyped by DynaceptDynacept and a customized version of the Ubuntu distribution was compiled by Fusion Garage. After announcing Prototype B, there arose a desire for the tablet to come into production. Louis Monier worked closely with Fusion Garage as the team's lead designer. * April 9, 2009 - Prototype C is shown, looking very much like the original concept pictures. Michael Arrington wrote that the hardware, software and industrial design improvements seen in Prototype C were all driven by Fusion Garage. \\"... one thing I‚Äôve learned about hardware in the last year is that you need partners to actually make things happen, and the credit for what we saw today goes entirely to the Fusion Garage team.\\", he said. * June 3, 2009 - near-final industrial design * November 17, 2009 - Fusion Garage CEO Chandra Rathakrishnan emails Techcrunch, and informs them \\"out of the blue\\" that Fusion Garage's investors want to pull out of the partnership, and that they are under the impression that Techcrunch does not own rights to the project, but are simply helping advertise it.CrunchPad Litigation Imminent ‚Äì by Michael Arrington, techcrunch.com, December 4, 2009 Initially in 2008, $200 was mentioned as the target price-point. In the first half of 2009, $300 was mentioned as more likely. By the end of July 2009, news stories said the actual price when it would ship in November 2009 would be about $400, putting it in potential competition with netbooks and low-end laptops. The project generated some press and was mentioned in Washington Post and other media. Linux tablet emerges from blogosphere - News - Linux for Devices. Archive.is (2009-01-20). Retrieved on 2013-12-09. In July 2009, it was reported that Arrington founded a company of 14 employees around the tablet (Crunchpad Inc.) in Singapore, and that there would be a public presentation of a finished product later in the month. By late September 2009, the lack of publicity on the CrunchPad led Dan Frommer of The Business Insider to ask, in an article headline, \\"Where's The CrunchPad?\\" Apple and Microsoft were rumored to be working on new tablet computers, receiving more media coverage. In early October 2009, Popular Mechanics magazine recognized the CrunchPad with an award as one of the top 10 Most Brilliant Products of 2009, \\"the top 10 most brilliant gadgets, tools and toys that you can buy in 2009.\\" Other organizations questioned the appropriateness of the award as the CrunchPad was not available for purchase at publication time. On the November 12, 2009, Gillmor Gang podcast, Michael Arrington announced the product is \\"steamrolling along\\", that rumors of high prices are untrue, and that the product will probably retail for US$300‚Äì400, likely subsidised by features that are sponsored but won't impact negatively on the user experience (similar to Firefox's search bar). On August 15, 2011, the successor to the JooJoo and a new smartphone were announced after a made-up company \\"TabCo\\" unveiled it was, in fact, Fusion Garage. The announcement included a tablet and smartphone named the Grid 10 (10.1 inch tablet) and The Grid 4 (4 inch smartphone), both running GridOS, a fork of the Android operating system. =Crunchpad manifesto= In the founding July 21, 2008, manifesto \\"We Want A Dead Simple Web Tablet For $200. Help Us Build It.\\" Michael Arrington wrote: No further commitments were made in 2009 about making the design open and public, which would make it easier to add additional features such as a standard keyboard connector and increased storage. =JooJoo= On November 30, 2009, Michael Arrington announced that the CrunchPad project was dead. Three days prior to the planned debut, Fusion Garage CEO Chandra Rathakrishnan had informed him Fusion Garage would be proceeding to sell the pad alone. Arrington claims the intellectual property shared between both companies, so the product could not proceed legally. He said his side \\"will almost certainly be filing multiple lawsuits against Fusion Garage, and possibly Chandra and his shareholders as individuals, shortly\\". On December 7, 2009 - Fusion Garage CEO Chandra Rathakrishnan announced that he is releasing what had been developed as the CrunchPad and which he is now calling the \\"JooJoo\\", and that it will be available for pre-sale December 11, 2009 for $499 USD. On December 10, 2009 Michael Arrington/Techcrunch filed a lawsuit against Fusion Garage in Federal court. On February 1, 2010, Fusion Garage CEO Chandrasekar Rathakrishnan announced that JooJoo pre-orders had increased following the debut of the Apple iPad, and that additional funding of $10 million had been obtained. He also announced that Fusion Garage was in the process of forming a partnership with a mobile phone manufacturer that would handle the production of the device. On February 3, 2010, Fusion Garage announced that the manufacturing of JooJoo tablets had begun as part of a new agreement with CSL Group. In exchange for absorbing manufacturing costs of the JooJoo, CSL Group would take a percentage of profits from the sale of the devices. CEO Chandrasekar Rathakrishnan stated that JooJoo shipments would reach customers by late February, and that the device would support Adobe Flash at launch. On February 26, 2010, Fusion Garage announced a manufacturing delay of the JooJoo tablet, citing an issue fine tuning the touch sensitivity of the capacitive screen. JooJoo tablets are now to ship out on March 25, 2010, and all pre-order customers are to be provided with a free accessory to compensate for the delay. On November 11, 2010, Fusion Garage announced that Joojoo tablet at its current iteration is at ‚Äúits end of life‚Äù and the company will be exploring several new platforms that will not have backward compatibility.The Joojoo is dead, but Fusion Garage plans new products.

Biography A native of Chelsea, Massachusetts, Whittaker played baseball at Somerville High School, where he was the winning pitcher in eight of the team's 15 victories in 1911. He then attended Worcester Academy and Tufts University. While at Tufts in 1914 and 1915, he played summer baseball for the Falmouth Cottage Club in what is now the Cape Cod Baseball League. One of the top pitchers in the league, he threw a no-hitter for Falmouth against Oak Bluffs in 1915. Whittaker played a key role in what has been called the \\"greatest college baseball battle ever waged,\\" a 1916 championship game between collegiate baseball powerhouses Tufts and Harvard. Whittaker's only major league appearance came for Baseball Hall of Fame manager Connie Mack's historically poor-performing 1916 Philadelphia club. Whittaker tossed the final two innings for the Athletics on July 6 at Shibe Park in Philadelphia's 9-4 loss to the Detroit Tigers, whose lineup featured Hall of Famer Ty Cobb. Upon graduation from Tufts, Whittaker pursued a career in dentistry. He died in 1965.

History Consolidation talks In 2007, representatives from Orion Community Unit School District 223 met with representatives of neighboring Cambridge and Sherrard, Illinois, school districts on separate occasions to discuss merger possibilities and consolidation study reports.http://orionschools.us/DistrictHtml/FeasibilityStudiesConsolidationInf.htm Based on the report's recommendations, if merger were to occur with Cambridge, the existing Orion High School building would be used as a high school for the new district. If merger were to occur with Sherrard, Orion High School students would attend the current Sherrard Junior and Senior High School building, and the current Orion High School building would become the middle school for Orion and Sherrard. A survey of students, parents, and teachers in all districts was also conducted with regard to Orion and Sherrard. Overall, 63% of both districts' respondents were against consolidation. Surveys were more favorable of an Orion‚ÄìCambridge consolidation than an Orion‚ÄìSherrard consolidation. Frequently quoted oppositions to the Orion‚ÄìSherrard consolidation included Orion's debt, the already large size of the Sherrard district, and the incompatibility of school cultures due to a historic interconference athletics rivalry.http://orionschools.us/DistrictHtml/Orion_SherrardSuvey/Orion_Sherrard_Survey02072008.pdf In 2009, district superintendent David Deets commented that the consolidation topic remained on the district's radar because of the economic challenges districts face. No formal conversations have been scheduled with any of the region's districts regarding consolidation. Before reorganization talks can even begin, feasibility studies must be completed, and then a committee of 10 would have to be formed to prepare a consolidation proposal. A public vote is required to authorize any proposal deemed acceptable by the districts involved. Deets acknowledged the process is long, there is much information to process, and that there are many other issues on the radar. While Orion's population and economy remain relatively stable due to a proximity to the Quad Cities no comment was made regarding the community's efforts to address new housing starts, business improvement districts, marketing campaigns, or other indicators that address the district's overall population, or the ratio to school age population.Feasibility Studies for Consolidation InformationOrion and Sherrard Consolidation Survey Results Summary References External links * Orion High School * Orion Community Unit School District 223 * Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas: Concepts, Components, and Population * Interactive Illinois Report Card * 2008 Illinois School Profile for Orion High School * 2008 Illinois School Report Card for Orion High School * Illinois High School Association * https://thescarletink.com/ Public high schools in Illinois Schools in Henry County, Illinois ","title":"Orion High School"},{"id":"21171155","text":"Churchville Presbyterian Church is a historic Presbyterian church located at Churchville, Harford County, Maryland.

The species is distributed through the tropical waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean from California in the north to Peru in the south, including several offshore islands. The species is best identified by its deep body and mostly unscaled breast, as well as other more detailed anatomical features. The species is known to grow to a maximum length of 101 cm and a weight of 19.7 kg. Disagreement on the status of the species has been significant in the scientific literature, with many claiming it to be conspecific with or subspecific to the Atlantic Caranx hippos (crevalle jack). The most recent review of the crevalle jacks strongly concluded it to be a separate species based on the development of hyperostosis and fin colouring. It is predominantly a schooling inshore species, inhabiting sandy and rocky substrates, although larger individuals are occasionally found living pelagically to depths of 350 m. The Pacific crevalle jack is a fast-swimming predator, taking a variety of fish, crustaceans, and other small invertebrates. Spawning is thought to occur year-round, although peaks occur during November and May. The Pacific crevalle jack is an important species to commercial fisheries, with data available from Colima in Mexico indicating it accounts for up to 15% of the entire yearly catch. Pacific crevalle jack are highly rated gamefish, taken by both bait and a variety of lures, but are considered relatively poor quality food. Taxonomy and naming The Pacific crevalle jack is classified within the genus Caranx, one of a number of groups known as the jacks or trevallies. Caranx itself is part of the larger jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, part of the order Carangiformes. The species is part of what William Smith-Vaniz and Kent Carpenter term the Caranx hippos species complex, a group of three closely related and anatomically similar species, which also includes Caranx hippos (Crevalle jack) and Caranx fischeri (Longfin crevalle jack). The species was first properly scientifically described by the British zoologist Albert G√ºnther in 1867 based on a specimen taken from Panama, which was designated to be the holotype. He named the species Caranx caninus, with the specific epithet meaning 'dog like'. Apart from disagreements pertaining to the possible conspecificity of the species with Caranx hippos, the taxonomy has been very stable, with not one independent redescription and naming. There has, however, been considerable debate in the past as to whether the Pacific crevalle jack is the same species as its Atlantic counterpart, Caranx hippos. To this end it has previously been referred to as C. hippos, and John Nichols argued it was a subspecies, creating the trinomial name Caranx hippos caninus. Yoshio Hiyama also referred the species to a subgenus he created; Tricropterus, creating the name Caranx (Tricropterus) hippos, which is now considered invalid. The most recent review of the species by Smith-Vaniz and Carpenter treated the fish as a separate species, citing differences in the development of hyperostosis and differing anal fin colours as evidence of different species. The species is commonly referred to as the 'Pacific crevalle jack' or 'Pacific jack crevalle' due to its close appearance to the Atlantic 'crevalle jack', as well as a variety of Spanish names. Distribution and habitat The Pacific crevalle jack inhabits the tropical to subtropical waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean. The species ranges along the western American coastline from Lobos de Tierra Island, Peru in the south and north to San Diego Bay, California. The species is generally rare north of the Gulf of California, however El Nino events which bring warm tropical waters further north than usual transport Pacific crevalle jack and other species beyond their normal range. All occurrences of the species in San Diego Bay have been attributed El Nino events in that year. The species is also known from several offshore Pacific islands including the Gal√°pagos, Malpelo, Cocos, and Revillagigedo Islands. The Pacific crevalle jack is most common in coastal regions, although is occasionally found in more pelagic settings, with the species not known to live deeper than 350 m. In coastal waters the species prefers sandy and rocky substrates, including protected bays, lagoons and harbours, where large schools of the species form. Larger individuals are often solitary, and living in deeper offshore environments. Pacific crevalle jack are also common in estuaries, usually as juveniles which preferentially inhabit these environments, but also as adults that make their way into brackish waters and tidal streams. Juveniles are known to penetrate well upstream, indicating a wide salinity tolerance. Description The Pacific crevalle jack is distinguished by yellow anal and caudal fins The Pacific crevalle jack is a relatively large fish, growing to a maximum recorded size of 101.6 cm in length and 19.7 kg in weight. It is similar to most other jacks of the genus Caranx, having a moderately deep and compressed, oblong body, with the dorsal profile more convex than the ventral profile, particularly anteriorly. The dorsal fin is in two distinct sections; the first consisting of eight spine and the second of one spine and 19 to 21 soft rays. The anal fin consists of two anteriorly detached spines followed by one spine and 16 to 17 soft rays. The pectoral fins are falcate, and consist of 19 to 21 soft rays, while the caudal fin is strongly forked. The species lateral line is moderately arched anteriorly, with 58 to 79 scales in this section, while the straight section contains none to seven scales and 34 to 43 strong scutes. The breast is devoid of scales with the exception of a small patch of scales in front of the pelvic fins. The species has well-developed adipose eyelids, while its dentition consists of an outer row of widely spaced canine teeth and an inner band of villiform teeth in the upper jaw, with a row of widely spaced conical teeth on the lower jaw. The Pacific crevalle jack has 21 to 27 gill rakers and 24 vertebrae. There are significant differences in the development of hyperostosis between this species and C. hippos. The Pacific crevalle jack is a bluish-green to bluish-black dorsally, fading to a silvery white or golden shade ventrally. Juveniles are generally lighter in colour, also possessing five dark vertical bars on their sides. The fins are all white dusky with the exception of the anal fin and lower caudal fin lobe, which are white to brownish orange, with the ventral surface of the caudal peduncle also this colour. This contrasts to the bright lemon yellow anal and lower caudal fins of C. hippos. The Pacific crevalle jack also has a black spot on the base of its pectoral fins, as well as a dark blotch on the margin of the operculum. Biology A Pacific crevalle jack taken by an angler off Baja California The Pacific crevalle jack is a schooling fish for much of its life, forming moderate to large aggregations that can move quite rapidly. Older fish tend to be more solitary, moving offshore to greater depths. It is one of the most abundant pelagic species throughout its range, making it both ecologically and economically important. The species is a strong, fast swimming predator that takes predominantly small fish, as well as crustaceans such as prawns and various other benthic invertebrates, although no detailed data on diet has been collected. Individuals begin reaching sexual maturity at 67 cm in males and 65 cm in females, with reproduction thought to occur year-round. There are peaks in spawning activity however, with these peaks reported as January‚ÄìFebruary and August in Colombia and May and November in Mexico. The eggs are pelagic, as are the newly hatched larvae. Several studies on yearly growth in the species have given slightly different results, although the maximum difference between these studies is 5 cm per year. After the first year, the species is 19.02 to 20.64 cm long, after the second it is 29.86 to 32.95 cm, and it is 36.8 to 42.44 cm long after the third year. According to the von Bertalanffy growth equations that govern the species growth, the species may live as long as 12 or 15 years, or even 37 years as calculated in one study. These growth equations are generated using the fish's otoliths, which add annual growth rings. These also show yearly periods of slow and fast growth, with August to February having the fastest growth due to the rainy season providing increased runoff and nutrients to the coast. Slowest growth occurs during March to August, although one of the main spawning peaks occurs during this period. Relationship to humans A Pacific crevalle jack caught by the French angler David Mailland with a lure in Samara area, Guanacaste, Costa-Rica The Pacific crevalle jack is of high importance to fisheries throughout its range, with the abundance of the species allowing for large catches by commercial fishermen. Due to the artisanal nature of many Central American fisheries, detailed catch statistics of the species are not kept, making it impossible to estimate total annual catches. Where these statistics are kept, however, it is apparent that it is one of the most important species in its range, with the species accounting for up to 15% of the total annual catch in Colima, Mexico. This translates as around 76 tonnes on average, just for the state of Colima. The species is taken year round by a variety of methods including trawling, fence and fixed nets, as well as hook and line methods. It is sold at market either fresh, frozen, smoked, salted or dried, and is also utilized as a source of fishmeal and oil. Despite the large numbers taken, the Pacific crevalle jack is considered a second or third class commercial product, fetching fairly low prices at market. The value of the fish does change throughout its range based on local opinion of the fish. The Pacific crevalle jack is also a major target for anglers throughout its range, and can be taken by live bait as well as various lure types including surface poppers and fast retrieved metal slugs and spoons. It is generally viewed as marginal table fair, although bleeding the fish immediately after capture is said to improve the flavor. The IGFA maintains full line class and tipped world records for the Pacific crevalle jack, the current all tackle world record sits at 17.69 kg (39 lb 0oz) caught off Playa Zancudo, Costa Rica in 1997.

Farrell (December 26, 1863 - October 17, 1933) was professional track athlete, circus performer and track coach. Farrell was a professional foot-racer in the 1880s and 1890s, beginning as a competitor in the hook, hose and ladder teams of New England. He was the first American to win England's Sheffield Cup on two occasions and competed in races from 100 yards to one mile. He became known as \\"the greatest professional footracer this country has ever known.\\" Seeking out new challenges, Farrell performed with the Barnum & Bailey Circus for several years racing against a horse, and he was never known to ever lose to the horse.(Farrell proudly noted that, in several years of racing horses with the circus, \\"he was beaten only half a dozen times by the horse during the years\\" .) Farrell later became a track coach at Yale University, the University of Maine, Ohio State University, and the University of Michigan. He coached at Michigan for 18 years and developed many great athletes, including DeHart Hubbard and Eddie Tolan. Biography He was born on December 26, 1863 in Rockville, Connecticut to Matthew Farrell. Professional foot-racer =The greatest professional foot-racer in America= Farrell grew up at a time when professional foot-racing was one of the most popular sports in New England, attracting as much attention as football would in the 20th Century. Farrell gained fame as one of the world's foremost professional runners in the 1880s and 1890s. Sports writer Walter Eckersall called Farrell \\"the greatest professional footracer this country has ever known.\\" It was said that Farrell \\"could run any race from the hundred to the mile.\\" In his day, he was considered by his opponents \\"the best money racer who ever pulled on a running shoe.\\" Harry Gill, who later became the track coach at the University of Illinois, competed against Farrell and said he had never seen Farrell's equal. =Hook, hose and ladder events= Farrell got his start competing in the hook, hose and ladder events that were popular in New England. Farrell was much in demand as a No. 1 man on fire department teams and represented \\"many a team.\\" Each town's fire team was made up of 16 men, and Farrell was the captain of three hose teams in Massachusetts. In those competitions, a hose cart was placed 300 yards from a dummy hydrant, and the team pushed the cart to the hydrant where the hose was uncoupled and fastened to the hydrant as the cart then raced another 200 yards and the nozzle affixed to the hose. In the hook and ladder days, Farrell raced with some of the greats of the sport who later became major college track coaches, including Keene Fitzpatrick, Mike Murphy, Johnny Mack and Bill Donovan. =Caledonian games and Sheffield Handicap= Farrell became a regular in the \\"Caledonian games,\\" a professional track circuit in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Buffalo and Chicago. Farrell initially had success in middle distance events from 300 yards to a mile. He later shifted to the short sprint events and also became expert in the long jump and the triple jump. At one time, he also held the record in the standing backward jump at 11 feet. In 1891, the citizens of Leicester, Massachusetts provided Farrell with the financial backing to send him to England for the $15,000 Sheffield Handicap, then the world's foremost sprint event which was run over a turf course and attracted \\"the fastest sprinters in the world.\\" He won the Sheffield Handicap in 1891 and returned to win for a second time in March 1894, becoming the first American to win the event twice. After winning his second Sheffield Handicap, a Massachusetts newspaper reported: \\"Steve Farrell is perhaps the best known runner in the world, having swept the card of sprinters in both hemispheres.\\" In August 1891, 20,000 spectators watched Farrell compete in the Clan-Na-Gael athletic games in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Farrell won the half-mile race (which was \\"virtually a walk-over for Steve Farrell, who was never pushed for the race and won with consummate ease\\"), the 120-yards hurdle (with Farrell winning \\"in hollow style\\" after nearly falling over the first hurdle), and the standing hop, step and jump (with Farrell \\"winning comfortably with 33 feet, 10-1/2 inches\\"). Farrell finished second in the 220-yard race (though he had been \\"looked upon as a sure winner\\") and third in the three standing jumps. =Gambling and the handicap system= Farrell ran at a time when the races were handicap affairs in which \\"the winner would win by as narrow a margin as possible in order not to be severely handicapped in future races.\\" Because of the nature of the handicap system, there was uncertainty as to how fast Farrell could run. Walter Eckersall noted that it was likely that Farrell could run a 48-second quarter-mile based on a reported incident in which Farrell's backers wagered that he could make the time, but the backers of the opposing runner declined the bet. Gambling was a major element of professional foot-racing, and Farrell reportedly \\"earned a substantial living by betting on himself against the best men in Europe and America.\\" It is said that Farrell \\"earned more money from professional foot racing than any other man who made a livelihood from this sort of endeavor.\\" Matched against an English runner in London, Farrell met an Englishman on the boat trip to London and wagered his return passage money that he would win. Farrell won the race and doubled his return passage money. In November 1891, a riot nearly broke out when Farrell won a 300-yard race in Pittsburg with time of 34 seconds. One of the losing runner's backers was \\"with difficulty restrained\\" from shooting Farrell. A newspaper reported: \\"The race was regarded as a farce and for a time there was almost a riot. Betting was two to one in favor of Farrell.\\" =Racing career ended by collision with a dog= His professional running career came to an end in 1898 when he broke his ankle after tripping over a Newfoundland dog. Varying accounts exist as to Farrell's injury. In one version, Farrell was training with the dog. In another version, the dog was a stray that wandered on the track. According to a third version, a race had been arranged between Farrell and the dog, and Farrell and \\"the hound ran neck and neck, until the dog cut under the man, and Farrell tripped and fell.\\" Circus performer After gaining fame as the winner of the Sheffield Handicap, Farrell returned to the United States and signed up to race a horse at the Barnum & Bailey Circus in New York's Hippodrome. The \\"Horse vs. Man\\" race had become a regular feature of the Barnum & Bailey show, with the man being given a handicap in a footrace against a horse. Farrell announced that he would race against the horse with no handicap, and the widely publicized event drew 10,000 paying customers. Farrell defeated the horse and was put on the circus payroll. Farrell repeated the act on a regular basis, racing the horse twice around the sawdust arena. Farrell proudly noted that, in several years of racing horses with the circus, \\"he was beaten only half a dozen times by the horse.\\" Farrell often told another story about his circus work. He was once part of a parade with the entire circus troupe through the worst part of the Bowery in New York when they were met with \\"a shower of over-ripe eggs, tomatoes, bricks and deceased cats.\\" Farrell was thrown from his horse and \\"for once made excellent use of his excellent pair of legs\\" in running from the scene. Despite his speed, Farrell noted he was covered with eggs and full-grown tomatoes before he reached the first corner. Track coach =Yale, Maine and Ohio State= After his running career ended in 1898, Farrell spent four years as a private track instructor specializing in conditioning runners. In the fall of 1902, Farrell was hired by Mike Murphy to become the track coach at Yale University. After leading Yale to a successful track season, Farrell was hired as the track coach at the University of Maine where he remained for seven years. By 1908, Farrell had become one of the most popular figures at the University of Maine as shown in the following excerpt from the Daily Kennebeck Journal: > \\"'Steve' Farrell is without a doubt one of the most popular men at the > University of Maine and the student body holds him in the highest esteem not > only on account of his reputation throughout the country as a track coach > but also because he is a friend to every student at the university.\\" In December 1909, Farrell was hired by Ohio State University as coach of the track team and trainer of the football team.1910 Ohio State University Makio Yearbook, p.326 In December 1911, Farrell became involved in a struggle for power between the faculty and Student Athletic Board at Ohio State. Farrell bid farewell to the football team after a Thanksgiving game, noting that he did not believe he would be retained. According to a contemporary press account, \\"the entire squad thereupon, in tears, pledged themselves not to again compete in athletics.\\". They went on to chronicle his record and describe their admiration for him in the student newspaper, saying, \\"No one man has ever done more for Ohio State athletics than \\"Steve\\" Farrell Since his coming to Ohio State two years ago, a cleaner, more sportsman-like spirit has been instilled into every athlete coming under the trainers' influence.\\" =University of Michigan= In September 1912, Farrell was hired as the athletic trainer at the University of Michigan and noted at the time that the Ann Arbor institution \\"is the only western college that is thought much of down east.\\" He served as the school's track coach until his retirement in 1930, and he was also the trainer to Fielding H. Yost's football teams from 1912 to 1919. In 1915, a series of newspaper articles touted Farrell as an innovator in track coaching, noting his innovations in the following areas: * In February 1915, The New York Times reported on Farrell's novel plan to instill \\"enthusiasm and vim\\" in his athletes by having them train to the accompaniment of music played by the Varsity band. Farrell noted that his athletes had been taking more interest in dancing competitions than athletic training. Farrell planned to have the musicians \\"render tunes a trifle faster than the natural stride\\" of Michigan's best performer in each event. \\"It is expected that the inspiration of the music and the natural efforts of the dancers to get in time should make the Michigan men exert themselves more willingly than they are at present doing.\\" * In January 1915, Farrell introduced rope skipping as a training method for his long distance runners. Farrell noted, \\"It is a great form of exercise to develop the body, especially making men long winded and strong in the legs. It also has a tendency in making them quick and alert on their toes.\\" * Farrell instituted \\"the espionage system of discovering budding athletes\\" by stationing \\"a force of spies\\" in the college gymnasium watching for men of sufficient prowess to compete on the track team. The \\"new detective method of locating possible athletes\\" was begun after a freshman student was seen completing a high jump of six feet  six inches higher than any member of the track team. When Michigan rejoined the Big Ten Conference in 1918, Farrell's Michigan track teams promptly won the indoor and outdoor track championships in both 1918 and 1919. Between 1918 and 1930, Farrell's teams won ten Big Ten Conference championships. His teams had a 50-16-1 record in dual meets, and his athletes won 76 Big Ten individual event titles and 11 NCAA individual event titles. Michigan also won its only NCAA team track championship in 1923 under Farrell. While coaching at Michigan, Farrell's star athletes included: * Carl Johnson  the first athlete to win four events at a Big Ten Conference meet; silver medalist in the long jump at the 1920 Summer Olympics held in Antwerp, Belgium. * DeHart Hubbard  the first African American to win an Olympic gold medal in an individual event (the long jump at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris); Hubbard also set world records in the long jump () and the 100-yard dash (9.6 seconds); and * Eddie Tolan, gold medalist in the 100 and 200-meter races at the 1932 Summer Olympics. Walter Eckersall later wrote that, beyond coaching stars, Farrell was \\"a stickler for balance and depended more upon the ability of athletes to win third, fourth and fifth places than those who were picked to win.\\" He won many meets by focusing on team power and placing athletes where they could score points. Farrell remained fit even in his later years. In 1925, the 62-year-old coach reportedly beat some of his athletes with a standing backward jump of better than eight feet. When Farrell announced his retirement, the noted sports columnist Grantland Rice paid tribute to Farrell's talent in training sprinters. > \\"As long as Farrell is active he will continue to turn out championship > sprinters. The 'Steve start' is about the fastest thing uncovered. Michigan > sprinters are in the lead at ten yards. They're out in front here, even when > they're occasionally whipped. There is no finer influence on college > athletes in America than that which Steve exerts at Michigan ...\\" War service When the United States entered World War I, Farrell volunteered at age 53 and passed the Air Service examination. He served for six months at Ellington Field in Houston, Texas and Kelly Field in San Antonio. He was reported to be \\"the oldest commissioned flying officer in the air corps.\\" Death Farrell died of a heart attack at age 69 in October 1933 while on the first tee of the University of Michigan Golf Course in Ann Arbor.

From the beginning of fuzzy sets, criticism was made about the fact that the membership function of a type-1 fuzzy set has no uncertainty associated with it, something that seems to contradict the word fuzzy, since that word has the connotation of much uncertainty. So, what does one do when there is uncertainty about the value of the membership function? The answer to this question was provided in 1975 by the inventor of fuzzy sets, Lotfi A. ZadehL. A. Zadeh, \\"The Concept of a Linguistic Variable and Its Application to Approximate Reasoning‚Äì1,\\" Information Sciences, vol. 8, pp. 199‚Äì249, 1975., when he proposed more sophisticated kinds of fuzzy sets, the first of which he called a \\"type-2 fuzzy set\\". A type-2 fuzzy set lets us incorporate uncertainty about the membership function into fuzzy set theory, and is a way to address the above criticism of type-1 fuzzy sets head-on. And, if there is no uncertainty, then a type-2 fuzzy set reduces to a type-1 fuzzy set, which is analogous to probability reducing to determinism when unpredictability vanishes. Type1 fuzzy systems are working with a fixed membership function, while in type-2 fuzzy systems the membership function is fluctuating. A fuzzy set determines how input values are converted into fuzzy variables. Overview In order to symbolically distinguish between a type-1 fuzzy set and a type-2 fuzzy set, a tilde symbol is put over the symbol for the fuzzy set; so, A denotes a type-1 fuzzy set, whereas √É denotes the comparable type-2 fuzzy set. When the latter is done, the resulting type-2 fuzzy set is called a \\"general type-2 fuzzy set\\" (to distinguish it from the special interval type-2 fuzzy set). Zadeh didn't stop with type-2 fuzzy sets, because in that 1976 paper he also generalized all of this to type-n fuzzy sets. The present article focuses only on type-2 fuzzy sets because they are the next step in the logical progression from type-1 to type-n fuzzy sets, where n = 1, 2, ‚Ä¶ . Although some researchers are beginning to explore higher than type-2 fuzzy sets, as of early 2009, this work is in its infancy. Figure 1. The membership function of a general type-2 fuzzy set is three-dimensional. A cross-section of one slice of the third dimension is shown. This cross-section, as well as all others, sits on the FOU. Only the boundary of the cross-section is used to describe the membership function of a general type-2 fuzzy set. It is shown filled-in for artistic purposes. The membership function of a general type-2 fuzzy set, √É, is three- dimensional (Fig. 1), where the third dimension is the value of the membership function at each point on its two-dimensional domain that is called its \\"footprint of uncertainty\\"(FOU). For an interval type-2 fuzzy set that third- dimension value is the same (e.g., 1) everywhere, which means that no new information is contained in the third dimension of an interval type-2 fuzzy set. So, for such a set, the third dimension is ignored, and only the FOU is used to describe it. It is for this reason that an interval type-2 fuzzy set is sometimes called a first-order uncertainty fuzzy set model, whereas a general type-2 fuzzy set (with its useful third-dimension) is sometimes referred to as a second-order uncertainty fuzzy set model. Figure 2. FOU for an interval type-2 fuzzy set. Many other shapes are possible for the FOU. The FOU represents the blurring of a type-1 membership function, and is completely described by its two bounding functions (Fig. 2), a lower membership function (LMF) and an upper membership function (UMF), both of which are type-1 fuzzy sets! Consequently, it is possible to use type-1 fuzzy set mathematics to characterize and work with interval type-2 fuzzy sets. This means that engineers and scientists who already know type-1 fuzzy sets will not have to invest a lot of time learning about general type-2 fuzzy set mathematics in order to understand and use interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Work on type-2 fuzzy sets languished during the 1980s and early-to-mid 1990s, although a small number of articles were published about them. People were still trying to figure out what to do with type-1 fuzzy sets, so even though Zadeh proposed type-2 fuzzy sets in 1976, the time was not right for researchers to drop what they were doing with type-1 fuzzy sets to focus on type-2 fuzzy sets. This changed in the latter part of the 1990s as a result of Jerry Mendel and his student's works on type-2 fuzzy sets and systems.J. M. Mendel, Uncertain Rule- Based Fuzzy Logic Systems: Introduction and New Directions, Prentice-Hall, Upper-Saddle River, NJ, 2001. Since then, more and more researchers around the world are writing articles about type-2 fuzzy sets and systems. Interval type-2 fuzzy sets Interval type-2 fuzzy sets have received the most attention because the mathematics that is needed for such sets‚Äîprimarily Interval arithmetic‚Äîis much simpler than the mathematics that is needed for general type-2 fuzzy sets. So, the literature about interval type-2 fuzzy sets is large, whereas the literature about general type-2 fuzzy sets is much smaller. Both kinds of fuzzy sets are being actively researched by an ever- growing number of researchers around the world and have resulted in successful employment in a variety of domains such as robot control.Hassanzadeh, Hamid Reza, et al. \\"An interval-valued fuzzy controller for complex dynamical systems with application to a 3-PSP parallel robot.\\" Fuzzy sets and systems 235 (2014): 83-100.

Interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems Type-2 fuzzy sets are finding very wide applicability in rule-based fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) because they let uncertainties be modeled by them whereas such uncertainties cannot be modeled by type-1 fuzzy sets. A block diagram of a type-2 FLS is depicted in Fig. 3. This kind of FLS is used in fuzzy logic control, fuzzy logic signal processing, rule-based classification, etc., and is sometimes referred to as a function approximation application of fuzzy sets, because the FLS is designed to minimize an error function. Figure 3. Type-2 FLS The following discussions, about the four components in Fig. 3 rule-based FLS, are given for an interval type-2 FLS, because to-date they are the most popular kind of type-2 FLS; however, most of the discussions are also applicable for a general type-2 FLS. Rules, that are either provided by subject experts or are extracted from numerical data, are expressed as a collection of IF-THEN statements, e.g., :IF temperature is moderate and pressure is high, then rotate the valve a bit to the right. Fuzzy sets are associated with the terms that appear in the antecedents (IF-part) or consequents (THEN-part) of rules, and with the inputs to and the outputs of the FLS. Membership functions are used to describe these fuzzy sets, and in a type-1 FLS they are all type-1 fuzzy sets, whereas in an interval type-2 FLS at least one membership function is an interval type-2 fuzzy set. An interval type-2 FLS lets any one or all of the following kinds of uncertainties be quantified: # Words that are used in antecedents and consequents of rules‚Äîbecause words can mean different things to different people. # Uncertain consequents‚Äîbecause when rules are obtained from a group of experts, consequents will often be different for the same rule, i.e. the experts will not necessarily be in agreement. # Membership function parameters‚Äîbecause when those parameters are optimized using uncertain (noisy) training data, the parameters become uncertain. # Noisy measurements‚Äîbecause very often it is such measurements that activate the FLS. In Fig. 3, measured (crisp) inputs are first transformed into fuzzy sets in the Fuzzifier block because it is fuzzy sets and not numbers that activate the rules which are described in terms of fuzzy sets and not numbers. Three kinds of fuzzifiers are possible in an interval type-2 FLS. When measurements are: * Perfect, they are modeled as a crisp set; * Noisy, but the noise is stationary, they are modeled as a type-1 fuzzy set; and, * Noisy, but the noise is non-stationary, they are modeled as an interval type-2 fuzzy set (this latter kind of fuzzification cannot be done in a type-1 FLS). In Fig. 3, after measurements are fuzzified, the resulting input fuzzy sets are mapped into fuzzy output sets by the Inference block. This is accomplished by first quantifying each rule using fuzzy set theory, and by then using the mathematics of fuzzy sets to establish the output of each rule, with the help of an inference mechanism. If there are M rules then the fuzzy input sets to the Inference block will activate only a subset of those rules, where the subset contains at least one rule and usually way fewer than M rules. The inference is done one rule at a time. So, at the output of the Inference block, there will be one or more fired-rule fuzzy output sets. In most engineering applications of an FLS, a number (and not a fuzzy set) is needed as its final output, e.g., the consequent of the rule given above is \\"Rotate the valve a bit to the right.\\" No automatic valve will know what this means because \\"a bit to the right\\" is a linguistic expression, and a valve must be turned by numerical values, i.e. by a certain number of degrees. Consequently, the fired-rule output fuzzy sets have to be converted into a number, and this is done in the Fig. 3 Output Processing block. In a type-1 FLS, output processing, called \\"defuzzification\\", maps a type-1 fuzzy set into a number. There are many ways for doing this, e.g., compute the union of the fired-rule output fuzzy sets (the result is another type-1 fuzzy set) and then compute the center of gravity of the membership function for that set; compute a weighted average of the centers of gravity of each of the fired rule consequent membership functions; etc. Things are somewhat more complicated for an interval type-2 FLS, because to go from an interval type-2 fuzzy set to a number (usually) requires two steps (Fig. 3). The first step, called \\"type- reduction\\", is where an interval type-2 fuzzy set is reduced to an interval- valued type-1 fuzzy set. There are as many type-reduction methods as there are type-1 defuzzification methods. An algorithm developed by Karnik and Mendel now known as the \\"KM algorithm\\" is used for type-reduction. Although this algorithm is iterative, it is very fast. The second step of Output Processing, which occurs after type-reduction, is still called \\"defuzzification\\". Because a type-reduced set of an interval type-2 fuzzy set is always a finite interval of numbers, the defuzzified value is just the average of the two end-points of this interval. It is clear from Fig. 3 that there can be two outputs to an interval type-2 FLS‚Äîcrisp numerical values and the type-reduced set. The latter provides a measure of the uncertainties that have flowed through the interval type-2 FLS, due to the (possibly) uncertain input measurements that have activated rules whose antecedents or consequents or both are uncertain. Just as standard deviation is widely used in probability and statistics to provide a measure of unpredictable uncertainty about a mean value, the type- reduced set can provide a measure of uncertainty about the crisp output of an interval type-2 FLS. Computing with words Another application for fuzzy sets has also been inspired by ZadehL. A. Zadeh, \\"Fuzzy logic = computing with words,\\" IEEE Trans. on Fuzzy Systems, vol. 4, pp. 103‚Äì111, 1996.L. A. Zadeh, \\"From computing with numbers to computing with words‚Äîfrom manipulation of measurements to manipulation of perceptions,\\" IEEE Trans. on Circuits and Systems‚Äì1, Fundamental Theory and Applications, vol. 4, pp. 105‚Äì119, 1999.L. A. Zadeh, \\"Toward human level machine intelligence‚Äîis it achievable? The need for a new paradigm shift,\\" IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, vol. 3, pp. 11‚Äì22, August 2008. ‚Äî \\"Computing with Words\\". Different acronyms have been used for \\"computing with words,\\" e.g., CW and CWW. According to Zadeh: :CWW is a methodology in which the objects of computation are words and propositions drawn from a natural language. [It is] inspired by the remarkable human capability to perform a wide variety of physical and mental tasks without any measurements and any computations. Of course, he did not mean that computers would actually compute using words‚Äîsingle words or phrases‚Äîrather than numbers. He meant that computers would be activated by words, which would be converted into a mathematical representation using fuzzy sets and that these fuzzy sets would be mapped by a CWW engine into some other fuzzy set after which the latter would be converted back into a word. A natural question to ask is: Which kind of fuzzy set‚Äîtype-1 or type-2‚Äîshould be used as a model for a word? MendelJ. M. Mendel, \\"Fuzzy Sets for Words: a New Beginning,\\" Proc. IEEE FUZZ Conference, St. Louis, MO, May 26‚Äì28, 2003, pp. 37‚Äì42.J. M. Mendel, \\"Computing with Words: Zadeh, Turing, Popper and Occam,\\" IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, vol. 2, pp. 10‚Äì17, November 2007. has argued, on the basis of Karl Popper's concept of \\"falsificationism\\",K. Popper, The Logic of Scientific Discovery (translation of Logik der Forschung), Hutchinson, London, 1959. that using a type-1 fuzzy set as a model for a word is scientifically incorrect. An interval type-2 fuzzy set should be used as a (first-order uncertainty) model for a word. Much research is underway about CWW.

It is a one- story, rubble stone, three-bay church with a slate-covered gabled roof. It was among the first structures used by Methodists in colonial America. History On October 16, 1751, Henry Watters was born near the present site of the church. After being converted to the Methodist faith at the Presbury meeting in 1771, he came back to his home to start a church. He was known as being one of the first American \\"itinerant\\" preachers. Around the same time, a log structure was built on the site. It was known as the \\"Watters Meeting House\\", but unfortunately the structure was destroyed by a fire years later. The current structure, made of stone, was erected around 1840 on the very spot that the previous log building once stood. It served the Methodist church for many years. The church grew and later became the home of Daniel Ruff, a circuit rider of the Methodist Episcopal Church.Thomas Run Foundation, Inc. According to records at the Lovely Lane Methodist Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, the Church was part of the Darlington Methodist Charge, which included Darlington United Methodist Church and Rock Run United Methodist Church. Records from the Lovely Lane Museum also show that the church celebrated its 150th anniversary in August 1932. It was shared with the other churches in the celebrations, which lasted for a couple weeks. In 1931, Reverend Raymond E. Manley came to serve the charge. In his memoirs, he writes of the interesting travel to the church every week: \\"There were three churches- Darlington, Rock Run, and Thomas Run. It was an adventure to go to Thomas Run which was miles back from the main road and the road leading to the church was not kept, which made it hard on a car. This church was kept up by one family and they paid their part regularly.\\"Memoirs of Reverend Raymond E. Manley, served the church from 1931 to 1934. In 1945, the church closed its doors. It has remained with the Darlington Methodist charge since. For many years, activities still occurred at the church. In 1947, it is known that youth activities from all three churches met there for an entire weekend. Currently, services are held semiannually with one on the first Sunday of June and the other on the first Sunday of October. In March 1996, an arson set fire to the building resulting in complete destruction of the interior. Luckily, photos were used to help reconstruct the inside as close as possible. The church was re-dedicated in October 2000. The church was purchased by Blanche and Lester Pyle in 1963 from the Methodist Conference. It is now run by the Thomas Run Foundation, Inc.

This temple was built over the Samadhi of a famous saint of Tamil Nadu, known as Malaiperumal Swamigal. History The construction of the temple started by the initiative taken by the local villagers, when the Siththar was alive, during the 19th Century. Due to additional funds required to complete the construction, a local businessman, Subba Pillai, travelled to South Africa, and provided additional funds to complete the work. It is said that once he returned from South Africa, the saint, Malaiperumal Siththar attained Samadhi in the temple. Later, a Shiva Lingam was placed over the mausoleum of the saint and worshipped. This idol is still kept intact and worshipped by the Alathur village residents and devotees from around the world. Idols in the temple There are other idols in the temple too, including those of Vinayaka, Subramaniya-Valli-Deivayanai, Bhairava, goddess Kamalambika, Chandikeswarar.

Geologists usually study geology, although backgrounds in physics, chemistry, biology, and other sciences are also useful. Field work is an important component of geology, although many subdisciplines incorporate laboratory work. Geologists work in the energy and mining sectors searching for natural resources such as petroleum, natural gas, precious and base metals. They are also in the forefront of preventing and mitigating damage from natural hazards and disasters such as earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis and landslides. Their studies are used to warn the general public of the occurrence of these events. Geologists are also important contributors to climate change discussions. History Scotsman James Hutton, father of modern geology James Hutton is often viewed as the first modern geologist.James Hutton: The Founder of Modern Geology , American Museum of Natural History In 1785 he presented a paper entitled Theory of the Earth to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In his paper, he explained his theory that the Earth must be much older than had previously been supposed to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for sediments to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea, which in turn were raised up to become dry land. Hutton published a two-volume version of his ideas in 1795 (Vol. 1, Vol. 2). Followers of Hutton were known as Plutonists because they believed that some rocks were formed by vulcanism, which is the deposition of lava from volcanoes, as opposed to the Neptunists, led by Abraham Werner, who believed that all rocks had settled out of a large ocean whose level gradually dropped over time. \\"Geologists at work\\" from the U.S. Geological and Geographic Survey of the Territories. (1874 - 06/30/1879) Photographer: William Henry Jackson The first geological map of the United States was produced in 1809 by William Maclure. In 1807, Maclure commenced the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States. Almost every state in the Union was traversed and mapped by him; the Allegheny Mountains being crossed and recrossed some 50 times.Page 39 in Greene, J.C. and Burke, J.G. (1978) The Science of Minerals in the Age of Jefferson. Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, New Series, Vol. 68, No. 4, pp. 1-113 The results of his unaided labors were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir entitled Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological Map, and published in the Society's Transactions, together with the nation's first geological map. This antedates William Smith's geological map of England by six years, although it was constructed using a different classification of rocks. Sir Charles Lyell first published his famous book, Principles of Geology, in 1830. This book, which influenced the thought of Charles Darwin, successfully promoted the doctrine of uniformitarianism. This theory states that slow geological processes have occurred throughout the Earth's history and are still occurring today. In contrast, catastrophism is the theory that Earth's features formed in single, catastrophic events and remained unchanged thereafter. Though Hutton believed in uniformitarianism, the idea was not widely accepted at the time.  Education  A young geologist learns about flow banding For an aspiring geologist, training typically includes significant coursework in physics, mathematics, and chemistry, in addition to classes offered through the geology department; historical and physical geology, igneous and metamorphic petrology and petrography, hydrogeology, sedimentology, stratigraphy, mineralogy, palaeontology, physical geography and structural geology are among the many required areas of study. Most geologists also need skills in GIS and other mapping techniques. Geology students often spend portions of the year, especially the summer though sometimes during a January term, living and working under field conditions with faculty members (often referred to as \\"field camp\\"). Many non-geologists often take geology courses or have expertise in geology that they find valuable to their fields; this is common in the fields of geography, engineering, chemistry, urban planning, environmental studies, among others. = Specialization = A geologist working in the Arctic Geologists exploring Jurassic sedimentary rocks in Makhtesh Gadol, Negev Desert, Israel Geologist explaining the importance of volcanic ash layers to students on field in Iceland Geologists may concentrate their studies or research in one or more of the following disciplines: * Economic geology: the study of ore genesis, and the mechanisms of ore creation, geostatistics. * Engineering geology: application of the geologic sciences to engineering practice for the purpose of assuring that the geologic factors affecting the location, design, construction, operation and maintenance of engineering works are recognized and adequately provided for; * Geophysics: the applied branch deals with the application of physical methods such as gravity, seismicity, electricity, magnetic properties to study the earth. * Geochemistry: the applied branch deals with the study of the chemical makeup and behaviour of rocks, and the study of the behaviour of their minerals. * Geochronology: the study of isotope geology specifically toward determining the date within the past of rock formation, metamorphism, mineralization and geological events (notably, meteorite impacts). * Geomorphology: the study of landforms and the processes that create them * Hydrogeology: the study of the origin, occurrence and movement of groundwater water in a subsurface geological system. * Igneous petrology: the study of igneous processes such as igneous differentiation, fractional crystallization, intrusive and volcanological phenomena. * Isotope geology: the case of the isotopic composition of rocks to determine the processes of rock and planetary formation. * Metamorphic petrology: the study of the effects of metamorphism on minerals and rocks. * Marine geology: the study of the seafloor; involves geophysical, geochemical, sedimentological and paleontological investigations of the ocean floor and coastal margins. Marine geology has strong ties to physical oceanography and plate tectonics. * Palaeoclimatology: the application of geological science to determine the climatic conditions present in the Earth's atmosphere within the Earth's history. * Palaeontology: the classification and taxonomy of fossils within the geological record and the construction of a palaeontological history of the Earth. * Pedology: the study of soil, soil formation, and regolith formation. * Petroleum geology: the study of sedimentary basins applied to the search for hydrocarbons (oil exploration). * Planetary geology: the study of geology as it relates to other celestial bodies, namely planets and their moons. This includes the subdiscipline of lunar geology, selenology, and martian geology, areology. * Sedimentology: the study of sedimentary rocks, strata, formations, eustasy and the processes of modern-day sedimentary and erosive systems. * Seismology: The study of earthquakes. * Structural geology: the study of folds, faults, foliation and rock microstructure to determine the deformational history of rocks and regions. * Volcanology: the study of volcanoes, their eruptions, lavas, magma processes and hazards. Employment \\"Picturesque camp made by a lone geologist on the cinders of Inferno\\". This photo was taken during a U.S. Department of the Interior Geological Survey in 1921 Professional geologists work for a wide range of government agencies, private firms, and non-profit and academic institutions. They are usually hired on a contract basis or hold permanent positions within private firms or official agencies (such as the United States Geologic Survey). Local, state, and national governments hire geologists to work on geological projects that are of interest to the public community. The investigation of a country's natural resources is often a key role when working for government institutions; the work of the geologist in this field can be made publicly available to help the community make more informed decisions related to the exploitation of resources, management of the environment and the safety of critical infrastructure - all of which is expected to bring greater wellbeing to the country.Geoscience Australia, Our Role, December 16, 2010, http://www.ga.gov.au/about-us/our-role.html, Accessed: May 12, 2011 This 'wellbeing' is often in the form of greater tax revenues from new or extended mining projects or through better infrastructure and/or natural disaster planning. Geologist mud logging, common in petroleum and water-well drilling An engineering geologist is employed to investigate geologic hazards and geologic constraints for the planning, design and construction of public and private engineering projects, forensic and post- mortem studies, and environmental impact analysis. Exploration geologists use all aspects of geology and geophysics to locate and study natural resources. In many countries or U.S. states without specialized environmental remediation licensure programs, the environmental remediation field is often dominated by professional geologists, particularly hydrogeologists, with professional concentrations in this aspect of the field. Petroleum and mining companies use mudloggers, and large-scale land developers use the skills of geologists and engineering geologists to help them locate oil and minerals, adapt to local features such as karst topography or earthquake risk, and comply with environmental regulations. Geologists in academia usually hold an advanced degree in a specialized area within their geological discipline and are employed by universities. Professional designation The rock hammer and hand lens (or loupe) are two of the most characteristic tools carried by geologists in the field. In Canada, National Instrument 43-101 requires reports containing estimates of mineral resources and reserves to be prepared by, or under the supervision of, a Qualified Person (QP) who has at least five years of experience with the reported minerals and is a member of a professional association. The QP accepts personal liability for the professional quality of the report and underlying work. The rules and guidelines codified in National Instrument 43-101 were introduced after a scandal in 1997 where Bre-X geologists salted drill core samples at a gold exploration property in Busang, Indonesia. The falsified drilling results misled Bre-X investors and upon discovery of the fraud, the company collapsed in the largest gold mining scam in history.

In his career, spanning 70 years, he composed at least 300 songs and released nearly 100 albums, among them Canadian and American patriotic songs. Brand's music ran the gamut from novelty songs to serious social commentary and spanned a number of genres. Brand also wrote a number of short stories. And for 70 years, he was the host of a weekly folk music show on WNYC Radio in New York City, which is credited as the longest running radio show with only one host in broadcasting history. Life and career Brand was born to a Jewish family in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. His father was a Romanian-born flooring contractor, Isidore Brand. His mother was named Beatrice. In 1927, the family moved to Minneapolis, then to Chicago and ultimately to New York City. As a young man, Oscar lived in Borough Park, Brooklyn and graduated from Erasmus Hall High School and later from Brooklyn College with a BS in psychology. In his long career he played alongside such legends of folk music as Lead Belly, Woody Guthrie, Josh White, Jean Ritchie, the Weavers and Pete Seeger. He wrote various books on the folk song and folk song collections, including The Ballad Mongers: Rise of the American Folk Song, Songs Of '76: A Folksinger's History Of The Revolution and Bawdy Songs & Backroom Ballads, the latter comprising four volumes. Brand was known for composing catchy and themed folk songs, including the eponymous theme to his initially CTV and then CBC television show Let's Sing Out and the Canadian patriotic song \\"Something to Sing About\\" (actual title: \\"This Land of Ours\\"), which is one of Canada's national songs. He was also a frequent performer at the Mariposa Folk Festival during this period, including performances in 1962, 1968, 1969, and 1987, as well as the 50th anniversary in 2010. He collaborated on a number of musicals, most notably The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N (a musical version of Leo Rosten's stories about the fictional Jewish character Hyman Kaplan), How to Steal an Election, and A Joyful Noise. He hosted the radio show Oscar Brand's Folksong Festival on Saturdays at 10:00 p.m. on WNYC-AM 820 in New York City, which ran into its 70th year. The show ran more or less continuously since its debut on December 10, 1945, making it the longest-running radio show with the same host, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. Over its run it introduced such talents to the world as Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Woody Guthrie, Arlo Guthrie, Huddie Ledbetter, Joni Mitchell, Peter, Paul & Mary, Judy Collins, the Kingston Trio, Pete Seeger and the Weavers. In order to make sure that his radio program could not be censored he refused to be paid by WNYC for the next 70 years. He wrote the lyrics to the song \\"A Guy is a Guy\\" (1952), which became a hit for Doris Day. He also wrote the English lyrics to the song \\"Shlub-a-Dubba-Dub\\" (1961) which became a minor hit for Mitch Miller. He contributed stories and songs for the \\"Young People's Records\\" label, including \\"Noah's Ark\\". He was a friend of the folksinger Jean Ritchie for many years. They recorded several duets together, including the British song \\"Keys to Canterbury\\". Although Brand was anti-Stalinist and was never a member of any Communist party, the House Committee on Un-American Activities referred to his show as a \\"pipeline of communism\\", because of his belief in the rights under the First Amendment of blacklisted artists to have a platform to reach the public. Accordingly, in June 1950, Brand was named in the premier issue of Red Channels as a Communist sympathizer, along with Paul Robeson, Josh White and Pete Seeger. While Brand was not as well-known or radical an activist as some of his contemporaries, he was a long-standing supporter of civil rights. He told stories of buying food for Leadbelly when the two traveled together in segregated areas, and participated in the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches. Brand was one of the original organizers of the Newport Folk Festival which began in 1959. In the early 1960s, Brand brought his substantial connections in the worldwide folk music community home to his native Canada with his CTV and then CBC television program Let's Sing Out. The program was staged at and broadcast from university campuses across Canada and both revived the careers of long-forgotten pioneers of the folk music movement such as Malvina Reynolds, the Womenfolk, The Weavers and others and introduced then-unknown Canadian singers such as Joni Mitchell and Gordon Lightfoot.\\"Oscar Brand\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia His score for the 1968 Off-Broadway show, How to Steal An Election sent up the current belief that charisma would help a candidate win. Songs included \\"Charisma\\" (sung by Calvin Coolidge) and \\"Down Among the Grassroots\\". The album cover was decorated with election buttons including the 1968 Nixon campaign. Brand also served during the 1960s as a board member of the Children's Television Workshop and participated in the development of Sesame Street. Because of some mild disagreements that had occurred between Brand and the board members regarding the appropriate setting for the show, it has been reputed that as a playful joke, the character of Oscar the Grouch was named after him, although there are dueling tales as to the origin of the character.Sunday Edition, CBC Radio, 7 February 2010. In May 1976, Brand appeared in Madison Square Garden's Felt Forum at the memorial celebration for Phil Ochs, performing Ochs' \\"Love Me I'm A Liberal\\" with updated lyrics. Brand was given the Peabody Award for broadcast excellence in 1982 for his broadcast The Sunday Show on National Public Radio, and was awarded the Personal Peabody Award in 1995 (shared with Oprah Winfrey). Brand authored a number of short stories, including: *\\"The Miser's Gold\\", about two young brothers who dare each other to spend the night in an allegedly haunted house - only to discover that \\"allegedly\\" is inapplicable. The boys encounter the ghost of a wealthy but lonely man; greatly amused by their reasons for being there, he names them as heirs to his considerable fortune. *\\"The Hitchhiker\\", about a young man who, on his way home from a party, picks up a beautiful young woman who turns out to be much more than she seems. Dramatic readings of these stories were issued as cut-out cardboard records on the back of Honeycomb cereal boxes. On January 18, 2010, WoodSongs Old-Time Radio Hour celebrated Brand's upcoming 90th birthday and the 65th anniversary of his radio career before an audience from Lexington, Kentucky, where host Michael Johnathan and guest Josh White, Jr. performed with Brand and talked with him about his life. On February 7, 2010, CBC Radio's Sunday Edition celebrated Brand's life on the occasion of his 90th birthday. Brand died of pneumonia on September 30, 2016, at the age of 96. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Brand among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

Vacancy The by-election was caused by the death on 30 July 1919 of the sitting Coalition Liberal Member of Parliament, Sir Joseph Compton-Rickett. He was 72 years old. He had been an MP in the area since 1906 when he was elected for Osgoldcross. He had been Lloyd George's Paymaster General since 1916. Electoral history The Pontefract constituency had been Liberal since 1893 and Osgoldcross Liberal since 1885. At the General election in 1918, Compton-Rickett was re-elected with the support of the Coalition Government 'coupon'. Candidates The by-election was a straight fight between Isaac Burns for the Labour Party, the nominee of the Yorkshire Miners' Association The Times, 7 August 1919 p7 and 50-year-old Walter Forrest, a woollen manufacturer from Pudsey for the Coalition Government of Prime Minister David Lloyd George, although the Liberals apparently had some trouble in finding a candidate at first.The Times, 13 August 1919 p11 The local Conservatives endorsed the candidacy of their Coalition partners The Times, 12 August 1919 p12 and the Independent Asquithian Liberals did not bring a forward a candidate. Campaign =Labour= The health of the coal mining industry was an issue which Isaac Burns particularly sought to make his own against the background of a coal strike taking place in the area.The Times, 27 August 1919 p12 He was hampered by the fact that although coal mining was a major industry in the area, the principal colliery towns had been attached to other constituencies in boundary changes Edith Adelaide Harrison, English By- elections Since 1918: A Study of By-elections as an Index to Changes in Political Opinion; University of California, May, 1921 p79 and mining was not necessarily decisive as there were many other interests in the constituency. Agriculture dominated around Barkston Ash and there was shipping and coastal trades around Goole. Many in these industries were adversely affected by the coal strike and were unsympathetic to Burns and Labour as a result.The Times, 6 September 1919 p12 Burns stated he was in favour of a number of Labour policies including equal adult franchise for both sexes, pensions for mothers and free secondary education for all. He was in favour of widespread nationalisation of industry and a programme of public works to keep down unemployment. He also wanted Home Rule for Ireland and local government for India.The Times, 29 August 1919 p10 =Liberal= Walter Forrest set out his position on a number of questions at his meetings of both the local Coalition Liberals and Unionist parties. He was opposed to the nationalisation of the coal mines and conscription, in favour of some relaxation of the liquor laws for the benefit of working men and improved welfare for men disabled in the war; he was also in favour of the full restoration of trade and commerce as soon as conditions allowed, to increase output and living standards.The Times, 18 August 1919 p7 He also strongly advocated economy and retrenchment but one of the Liberal MPs who visited the constituency to speak for him, Dr T J Macnamara the Secretary to the Admiralty, in a speech designed to protect the position of his Department and no doubt appeal to the patriotic feelings of working class and Unionist voters, was keen to point out that national security must take precedence over economy. Result Forrest retained the seat for the government but with a reduced majority.

Bush in Raghadan Palace in 2006 Al-Maquar (, English: \\"Headquarters\\") is a royal residential complex in Amman, Jordan. The compound spans 40 hectares and serves as the residence of the royal family of Jordan. The area was originally the camp-site for the armies of the Arab Revolt, who captured Amman in 1918. The first palace to be built on the complex was the Raghadan Palace, completed in 1926. Raghadan became the official residence of the first King of Jordan, King Abdullah I, who then went on to commission the construction of two more, smaller palaces in the 1930s; Al-Ma'wa (The Sanctuary) and Al-Qasr as-Saghir (The Small Palace). Construction on another, larger project, the Basman Palace, began in 1950. Although it was originally intended solely as a guesthouse, Basman became King Hussein's primary residence after he ascended to the throne in 1953, at the age of 18, following the death of Abdullah I and the brief reign of his father Talal. The King changed residence in the 1970s, this time to the Hashimiya Palace to the north-west. Following his move, Basman Palace became the official offices of the Royal Court, a function it continues to serve. Also located at Al-Maquar is the royal graveyard, where Kings Abdullah I, Talal and Hussein were buried. The Nadwa Palace was also built on the compound, originally as the home for Prince Nayef, the second son of Abdullah I, although Hussein and his family used it as their official residence from 1980, prior to moving to the Bab as-Salam Palace. It currently serves as a guest palace. At the entrance to the compound the Raghadan Flagpole, the third tallest free-standing flagpole in the world at 126 metres high flies a 60-by-30 metre Jordanian flag, which is clearly visible across the city. The residence of the British regent were built near the palaces and this is where the current monarchs of Jordan; King Abdullah II, Queen Rania and their children reside.

It is found on the Atlantic slope of Costa Rica, between the San Juan River drainage and the Banano River. Several currently recognized cichlid species within the genus Amatitlania were formerly considered varieties of Amatitlania septumfasciata, including Amatitlania myrnae, the Topaz Cichlid, and Amatitlania cutteri (which also sometimes uses the common name \\"Cutter's Cichlid\\"). Prior to being placed in the genus Amatitlania, it had been considered a member of the genus Archocentrus. Within Amatitlania, Amatitlania septemfasciata is placed in the subgenus Bussingius, along with the T-bar Cichlid and several other species. However, a 2008 study led by Oldrich Rican has suggested that all the related species A. septemfasciatus, should be moved into the genus Hypsophrys. Natural history Amatitlania septemfasciata grows to between . Males are typically larger than females. Both sexes generally have six vertical bars along each side. Females have a black spot or ocellus on the dorsal fin, which is generally surrounded by metallic coloration. It lives in rivers on the Atlantic slope of Costa Rica. It can be found in rivers of all velocities, including slow moving and fast moving rivers. The bottom of the rivers it lives in are generally covered by rocks and leaf litter. In its natural habitat, the pH is generally between 6.6 and 7.6 and the water temperature is between 21 and 27 degrees Celsius (70 to 81 degrees Fahrenheit). Its ability to protrude its jaw 3.5% standard length limits its diet to about 1% evasive prey. Amatitlania septemfasciata is an egg layer and a cave spawner. In breeds in crevices in the rocks at the bottom of the river. Spawnings typically result in 200 to 250 fry. The conservation status of Amatitlania septemfasciata has not been evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Aquarium keeping Amatitlania septemfasciata is kept in home aquariums. It is territorial, and thus a fairly large tank that is at least long is generally recommended. It can be kept at a temperature of between 24 and 26 degrees Celsius (75 to 79 degrees Fahrenheit), and pH of about 7.0. In the home aquarium, it is willing to eat a wide variety of foods, including flake food, live foods, frozen foods, beef heart and shrimp. Amatitlania septemfasciata can be bred in the home aquarium. It will either spawn in a cave or in the open. A temperature increase to 26 and 28 degrees Celsius (79 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit) helps induce spawning. The larvae hatch 72 to 80 hours after spawning, and are free swimming after 180 to 200 hours. The parents do not eat the fry, but rather both parents care for the fry intensively. The fry eat newly hatched brine shrimp.

The gardens are owned by a number of private owners, managed by Essential Edinburgh and opened to the public in 2008. The construction of St Andrew Square began in 1772,Lang, p.124 as the first part of the New Town, designed by James Craig. Within six years of its completion St Andrew Square became one of the most desirable and most fashionable residential areas in the city. As the 19th century came to a close, St Andrew Square evolved into the commercial centre of the city. Most of the square used to be made up of major offices of banks and insurance companies, making it one of the major financial centres in Scotland. At one time, St Andrew Square could claim to be the richest area of its size in the whole of Scotland.Lang, p.125 It now also has shops, including the department store Harvey Nichols, the Edinburgh Grand Hotel and apartments, and a series of London chain restaurants and bars on its south side, such as Hawksmoor, Drake & Morgan, Dishoom and The Ivy. Points of interest Melville Monument, St Andrew Square Dominating the centre of St Andrew Square is the fluted column of the Melville Monument, commemorating Henry Dundas, the first Viscount Melville, best known for campaigning for the abolition of slavery.Wilson and Smallman, p.83 The Melville Monument is surrounded by St Andrew Square Gardens, recently redesigned and opened to the public. On the east side of the square stands the impressive mansion of Dundas House, built by Sir William Chambers for Sir Lawrence Dundas between 1772 and 1774. Once the intended site for St Andrew's Church, Dundas House became the head office of the Royal Bank of Scotland in 1825.Wilson and Smallman, p.84 Architectural features of Dundas House are represented today on the \\"Ilay\\" series of banknotes issued by the Royal Bank; the building's Palladian facade features on the obverse of each note, and the background graphic on both sides of the notes is a radial star design which is based on the ornate ceiling of the banking hall inside Dundas House, designed by John Dick Peddie in 1857. A short distance from Dundas House, down George Street, is where St. Andrew's Church was built in 1784. In 1806 the head office of the British Linen Bank moved to St. Andrew Square. The building was a branch of the Bank of Scotland until 2016. St. Andrew Square was also home to the National Bank of Scotland, which was headquartered at No. 42, until it merged with the Royal Bank of Scotland in 1969. Beneath the eastern streets of the square lies the long disused Scotland Street Tunnel, which continues under the New Town to Canonmills. The tunnel was built in 1847 as part of the Edinburgh, Leith and Newhaven Railway. Its southern end was demolished in the 1980s during the construction of the Waverley Market shopping centre. Notable residents Many famous Scots occupied the residences of St Andrew Square. On the north side of the square, No. 21 was the birthplace of Lord Henry Brougham in 1778. His family was one of the first families to take up residency in St Andrew Square. Another resident was philosopher and economist David Hume, friend of architect Robert Adam. Hume was persuaded to move to St Andrew Square by Adam with the hopes that the recruitment of such a powerful person would induce others to cross from the Old Town to the New Town and St Andrew Square. Hume chose a site on the southwest side of the square at the corner of Princes Street and an unnamed street (later named St David Street).Daiches, p.130 Also on the north side, No. 26 was the home to architect Sir William Chambers. Transport Edinburgh Bus Station St Andrew Square has been used as a transport hub for a number of years. The former St Andrew Square Bus station was redeveloped in 2003 to incorporate a new luxury shopping street, Multrees Walk, and the Edinburgh branch of Harvey Nichols. = Buses = Edinburgh Bus Station is located to the east of the square. It is served by long-distance bus & coach operators, such as Scottish Citylink and Stagecoach Fife. Local bus services have stops to the north of the square and on North St David Street. = Tram = The square acquired a tram stop on its eastern side in May 2014, when the new Edinburgh Trams came into operation. This is the nearest stop for Edinburgh Waverley railway station which lies approx 400m south, and for Edinburgh bus station which is 50m to the north. Trams operate from St Andrew Square to Edinburgh Airport, calling at thirteen intermediate stops. References Bibliography *Campbell, Donald. Edinburgh: A Cultural and Literary History.

The project Social Media and Political Participation (SMaPP) relies on both survey data and publicly available social media data to address a range of questions concerning the causal processes that shape political participation. Network inference and systems biology Along with Vestienn Thorsson, David Reiss and Nitin Baliga he developed the Inferelator and cMonkey, two algorithms that were critical to an effort to learn a genome-wide model of the Halobacterium regulatory network. Baliga and Bonneau used their model to predict the genome- wide transcriptional dynamics of the cell‚Äôs response to new environments (publication in Cell in December 2007). This work represents the first fully data driven reconstruction of a cells regulatory network to include learning of kinetic/dynamical parameters as well as network topology.

Life All the known facts of his life and activity are from the Musikalischen Lexikon by Johann Gottfried Walther (Johann Sebastian Bach's cousin), a dictionary which first appeared in 1732. J.J. Walther was born in Witterda bei Erfurt. Between 1670 and 1674 he is said to have remained a violinist in the orchestra of Cosimo III of the Medicis in Florence. From 1674 he was concertmaster at the court of Dresden. After the death of his patron in 1680 he became the Italian secretary at the elector's court in Mainz and was ordained a canon. He died in Mainz. Alongside Biber and Westhoff, J.J. Walther is one of the most significant German violinists of the 17th century. Besides a virtuoso technique including doublestops and arpeggios, his works display a wealth of formal devices, especially in the treatment of ostinato variations. Works 40 compositions are known, contained in two volumes: #Scherzi da Violino solo con il basso continuo, published in 1676. This cycle anticipates Paganini's technique in that it contains pizzicato harp imitations while the bow imitates nightingale song. #Hortulus chelicus published in 1688 (in the second printing of 1694 with the new title Wohlgepflanzter Violinischer Lustgarten). In the foreword, Walther expresses his confidence that this self- published volume will enjoy the same success as its predecessor. It contains 28 pieces and is more varied than the other collection.

RCP 2.6 is the scenario where emissions peak before 2020, RCP 4.5 the one where they peak around 2040, and RCP 8.5 the one where they keep increasing as usual. Since at least the start of the 20th century, the average global sea level has been rising. Between 1900 and 2016, the sea level rose by . More precise data gathered from satellite radar measurements reveal an accelerating rise of from 1993 to 2017, which is a trend of roughly per century. This acceleration is due mostly to human-caused global warming, which is driving thermal expansion of seawater and the melting of land-based ice sheets and glaciers. Between 1993 and 2018, thermal expansion of the oceans contributed 42% to sea level rise; the melting of temperate glaciers, 21%; Greenland, 15%; and Antarctica, 8%. Climate scientists expect the rate to further accelerate during the 21st century. Under all RCP scenarios, the rate of sea level rise will very likely exceed the rate of 2.0 [1.7‚Äì2.3] mm/yr observed during 1971‚Äì2010 Projecting future sea level is challenging, due to the complexity of many aspects of the climate system. As climate research into past and present sea levels leads to improved computer models, projections have consistently increased. In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected a high end estimate of through 2099,\\"Models used to date do not include uncertainties in climate- carbon cycle feedback nor do they include the full effects of changes in ice sheet flow, because a basis in published literature is lacking.\\" but their 2014 report raised the high-end estimate to about . A number of later studies have concluded that a global sea level rise of this century is \\"physically plausible\\".Ice sheet contributions to future sea-level rise from structured expert judgment\\"The projections and results presented in several peer-reviewed publications provide evidence to support a physically plausible GMSL rise in the range of 2.0 meters (m) to 2.7 m, and recent results regarding Antarctic ice-sheet instability indicate that such outcomes may be more likely than previously thought.\\" A conservative estimate of the long-term projections is that each Celsius degree of temperature rise triggers a sea level rise of approximately 2.3 meters (4.2 ft/degree Fahrenheit) over a period of two millennia (2,000 years): an example of climate inertia. The sea level will not rise uniformly everywhere on Earth, and it will even drop slightly in some locations, such as the Arctic. Local factors include tectonic effects and subsidence of the land, tides, currents and storms. Sea level rises can affect human populations considerably in coastal and island regions. Widespread coastal flooding is expected with several degrees of warming sustained for millennia.Box SYN-1: Sustained warming could lead to severe impacts, p. 5, in: Synopsis, in Further effects are higher storm-surges and more dangerous tsunamis, displacement of populations, loss and degradation of agricultural land and damage in cities. Natural environments like marine ecosystems are also affected, with fish, birds and plants losing parts of their habitat. Societies can respond to sea level rise in three different ways: to retreat, to accommodate, and to protect. Sometimes these adaptation strategies go hand in hand, but at other times choices have to be made among different strategies. Ecosystems that adapt to rising sea levels by moving inland might not always be able to do so, due to natural or artificial barriers.  Past changes in sea level  last glacial episode Understanding past sea level is important for the analysis of current and future changes. In the recent geological past, changes in land ice and thermal expansion from increased temperatures are the dominant reasons of sea level rise. The last time the Earth was 2 ¬∞C (3.6 ¬∞F) warmer than pre-industrial temperatures, sea levels were at least higher than now: this was when warming because of changes in the amount of sunlight due to slow changes in the Earth's orbit caused the last interglacial. The warming was sustained over a period of thousands of years and the magnitude of the rise in sea level implies a large contribution from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Also, a report by the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research stated that around three million years ago, levels of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere were similar to today's levels which increased temperature by two to three degrees Celsius and melted one third of Antarctica's ice sheets. This in turn caused sea-levels to rise 20 metres.Present CO2 levels caused 20-metre-sea-level rise in the past Since the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago, the sea level has risen by more than , with rates varying from less than a mm/year to 40+ mm/year, as a result of melting ice sheets over Canada and Eurasia. Rapid disintegration of ice sheets led to so called 'meltwater pulses', periods during which sea level rose rapidly. The rate of rise started to slow down about 8,200 years before present; the sea level was almost constant in the last 2,500 years, before the recent rising trend that started at the end of the 19th century or in the beginning of the 20th.  Sea level measurement  stripe graphic that assigns ranges of annual measurements to respective colors (link to image). For sea level change data, Jones cites Sea level changes can be driven either by variations in the amount of water in the oceans, the volume of the ocean or by changes of the land compared to the sea surface. The different techniques used to measure changes in sea level do not measure exactly the same level. Tide gauges can only measure relative sea level, whilst satellites can also measure absolute sea level changes. To get precise measurements for sea level, researchers studying the ice and the oceans on our planet factor in ongoing deformations of the solid Earth, in particular due to landmasses still rising from past ice masses retreating, and also the Earth's gravity and rotation. =Satellites= Jason-1 continued the sea surface measurements started by TOPEX/Poseidon. It was followed by the Ocean Surface Topography Mission on Jason-2, and by Jason-3 Since the launch of TOPEX/Poseidon in 1992, altimetric satellites have been recording the changes in sea level. Those satellites can measure the hills and valleys in the sea caused by currents and detect trends in their height. To measure the distance to the sea surface, the satellites send a microwave pulse to the ocean's surface and record the time it takes to return. Microwave radiometers correct the additional delay caused by water vapor in the atmosphere. Combining these data with the precisely known location of the spacecraft makes it possible to determine sea-surface height to within a few centimeters (about one inch). Current rates of sea level rise from satellite altimetry have been estimated to be per year for the period 1993‚Äì2017. Earlier satellite measurements were previously slightly at odds with tide gauge measurements. A small calibration error for the Topex/Poseidon satellite was eventually identified as having caused a slight overestimation of the 1992‚Äì2005 sea levels, that masked the ongoing sea level rise acceleration. Between 1993 and 2018, the mean sea level has risen across most of the world ocean (blue colors).Lindsey, Rebecca (2019) Climate Change: Global Sea Level NOAA Climate, 19 November 2019. Satellites are useful for measuring regional variations in sea level, such as the substantial rise between 1993 and 2012 in the western tropical Pacific. This sharp rise has been linked to increasing trade winds, which occur when the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) change from one state to the other. The PDO is a basin-wide climate pattern consisting of two phases, each commonly lasting 10 to 30 years, while the ENSO has a shorter period of 2 to 7 years. = Tide gauges = Another important source of sea- level observations is the global network of tide gauges. Compared to the satellite record, this record has major spatial gaps but covers a much longer period of time. Coverage of tide gauges started primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, with data for the Southern Hemisphere remaining scarce up to the 1970s. The longest running sea-level measurements, NAP or Amsterdam Ordnance Datum established in 1675, are recorded in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. In Australia record collection is also quite extensive, including measurements by an amateur meteorologist beginning in 1837 and measurements taken from a sea- level benchmark struck on a small cliff on the Isle of the Dead near the Port Arthur convict settlement in 1841. This network was used, in combination with satellite altimeter data, to establish that global mean sea-level rose between 1870 and 2004 at an average rate of about 1.44 mm/yr (1.7 mm/yr during the 20th century). Data collected by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia show the current global mean sea level trend to be per year, a doubling of the rate during the 20th century. This is an important confirmation of climate change simulations which predicted that sea level rise would accelerate in response to global warming. Some regional differences are also visible in the tide gauge data. Some of the recorded regional differences are due to differences in the actual sea level, while other are due to vertical land movements. In Europe for instance, considerable variation is found because some land areas are rising while others are sinking. Since 1970, most tidal stations have measured higher seas, but sea levels along the northern Baltic Sea have dropped due to post-glacial rebound. Contributions The Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica's largest, is about the size of France and up to several hundred metres thick. The three main reasons warming causes global sea level to rise are: oceans expand, ice sheets lose ice faster than it forms from snowfall, and glaciers at higher altitudes also melt. Sea level rise since the start of the 20th century has been dominated by retreat of glaciers and expansion of the ocean, but the contributions of the two large ice sheets (Greenland and Antarctica) are expected to increase in the 21st century. The ice sheets store most of the land ice (‚àº99.5%), with a sea-level equivalent (SLE) of for Greenland and for Antarctica. Each year about of precipitation (liquid equivalent) falls on the ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland, mostly as snow, which accumulates and over time forms glacial ice. Much of this precipitation began as water vapor evaporated from the ocean surface. Some of the snow is blown away by wind or disappears from the ice sheet by melt or by sublimation (directly changing into water vapor). The rest of the snow slowly changes into ice. This ice can flow to the edges of the ice sheet and return to the ocean by melting at the edge or in the form of icebergs. If precipitation, surface processes and ice loss at the edge balance each other, sea level remains the same. However scientists have found that ice is being lost, and at an accelerating rate. = Ocean heating = left Most of the additional heat trapped in the Earth's climate system by global warming is stored in oceans. They store more than 90% of the extra heat and act as a buffer against the effects of global warming. The heat needed to raise an average temperature increase of the entire world ocean by 0.01 ¬∞C would increase the atmospheric temperature by approximately 10 ¬∞C .Levitus, S., Boyer, T., Antonov, J., Garcia, H., and Locarnini, R. (2005) Poster presented at the U.S. Climate Change Science Program Workshop, 14‚Äì16 November 2005, Arlington VA, Climate Science in Support of Decision- Making; Last viewed 22 May 2009. Thus, a small change in the mean temperature of the ocean represents a very large change in the total heat content of the climate system. When the ocean gains heat, the water expands and sea level rises. The amount of expansion varies with both water temperature and pressure. For each degree, warmer water and water under great pressure (due to depth) expand more than cooler water and water under less pressure. This means that cold Arctic Ocean water will expand less compared to warm tropical water. Because different climate models have slightly different patterns of ocean heating, they do not agree fully on the predictions for the contribution of ocean heating on sea level rise. Heat gets transported into deeper parts of the ocean by winds and currents, and some of it reaches depths of more than . =Antarctica= Processes around an Antarctic ice shelf The large volume of ice on the Antarctic continent stores around 70% of the world's fresh water. The Antarctic ice sheet mass balance is affected by snowfall accumulations, and ice discharge along the periphery. Under the influence of global warming, melt at the base of the ice sheet increases. Simultaneously, the capacity of the atmosphere to carry precipitation increases with temperature so that precipitation, in the form of snowfall, increases in global and regional models. The additional snowfall causes increased ice flow of the ice sheet into the ocean, so that the mass gain due to snowfall is partially compensated. Snowfall increased over the last two centuries, but no increase was found in the interior of Antarctica over the last four decades. Based on changes of Antarctica's ice mass balance over millions of years, due to natural climate fluctuations, researchers concluded that the sea-ice acts as a barrier for warmer waters surrounding the continent. Consequently, the loss of sea ice is a major driver of the instability of the entire ice sheet. Different satellite methods for measuring ice mass and change are in good agreement, and combining methods leads to more certainty about how the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and the Antarctic Peninsula evolve. A 2018 systematic review study estimated that ice loss across the entire continent was 43 gigatons (Gt) per year on average during the period from 1992 to 2002, but has accelerated to an average of 220 Gt per year during the five years from 2012 to 2017. Most of the melt comes from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, but the Antarctic Peninsula and East Antarctic Ice Sheet also contribute. The sea-level rise due to Antarctica has been estimated to be 0.25 mm per year from 1993‚Äì2005, and 0.42 mm per year from 2005 to 2015. All datasets generally show an acceleration of mass loss from the Antarctic ice- sheet, but with year-to-year variations. East Antarctica The world's largest potential source of sea level rise is the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, which holds enough ice to raise global sea levels by . The ice sheet has historically been considered to be relatively stable and has therefore attracted less scientific attention and observations compared to West Antarctica. A combination of satellite observations of its changing volume, flow and gravitational attraction with modelling of its surface mass balance suggests the overall mass balance of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet was relatively steady or slightly positive for much of the period 1992‚Äì2017. A 2019 study, however, using different methodology, concluded that East Antarctica is losing significant amounts of ice mass. The lead scientist Eric Rignot told CNN: \\"melting is taking place in the most vulnerable parts of Antarctica ... parts that hold the potential for multiple meters of sea level rise in the coming century or two.\\" Methods agree that the Totten Glacier has lost ice in recent decades in response to ocean warming and possibly a reduction in local sea ice cover. Totten Glacier is the primary outlet of the Aurora Subglacial Basin, a major ice reservoir in East Antarctica that could rapidly retreat due to hydrological processes. The global sea level potential of flowing through Totten Glacier alone is of similar magnitude to the entire probable contribution of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The other major ice reservoir on East Antarctica that might rapidly retreat is the Wilkes Basin which is subject to marine ice sheet instability. Ice loss from these outlet glaciers is possibly compensated by accumulation gains in other parts of Antarctica. West Antarctica A graphical representation of how warm waters, and the Marine Ice Sheet Instability and Marine Ice Cliff Instability processes are affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Even though East Antarctica contains the largest potential source of sea level rise, it is West Antarctica that currently experiences a net outflow of ice, causing sea levels to rise. Using different satellites from 1992 to 2017 shows melt is increasing significantly over this period. Antarctica as a whole has caused a total of of sea level rise. Considering the mass balance of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet which was relatively steady, the major contributor was West Antarctica. Significant acceleration of outflow glaciers in the Amundsen Sea Embayment may have contributed to this increase. In contrast to East Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula, temperatures on West Antarctica have increased significantly with a trend between 0.08 ¬∞C (0.14 ¬∞F) per decade and 0.96 ¬∞C (1.7 ¬∞F) per decade between 1976 and 2012. Multiple types of instability are at play in West Antarctica. One is the Marine Ice Sheet Instability, where the bedrock on which parts of the ice sheet rest is deeper inland. This means that when a part of the ice sheet melts, a thicker part of the ice sheet is exposed to the ocean, which may lead to additional ice loss. Secondly, melting of the ice shelves, the floating extensions of the ice sheet, leads to a process named the Marine Ice Cliff Instability. Because they function as a buttress to the ice sheet, their melt leads to additional ice flow (see animation one minute into video). Melt of ice shelves is accelerated when surface melt creates crevasses and these crevasses cause fracturing. The Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers have been identified to be potentially prone to these processes, since both glaciers bedrock topography gets deeper farther inland, exposing them to more warm water intrusion at the grounding line. With continued melt and retreat they contribute to raising global sea levels. The melting of these 2 glaciers had accelerated at the beginning of the 21th century. It can destabilize the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet. However, the process will probably not be finished in this century. Most of the bedrock underlying the West Antarctic Ice Sheet lies well below sea level. A rapid collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could raise sea level by . = Greenland = Greenland 2007 melt anomaly, measured as the difference between the number of days on which melting occurred in 2007 compared to the average annual melting days from 1988‚Äì2006 Most ice on Greenland is part of the Greenland ice sheet which is at its thickest. The rest of the ice on Greenland is part of isolated glaciers and ice caps. The sources contributing to sea level rise from Greenland are from ice sheet melting (70%) and from glacier calving (30%). Dust, soot, and microbes and algae living on parts of the ice sheet further enhance melting by darkening its surface and thus absorbing more thermal radiation; these regions grew by 12% between 2000 and 2012, and are likely to expand further. Average annual ice loss in Greenland more than doubled in the early 21st century compared to the 20th century. Some of Greenland's largest outlet glaciers, such as Jakobshavn Isbr√¶ and Kangerlussuaq Glacier, are flowing faster into the ocean. A study published in 2017 concluded that Greenland's peripheral glaciers and ice caps crossed an irreversible tipping point around 1997, and will continue to melt. The Greenland ice sheet and its glaciers and ice caps are the largest contributor to sea level rise from land ice sources (excluding thermal expansion), combined accounting for 71 percent, or 1.32 mm per year during the 2012‚Äì2016 period. A study published in 2020 estimated that the Greenland Ice Sheet had lost a total of 3,902 gigatons (Gt) of ice between 1992 and 2018, corresponding to a contribution to sea level rise of 10.8 mm. The sea-level rise due to the Greenland Ice Sheet has generally increased over time, rising from 0.07 mm per year between 1992 and 1997 to 0.68 mm per year between 2012 and 2017. According to another study, in the years 2002 - 2019 Greenland lost 4,550 gigaton of ice, 268 gigaton per year, on average. In 2019 Greenland lost 600 gigaton of ice in two months contributing 2.2 mm to global sea level rise Estimates on future contribution to sea level rise from Greenland range from , for the year 2100. By the end of the century, it can contribute 2-10 centimetres annually. The contribution of the Greenland ice sheet on sea level over the next couple of centuries can be very high due to a self-reinforcing cycle (a so-called positive feedback). After an initial period of melting, the height of the ice sheet will have lowered. As air temperature increases closer to the sea surface, more melt starts to occur. This melting may further be accelerated because the color of ice is darker while it is melting. There is a threshold in surface warming beyond which a partial or near-complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet occurs. Different research has put this threshold value as low as 1 ¬∞C (2 ‚Ñâ), and definitely 4 ¬∞C (7 ‚Ñâ), above pre-industrial temperatures. =Glaciers= Less than 1% of glacier ice is in mountain glaciers, compared to 99% in Greenland and Antarctica. Still, mountain glaciers have contributed appreciably to historical sea level rise and are set to contribute a smaller, but still significant fraction of sea level rise in the 21st century. The roughly 200,000 glaciers on earth are spread out across all continents. Different glaciers respond differently to increasing temperatures. For instance, valley glaciers that have a shallow slope retreat under even mild warming. Every glacier has a height above which there is net gain in mass and under which the glacier loses mass. If that height changes a bit, this has large consequences for glaciers with a shallow slope. Many glaciers drain into the ocean and ice loss can therefore increase when ocean temperatures increase. Observational and modelling studies of mass loss from glaciers and ice caps indicate a contribution to sea-level rise of 0.2-0.4 mm per year, averaged over the 20th century. Over the 21st century, this is expected to rise, with glaciers contributing to global sea levels. Glaciers contributed around 40% to sea-level rise during the 20th century, with estimates for the 21st century of around 30%. = Sea ice = Sea ice melt contributes very slightly to global sea level rise. If the melt water from ice floating in the sea was exactly the same as sea water then, according to Archimedes' principle, no rise would occur. However melted sea ice contains less dissolved salt than sea water and is therefore less dense: in other words although the melted sea ice weighs the same as the sea water it was displacing when it was ice, its volume is still slightly greater. If all floating ice shelves and icebergs were to melt sea level would only rise by about . = Land water storage = GRACE observations in gigatons per year, April 2002 to November 2014 (glaciers and ice sheets are excluded). Humans impact how much water is stored on land. Building dams prevents large masses of water from flowing into the sea and therefore increases the storage of water on land. On the other hand, humans extract water from lakes, wetlands and underground reservoirs for food production leading to rising seas. Furthermore, the hydrological cycle is influenced by climate change and deforestation, which can lead to further positive and negative contributions to sea level rise. In the 20th century, these processes roughly balanced, but dam building has slowed down and is expected to stay low for the 21st century.  Projections  This graph shows the minimum projected change in global sea level rise if atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations were to either quadruple or double. The projection is based on several multi-century integrations of a GFDL global coupled ocean-atmosphere model. These projections are the expected changes due to thermal expansion of sea water alone, and do not include the effect of melted continental ice sheets. With the effect of ice sheets included the total rise will be larger, by an uncertain but possibly substantial factor. Image credit: NOAA GFDL. Different sea level rise projections for the 21st century There are broadly two ways of modelling sea level rise and making future projections. On the one hand, scientists use process-based modelling, where all relevant and well-understood physical processes are included in a physical model. An ice-sheet model is used to calculate the contributions of ice sheets and a general circulation model is used to compute the rising sea temperature and its expansion. A disadvantage of this method is that not all relevant processes might be understood to a sufficient level. Alternatively, some scientists use semi-empirical techniques that use geological data from the past to determine likely sea level responses to a warming world in addition to some basic physical modelling. Semi- empirical sea level models rely on statistical techniques, using relationships between observed (contributions to) global mean sea level and global mean temperature. This type of modelling was partially motivated by the fact that in previous literature assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) most physical models underestimated the amount of sea level rise compared to observations of the 20th century. = Projections for the 21st century = In its fifth assessment report (2013) the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated how much sea level is likely to rise in the 21st century based on different levels of greenhouse gas emissions. These projections are based on well-known factors which contribute to sea level rise, but exclude other processes which are less well understood. If countries make rapid cuts to emissions (the RCP2.6 scenario), the IPCC deems it likely that the sea level will rise by with a 67% confidence interval. If emissions remain very high, the IPCC projects sea level will rise by . In August 2020 scientists reported that observed ice-sheet losses in Greenland and Antarctica track worst case scenarios of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report's sea-level rise projections. Since the publication of the 2013 IPCC assessment, attempts have been made to include more physical processes and to develop models that can project sea level rise using paleoclimate data. This typically led to higher estimates of sea level rise. For instance, a 2016 study led by Jim Hansen concluded that based on past climate change data, sea level rise could accelerate exponentially in the coming decades, with a doubling time of 10, 20 or 40 years, respectively, raising the ocean by several meters in 50, 100 or 200 years. However, Greg Holland from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who reviewed the study, noted: ‚ÄúThere is no doubt that the sea level rise, within the IPCC, is a very conservative number, so the truth lies somewhere between IPCC and Jim.‚Äù In addition, one 2017 study's scenario, assuming high fossil fuel use for combustion and strong economic growth during this century, projects sea level rise of up to on average ‚Äî and an extreme scenario with as much as , by 2100. This could mean rapid sea level rise of up to per year by the end of the century. The study also concluded that the Paris climate agreement emissions scenario, if met, would result in a median of sea level rise by 2100. According to the Fourth (2017) National Climate Assessment (NCA) of the United States it is very likely sea level will rise between 30 and 130 cm (1.0‚Äì4.3 feet) in 2100 compared to the year 2000. A rise of 2.4 m (8 feet) is physically possible under a high emission scenario but the authors were unable to say how likely. This worst-case scenario can only come about with a large contribution from Antarctica; a region that is difficult to model. The possibility of a collapse of the West-Antarctic ice sheet and subsequent rapid sea level rise was suggested back in the 1970s. For instance, Mercer published a study in 1978 predicting that anthropogenic carbon dioxide warming and its potential effects on climate in the 21st century could cause a sea level rise of around from melting of the West Antarctic ice-sheet alone. In 2019, a study projected that in low emission scenario, sea level will rise 30 centimeters by 2050 and 69 centimetres by 2100, relatively to the level in 2000. In high emission scenario, it will be 34 cm by 2050 and 111 cm by 2100. There is the probability that the rise will be beyond 2 metres by 2100 in the high emission scenario, which will cause displacement of 187 million people. In September 2019 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a report about the impact of climate change on the oceans including sea level rise. The main idea in the report according to one of his authors Michael Oppenheimer is that if humanity will drastically reduce Greenhouse gas emission in the next decades the problem will be tough but manageable. If the rise in emission will continue the problem will become unmanageable. = Long- term sea level rise = Map of the Earth with a long-term sea level rise represented in red (uniform distribution, actual sea level rise will vary regionally). There is a widespread consensus among climate scientists that substantial long-term sea-level rise will continue for centuries to come even if the temperature stabilizes. Models are able to reproduce paleo records of sea level rise, which provides confidence in their application to long-term future change. Both the Greenland ice sheet and Antarctica have tipping points for warming levels that could be reached before the end of the 21st century. Crossing such tipping points means that ice-sheet changes are potentially irreversible: a decrease to pre-industrial temperatures may not stabilize the ice sheet once the tipping point has been crossed. Quantifying the exact temperature change for which this tipping point is crossed remains controversial. For Greenland, estimates roughly range between 1 and 4 ¬∞C (2 to 7 ‚Ñâ) above pre-industrial. The lower of these values has already been passed. Melting of the Greenland ice sheet could contribute an additional over many thousands of years. A 2013 study estimated that there is a commitment to sea level rise for each degree of temperature rise within the next 2,000 years. More recent research, especially into Antarctica, indicates that this is probably a conservative estimate and true long-term sea level rise might be higher. Warming beyond the 2 ¬∞C (3.6 ¬∞F) target potentially lead to rates of sea-level rise dominated by ice loss from Antarctica. Continued carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel sources could cause additional tens of metres of sea level rise, over the next millennia, and the available fossil fuel on Earth is even enough to ultimately melt the entire Antarctic ice sheet, causing about of sea level rise. After 500 years, sea level rise from thermal expansion alone may have reached only half of its eventual level, which models suggest may lie within ranges of .  Regional sea level change  Sea level rise is not uniform around the globe. Some land masses are moving up or down as a consequence of subsidence (land sinking or settling) or post-glacial rebound (land rising due to the loss of the weight of ice after melting), so that local relative sea level rise may be higher or lower than the global average. There are even regions near current and former glaciers and ice sheets where sea level falls. Furthermore, gravitational effects of changing ice masses and spatially varying patterns of warming lead to differences in the distribution of sea water around the globe. The gravitational effects comes into play when a large ice sheet melts. With the loss of mass, the gravitational pull becomes less and local water levels might drop. Further away from the ice sheet water levels will increase more than average. In this light, melt in Greenland has a different fingerprint on regional sea level than melt in Antarctica. Many ports, urban conglomerations, and agricultural regions are built on river deltas, where subsidence of land contributes to a substantially increased relative sea level rise. This is caused by both unsustainable extraction of groundwater (in some places also by extraction of oil and gas), and by levees and other flood management practices that prevent accumulation of sediments from compensating for the natural settling of deltaic soils.; Total human-caused subsidence in the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta (Netherlands) is estimated at , over in urban areas of the Mississippi River Delta (New Orleans), and over in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Isostatic rebound causes relative sea level fall around the Hudson Bay in Canada and the northern Baltic. The Atlantic is set to warm at a faster pace than the Pacific. This has consequences for Europe and the U.S. East Coast, which received a sea level rise 3‚Äì4 times the global average. The downturn of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) has been also tied to extreme regional sea level rise on the US Northeast Coast.  Effects  Current and future sea level rise is set to have a number of impacts, particularly on coastal systems. Such impacts include increased coastal erosion, higher storm-surge flooding, inhibition of primary production processes, more extensive coastal inundation, changes in surface water quality and groundwater characteristics, increased loss of property and coastal habitats, increased flood risk and potential loss of life, loss of non- monetary cultural resources and values, impacts on agriculture and aquaculture through decline in soil and water quality, and loss of tourism, recreation, and transportation functions.. Many of these impacts are detrimental. Owing to the great diversity of coastal environments; regional and local differences in projected relative sea level and climate changes; and differences in the resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems, sectors, and countries, the impacts will be highly variable in time and space. River deltas in Africa and Asia and small island states are particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise. Globally tens of millions of people will be displaced in the latter decades of the century if greenhouse gases are not reduced drastically. Many coastal areas have large population growth, which results in more people at risk from sea level rise. The rising seas pose both a direct risk: unprotected homes can be flooded, and indirect threats of higher storm surges, tsunamis and king tides. Asia has the largest population at risk from sea level with countries such as Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam having very densely populated coastal areas. The effects of displacement are very dependent on how successful governments will be in implementing defenses against the rising sea, with concerns for the poorest countries such as sub-Saharan countries and island nations. In October 2019 a study was published in the journal Nature Communications, saying that the number of people who will be impacted from sea level rise during 21 century is 3 times higher that was previously thought. By the year 2050, 150 million will be under the water line during high tide and 300 million will live in zones with floodings every year. By the year 2100, those numbers differ sharply depending on the emission scenario. In a low emission scenario, 140 million will be under water during high tide and 280 million will have flooding each year. In high emission scenario, the numbers arrive to 540 million and 640 million respectively. 70% of these people will live in 8 countries in Asia: China, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, Philippines. Several days after, United Nations Secretary General Ant√≥nio Guterres cited the report calling to Asian countries to implement a carbon tax, stop building new coal plants and stop subsidies to fossil fuels =Coastal areas= Tidal flooding in Miami during a king tide (October 17, 2016). The risk of tidal flooding increases with sea level rise. Due to numerous factors, sea levels are rising at an accelerating rate, which poses a great threat to the human environment, both now and in the future. Although this is a slow and continuous process, its long-term cumulative effects on the world, especially in coastal areas, pose a serious threat. In recent years, some coastal areas have already had to cope with effects accumulated over a long period of change. These areas are sensitive to rising sea levels, changes in the frequency and intensity of storms, increased precipitation, and rising ocean temperatures. Ten per cent of the world's population live in coastal areas that are less than above sea level. Furthermore, two thirds of the world's cities with over five million people are located in these low-lying coastal areas. In total, approximately 600 million people live directly on the coast around the world.  Present effects  Rising seas has also been tied to an increased risk from tsunamis, potentially affecting coastal cities in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. One of the areas in danger is Venice. The city is located in the delta of the Po and Piave rivers on the islands. Sea level rise causes an increase in frequency and magnitude of floodings in the city that already spent more than $6 billion on the flood barrier system. While some special measures have been taken in coastal areas to deal with the effects of storm surges, not much has been done to deal with the increased storm surges caused by rising sea levels. Food production in coastal areas is affected by rising sea levels as well. Due to flooding and salt water intrusion into the soil, the salinity of agricultural lands near the sea increases, posing problems for crops that are not salt-resistant. Furthermore, salt intrusion in fresh irrigation water poses a second problem for crops that are irrigated. Newly developed salt- resistant crop variants are currently more expensive than the crops they are set to replace. The farmland in the Nile Delta is affected by salt water flooding, and there is now more salt in the soil and irrigation water in the Red River Delta and the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. Bangladesh and China are affected in a similar way, particularly their rice production.  Future effects  Major cities threatened by sea level rise. The cities indicated are under threat of even a small sea level rise (of 1.6 foot/49 cm) compared to the level in 2010. Even moderate projections indicate that such a rise will have occurred by 2060.:File:Projections of global mean sea level rise by Parris et al. (2012).pngSea level rise chart Future sea level rise could lead to potentially catastrophic difficulties for shore-based communities in the next centuries: for example, millions of people will be affected in cities such as Miami, Rio de Janeiro, Osaka and Shanghai if following the current trajectory of 3 ¬∞C (5.4 ¬∞F). The Egyptian city Alexandria faces a similar situation, where hundreds of thousands of people living in the low-lying areas may already have to be relocated in the coming decade. However, modest increases in sea level are likely to be offset when cities adapt by constructing sea walls or through relocating. Miami has been listed as \\"the number-one most vulnerable city worldwide\\" in terms of potential damage to property from storm-related flooding and sea-level rise. Storm surge will be one of the important disasters caused by sea level rise in the future that can cause the largest loss of life and property in the world's coastal areas. Storm surges have been affected in recent years by rising sea levels, which have increased in frequency and intensity. For example, one of the most severely affected areas is New York City, where study simulations show that the impact of sea level rise on the New York area will be reduced from 100-year flooding to 19‚Äì68 years by 2050 and 40‚Äì60 years by 2080. = Island nations = Atolls and low-lying coastal areas on islands are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise. Possible impacts include coastal erosion, flooding and salt intrusion into soils and freshwater. It is difficult to assess how much of past erosion and floods have been caused by sea level change, compared to other environmental events such as hurricanes. Adaptation to sea level rise is costly for small island nations as a large portion of their population lives in areas that are at risk. Maldives, Tuvalu, and other low-lying countries are among the areas that are at the highest level of risk. At current rates, sea level would be high enough to make the Maldives uninhabitable by 2100. Geomorphological events such as storms tend to have larger impacts on reef island than sea level rise, for instance at one of the Marshall Islands. These effects include the immediate erosion and subsequent regrowth process that may vary in length from decades to centuries, even resulting in land areas larger than pre-storm values. With an expected rise in the frequency and intensity of storms, they may become more significant in determining island shape and size than sea level rise. The Island nation of Fiji is being impacted by sea level rise.\\"Vanua in the Anthropocene: Relationality and Sea Level Rise in Fiji\\" by Maebh Long, Symploke (2018), 26(1-2), 51-70. Five of the Solomon Islands have disappeared due to the combined effects of sea level rise and stronger trade winds that were pushing water into the Western Pacific. In the case all islands of an island nation become uninhabitable or completely submerged by the sea, the states themselves would also become dissolved. Once this happens, all rights on the surrounding area (sea) are removed. This area can be significant as rights extend to a radius of around the entire island state. Any resources, such as fossil oil, minerals and metals, within this area can be freely dug up by anyone and sold without needing to pay any commission to the (now dissolved) island state. =Ecosystems= Bramble cay, where it had been endemic, and likely also globally extinct, with habitat loss due to sea level rise being the root cause. Coastal ecosystems are facing drastic changes as a consequence of rising sea levels. Many systems might ultimately be lost when sea levels rise too much or too fast. Some ecosystems can move land inward with the high-water mark, but many are prevented from migrating due to natural or artificial barriers. This coastal narrowing, sometimes called 'coastal squeeze' when considering human-made barriers, could result in the loss of habitats such as mudflats and marshes. The mangrove ecosystem is one of these iconic ecosystems affected by rising sea levels. It is an ecological whole composed of mangrove plants growing in and around the mudflats of the tropical coast. Its ecological value is important because it is an ideal home for living things, and more importantly, it is a natural coastal shelterbelt. However, the rate of sea level rise has accelerated in the last few years, and even if mangroves can withstand certain waves, their ecosystems will inevitably be affected over time. In recent years, mangroves have been moving inland, but their success depends on various environmental information such as topography and geology. So there are a lot of preconditions for a mangrove forest to migrate successfully. Mangroves and tidal marshes adjust to rising sea levels by building vertically using accumulated sediment and organic matter. If sea level rise is too rapid, they will not be able to keep up and will instead be submerged. More specifically, if the rate of mangrove deposition does not keep up with sea level rise, the key to the extinction of the mangrove ecosystem is the relationship between the rate of inland migration and the rate of sea level rise. If sea levels rise faster than the mangroves can move to land, this can lead to the loss of ecosystems. The ability of mangroves to survive sea-level rise events depend on their ability to migrate inland. As both ecosystems protect against storm surges, waves and tsunamis, losing them makes the effects of sea level rise worse. Human activities, such as dam building, may restrict sediment supplies to wetlands, and thereby prevent natural adaptation processes. The loss of some tidal marshes is unavoidable as a consequence. When seawater reaches inland, problems related to contaminated soils may occur. Also, fish, birds, and coastal plants could lose parts of their habitat. Coral, important for bird and fish life, needs to grow vertically to remain close to the sea surface in order to get enough energy from sunlight. It has so far been able to keep up the vertical growth with the rising seas, but might not be able to do so in the future. In 2016, it was reported that the Bramble Cay melomys, which lived on a Great Barrier Reef island, had probably become extinct because of inundation due to sea level rises. This report was confirmed by the federal government of Australia when it declared the Bramble Cay melomys extinct as of February 2019, making this species the first known mammal to go extinct as a result of sea level rise. Adaptation Placard \\"The sea is rising\\", at the leftAdaptation options to sea level rise can be broadly classified into retreat, accommodate and protect. Retreating is moving people and infrastructure to less exposed areas and preventing further development in areas that are at risk. This type of adaptation is potentially disruptive, as displacement of people might lead to tensions. Accommodation options are measurements that make societies more flexible to sea level rise. Examples are the cultivation of food crops that tolerate a high salt content in the soil and making new building standards which require building to be built higher and have less damage in the case a flood does occur. Finally, areas can be protected by the construction of dams, dikes and by improving natural defenses. In more detail, the existing problems people are facing are divided into two parts: one is water pollution, and the other is storm surges and floods. In the United States, the environmental protection agency supports the development and maintenance of water supply infrastructure nationwide, especially in coastal cities, and more coastal cities and countries are actively implementing this approach. Besides, storm surges and flooding can be instantaneous and devastating to cities, and some coastal areas have begun investing in storm water valves to cope with more frequent and severe flooding during high tides. These adaptation options can be further divided into hard and soft. Hard adaptation relies mostly on capital-intensive human-built infrastructure and involves large-scale changes to human societies and ecological systems. Because of its large scale, it is often not flexible. Soft adaptation involves strengthening natural defenses and adaptation strategies in local communities and the use of simple and modular technology, which can be locally owned. The two types of adaptation might be complementary or mutually exclusive. Beach nourishment in progress in Barcelona. Many countries are developing concrete plans for adaptation. An example is the extension of the Delta Works in the Netherlands, a country that sits partially below sea level and is subsiding. In 2008, the Dutch Delta Commission, advised in a report that the Netherlands would need a massive new building program to strengthen the country's water defenses against the anticipated effects of global warming for the following 190 years. This included drawing up worst-case plans for evacuations. The plan also included more than ‚Ç¨100 billion (US$ billion) in new spending through to the year 2100 to implement precautionary measures, such as broadening coastal dunes and strengthening sea and river dikes. The commission said the country must plan for a rise in the North Sea up to by 2100 and plan for a m rise by 2200. Miami Beach is spending $500 million from 2015 to 2020 to address sea-level rise. Actions include a pump drainage system, and raising of roadways and sidewalks. U.S. coastal cities also conduct so called beach nourishment, also known as beach replenishment, where mined sand is trucked in and added, although other adaptation measures such as zoning, restrictions on state funding, and building code standards are also utilized. Some island nations, such as the Republic of Maldives, Kiribati and Tuvalu are considering international migration of their population in response to rising seas. Moving to different countries is not an easy solution, as those who move need to have a steady income and social network in their new country. It might be easier to adapt locally by moving further inland and increasing sediment supply needed for natural erosion protection. In the island nation of Fiji, residents are restoring coral reefs and mangroves to protect themselves against flooding and erosion, which is estimated to be more cost-efficient than building sea-walls. In 2019, the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, declared that the city of Jakarta is sinking to a degree that requires him to move the capital to another city. A study conducted between 1982 and 2010 found that some areas of Jakarta have been sinking by as much as 28 cm (11 inches) per year due to ground water drilling and the weight of its buildings, and the problem is now exacerbated by sea level rise. However, there are concerns that building in a new location will increase tropical deforestation. Other threatened cities include Lagos, Nigeria and the U.S. cities of Houston, Texas; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Washington, D.C..

Distribution This species is native to Chile and New Zealand. Also, a self-sustaining population in the Menai Strait was deliberately introduced from the Fisheries Laboratory, Conwy, during the 1960s as an experiment to establish if they could form an alternative to the native oysters Ostrea edulis in fisheries, when the species was shown to be unsuitable because of low recruitment and vulnerability to parasites and pathogens the experiment was abandoned. O. chilensis has now spread to other areas of the Menai Strait and is regarded as an invasive species. Habitat This bivalve is found from low tide to depths of up to 35 m. Description Its length is up to 105 mm, width up to 70 mm, and inflation up to 33 mm. Commercial importance Bluff oysters at a restaurant In New Zealand, they are a prized delicacy, and harvested from March to August from the Foveaux Strait oyster fishery, which centres on the town of Bluff (hence the local name). From the early 1980s, the fishery went into serious decline, due to the outbreak of an oyster parasite, Bonamia exitiosa, with the disease killing an estimated billion oysters between 2000 and 2003. The population has been recovering since 2003, with fishermen voluntarily limiting the catch to half the allowable to aid the revival.H.J. Cranfield, A. Dunn, I.J. Doonan and K.P. Michael 2005.

M. Stirling, set after the events of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, and first published in May 2001, which makes them the first works to officially continue the franchise. The series consists of three novels: T2: Infiltrator (2001),WorldCat title entry T2: Rising Storm (2003),WorldCat title entry and T2: The Future War (2004).WorldCat title entry Plot overview =T2: Infiltrator (2001)= T2: Infiltrator explores Sarah and John's life while living off the grid. Set six years after the events of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Sarah and 16-year-old John live a relatively normal life under the assumed names John and Suzanne Krieger near a small town in Paraguay, believing they have destroyed Cyberdyne Systems for good and prevented the creation of Skynet. They own a successful trucking company known as Krieger Trucking, while also being proficient smugglers. Sarah works at the company, while John attends military school, quickly becoming one of their best students, gaining military skills, weaponry and hacking knowledge. They gain a new neighbor in Dieter von Rossbach, a former Austrian counterterrorism operative and future model for the T-800 series. He is drawn to the Connors, and after Sarah tells him about the future war, they are attacked by a new T-800, created in the present by a new Terminator model, the i-950 Infiltrator Serena Burns. Realizing that Judgment Day was not permanently averted, they attempt once again to stop Skynet's creation with the help of Dieter. They eventually run into FBI agent Jordan Dyson, Miles Dyson's brother who is looking to capture the Connors for his brother's death and Cyberdyne's destruction, but witnesses the Terminators himself and comes to believe them and decides to help them destroy Cyberdyne's most recent facility and the remaining Terminators. Sarah is fatally wounded by Serena as she destroys her, while Dyson looks after her and makes sure she makes a full recovery. John and Dieter flea to Paraguay once again. Dyson, however, finds out that Cyberdyne has a back-up facility located in Montana and immediately informs them of this information. =T2: Rising Storm (2003)= Set a few months after the events of the previous novel, T2: Rising Storm shows John and Dieter starting up the foundations of the future Resistance. John traces possible recruits all over the internet, while Dieter secures weaponry and supplies to live through the coming Judgment Day. Dieter has been chosen as John's guardian by Sarah while she recovers from her wounds, becoming Sarah's most trusted asset. She is taken back to Pescadero State Hospital and is transferred to a halfway house by Dr. Silberman. After having seen the T-800 and the T-1000 himself seven years previously, Silberman has come to believe Sarah's story. When an undercover Terminator is watching over the recovering Sarah, Silberman helps her flea across the border so she can make it back to Paraguay, making amends for his previous treatment of her. Sarah stays at Dieter's house, while Dieter and John head to Cyberdyne's back- up site in Monatana alongside Wendy Dorset, John's new girlfriend and the Resistance's first recruit. They come to the conclusion that no matter how far Skynet's creation is delayed, it will seemingly always become sentient. John and Wendy design an A.I. virus which prevents it from ever becoming sentient. While Wendy is subdued by Serena Burns' first i-950 clone, Clea Bennet, John mistakenly uploads the wrong program into Skynet's programming and Wendy is killed. A distraught John destroys Clea Bennet alongside Dieter, who end up fleeing the military base. As they head back to Paraguay, John feels like the entire journey was in vain, with he himself being responsible for Skynet's eventual sentience. Meanwhile, Sarah has been attacked by Serena's second clone, Alissa, managing to destroy it and preventing it from succeeding in its mission. Skynet, however, becomes sentient and starts its process of eradicating humanity. =T2: The Future War (2004)= T2: The Future War shows the destruction Skynet causes around the world and its killing of 3 billion lives. Skynet creates machines to track and kill the remaining humans. John has become the leader of the Resistance, with Sarah and Dieter having fallen in love and married. The life between the parents of John's eventual father Kyle Reese is explored, with Kyle being born, being captured by a patrol unit as a child and forced to work in a Skynet work camp. The work camp is liberated by John and his Tech-Com unit, freeing Kyle and the other prisoners, while Kyle's parents are killed. John assigns his friend Jack Brock to protect Kyle, as well as becoming his foster father. He grows up fighting alongside John and his Tech-Com unit. In 2029, as the Resistance is about to destroy Skynet's defence grid, as a last ditch effort in winning the war it sends back a T-800 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor, a T-1000 to 1995 to kill a 10-year-old John Connor, and the i-950 unit Serena Burns to 2001 to kill the Connors and ensure Skynet's creation. Once John finds out about this, he sends the volunteering Kyle back to protect Sarah from the T-800 and a reprogrammed T-800 to protect his younger self from the T-1000. Afterwards, Skynet is effectively destroyed and John is greeted by Sarah, Dieter and the remaining Resistance members as they are relieved that the great ordeal is finally over. I-950 Unlike the T series Terminators, the I series are not factory built machines. Skynet decided that the best way for one of its terminators to act human was to start out with a human and add technological enhancements where necessary. The I-950 starts out as a baby with a neural net processor attached to its brain, providing an up-link to Skynet. To condition it physically, it is coaxed with holographic toys to crawl until it is exhausted. After four years, it is given an injection that rapidly ages it to maturity to finish its training. In an effort to blend in better with humans, the I-950 is allowed to feel emotions, but the range is limited by one of its cybernetic implants. Because it is far more human than machine, dogs are not alerted to its presence, and the infiltrator can go undetected for extremely long periods of time inside a resistance base. The I-950s carry Model 101 CPU's in case they are needed, as well as power cells. Once the \\"living\\" portion of the I-950 is dead, the CPU then takes control of the body, but can only do so for a short time. They can reproduce with other I-950s but not humans. If the female I-950 decides that the pregnancy would stop them from carrying out their mission, they could fertilize their eggs in vitro and would be implanted in human surrogate wombs. They are also able to clone themselves.

He is also Sarah Connor's eventual love interest and husband therefore becomes John Connor's stepfather. * Serena Burns: The I-950 Infiltrator unit sent back to the present to kill the Connors and secure the birth of Skynet. * Jordan Dyson: The brother of Miles Dyson and an FBI agent, obsessed with finding out the facts of his brother's death and bringing Sarah Connor and John Connor to justice, before he witnesses the I-950 and the Terminators in action and learns the truth about them.

(TSI) (later TeleSensory Corporation) was an American corporation that invented, designed, manufactured, and distributed technological aids for blind and low vision persons. TSI's products helped visually impaired people work independently with computers and with ordinary printed materials.  History  The Optacon, TSI's first product, was conceived by Electrical Engineering Professor John G. Linvill as a means for his blind daughter, Candy, to read ordinary print. The Optacon development, led by James C. Bliss, involved dozens of engineers and scientists at Stanford University and at Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) starting in 1962. Following the successful demonstration of a functional prototype in 1969, TSI was founded in 1970 in Palo Alto, California, USA. TSI developed a line of products for blind people during the 1970s, and expanded into the low vision field in 1984. TSI's products for blind people employed either tactile or auditory means of conveying information; its low vision products increased the size and contrast of printed material or computer screen images. Some TSI products consisted of software only, but most also needed custom electronics hardware. For thirty-five years TSI provided electronic assistive devices to visually impaired persons worldwide. Concurrently computer technology improved and computer operating systems began to incorporate accessibility options such as speech screen readers or magnification for no cost. Having changed its name to \\"TeleSensory\\", the company shifted its focus to low visions products and stopped manufacturing blindness products in the early 1990s. In March, 2005, TeleSensory, the former TSI, abruptly declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy and all its employees were escorted from the building. In August, 2005, InSiPhil (S) Pte Ltd. of Singapore purchased TeleSensory's intellectual property and remaining assets and resumed production of some of the low vision products under the name and logo of TeleSensory.

Its motto, \\"One Community, One Family\\", has been its cornerstone since 2001. The neighborhood is encompassed in the 30314 zip code. Hunter Hills shares borders with Mozley Park, Dixie Hills and West Lake neighborhoods. The neighborhood rests just inside Atlanta's perimeter highway I-285, and U.S. Route 78 (Bankhead Highway). The schools that serve the neighborhood are Stanton Elementary, Carter G. Woodson Elementary School, Ron Clark Academy, Herndon Elementary and Washington High School, and the Atlanta Job Corps. City of Refuge, a community-based 501(c)(3) non-profit, was established on the 1300 block of Joseph E. Boone Blvd. in 2003 and helps to bring transformation to individuals and families through services including housing, health and wellness, vocational training, and youth development. History During the 1940s and 1950s Hunter Hills came to life as one of the few planned black communities of its time. Hunter Hills was partially responsible for the economic rise in Atlanta after World War II. Its history is shared with other neighboring communities such as Mozley Park, Washington Park, and Dixie Hills, which all were part of the Battle of Ezra Church. Several black contractors such as Herman Glass, developed and purchased land in what is now known as Hunter Hills. Most of the lots were 50 x 150 ft (15 x 46 m2) and they could obtain a loan from First Atlanta National, Citizens or Southern Banks. If a person was able to afford $5 down and $5 per month he was making Hunter Hills' history and could become a part of a new black community in Atlanta. Hunter Hills is bounded south to MLK and the Seaboard Coast rail- line, east to the Beltline (former Louiseviile and Nashville RR. and Mayson Turner Rd., Joseph Boone St. North and west to Holly Road. Its West Side Siege Line is located on the corner of Joseph Boone (Simpson Road) and Chappell Road.http://www.streetadvisor.com/hunter-hills-atlanta-fulton-county-georgia Hunter Hills is part of two Neighborhood Planning Units (NPU's), J and K, which are separated by Holly Rd. Even house number belong to NPU J and odd house numbers belong to K. Hunter Hills is adjacent to the esteemed Atlanta University Center Consortium (commonly referred to as the AUC Consortium). The consortium includes: Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, Spelman College, and Morehouse School of Medicine. Proposed development Hunter Hills falls on the western edge of the proposed Beltline and is minutes from the City of Atlanta's planned Westside Park. Hunter Hills is also served by local transit MARTA. It shares the West Lake Marta Station with West Lake and Dixie Hills communities, and MARTA bus line 51 runs north to south from Joseph Boone to Martin Luther King streets. Hunter Hills is north of the proposed Martin Luther King Corridor Redevelopment, which will dramatically increase home ownership and bring in local businesses. Hunter Hills is also one of many westside neighborhoods affected by the nation's foreclosure crisis. However, real estate investors expect the proposed development plans to spur the neighborhood's revitalization.

(2006). \\"Toward a Framework for Modeling Space Systems Architectures.\\" NASA, JPL. Military theorist Carl von Clausewitz stressed the significance of grasping the fundamentals of any situation in the \\"blink of an eye\\" (coup d'≈ìil). In a military context, the astute tactician can immediately grasp a range of implications and can begin to anticipate plausible and appropriate courses of action.Calusewitz, Carl. (1982). On War, p. 141; \\"Defining 'Taxonomy',\\" Straights Knowledge website. Clauzewitz' conceptual \\"blink\\" represents a tentative ontology which organizes a set of concepts within a domain. A conventional military taxonomy might be an hierarchical set of classifications for a given set of objects; and the progress of reasoning is developed from the general to the more specific. In such taxonomic schema, a conflative term is always a polyseme.Malone, Joseph L. (1988). The Science of Linguistics in the Art of Translation: Some Tools from Linguistics for the Analysis and Practice of Translation, p. 112. In contrast, a less conventional approach might employ an open-ended contextual military taxonomy‚Äîa taxonomy holding only with respect to a specific context; and the progress of reasoning is developed form the specific to the more general.Grossi, Davide, Frank Dignum and John-Jules Charles Meyer. (2005). \\"Contextual Taxonomies\\" in Computational Logic in Multi-Agent Systems, pp. 33-51. Descriptive paradigm A taxonomy of terms to describe various types of military operations is fundamentally affected by the way all elements are defined and addressed‚Äînot unlike framing. In terms of a specific military operation, a taxonomic approach based on differentiation and categorization of the entities participating would produce results which were quite different from an approach based on functional objective of an operation (such as peacekeeping, disaster relief, or counter- terrorism). An incidental advantage which flows from give-and-take in refining taxonomic terms more accurately and efficiently becomes more than a worthwhile objective in terms of anticipated outcomes or results. In today's nontraditional operations, the discussion about fundamentals also generates greater precision in how the defense and security community understands and discusses integrated operations.Downie, Richard D. \\"Defining integrated operations,\\" Joint Force Quarterly (Washington, D.C.). July, 2005. =Hy≈´ga class helicopter destroyer= Military taxonomy in Japan is circumscribed by Japan's pacifist post-war constitution. For example, this affects classification of the Hy≈´ga class helicopter carriers, which are ships of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). This type of helicopter carrier was formally identified as a helicopter destroyer (DDH) to comply with explicit constitutional limitations written in Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution.[ \\"Japan's Largest 'Helicopter Carrier' Commissioned Amid Concerns,\\" Kyodo News International. March 18, 2009. The two ships of this class, the JS Hy≈´ga and the JS Ise resemble a light aircraft carrier or amphibious assault ship such as the Italian Navy's 13,850-ton Giuseppe Garibaldi, the Spanish Navy's 17,000-ton Principe de Asturias or the Royal Navy's 21,000-ton Invincible- class carriers.

A taxonomic label of \\"aircraft carrier\\" is legally proscribed. \\"Japan Commissioned Its Biggest Helicopter Carrier,\\" AvionNews (World Aeronautical Press Agency). March 18, 2009. Each ship in this class has attracted media and Diet attention because of its resemblance to an aircraft carrier. Until the 1970s, US Navy taxonomy categorized large-scale flattops as \\"attack aircraft carriers\\" and small flattops as \\"antisubmarine aircraft carriers.\\" In Japan, the constitutional prohibition against having \\"attack\\" aircraft carries has been construed to encompass small aircraft carriers but not helicopter carriers. A uniquely Japanese taxonomic template is applied to these ships and to their missions, which are limited to \\"military operations other than war\\" (MOOTW). Strategic paradigm A number of military strategies can be parsed using a taxonomy model. The comparative theoretical framework might posit a range of criteria, e.g., the character of envisaged political goals, the type of military strategy preferred, and the scope of forces engaged; and this template suggests discrete modes of force. The taxonomy-model analysis suggests a useful depiction of the spectrum of the use of military force in a political context.Cohen, Stuart A. and Efraim Inbar. \\"A taxonomy of Israel's use of military force,\\" Journal Comparative Strategy, Vol. 10, No. 2 (April 1991), pp. 121 - 138. =Parsing terrorism= In the 21st century, the ambit of a subset taxonomy of terrorism would include terms related to terrorists, terrorist groups, terrorist attacks, weapons, venues, and characteristics of terrorists and terrorist groups. Limitations Taxonomies offer useful, but incomplete means of structuring information.Electronic Mapping Systems: taxonomy Taxonomies are a necessary but not sufficient condition for adequate evaluation of a given data set. While the taxonomic categorizations and sub-categorizations do enhance understanding, it may be significant that the lack of detail in describing objects or elements creates room for ambiguity.

He is known for his ski accomplishments and teaching.  Early beginnings  Junior Bounous was born on August 24, 1925 in Provo, Utah. He was the sixth child of Italian fruit farmers, and grew up learning how to ride horses, ice skate, and take care of the farm. Since farm life was busy, his parents never thought of a name for him at the time of his birth, so until well into his mid-20s his birth certificate read \\"Boy Bounous\\".Bounous, Junior. Telephone. 21 May 2008. Being the youngest of a large family, his unofficial name became \\"Junior\\" immediately, and since then no one has ever thought about changing it. Growing up in Provo Canyon, he was introduced to multiple winter sports at a young age. One in particular that he immediately became attracted to was skiing. At the age of 8, he made his own pair of skis out of barrel staves that his dad had cut out for him. He taught himself how to move on skis near home, where he would hike up a small hill in his backyard and then push himself down. Since it was not very big, he usually only got one turn from it, and it typically was a left turn as to avoid a pile of manure at the bottom of the hill. To this day, Junior claims that his left turn is better than his right because of this.Bounous, Junior. Telephone. 21 May 2008. When he was 11 years old, his mother bought him his first pair of real skis. When he was still in his teens, Junior became friends with Ray Stewart. Also a skier, Stewart's wealthy family had bought a large plot of land in Provo Canyon, and Stewart wanted help setting up a rope tow. At the age of 18, Junior helped him set one up, and played a role in scouting for a place to put it and finding an adequate run that skiers of all abilities would be use.Utah Storybook \\"Before Sundance  Ski career  In 1943 Bounous joined the Civilian Defense Corps, created at Timp Haven as a group of individuals who were essentially the first ski patrol in the area. They did search and rescue efforts in Provo Canyon in both the summer and the winter during the war period. Junior's ski talents were to be used for something else however, as a new prominent figure entered Junior's life. In 1939, the second chairlift in the nation and the first in Utah opened in Alta Ski Resort. Junior moved down from Sun Valley to work with Alf Engen and his brother Sverre to get the ski resort going. Junior at the time was mainly interested in competing in cross-country skiing, and because Alf Engen was the best cross-country skier in the nation at the time, Junior went to him for lessons around 1945.Bounousabuse:80 Junior Years. Dir. Larsen Jay. Perf. Junior Bounous. DVD. Doublejay Creative Production, 2006. The reasons for the lessons changed quickly as Junior realized that was more interested in the techniques of teaching people to ski instead of competing. Alf Engen taught him his philosophy on ski instructing, one that highlighted the enjoyment of skiing in contrast to the strict ways of the Austrians that had been used before. In 1948 Alf Engen encouraged Junior to apply for certification of ski instructing. Bounous passed, and at the young age of 23 got his Forest Service Certification, being one of the first to achieve it. Alf Engen hired him as a full time instructor at Alta, and from 1948 to 1958 worked as Engen's professional assistant.Bounousabuse:80 Junior Years. Dir. Larsen Jay. Perf. Junior Bounous. DVD. Doublejay Creative Production, 2006. In 1958 Junior was offered a job at California's Sugar Bowl Ski Resort as their Ski School Director. He accepted, becoming one of the first American born Ski School Directors ever. While under him, the ski school staff grew from 5 to 15 in seven years. He created Sugar Bowl's first children's program before moving back to Utah in the 1960s to go back to the now popular Timp Haven Ski Resort, where he became a part time owner until Robert Redford bought the resort in 1969. Though the name was changed to Sundance, Redford kept Junior there as Ski School Director for a few more years, during which Bounous helped expand the resort.Utah Storybook \\"Before Sundance In 1970 a new opportunity arrived. Ted Johnson and Dick Bass came to Junior, asking him to help them map out the area for a new ski resort that they wanted to open up next to Alta Ski Resort in Little Cottonwood Canyon, Utah. Bounous was hired to do the entire layout of ski runs for the resort and directed the cutting crews and bulldozer work. Once the new Snowbird ski resort opened up in 1971, Junior Bounous became the first Ski School Director. Under him, Snowbird's ski school became ranked as one of the top in the nation, a position it still holds to this today. As Ski School Director, Junior created a children's program as well as a program for the disabled. In 1991, Bounous accepted the position of Director of Skiing, and created his most famous program, one meant for senior citizens called \\"Silver Wings\\".Bounous, Junior. Telephone. 21 May 2008. Over his life he was also filmed in well over 10 Warren Miller films. \\"I went out of my way to put him in the films for a long time because he was so much better than anyone else,\\" Warren Miller said in an interview for the Documentary film \\"Bounousabuse: 80 Junior Years.\\" In one Warren Miller film, Junior puts his skis on backwards and skis down the hill with his back facing down, becoming one of the first to do so.The Color of Skiing.

(2003) Diffusion of Innovations, 5th ed., p. 109. The term originated during World War II when the P-80 Shooting Star was designed by Lockheed‚Äôs Advanced Development Projects Division in Burbank, California, under similar circumstances. A closely guarded incubator was set up in a circus tent next to a plastics factory in Burbank. The strong smells that wafted into the tent made the Lockheed R&D; workers think of the foul-smelling ‚ÄúSkonk Works‚Äù factory in Al Capp‚Äôs Li'l Abner comic strip. Since its origination with Skunk Works, the term was generalized to apply to similar high-priority R&D; projects at other large organizations which feature a small elite team removed from the normal working environment and given freedom from management constraints. The term typically refers to technology projects developed in semi-secrecy, such as Google X Lab. Other famous skunkworks were Microsoft Research, special teams at Boeing, and the lab of about 50 people established by Steve Jobs to develop the Macintosh computer, located behind the Good Earth Restaurant in Cupertino. Evolution of the idea The Economist notes that the expectations for the products developed by skunkworks have changed in the 21st century from \\"something that makes their competitors say 'Wow'\\" to \\"something that makes their competitors' customers say 'Wow'\\".

About the project The Paper Project is a multidimensional art and science project exploring the microscopic structure of paper using a scanning-laser confocal microscope. Created by artist and scientist Charles Kazilek and printer and paper maker Gene Valentine in 1999 the project has been exhibiting works in various formats including 2D and virtual 3D images. The 3D anaglyphic images make use of inexpensive red-blue 3D glasses first introduced to movie goers in the 1950s. When wearing 3D glasses, it is as if the viewer has been reduced to the size of a period at the end of a sentence and is able to explore the invisible structure and beauty of paper. In 2002, the project expanded to dance, collaborating with costume designers Jacqueline Benard and Galina Mihaleva and dance choreographer Jennifer Tsukayama. The result of the collaboration was Paper Interiors: a dance exploration of real and virtual dimensions that debuted at the American College Dance Festival. In 2004, Jennifer Tsukayama became a member of the Paper Project and the group created a traveling 3D immersive room based on the earlier dance performance. The first installation of the room was at the Arizona Museum for Youth. Since its creation, images from the Paper Project have been viewed around the world in museums, science centers, and on the Web. In addition to exhibits the Paper Project has developed educational content that can be used to engage students in art, history, biology, chemistry, and physics. =Exhibits= *A New Light on Paper. 27th Conference of the Southern Graphics Council.

The victims were Jim Barclay, the manager of Wonnangatta Station,The word \\"station\\" in Australia means ranch or pastoral holding of some size and John Bamford, a cook and general hand. Barclay was a well-respected and much-liked bushman, while Bamford was regarded with suspicion, and was known to be easily roused into violent tempers. The case has never been solved. Barclay and Bamford James (\\"Jim\\") Barclay was employed as the Wonnangatta Station manager in about 1916. He usually lived alone at the station. Aged in his late 40s, he had previously lost his wife to tuberculosis and left his newborn child James (also \\"Jim\\") to be cared for by relatives. Stephenson describes him as a \\"hardy and competent bushman ... a contented man of simple tastes.\\"Stephenson, Harry (1980) p.70 His nearest neighbour was Harry Smith, stepson of the original owner, with whom he had a good relationship. In December 1917 Barclay decided to employ a cook and station hand. English-born John Bamford had lived at Black Snake Creek, from Talbotville, for twenty years. By 1917 he was aged in his late 50s and was variously described as \\"surly\\" having a \\"wicked temper\\"Clark, Mary Ryllis (1986) p.2 and being suspected of \\"having strangled his wife\\".Mortimer, Wallace (1980) p. 80 However, Keith Leydon and Michael Ray suggest there is no evidence of this.Keith Leydon & Michael Ray (2000)The Wonnangatta Mystery:an inquiry into the unsolved murders. Warrior Press, Mansfield. What Barclay thought of him is not known, but Talbotville storekeeper Albert Stout is known to have warned Barclay not to be \\"drawn into arguments with Bamford\\". With the First World War raging and few men available for labour in the bush, it's likely Barclay had few choices regarding employees. Alan King, a stockman, stayed at Wonnangatta in late December 1917 and recalled that Bamford seemed to be on good terms with Barclay. Barclay and Bamford were last seen alive in late December 1917. They had been to Talbotville to cast their votes in the so-called Reinforcement Referendum, the second of the two plebiscites held in Australia during the First World War to decide whether to introduce military conscription. It is not known how they voted, only that they agreed on the vote. They stayed the night with Albert Stout in Talbotville, before leaving for Wonnangatta at about 10 o'clock on the morning of 21 December.  The discovery of the murder of Barclay  On 22 January 1918,Stephenson gives the date 22 December 1917. Note; It is hard to believe Smith made a journey to deliver mail only a day after Barclay and Bamford had been in Talbotville Harry Smith arrived at the station to deliver mail.He was not a local mailman as some accounts suggest. His Eaglevale property was close to 1,000 acres according to Mortimer He found Barclay and Bamford absent, although the words ‚ÄòHome tonight‚Äô were chalked across the kitchen door. Smith stayed two nights, but no one came home, so he returned to Eaglevale on 24 January 1918.Stephenson gives the date 24 December 1917 Harry Smith returned to the Wonnangatta homestead late in the afternoon on 14 February 1918. The homestead was still deserted and the mail still sitting where he had previously left it on the kitchen table. Smith was shocked to find Barclay's favourite dog \\"Baron,\\" starving and neglected. He briefly searched the area again, stayed the night at the homestead and left for Dargo the next day to raise the alarm. There he telegraphed the owners, Arthur Phillips and Geoffrey Ritchie of Mansfield. On 23 February 1918,Stephenson gives the date 25 January Arthur Phillips and stockman Jack Jebb arrived at Eaglevale from Mansfield. With Harry Smith they returned to Wonnangatta. After a prolonged search they discovered a badly decomposed body near the Conglomerate Creek, about \\"420 paces\\"Mortimer, Wallace (1980) p.87 south east of the homestead.This map shows a reconstruction of the homestead and the position of Barclay's body when found. Reproduced from The Wonnangatta Murders by Keith Leydon and Michael Ray From the remaining pieces of clothing, a belt and a tobacco pouch, Smith identified it as Barclay. The body had been buried in a shallow grave, but dingos and foxes had apparently uncovered it. Newspaper reports that the skull was detached from the body at the time were incorrect, The skull was attached but protruding from the sand. The body was reburied. Phillips returned to Mansfield and contacted police. Shortly after, Detective Alex McKerral was dispatched from Melbourne, together with Constable Ryan, a native of the Mansfield district. Several days later, the police party set out from Mansfield on the ride across the Great Dividing Range to Wonnangatta, to collect Barclay's remains and return them for a post-mortem at Mansfield hospital. Wallace Mortimer recounts the famous tale of the Police party finding strychnine in the pepper container when they prepared a meal in the homestead on the night of their arrival. Police found a shotgun in Barclay's room that had recently been discharged although there were no bloodstains in the room. His bed was in \\"a state of disorder.\\"Stephenson, Harry (1980) p.73 Bamford's room was also in some disorder, and his horse, saddle and some belongings were missing. On the return journey, on the Howitt high plains, the police party came across the horse that John Bamford had ridden to Talbotville for the vote, running wild without a saddle or bridle. The post-mortem The post-mortem found that Barclay had been murdered by a shotgun blast in the back, and had been dead for several weeks by the time of discovery. At the inquest that followed, McKerral said; \\"I am of the opinion that Barclay and Bamford had an argument over working matters and that Bamford loaded the gun and shot Barclay. He removed his working clothes, and dressed himself in Barclay‚Äôs suit, which is missing, saddled his horse and after dragging the deceased to the creek, rode the horse away.\\"McKerral cited in Stephenson, Harry (1980) p.73 The verdict of the inquest was murder by person or persons unknown, probably sometime between 21 December 1917 and 4 January 1918. Jim Barclay's body was handed to his extended family who lived on the Mornington Peninsula, and he was buried at Tyabb Cemetery. The discovery of Bamford‚Äôs body Bamford was now the prime suspect, and a statewide search was begun. A reward of ¬£200 was offered by the government for information regarding Barclay's murder. See Page 6 of the Victorian Government Gazette, 5 June 1918 A man claiming to be Bamford, and claiming to have killed Barclay, was arrested near Yarram and charged. However, it was realised that this person was suffering from delusions. He was later identified as a vagrant known as James Baker. In early November 1918, Mounted Constable Hayes, together with local bushmen Harry Smith, William Hearne and Jim Fry, were searching the Mount Howitt area when Hearne noticed a boot protruding from a pile of logs, near the Howitt Plains Hut. Under the pile they found Bamford's body. As the route to Mansfield was still under snow, the body was taken to Dargo. The post-mortem found a bullet lodged in the skull, and again at the inquest, a verdict of murder by person or persons unknown was made. Bamford's body was buried at Dargo cemetery. Theories Up to this point it had been taken for granted that Barclay had been killed by Bamford. Speculation now followed the line \\"that Bamford shot Barclay and afterwards Bamford was shot by some friend of the manager, in revenge, in the good old wild west manner.\\"McKerral cited in Stephenson, Harry (1980) p.75 Police suspicion naturally fell on Harry Smith, but there was no direct evidence. In addition, he would have had to carry out a complex deception about the discovery of Barclay's body, and he was present at the discovery of Bamford's. It is also unlikely he would have knowingly allowed the body of his friend Jim Barclay to lie where the murderer left it and be disturbed by animals for three weeks. He was not charged. Writing in 1980, Harry Stephenson seems to favour the theory that Smith \\"might have had an answer to the mystery\\" and noted that older cattlemen were still reluctant to discuss the case.Stephenson, Harry (1980) p.75 A second theory was that the two men had been victims of stock thieves. Wallace Mortimer suggests Barclay and later Bamford were perhaps killed by horse thieves, and cites \\"old timers [who] are adamant in their belief such was the reason.\\"Mortimer, Wallace (1980) p.106 The Police report refutes this, pointing out that the only stock missing from Wonnangatta was Bamford's horse that had been recovered on Mount Howitt. Wallace Mortimer dismissed any significance of the right shoe and a hat found placed near the crotch of Barclay's body. According to Mortimer, the idea that this implied a motive for the killing (Barclay, a ladies man, killed by a jealous husband) came from a novelist, \\"who had obviously done little or no research into the matter.\\"Mortimer, Wallace (1980) p.121 Aftermath After he finished his schooling, Jim Barclay's son Jim (junior) went to work for Harry Smith, for many years, at Eaglevale. Harry Smith died aged about 86 in 1945.The Wonnangatta Mystery: An inquiry into the unsolved murders by Keith Leydon and Michael Ray (2000). Page 127, Warrior Press, Mansfield, Victoria. Sometime in the late 1970s Mortimer interviewed Jim Barclay Junior for his history of Wonnangatta Station. Barclay's enigmatic comment on the murders was; \\" It was all a long time ago and both the murderers are long since dead. I can't see that anything can be gained now, it's all best forgotten.\\"Mortimer, Wallace (1980) p.120 See also *List of solved missing persons cases *List of unsolved murders References External links *Photos of Harry Smith's hut at Eaglevale. *Alpine Park Page, with link to Friends of Wonnangatta Group * Australian Alps National Park government website 1910s missing person cases 1910s murders in Australia 1917 crimes in Australia 1917 murders in Oceania 1918 crimes in Australia 1918 murders in Oceania Alpine National Park Formerly missing people found dead Missing person cases in Australia Murder in Victoria (Australia) Unsolved murders in Australia ","title":"Wonnangatta murders"},{"id":"21172466","text":"Frederick William Shaw Mayer MBE (26 September 1899 - 1 September 1989), also well known as \\"Masta Pisin\\" or the \\"Bird Man\\" in New Guinea, was an Australian ornithologist, aviculturist and zoological collector. He is notable for his work in New Guinea, especially with birds-of-paradise. Early years Mayer was educated in Sydney at Homebush Primary School, Petersham High School and Sydney Grammar School. After leaving school Mayer had abortive career starts as a surveyor and in the building industry. Then he decided to follow his childhood interest in wildlife and became a zoological collector for museums and zoos.Peckover, W.S.; & George, G.G. (1992). Obituary: ‚ÄòMasta Pisin‚Äô - The Bird Man of New Guinea, Fred Shaw Mayer M.B.E. 1899-1989. Emu 92: 250-254. The wildlife collector Mayer became very skilled at caring for live mammals and birds as well as preparing their skins. His abilities as a collector and preparator were recognised early in his life. After an initial self-funded collecting expedition to South-East Asia, Mayer collected extensively through the 1920s in South-East Asia and New Guinea, concentrating on New Guinea almost exclusively from the 1930s onward. A principal client of his was Walter Rothschild, for whom he supplied specimens for the Rothschild Zoological Museum at Tring in Hertfordshire, England. Other clients included John Spedan Lewis and Jean Delacour. The \\"Bird Man\\" In 1953 Mayer became manager of Sir Edward Hallstrom‚Äôs aviaries at Nondugl in the Wahgi Valley of the Western Highlands of Papua New Guinea. This largely avicultural facility, which later became known as the Nondugl Bird of Paradise Sanctuary, acted mainly as a staging post for Taronga Zoo in Sydney, either to provide birds directly for Taronga, or for exchanges with other zoos. As well as managing the establishment, Mayer used it as a base for further collecting expeditions. He also became an expert on hand-rearing young birds-of-paradise. Mayer was also involved in the establishment of the Baiyer River Sanctuary, set up after Hallstrom donated part of his collection of birds-of-paradise to the then Australian-administered government of Papua New Guinea. Despite health problems Mayer established the aviaries at the sanctuary in 1967 and acted as manager until it was opened in 1968, following which he stepped down. His final collecting trip in New Guinea took place early in 1970, from Lae to the Cromwell Mountains of the Huon Peninsula. Recognition Mayer was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1971 New Year Honours, \\"for services to aviculture\\", for his work in establishing the Nondugl and Baiyer River sanctuaries, as well as for the breeding of birds-of-paradise. He was also made the first honorary life member of the Papua New Guinea Bird Society. He retired to Australia, living for many more years in Nambour, Queensland, where he died 25 days before his 90th birthday. He is commemorated in the names of several New Guinea animals, including the: * Ribbon-tailed astrapia (Astrapia mayeri) * Pygmy ringtail possum (Pseudochirulus mayeri) * Shaw Mayer's brush mouse (Pogonomelomys mayeri) * Shaw Mayer's water rat (Hydromys shawmayeri) References 1899 births 1989 deaths Australian ornithologists Members of the Order of the British Empire 20th-century zoologists ","title":"Fred Shaw Mayer"},{"id":"21172487","text":"Henry L√≥pez B√°ez (born 3 July 1967, in Montevideo) is a former Uruguayan footballer.

It was found at the entrance of Suksusa Temple, in Sunheung-myeon, Yeongju City, Gyeongsangbuk-do South Korea. Sosu Seowon was founded by Ju Sebung (Ï£ºÏÑ∏Î∂ï/ 1495‚Äì1554), who was serving as magistrate of Pungseong county. Sosu Seowon was one of 47 seowons that survived from the Seowon Abolishment by Heungseon Daewongun Regent in 1871. It has been well preserved retaining most of its old structures and is designated as National Treasure of South Korea No.55 History In 1542, during the 37th year of King Jungjong's reign (1506‚Äì44) of the Joseon Dynasty, the magistrate of Punggi County and Confucian scholar, Ju Se-bung, built Baekundong Seowon, renamed to Sosu Seowon in 1550, to honor the peaceful times of Goryeo. Also in 1550, during the reign of King Myeongjong of the Joseon Dynasty, Toegye Yi Hwang established Sosu Seowon as the first legislated private institute of Korea. Many criticized Ju Se-bung's actions of founding Baekundong (Sosu) Seowon during a time of famine. But be defended himself by quoting Zhu Xi (1130‚Äì1200), the scholar who systematized Neo-Confucianism in Song dynasty. Like Zhu Xi, Ju Se-bung believed that education was the cardinal virtue of man, and ought to be promoted above all else. Ju Se-bung was a man ahead of his time. Private academies blossomed across Korea in short order, but because Sosu Seowon was the first, it became one of the richest. After Ju Se-bung departed as magistrate, local scholars continued fund raising campaigns, receiving vast donations of grain, land, and slaves to support the academy. Sosu Seowon grew in prestige because it enshrined An Hyang (1243 -1306), a local a Confucian scholar who lived during the end of the Goryeo Dynasty who had brought Neo-Confucianism to Korea from China in the 13th century. The academy gained even more prestige when Toegye (Yi Hwang) (1501‚Äì70), the preeminent Neo-Confucian philosopher of Korea, became magistrate of the county. He asked King Myeongjong to grant the academy a royal charter. The king responded favorably, sending a plaque with the name \\"Sosu Seowon\\" in the king's own handwriting, along with a generous supply of books. The annals of the king give interesting clues to the relation of the academy to the state. It specifies that the local magistrate cannot interfere in the affairs of the academy, nor disturb the Confucian scholars. The academy was to be promoted as a place where scholars could gather without interference from the monarchy. About 4,000 scholars, including the pupils of Confucian scholar Toegye Yi Hwang, studied at the institute. During the Joseon era (1392‚Äì1910), Korean Buddhism suffered heavy persecution. Many temples were closed and renovated for other uses. Because Sosu Seowon originally had been a Buddhist temple and then became a private academy, Sosu Seowon has an unconventional architectural layout compared with later Confucian academies. Today Sosu Seowon also has Munseonggong Shrine, which was built to enshrine An Hyang, An Bo, An Chuk and Ju Se-bung, where a memorial service takes place on the first day of the third and ninth months of the lunar calendar every year. The basic principle of Chinese architectural locates the study facilities at the front of the structure and the shrine to the rear, as seen in most Korean Confucian academies. But Sosu Seowon is based on the arrangement of having the study facilities placed in the east and the shrine placed in the west, positioning the greater emphasis on the east. On the right of the Sosu Seowon entrance is the Okgyesu, a stream of the Nakdong River coming from Mt. Sobaek. Inside Sosu Seowon's auditorium is a 'Sosu Seowon' sign engraved by King Myeongjong. Behind the auditorium there are Jikbangjae, Ilshinjae, Hakgujae and Jirakjae. On the east side are the Seogo, the portrait of Anhyang (National Treasure No.111) painted at the end of Goryeo Dynasty, and the Munseong Tomb where the Daesungjisung King Munseon‚Äôs Jeonjwado (National Treasure No.485) is enshrined. Today, an average of 800,000 tourists visit Sosu Seowon every year. Inside the institute is the Sosu Museum which exhibits a wide range of traditional Confucian cultural assets.

The Supreme Court cast the case as \\"a heated dispute between individual citizens and certain policemen ... [that] has evolved into an attempt by the federal judiciary to resolve a 'controversy' between the entire citizenry of Philadelphia and the petitioning elected and appointed officials over what steps might, in the Court of Appeals' words, '[appear] to have the potential for prevention of future police misconduct.'\\"423 U.S. at 371. The court - \\"express[ing] grave doubts about the justiciability\\" of the case - held that \\"the individual respondents' claim to 'real and immediate' injury rests not upon what the named petitioners might do to them in the future  such as set a bond on the basis of race  but upon what one of a small, unnamed minority of policemen might do to them in the future because of that unknown policeman's perception of departmental disciplinary procedures. This hypothesis is even more attenuated than those allegations of future injury found insufficient in O'Shea to warrant invocation of federal jurisdiction. Thus, insofar as the individual respondents were concerned, we think they lacked [standing].\\"423 U.S. at 372. Moreover, \\"appropriate consideration must be given to principles of federalism in determining the availability and scope of equitable relief,\\" the court said; \\"[w]here, as here, the exercise of authority by state officials is attacked, federal courts must be constantly mindful of the \\"special delicacy of the adjustment to be preserved between federal equitable power and State administration of its own law.\\"423 U.S. at 378-9. In such a setting, \\"principles of equity ... militate heavily against the grant of an injunction except in the most extraordinary circumstances.\\"423 U.S. at 379. Aftermath In 1978, the High Court declared in Monell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New York that Rizzo \\"decided that the mere right to control, without any control or direction having been exercised and without any failure to supervise, is not enough to support ¬ß 1983 liability.\\", at fn. 58 When read together, the two cases support the proposition that ¬ß1983 supervisory liability cannot be based on respondeat superior. Rizzo was cited in the later Supreme Court ruling in Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, a significant case in United States constitutional law which held that state officials enjoy immunity from suit on the basis of state law claims in federal court. Rizzo's use of the doctrine of equitable restraint, as used in Pennhurst, has been questioned as to whether it can be justified.

It was a common view among Anglicans in the 16th and 17th centuries, and prominent theologians who subscribed to this doctrine were Thomas Cranmer and Richard Hooker. Anglicanism Anglican theologian Claude B. Moss defines receptionism as \\"the theory that we receive the Body and Blood of Christ when we receive the bread and wine, but they are not identified with the bread and wine which are not changed\\".Claude B. Moss, The Christian Faith: An Introduction to Dogmatic Theology (London: SPCK 1943), p. 366, cited in Brian Douglas, A Companion to Anglican Eucharistic Theology (BRILL 2012), vol. 2, p. 181 It teaches that \\"the sacramental gift is received by faith\\", but it has often been misunderstood or misrepresented as teaching that \\"faith creates the sacrament\\". The term itself seems not to have appeared before 1867, but the teaching has roots going back to the English Reformation, particularly to the theology of Thomas Cranmer. Although older authors such as Dix and Gibson describe Cranmer's Eucharistic theology as \\"Zwinglian\\", more recent scholars such as MacCulloch, Bates and Beckwith & Tiller class it as \\"receptionism\\". In describing Cranmer's changes to the communion service in the 1552 Book of Common Prayer, Colin Buchanan writes, \\"the only 'moment' is reception‚Äîand the only point where the bread and wine signify the body and blood is at reception\\", when the communicants remembered Christ's offering of himself on the cross. It was also held in some form by Richard Hooker. According to him, the bread is unchanged at the blessing of the priest, but becomes an effectual spiritual sign when received by someone in faith. V.lxvii.5-7 This Eucharistic teaching was commonly held by 16th and 17th-century Anglican theologians. It was characteristic of 17th century thought to \\"insist on the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, but to profess agnosticism concerning the manner of the presence ...\\" It remained \\"the dominant theological position in the Church of England until the Oxford Movement in the early nineteenth century, with varying degrees of emphasis\\". It is important to remember that it is \\"a doctrine of the real presence\\" but one which \\"relates the presence primarily to the worthy receiver rather than to the elements of bread and wine\\". Receptionism rules out the practice of Eucharistic adoration, a practice that in any case most Protestants reject as unscriptural. Roman Catholic rejection The 16th-century Council of Trent condemned this teaching, declaring that \\"if any one saith, that, after the consecration is completed, the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ are not in the admirable sacrament of the Eucharist, but (are there) only during the use, whilst it is being taken, and not either before or after; and that, in the hosts, or consecrated particles, which are reserved or which remain after communion, the true Body of the Lord remaineth not; let him be anathema\\". The Catholic Church's rejection of receptionism was reaffirmed by Pope Paul VI in his papal encyclical Mysterium fidei of 3 September 1965. Citing Origen, Hippolytus of Rome, Novatian and Cyril of Alexandria, he stated: \\"The Catholic Church has always displayed and still displays this latria that ought to be paid to the Sacrament of the Eucharist, both during Mass and outside of it, by taking the greatest possible care of consecrated Hosts, by exposing them to the solemn veneration of the faithful, and by carrying them about in processions to the joy of great numbers of the people.\\" paragraphs 56-61 See also *Lord's Supper in Reformed theology References Anglican Eucharistic theology Eucharist ","title":"Receptionism"},{"id":"21172727","text":"Bruckmann, Rosser, Sherrill & Co. is an American private equity firm focused on growth capital investments in middle-market companies in the consumer products, specialty retail and restaurant sectors.

It was originally derived from the corn tortilla, a flatbread of maize which predates the arrival of Europeans to the Americas. Made with a flour and water based dough, it is pressed and cooked similar to corn tortillas.Dishes from the Wild Horse Desert: Norteo Cooking of South Texas, by Melissa Guerra,1 edition 2006, Wiley; The simplest recipes use only flour, water, fat, and salt, but commercially-made flour tortillas generally contain chemical leavening agents such as baking powder, and other ingredients.  History  The flour tortilla is a variant of corn tortilla and its name comes from Spanish and means \\"small cake\\". Oldest found tortillas date back as far as 10,000 years BCE and were made of native maize with dried kernel. It was the principal food of the Aztecs and other mesoamerican civilizations. Flour tortillas originated in the northern mexican states of Chihuahua, Durango, Sonora and Sinaloa, where the territory is more suited to growing wheat than corn. But in recent times they have become both integral to Mexican‚Äîand Tex-Mex‚Äîcuisine.  Etymology  Tortilla, from Spanish torta, cake, plus the diminutive -illa, literally means \\"little cake\\". Tortilla in Iberian Spanish also means omelette. As such, this wheat flour flatbread tortilla is not to be confused with the Spanish omelette or any other egg based one.  Production  Tortillas being made in Old Town San Diego A thick, American-style pea soup garnished with a tortilla sliver Wheat tortillas are a staple of the northern Mexican stateshttp://www.explorandomexico.com/about-mexico/5/215/ (such as Sonora, Sinaloa and Chihuahua) and throughout the Southwestern United States. Tortillas vary in size from about 6 to over 30 cm (2.4 to over 12 in), depending on the region of the country and the dish for which it is intended. Industrially-produced tortillas typically contain numerous chemicals in order to ease the production process, control texture and flavor, and to extend shelf life. Work has been done at Washington State University to develop methods for producing tortillas on a mass scale while still using only whole- wheat flour, water, oil, and salt, with a fermented flour-and-water sourdough starter replacing chemical leaveners.  Tortillas today  Tortilla machine (Xochimilco market) Today, personal and industrial (Mexican-style) tortilla- making equipment has facilitated and expedited tortilla making. Manually operated wooden tortilla presses of the past led to today's industrial tortilla machinery, which can produce up to 60,000 tortillas per hour. Tortillas are now not only made from maize meal, but also from wheat flour; home-made and store-bought tortillas are made in many flavors and varieties. Tortillas remain a staple food in Mexico and Central America, and have gained popularity and market share elsewhere. In the U.S., tortillas have grown from an \\"ethnic\\" to a mainstream food. They have surpassed bagels and muffins, and have now become the number two packaged bread product sold in the U.S (behind sliced bread). The Tortilla Industry Association (TIA) estimates, in the U.S. alone, the tortilla industry (tortillas and their products ‚Äì tortilla chips, tostada shells and taco shells) has become a US$6 billion a year industry.  Nutritional information  Soft wheat tortillas use wheat instead of masa as the primary ingredient. The Mission Foods brand lists the following ingredients: Enriched Bleached Wheat Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamine Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid), Water, Vegetable Shortening (Interesterified Soybean oil, Hydrogenated Soybean Oil and/or Palm Oil), contains 2% or less of: Salt, Sugar, Leavening (Sodium Bicarbonate, Sodium aluminum sulfate, Corn starch, Monocalcium phosphate and/or Sodium acid pyrophosphate, Calcium Sulfate), Distilled Monoglycerides, Enzymes, Wheat Starch, Calcium Carbonate, Antioxidants (Tocopherols, Ascorbic acid, Citric acid), Cellulose gum, Guar gum, Dough conditioner (Fumaric acid, Sodium Metabisulfite and/or Mono- and Diglycerides), Calcium propionate and Sorbic acid (to preserve freshness).

Retrieved: 2012-09-08. = Mexico = The word \\"tortilla\\" in these countries is used to refer to the ubiquitous corn tortilla, made of maize. In Mexico burritos are made with wheat tortillas. Flour tortillas were also very popular in Tex-Mex food and plates like fajitas. Flour tortilla with beans and eggs was very popular in northern Mexico and in the Southwest. The origin of the flour tortilla was northern Mexico and this is why so many plates are made with it like quesadillas as well as burritos, chimichangas and fajitas served with flour tortilla and bean taco or chorizo taco. The flour tortilla is the sister to the corn tortilla which was created first. From Mexico City southward the corn tortilla is more popular but in northern Mexico, where it originated, the flour tortilla may be as popular, if not more popular, than the corn tortilla. Flour tortillas are commonly filled with meat, chopped potatoes, refried beans, cheese, hot sauce and other ingredients to make dishes such as tacos, quesadillas and burritos (a dish originating in the Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico / El Paso, Texas area). = United States, U.S. territories and Northern Mexico = In Northern Mexico and much of the United States, \\"tortillas\\" mean wheat-flour tortillas. They are the foundation of Mexican border cooking. Their popularity was driven by the low cost of inferior grades of wheat flour provided to border markets and by their ability to keep and ship well.California Mexican-Spanish Cook Book; Selected Mexican and Spanish Recipes, by Bertha Haffner-Ginger, Citizen Print Shop, Los Angeles, 1914.

These are about 5mm thick and about 10cm in diameter, just like Mexican gorditas. Although they superficially resemble pupusas, they are quite different (burn marks, for instance, are different) Tortillas in Central America sometimes differ somewhat from their Mexican counterparts, although are made similarly. In Guatemala and El Salvador, the tortillas are about 5 millimeters thick and about 10 centimeters in diameter, just like Mexican gorditas. Like the Mexican tortillas, the maize is soaked in a mixture of water and lime (or lye), then rinsed and ground. In El Salvador, they sometimes use sorghum (called maicillo there) to make tortillas when there is not enough maize. Also in El Salvador, there is a particularly large and thick tortilla called a \\"chenga\\"Meza, Joaqu√≠n, Real Diccionario de la Vulgar Lengua Guanaca, , p 178 on top of which food is placed, like an edible plate, to serve food to the labourers in coffee plantations and farms. Honduras is well known for using wheat flour tortillas to make baleadas, which consist of a wheat flour tortilla, folded in half, with various items (beans, cream, scrambled eggs) put inside. Maize and wheat tortillas can often be found in supermarkets in El Salvador and Costa Rica produced by Mexican companies. Stuffed tortillas known as pupusas are also a famous dish of traditional Salvadoran cuisine. = United States = Tortillas are widely used in the United States, in recipes of Mexican origin and many others. As a testament to their popularity, the Tortilla Industry Association (TIA) estimated Americans consumed approximately 85 billion tortillas in 2000 (not including tortilla chips). They are more popular than all other ethnic breads such as English muffins, pita bread, and bagels.TIA news first quarter 2001 Tortilla chips ‚Äî made from maize tortillas cut into wedges, then fried ‚Äî first gained popularity in the 1940s in Los Angeles, California and were mass- produced there.

They are also used to make fajitas, wraps, sandwiches, casseroles and stews, and there are numerous other uses. Many people from both Northern Mexico and throughout the Southwestern United States eat tortillas as a staple food. Many restaurants use wheat flour tortillas in a variety of non-Mexican and Mexican recipes.

Background This edition was marked by the previous controversy around the Langlois affair. On February 9, 1968 a meeting of the board of directors of the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise (a non-profit organization), in which the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and of the Centre national du cin√©ma et de l'image anim√©e (which depended on the latter) decided to remove Henri Langlois, director and co-founder of the Cin√©math√®que, from his position. Even though they were not a majority, Langlois supporters such as Fran√ßois Truffaut refused to cast their vote. Andr√© Malraux, the French Minister of Culture, had prompted this decision because he wanted to implement managerial changes to gain more influence in the institution. After another vote Pierre Barbin, director of the Tours and Annecy film festivals, became the new director. Langlois was a very popular and beloved figure and this decision sparked a number of protests and demonstrations by filmmakers of the French New Wave, as well as actors, critics and fans who demonstrated in front of the Cin√©math√®que at the Palais de Chaillot on February 12. Many internationally acclaimed film directors like Charles Chaplin, Stanley Kubrick, Roberto Rossellini, Orson Welles and Luis Bu√±uel also sent letters in support of Langlois and even threatened to retrieve the copies of their films previously given to the Cinemath√©que. On February 14, another demonstration took place but this time artists were joined by Sorbonne University students in what was a prelude of what was going to happen in the following months. French filmmakers decided to form the Committee for the Defense of the Cin√©math√®que. At this point, the issue was no longer cultural and had become political. After long negotiations, on April 22, a special meeting of the general assembly of the Cin√©math√®que was called and voted to reinstate Langlois, with the approval of Malraux who also pulled the government‚Äôs representatives from the assembly but in exchange cut public funding to a minimum. The Festival The festival opened on May 10 with the 70 mm restored version of Gone with the Wind, directed by Victor Fleming. American film actress and Princess of Monaco, Grace Kelly served as the host of the opening and closing ceremonies. Personalities of French cinema were sensitive to the demonstrations which were taking place in Paris. On the night of May 10 to May 11, violent clashes between students and the police took place in the Latin Quarter in what became the first night of the barricades. Following these incidents, the French Critics Association issued a statement asking the participants of the festival to join the demonstration of support for striking students scheduled on May 13 and called for the suspension of the festival and for those in Cannes to support the students in their \\"protest against the violent police repression which is an assault on the nation's cultural liberty, the secular traditions of its universities and its democratic principles\\". However, the organization refused. On May 17, in Paris the √âtats g√©n√©raux du cin√©ma, a general assembly of cinema professionals, called for the Cannes Festival to be stopped. Peter Lennon's documentary Rocky Road to Dublin was screened at the festival. It was the last film to be shown. The next day on May 18, a panel discussion of the members of the Committee for the Defense of the Cin√©math√®que was organized to discuss the Langlois affair, with the presence of directors Jean-Luc Godard, Jean-Gabriel Albicocco, Claude Berri and actor Jean-Pierre L√©aud. The discussions were lively and Fran√ßois Truffaut, who had arrived from Paris the day before, explained that while the trains are blocked and the factories on strike, it would be ridiculous to continue the festival. Jean-Luc Godard believed that with this interruption, the cinema will show its solidarity with the student movements. Claude Lelouch, Jean-Claude Carri√®re, actress Macha M√©ril as well as jury members Louis Malle and Roman Polanski, joined them to announce in a press conference in the salle Jean Cocteau at the old Palais Croisette that, in solidarity with the workers and the students who were protesting across France, the festival had to be put to an end. Subsequently, Louis Malle, Monica Vitti, Roman Polanski, and Terence Young resigned from the international jury while Alain Resnais, Claude Lelouch, Carlos Saura, and Milo≈° Forman asked for the withdrawal of their films of the competition. Louis Malle announced that \\"the jury is out of state to work\\". Polanski was skeptical of these measures because those methods reminded him of what Communists did in his native Poland but ended up supporting the annulment of that year's festival. Also, jury member Vsevolod Rozhdestvensky, a poet from the Soviet Union, considered the idea of cancelling the festival so heinous that he even refused to attend the emergency jury meeting. Director Robert Favre Le Bret claimed: \\"We will close the festival tomorrow at midday\\". That same evening, Peppermint Frapp√© by Carlos Saura, was the only film pending to be screened. Saura, accompanied by his then girlfriend and protagonist of the film, Geraldine Chaplin, did not want his own film to be watched. However, despite his total opposition the projection began. Saura and Chaplin jumped onstage and yelled asking not to start the projector to the audience's shock. As Favre Le Bret gave the order to open the big curtain that covered the screen, Saura and Chaplin decided to hung on from the curtains to prevent them from pulling back. At this point, they were joined by Truffaut and Godard. The film was not shown and this started a heated discussion and then a physical altercation with the audience who wanted to watch the film. As a punishment for all his actions, Truffaut was later declared persona non grata by the organization. Finally on May 19 at 12 p.m. and five days before the established end of the festival, the board of directors leaded by Robert Favre Le Bret voted unanimously to cancel this edition, not awarding any prize. From the 28 films that were selected to compete for the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film, only 11 were screened.  Jury  The following people were appointed as the Jury of the 1968 feature film competition: Feature films *Andr√© Chamson (France) - Jury President *Monica Vitti (Italy) *Claude Aveline (France) *Boris von Borresholm (West Germany) *Veljko Bulajiƒá (Yugoslavia) *Paul Cadeac d'Arbaud (France) *Jean Lescure (France) *Louis Malle (France) *Jan Nordlander (Sweden) *Roman Polanski (Poland) *Robert Rozhdestvensky (Soviet Union) *Terence Young (United Kingdom) Official selection =In competition - Feature film= The following films were due to compete for the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film: * Seduto alla sua destra by Valerio Zurlini * Vingt- quatre heures de la vie d'une femme by Dominique Delouche * Anna Karenina by Aleksandr Zarkhi * Banditi a Milano by Carlo Lizzani * Charlie Bubbles by Albert Finney * Csillagosok, katon√°k by Mikl√≥s Jancs√≥ * Das Schlo√ü by Rudolf Noelte * Doktor Glas by Mai Zetterling * Feldobott k√∂ by S√°ndor S√°ra * F√©nyes szelek by Mikl√≥s Jancs√≥ * Grazie, zia by Salvatore Samperi * Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush by Clive Donner * Ho≈ô√≠, m√° panenko by Milo≈° Forman * I protagonisti by Marcello Fondato * Je t'aime, je t'aime by Alain Resnais * Joanna by Mike Sarne * Les Gauloises bleues by Michel Cournot * Mali vojnici by Bahrudin ƒåengiƒá * O slavnosti a hostech by Jan Nƒõmec * Peppermint Frapp√© by Carlos Saura * Petulia by Richard Lester * Rozmarn√© l√©to by Ji≈ô√≠ Menzel * Tuvia Vesheva Benotav by Menahem Golan * The Girl on a Motorcycle by Jack Cardiff * The Long Day's Dying by Peter Collinson * Trilogy by Frank Perry * Yabu no naka no kuroneko by Kaneto Shind≈ç * Zywot Mateusza by Witold Leszczy≈Ñski =Films out of competition= The following films were selected to be screened out of competition: * Gone with the Wind by Victor Fleming * Toby Dammit by Federico Fellini * Metzengerstein by Roger Vadim * William Wilson by Louis Malle Parallel sections =International Critics' Week= The following feature films were selected to be screened for the 7th International Critics' Week (7e Semaine de la Critique): * Ang√®le (Quatre d‚Äôentre elles) by Yves Yersin (Switzerland) * Concerto pour un exil by D√©sir√© Ecar√© (France, Ivory Coast) * The Edge by Robert Kramer (United States) * Les enfants de N√©ant by Michel Brault (France) * Falling Leaves (Giorgobistve) by Otar Iosseliani (Soviet Union) * How Long Does a Man Live?

On June 14, 1968, French filmmakers like Fran√ßois Truffaut and Louis Malle, among others, took the opportunity to found the Soci√©t√© des R√©alisateurs de Films (SRF) whith the mission of \\"defending artistic, moral and professional and economic freedoms of cinematographic creation and participating in the development of new structures of the cinema\\". In the next year's edition of the festival, it started to organize a parallel selection to the official one called Directors' Fortnight. In the 2008 edition, forty years later, some of the works that could not be screened at the time were restored: Peppermint Frapp√© by Carlos Saura, 24 Hours in the Life of a Woman by Dominique Delouche, Anna Karenina by Alexandre Zarkhi and The Long Day's Dying by Peter Collinson. 13 jours en France by Claude Lelouch and Fran√ßois Reichenbach was also shown even though it was not part of the official selection.

He served as a Confederate general during the American Civil War, and afterward was greatly involved in railroad development in the Southern United States. Early life and career Thomas M. Logan was born in 1840 in Charleston, South Carolina. Logan's family is of ancient Scottish descent.Evans, 1899, p.411 He was the son of George William Logan, a local judge, and Anna D'Oyley Glover; a sister was the painter Lillie Logan. His great-great grandfather was Christian Thomassen Muldrup, His Danish Majesty's Consul for Scotland and the North of England, born 1721 and married to Honoria Bray. Logan received his education at South Carolina College, located in Columbia. He graduated in 1860, standing first in his class.Warner, pp. 189-90. Civil War service When the American Civil War began in 1861, Logan chose to follow his home state of South Carolina and the Confederate cause. He volunteered for the Washington Light Infantry, which participated in the Battle of Fort Sumter on April 12-13. Later that month he was appointed a second lieutenant in the Confederate Army, and in May he was promoted to first lieutenant and joined Wade Hampton's Legion. Logan was assigned to Company A of the unit, which had been formed in Charleston.Eicher, p. 352. Early photograph of Logan Following the Confederate victory at the First Battle of Bull Run in July, Logan was promoted to the rank of captain.Warner, p. 190. He fought during the Seven Days Battles in the spring of 1862, and was wounded in a foot at the Battle of Gaines' Mill on June 27. Logan also fought during the Second Battle of Bull Run on August 28-30\\\\. He was cited for \\"great bravery\\" during the Battle of Antietam on September 17, and was promoted to major from that date. That December Logan was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Logan served in Brig. Gen. Micah Jenkins brigade in 1863, taking part in the Suffolk Operations that spring. He then went with the rest of the First Corps units to the Western Theater. Logan participated in the Battle of Chickamauga and Knoxville Campaign that winter, missing the Battle of Chattanooga. On May 19, 1864, Logan was promoted to colonel. Logan was wounded for the second time during the Battle of Riddells' Shop on June 13, 1864. He was appointed a temporary brigadier general on December 1, but it was not confirmed by the Confederate Congress, and reverted to a colonel. However, during that short time Logan was the youngest general officer in the Confederate Army. In early 1865 Logan served with Hampton during the Carolinas Campaign, and was promoted to brigadier general on February 15.Wright, p. 125. Appointed from South Carolina on February 23, 1865, to rank from February 15, and confirmed by Confederate Congress February 23. He served in Petersburg as well as fighting in the Battle of Bentonville from March 19-21\\\\. Logan surrendered along with the rest of Hampton's forces on April 9, and was paroled on May 1 from Greensboro, North Carolina.Wright, p. 125. Postbellum career Logan after the Civil War After the end of the war in 1865, Logan returned home to his civilian life. That May he borrowed $5 USD from a friend and married Kate Virginia Cox (1840-1915), the daughter of James H. Cox, a judge from Chesterfield County, Virginia. The couple would have nine children, but were survived by only a son and three daughters.NY Times obituary, Warner, p. 190,ABuilder of the New South, Lily Logan Morrill, The Christopher Publishing House, 1940. Logan began to study law and entered into the railroad industry. After the Civil War, he became president of the Port Walthall spur line of the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad. The spur was destroyed in the War and never restored. He was then the \\"principal organizer\\" of what would become the Southern Railway, and was often associated in businesses with American industrialist/philanthropist John D. Rockefeller. Entering politics as well, Logan was part of the Virginia Democratic Executive Committee in 1879 and the Virginia \\"Gold Democrat\\" party in 1896, serving both as their chairman. Logan died in 1914 at his apartment in New York City, New York, due to a \\"complication of diseases.\\" His body was buried in Hollywood Cemetery, located in Richmond, Virginia, following a funeral on August 12.

They possess features of relative and absolute configuration that are characteristic of their class and have been extensively studied; but these features are not clearly displayed by general methods of stereochemical nomenclature, so that special methods of specifying their configuration are justified and have long been used. In other than stereochemical respects, their nomenclature should follow the general rules of organic chemistry.  Aminocyclitol natural products  The aminocyclitol family of natural products is a class of sugar-derived microbial secondary metabolites that demonstrate significant biological activities. Aminocyclitols are found as a component of aminoglycoside antibiotics which is also called as pseudosugars or pseudosaccharides. Aminocyclitols have chemical structures of a carbon ring with amine functional group(s). The class of aminocyclitol containing natural products can be divided by ring sizes or types of precursors. = Five-membered ring aminocyclitols = pactamycin = Six-membered ring aminocyclitols = * 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose derived aminoglycosides This class includes kanamycin, neomycin, gentamicin, apramycin, hygromycin. * myo-inositol 1-phosphate derived aminoglycosides This class includes streptomycin, spectinomycin. * sedoheptulose 7-phosphate derived C7N aminocyclitol natural products This class includes acarbose, validamycin, validoxylamine A, salbostatin, cetoniacytone A, pyralomicin 1a, kirkamide  Biosynthesis of C7N aminocyclitols  Sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, a pentose phosphate pathway intermediate, is a common precursor of C7N aminocyclitol moiety of natural products, such as acarbose, validamycin A, salbostatin, cetoniacytone A, and pyralomicin 1a. 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase (EEVS), one of the sugar phosphate cyclase family enzyme and which is a homolog of 3-dehydroquinate synthase in shikimate pathway, catalyzes the formation of a common intermediate, 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone from sedoheptulose 7-phosphate. After multiple enzyme reaction steps, which include phosphorylation, epimerization, dehydration, and keto-reduction reactions, valienol, an important core structure is formed which leads to the formation of C7N aminocyclitol containing natural products. In validamycin biosynthesis, the C-N linkage which connect the C7 cyclitol moiety to the other was found to be formed by unprecedented actions of nucleotidyltransferase and glycosyltransferase-like enzymes (which is termed pseudoglycosyltransferase).

Its emphasis was on straightforward forecasts. The program aired for a half-hour on weekend mornings from 4:30am-5am ET, and had the shortest runtime of any forecast program on the network. It was also the lowest viewed show on TWC since it was shown at a very early time and on a weekend. Sunrise Weather launched on September 20, 2008, replacing the first half hour of the now defunct Weekend Outlook. It placed more emphasis on hard weather forecasts than most other TWC shows. When the show launched, Ray Stagich co-anchored with Mike Seidel on Saturdays and Alex Wallace on Sundays. In September 2009, Seidel left to cover College/NFL games for TWC, and was replaced by Jeff Morrow. In July 2012, Wallace left for First Outlook, and was replaced by Danielle Banks. In October 2012, Morrow left TWC. Banks and Stagich started anchoring both Saturday and Sunday together until November 2013, when Banks left for Weekend Now and Weather Center Live, and was not replaced. The show was hosted by meteorologist Ray Stagich solely. If there was a major weather event, Sunrise Weather would be pre-empted by an extended edition of Weekend View. On November 10, 2013, Sunrise Weather aired for the final time. It has since been replaced by the new all-day Weather Center Live program, which was part of the 2013 relaunch of the Weather Channel.

After graduation, he worked as a painter under his brother, Joseph Hickel, who was also a painter. Beginning in 1779, he served as a traveling portrait painter. He spent considerable time in Munich where he painted Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria, among others. He then traveled in southern Germany, Switzerland, then to Mannheim and Mainz. He moved to Switzerland in 1785, and then became the official court painter of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1786, he travelled to France where he painted under the patronage of Marie Antoinette and Marie-Louise, princesse de Lamballe. He died in Hamburg.

Voltages applied to a stack of metal plates create the electric field reflecting the ions back to the flight tube. A reflectron (mass reflectron) is a type of time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF MS) that comprises a pulsed ion source, field-free region, ion mirror, and ion detector and uses a static or time dependent electric field in the ion mirror to reverse the direction of travel of the ions entering it. Using the reflectron, one can substantially diminish a spread of flight times of the ions with the same mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) caused by spread in kinetic energy of these ions measured at the exit from the ion source. Development In the reflection, the higher energy ion (red) takes a longer path but arrives at the detector at the same time as the lower energy ion (blue) of the same mass. The idea of improving mass resolution in TOF MS by implementing the reflection of ions from a region with retarding electric field (the ion mirror) has been first proposed by Russian scientist S. G. Alikhanov. In 1973, the dual-stage reflectron utilizing an ion mirror with two regions of homogeneous field was built in a laboratory of Boris Aleksandrovich Mamyrin. Mass resolution of the reflectron measured over broad mass range is much larger than that in a simpler (so-called linear) time-of-flight mass spectrometer comprising a pulsed ion source, flight tube, and ion detector. The masses of ions analyzed in the reflectron can span from a few Daltons to a few million Daltons. Sensitivity in the reflectron used for the analysis of ions produced in vacuum by photo or electron ionization, e.g., matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization source, can be lower than in linear TOF MS due to post-source decay - a dissociation of vibrationally- excited molecular ions (often referred as metastable ions). Single-stage reflectron Schematic drawing of a single-stage reflectron. A single-stage reflectron is equipped with an ion mirror that has a single electric field region. The distribution of electric potential along the central axis of the ion mirror can be linear or non-linear. Also, the electric field in the mirror can be constant or time-dependent. In single-stage reflectrons with homogeneous field, a zero field in a field-free region of a flight tube and the homogeneous field inside the ion mirror are separated by highly transparent (~95%) metal grid. The grid position is then referred as the entrance (exit) to the ion mirror and is used to calculate the retarding electric field. The single-stage reflector utilizing homogeneous field can be used to attain high mass resolution in cases where the variation of energies of ions leaving the ion source is small (typically less than a few per cent). Time of flight t of the ions with mass m, charge q, kinetic energy U is :t(U) = \\\\frac{L}{\\\\sqrt{2U}} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{m}{q}}\\\\ + \\\\frac{2 L_{m}\\\\sqrt{2U}}{U_{m}} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{m}{q}}\\\\ where L is the path length of the ions in a field-free space, Lm is the length of ion mirror, Um is the voltage applied across the mirror. To find a first-order compensation condition for flight time t with respect to spread dU in ion energy U, the following condition should be fulfilled :\\\\frac{dt}{dU} = 0 Assume that the kinetic energy of the ions in the field-free region equals the ion potential energy near the stop point of the ions inside the mirror (we assume that this stop point is very close to the back electrode of the mirror, i.e. Um = U). From here it follows that :L_{m} = \\\\frac{L}{4} In practice, the mirror length should be 10-20% longer to accommodate all ions whose kinetic energy is spread over some interval. So, the electric field Em in the mirror of a single-stage reflector should be :E_{m} = \\\\frac{4U}{L} In case of a wider variation of dU, the relative width of the time-of-flight peaks dt/t in such a reflectron is determined by the uncompensated part of the flight time t(U) proportional to the second derivative :\\\\frac{dt}{t} = k \\\\frac{d^2t}{dU^2}. where k is a constant depending on the parameters of the single-stage reflector. Dual-stage reflectron Schematic drawing of an ion mirror with high- and low-field regions (dual-stage reflectron). The mirror in a dual-stage reflectron has two regions (stages) with different fields. This makes it possible to zero both the first and second derivatives of t(U) with respect to energy U. That is why dual-stage reflectrons can compensate flight times over larger variations in ion kinetic energy compared to single-stage ones. This type of reflectrons is typically employed in orthogonal acceleration (oa) TOF MS. \\"Classical\\" (i.e., Mamyrin's) design includes two highly transparent conductive grids separating regions with homogeneous fields. In general, the first stage (section) of the reflectron has high electric field, in this section the ions decelerate losing 2/3 or more of their kinetic energy depending on the reflectron parameters; the second stage has lower field, in this stage the ions are repelled toward the first region. Mass resolution in dual-stage reflectron is mainly determined by ion scattering on the grids, the spread of kinetic energy of ions leaving the pulsed ion source, and accuracy of mechanical alignment. To diminish effect of scattering, the length of the first deceleration region should be relatively large. Ion scattering makes using triple- and further stage reflectrons impractical. The effect of ion scattering on mass resolution in single- and dual-stage reflectrons can be diminished by utilizing polarized grid geometry.D.S. Selby, V. Mlynski, M. Guilhaus, Demonstrating the effect of the ‚Äòpolarised grid geometry‚Äô for orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometers, Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry, 14(7), 616 (2000). Gridless reflectron The gridless design of the reflectron usually comprises two stages with individually adjustable voltages: a decelerating region, where the ions lose about two-thirds of their kinetic energy, and repelling region, where the ions reverse their direction of motion. The symmetry of gridless reflectron is typically a cylindrical one, though a 2D design comprising two parallel flat electrode systems can be utilized for the same purpose of flight-time compensation of energy spread the ions acquire at the exit from the ion source. The gridless reflectron almost always includes a thick electrostatic Einzel lens placed at its front or some distance. The curved potential distribution in a gridless reflectron geometrically affects the trajectories of reflected ions and therefore the gridless reflectron either focus or defocus the ions, which depends on a chosen field profile. In addition, one needs to take into account that the lensing also affects the time-of-flight of ions traversing different sections of the reflectron. Due to the positive voltages in the reflectron with respect to that applied to the field-free drift region (this region is often kept at the ground potential), the reflectron entrance acts like the first half of a \\"positive\\" electrostatic lens (Einzel lens where the central electrode is kept at a positive potential with respect to two outer electrodes) causing the ion beam to diverge when entering the reflectron. A positive (decelerating) lens affects the ion flight times as well as the spread of ion flight times (on-axis vs. off-axis ions) more strongly than a negative (accelerating) lens does under similar focusing conditions because in positive Einzel lens the ions are moving along the extended (i.e., more lengthy) off-axis trajectories at lower ion energies. To minimize the positive lens effect produced by the gridless reflectron, one must add a negative Einzel lens near the reflectron exit, which conducts the geometric focusing, i.e., directs the converging ion beam toward the ion detector and compensate for the flight time spread. The reflectron with the negative Einzel lens placed near its exit is sometimes referred as the Frey mirror.Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer Using an Ion Reflector, R. Frey and E. Schlag, 1986 As earlier as 1985, Frey et al. reported on the gridless reflector that demonstrated mass resolution over 10,000 while mass analyzing the laser-ablated plumes that exhibited 3.3% kinetic energy spread at the exit of the ion source. In the 1980s, there were suggested several approaches to a design of gridless reflectrons, mainly aimed at finding the middle ground between higher transmission (i.e., directing a significant per cent of exiting ions toward the ion detector) and target mass resolution. One implementation of gridless reflectron utilizes a curved field where the electric potential V(x) along the mirror axis depends non-linearly on distance x to the mirror entrance. Time of flight compensation for ions with different kinetic energy can be obtained by adjusting voltage on the elements producing the electric field inside the mirror, which values follow the equation of an arc of a circle: R2 = V(x)2 \\\\+ kx2, where k and R are some constants. The electric potential in some other implementation of gridless reflectron (a so-called quadratic-field reflectron) is proportional to a square of a distance x to the mirror entrance: V(x)= kx2 thus exhibiting a case of one-dimensional harmonic field. If both the ion source and the detector are placed at the reflectron entrance and if the ions travel in a close proximity of the ion mirror axis, the flight times of ions in the quadratic-field reflectron are almost independent on ion kinetic energy. A gridless reflectron with nonlinear field, which comprised only three cylindrical elements was also demonstrated. Bergmann et al. implemented an original numerical approach to finding voltage distribution across the stack of the metal electrodes to create a nonlinear field in different regions of the reflectron to provide conditions for both geometrical focusing and compensation of flight times caused by the spread of kinetic energies of ions entering the reflectron at different angles. Post- source decay A post-source decay (PSD) is a process specific to the ion source utilizing matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and operating in vacuum. In the post-source decay, parent ions (typically of several keV kinetic energy) fragment in a process of laser-induced fragmentation or high- energy collision-induced dissociation (HE CID). Time interval suitable for observation of the post-source decay in the reflectron starts after the precursors (parent ions) leave the ion source and ends prior to the moment when the precursors enter the ion mirror. The kinetic energy of fragment ions of mass m in the post-source decay significantly differs from that of parent ions of mass M and is proportional to m/M. So, the distribution of kinetic energies for the PSD ions is extremely large. Not surprisingly, it cannot be compensated in \\"classic\\" single or double-stage reflectrons. To achieve acceptable mass resolution for PSD ions with masses typically distributed over broad mass range, these ions are accelerated to energies substantially (at least, a factor of 4 ) exceeding the initial energy of precursor ions. Use of gridless curved-field mirror or that with time-dependent field also improves the mass resolution for fragment ions generated in the post-source decay.

It is commonly applied to beliefs and practices surrounding luck, prophecy, and certain spiritual beings, particularly the belief that future events can be foretold by specific (apparently) unrelated prior events.

Items referred to as such in common parlance are commonly referred to as folk belief in folkloristics.For discussion, see for example Georges, Robert A. & Jones, Michael Owen. 1995. Folkloristics: An Introduction, p. 122. Indiana University Press. . Etymology The word superstition was first used in English in the 15th century, borrowed from French superstition which continues Latin superstitio. The earliest known use as an English noun is found in Friar Daw's Reply (ca. 1420), where the foure general synnes are enumerated as Cediciouns, supersticions, √æe glotouns, & √æe proude. While the formation of the Latin word is clear, from the verb super-stare, \\"to stand over, stand upon; survive\\", its original intended sense is less clear. It can be interpreted as \\"‚Äòstanding over a thing in amazement or awe\\",\\"orig. a standing still over or by a thing; hence, amazement, wonder, dread, esp. of the divine or supernatural.\\" Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary. but other possibilities have been suggested, e.g. the sense of excess, i.e. over scrupulousness or over-ceremoniousness in the performing of religious rites, or else the survival of old, irrational religious habits.. The earliest known use as a noun is found in Plautus, Ennius and later by Pliny, with the meaning of art of divination. From its use in the Classical Latin of Livy and Ovid, it is used in the pejorative sense that it holds today, of an excessive fear of the gods or unreasonable religious belief, as opposed to religio, the proper, reasonable awe of the gods. Cicero derived the term from superstitiosi, lit. those who are \\"left over\\", i.e. \\"survivors\\", \\"descendants\\", connecting it with excessive anxiety of parents in hoping that their children would survive them to perform their necessary funerary rites.Cicero, De Natura Deorum II, 28 (32), quoted in While Cicero distinguishes between religio and superstitio, Lucretius uses only the word religio (only with pejorative meaning). Throughout all of his work, he distinguished only between ratio and religio. The Latin verb superstare itself is comparatively young, being \\"perhaps not ante-Augustan\\", first found in Livy, and the meaning \\"to survive\\" is even younger, found in late or ecclesiastical Latin, for the first time in Ennodius. The use of the noun by Cicero and Horace thus predates the first attestation of the verb. It doesn't exclude that the verb might have been used after the name. The word superstitio, or superstitio vana \\"vain superstition\\", was applied in the 1st century to the officially outlawed religious cults in the Roman Empire. This concerned the religion of the druids in particular, which was described as a superstitio vana by Tacitus, and Early Christianity, outlawed as a superstitio Iudaica in AD 80 by Domitian. Superstition and religion Greek and Roman polytheists, who modeled their relations with the gods on political and social terms, scorned the man who constantly trembled with fear at the thought of the gods, as a slave feared a cruel and capricious master. Such fear of the gods was what the Romans meant by \\"superstition\\" (Veyne 1987, p. 211). Diderot's Encyclop√©die defines superstition as \\"any excess of religion in general\\", and links it specifically with paganism. In his Prelude on the Babylonian Captivity of the Church, Martin Luther (who called the papacy \\"that fountain and source of all superstitions\\") accuses the popes of superstition: > For there was scarce another of the celebrated bishoprics that had so few > learned pontiffs; only in violence, intrigue, and superstition has it > hitherto surpassed the rest. For the men who occupied the Roman See a > thousand years ago differ so vastly from those who have since come into > power, that one is compelled to refuse the name of Roman pontiff either to > the former or to the latter. The current Catechism of the Catholic Church considers superstition sinful in the sense that it denotes \\"a perverse excess of religion\\", as a demonstrated lack of trust in divine providence (¬∂ 2110), and a violation of the first of the Ten Commandments. The Catechism is a defense against the accusation that Catholic doctrine is superstitious: > Superstition is a deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this > feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we offer the true God, e.g., > when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices > otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of > sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the > interior dispositions that they demand is to fall into superstition. Cf. ' > (¬∂ 2111) Examples of superstitions and taboos from a November 1941 issue of Weird Tales. Superstition and psychology = Origins = Behaviorism perspective In 1948, behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner published an article in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, in which he described his pigeons exhibiting what appeared to be superstitious behaviour. One pigeon was making turns in its cage, another would swing its head in a pendulum motion, while others also displayed a variety of other behaviours. Because these behaviors were all done ritualistically in an attempt to receive food from a dispenser, even though the dispenser had already been programmed to release food at set time intervals regardless of the pigeons' actions, Skinner believed that the pigeons were trying to influence their feeding schedule by performing these actions. He then extended this as a proposition regarding the nature of superstitious behavior in humans. Skinner's theory regarding superstition being the nature of the pigeons' behaviour has been challenged by other psychologists such as Staddon and Simmelhag, who theorised an alternative explanation for the pigeons' behaviour. Despite challenges to Skinner's interpretation of the root of his pigeons' superstitious behaviour, his conception of the reinforcement schedule has been used to explain superstitious behaviour in humans. Originally, in Skinner's animal research, \\"some pigeons responded up to 10,000 times without reinforcement when they had originally been conditioned on an intermittent reinforcement basis.\\"Schultz & Schultz (2004, 238). Compared to the other reinforcement schedules (e.g., fixed ratio, fixed interval), these behaviours were also the most resistant to extinction. This is called the partial reinforcement effect, and this has been used to explain superstitious behaviour in humans. To be more precise, this effect means that, whenever an individual performs an action expecting a reinforcement, and none seems forthcoming, it actually creates a sense of persistence within the individual. This strongly parallels superstitious behaviour in humans because the individual feels that, by continuing this action, reinforcement will happen; or that reinforcement has come at certain times in the past as a result of this action, although not all the time, but this may be one of those times.  Evolutionary/cognitive perspective  From a simpler perspective, natural selection will tend to reinforce a tendency to generate weak associations or heuristics that are overgeneralized. If there is a strong survival advantage to making correct associations, then this will outweigh the negatives of making many incorrect, \\"superstitious\\" associations. It has also been argued that there may be connections between OCD and superstition.de Silva, Padmal and Rachman, Stanley (2004) Obsessive- compulsive Disorder, Oxford University Press, p. 34, . This may be connected to hygiene. A recent theory by Jane Risen proposes that superstitions are intuitions that people acknowledge to be wrong, but acquiesce to rather than correct when they arise as the intuitive assessment of a situation. Her theory draws on dual-process models of reasoning. In this view, superstitions are the output of \\"System 1\\" reasoning that are not corrected even when caught by \\"System 2\\". = Mechanisms = People seem to believe that superstitions influence events by changing the likelihood of currently possible outcomes rather than by creating new possible outcomes. In sporting events, for example, a lucky ritual or object is thought to increase the chance that an athlete will perform at the peak of their ability, rather than increasing their overall ability at that sport. Consequently, people whose goal is to perform well are more likely to rely on \\"supernatural assistance\\" - lucky items and rituals - than are people whose goal is to improve their skills and abilities and learn in the same context. Psychologist Stuart Vyse has pointed out that until about 2010, \\"[m]ost researchers assumed superstitions were irrational and focused their attentions on discovering why people were superstitious.\\" Vyse went on to describe studies that looked at the relationship between performance and superstitious rituals. Preliminary work has indicated that such rituals can reduce stress and thereby improve performance, but, Vyse has said, \\"...not because they are superstitious but because they are rituals.... So there is no real magic, but there is a bit of calming magic in performing a ritualistic sequence before attempting a high- pressure activity.... Any old ritual will do.\\" = Occurrence = People tend to attribute events to supernatural causes (in psychological jargon, \\"external causes\\") most often under two circumstances. # People are more likely to attribute an event to a superstitious cause if it is unlikely than if it is likely. In other words, the more surprising the event, the more likely it is to evoke a supernatural explanation. This is believed to stem from an effectance motivation - a basic desire to exert control over one's environment. When no natural cause can explain a situation, attributing an event to a superstitious cause may give people some sense of control and ability to predict what will happen in their environment. # People are more likely to attribute an event to a superstitious cause if it is negative than positive. This is called negative agency bias. Boston Red Sox fans, for instance, attributed the failure of their team to win the world series for 86 years to the curse of the bambino: a curse placed on the team for trading Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees so that the team owner could fund a Broadway musical. When the Red Sox finally won the world series in 2004, however, the team's success was attributed to the team's skill and the rebuilding effort of the new owner and general manager. More commonly, people are more likely to perceive their computer to act according to its own intentions when it malfunctions than functions properly. Superstition and politics Ancient Greek historian Polybius in his Histories uses the word superstition explaining that in ancient Rome that belief maintained the cohesion of the empire, operating as an instrumentum regni.Guy, Josephine M. (2007) The Complete Works of Oscar Wilde, Oxford University Press, Volume IV, p. 337, . Opposition to superstition Opposition to superstition was first recorded in ancient Greece, where philosophers such as Protagoras and the Epicureans exhibited agnosticism or aversion to religion and myths, and Platoespecially his Allegory of the Cave and Aristotle both present their work as parts of a search for truth. In the classical era, the existence of gods was actively debated both among philosophers and theologians, and opposition to superstition arose consequently. The poem ', written by the Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius further developed the opposition to superstition. Cicero‚Äôs work ' also had a great influence on the development of the modern concept of superstition as well as the word itself. Where Cicero distinguished ' and ', Lucretius used only the word '. Cicero, for whom ' meant ‚Äúexcessive fear of the gods‚Äù wrote that ‚Äú' ‚Äù, which means that only superstition, and not religion, should be abolished. The Roman Empire also made laws condemning those who excited excessive religious fear in others. During the Middle Ages, the idea of God's influence on the world's events went mostly undisputed. Trials by ordeal were quite frequent, even though Frederick II (11941250) was the first king who explicitly outlawed trials by ordeal as they were considered ‚Äúirrational‚Äù. The rediscovery of lost classical works (The Renaissance) and scientific advancement led to a steadily increasing disbelief in superstition. A new, more rationalistic lens was beginning to see use in exegesis. Opposition to superstition was central to the Age of Enlightenment. The first philosopher who dared to criticize superstition publicly and in a written form was Baruch Spinoza, who was a key figure in the Age of Enlightenment.  Regional and national superstitions  Most superstitions arose over the course of centuries and are rooted in regional and historical circumstances, such as religious beliefs or the natural environment. For instance, geckos are believed to be of medicinal value in many Asian countries, but not in regions where geckos are not found. In China, Feng shui is a belief system that is said to have a negative effect on different places, e.g. that a room in the northwest corner of a house is \\"very bad\\". Similarly, the number 8 is a \\"lucky number\\" in China, so that it is more common than any other number in the Chinese housing market.

High school and college student sections are numerous across the United States, and many share the same characteristics.  College basketball  Sixth man clubs originated in college basketball, where deep crowds of students assemble to chant for their team.

High school basketball  Sixth man squads assemble themselves together across the United States. Like their collegiate counterparts, high school squads wear matching shirts and name themselves based on their mascot. High school sixth man clubs are able to have the largest impact on the games because the size of the gymnasium is much smaller than its college counterpart. Sixth man squads organize themselves sometimes inches away from the court and work to intimidate their opponents personally. Player-fan interactions occur a lot because of this. This can sometimes backfire, as was the case with former Wisconsin high school player and future NBA player Tyler Herro. Herro, born and raised in Wisconsin, originally committed to play for the University of Wisconsin but later changed his mind and committed to the University of Kentucky. Knowing this, a home crowd's sixth man chanted \\"Traitor\\" at him during a road game and Herro responded with a 45 point game and led his team to a road victory.  Goals and rituals  The \\"sixth man\\" has taken the role of cheering to a higher and more intense level. The main goal is to be so loud that their team gets pumped up, and the opposing team gets intimidated. Most squads choose to stand up during the whole game.

The beginning of the Empire is usually taken as the reign of Gustavus Adolphus, who ascended the throne in 1611, and its end as the loss of territories in 1721 following the Great Northern War. After the death of Gustavus Adolphus in 1632, the empire was controlled for lengthy periods by part of the high nobility, such as the Oxenstierna family, acting as regents for minor monarchs. The interests of the high nobility contrasted with the uniformity policy (i.e., upholding the traditional equality in status of the Swedish estates favoured by the kings and peasantry). In territories acquired during the periods of de facto noble rule, serfdom was not abolished, and there was also a trend to set up respective estates in Sweden proper. The Great Reduction of 1680 put an end to these efforts of the nobility and required them to return estates once gained from the crown to the king. Serfdom, however, remained in force in the dominions acquired in the Holy Roman Empire and in Swedish Estonia, where a consequent application of the uniformity policy was hindered by the treaties by which they were gained. After the victories in the Thirty Years' War, Sweden reached the climax of the great-power era during the Second Northern War, when its primary adversary, Denmark‚ÄìNorway, was neutralized by the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658 (this is when the Swedish empire is at its largest extent). However, in the further course of this war, as well as in the subsequent Scanian War, Sweden was able to maintain its empire only with the support of its closest ally, France. Charles XI of Sweden consolidated the empire. But a decline began with his son, Charles XII. After initial Swedish victories, Charles secured the empire for some time in the Peace of Travendal (1700) and the Treaty of Altranst√§dt (1706), before the disaster that followed the king's war in Russia. The Russian victory at the Battle of Poltava put an end to Sweden's eastbound expansion, and by the time of Charles XII's death in 1718 only a much-weakened and far smaller territory remained. The last traces of occupied continental territory vanished during the Napoleonic Wars, and Finland went to Russia in 1809, with Sweden's role as a great power vanishing as well. In older Swedish history telling, Gustavus Adolphus and especially Charles XII were brave and heroic warriors. Sweden is the only Scandinavian country to have ever reached the status of a military great power.https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110810105745689 Emergence as a great power Sweden emerged as a great European power under Axel Oxenstierna and King Gustavus Adolphus. As a result of acquiring territories seized from Russia and the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, as well as its involvement in the Thirty Years' War, Sweden found itself transformed into the leader of Protestantism. During the Thirty Years' War, Sweden managed to conquer approximately half of the member states of the Holy Roman Empire. The fortunes of war would shift back and forth several times. After its defeat in the Battle of N√∂rdlingen (1634), confidence in Sweden among the Swedish- controlled German states was damaged, and several of the provinces refused further Swedish military support, leaving Sweden with only a couple of northern German provinces. After France intervened on the same side as Sweden, fortunes shifted again. As the war continued, the civilian and military death toll grew, and when it was over, it had led to severe depopulation in the German states. Although exact population estimates do not exist, historians estimate that the population of the Holy Roman Empire fell by one-third as a result of the war. Sweden founded overseas colonies, principally in the New World. New Sweden was founded in the valley of the Delaware River in 1638, and Sweden later laid claim to a number of Caribbean islands. A string of Swedish forts and trading posts was constructed along the coast of West Africa as well, but these were not designed for Swedish settlers. =Peace of Westphalia= At the conclusion of the Thirty Years' War, the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 granted Sweden territories as war reparations. Sweden demanded Silesia, Pomerania (which had been in its possession since the Treaty of Stettin (1630), and a war indemnity of 20,000,000 Riksdaler. Through the efforts of Johan Oxenstierna and Johan Adler Salvius it obtained: * Swedish Pomerania, the Swedish share of the former Duchy of Pomerania since the Treaty of Stettin (1653), consisting of Western Pomerania, with the islands of R√ºgen, Usedom and Wollin, as well as the towns of Stettin, Greifswald, and Stralsund; a strip of Farther Pomerania on the right side of the Oder, including the towns of Damm and Gollnow, with the right of succession to the rest of Farther Pomerania in the case of the extinction of the Brandenburg Hohenzollerns; * the town of Wismar, with the districts of Pod and Neukloster; * the secularized bishoprics of Bremen-Verden, with the town of Wildeshausen; and * 5,000,000 Riksdaler. These German possessions were to be held as fiefs of the Holy Roman Empire. This allowed Sweden a vote in the Imperial Diet and enabled it to \\"direct\\" the Lower Saxon Circle alternately with Brandenburg. France and Sweden, moreover, became joint guarantors of the treaty with the Holy Roman Emperor and were entrusted with carrying out its provisions, as enacted by the executive congress of Nuremberg in 1650. After the peaces of Br√∂msebro and Westphalia, Sweden was the third-largest area of control in Europe by land area, only surpassed by Russia and Spain. Sweden reached its largest territorial extent during this time under the rule of Charles X Gustav (1622‚Äì1660) after the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. Dominions Swedish possessions in 1658. The years in parentheses indicate when the possession was given up or lost. As a result of eighteen years of war, Sweden gained small and scattered possessions, but had secured control of three principal rivers in northern Germany‚Äîthe Oder, the Elbe and the Weser‚Äîand gained toll- collection rights for those important commercial arteries, benefitting the Swedish economy. Two principal reasons for the small reparations were France's envy and Queen Christina's impatience. As a result of Sweden's intervention, Sweden helped secure religious liberty in Europe for Protestants, becoming a leading power of Continental Protestantism for 90 years. The elevation of Sweden to the rank of an imperial power required that it remain a military monarchy, armed for possible emergency. Sweden's poverty and sparse population meant the country was ill-suited for imperial status. However, in the middle of the 17th century, with France as a firm ally, the incompatibility between its powers and its pretensions was not so obvious. Domestic consolidation For the moment, Sweden held a tenuous position of leadership. Careful statesmanship might mean permanent dominion on the Baltic shore, but left little room for mistakes. Unfortunately, the extravagance of Gustavus Adolphus's two immediate successors, Christina and Charles X Gustav, caused great difficulties for the new empire. Christina's financial extravagance brought the state to the verge of bankruptcy, and the financial difficulties caused public unrest before her abdication. The Swedish people feared that the external, artificial greatness of their country might be purchased with the loss of their civil and political liberties. The Swedish people looked to a new king to address the problem of too much power vested in the nobility. The development of Sweden and its empire from 1560 to 1815 Charles X Gustav was a strong arbiter between the people and the nobility. Primarily a soldier, he directed his ambition towards military glory; but he was also an unusually sharp-sighted politician. While placing great emphasis on military strength, he also understood that domestic unity was necessary for a powerful foreign policy. The most pressing domestic question was the reduction, or restitution of alienated crown lands. At the Riksdag of the Estates of 1655, the king proposed that noble holders of crown property should either: 1) pay an annual sum of 200,000 Riksdaler out of the lands they would receive, or 2) surrender a fourth of the property itself, worth approximately 800,000 Riksdaler. The nobility wished to avoid taxation and stipulated that November 6, 1632, the day of Gustavus Adolphus's death, should be the limit to which retrospective taxes could be collected, and that there should be no further restitution of alienated crown property. Against this, the over-taxed lower estates protested, and the Diet had to be suspended. The king intervened, not to quell the commons, as the senate insisted, but to compel the nobility to give way. He proposed a special committee to investigate the matter before the meeting of the next Riksdag and that a proportional contribution should be levied on all classes in the meantime. Both groups accepted this arrangement. Charles X Gustav had done his best to recover from the financial extravagance of Christina. However, his own desire for military glory may have caused problems for his country. In three days, he persuaded the Swedish estates of the potential of his attack on the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. However, when he left Stockholm for Warsaw on July 10, 1654, he gained more personal glory than advantage for his country. The Polish-Swedish War expanded into a general European war. He achieved passage over the Belts and emerged triumphant, only to die of sheer exhaustion. Immediately after his death, a regency was appointed to govern Sweden during the minority of his only son and successor, Charles XI of Sweden, who was four years old. The regency council moved quickly to end the war with Sweden's numerous enemies, which now included the Tsardom of Russia, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Electorate of Brandenburg and Denmark-Norway. Peace of Oliva King Charles X Gustav over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, 1655 The Peace of Oliva on May 3, 1660, put an end to the long feud with Poland. French mediation of this treaty also ended the quarrel between Sweden, the Holy Roman emperor and the elector of Brandenburg. This treaty confirmed both Sweden's possession of Livonia and the elector of Brandenburg's sovereignty over Prussia; and the king of Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth renounced to all claims to the Swedish crown. The treaty compelled Denmark‚ÄìNorway to reopen direct negotiations with Sweden. Eventually, under the Treaty of Copenhagen on May 27, 1660, Sweden kept the three formerly Danish Scanian provinces and the formerly Norwegian Bohusl√§n province, which Denmark-Norway had surrendered by the Treaty of Roskilde two years previously; but Sweden had to relinquish the Norwegian province of Tr√∏ndelag and the Danish island of Bornholm, which had been surrendered at Roskilde. Denmark‚ÄìNorway was also compelled to recognize the independence of the dukes of Holstein-Gottorp. The Russo-Swedish War (1656‚Äì1658) was terminated by the Treaty of Cardis on July 2, 1661, through which the Tsar surrendered the Baltic provinces to Sweden ‚Äî Ingria, Estonia and Kexholm. Thus, Sweden emerged from the war not only a military power, but also one of the largest states of Europe, possessing more than twice as much territory as modern Sweden. The land area of Sweden was 1,100,000 km2. While modern Sweden is bounded by the Baltic, during the 17th century the Baltic formed a bond between various widely dispersed dominions. All the islands in the Baltic, except the Danish group, belonged to Sweden. The estuaries of all the great German rivers lay within Swedish territory, which also included two-thirds of Lake Ladoga and one-half of Lake Peipus. Stockholm, the capital, lay in the very centre of the empire, whose second greatest city was Riga, on the other side of the sea. This empire contained about a quarter of the population of modern Sweden, at only 2,500,000 people, or about 2.3 people per square kilometer. However, Sweden's expansion had been possible partly due to turmoil and weakness in countries in its vicinity, and when they became more stable, they began to look for chances to regain what was lost. Danish defeat King Charles X Gustav Sweden had now won considerable political influence, which was lessened by the loss of moral prestige. On Charles X Gustav's accession in 1655, Sweden's neighbours may have become allies; however, territorial loss combined with the loss of religious liberty lessened their ties to Sweden. At Charles X Gustav's death, five years later, Sweden had not only damaged its newly claimed territories but also had become hated by the surrounding states for its lack of defence of Protestantism. Charles X Gustav's attempt to gain the favour of Brandenburg by dividing Poland not only reversed his original policy, but also created a new southern rival almost as dangerous as Denmark‚ÄìNorway in the west. In 1660, after five years of warfare, Sweden had obtained peace and the opportunity to organize and develop the new vast realm. Unfortunately, the fifteen-year regency that followed Charles X Gustav was unable to manoeuvre through the situation it faced. The administration was internally divided and hindered by the lack of unity and talent among its statesmen. The two major rivals were the military-aristocratic party headed by Magnus de la Gardie and the party of peace and economy led by Johan Gyllenstierna. The aristocratic group prevailed and brought with it a decline of morality which made it notorious to its neighbours. The administration was noted for sloth and carelessness leading to a general neglect of business. Additionally, government corruption led Sweden to be hired by foreign powers. This \\"subsidy policy\\" dates from the Treaty of Fontainebleau of 1661, through which Sweden, in exchange for a considerable sum of money, supported the French candidate for the Polish throne. Sweden was torn between Louis XIV of France and his adversaries in plans to control the Spanish Netherlands. The anti-French faction prevailed; and in April 1668, Sweden acceded to the Triple Alliance, which ended the French acquisitions through the Treaty of Aix-la- Chapelle. For the next four years, Sweden remained true to the Triple Alliance; but, in 1672, Louis XIV succeeded in isolating the Dutch Republic and regaining Sweden as an ally. By the Treaty of Stockholm on April 14, 1672, Sweden entered an agreement with the French to protect its sphere of interest containing the Dutch Republic from hostile German claims in return for 400,000 Riksdaler per annum in peace and 600,000 in wartime. Scanian War In 1674, Louis XIV called upon Sweden to invade the Electorate of Brandenburg. In May 1675, a Swedish army advanced into the Mark but was defeated on June 18 at Fehrbellin and retreated to Swedish Demmin. The Fehrbellin affair was a mere skirmish, with actual casualties numbering fewer than 600 men, but it made Sweden appear vulnerable and enabled neighbouring countries to attack in the Scanian War. At this point, the empire began to crumble. In 1675, Swedish Pomerania and the Duchy of Bremen were taken by the Brandenburgers, Austrians, and Danes. In December 1677, the elector of Brandenburg captured Stettin. Stralsund fell on October 15, 1678. Greifswald, Sweden's last possession on the continent, was lost on November 5. A defensive alliance with John III of Poland was rendered inoperative on August 4, 1677, by the annihilation of Sweden's sea-power; the Battle of √ñland, June 17, 1676; the Battle of Fehmarn, June 1677, and most notable on July 1-July 2 the Battle of K√∏ge Bay. The difficulties concerning the Polish king continued. The Scanian provinces (Scania, Halland and Blegind/Blekinge), once eastern Denmark, became the centre of intense fighting between Swedes and Danes, with a large scale confrontation between the main armies near Lund in December 1676. After that, Scania was divided into Danish and Swedish enclaves centering around the main cities for the rest of the war. The remaining territories in Scania were mainly a no man's land where a fierce \\"little war\\" took place, with Swedish troops on the one side and Danish official and semi-official troops (freeshooters etc.) in conjunction with armed locals. Through homeland military successes of the young Swedish king and the diplomatic activity of Louis XIV, a peace congress began sessions at Nijmegen in March 1677. In the beginning of April 1678, the French king dictated the terms of a peace. One of his chief conditions was the complete restitution of Sweden, as he needed a strong Swedish ally. However, Charles XI refused to go along with ceding territories to its enemies, which led the French king to negotiate on behalf of Sweden without its consent. By the Treaties of Nijmegen on February 7 and of St. Germain on June 29, 1679, Sweden received almost full restitution of its German territory. By the Peace of Fontainebleau confirmed by the subsequent Peace of Lund on September 2, Denmark‚ÄìNorway was to return all the land it had captured to Sweden on October 4, 1679. While Sweden could never have gained these concessions alone, Charles XI formed a personal dislike of the French king and developed a strong anti-French bias. Charles XI The remainder of the reign of Charles XI is remarkable for a revolution, in which the government of Sweden was transformed to a semi-absolute monarchy. The king emerged from the war convinced that if Sweden were to retain its position as a great power, it needed to reform its whole economic system radically and circumscribe the power of the aristocracy. Charles XI felt that he could do it now that he had allies in the lower orders to support him. The Riksdag of Stockholm, October 1680, began a new era of Swedish history. On the motion of the Estate of Peasants, the question of the recovery of the alienated crown lands was brought before the Riksdag, and a resolution of the Diet directed that all countships, baronies, domains, manors and other estates producing an annual rent of more than a certain amount per annum should revert to the Crown. The same Riksdag decided that the king was not bound by any particular constitution, but only by law and statutes, and not even obligated to consult the Privy Council, but was to be regarded as a sovereign lord. The Privy Council changed its official title from Riksr√•d (council of state) to Kungligt r√•d (royal council); a visible sign that the councillors were no longer the king's colleagues, but rather his servants. King Charles XI Thus, Sweden had become an absolute monarchy but enacted the right of the Swedish people, in parliament, to be consulted on all important matters. The Riksdag, completely overshadowed by the Crown, did little more than register the royal decrees during the reign of Charles XI of Sweden; but it continued to exist as an essential part of the government. Moreover, this transfer of authority was a voluntary act. The people, knowing the king to be their ally, trusted and cooperated with him. The Riksdag of 1682 declared that the king was empowered to bestow fiefs and take them back again, making the king the disposer of his subjects' temporal property. Presently, this new principle of autocracy was extended to the king's legislative authority, when on December 9, 1682, all four estates not only confirmed that the king held the legislative powers enjoyed by his predecessors, but even gave him the right of interpreting and amending the common law. The recovery of the alienated crown lands occupied Charles XI for the rest of his life. He created a commission, which was ultimately converted into a permanent department of state. It acted on the principle that the titles of all private landed estates might be called in question, because at some time or other they must have belonged to the Crown, and the burden of proof of ownership lay with the actual owner of the property, not the Crown. The amount of revenue accruing to the Crown from the whole \\"Reduktion\\" is impossible to estimate; but by these means, combined with careful management and rigid economy, Charles XI reduced the national debt by three quarters. Charles XI re-established on a broader basis the reorganization of the \\"indelningsverk\\" ‚Äî a system of military tenure in which national forces were bound to the soil. This tied to the \\"rust hail tenure\\", under which the tenants, instead of paying rent, were obliged to equip and maintain a cavalry soldier and horse; while the knekth√•llare supplied duly equipped foot soldiers. Soldiers were provided with holdings on which they lived in times of peace. Formerly, ordinary conscription had existed alongside this indelning, or distribution system, but it had proved inadequate as well as highly unpopular, and in 1682, Charles XI ended it in favor of an extended distribution system. The Swedish Royal Navy was entirely remodeled; and, the recent war having demonstrated the unsuitability of Stockholm as a naval station, the construction of a new arsenal was begun at Karlskrona. After seventeen years of financial difficulties, the twofold enterprise was completed. At the death of Charles XI, Sweden could boast of a fleet of forty- three three-deckers, manned by 11,000 men and armed with 2,648 guns, and one of the finest arsenals in the world. Charles XII and the Great Northern War Charles XII After Charles XI's death, the throne was inherited by his underage son, Charles XII. After a brief regency, he was declared to be of age to rule. Three years later, in 1700, Denmark‚ÄìNorway, Poland and Russia, the countries that had lost the most territory to Sweden, jointly declared war. Denmark‚ÄìNorway was soon forced to peace after a joint intervention of Swedish, English and Dutch armies, whereafter the King and much of the Swedish army was shipped to the Baltic provinces, where Russian and Polish armies were laying siege to several towns. The Russian army was soundly defeated in the Battle of Narva, after which Charles took the army into Poland with the intent of dethroning the Polish king Augustus II. This took several years, but in 1706, with the Treaty of Altranst√§dt, he reached his goal. In the meantime, Russia had managed to take possession of several towns by the Baltic Sea. Instead of trying to retake these, Charles chose to march directly on Moscow, but due to extreme weather, difficulties with his supply lines and the Russian scorched earth strategy, he was forced to turn towards Ukraine. In 1709, the Swedish army was defeated and captured in the Battle of Poltava; Charles managed to escape south to Bender in the Ottoman Empire. Following the defeat at Poltava, Poland and Denmark re-entered the war, along with other countries wanting parts of the Swedish provinces. In the following years, most of them would fall, and Russia occupied the eastern half of Sweden (present-day Finland). Despite these setbacks, Charles XII twice tried to invade Norway to force Denmark-Norway out of the war again. On November 30, 1718, King Charles XII was mortally wounded during the siege of Fredriksten Fortress in Fredrikshald, today's Halden. With his death, Swedish war efforts mostly came to a halt, although Russia continued to harass the civilian population of the Swedish coastal areas until the concluding Treaty of Nystad was finally signed in 1721. Sweden would remain a regional power of varying success until the 19th century, but the Great Northern War put an end to Sweden's time as a great power. Military history A major reason why Sweden could be so successful in wars with such a scarce number of soldiers was its advanced military tactics. Sweden was able to reform its military tactics continuously throughout the period. Prior to Gustavus Adolphus's reforms, both his father, Charles IX, and his uncle Erik XIV had tried to reform the army but had effectively failed to do so. Charles IX, like most other rulers, had tried to implement the Dutch system into the army but with limited success. The lack of a strict organisation in the infantry caused the proportion of pikemen to musketeers to be far lower than the preferred ratio of 1 to 1. This, combined with the lack of funds to provide the soldiers with armour, caused the Swedish infantry to be dangerously lightly equipped and unable to deal with cavalry or heavier infantry in open terrain. Charles IX was, however, able to implement the Dutch system for fighting in caracole among the cavalry, with unfortunate results. His partially reformed army suffered a disastrous defeat at Kircholm against a Polish-Lithuanian army led by Jan Karol Chodkiewicz. The Hussaria were the last shock cavalry in Europe still fighting with lances, yet they proved with terrifying effect the superiority of aggressive charging compared to the more defensive caracole used in the rest of Europe. In the end, Charles IX's revolt against his nephew Sigismund of Poland and subsequent rise to the throne of Sweden caused a dynastic struggle for the throne of Sweden that would not finally end until the treaty of Oliva in 1660. Gustav II Adolph inherited the Polish war together with the Kalmar War against Denmark‚ÄìNorway when Charles IX died in 1611. The war against Denmark‚ÄìNorway was a terrible loss that forced Sweden to pay a ransom of 1 million silverdaler to regain √Ñlvsborg (final payment, 1619). The Polish war was interrupted by a series of truces caused by Sweden's weakness along with the unwillingness of the Polish nobility to fight a war considered only to be in Sigismund III's personal interest. The costly peace with Denmark and Poland-Lithuania's inability to mount a seaborne attack on the Swedish mainland gave time for Gustavus Adolphus to reform his armies. The continuation of the Polish war in 1625‚Äì1629 gave Gustavus Adolphus the opportunity to test and further improve his army against the Polish-Lithuanian army with its fearsome cavalry, the Winged Hussars. By the time of the Swedish Intervention in the Thirty Years' War in 1630, Gustav II Adolph had transformed the Swedish (Gustavian) army into an army in which the cavalry fought with aggressive shock tactics, closer to the Polish tactics than the Western European. The Caracole and heavy armor were mostly abandoned, and the saber replaced the wheellock pistol as the primary weapon of the cavalry. Horsemen rode knee-by-knee in a tight formation. When in range, they switched to gallop and charged, and at a range of ten yards, shot both their pistols. A standard regiment numbered 250 simultaneous shots that would blast a hole in the enemy ranks. They then continued the charge with sabres (v√§rjor), aiming to break the enemy formation. The infantry was meanwhile employed in a defensive manner, relying on their superior firepower to break enemy attacks. Smaller musketeer detachments (~200 men) were used during the Polish war to support the cavalry against the superior Polish- Lithuanian cavalry. Gustavus Adolphus earned the title \\"father of modern warfare\\" because of his revolutionary tactics during the Thirty Years' War, which later inspired other nations and became standard tactics. He became the foremost model of many later Swedish kings. At the time Finns were an essential part of the Swedish military. Roughly 2/5 of the infantry and 3/7 of the cavalry in the army were from Finland. They served in their own units which used Finnish as their main language. Also commands were given in Finnish. The Finnish cavalry in the Swedish army was called Hakkapeliitat after their battle cry \\"Hakkaa p√§√§lle!\\". Approximately 110 000 soldiers from Finland lost their lives serving the Swedish Empire between 1617‚Äì1721. Taking into account the contemporary number of inhabitants in Finland, it was relatively same than one million casualties in the 20th Century. Gustavus Adolphus. Throughout the Thirty Years' War, the infantry's shock ability was continuously improved. The static nature of the infantry that served well against the cavalry-dominated Polish-Lithuanian army was enhanced during the war to produce infantry capable of both providing devastating firepower and executing offensive maneuvers. Initially, at the Battle of Breitenfeld (1631), the infantry was almost entirely reliant on their firepower and saw very limited offensive use; but under the leadership of Johan Ban√©r, who took command after the defeat at N√∂rdlingen, the Gustavian brigade system was finally changed into the battalion system recognisable from the War of the Spanish Succession and the Great Nordic War (the depth was lowered from six ranks to three or four when the bayonet was introduced at the end of the 17th century). Swedish tactics once again greatly diverged from the continental tactics during the second half of the 17th century. The continental tactics increasingly emphasized the firepower of the battalion, while the Swedish (Carolean) tactics almost exclusively relied on the shock factor as the infantry and cavalry charged the enemy. As the bayonet was introduced, the pike was discarded in all armies except the Swedish and Russian by 1700. In the Swedish army tactics of that time, retreat was never covered, and they were obliged to attack or fight where they stood. This was a military doctrine that (with the advantage of hindsight) might have proven a bit rash. The infantry shock attack operated as follows. The two rear ranks of musketeers were ordered to shoot when \\"you could not miss,\\" a range of roughly 50 meters, and then to draw their swords before the battalion resumed their attack. The two foremost ranks then discharged at a range of roughly 20 meters before drawing their swords, and the charge began. At this range, the powerful muskets usually felled many enemy troops and was demoralising to them. Directly after the volley, the Swedes charged the enemy ranks with pikes, bayonets and sabres. Note that the pikes were used as an offensive weapon: in close combat, they had the advantage over their foes' weapons thanks to their range. After the bayonet was introduced in the Carolean army (1700‚Äì1706), the final volley was delayed until the soldiers were inside bayonet range. Every infantry battalion had grenadiers attached. They supported the infantry attack by lobbing grenades from the flanks. They also formed units of their own. They were otherwise equipped like infantry. Thus, in the latter half of the 17th century, the major difference between the Swedish army and those common on the continent was the relative lack of firepower and the use of pikes and sabres. Sweden and Russia were the only countries at the time using pikes. In contemporary Europe, infantry were equipped with a musket, while in the Swedish army, every third man had a pike. The pikemen were normally deployed four men deep with musketeers of equal depth on the sides. The pike was used to repulse cavalry and to break the enemy lines as they charged.

The holiday was adopted by the Tibetan legislature on 19 January 2009, and was promulgated that same year. In modern Tibetan history, 28 March 1959 was the day that the Tibetan government was declared illegal by China, which, according to the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese academics, liberated Tibetans from \\"feudalism\\" and \\"theocracy\\".  History  The holiday was announced to mark the 50th anniversary of the beginning of \\"democratic reform\\" of the Tibetan feudal theocratic social structure on 28 March 1959, where according to China, one million people were freed from serfdom. The People's Republic of China had been established since 1949, and has had control over Tibet since 1951. Mao Zedong had entered into negotiations with the 14th Dalai Lama to initiate land reform, but was told in 1957 that any reforms would have to be approved by the Tibetan nobility. Mao was surprised by the 1959 Tibetan uprising, which Chinese historians call an attempt by feudal lords to continue the system forever, but the Dalai Lama calls a \\"national uprising\\". In retrospect, the Dalai Lama also prefers the term \\"poor people\\" for Tibetans, for which he says the designation \\"serf\\" is questionable. He also alleges that the Government of Tibet had drawn up plans to gradually lower hereditary debts, but that the central government was hesitant, preferring to do things their own way.Laird, Thomas. The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama (2006) Grove Press. pp. 317‚Äì319 On 28 March, in what China Daily called the simultaneous \\"end of serfdom and the abolition of the hierarchic social system characterized by theocracy\\", Zhou Enlai issued a State Council Order declaring the \\"dissolution\\" of the government of Tibet. The order also directed the People's Liberation Army to suppress the uprising, confiscate the possessions of the rebels, and give them to the serfs, which by China's estimate, comprised 90% of the population in Tibet. Reportedly, serfs were burning their feudal contracts and dancing in the streets. Anna Louise Strong marks 17 July as the precise date when feudal debts were abolished by the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Warren W. Smith concurs, and further suggests that the government has chosen 28 March instead as \\"counter-propaganda\\" to the 2008 Tibetan unrest.  Bill  In presenting it to the Tibetan legislature, Pang Boyong, Deputy Secretary General of the Tibetan Regional Congress Standing Committee, said the bill is aimed at \\"reminding all the Chinese people, including Tibetans, of the landmark 'democratic reform' initiated 50 years ago; since then, millions of slaves under the feudal serfdom became masters of their own\\". On 19 January 2009, at the second annual session of the ninth regional People's Congress in 2009, 382 legislators voted unanimously for the bill, designating 28 March annually as Serfs' Emancipation Day.  Observance  Serfs' Emancipation Day was celebrated in Lhasa on 28 March 2009. The procession started at 10 a.m. at Potala Palace, and the then-Governor Qiangba Puncog presided over the event, wearing traditional Tibetan dress. Local Communist Party secretary Zhang Qingli was also in attendance. \\"Representatives of former serfs\\", students, and soldiers gave speeches in Tibetan and Mandarin. Tibetan students and herders gathered and waved Chinese national flags. About 13,280 people were in attendance.  Reaction  The office of the 14th Dalai Lama denounced the holiday, saying that China was trying to declare new holidays to \\"avoid the situation\\" in Tibet. Kent Ewing of the Asia Times called the holiday \\"a reminder of the feudal system that existed in Tibet before the Chinese invaded in 1950\\", but believes that the holiday will embitter Tibetans. Tsering Shakya echoes the Dalai Lama's condemnations, and also calls the celebrations \\"A choreographed spectacle\\" for \\"the delivery of public mass compliance to the leadership in Beijing\\" in response to \\"the widespread protests that engulfed the Tibetan plateau in March‚ÄìApril 2008\\" (see 2008 Tibetan unrest).

She participated in the activities of ecological camps, in social fora, including the Fifth European Social Forum in Malm√∂ 2008, organised the 'Anti-capitalism 2008' festival, demonstrated widely, and was involved in anti-fascist activities more generally. In July 2008, Baburova participated in a demonstration against the felling of the Khimki Forest. For her involvement in another protest against the eviction of former pork factory workers from the Moscow factory, 'Smena' and impoverished CIS immigrants she would spend a night in prison. The day before her murder, Anastasia appeared at the anarcho-communist unity event 'Autonomous Action'. Earlier she had written an article on behalf of the journal 'Avtonom'. Journalistic activity Throughout 2008, Anastasia Baburova worked on the editorial team of the Russian newspaper, Izvestia, and had had dozens of articles published by both Izvestia and Financial News, particularly on finance. In December 2008, she resigned from this post over the political course of the newspaper, which, according to the British weekly newspaper The Economist, may be characterised by \\"nationalism, spinelessness and cynicism\\".  Death and investigation  Baburova became the fourth Novaya Gazeta journalist to be killed since 2000. At first it was reported that Baburova had been wounded in an attempt to detain Markelov's killer, but later Russian law enforcement authorities declared that Baburova was shot in the back of her head. Baburova died a few hours after the attack at a Moscow hospital. Then President of Ukraine Viktor Yushchenko sent her parents a condolence telegram on 23 January 2009. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev gave his condolences 6 days later. On 26 January 2009, Baburova was buried in the central city cemetery of her home town of Sevastopol. In November 2009, Russian authorities declared the end of the criminal investigation. The murder suspects were 29-year-old Nikita Tikhonov and his girlfriend, 24-year-old Eugenia Khasis, members of a radical neo-Nazi nationalistic group. According to investigators, Tikhonov was the one who committed the murder, while Khasis reported to him, by cell phone, the movements of Markelov and Baburova right before the assault. The motive of the murder was revenge for Markelov's prior work as a lawyer in the interests of anti-Russian activists. The murder suspects were arrested, and were reported to have confessed. In May 2011, Tikhonov was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Khasis was sentenced to 18 years in prison. According to Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer, the details of the murder indicate involvement of Russian state security services.

Background Undressing Underwater was recorded at Oxide Studios in Southern California, Sunset Sound and Henson Studios. The album was self-produced by Anderson, along with David Kahne, Mudrock and Parthenon Huxley. The title of the album was picked by Anderson from a boyscout handbook of the early sixties that listed various things to do underwater, including getting undressed. The leading track \\"Hurt Myself\\" features most of the touring Paul McCartney band, with McCartney on bass and backing vocals, Abe Laboriel Jr. on drums, David Kahne on keyboards and production duties, and Wix Wickens adding additional keyboards. Anderson stated in an interview that the majority of the recordings \\"were done in between touring\\" with Paul McCartney.

Some reviewers praised Anderson for the number of big-ticket guest stars on the album, from McCartney to Parthenon Huxley. Anderson‚Äôs guitar playing ability, experimental views to rock music, and striving to create new combinations of music were mentioned among the positives of the album. However, reviewers noted that the album did not live up to the greatness that was expected, as stated by a reviewer: \\"The material itself seems somewhat limited... most of them don't seem to reverberate very far\\". Reviewer Meredith Williams stated that Rusty Anderson \\"provides the oh-so-common rock-pop appeal of a catchy chorus, with guitar solos echoing in the background ‚Äî but not always effectively\\".

Background With the well known RENFE Class 333 locomotives having served for over 30 years the Spanish rail operator faced decisions as to their future. Different options for action were available - rebuild/repair/upgrade the locomotives or replace them with new models; at the time the company was undergoing a major modernisation project - with about 6 billion Euros being invested in rolling stock as part of a 120 billion Euro transport plan. In the event, acting pragmatically, RENFE chose to do both. The 333 series were extensively rebuilt forming the 333.3 and 333.4 subclasses, and 28 new locomotives were ordered - these were the new build Class 334. A few components were used from old Class 333s,Comparativa entre las locomotoras series 334, 354, y 333-400 de Renfe Comparison between RENFE locomotives of series 334, 354 and 333.4 (spanish) so technically the Class could be considered a rebuild, but the amount of material reused was small so a new class was created. Technical details and manufacture RENFE worked with Alstom, who then owned the locomotive manufacturing plant in Valencia, to come up with a design for the new locomotives; Alstom Valencia already had produced diesel powered passenger locomotives for the UK and Israel as well as modernising the RENFE class 333. The design was similar to the modernised 333s but with a General Motors EMD 710 engine instead of the EMD 645 used in the Class 333.4. Additionally 2-axle trucks were used instead of the 3-axle type that were re-used from the original 333 class in the rebuilt 333.4 and 333.3 models. Curiously the twenty eight Class 334 locomotives inherit the main generator, alternator and heating equipment from RENFE Class 319.3 locomotives - which in turn have inherited the generators and alternators from scrapped Class 333 locomotives.Comienza la construcci√≥n de la nueva serie 334, similares a las 333 The construction of a new 334 series - similar to the Class 333 (spanish) In summary, the engine, electronics and power transmission system are from General Motors, the other components are typical of an Alstom locomotive. Despite a change of ownership in 2004, with the factory being bought by Vossloh, the production was not affected. Operation Talgo and 334 locomotive in Ourense railway station. The Class 334 locomotives were originally intended for operations between Madrid, Murcia and Cartagena. Six units are used to provide an Altaria service between Madrid and Murcia, the regional capital of the region of Murcia. They are also used on the daily Talgo service from Lorca (Murcia) to Montpellier (France) as far as Barcelona. Four further units provide a Talgo service between Madrid and Almer√≠a. Their use also means that it is not necessary to change engines at the Linares-Baeza station at Baeza.Renfe acorta desde ma√±ana minutos el tiempo de viaje entre la capital y Madrid RENFE cuts time by minutes for travek from the capital (of Almeria) and Madrid (spanish) RENFE shortens train times by 31minutes between Almeria and Madrid (spanish) Additionally since 5 units of the RENFE Class 354 are out of action (two destroyed in a head end collision in Linarejos, three others had accidents in Hell√≠n, Tobarra and Chinchilla and another caught fire) the Class 334 have been used to replace them (being the 354 and the 334 the only diesel locomotives capable of 200 km/h in Spain). However the lower power-to-weight ratio compared to the Class 354 units leads to the typical conclusion of lower technical performance for locomotive hauled trains. Three locomotives are used to replace the Class 354s destroyed at Linarejos (one used as a reserve) and will operate between A Coru√±a and Madrid. The replacement service began in March 2007 and ends when the construction of a true high speed line is completed.Las locomotoras que Renfe estrena hoy no servir√°n para el futuro AVE Locomotives RENFE introduces today will not be used for the future AVE, March 2007 (spanish) Servicing In 2006 a joint venture between RENFE and Vossloh, Erion, was created, dedicated to servicing and manufacture of rail equipment.

Cooper became one of the wealthiest and most powerful bootleggers in Canada.  Bootlegging  Ontario voted for prohibition of alcohol in October 1919. This law lay out that residents were allowed to purchase liquor for private use only. Saloons and bars were closed, and the only way to consume alcohol was in the privacy of the individual‚Äôs home. Because Cooper discovered there was nothing to prevent Ontario distilleries from completing any orders not originating in Ontario, he opened an office across the river in Detroit. By taking orders by phone from customers in Windsor, Cooper was allowed to produce and provide alcohol to his customers. He worked on a commission basis for Hiram Walker, and for a director for Dominion Distillery products. On average he managed to make one dollar per case for his work.  Farming innovation  Although much of Cooper‚Äôs fortune was made through bootlegging, he was also one of the leading innovators of farming in southern Ontario. In 1918, Cooper bought of farmland near Belle River. He initiated the widespread practice of deep ploughing and tilled the acreage so that spring crops could be ready approximately two weeks sooner. He installed a new style of field draining that used clay tiles. Tiling was an expensive and unknown method at the time. The successful experiment was quickly noticed by neighbouring farms and word spread rapidly through southern Ontario. Cooper constructed a tiling factory on his own farm, and was soon producing 10,000 tiles and 20,000 bricks per day. Cooper also built the Belle River Seed and Grain Company. James Scott Cooper built several structures, including a mansion in Walkerville that has since been torn down, and a two-story building in Belle River. Formally the Cooper Hotel, the Cooper Court was constructed in 1920 at a cost of $40,000. This local bar is still open for business. He was one of the few wealthy men in the late 1920s and 1930s to keep his wealth through the 1929 Stock Market Crash, as he did not invest in the stock market.  Disappearance and reported death  In 1931 Cooper booked passage aboard the S.S. Deutschland bound for Europe. On February 10, 1931, his wife Helen sent a telegram to Windsor, Ontario, indicating that he fell overboard and that the body had not been recovered. His body was never found, and there has been speculation that he may have faked his own death.  References   Further reading  *Gervais, C.H Marty.

The new line is part of Queensland Rail's City suburban network, branching from the North Coast line. It starts 200 metres north of Petrie railway station, extending from ( to north of Central railway station). The line has six stations: Kallangur, Murrumba Downs, Mango Hill, Mango Hill East (previously called Kinsellas Road), Rothwell and Kippa-Ring. Funding for the project consisted of $742 million from the Commonwealth Government, $300 million from the Queensland Government (plus another $120 million for land) and $105 million from the Moreton Bay Regional Council. The line was officially opened on 3 October 2016, about 130 years after it was first proposed. The first train to depart from Kippa-Ring was SMU 285 and 295, with the Prime Minister, Queensland Premier and the first train ballot winners on board. Early history A rail line to Redcliffe was first proposed in 1895 when the Queensland Government's Minister for Railways, the Hon. Robert Philp, considered three proposals, preferring a route via North Pine (Petrie). In more recent times, the route for a Redcliffe railway was identified in the 1970s, and the required land was purchased and preserved as a transport corridor by the state government in the 1980s. The issue of the proposed railway line seemed to be a recurrent theme during state elections, leading to scepticism the line would ever be constructed. Petrie to Kippa-Ring Public Transport Corridor Study In 1999, the newly elected state government commissioned an investigative study into the transport corridor between Petrie to Kippa-Ring, conducted by GHD Group. Key components under investigation included the mode of transport, the route and location of stations, future public transport usage, and the timing of construction. The study was conducted in two parts. The first was completed in June 2000. It aimed to meet the state government's obligations to identify or forgo rights to a transport corridor running through the North Lakes residential development. This first stage was to decide on the preferred mode of transport, the viability of public transport along the corridor, and the preferred alignment of the corridor. Four modes of transport were investigated: heavy rail, buses or a busway, light rail, and monorail. It was decided that heavy rail was the preferred mode of transport along the existing preserved corridor as it was the only option to give an acceptable level of economic efficiency. The study found that heavy rail had a benefit-cost ratio of 1.46, and would generate the highest levels of patronage due to its integration into the existing Citytrain network, requiring no change mode. The second part of the study was completed in October 2003. It looked at the route of the corridor between Petrie railway station and Kallangur railway station at Goodfellows Road. The original, preserved route was recommended. Kippa Ring Station On 17 December 2001, the Minister for Transport announced public transport improvements between Petrie and Kippa-Ring, planned as part of a staged development of a new rail line in the area, following the release of the recommendations of the draft report of the Petrie to Kippa-Ring Public Transport Corridor Study. The Minister also said that the government was investigating private sector involvement in the construction of the project. On 11 July 2003, the Minister said that the government had not made a commitment on the proposed line, and that it may not go ahead because interest from the private sector in the project was negligible. This was at a time when similar passenger rail public-private partnerships such as the Airtrain to the Brisbane Airport and Airport Link to Sydney Airport were faltering. In June 2004, Queensland Transport released the Petrie to Kippa-Ring Public Transport Corridor Study's Impact Assessment Study. It claimed that the Impact Assessment Study only looked at costs of the Petrie to Kippa-Ring corridor, and did not take into account commercial-in- confidence costs involved in operating the trains, integrating the services with the rest of the Citytrain network, higher maintenance costs, and the costs of increasing capacity between the Brisbane central business district and Petrie. Based on these higher costs, Queensland Transport deemed the construction of the railway by 2007 could not be justified. The report also said possible savings from a public-private partnership were small and would not provide value for money. Queensland Transport said that it would preserve the corridor until it was required. On 15 June 2004 the government announced $3 million for improving existing bus services along the corridor between Kippa-Ring (Redcliffe) and Petrie \\"in the short to medium term\\". However, it again announced the continuing preservation of the reserved corridor for future public transport use. Recent history Site of Kippa-Ring railway station prior to construction. Frustrated by a lack of action by the Government, the Redcliffe City Council (now Moreton Bay Regional Council) unanimously moved on 4 July 2005 to support a campaign to have the Petrie to Kippa-Ring railway built, and to write to the Minister for Transport to express concern over the decision to not proceed with its construction. In 2007, the Pine Rivers Shire Council (now a part of Moreton Bay Regional Council along with Redcliffe City Council) purchased the old Tulip Town shopping centre land at Kallangur for $6 million, with the potential for it to be used with the proposed Kippa-Ring railway line. The site is nearby, but not immediately adjacent to, the location of a Murrumba Downs railway station. On 11 August 2008, the then state member for Murrumba through whose electorate the proposed line runs, said that there were no plans to construct the railway in the foreseeable future. The South East Queensland Regional Plan 2009‚Äì2031, released in December 2008, identified the preserved corridor in its Transport Infrastructure Network Plan as a \\"quality rapid transit route\\". During the 2009 Queensland state election, the then opposition party promised to start the construction of the line in its first term if it was elected, with the first stage of the line from Petrie to Mango Hill commissioned in 2014, and completed to Kippa-Ring by 2016. However, the incumbent government was subsequently returned to power. During the 2010 federal election, then Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced that the Kippa-Ring railway line would be fast-tracked, with the project to be complete by 2016 at a cost of $1.15 billion. On 3 December 2010, the funding agreement for the project was formalised, after being announced the day before. The agreement was signed by the Prime Minister Julia Gillard, Queensland Premier Anna Bligh and Moreton Bay mayor Allan Sutherland. The Department of Transport and Main Roads held an industry briefing in Brisbane on 17 August 2012 to provide an update on the Moreton Bay Rail Link Project (MBRL). The Request for Proposal was advertised on 24 August 2012 with responses closing on 21 September 2012. The procurement process to select a single design-and-construct contractor utilised a modified Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) process. On 1 August 2013, Thiess Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Leighton Holdings (with designers Aurecon, AECOM and geotechnical subcontractor Golder Associates) was awarded the $650 million contract for the design and construction of the new rail line. Thiess was part of the Trackstar team building the Moreton Bay rail link. On 30 May 2016, The Queensland Government announced that the rail link had been delayed indefinitely from its original mid-late 2016 opening period, due to signalling system faults that had been detected at Petrie, where the new line met the existing rail system. Testing indicated that the signalling system in its current configuration was unable to handle all the simultaneous rail movements at the junction, and would cause train delays right across the entire QR City Network. On 31 August 2016, the Transport Minister Stirling Hinchliffe announced in Parliament that the Moreton Bay Rail Link would open on 4 October 2016, with an open day the day before. A shortage of drivers owing to the increased requirements created by the new line resulted in mass cancellations of services across the Brisbane rail network, with over 100 cancelled on 21 October. After an admission of fault, Queensland Rail CEO Helen Gluer resigned over the debacle, as did the chairman Michael Klug. In February 2017, a commission of inquiry found that passengers were faced with train cancellations until at least the end of 2018, because no new drivers out of 200 promised had yet been fully trained. The commission also reported that QR management had not told rail operator's board, Transport Minister Stirling Hinchliffe, or Treasurer Curtis Pitt about how bad the problem was. Hinchliffe resigned a minister, despite the inquiry not attributing any blame to him, finding that the difficulties were a result of structural and cultural problems within Queensland Rail. Since completion the infrastructure has been owned by the Department of Transport and Main Roads but will be transferred to Queensland Rail in 2019.

Plot Imperium is a space adventure in which the goal is to either dominate the entire galaxy or live to be 1,000 years of age. The player controls all elements, from political to military, endeavoring not only to spread the empire's influence but also to prevent other empires from influencing the player's territory. The player maintains invasion forces, the building of fleets, and ensuring subordinates remain loyal, and can have the computer control the empire's economics, defense, and diplomacy. Gameplay Imperium is icon- and window-driven. Icons allow the player to save and load games, establish alliances and embargoes, review wealth, deploy forces and fight, check maps, and gather news and reports. The players can set windows around the screen, which contain selection areas to either type in data or click a button to retrieve additional data. All icons and all but one window, with attendant information, are displayed in monochrome. Reception The game was reviewed in 1991 in Dragon #165 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. Computer Gaming World in 1991 criticized Imperiums production values as \\"not what would be expected in an American game\\", but praised the gameplay and the computer opponent. The magazine concluded that \\"due to its strategic complexity and depth of play, it is certain to give any strategic gamer plenty of hours of enjoyment\\". In a 1992 survey of science fiction games the magazine gave the title four of five stars, stating that the game \\"seemed to quickly disappear from the market. Yet its rich texture and gameplay deserve a second look\\". A 1994 survey of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave the game three-plus stars.

Alano Memorial Hospital, Inc., a non-stock, non profit organization, duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, is an accredited healthcare institution by the Department of Health and the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation. This institution caters to the healthcare service needs of the locality spanning the five (5) municipalities of the province namely: Lamitan, Maluso, Lantawan, Sumisip, and Tipo-Tipo, as well as the City of Isabela where it is located.  History  The Juan S. Alano Memorial Hospital, Inc. was established in 1953 by its founder, first Assemblyman of Zamboanga Province to the National Assembly of the Philippine Commonwealth (1936‚Äì1941), and Congressman of the same at the 1st Philippine Congress (1946‚Äì1949), Don Juan S. Alano after recognizing the fact that the province was in need of a healthcare institution which caters to the underprivileged people of the community. With donated land given by the Basilan Estate, Inc. another company owned by Cong. Alano, and with the assistance of Dr. Jaime O. Rivera, his son-in-law and proprietor of the Rivera Hospital at Proj. 4, Quezon City, construction and training of the Hospital and its medical staff started early in 1952. The institution was then named and established as the Basilan Hospital, aimed at providing affordable healthcare service to the community as a non-stock, non-profit and charitable institution. Among the earliest Medical Directors of Basilan Hospital was Dr. Jesus Licad, father of world-class pianist Cecile Licad. He was joined by what was dubbed as \\"St. Luke's Nurses\\" all of whom were locals and Zamboanga residents who worked and trained at St. Luke's Hospital in Quezon City. One of the pioneering \\"St. Luke's nurses\\", Mrs. Isnaira Alcantara, has since been retained by the hospital as an honorary consultant way beyond her retirement years. In 1959, with the efforts of the founder himself, the Basilan Hospital School of Midwifery was finally established, aimed at providing the educational needs of the cultural minority groups as well as to train personnel to render specialized services in the field of midwifery. After the demise of the founder in 1966, Basilan Hospital was named after its founder and since then was known as Juan S. Alano Memorial Hospital, Inc., from then on the institution continued to provide affordable healthcare services for the public. Currently the institution is duly accredited by the Department of Health as a Level 2 Category Hospital with an authorized bed capacity of fifty (50). It is also accredited with the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation as a Secondary category hospital with an authorized bed capacity of thirty (30). It is likewise a full-fledged member of Philippine Hospitals Association (PHA) and Private Hospitals Association of the Philippines (PHAP). The hospital‚Äôs total employee population is fifty-eight (56), composed of nine (9) Administrative Dept. Staff; eight (9) Nursing Dept. Staff; seven (5) Pharmacy, Radiology, and Medical Records Dept. Staff; fifteen (15) Midwives; eleven (11) Maintenance Dept. Staff; three (3) Dietary Dept. Staff; and five (4) Medical Dept. Staff. The Juan S. Alano Memorial Hospital, Inc. is currently active in various medical missions for the underprivileged and under served communities of the province together with the Juan S. Alano Memorial School, Inc. (formerly Basilan Hospital School of Midwifery) through the National Service Training Program (NSTP). These medical outreach programs are aimed at providing affordable healthcare service to the far-flung areas of the province. The institution is also conducting various medical programs one of which is the free consultation and affordable eye surgery, which is conducted twice a year. Due to its private, non-sectarian orientation, the Juan S. Alano Memorial Hospital, Inc. has likewise forged strong ties with Family Planning of the Philippines (FPOP) throughout the 70s and 80s, promoting population management advocacies to the local community. It is currently working out a program on Adolescent Reproductive Health (ARH)initiatives with the Consuelo Foundation, to further institutionalize private-sector led programs aimed at disseminating vital information on Adolescent Reproductive health issues, condom use and HIV/AIDS prevention Although a declared non-sectarian organization, the Juan S.

Members of the RRQ waved Quebec, Patriote and Irish flags. The RRQ also planned to distribute leaflets commemorating links between Irish Canadians and Quebecers, including the involvement of Irish immigrants in the Patriote movement of 1837 in Lower Canada, as Quebec was known at the time.St. Patrick's Day parade too English, says sovereignist group However, both the Mouvement Qu√©bec fran√ßais and the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society of Montreal, two larger Qu√©bec nationalist groups, distanced themselves from the RRQ's march. In January 2009, the RRQ campaigned against the combat reenactment of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. Montreal Gazette's Quebec affairs columnist Don Macpherson wrote that the RRQ used propaganda of the deed combined with threats of violence and that played a major role in the cancellation of the reenactment. A spokesperson for the group, retired Quebec filmmaker Pierre Falardeau stated that if the reenactment took place, \\"some people will get their asses kicked\\". The RRQ said that for visiting spectators the reenactment would offer \\"a trip they won't soon forget\\". Patrick Bourgeois, of the RRQ stated, \\"The re-enactment is off, that's great. This thing unleashed passions. But ultimately, the responsibility for all of this is the people who concocted this dim-witted plan. Sure, we were promoting civil disobedience. But so were they. The potential for violence was there.‚Äù On June 23, 2009, Lake of Stew, an anglophone music group playing at the L'Autre St. Jean concert for the St. Jean Baptiste festivities at Pelican Park in Rosemont, Quebec, was heckled by members of the RRQ, but the heckling was met mostly with disdain by those in the audience and the band played on to cheers. Guillaume Duchesneau, a member of the RRQ, stated, \\"I don't think there should be two anglophone bands here. It's the patriotic celebration of Quebec started by a Quebec patriot, Ludger Duvernay in 1834, and it's like an oppression seeing groups sing here in English.\\" He said he noted a virtual absence of any Quebec flags, and said he wondered if a federalist group was organizing the party. On September 13, 2009, events were held in Quebec to commemorate the anniversary of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. The RRQ attended the 24-hour reading marathon, called the Moulin √† paroles, presenting 140 texts from Quebec artists and historical figures. One reading was the FLQ Manifesto written by the paramilitary organization called the Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec (FLQ). Quebec Premier Jean Charest stated that the reading \\"trivializes the FLQ, terrorism and violence\\" (). On November 10, 2009, the RRQ blocked the entrance to the Black Watch military armory on Bleury Street in Montreal during a visit from Prince Charles.

It premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival. International distribution rights were purchased by Magnolia Pictures for a mid-six figure sum. The film opened in New York City on a limited released on July 10, 2009. Much of the dialogue for the film was improvised. Plot Two heterosexual male friends Ben (Duplass) and Andrew (Leonard) meet after having not seen each other for 10 years. During a party, they find themselves locked in a \\"mutual dare\\" situation engaging to make a gay pornographic film, including anal sex, as an \\"art project\\" between two straight guys and submit it to the HUMP! film festival. They do not decide yet who will penetrate whom. Ben tells Andrew that he will discuss the project with his wife Anna (Delmore). As Ben begins to describe the project to Anna, she reacts skeptically at the mere mention of amateur pornography. Ben finds himself lying to Anna; he talks about the project with only vague detail, telling her that he will likely act as a behind-the-scenes assistant to the hypothetical film crew. Later, Anna finds herself alone with Andrew and suggests that they have a drink together in an effort to get to know one another. Now drunk, the two begin discussing Ben and Andrew's art project, Andrew assuming that Ben has completely informed Anna of their intentions. After Andrew bluntly reveals that Ben will potentially have a gay experience, Anna becomes upset and confused, confronting Ben personally. The next morning, Ben insists that he still wants to go through with the project, and Anna consents. Ben and Andrew meet in a hotel, bringing a video camera. Their attempts to have sex are prolonged by lengthy discussions and frequent analyzing of how to approach the experience. Although they film themselves kissing each other on the mouth, and hugging each other in their underpants, neither Ben nor Andrew appears comfortable becoming completely naked, let alone having sex. The two continue to talk, not sure if either one will be able to achieve an erection, and begin to question the validity of their experiment as a work of art. Ben finally suggests that they call off the project, and the two laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation. Ben leaves the hotel, intending to apologize to Anna. Andrew prepares to leave shortly afterward, but not before reviewing the footage that the two have recorded.
