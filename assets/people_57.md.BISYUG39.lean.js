Rahman was a spokesperson for the Muslim community following the Christchurch mosque shootings. In media interviews following the attack, she voiced frustration at the failure of the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service to take concerns about violence towards the Muslim community, Islamophobia and the rise of the alt-right in New Zealand seriously. In response to the attacks, Rahman established the Inclusive Aotearoa Collective to combat discrimination. She made submissions and presentations to a parliamentary select committee on behalf of the Islamic Women's Council in support of gun law changes, saying that the tightening of those laws would prevent violence towards vulnerable communities.

It is one of 5 general autonomous units of the University of the West Indies system. Its main campus is located inside the University of the West Indies at Cave Hill, but remains a distinct and separate institution.  History  The Open Campus was established to improve services to the non-campus territories. It brought together several existing UWI units, namely the University of the West Indies Distance Education Centre (UWIDEC), the School of Continuing Studies (originally the Extra Mural Department), the Tertiary Level Institutions Unit, and the Office of the Board for Non-Campus Countries & Distance Education (BNNCDE). The Extra-Mural Department was first established in 1947 when UWI was still the University College of the West Indies. As it developed into the School of Continuing Studies, it eventually incorporated the Caribbean Child Development Centre, the Hugh Lawson Shearer Trade Union Education Institute, the Human Resources Development Unit, the Social Welfare Training Centre and the Women and Development Unit. The University of the West Indies Distance Teaching Experiment (UWIDITE) was an initiative funded by a USD 600,000 grant from USAID. The telecommunications system was first used in St. Lucia, Dominica, Antigua and Grenada to provide access to courses in non-campus territories. At the same time, there was a Challenge Examinations scheme that allowed students to undertake initial (first year) studies in their home territories before joining one of the three campuses. The UWIDITE facilities were used to support the Challenge program. In 1996, UWIDEC, incorporating the UWIDITE and the Challenge Examinations scheme, was established. Further development of the UWIDEC was implemented in 2003. In 2007, the Open Campus was approved. This Campus was provided with additional financial, human, technology and administrative resources and a structure that was intended to better serve non-campus territories. Aside from the main campus in Barbados, UWIOC maintains presence in 17 English-speaking countries and territories in the Caribbean: Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, and Turks and Caicos Islands.  Open Campus Country Sites  The Open Campus maintains physical sites in most contributing countries. The country sites conduct marketing and recruit new students, facilitate some face to face courses, provide spaces for studying, and some have UWI library branches. * Anguilla - one site * Antigua & Barbuda - one site * Bahamas - one site * Barbados - one site plus the Open Learning Centre at the Cave Hill Campus * Belize - one site * British Virgin Islands - one site * Cayman Islands - one site * Dominica - one site * Grenada - one site * Jamaica - 11 sites plus the Open Learning Centre at the Mona Campus * Montserrat - one site * Saint Lucia - one site * St. Kitts & Nevis - one site * St. Vincent & the Grenadines - one site * Turks and Caicos - one site * Trinidad & Tobago - 13 sites (sites, satellite centres, and IT Academy) plus the Open Learning Centre at the St. Augustine Campus Bermuda does not currently have a Country Site.  Academic Programmes  The Open Campus offers a wide range of programmes in both distance mode and face-to-face mode at one of its many regional learning centres. At the undergraduate level, the Open Campus offers programmes at the certificate, diploma, associate and bachelor levels in fields such as education, business and public administration, sports, technology, humanities and social sciences. Similarly, at the graduate level, the Open Campus offers programmes at the advanced certificate, postgraduate diploma, masters and doctoral levels in similar areas. The Campus includes courses and certificates that would be considered part of continuing and professional education, prior learning assessment, and summer school courses. While the Open Campus is the main distance education unit of the University, some other units offer programmes by distance. For example, the UWI/FIFA/CIES Diploma in Sports Management is offered by distance and managed by UWI Mona. Similarly, the Department of Library and Information Studies offers several masters-level programmes in a blended learning format. = Accreditation = In 2019, UWI Open Campus was re-accredited by the Barbados Accreditation Council for the maximum term, ending in 2026. Subsequently, as the Open Campus operates across countries and territories, sought mutual recognition in contributing countries/territories.  Research and Development  The Open Campus, as with the landed UWI campus, has an active research and development environment. The main research unit is the Consortium for Social Development & Research (CSDR). It units several units that were already established before the Open Campus amalgamated several existing units. The units with a significant research mandate (along with educational development) include: * Caribbean Child Development Centre (CCDC) * Hugh Shearer Labour Studies Institute (HSLSI) * Social Work Training and Research Centre (SWTRC) * The Women and Development Unit (WAND) Other units are more developmental in nature, in the sense of improving access to education and training: * Human Resources Development Unit (HRDU) * Radio Education Unit (REU) * a yet-to-be-formed Cultural Studies Unit (CSU)  See also  *University of the West Indies *open university *distance education References Category:Open universities Category:Education in Barbados Category:Educational organisations based in Barbados Category:Universities and colleges in Barbados Category:University of the West Indies Category:Universities and colleges in British Overseas Territories ","title":"University of the West Indies Open Campus"},{"id":"62604086","text":"The Turan Range () is a range of mountains in far North-eastern Russia.

History =The first decades (1907‚Äì1940)= Methodist ministry in Estonia commenced in the first decade of the 20th century. In 1907, George A. Simons, an American of German descent, was named the superintendent of Finland and Russia with a seat in Saint Petersburg by bishop William Burt in Z√ºrich. Estonia became part of Simmons' missionary area because it was part of the Russian Empire. The first missionary in Estonia was Vassili T√§ht, a colporteur of the British and Foreign Bible Society in Saint Petersburg. On 9 June 1907 Vassili met his friend Karl Kuum, a brother in the Moravian Church, on the island of Saaremaa. They started to proclaim the Gospel together. This date is considered the beginning of the activities of the Methodist Church in Estonia. The first Methodist service in Estonia was held in merchant Mihkel Trey's home in Kuressaare, Saaremaa.Eesti Metodisti Kirik 1907‚Äì2007 = United Methodist Church in Estonia 1907‚Äì2007 Eesti Metodisti Kirik, 2007, p. 10.

Retrieved 17 December 2019. On 28 October 1912 the first Methodist church building in Estonia was consecrated in Kuressaare. The evangelisation outside the town of Kuressaare was carried out by Martin Prikask. In July 1910 the first branch of the Kuressaare congregation was established in the village of Reek√ºla,Eesti Metodisti Kirik 1907‚Äì2007 = United Methodist Church in Estonia 1907‚Äì2007 Eesti Metodisti Kirik, 2007, pp. 57‚Äì58. the next one in September 1910 in the village of Rahniku.Eesti Metodisti Kirik 1907‚Äì2007 = United Methodist Church in Estonia 1907‚Äì2007 Eesti Metodisti Kirik, 2007, p. 61. From the island of Saaremaa the Methodist mission spread to the mainland where the first congregation was established by Karl Kuum in July 1912 in Tapa.Eesti Metodisti Kirik 1907‚Äì2007 = United Methodist Church in Estonia 1907‚Äì2007 Eesti Metodisti Kirik, 2007, p. 63. The wider spread of Methodism to various areas of Estonia began in 1918, approximately at the same time with Estonia gaining its independence. The first Methodist congregation in the capital, Tallinn, was established on 3 March 1922.Eesti Metodisti Kirik 1907‚Äì2007 = United Methodist Church in Estonia 1907‚Äì2007 Eesti Metodisti Kirik, 2007, p. 71. By 1 January 1940 the Methodist Church in Estonia constituted of 1,836 members in 14 congregations (Tallinn I and Tallinn II, Haapsalu, Tapa, Rakvere, Paide, Tartu, Viljandi, P√§rnu, Narva, Avanduse, Kuressaare, Targu, and Paide). From 1920 to 1940 Methodists published a monthly magazine Kristlik Kaitsja and had their own publishing house of the same name. From 1935 to 1940 a second magazine, Koduteel, was published by congregations on the island of Saaremaa. Clergy was educated abroad, mostly in Germany. The church sent out its own missionaries among whom the most notable was Johannes Karlson, a missionary in South America. As Methodism had spread in Estonia as part of the Russian mission of the Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC), the local congregations continued to be affiliated with this oldest and largest Methodist denomination in the United States. They remained for over a decade part of the Russian missionary district of the MEC. The first attempt to form a separate church district for Estonia took place in 1921 when the first annual Methodist conference in Estonia took place and Martin Prikask was appointed the first local superintendent, however, the position was abolished a year later. The district was restored in 1928 with Prikask becoming again superintendent.Eesti Metodisti Kirik 1907‚Äì2007 = United Methodist Church in Estonia 1907‚Äì2007 Eesti Metodisti Kirik, 2007, p. 38‚Äì39. After the changes in the Estonian law of religion the local Methodist organisation was registered in 1935 as an independent church under the name of Methodist Episcopal Church in Estonia (). The Methodist Church was given similar privileges to the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church and the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church. As according to the new law all churches had to be governed locally, superintendent Prikask was elected an acting bishop but was never consecrated as one, so the spiritual episcopal authority continued to be exercised by bishop Raymond J. Wade in Stockholm, Sweden. =Under occupations (1940‚Äì1991)= A few months before the Soviet occupation, on 25 February 1940 the General Meeting of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Estonia adopted new statutes and a new name, Estonian Methodist Church ().Eesti Metodisti Kirik 1907‚Äì2007 = United Methodist Church in Estonia 1907‚Äì2007 Eesti Metodisti Kirik, 2007, p. 24‚Äì25. In the first year of the Soviet occupation (1940‚Äì1941) several church members were repressed. Four Methodist pastors, including superintendent Martin Prikask, were arrested, deported and later executed. After a relative easing of restrictions on religious organisations during the German occupation (1941‚Äì1944) the religious life in Estonia became again subject to Soviet persecutions of religion. In the Stalinist era there were unsuccessful attempts to liquidate the Estonian Methodist Church and make the members to join the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church.Eesti Metodisti Kirik 1907‚Äì2007 = United Methodist Church in Estonia 1907‚Äì2007 Eesti Metodisti Kirik, 2007, p. 42. Many congregations lost their buildings ‚Äì in Tallinn one of the Methodist churches had been destroyed in a Soviet air raid in 1944 and the second church was taken over by the Soviet Army in 1950. The Methodist congregation in Tallinn had to move to a little church of the Seventh-day Adventists they continued to share until 2000. Some members of the Methodist clergy were further repressed, e.g. pastor of the Tallinn congregation Aleksander Kuum was arrested and deported in 1952.Eesti Metodisti Kirik 1907‚Äì2007 = United Methodist Church in Estonia 1907‚Äì2007 Eesti Metodisti Kirik, 2007, p. 45. Religious life in Estonia started to normalise after Joseph Stalin's death in 1953. In 1960s contacts with Methodist organisations abroad became possible again. In 1961 the first episcopal visit after WWII took place when Norwegian bishop Odd Arthur Hagen visited Tallinn. In 1968 when the United Methodist Church was founded, superintendent Aleksander Kuum from Estonia was able to take part in the founding conference in Dallas. Since that time the Methodist Church in Estonia has been part of the Northern Europe Central Conference of the United Methodist Church. In 1971 Aleksander Kuum became also a member of the World Methodist Council Executive Committee.Eesti Metodisti Kirik 1907‚Äì2007 = United Methodist Church in Estonia 1907‚Äì2007 Eesti Metodisti Kirik, 2007, p. 26‚Äì27.

The first class began with 54 students in August 1994. The seminary is now accredited as an institution of higher education in Estonia offering both one-year diploma certificate and a three-year degree programme in theology.

The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in occupied Europe against the Axis powers, especially Nazi Germany. SOE agents allied themselves with resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England. Lavigne parachuted into the Sa√¥ne-et-Loire Department of France near Taiz√© on May 23, 1944 and worked as a wireless operator and a courier for the Silversmith network (or circuit). She died of an embolism. Early life Lavigne worked mostly in Marne Department for the Silversmith network. Born Madeleine Rejeuny, the daughter of a fabric designer, she married Marcel Lavigne when she was 19 years old and had two children, Guy and Noel. Her husband became a prisoner of war early in World War II and after he was released by the Germans in 1943 they divorced. Her appearance was described by her SOE colleague, Robert Boiteux, as \\"unexceptional.\\" She had \\"untapped intelligence\\" and was noted for \\"careful following of instructions.\\"O'Connor, Bernard (2018), SOE Heroines, Gloucestershire: Amberly Publishing, p. 310 She spoke little or no English.Escott, Beryl E.

She allowed SOE agent Henri Borosh to keep his wireless set in her house.Escott, p. 199 SOE network Silversmith Lavigne began traveling as a courier for the SOE in 1943. In January 1944 Borosh and Lavigne realized that the French police were attempting to arrest them, and requested evacuation. Along with several other compromised SOE agents they were evacuated by a British military aircraft air from a field near Angers to England on February 4. After her departure, Lavigne was tried and convicted in absentia in Lyon as a terrorist and sentenced to life imprisonment.Escott, p. 200 In England, Lavigne received para-military, parachute, and wireless training. Her training, however, was cut short due to a shortage of SOE agents in France. She returned to France as a half-trained wireless operator. She parachuted into France on May 23-24, 1944 and moved north to Reims to establish the Silversmith network there. She rented a house in √âpernay to serve as a base. Her colleague Henri Borosh joined her as head of Silversmith. For the next several months she worked as a courier delivering messages and arranging with SOE in London for air drops of weapons and supplies to the French resistance. \\"The Germans were everywhere and [she] often had to pass through areas under fire, showing great courage and common sense.\\"O'Connor, pp. 311-313 Lavigne had to hide from the Germans in a safehouse when the Silversmith network was compromised. The American army liberated Reims on August 29, 1944. She finished her mission with SOE in September. Her two sons had lived with her parents while she worked for SOE and she reunited with them in Paris.

Description Vermifilter toilets contain composting worms that digest faeces, thus reducing the accumulation rate, and significantly extending the frequency intervals for the removal of the solid waste. A worm colony can live inside the toilet indefinitely as long as the correct environmental conditions are maintained. In long-term refugee camps, this reduces the need to replace filled pit latrines, and is a more cost-effective solution. Flushing water is required to dilute the ammonia produced from urine, a ventilated aerobic environment must be provided, and the flush water must be able to drain away. Every 8 to 10 years, maintenance on the toilet must be performed, which consists of removing the accumulated worm castings. The worm castings are suitable as a soil conditioner, and may be used as fertilizer. A typical pit latrine may need to be completely emptied or rebuilt after 2-3 years and often comes with smell and contamination issues. A primary vermifilter provides primary treatment of the liquid effluent generated by humans and worms and decomposes the solids into humus. The filtered waste is not a safe or sanitized material and is normally disposed of in an underground soakage trench or \\"soakaway\\".  Examples  * Bear Valley Ventures has used the brand \\"Tiger Toilet\\" for marketing their product. * Biofilcom, and GSAP Microflush toilet secured funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop vermifilter toilet technology in Africa. * Oxfam also instructs construction of brandless vermifilter toilets.  History  Anna Edley constructed a vermicomposting flush toilet in 1995, called the Solviva Biocarbon filter system. Colin Bell from New Zealand began marketing his \\"wormorator\\" in the early 2000s, which was a twin-chamber vermifilter toilet. Colin provided information on the construction of his \\"wormorator\\" to Claire Furlong of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who had secured grant money from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop and field test the technology.

He subsequently stayed in Paris in 1827‚Äì30, where he attended courses at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts under the supervision of Achille Lecl√®re. Upon his return to Switzerland, he started a political career and was a Radical Democratic deputy in the Grand Council of Vaud which he chaired six times between 1846 and 1861. He was a member of the city council of Lausanne from 1842 to 1843 and from 1848 to 1854. Moreover, Wenger sat in the Council of States from 1848 to 1849, then in the National Council from 1851 to 1854 and again in the Council of States from 1855 until his death in 1861. He became a colonel of the Swiss Army. As an architect, Wenger restored several important monuments such as the Chapel of St. Anthony, La Sarraz, the Reformed Church of Our Lady, Orny, and the rose of the Cathedral of Lausanne. However, Wenger was mainly a building architect. He designed churches in Le Brassus and Chavannes-le-Veyron. He may have built the church of Bussigny, but archive sources rather attribute this work to surveyor Samuel Cupelin and architect David Braillard. Wenger also designed buildings for the Army and justice such as the first barracks of Bi√®re and the women's prison in Lausanne. His works on healthcare buildings include the Asile des aveugles (Asylum for the blind) and the uncompleted project of a psychiatric hospital. Moreover, Wenger designed schools in Assens, Renens, Pompaples and Saint-Saphorin. His public buildings include the Arlaud Museum in Lausanne, the clock towers of Aubonne and Lutry, the bell tower of the temple of Prangins, the city hall and communal inn of Cully, the former customs station of Lausanne and the communal inn of Gimel.

In aiming to review books of all sorts, The Reader resembled in its approach the models Monthly Review and Critical Review of the 18th century.John F. Byrne, \\"The Reader\\": A Review of Literature, Science and the Arts, 1863-67, Victorian Periodicals Newsletter No. 4, [Vol. 2, No. 1] (Apr., 1969), pp. 47‚Äì50, at p. 48. Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press on behalf of the Research Society for Victorian Periodicals They were followed by J. Dennis, and Thomas Bendyshe. The editors of the science section were Thomas Henry Huxley and John Tyndall. Lockyer initially had had that job. With Herbert Spencer, he tried to turn around The Reader in 1864 by expanding its science content. But the December 1864 editorial \\"Science and Church Policy\\" by Huxley damaged circulation, by offending Christian Socialists.Ruth Barton, \\"Huxley, Lubbock, and Half a Dozen Others\\": Professionals and Gentlemen in the Formation of the X Club, 1851-1864, Isis Vol. 89, No. 3 (Sep., 1998), pp. 410‚Äì444, at pp. 439‚Äì40. Published by: The University of Chicago Press on behalf of The History of Science Society. There came to be flexibility of roles, with Frederick Pollock (1815‚Äì1888) taking on some responsibility in mid-1865. Contributors In April 1863 a list of 51 contributors was published. *George Edward Roberts *Alfred Russel Wallace contributed eight papers *John Richard de Capel Wise Legacy While the scientific content of The Reader ended with Bendyshe's ownership, the scientific group supplying it was the milieu for the founding of Nature in 1869. As far as Bendyshe's interests in human diversity went, James Hunt set up as successor the Popular Magazine of Anthropology in early 1866.

The remains of the Iron Age fort or dun lie on the old Auchans Estate in the Dundonald Woods near the site of the old Hallyards Farm and the quarry of that name. The footpath route known as the Smugglers' Trail through the Clavin Hills from Troon to Dundonald runs passed the ruins of the dun. Kemps Law is in the order of two thousand years old. History The place-name 'Kemp' is found elsewhere in the south of Scotland, such as at 'Kemp's Castle' on the Lugar Water near Auchinleck Castle and at Kemps Castle near Sanquhar in Dumfries and Galloway.Kemp's Castle Vitrified Fort, Euchan Glen, Sanquhar A Vision of Britain Through Time The antiquarian John Smith in 1895 visited Kemp Law and gives the place-name as meaning as 'battle hill' or 'warrior's grave'. He quotes a local as telling him \\"That's whaur th' brunt th' folk lang sine\\" and he speculates that after the dun was abandoned as a fortification it was used for cremations and over the centuries this would have resulted in the observed vitrification.Smith, page 120 He dismisses the suggestion that the site was used as some sort of beacon due to its low lying position.Smith, p.119 A number of other ancient fortifications are present in the area such as those at Hillhouse,Love, p.226 Wardlaw Hill Fort Hillfort (NS35923276), Dun Donald Hillfort (NS36363451) and Harpercroft Hillfort Hillfort (NS36003252). The scant remains of the chapel of St Mary and its associated holy well were still visible circa 1879 when Archibald Adamson visited Hallyards Farm. The chapel is thought to have been associated with Dundonald Castle.Adamson, p.58 =Structure= A drawing by John Smith of Kemp Law Dun in 1895. The dun lies in a well defended position on a minor ridge, but the site has been much disturbed and robbed of stone for building drystone dykes, etc. At Smith's time in the 1890s some stones were to be seen lying around and some of these were vitrified. On the northern side of the enclosure Smith identified a mound of stones, some eight feet in height. The walls of the dun were in a ruinous state and it was clear that no lime mortar had been used in its construction. Thorbjorn Campbell refers to the mound as being formed from 'rubbish' and identifies an enclosing wall that runs round the edge of the promontory.Campbell, p. 197 The stone walls are thought to have had timber interlacing and it is suggested that the deliberate burning of this timber resulted in the process of vitrification that supposedly strengthened the walls. James Paterson recorded the presence of a fosse or ditch on the west facing side which was not well protected by a steep declavity like the others sides. The fort was circular with a hollow passage covered with sandstone flags through which a person could crawl on hands and knees. This passage ran right round the structure. A find was made here of an ear-ring like piece of iron, four inches in length. This artifact was exhibited at the Ayr Mechanics' Museum, still attached to a piece of vitrified stone.Patterson, p.435 By 1863 the fort had been robbed and was just a mound of rubble covered with vegetation. In 1891 Christison recorded the remains of a possible entrance on the east facing side of the fort.Christison, p.391 Dane Love records that the dun was 36 feet across internally and the internal walls were circa 14 feet thick. Circa ten feet from these internal walls are the remains of a second defensive wall. The mound may have formed as a result of stone robbing.Canmore Kemp Law Dun In one area the wall was found to be vitrified on the external face for half its thickness. A shale pin head was found here in 1963, similar to one found at Traprain Law. =Vitrification= It is not clearly understood why or even how the stone walls were vitrified. Extreme heating has been shown to weaken the structure and an act of destruction seems unlikeley given that the walls to be vitrified would need carefully maintained fires for a lengthy period. Deliberate destruction following capture of the site or some form of ritual destruction by the ruling chief as an act of closure at the end of its useful life are other possibilities. =Etymology= The name \\"Kemp\\" is derived from Middle English kempe and from Old English cempa, meaning \\"warrior, knight, fighter or champion\\".Wiktionary. The Free Dictionary A kemp in Scots is a hero or a champion of great strength, and \\"Kemp\\" is a name applied to many hillforts, mottes, etc. throughout Scotland. The word dun denotes a kind of hillfort. The term originates in Scottish Gaelic as d√πn. This style of fort is linked to the Celts from around the 7th century BC. The ramparts of duns were typically made of stone and timber with two walls, an inner and an outer. Vitrified duns are the remains that have been set on fire, resulting in some of the stones' melting and binding together. The word law is derived from the Old English word hlƒÅw, meaning \\"hill\\".

A 1.97-metre tall who can play as a ruckman or key forward, McLean began his career in the TAC Cup before a season in the Victorian Football League (VFL). He was recruited by Sydney on the eve of the 2019 season as a pre-season supplemental selection, and made his AFL debut later that year.  Junior career  McLean attended St. Bede‚Äôs College in Mentone. He played junior football for the Beaumaris Sharks before joining the Sandringham Dragons in the TAC Cup. He also was a member of the AFL Academy ‚Äì spending time at the Sydney Swans as part of the development program ‚Äì and represented Vic Metro at the AFL Under 18 Championships. In 2017, McLean became Sandringham's captain and Vic Metro's vice-captain, but was overlooked in the 2017 AFL draft. He began playing in the VFL for the Sandringham Zebras, who were affiliated with AFL club St Kilda. McLean played 13 matches in 2018, averaging 5.2 marks, 10.3 hit-outs and 13.2 disposals and rucking against AFL-listed players including Matthew Leuenberger, Braydon Preuss and Zac Smith. He was also named the club's best first-year player for 2018. McLean trained with St Kilda in November, hoping to be selected in the 2018 AFL draft, and was named by Fox Sports, which considered him similar to Adelaide ruck/forward Josh Jenkins, as a likely mature-age recruit. However, he was again overlooked and moved to Adelaide to play with South Australian National Football League (SANFL) club South Adelaide in 2019.  AFL career  McLean was recruited by Sydney in March 2019 as a pre-season supplemental selection to cover the loss of defender Jack Maibaum to a season-ending anterior cruciate ligament injury. His recruitment also increased the club's depth of tall players after Kurt Tippett's retirement. McLean's selection was criticised by SANFL officials, as it deprived South Adelaide of an important recruit only a fortnight before their 2019 season began, leaving them unable to find a replacement in time. McLean spent most of his first season in Sydney's North East Australian Football League (NEAFL) side, before a call-up to the AFL team in round 18 ‚Äì a challenging match-up rucking alongside Robbie Fox against veteran Aaron Sandilands. He played three more matches to finish the season and extended his contract with Sydney to 2020.

It is a performing arts center which features concerts, comedy, theatre, and dance. Formerly the Sunset School, the site was purchased by the city of Carmel in 1965 with the plan to develop it into a cultural center. It is home to the Carmel Bach Festival. History The Sunset School was a public school founded in 1904 in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, moving in 1906 to San Carlos Street. The school was built in a late Gothic revival style by architect John J. Donovan. In 1931, a 733-seat auditorium was built for the growing school. This auditorium was sometimes utilized by outside organizations and producers, such as the Carmel Bach Festival. In 1964, faced with the need for expensive earthquake preparedness improvements and limited space to expand, the Sunset School District opted to sell the school to the City of Carmel for $550,000 USD. The city intended to turn the school into a performing arts center and the transaction was completed in 1965 through the passage of a bond measure. The site was renamed the Sunset Center. The theatre was renovated from September 2001 to July 2002 using money from a public‚Äìprivate partnership; the City of Carmel paid $9 million USD while private donors contributed $13 million USD. In 2003, a LARES sound system was installed. Previously, the auditorium had been known to absorb much of its sound, making it difficult for performers to hear. After performing in a one-man show at the theatre, Christopher Plummer famously wrote, \\"For God's sake, get yourself a real theater.\\" The LARES system, which cost around $300,000 USD, enhanced the volume of the performers, though many of the classical music groups using the venue were dissatisfied with it. In October 2002, the city of Carmel set up a non-profit organization to run the center. Tom Bacchetti was appointed as its interim director. Current executive director Christine Sandin took that role in 2011. In addition to the theatre, the complex includes a photography gallery, pottery and dance studios, and workshops for the arts. Currently, the Sunset Center is the home of the Carmel Adult School Pottery Studio, the Center for Photographic Art, the Forest Theater Guild, and the Yoga Center of Carmel. Current producing partners of the center are the Monterey Symphony, the Carmel Music Society, Chamber Music Monterey Bay, and the Carmel Bach Festival. Since 2017, the Sunset Center has also been contracted by the city to manage the nearby Forest Theater venue. Notable recordings Recordings of concerts at the Sunset Center have been made commercially available, dating back to when it was still a school.

He was known for his pioneering work in radio comedy, and his early commercial recordings in the genre. He took his own life after the death of his romantic and stage partner Gladys Horridge coincided with the imminent exposure of his deceptions about their marital status.  Career  Clapham as John Henry, with 'Erbert, from the 21 December 1923 edition of The Radio Times Clapham worked as comedian, entertaining Canadian troops during World War I. He subsequently found work as a clerk with the civil service, working at the Board of Trade. He was engaged to entertain a smoking concert arranged by his employer, and was \\"discovered\\" there by the BBC. Although many records of his early radio broadcasts are lost, it is known that his BBC debut was on 31 May 1923. He performed in the guise of John Henry, a \\"lugubrious Yorkshireman\\", who was hen-pecked by his wife, Blossom \\\\- a role latterly played by Gladys Horridge. Other characters referred to in his monologues and sketches were Henry's dog 'Erbert (an \\"almost collie\\") and Henry's friends Joe and Emma Murgatroyd. Between 1925 and 1932, a number of commercial gramophone recordings of his sketches were released on the His Master's Voice label. Some of these also featured Horridge. Clapham and Horridge had toured Australia and New Zealand. Henry also appeared as the subject of a comic strip in the Daily Sketch, and Clapham wrote in character for The Radio Times and Tit-Bits.  Personal life  Clapham married, and had at least one child, a son. He and his wife separated in or around 1914, but did not divorce. After another failed relationship, he became romantically involved with Gladys Horridge, and they lived together as man and wife, in a flat in Holland Road, Kensington, London  Horridge's death  Horridge died in April 1934, due to acute peritonitis. Clapham gave evidence at her inquest, falslely testifying that they were married. His manager, Sydney Brandon, said that Clapham subsequently drank heavily, and had said that he would not \\"get over\\" her loss. He also mentioned killing himself to Hazel Wilford (also known as Mrs. Hudson), an actress with whom he had begun to work. They had made their debut as \\"John Henry and the New Blossom\\" in late April. The pair were also planning film work, and a West End show. He left a sealed envelope with her, to be opened \\"when I'm not here\\".  Clapham's death  On 14 May, Clapham's upstairs neighbour at Holland Road noticed the smell of gas coming from Clapham's flat, and entered to find his body leaning against his gas stove, with a suicide note and letters lying adjacent. He was holding a photograph of Horridge. In one of the letters he left with Hazel Wilford, he had written: An inquest, held by the coroner for Paddington, Ingleby Oddie on 16 May, gave a verdict of death from coal gas poisoning, and that Clapham \\"killed himself while of unsound mind\\". During the inquest, it emerged that Clapham had feared that the exposure of and prosecution for his pretence of being married to Horridge would harm his career, and that he was being pursued by his estranged wife for alimony. Around 500 mourners attended his funeral, at Streatham Park Cemetery, which was paid for by the Variety Artistes' Benevolent Fund.  Legacy  Se√°n Street, Professor of Radio at Bournemouth University, described Clapham as the \\"forerunner of a number of great radio comedians, among them Tommy Handley, Gillie Potter, Arthur Askey, Frankie Howerd and Tony Hancock\\". Jennifer Purcell of Saint Michael's College called him \\"the first artist to write and perform radiogenic material.\\" She noted his experimental use of sound effects, and called his style as \\"warm and conversational, with a sense of casual armchair intimacy, well-suited to the domestic space of radio listening\\". However, she also critiqued how he \\"delineated the collective identity of his audience with remarks aimed at married men and fathers\\", giving as an example his comparison of wives to loudspeakers.

Following this time, the hospital where she received her initial training in Yorktown (Yorkton), Canada invited her as a matron. Myles proceeded to continue her education at McGill University, later getting appointed a senior tutor at the Postgraduate Hospital in Philadelphia and the director of midwifery education of the Women's Hospital, Detroit. In 1935, upon hearing of news of a new maternity hospital in Edinburgh, she returned to the United Kingdom. Having received a midwifery teacher's diploma in London 1939, she became a midwifery tutor to the new Simson Memorial Maternity Pavilion in the Scottish capital, where she practised until her retirement in 1954.  Writing career  During her career, Myles contributed as an author to various academic journals in Britain, Canada and the United States. She also wrote a book on how to care for babies, intended for school children. = Textbook for Midwives = Myles most seminal piece of writing has been her Textbook for Midwives, firstly published by Churchill Livingston in 1953. Although the book was published one year before her retirement, having had recognised a gap in midwifery education, Myles had started working on it since her tutor years.The book has been identified as Book of the Year as part of the seventy-fifth anniversary celebrations of the American Journal of Nursing.Myles Textbook for Midwives has been translated in many languages and is currently sold around the world, with its seventeen edition to be published in 2020. Out of these editions, Myles herself worked on ten revisions, updating the content with the latest best practices and developments and removing obsolete knowledge and practice. = Later career and death = Following her retirement from practice, Myles continued to visit and lecture at midwifery schools and obstetric units around the world, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Africa, Australia and New Zealand.Although having turned down many awards for honours and honorary appointments in her career, in 1978, she received an Honorary Fellowship of the Edinburgh Obstetrical Society.She passed away at Banchory, Kincardineshire in 1988, leaving a large legacy of midwifery experience and education behind her.

Her work includes photographs featuring the Orkney, Shetland, and Faroe Islands. Biography Gunnie Moberg was born on the 8th of May 1941 in Gothenburg, Sweden. Her father √Öke Moberg was an accountant, and her mother Margot Lundblad was an amateur painter. Gunnie left school at the age of 16 in order to pursue artistic photography. She began by working at a photographer's studio in Gothenburg but moved to Edinburgh, Scotland a year later. In Edinburgh she worked as an au pair and studied pottery at the Edinburgh College of Art, where she met Californian artist Tam MacPhail. They married in January 1961 and had four sons. They initially settled in Argyll, but later moved to Orkney in 1976, after Gunnie Moberg's visit in 1975. Her husband ran a bookshop in Stromness called 'Stromness Books & Prints', which published her first photography book in 1979. Between 1977 and 1979, the St Magnus Festival and the Pier Arts Centre were established. The St Magnus Festival appointed her photographer in residence; a role that she held for nearly thirty years. Her popularity as a photographer grew over time, but in later years she turned to painting. She died at the age of 66 in Stromness.  Artistic Work  Morberg's first publication was Stone Built in 1979. In this book, the photographer collected 18 aerial pictures she took across Orkney. She subsequently published a number of photography books. Her main subjects were the landscapes of the North Atlantic. In 1986 Moberg started a collaboration with the poet George Mackay Brown. Together, they published five books in which Moberg's photographs interweaved with George Mackay Brown's poetry. She also collaborated with the Norwegian author Liv Kj√∏rsvik Schei. This collaboration gave birth to The Orkney Story (1985) and The Shetland Story (1988).  Publications  * 1979: Stone Built. Stormness Books & Prints * 1985: The Orkney Story.

Her husband, William Murray, 2nd Lord Nairne, was condemned to death for his role in plans for a Scottish rebellion supported by neighbouring France; Lady Margaret travelled from Edinburgh to London to agitate in person for her husband's reprieve from execution, which was eventually successful.  Family  Margaret was born in Edinburgh in 1669, the only child of Margaret Graham and Robert Nairne, Lord Strathord and 1st Lord Nairne. After her father's death in 1683 Margaret became Baroness Nairne in her own right for seven years. As was typical among aristocratic families of the time Margaret's engagement was arranged (or 'contracted'). Her first engagement was to Lord George Murray but this contract was nullified due to Lord George's ongoing poor health, and in 1690 Margaret married his brother William (b. 1664) instead. Because Margaret was sole heir to her family's title, upon their marriage her husband became the 2nd Lord Nairne and was elevated to the rank of earl. Margaret bore twelve children including John, later 3rd Lord Nairne. All but one of the children were staunch Jacobites; son Robert was killed at the Battle of Culloden (16 April 1746) and daughter Margaret imprisoned the same year for her active support of the rebellion.  Jacobite activity  The Jacobite rising sought to restore the exiled House of Stuart to the throne in England, Scotland and Ireland and the Nairnes were active participants in the rebellion. Margaret's husband and their eldest son, John, were captured at the Battle of Preston in November 1715 and taken to London on a charge of High Treason to await their fate; Lord Nairne was sent to the Tower of London and John to Newgate prison while Margaret immediately journeyed south to see them. A reprieve was finally granted by George I and Lord Nairne was released in August 1717. The difficulties and dangers of the rising did not appear to dampen Margaret's commitment to the Jacobite cause, and upon Bonnie Prince Charlie's return to Scotland in 1745 she entertained him at Nairne House.  Letters  Correspondence written by Margaret and her husband to family and friends over the course of the first half of the eighteen century document both their personal and political concerns, including ¬£5,000 of domestic repairs after a fire at the family home which had 'a window for every day of the year'. One series of letters written by Lady Margaret documents her journey to London to seek a royal audience in order to plead for her husband's release from the Tower where she lived with him for a time in 1716.

He was President of the Maltese Language Society (Ghaqda tal-Malti) at the University of Malta. He is most noteworthy for his contributions to the Maltese language, and the translation of the Bible from the original Hebrew to Maltese.  Early years  Saydon was born on 24 July 1895, in ≈ªurrieq. He went to the local primary school, before enrolling in the national Seminary. In 1912 he took a preparatory course in Literature at the University of Malta, and qualified with B.Litt. at the age of 20. in 1919, he qualified with a degree in Canonical Law, and a subsequent Doctorate in Theology. Having come top of class, he was granted a Governmental scholarship to be able to continue his studies abroad. In 1919 he was also ordained as a priest, and the following year left for the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome, where he obtained a Licence in Holy Scriptures in 1923.  Bible translation  Saydon began his translation of the Bible from Hebrew to Maltese in 1929. This was notable for the fact that he did this entirely on his own, where other translations were typically completed in teams. It took him 30 years to complete, publishing the first version in 1959. This cost Saydon more than just his time - he financed his endeavours himself. Saydon was appointed Professor of Holy Scripture at the University of Malta, and contributed actively to a number of international conferences and congresses. This introduced him to numerous biblical scholars worldwide, and exposed him to the tenets of Catholicism, Protestantism and Judaism. Between the years of 1932 and 1962 he attended no less than 17 different conferences across Europe. He was the founder of the Maltese Biblical Society, and awarded membership of the International Association of the Study of the Old Testament. He was also a member of the Society of Biblical Literature in the United States of America. He also provided commentaries for six books of the Old Testament in a Commentary published under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church in England. This Catholic Commentary on Holy Scripture was published in London and Edinburgh in 1953.\\"Baruch\\" by P. P. Saydon, revised by T. Hanlon, in A New Catholic Commentary on Holy Scripture, ed. Reginald C. Fuller, Thomas Nelson, Inc. Publishers, 1953, 1975, ¬ß504j.  Setbacks  Although Saydon was considered the only qualified person for professorship of Holy Scripture in the University, in 1924 then Rector appointed Father Ugo Callus, a philosopher, to the post. This was a great disappointment for Saydon, but he was vindicated 7 years later when Callus left for Oxford in 1931. The vacant position was filled by Saydon, and thus at the age of 31 he was appointed Professor of Holy Scripture (in both Hebrew and Biblical Greek). He retained this position until his retirement in 1964. Saydon was also pipped to the post for a Lectoral Minitry in the Cathedral Chapter by Monsignor Nerik Dandria, who despite his inexperience in scripture studies, had strong political backing. The Maltese Ecclesiastical authorities failed to recognise Saydon's merits, despite being given the title of monsignor in 1946 and being offered a position in the Cathedral. Saydon refused the latter, saying that his literary work conflicted with high positions in the Church. Although never seeking fame for his endeavours, he expressed ire at not receiving due recognition - thus he wrote in Il-Malti in 1953: Maltese people living through the 1960s in Malta associated Saydon with the Catholic Interdiction in Malta, and the standoff between the Church and the Malta Labour Party. He was a controversial figure in the debates. On 26 March 1966, the day of the 1966 Maltese general election, Saydon wrote an opinion piece in Labour-leaning paper L-Orizzont, saying that contrary to the Pastoral Letter issued by the Bishopric, a vote for Labour did not constitute a sin, and that everyone was free to vote according to their conscience. Consequently, Saydon was suspended from his duties by then Archbishop Mikiel Gonzi. Saydon was the subject of much abuse, accused of being 'crazy', schismatic and liable for excommunication. He frequently said that he was not a political entity, but despite this played a significant role on the sidelines.  Maltese language  In his 33 years as Professor at the University of Malta, he worked tirelessly to research the Maltese language. He was well liked by his students, being a relatively young academic not given to a great ego. He would sometimes invite them to his house in Bengƒßisa. He frequently wrote about his relationship with his students: His interest in the Maltese language was sparked by the similarities between Maltese and Hebrew. He was convinced that: At the time of his personal setbacks after returning from his studies in Rome, he immersed himself into progressing the works of the University's Maltese Language Association, this having just been founded by two medic-poets, Ru≈ºar Briffa and Guze Bonnici. When Briffa resigned from the Association as he was due to study abroad, Saydon was elected as President of the group. This was around the time of a political debate in the country about whether Italian, English or indeed Maltese should be recognised as the national language of Malta. In 1932, the Government at the time tried to return Italian as the national language, and ordered that Maltese should be written and taught in a fashion that would promote the use of the Italian Language. Saydon, on behalf of the Association, sent a letter of protest to the education minister, Enrico Mizzi. The Association was then banned from holding any other meetings at the University, under the pretence of it being politically motivated. This decision was reversed a year later in 1933, and its meetings resumed. = Other works = In 1936, Saydon, together with ƒ†u≈º√® Aquilina, published Ward ta' Qari Malti an anthology of prose and poetry in Maltese. Saydon was also an accomplished author. He wrote a number of novels, including Gmajru u l-Karozzi, L-Istedina tas-Sinjura Betta, and Bejn l-Erba' ƒ¶itan tad-Dar, as well as a number of essays such as Fuq il-Monti, Tieƒ° f'Raƒßal u Fil-ƒ¶emda tal-Lejl. It is said that what Dun Karm Psaila did for poetry, Saydon did for prose. Saydon was a devotee of Saint Catherine, the patron saint of ≈ªurrieq, and wrote a religious novel in three acts, entitled simply Santa Katerina. On 12 November 1966, The University awarded him an Honorary Doctorate of Literature in recognition of his work. Priesthood Saydon's pastoral work was carried out without much fanfare - he was much loved by the villagers of Bengƒßisa, most of whom were farmers. He would celebrate an early mass at 04:30 to enable them to hear mass before they started work in the fields, and would frequently visit them in their homes. He would avoid large social gatherings, but would instead seek the company of his students, as well as members of the MUSEUM. He would frequently teach at the local branch in ≈ªurrieq, and would make monetary donations to the organisation. Saydon left the copyright of his translation of the Bible to the MUSEUM, which then went on to publish multiple editions. In 1946, Pope Pius XII appointed Saydon as a Papal chamberlain, allowing him to use the title of Monsignor. Death In 1965 Saydon suffered a stroke. In the years leading up to his death, he was twice admitted to the clergy Hospital in Attard. He died in his home in ≈ªurrieq on 22 March 1971. Following his death, a secondary school as well as a street in his hometown of ≈ªurrieq were named after him. A monument in his honour was unveiled on the hundredth anniversary of his birth, on 12 November 1995, in front of his namesake secondary school in ≈ªurrieq. There is another monument dedicated to Saydon in the grounds of the Junior College Sixth Form, in Msida. One of the main halls in the University of Malta also bears his name.

Upon leaving America, he moved to Georgetown University, where he became the regional director of the Institute of Social Order and the university's assistant archivist, where he remained until 1947. Talbot was appointed the President of Loyola College in Maryland on July 26, 1947, by the Jesuit Superior General, succeeding Edward B. Bunn. At Loyola College, he constructed the college chapel. His tenure as president came to an end on August 14, 1950, and he was succeeded by Thomas Murray. He then returned to Georgetown briefly as assistant archivist, before becoming a parish priest at St. Aloysius Church in Washington, and writing the history of the parish. He then performed retreat work at Manresa on the Severn in Annapolis, Maryland, from 1952 to 1953. That year, he returned to Georgetown, where he was a parish priest at Holy Trinity Church. There, he died of pneumonia on December 3, 1953 in the church rectory. His requiem mass was said by John Michael McNamara, the Auxiliary Bishop of Washington, at Holy Trinity on December 6, and was buried in the Jesuit Community Cemetery at Georgetown.

He succeeded his father King Bhungane II,(\\"Bhungan'omakhulukhulu\\") in 1800 and thus becoming the 6th King of the AmaHlubi to rule in what is now known as KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa) as the tribe can trace its lineage to Great Lakes of Africa then later in the Lebombo mountains area. Mthimkhulu (from Hlubi language \\"umuthi\\" means \\"tree\\" and \\"omkhulu\\" means \\"Great\\") hence \\"Mthimkhulu\\" means \\"Great Tree). He got this name because he had knowledge on kingship medicine and rainmaking of which neighboring tribes consulted with him such as King Sobhuza I of Swazi and amaNgwe tribe's leader . In modern day his name is widely misunderstood to mean \\"Great tree\\" (Nb: a tree is called \\"isihlahla\\" in Hlubi language). In 1818 Dingiswayo (a Mthethwa) chief attacked and looted the AmaNgwane clan whom, to replenish their losses of cattle, attacked the Hlubi. Mthimkhulu II united with his brother from another Hlubi branch (Mpangazitha (Pakalita)) and died in the ensuing battle in about 1818. Mthimkhulu's full brother Marhwanqa assumed the regency on behalf of the heir Dlomo II who was still a minor. When Dlomo II ascended to the throne, he gathered his troops and marched to the Zulu country to fetch his uncle‚Äôs cattle which were kept in safety by the Zulu King Dingane kaSenzangakhona for the regent Marhwanqa in the midst of his troubles with Dlomo II who himself was claiming his rightful position from his uncle. His reign was however short lived as Dingane (a Zulu King) ordered the murder of the new Hlubi king which gave way for Langalibalele I to become the king of AmaHlubi.

The plot focuses on a young couple attending a family gathering for Christmas in a rural home when a spirit wearing samurai armor begins killing members of the family‚Äîtwo of whom have psychic abilities‚Äîand their neighbors. The film is an international co-production of the United States and France, and was shot in Wisconsin. In October 2017, it was restored and released on DVD and Blu-ray by Vinegar Syndrome. Plot Sarah accompanies her new boyfriend, Ted, at his family's farmhouse in rural Wisconsin for Christmas. Ted's artist mother, Cathy, immediately senses a psychic connection with Sarah that she cannot explain, which perturbs Sarah. Sarah goes with Ted, his mother's boyfriend Gary, his sister Dolly, and his uncle Peter, on a hunting excursion in the woods. Sarah becomes upset when they prepare to shoot a deer, and flees into the woods. While running through a grove of trees, Sarah is confronted by a man who has been eviscerated, and who grabs onto her before dying. Police and paramedics arrive to recover the body of the man, whom none of them can identify. Disturbed by the incident, Sarah goes to bed early. Cathy tells Ted that she has seen Sarah before in visions. Late that night, Sarah opens a trunk to find samurai armor and a sword; Ted and Cathy find her awake in her bedroom, and assure her that the experience was a dream. Sarah, unable to sleep, momentarily joins the rest of the family in the living room. Peter drives to town, but his truck crashes. He is approached by a figure, and his throat is slashed. Meanwhile, the family's next-door neighbors Paul and Christie are attacked by a ghostly samurai armed with a sword inside their home, while Sarah levitates in her bed. Christie is impaled in the kitchen, and Paul escapes in his van upon finding her body. When his van breaks down, Paul flees on foot back to Cathy's house, pursued by the samurai. At the front door, the family find Paul's bloodied body. Soon, the house becomes subject to violent poltergeist activity. The telephone melts, and Gary is rendered unconscious when various kitchen utensils and items are hurled at him. Ted and Dolly rush upstairs to retrieve Sarah, and find the hall illuminated by a pulsing blue light. Ted and Dolly are then locked in a closet. Downstairs, Cathy attempts to communicate with the spirit attacking the house, while the home's lights and appliances surge wildly. After some time, the paranormal activity ceases, and Dolly and Ted are freed from the closet, while Gary regains consciousness. Outside, the samurai attacks and kills three men by a campfire. Inside, Ted and Sarah have sex. At dawn, Dolly goes to search for Ted, who has disappeared into the woods, and is attacked by the samurai. Gary and Ted both hear her screams, and Gary saves her by bludgeoning the samurai with an axe. Gary returns home with the samurai's armor, which Cathy and Sarah urge him to burn, but he refuses, telling them he must turn it into police. Moments later, Ted finds Sarah burning a photo in her bedroom with pyrokinesis, and she throws him across the room using telekinetic powers. Cathy confronts Sarah, who she finds adorning herself in the samurai armor, and realizes that Sarah is a reincarnation of the warrior. Cathy attempts to overpower Sarah with her psychic ability, but Sarah stabs both her and Gary to death. Ted and Dolly enter the room, manifest their psychic abilities and together manage to defeat Sarah before leaving the house. Cast Production Bloodbeat was filmed in Wisconsin on 35 mm. The director of photography, Wladimir Maule, believed that the film was being shot for television rather than for theaters, and filmed in fullscreen rather than widescreen. Writer-director Fabrice-Ange Zaphiratos was under the influence of drugs during at least some of the writing process and the filming; he has stated that the film's title, Bloodbeat, is a reference to the accelerated heartbeat experienced while high. Reception Writer John Stanley stated that \\"Fabrice-Ange Zaphiratos deserves a nod for making a gore film in which he blends psychic and slasher genres\\", though he noted that the gore elements are \\"minimal\\", as the film instead \\"goes for weirdness through music (some of it classical), enigmatic characters and a sexual link between the sister and the spectral samurai.\\" Michael Gingold of Rue Morgue wrote that Bloodbeat is \\"essentially an 86-minute non sequitur, full of odd dialogue, random characters, sudden bursts of cheesy optical-effects lunacy, sex/death juxtapositions that never make sense [...] While the movie rarely has its desired effect, it does keep you watching, just to see what bit of nuttiness Zaphiratos will pull out of his hat next.\\" Zachary Paul of Bloody Disgusting wrote that the plot of Bloodbeat is \\"esoteric at best\\", but that it \\"managed to cast a spell on me that had me mesmerized from beginning to end. Like a nice fluffy blanket on a chilly winter night, the film lulled me into its grasp with every illogical turn.\\" Rob Hunter of Film School Rejects wrote: \\"I'd be lying if I said I had a clue what the hell was going on plot-wise\\", but noted that \\"the movie manages some interesting visuals along its confusing journey.\\" Brian Orndorf of Blu-ray.com wrote that the film \\"has the appearance of a campy good time with a bad, bad movie\\" but that \\"it becomes a chore to watch\\". He lamented that \\"there should be a lot more consistent craziness when dealing with a film that pits a ghost samurai against an amateur painter.\\" Home media By 1985, Bloodbeat was released on VHS by Trans World Entertainment. On October 24, 2017, the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Vinegar Syndrome, featuring a 4K restoration of the film taken from a 35 mm print that suffered from mold and moisture damage. The Vinegar Syndrome release also includes a commentary track by Fabrice-Ange Zaphiratos, as well as interviews with Zaphiratos and Maule. As of December 2019, the film is available for streaming on Amazon Prime Video.

Life  Stephan was born in Bochum. After studying violin at the conservatory, he entered the Institute of Heidelberg, where he studied musicology at the University under the direction of Wolfgang Fortner. With Heinrich Besseler, Stephan went to the University of G√∂ttingen, where he obtained his doctorate in 1950 with a work on Die Tenores der Motetten √§ltesten Stils by musicologist Rudolf Gerber (1950). Carl Dahlhaus, Ludwig Finscher and Joachim Kaiser were among his classmates. He became known to the German-speaking public at large as the publisher of volume five of Das Fischer Lexikon's \\"Language\\", published in the Fischer Library in Frankfurt in 1957. In 1958, Stephan published the book on Neue Musik \\"Versuch einer kritischen Einf√ºhrung\\". His work was approved by Theodor W. Adorno with whom he remained in contact in the following years during radio broadcasts. In 1963, he moved to G√∂ttingen as soon as he obtained his habilitation. From 1965 to 1976, Stephan was the editor-in-chief of publications for the Institute for New Music and Music Education in Darmstadt.

Stephan's successor in 1992 was Albrecht Riethm√ºller. Stephan's research focused on the recent history of music since the 18th century and in particular on music from the first half of the 20th century. He has made innovative contributions to the revision of the image of the works of Gustav Mahler, Hans Pfitzner, Max Reger and Paul Hindemith, as well as to the recognition of the importance of the Second Vienna School for the history of music, Arnold Sch√∂nberg, Alban Berg and Anton Webern. As a publisher, Stephan contributed to the general editions of Arnold Sch√∂nberg's and Alban Berg's musical works (1989‚Äì1996).

Kang serves as the head bartender at The Dorsey at The Venetian in Las Vegas, Nevada in the United States. Her work has been featured on KNPR and in The Atlantic, GQ, Food & Wine, Men's Health, Forbes Las Vegas Weekly and Eater. Kang was named \\"Most Imaginative Bartender of the Year\\" by the United States Bartenders' Guild and Bombay Sapphire in 2014 and the following year, she was named the Nevada Restaurant Association's Bartender of the Year. She was named one of Wine Enthusiast's top \\"40 Under 40 Tastemakers\\" in 2017. Early life and career Juyoung Kang was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. When she was 18-years-old, she answered a want ad and was hired as a banquet server. Eventually, she became a bartender at the restaurant after a bartender failed to show up for their shift to work during a wedding with 300 guests. To familiarize herself with different spirits, Kang would go to local liquor stores and make notes about the different beverages sold. Kang was in college at the time, with hopes of working in marketing or filmmaking. She also studied wine, with interest in becoming a sommelier. In a 2016 interview with The Atlantic, Kang described school and studying wine as boring, and decided, after a tasting of Johnnie Walker whiskey, to pursue a career in bartending. Career > When you're creating a beverage menu, it's not about you, your creativity, > or how cool your drinks are. It's about the guests that are sitting at your > table. ‚Äì Juyoung Kang, 2016 Kang decided to relocate from Philadelphia to California, where she preferred the California bartending trends of using fresh fruit. \\"It wasn't just about Jack and Cokes,\\" she said in a 2016 interview. In Los Angeles, she bartended at The Peninsula Beverly Hills, followed by the Thompson Hotel. Eventually, she relocated to Las Vegas, where she worked at Comme √áa and Rose.Rabbit.Lie. at the Cosmopolitan. At Comme √áa, Kang was mentored by bartender Sam Ross. She left the Cosmopolitan and opened Park on Fremont and Commonwealth, both in Downtown Las Vegas. She returned to the Las Vegas Strip and worked at The Linq's BLVD Cocktail Co. Kang was lead bartender at Delmonico's Steakhouse at The Venetian from 2015 until 2017, taking over the bar from Max Solano. During her time at Delmonico's, Kang not only designed the seasonal cocktail menus, but also oversaw the restaurant's extensive whiskey selection. While at Delmonico's, Kang was named the Nevada Restaurant Association's Bartender of the Year. Eventually, Kang left Delmonico's to become head mixologist at the Dorsey, which opened in 2016, also at the Venetian. At the Dorsey, Kang oversees the bar's Dorsey Sessions program, which brings bartenders from popular bars around the world to serve as bartenders in residence. In 2018, Kang created a mint-based syrup for Cocktail Artist. =Style and cocktails= Kang describes designing a cocktail menu as a \\"long process.\\" She notes that in Philadelphia, her drinks were more \\"booze forward,\\" while in California, the drinks are longer lasting and \\"more refreshing,\\" with Las Vegas cocktail culture being a bit of both styles. Two of Kang's favorite types of drinks, and their variations, are a John Collins and Ramos Gin Fizz. In 2014, Kang was named Most Imaginative Bartender of the Year by the United States Bartenders' Guild and Bombay Sapphire for her variation on a Ramos Gin Fizz, the Lacy Fizz, which used a syrup made with eight spices and was garnished with flowers. Personal life Three of Kang's favorite Las Vegas restaurants are Chada Thai, Raku and Izakaya Go. Kang's favorite bars include Other Mama, The Sand Dollar Lounge, District One Kitchen & Bar, Atomic Liquors, Bardot Brasserie, Herbs & Rye, the Vesper Bar, and the Laundry Room, the latter which she helped open. When Kang patronizes a bar, she asks the bartender to make whatever they want for her, preferring \\"a bit booze forward and bittersweet\\" cocktails.

It was established by Governor Philip Gidley King by drawing men from the New South Wales Corps, the British garrison in the colony. Normally consisting of one or two non-commissioned officers and six privates, the Guard provided an escort to the governor and carried his despatches to outposts across the colony. From 1802, the men of the Guard were drawn from convicts pardoned by King. Men from the unit were deployed during the Castle Hill convict rebellion of 1804 and a trooper of the Guard assisted in the capture of two of the rebel leaders. After King was succeeded by William Bligh in 1806, the Guard reverted to being drawn from the New South Wales Corps. The unit seems to have been absent during the Corps' 1808 mutiny against Bligh and, by one report, supported it. It was ordered to disband by the Earl of Liverpool but was granted a reprieve in 1812 by Liverpool's successor Earl Bathurst. Viscount Goderich ordered disbandment again in 1832 and Governor Richard Bourke transformed the unit into the Mounted Orderlies in 1834. These were absorbed into the New South Wales Mounted Police in 1836 and continued as a separate component within that force until at least 1860.  Formation  alt=Black-and-white portrait of an early-19th-century gentleman in uniform with epaulettes The Guard was raised in the British Colony of New South Wales in late 1800 at the initiative of Governor Philip Gidley King. An order was sent from King to Lieutenant Colonel William Paterson of the New South Wales Corps on 26 December 1800 requiring the corps to provide a non-commissioned officer (NCO) and six privates to act as a bodyguard to King. King intended to utilise the men as messengers to carry despatches and specified that the men must be capable of riding a horse. Six men and a corporal were identified, some of whom had served in cavalry regiments, and these were serving in the role by early 1801. King provided horses and cavalry equipment from colony government funds and authorised a 1 shilling per day pay rise to the corporal and 6 pence to the privates. The Guard wore the British light dragoon uniform throughout its service and was armed with the pattern 1796 light cavalry sabre. Historian Clem Sargent described the unit as \\"one of the lesser known of the military organisations in the early history of the Colony of New South Wales\\". Its obscurity may derive from its informal origins; being raised by the governor without authority from Whitehall and never authorised by the War Office, the men remained formally members of their original units. According to Sargent, the Guard was the \\"first full-time military unit raised in Australia\\". The Guard carried the governor's despatches sent to far-flung garrison outposts across the colony and was particularly busy in the early years due to unrest among newly arrived Irish convicts. Many of these men were Republican revolutionaries, members of the Society of United Irishmen sentenced to transportation following capture after the 21 June 1798 Battle of Vinegar Hill. By 1 March 1802, the unit had dwindled to just the corporal and four privates.  Use of pardoned convicts  alt=Painting of an early-19th-century gentleman seated on a chair and holding an envelope From 12 October 1802, the men of the Guard ceased to be drawn from the New South Wales Corps, possibly as a result of a disagreement between King and Paterson. Instead, King drew members from prisoners in good standing, whom he pardoned ‚Äì a move that upset Paterson. King clashed frequently with the members of the New South Wales Corps over their monopoly on the trade in rum and misuse of convict labour. In 1801, King prevented the landing of of alcohol. A series of disputes culminated in the wounding of Paterson in a duel with one of his captains, John Macarthur, who was heavily involved in the rum trade. King sent Macarthur to England to face trial, but the advocate-general refused to hear the case and Macarthur was freed. King's employment of ex-convicts in the Guard was known to the Colonial Office in London and appears to have received tacit sanction, despite the irregularity of such an arrangement. Historian David Clune notes that because of King's efforts to restrict the rum trade, safeguard the colony's women, children and aborigines, and stamp out corruption in use of convict labour and land grants, the Guard was \\"viewed more with amusement than anger in London\\". King placed the Guard under the command of Captain John Piper of the New South Wales Corps in February 1803 to assist with the recapture of escaped convicts near Parramatta. Piper refused to make use of the men and ordered them to remain at Government House in Sydney. This angered King who complained to Major George Johnston, commanding the corps while Paterson was ill. Johnston replied that the men of the Guard could not be considered soldiers as they were not subject to the Articles of War and also questioned if they were reliable enough to have earned their pardons. King's reply stated that the men were as respectable as those in the New South Wales Corps, at least seventy of whom were also former convicts. The disagreement ended with the replacement of Piper as commandant at Parramatta by Captain Edward Abbott; the convicts were recaptured and two were executed. Major Johnston himself later made use of the Guard and commented favourably upon their conduct. Despite rumours of impending revolt among the Irish convicts, the remainder of 1803 was quiet for the Guard. That November, King pardoned George Bridges Bellasis, a former lieutenant in an East India Company artillery unit who had been transported for killing a fellow officer in a duel. King granted Bellasis the rank of a lieutenant of artillery and placed him in command of the Guard.  Castle Hill convict rebellion alt=Early-19th-century painting of soldiers in a field engaging a group of men standing on a small rise Unrest among the Irish convicts led to the Castle Hill convict rebellion, which broke out at 8 pm on 4 March 1804. The convicts were headed for Parramatta and King, with his provost marshal and four men of the Guard, set out for that settlement immediately. One trooper of the Guard was sent to carry orders to Major Johnston who was at his house in Annandale. Johnston was to assemble forces to intercept the convicts. The convicts retreated ahead of Johnston's force, through Toongabbie, but were caught at Castle Hill before they could reach the Hawkesbury. Johnston, intending to delay the convicts whilst he assembled his forces, sent the Guard's Trooper Anlezark to parley with them. The convicts removed Anlezark's pistol flints, rendering his weapons useless, but allowed him to return unharmed. Johnston decided to speak with the convict leaders in person, accompanied by Anlezark. The convicts refused to surrender and began forming up on a nearby hill, later nicknamed Vinegar Hill. Johnston requested another meeting with the convicts at which he and Anlezark drew their pistols and seized two of the convict leaders. Men of the New South Wales Corps then advanced on the hill. The convicts were quickly defeated and the rebellion ended. The next day, Johnston wrote to King that there had been 250 \\"Runaways\\" and his force had \\"been under the necessity of killing nine and wounding a great many ‚Äì the number we cannot ascertain. We have taken 7 prisoners and 7 stand of Arms, and other Weapons ...\\". Among others, his letter mentioned \\"the two Troopers\\" favourably. The battle, which became known as the Second Battle of Vinegar Hill, is illustrated in a contemporary painting now in the collection of the National Library of Australia. The painting depicts Anlezark (erroneously shown as a corporal) drawing his pistol and ordering a rebel leader: \\"Croppy lay down\\". Anlezark, a convicted burglar and fourteen-year British Army cavalry veteran, was promoted to corporal in the Guard in May 1804, replacing the existing NCO who was discharged for \\"gross abuse to a superintendent\\". The Guard's actions in quelling the rebellion and a favourable report from Johnston led King to propose increasing the unit to thirty men. It seems this was never implemented; such an action required the approval of the British colonial secretary, which was not forthcoming.  Bligh and the Rum Rebellion  alt=Painting of three soldiers dragging a uniformed gentleman from under a bed King was succeeded as governor by William Bligh in August 1806. Bligh immediately set about reforming the colony, banning the use of rum as a de facto currency. However, this action, together with his bad temper and blunt manner, made him many enemies, including Macarthur who had returned to New South Wales. Bligh arrested Macarthur in early January 1808 for violating the alcohol-related import restrictions. Johnston, who now commanded the New South Wales Corps in Sydney, marched on Government House and arrested Bligh in an act known as the Rum Rebellion. It is unclear where the men of the Guard were during Bligh's arrest but the unit had reverted to being provided from men of the New South Wales Corps and, given the men's divided loyalties, probably chose to absent themselves on the day of the rebellion. Bligh's provost marshal William Gore, who was also arrested, later recalled being visited by members of the Guard during his imprisonment and alleged that Macarthur, who set himself up as colonial secretary, was attended by two members of the unit.  Later service  alt=Painted portrait of an early-19th-century gentleman in a uniform with epaulettes Lachlan Macquarie, dispatched by the British government to assume the office of governor and restore order, arrived in the colony in December 1809. The New South Wales Corps, renamed the 102nd Regiment of Foot, was recalled to Britain and replaced by the 73rd Regiment of Foot which arrived on 1 January 1810. By April of that year the Guard consisted of a sergeant, a corporal and six troopers. One trooper had survived from King's administration, but the majority were former New South Wales Corps men who had transferred to the 73rd Regiment. At this time the supplementary pay, funded by the colonial government, was 1 shilling 6 pence per day for the sergeant, 1 shilling for the corporal and 6 pence for the troopers. During his term, Macquarie authorised the construction of a brick-built barracks and stables, with capacity for sixteen horses, in Sydney for the Guard. Macquarie saw the advantages of the unit in carrying despatches and in providing personal protection to \\"visit distant Interior parts of the Colony, or penetrate into the Wild Jungles and Forests of it, inhabited by Savages, Who probably Might be induced to take a treacherous Advantage of his Unprotected Situation, Were he to go Amongst them without a Guard\\". He sought to increase their strength to twelve men but when news of this reached the British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, the Earl of Liverpool, he refused to grant permission and demanded the unit be disbanded. In 1812, Macquarie requested this decision be rescinded as most other British colonies had a unit of regular or militia cavalry at their disposal; he claimed that he \\"felt very much hurt\\" at being \\"singled out as Undeserving this Honor\\". Macquarie maintained the unit until it was approved later in 1812 by Liverpool's successor, the Earl Bathurst. Bathurst also sanctioned an increase in size to twelve troopers, plus the sergeant and corporal. Despite Bathurst's permission being granted, the unit's nominal strength remained at eight men until the end of Macquarie's tenure in 1821. The unit was kept up to strength with replacements drawn from the British regiment on garrison duty in the colony which, from 1817, was the 48th Regiment of Foot. The Guard's duties at this time included escorting the governor on visits around the colony and announcing guests at the governor's balls. The Guard sergeant from 1808 to 1822 was Charles Whalan who became good friends with Macquarie, accompanying him on personal holidays and being one of the last people to see him off on his return to Britain in 1821.  Disbandment  alt=Painted portrait of an early-19th-century gentleman The Guard survived through the governorships of Thomas Brisbane (1821‚Äì25) and Ralph Darling (1825‚Äì31). When newly arrived governor Richard Bourke disclosed an expenditure of ¬£112 16s 6d in his December 1831 report, this was queried by the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, Viscount Goderich, who ordered the unit disbanded. Bourke, who considered the full title of the Guard as \\"much too lofty for so trifling an establishment\\", responded by establishing the Mounted Orderlies as a replacement in 1834. These were drawn from the New South Wales Mounted Police, and commanded by Bourke's aide-de- camp. Upon learning of this, Goderich ordered their disbandment. Bourke transferred the unit to the New South Wales Mounted Police on 1 July 1836 and they continued to serve the governor until at least 1860. Sargent notes that the ambiguous status of the Governor's Body Guard of Light Horse was indicative of the difficulty the British government had in understanding the colony in this period. The British were keen to restrict expenses incurred by the government of the colony and, without an understanding of the local conditions, saw no reason for the governor to have a personal bodyguard.

History Mike Speciale is known to have an organized band by mid 1921 that was based in Norfolk, Virginia, his place of residence at the time. In 1924 he was the office manager for Cosmopolitan Orchestras, Inc., Ray Miller's booking agency.

His band focused on melody and dance-ability, but injected jazz flavorings into the performances.

Named after the Cumbria town of Workington, the term was first used ahead of the 2019 general election. Workington man describes the stereotypical swing voter who it was believed would determine the election result. Their support of the Conservatives in the 2019 election helped the party break the Labour Party's Red Wall of safe seats. The term was invented by Onward, a think tank supporting the Conservatives, with a Guardian article describing the characteristics of Workington man as a northern male over the age of 45 without a university degree, who enjoys rugby league, and who had previously supported Labour but voted for Brexit in the 2016 referendum. The Financial Times described the term as \\"just the latest depressing political caricature\\". The term is similar to political stereotypes used at previous elections, such as Worcester woman, who were thought to define the characteristics of a key target voter. Labour had held the Workington constituency for most of its 100-year history, with the exception being the period following the 1976 by- election, which saw a Conservative candidate elected against a backdrop of Labour in government at national level. Less than three years after this by- election victory, the seat returned to Labour at the 1979 general election. Going into the 2019 general election, it was seen as a key marginal seat for the Conservatives to win from Labour. On a 9.7% swing, it fell to the Conservatives on election night, marking the first time the seat had elected a Conservative at a general election.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. The DB-1 design was developed into the DB-2 in 1981, with modifications that included a walk-through transom, lighter weight, more ballast and increased sail area. Production The design was built by Dehler Yachts, owned by the Dehler brothers, Willi and Heinz, in West Germany starting in 1981, but it is now out of production. Design Like the DB-1, the DB-2 is one of several variations of Stadt design 320. It is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a fractional sloop rig with running backstays, a raked stem, a reverse transom, an internally mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of lead ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel fitted. The boat is fitted with a Yanmar diesel engine for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . The design has a head located forward and no \\"V\\"-berth, the bow area being reserved for sail storage since the boats were delivered with 11 different sails. The galley is amidships on the port side and includes a two- burner stove. No icebox is provided. Sleeping accommodation consists of two settee berths, two quarter berths and two pilot berths. A navigation station id provided on the starboard side and includes chart storage. For racing all the lines are led to the cockpit. Storage is provided under the cockpit. The design uses both standing and running backstays and has winches for the running backstays. There are also two winches for the genoa sheets and two winches for halyards. The mainsheet traveller is located across the cockpit. Track-mounted Barber haulers are provided for both the jib and genoa to control sail twist downwind when sheets are eased. The boom vang is a solid tube design and a Cunningham is fitted for sail adjustment. The design has a PHRF racing average handicap of 129. Operational history The design came in first, second, third and fifth places in the 1984 IOR 3/4 ton cup races held in Kiel, West Germany. In a 1992 review Richard Sherwood wrote, \\"The db is claimed to be the fastest one-design production 3/4-tonner in the world, and she has won at Cowes, at Kiel, and in the Southern Ocean Racing Circuit.

It is, beside the Ising model in 2D and the XY model in 2D, one of the few theories, which can be solved analytically and which predicts a phase transition at a temperature T > 0.  Main idea  Melting of 2D crystals is mediated by the dissociation of topological defects, which destroy the order of the crystal. In 2016, Michael Kosterlitz and David Thouless were awarded with the Nobel prize in physics for their idea, how thermally excited pairs of \`\`virtual¬¥¬¥ dislocations induce a softening (described by renormalization group theory) of the crystal during heating. The shear elasticity disappears simultaneously with the dissociation of the dislocations, indicating a fluid phase.M. Kosterlitz: Nobelvortrag 2016 Based on this work, David Nelson and Bertrand Halperin showed, that the resulting hexatic phase is not yet an isotropic fluid. Starting from a hexagonal crystal (which is the densest packed structure in 2D), the hexatic phase has a six- folded director field, similar to liquid crystals. Orientational order only disappears due to the dissociations of a second class of topological defects, named disclinations. Peter Young calculated the critical exponent of the diverging correlations length at the transition between crystalline and hexatic. KTHNY theory predicts two continuous phase transitions, thus latent heat and phase coexistence is ruled out. The thermodynamic phases can be distinguished based on discrete versus continuous translational and orientational order. One of the transitions separates a solid phase with quasi-long range translational order and perfect long ranged orientational order from the hexatic phase. The hexatic phase shows short ranged translational order and quasi-long ranged orientational order. The second phase transition separates the hexatic phase from the isotropic fluid, where both, translational and orientational order is short ranged. The system is dominated by critical fluctuations, since for continuous transitions, the difference of energy between the thermodynamic phases disappears in the vicinity of the transition. This implies, that ordered and disordered regions fluctuate strongly in space and time. The size of those regions grows strongly near the transitions and diverges at the transition itself. At this point, the pattern of symmetry broken versus symmetric domains is fractal. Fractals are characterized by a scaling invariance ‚Äì they appear similar on an arbitrary scale or by arbitrarily zooming in (this is true on any scale larger than the atomic distance). The scale invariance is the basis to use the renormalization group theory to describe the phase transitions. Both transitions are accompanied by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Unlike for melting in three dimensions, translational and orientational symmetry breaking does not need to appear simultaneously in 2D, since two different types of topological defects destroy the different types of order. = Background = Michael Kosterlitz and David Thouless tried to resolve a contradiction about 2D crystals: on one hand side, the Mermin-Wagner theorem claims that symmetry breaking of a continuous order-parameter cannot exist in two dimensions. This implies, that perfect long range positional order is ruled out in 2D crystals. On the other side, very early computer simulations of Berni Alder and Thomas E. Wainwright indicated crystallization in 2D. The KTHNY theory shows implicitly that periodicity is not a sufficient criterion for a solid (this is already indicated by the existence of amorphous solids like glasses. Following M. Kosterlitz, a finite shear elasticity defines a 2D solid, including quasicrystals in this description. = Structure factor in 2D = Figure 1: Structure factor of a) an isotropic fluid, b) the hexatic phase, c) a crystal in two dimensions. All three thermodynamic phases and their corresponding symmetries can be visualized using the structure factor : S(\\\\vec{q}) =\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\langle\\\\sum_{ij}e^{-i\\\\vec{q}(\\\\vec{r}_i-\\\\vec{r}_j)}\\\\rangle . The double sum runs over all positions of particle pairs I and j and the brackets denote an average about various configurations. The isotropic phase is characterized by concentric rings at q = 2\\\\pi / a , if a = 1/\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho} is the average particle distance calculated by the 2D particle density \\\\rho . The (closed packed) crystalline phase is characterized by six-fold symmetry based on the orientational order. Unlike in 3D, where the peaks are arbitrarily sharp ( \\\\delta-peaks), the 2D peaks have a finite width described with a Lorenz-curve. This is due to the fact, that the translational order is only quasi-long ranged as predicted by the Mermin-Wagner theorem. The hexatic phase is characterized by six segments, which reflect the quasi-long ranged orientational order. The structure factor of Figure 1 is calculated from the positions of a colloidal monolayer (crosses at high intensity are artefacts from the Fourier transformation due to the finite (rectangular) field of view of the ensemble). = Interaction between dislocations = Figure 2: If Youngs modulus becomes 16 \\\\pi , elasticity disappears discontinuously and the crystal melts. To analyse melting due to the dissociation of dislocations, one starts with the energy H_{loc} as function of distance between two dislocations. An isolated dislocation in 2D is a local distortions of the six- folded lattice, where neighbouring particles have five- and seven nearest neighbours, instead of six. It is important to note, that dislocations can only be created in pairs, due to topological reasons. A bound pair of dislocations is a local configuration with 5-7-7-5 neighbourhood. : H_{loc} = - \\\\frac{a^2 Y}{8 \\\\pi} \\\\sum_{k eq l} \\\\Big[ \\\\vec{b}(\\\\vec{r}_k)\\\\cdot\\\\vec{b}(\\\\vec{r}_l) \\\\ln \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\vec{r}_{k,l}}{a} - \\\\frac{[\\\\vec{b}(\\\\vec{r}_k) \\\\cdot \\\\Delta\\\\vec{r}_{k,l}][\\\\vec{b}(\\\\vec{r}_l) \\\\cdot \\\\Delta\\\\vec{r}_{k,l}]}{\\\\Delta r^2_{i,j}}\\\\Big] + E_c \\\\cdot N_{loc} The double sum runs over all positions of defect pairs k and l, \\\\Delta\\\\vec{r}_{k,l} = \\\\vec{r}_k-\\\\vec{r}_l measures the distance between the dislocations. \\\\vec{b} is the Burgers vector and denotes the orientation of the dislocation at position Orte \\\\vec{r}_k . The second term in the brackets brings dislocations to arrange preferentially antiparallel due to energetic reasons. Its contribution is small and can be neglected for large distance between defects. The main contribution stems from the logarithmic term (the first one in the brackets) which describes, how the energy of a dislocation pair diverges with increasing distance. Since the shortest distance between two dislocations is given approximatively by the average particle distance a , the scaling of distances with a prevents the logarithm \\\\ln \\\\frac{\\\\Delta\\\\vec{r}_{k,l}}{a} to become negative. The strength of the interaction is proportional to Young's modulus Y given by the stiffness of the crystal lattice. To create a dislocation from an undisturbed lattice, a small displacement on a scale smaller than the average particle distance a is needed. The discrete energy associated with this displacement is usually called core energy Energie E_c and has to be counted for each of the N_{lok} dislocations individually (last term). An easy argument for the dominating logarithmic term is, that the magnitude of the strain induced by an isolated dislocation decays according mit \\\\propto \\\\frac{1}{r} with distance. Assuming Hooke's approximation, the associated stress is linear with the strain. Integrating the strain ~1/r gives the energy proportional to the logarithm. The logarithmic distance dependence of the energy is the reason, why KTHNY-theory is one of the few theories of phase transitions which can be solved analytically: in statistical physics one has to calculate partition functions, e.g. the probability distribution for \`\`all¬¥¬¥ possible configurations of dislocation pairs given by the Boltzmann distribution e^{\\\\frac{H_{lok}}{k_BT}} . Here, k_BT is the thermal energy with Boltzmann constant k_B . For the majority of problems in statistical physics one can hardly solve the partition function due to the enormous amount of particles and degrees of freedoms. This is different in KTHNY theory due to the logarithmic energy functions of dislocations H_{loc} and the e-function from the Boltzmann factor as inverse which can be solved easily.  Example  We want to calculate the mean squared distance between two dislocations considering only the dominant logarithmic term for simplicity: : \\\\langle r^2 \\\\rangle = \\\\frac{\\\\int r^2 \\\\cdot e^{-\\\\frac{Ya \\\\ln(r/a)}{4\\\\pi k_B T}}d^2r}{\\\\int e^{-\\\\frac{Ya \\\\ln(r/a)}{4\\\\pi k_B T}}d^2r} \\\\sim \\\\frac{2-\\\\frac{Y\\\\cdot a}{4\\\\pi k_B T}}{4-\\\\frac{Y\\\\cdot a}{4\\\\pi k_B T}} This mean distance \\\\langle r^2 \\\\rangle \\\\to 0 tends to zero for low temparatures ‚Äì dislocations will annihilate and the crystal is free of defects. The expression diverges \\\\langle r^2 \\\\rangle \\\\to \\\\infty , if the denominator tends to zero. This happens, when \\\\frac{Y\\\\cdot a}{4\\\\pi k_B T} = 4 . A diverging distance of dislocations implies, that they are dissociated and do not form a bound pair. The crystal is molten, if several isolated dislocations are thermally excited and the melting temperature T_m is given by Young‚Äôs modulus: : \\\\frac{Y \\\\cdot a}{k_B T_m} = 16 \\\\pi The dimensionless quantity 16 \\\\pi is a universal constant for melting in 2D and is independent of details of the system under investigation. This example investigated only an isolated pair of dislocations. In general, a multiplicity of dislocations will appear during melting. The strain field of an isolated dislocation will be shielded and the crystal will get softer in the vicinity of the phase transition; Young‚Äôs modulus will decrease due to dislocations. In KTHNY theory, this feedback of dislocations on elasticity, and especially on Young‚Äôs modulus acting as coupling constant in the energy function, is described within the framework of renormalization group theory. = Renormalization of elasticity = If a 2D crystal is heated, \`\`virtual¬¥¬¥ dislocation pairs will be excited due to thermal fluctuations in the vicinity of the phase transition. Virtual means, that the average thermal energy is not large enough to overcome (two times) the core-energy and to dissociate (unbind) dislocation pairs. Nonetheless, dislocation pairs can appear locally on very short time scales due to thermal fluctuations, before they annihilate again. Although they annihilate, they have a detectable impact on elasticity: they soften the crystal. The principle is completely analogue to calculating the bare charge of the electron in quantum electrodynamics (QED). In QED, the charge of the electron is shielded due to virtual electron-positron pairs due to quantum fluctuations of the vacuum. Roughly spoken one can summarize: If the crystal is softened due to the presence of virtual pairs of dislocation, the probability (fugacity) y for creating additional virtual dislocations is enhanced, proportional to the Boltzmann factor of the core-energy of a dislocation y = e^{\\\\frac{E_C}{k_BT}} . If additional (virtual) dislocations are present, the crystal will get additionally softer. If the crystal is additionally softer, the fugacity will increase further... and so on and so forth. David Nelson, Bertrand Halperin and independently Peter Young formulated this in a mathematically precise way, using renormalization group theory for the fugacity and the elasticity: In the vicinity of the continuous phase transition, the system becomes critical ‚Äì this means that it becomes self-similar on all length scales \\\\gg a . Executing a transformation of all length scales by an factor of l , the energy E \\\\to E(l) and fugacity y \\\\to y(l) will depend on this factor, but the system has to appear identically, simultaneously due to the self similarity. Especially the energy function (Hamiltonian) of the dislocations have to be invariant in structure. The softening of the system after a length scale transformation (zooming out to visualize a larger area implies to count more dislocations) is now covered in a renormalized (reduced) elasticity. The recursion relation for elasticity and fugacity are: : \\\\frac{dY^{-1}(l)}{dl} = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\pi y^2 e^{Y(l)/8\\\\pi} I_0 \\\\Big(Y(l)/8 \\\\pi \\\\Big) - \\\\frac{3}{4} \\\\pi y^2 e^{Y(l)/8\\\\pi} I_1 \\\\Big(Y(l)/8 \\\\pi \\\\Big) : \\\\frac{dy(l)}{dl} = \\\\Big( 2 - \\\\frac{Y(l)}{8 \\\\pi} \\\\Big) y(l) + 2 \\\\pi y^2 e^{Y(l)/16\\\\pi} I_0\\\\Big(Y(l)/8 \\\\pi \\\\Big) Similar recursion relations can be derived for the shear modulus and the bulk modulus. I_0 and I_1 are Bessel functions, respectively. Depending on the starting point, the recursion relation can run into two directions. y \\\\to 0 implies no defects, the ensemble is crystalline. y \\\\to \\\\infty , implies arbitrary many defects, the ensemble is fluid. The recursion relation have a fix-point at y = 0 with E_R/k_BT = 16 \\\\pi . Now, E_R is the renormalized value instead of the bare one. Figure 2 shows Youngs‚Äômodulus as function of the dimensionless control parameter \\\\Gamma . It measures the ratio of the repelling energy between two particles and the thermal energy (which was constant in this experiment). It can be interpreted as pressure or inverse temperature. The black curve is a thermodynamic calculation of a perfect hexagonal crystal at T = 0 . The blue curve is from computer simulations and shows a reduced elasticity due to lattice vibrations at T > 0 . The red curve is the renormalization following the recursion relations, Young's modulus disappears discontinuously to zero at 16 \\\\pi . Turquoise symbols are from measurements of elasticity in a colloidal monolayer, and confirm the melting point at Y_R = 16 \\\\pi . = Interaction between disclinations = Figure 3: Frank's constant in the hexatic phase: it falls below at melting to the isotropic fluid 72/ \\\\pi , and diverges at the transition to the crystal. The system enters the hexatic phase after the dissociation of dislocations. To reach the isotropic fluid, dislocations (5-7-pairs) have to dissociate into disclinations, consisting of isolated 5-folded and isolated 7-folded particles. Similar arguments for the interaction of disclinations compared to dislocations can be used. Again, disclinations can only be created as pairs due to topological reasons. Starting with the energy H_{cli} as function of distance between two disclinations one finds: : H_{cli} = - \\\\frac{K_A\\\\cdot \\\\pi}{36} \\\\sum_{k eq l} s(\\\\vec{r}_k)\\\\cdot s(\\\\vec{r}_l) \\\\ln \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\vec{r}_{k,l}}{a} + E_s \\\\cdot N_{cli} The logarithmic term is again dominating. The sign of the interaction gives attraction or repulsion for the winding numbers +\\\\pi /3 and -\\\\pi /3 of the five- and seven-folded disclinations in a way that \`\`charges¬¥¬¥ with opposite sign have attraction. The overall strength is given by the stiffness against twist. The coupling constant F_A is called Frank's constant, following the theory of liquid crystals. E_s is the discrete energy of a dislocation to dissociate into two disclinations. The squared distance of two disclinations can be calculated the same way, as for dislocations, only the prefactor, denoting the coupling constant, has to be changed accordingly. It diverges for \\\\frac{F_A \\\\cdot \\\\pi}{36} = 4 . The system is molten from the hexatic phase into the isotropic liquid, if unbound disclinations are present. This transition temperature T_i is given by Frank's constant: : \\\\frac{F_A}{k_B T_i} = 72 / \\\\pi 72 / \\\\pi is again a universal constan. Figure 3 shows measurements of the orientational stiffness of a colloidal monolayer; Frank's constant drops below this universal constant at T_i . = Critical exponents = Continuous phase transitions (or second order phase transition following Ehrenfest notation) show critical fluctuations of ordered and disordered regions in the vicinity of the transition. The correlation length measuring the size of those regions diverges algebraically in typical 3D systems. \\\\xi = \\\\xi_0 \\\\Big(\\\\frac{T - T_c}{T_c} \\\\Big)^{- u} Here, T_c is the transition temperature and u is a critical exponent. Another special feature of Kosterlitz‚ÄìThouless transitions is, that translational and orientational correlation length in 2D diverge exponentially (see also hexatic phase for the definition of those correlation functions): : \\\\xi = \\\\xi_0 \\\\cdot e^{\\\\Big(\\\\frac{T - T_c}{T_c} \\\\Big)^{- u}} The critical exponent becomes \\\\bar u = 0{,}36963\\\\dots for the diverging translational correlation length at the hexatic ‚Äì crystalline transition. D. Nelson and B. Halperin predicted, that Frank's constant diverges exponentially with \\\\bar u at T_i , too. The red curve shows a fit of experimental data covering the critical behaviour; the critical exponent is measured to be \\\\bar u = 0{,}35 \\\\pm 0{,}02 . This value is compatible with the prediction of KTHNY theory within the error bars. The orientational correlation length at the hexatic ‚Äì isotropic transition is predicted to diverge with an exponent u = 0{,}5 . This rational value is compatible with mean-field-theories and implies that a renormalization of Frank's constant is not necessary. The increasing shielding of orientational stiffness due to disclinations has not to be taken into account ‚Äì this is already done by dislocations which are frequently present at T_i . Experiments measured a critical exponent of u = 0{,}5 \\\\pm 0{,}03 . KTHNY- theory has been tested in experiment and in computer simulations. For short range particle interaction (hard discs), simulations found a weakly first order transition for the hexatic ‚Äì isotropic transition, slightly beyond KTHNY-theory.

Her siblings included Mercedes (b. 1927), Arturo (b. 1933) and Jorge Antonio (b. 1943). After the Spanish Civil War, the family settled in Madrid, where the daughters were enrolled in the Carmelites school on Fortuny Street. But the family spent holidays in the south, where the Paz's poetic sensibility around three stimuli were developed: the lyric of oral tradition (very much alive in Lower Andalusia), the songs she heard on the radio, and the poems of Las mil mejores poes√≠as that her mother taught her to recite. Career =1940s-1956= Between 1947 and 1948, Paz wrote a \\"poetic corner\\" in the newspaper Ayer de Jerez.Ana Sof√≠a P√©rez-Bustamante Mourier, ‚ÄúLos borradores silvestres de Pilar Paz Pasamar (1947-1948)‚Äù, en Estudios de teor√≠a literaria como experiencia vital.

(in Spanish) composed of Fernando Qui√±ones, Felipe Sordo Lamadrid, Seraf√≠n Pro Hesles, Francisco Pleguezuelo, and the painter Lorenzo Cherbuy. With them, she went to C√≥rdoba in 1951 to meet the poets of the ‚ÄúCanticle‚Äù group: Pablo Garc√≠a Baena, Ricardo Molina Tenor, and Juan Bernier. Platero published collaborations of Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez, Rafael Alberti, Pedro Salinas, Vicente Aleixandre, and Gerardo Diego. The Cadiz group included other poets from the province, such as Jos√© Manuel Caballero Bonald, Julio Mariscal, and Jos√© Luis Tejada. In 1952, Paz enrolled in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters of Complutense University of Madrid, although she did not finish the degree. There, she studied with other literary figures such as D√°maso Alonso and Carlos Bouso√±o. Between 1951 and 1956, she published three books that would make her the youngest and most celebrated poet of the moment.

(in Spanish) Paz became integrated into the feminine poetic circles of Carmen Conde Abell√°n, √Ångela Figuera, Gloria Fuertes, Concha Lagos. Carmen Conde included Paz in all her anthologies, and years later, she occupied a prominent place in the Italian-Spanish bilingual anthology prepared by Maria Roman Colangeli (1964). Paz's works, Del abreviado mar (1957) and Violencia inm√≥vil (1967) appeared in the collection \\"Agora\\" edited by Concha Lagos. In those same years, Paz had a passion for the theater. In the Complutense University of Madrid, she related to students who were part of the TEU (Spanish University Theater), including Marcelo Arroitia, Jaime Ferr√°n, and Jos√© Mar√≠a Saussol Prieto. With them, she set up an adaptation of William Shakespeare's The Tempest (Madrid, 1954). She participated in dramatized readings, and came to consider a tour of Italy with La Celestina . Together with Jos√© Mar√≠a Rodr√≠guez M√©ndez, she wrote El Desv√°n, an unpublished comedy. =1957-1967= She left the university when she met Carlos Redondo Huertos. They decided to marry and settle in C√°diz.

Her four children were born in C√°diz: Pilar (1958), Mercedes (1960), Mar√≠a Eugenia (1963) and Arturo (1967). However, she published La soledad contigo in 1960. On August 12, 1963 she made a speech at the Royal Hispanic-American Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters of C√°diz where she reflected on the role of the poet.

She published La torre de Babel y otros asuntos in 1982, a book written following a strong personal crisis where confrontation with personal failure and the current world converge in the Tower of Babel as a central symbol of destruction of the word. It was the reappearance of Paz, the poet.

In the same year, 1986, Pilar reappeared with Litoral femenino, and in the anthology that Jos√© Ram√≥n Ripoll prepared for his work, La alacena (1986). The 1990s inaugurated a period of expansion. In 1990, Textos lapidarios, was published. Two storybooks: Historias balnearias y otras (1999) and Historias b√©licas (2004) followed.

Santa Fe, NM: National Park Service/Bureau of Land Management,2004. = Contadero = In the 19th century, with Fort Craig, located across the river, providing protection from Apache attacks and providing employment, a small town named Contadero was established in the vicinity of the Corrales de Contadero in the 1860s along the river on the south side of the mesa. The towns population at its peak was 140. Its prosperity lasted until the fort was abandoned in 1884. It gradually declined, especially after 1895 when plans to develop a dam down river doomed the fields of the towns farmers along the river. By 1920 the population was 63. Within a few years the Elephant Butte Reservoir rose and covered the fields in the river valley and the town of Contadero, was abandoned. Its neighboring settlement Paraje down river, soon followed.  The site today  Today there are only few remains of the settlement amongst the brush west of the railroad tracks, the ruin of the church and foundations of a house surrounded by Mexican era rock corrals.

General (R) Pervez Musharraf, informally known as the Musharraf high treason case, was a court case in which former Pakistani president and military ruler Pervez Musharraf was tried for high treason stemming from his actions on 3 November 2007 when he subverted and suspended the Constitution of Pakistan, sacking fifteen Supreme Court judges and fifty- six judges of the provincial High Courts while putting the then Chief Justice of Pakistan under house arrest. It was the first time in Pakistan's history that a former military ruler faced a trial for treason. On 17 December 2019, a special court, composed of Chief Justice of the Peshawar High Court (PHC) Waqar Ahmed Seth, Nazar Akbar of the Sindh High Court (SHC), and Shahid Karim of the Lahore High Court (LHC), found Musharraf guilty of high treason and sentenced him to death. On 13 January 2020, the Lahore High Court annulled the death sentence. Background On 31 July 2009, a 14-judge bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan declared Gen Pervez Musharraf's action of declaring emergency in November 2007, as illegal and unconstitutional in the PCO Judges case's verdict. On 5 April 2013, the Supreme Court accepted a petition filed against Musharraf that accused him of committing treason under Article 6 of the Constitution. A three-member bench headed by Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry was constituted to begin hearing the case from 8 April 2013. However, on 7 April 2013, the CJP Iftikhar Chaudhry recused himself from the bench hearing the petition. On 8 April 2013, a two-member bench led by Justice Jawwad S. Khawaja summoned Musharraf and ordered that his name be put on the Exit Control List (ECL). On 24 June 2013, in the National Assembly of Pakistan, the-then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said that his government intends to file a written request before the Supreme Court to put Musharraf on trial for treason under Article 6 of the Constitution. On 18 November 2013, the Supreme Court accepted the Sharif government's request to set up a Special Court to try Musharraf under Section 2 of the High Treason (Punishment) Act 1973 of the constitution. On 19 November 2013, Sharif approved the names of SHC Justice Faisal Arab, BHC Justice Tahira Safdar and LHC Justice Muhammad Yawar Ali for the Special Court set up under Section 4 of the Criminal Law Amendment (Special Courts) Act 1976. Case progression On 12 December 2013, the Sharif government submitted an 11-page complaint carrying five charges of high treason against Musharraf for his trial in the Special Court. On 13 December 2013, the Special Court convened its first meeting at Federal Shariat Court and summoned Musharraf to appear before it on 24 December 2013. On 2 January 2014, Musharraf was taken to the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology (AFIC) in Rawalpindi while on the way to the special court. On 7 January 2014, the AFIC submitted a medical report to the special court stating that Musharraf was suffering from triple-vessel coronary artery disease. On 18 February 2014, Musharraf finally appeared in court after avoiding twenty-two consecutive hearings, but no charges were framed against him. On 21 February 2014, the court dismissed Musharraf's plea that had challenged the special court's jurisdiction and had asked that his treason trial be held at a military court. On 31 March 2014, Musharraf was indicted for high treason charges. In March 2016, Musharraf via his counsel moved an application before the Supreme Court seeking one-time permission to go abroad for medical treatment. On 16 March 2016, the Supreme Court upheld a 2014 SHC ruling that ordered the removal of Musharraf's name from the ECL. Subsequently, on 18 March 2016, Musharraf left the country for Dubai, United Arab Emirates. On 11 May 2016, the special court declared Musharraf an absconder in the treason case for his failure to appear before the court even after multiple summons. On 19 November 2019, the special court reserved its verdict in the high treason case. On 5 December 2019, the special court said that it would announce the verdict in the high treason case against Musharraf on 17 December 2019. Verdict On 17 December 2019, the special court found Musharraf guilty of high treason and sentenced him to death under Article 6 of the Constitution in a 2‚Äì1 split verdict. On 19 December 2019, the special court released the 169-page detailed verdict authored by PHC CJ Waqar Ahmed Seth with a dissenting note from Justice Nazar Akbar. Musharraf had filed a petition in the High court challenging the judgement delivered by the high court. On 13 January 2020, the Lahore High Court annulled the death sentence calling the special court that held the trial as unconstitutional. The court also stated that the case was not framed as per the law. The unanimous verdict was delivered by a three membered full bench consisting of the judges Justice Mazahar Ali Akbar, Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti and Justice Chaudhry Masood Jahangir. The verdict given by the special court was called void by the lawyers. Musharraf's political party responded to the verdict stating \\"supremacy of the law and Constitution has been established\\".

In the Middle Ages and Renaissance was in particular an important Florentine noble family that maintained strong ties with the Catholic Church. Several people have left several traces of their lives to date, particularly bankers, knights, landlords and scholars who have had relationships with other well-known personalities, including members of the Visconti, Villani, Aldighieri and Medici families. In Old Italian, in the late 17th and early 20th centuries, it assumed the synonym of \\"whitish\\" as gallicism of the French word Blanchard, as confirmed by the linguist Salvioni. An example of literary text where it's used as word is in the D'Annunzio's work Le faville del maglio. Geographical distribution In Tuscany, the frequency of the surname is one of the highest than regional average (1:3720) in the following provinces: * Province of Siena (1:484) * Province of Grosseto (1:686) Historical origins =House of Bianciardi= Coat of arms of Bianciardi in front of the Palazzo Pretorio in Fiesole, since 1764, a member of this family had been a Podest√† ten years earlier. During the Middle Ages, they were a noble family. Over the centuries, the family left several historical traces in Italy, especially in Tuscany, also because they maintained close friendships with the Catholic Church. The first sources date back to 1321, the year in which Pietro Bianciardi became a monk of the Camaldolese order, an order of scholars founded in 1009 by people of a certain economic power. Another testimony of power we find in 1358, in which the father Giovanni Bianciardi is one of the members that approves the Statutes of reformation of the Government of the Florentine Republic, in Florence. Known as a charitable family, every year they gave 100 florins each at the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. In 1435 Angelus Iacopo Bianciardi da Sommavilla purchased a Palace from the Ricasoli family (which is, today, the oldest of all the families that formed the Florentine aristocracy and is one of the few still flourishing of feudal origin) in Castellina in Chianti, still today completely existing, the Palace became the family symbol starting from 1719 as \\"Casa Bianciardi\\" (today known as \\"Palazzo Bianciardi\\"). Until then, the Palazzo was used as a holiday residence, preferring instead to settle in the high social class of Florence. In 1557 Giovanni and Agnolo di Pier Bianciardi bought other properties around in Castellina. In 1622 Giuseppe Bianciardi was sent by the Republic as podest√† to Castelfranco di Sopra. With the death of Bartolomeo Bianciardi, the family committed each year to distribute 10 scudi to the poors of the town. In the late XVI century, the Monitore Fiorentino honor this family as an example of honest and rich citizens that performed help to the indigences with alms. =Palazzo Bianciardi= The Palace in Castellina in Chianti (Sienna) dates back to the early 1400s. It has ten rooms, in a total of two floors. For a period \\"Casa Bianciardi\\" hosted Pope Leo X. In effect on his journey to Rome, the Pope used to stay at the palace (he even had a room of his own). Out of gratitude, he will provide the de Medici coat of arms in the Palazzo (still present next to the family crest). In 1864 a small theater was created inside the Palace. In 2007 the Palazzo was renovated. To date, some members of the Bianciardi family continue to live there, one of them is also a municipal assessor, today. The Oratory of Saint Francis After the creation of an Oratory in the Villaggio di Casalta built by Andrea Bianciardi in 1713, which was blessed on 21 October 1779 by the Pievano of Castellina Niccola Moggi for commission of the Bishop of Colle Buonamici, Palazzo Bianciardi owned a chapel dedicated to Saint Francis. A private oratory since 1747 by the will of Sig. Cap. Cosimo Bianciardi that, however, was canceled after 6 years. It will then be created again, making it public, in another room of the Palazzo in 1805 by Filippo Bianciardi. There is a papal bull which attests that in the chapel of this noble family it is possible to confer the plenary indulgence on the day of St. Francis (4 October) and on the day of the forgiveness of Assisi (1 August).

Applications include language translation, image captioning, conversational models and text summarization.  History  The algorithm was developed by Google for use in machine translation. In 2019, Facebook announced its use in solving differential equations. The company claimed that it could solve complex equations more rapidly and with greater accuracy than commercial solutions such as Mathematica, MATLAB and Maple. First, the equation is parsed into a tree structure to avoid notational idiosyncrasies. An LSTM neural network then applies its standard pattern recognition facilities to process the tree. In 2020, Google released Meena, a 2.6 billion parameter seq2seq-based chatbot trained on a 341 GB data set. Google claimed that the chatbot has 1.7 times greater model capacity than OpenAI's GPT-2, whose May 2020 successor, the 175 billion parameter GPT-3, trained on a \\"45TB dataset of plaintext words (45,000 GB) that was ... filtered down to 570 GB.\\"  Technique  Seq2seq turns one sequence into another sequence. It does so by use of a recurrent neural network (RNN) or more often LSTM or GRU to avoid the problem of vanishing gradient. The context for each item is the output from the previous step. The primary components are one encoder and one decoder network. The encoder turns each item into a corresponding hidden vector containing the item and its context. The decoder reverses the process, turning the vector into an output item, using the previous output as the input context. Optimizations include: * Attention: The input to the decoder is a single vector which stores the entire context. Attention allows the decoder to look at the input sequence selectively. * Beam Search: Instead of picking the single output (word) as the output, multiple highly probable choices are retained, structured as a tree (using a Softmax on the set of attention scores). Average the encoder states weighted by the attention distribution. * Bucketing: Variable-length sequences are possible because of padding with 0s, which may be done to both input and output. However, if the sequence length is 100 and the input is just 3 items long it, expensive space is wasted. Buckets can be of varying sizes and specify both input and output lengths. Training typically uses a cross-entropy loss function, whereby one output is penalized to the extent that the probability of the succeeding output is less than 1.

She is one of two women ministers in the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) Government and holds the post Minister for Culture.  Political career  Hamdi is an outspoken campaigner for Sahrawi women's rights, the value of cultural heritage and the importance of education to young people, especially those, like many Sahrawi who are displaced from their homeland. Her work in these areas encourages international support for Sahrawi self-determination and in 2009 Hamdi led the delegation to the 2nd Pan-African Cultural Festival, held in Algiers. During the festival, Hamdi publicly called on the Kingdom of Morocco to obey international law to enable self-determination and independence for the Sahrawi people. She has been a vocal critic of the government of Morocco and their treatment of Sahrawi political prisoners, especially about a media black-out that was imposed on a group of 24 activists in 2013. = Women's rights = Speaking in public at international events is an important part of Hamdi's ministerial work. She has travelled widely discussing Sahrawi rights and the rights of Sahrawi women - women who have often taken up leadership roles within refugee camps. In 2013, Hamdi travelled to Nigeria as part of the Global Power Women Network Africa (GPWNA) event. She praised the support the Nigerian government was giving the struggle for independence and commented on how women from all countries in Africa needed to work together to claim, support and expand their human and civil rights. She travelled to the UK in 2007 to lobby Members of Parliament, at the invitation of Jeremy Corbyn. She spoke alongside activists, Aminetou Haidar and Makaela Wallinder. Hamdi had previously led, with her colleague Zahra Ramdan, the 2003 delegation of the National Union of Saharawi Women on their tour of political party conferences in the UK. This tour lasted nineteen days and they canvassed support for the Sahrawi cause and met with political leaders including Tony Blair, Jack Straw and Glenys Kinnock. In 2006, in the Week of Solidarity with the SADR held in Algeria, Hamdi spoke to the conference under the title \\"The Saharawi woman : between duty of liberation and demands of the state\\". She was part of a wider discussion which included Nouria Hafs, the Secretary General of the National Union of Algerian Women, and Saida Benhabil√®s, the President of the Algerian Women's Movement for Solidarity with Rural Women. Hamdi had previously led a 2003 delegation of Sahrawi women to the Algerian Popular Assembly, and met with its president Karim Younes. = Children's rights = Educating young people about Sahrawi heritage and culture and the access of Sahrawi young people to wider educational opportunities are important areas that Hamdi supports. In 2007, whilst in London she also spoke about the Sahrawi struggle at two schools. In 2001, Hamdi supported the delegation of Scouting and Guiding in Western Sahara to attend an international forum that eleven young people from the organisation attended. She continues to campaign for better access to education in refugee camps. = Cultural heritage = Hamdi was praised in 2014 for leading a \\"cultural resistance\\" to the occupation of the SADR, when she was welcomed to Algiers by the Algerian Minister for Culture Khalida Toumi. She has spoken out publicly about the power of culture, both in terms of identity politics in Western Sahara, but also in term of how art or poetry can be a catalyst for the cause of self- determination. In 2008, Hamdi petitioned Ko√Øchiro Matsuura, Director General of UNESCO, to support educational programmes in Sahrawi refugee camps, as well as supporting work to preserve and promote their cultural heritage for the future.  Film  Hamdi is closely involved with the Sahara International Film Festival. She launched the 12th festival in 2015 jointly with SADR Prime Minister Abdelkader Taleb Omar and Dennis Thokozani Dlomo, who is South Africa's ambassador to Algeria. Its theme was \\"Universal Justice\\" and it had 423 participants from 20 countries. During the 2012 festival, Hamdi presented the festival's highest award, The White Camel, to Javier Bardem and Alvaro Longoria for their documentary film ‚ÄúSons of the Clouds: Last Colony‚Äù.  Archives  In 2008, Hamdi visited Austria, where a team from GEZA were working to build a National Electronic Archive for Western Sahara. She has led on a variety of cultural programmes for the population in exile, from projects around violence against women, to an oral history project called \\"Tell Me, Grandfather\\" to continually build up Sahrawi cultural heritage with young people.  Arts  In 2013, Hamdi travelled to Finland to raise awareness about women's rights in Western Sahara, especially in refugee camps and to open a new exhibition of artwork by Sahrawi artist Fadel Jalifa. = Accusations of aid misappropriation = In November 2011 it was rumoured that a CD-ROM was being sent around refugee camps and on it were details of financial missappropiation of humanitarian aid, led by the Khadidja Hamdi.

Marzke was an American anthropologist. Her research focuses on the evolution of the hominin hand.  Early life and education  Mary Marzke was born Mary Walpole in Oakland, California. While in middle school and high school, ski trips with her family friends the McCowns sparked an interest in anthropology as both Professor and Mrs. McCown were physical anthropologists. Professor McCown later went on to serve as one of her Ph.D. supervisors. In 1959, she graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with an A.B. in Anthropology. Following this, she attained her M.A. in anthropology from Columbia University in New York in 1961. Marzke returned to the University of California, Berkeley to earn her Ph.D. in anthropology, completing it in 1964. Her Ph.D. supervisors at the University of California, Berkeley were Professors Theodore McCown and Sherwood Washburn. Dr. Marzke passed away on September 3, 2020, surrounded by family.  Career  Markze began her teaching career by lecturing, then instructing at Hunter Brown College (now Lehman college) in 1963. She then lectured at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill) from 1967 to 1969. The following decade, she worked as an acting assistant professor at the University of California from 1976-1977. In 1978, she began working at the Arizona State University as an adjunct visiting professor. Markze has worked at ASU since then, with a 9 year break from 1986 to 1995 when she worked as an anatomist at the Primate Foundation of Arizona. Markze has been a professor at ASU since 2004, most recently teaching courses on primate anatomy and fossil hominins. Apart from teaching, Markze has done an extensive amount of research throughout her career, with a ‚Äúspecial focus on the evolution of the hominin hand and bipedality.‚Äù Markze‚Äôs research involves ‚Äúextensive dissections, electromyography, kinematic analysis of joint angle displacement and tendon excursion, and stereophotogrammetry and laser digitizing for 3-D analysis of joint surface areas, angles and curvatures. Markze has made a number of discoveries including her work that has demonstrated the links between precision gripping, tool behaviors, and hand morphology. Markze used experimental manufacturing of prehistoric hominin tools, behavior studies of chimpanzees, and morphological analysis, to help discern which pre-modern human species were capable of tool-making. In 2000, Markze conducted a morphological and biomechanical analysis of the early hominin hand found at Olduvai Gorge. Markze's research also addressed ‚Äúthe potential of fossil hominid hands for one-handed firm precision grips and fine precision manoeuvering movements, both of which are essential for habitual and effective tool making and tool use.‚Äù In 2008, Markze‚Äôs research concluded that \\"further derived changes to the hands of other hominins such as modern humans and Neandertals did not evolve until after 2.5 Ma and possibly even later than 1.5 Ma.\\" Markze also pioneered the use of 3DGM methods to investigate the evolutionary history of the carpal bones of the hand.

He is reportedly a drug trafficker for the Gulf Cartel, a criminal group based in Tamaulipas, Mexico. According to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, between 2005 and 2014, Briones Ruiz and his network were responsible for cocaine trafficking from Mexico to the U.S., smuggling the cash proceeds back into Mexico, conducting money laundering from these earnings, and structuring financial activities to hide the illegal nature of his earnings. He did this through his family-run gasoline company, Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. A fugitive from U.S. justice, Briones Ruiz faces up to life imprisonment and up to US$10 million in fines from his drug trafficking activities alone. Early life and background Abel Briones Ruiz was born in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico, on 31 October 1973 to Abel Briones and Magdalena Ruiz Carri√≥n. His birth was registered in Matamoros in 1974. He is married to Myriam Susana Beattie Mart√≠nez. His sister is Claudia Aid√© and she is married to Rogelio Nieto Gonz√°lez. Briones Ruiz several hotels and a Matamoros-based gas company, Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V., which is located on the highway connecting Matamoros with Reynosa. According to the Public Registry of Property and Commerce (RPPC), Briones Ruiz registered Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. as a commercial entity and listed himself as a commercial business owner in 2009. In an RPPC assembly in 2012, he reported MXN$4.3 million in investments to justify an expansion in his company. That year, Pemex granted a short-term license to Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. to opened up a gas station. In January 2016, Pemex granted Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. a license to sell their standard and premium gasoline, effectively superseding the short- term license they owned. The licence allowed for Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. to operate for 30 years should they follow the conditions stipulated in the contract. Among the conditions were for Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. to ensure safety regulations, product control standards, insurance requirements, and that financial reports and transactions were kept for record-keeping.  Career  Briones Ruiz, known also by his alias \\"Cacho\\", is a suspected drug trafficker of the Gulf Cartel, a criminal group based in Tamaulipas. On 22 October 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas (S.D. Tex) filed a sealed indictment against Briones Ruiz and three of his collaborators: Beattie Mart√≠nez, Nieto Gonz√°lez, and an unnamed individual. The indictment was unsealed in court on 18 May 2015. According to the indictment, Briones Ruiz and his network conspired to smuggle with intent to distribute over of cocaine from Mexico to the U.S. between 1 January 2005 and 22 October 2014. They were also charged with money laundering and illegal financial structuring. For the drug charges, they faced from ten years to life imprisonment and up to US$10 million in fines. For the money laundering charges, they faced up to 20 years in prison and up to US$500,000 in fines. In addition, for smuggling drug proceeds internationally, they faced a maximum of 20 years in prison and US$500,000 in fines. Briones Ruiz and his wife were believed to have structured their transactions to hide the nature of their criminal activities; if found guilty, they faced up to ten years in prison and US$500,000 in fines. U.S. authorities were also seeking forfeiture of Nieto Gonz√°lez's properties. Briones Ruiz and the rest of his network are from Matamoros and U.S. authorities believe they are not residing in the U.S. The case against Briones Ruiz and his network was built and prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Hess. It included information from a joint investigation from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Texas Department of Public Safety, Cameron County District Attorney's Office, Cameron County Sheriff's Office, Willacy County Sheriff's Office, and Texas police departments of San Benito, Harlingen, Port Isabel, and Brownsville, across the border from Matamoros. = Economic sanctions = On 21 May 2015, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a branch of the United States Department of the Treasury, sanctioned Briones Ruiz under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (\\"Kingpin Act\\") for providing support to the international operations of the Gulf Cartel. He is designated as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker (SDNT). The economic sanction extends to four of Briones Ruiz's collaborators: Nieto Gonz√°lez, Beattie de Briones, Ruiz Carri√≥n and Claudia Aid√©. The sanction also extends to his company, Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. As part of the sanction, the U.S. government prohibited U.S. citizens from engaging in business activities with these entities and individuals, and froze all of their U.S.-based assets. According to the OFAC, Briones Ruiz and his collaborators are responsible for smuggling cocaine shipments from Mexico to the U.S. Southwestern border. The drugs were distributed in the U.S. states of Texas and Tennessee. The earnings generated by their drug operations were smuggled back into Mexico by Briones Ruiz's network. His network used Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. to launder the Gulf Cartel's proceeds in Mexico and the U.S., where they deposited some of their earnings in Texan bank accounts. They bought multiple properties in Texas but U.S. authorities did not confirm how many. Most of the properties were seized by the U.S. Department of Justice as part of this investigation. Investigators stated that Briones Ruiz is the head of the criminal network and uses his family to further the Gulf Cartel's operations. The information in the Kingpin Act designation was built by the DEA's field office in Brownsville and the S.D. Tex. If found guilty in a civil court, Briones Ruiz would face up to US$1.075 million in fines per violation. In a criminal court, Briones Ruiz (facing trial as a corporate officer of Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V.) would face up to 30 years in prison and up to US$5 million in fines. His corporation can face up to US$10 million in fines if a court determines that it participated in the stimulated charges. Briones Ruiz has an outstanding arrest warrant for his arrest in the U.S.; they have not issued a formal extradition request. Briones Ruiz is considered innocent until proven guilty of the drug offenses through due process. On 10 July 2019, Mexico's Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF) informed the Attorney General's Office (FGR) of the existence of eight gas stations that were suspected of being involved in money laundering. Among them was Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. The UIF highlighted that Briones Ruiz's company was sanctioned by the OFAC years back. In order to limit their suspected laundering activities, the Mexican government froze all Mexican bank accounts owned by Briones Ruiz, his sister and that of Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V. The company was also blocked from being able to generate an official Tax Administration Service (SAT) digital logo, which effectively prevents it from conducting business operations. However, Briones Ruiz and his sister responded by issuing writs of amparo to prevent the government from freezing their bank accounts. In the report, the UIF noted that another of the sanctioned gas companies, KNG Ultra S.A. de C.V. (also known as Ultragas M√©xico), made business transactions with Combustibles Briones, S.A. de C.V.

It runs on the CW Branch built by the Northern Pacific Railway from 1889‚Äì1890 and was previously used by the Eastern Washington Gateway Railroad until 2018. The WER is owned by the Western Group. History The Eastern Washington Gateway Railroad was established on June 1, 2007, after the purchase of the CW branch of the Palouse River and Coulee City Railroad (PCC) by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). The branch, which saw low traffic and high deferred maintenance costs, was slated to be abandoned by the railroad. The state purchased the line in February 2007 for $5.6 million, after lobbying from grain growers in the region. The Inland Northwest Rail Museum was constructed in 2016 in Reardan, Washington, adjacent to trackage owned by EWG. The museum is home to several pieces of historic railroad equipment from Eastern Washington. EWG went out of business on November 4, 2018, with operations assumed by Washington Eastern Railroad, a new entity operated by the Western Group. The last EWG train ran on November 3, 2018. The Western Group won the bid from WSDOT to operate the CW Branch on September 4, 2018. In late 2018, WER began building an extension on the Geiger Spur to serve Spokane International Airport and surrounding industrial facilities. Route The WER operates on the state-owned CW Branch. The route runs starts in Cheney in a junction with the BNSF Railway line. The route then proceeds along SR 904 to Four Lakes. At Four Lakes, the tracks cross under I-90 and meet the grain elevator operated by HighLine Grain Growers. From here, the tracks continue north where they connect with the Geiger Spur, owned by the Spokane County government, that connects with Airway Heights. The tracks follow SR 902 to Medical Lake, then turn north again to US 2. The tracks follow US 2 for the remainder of the route to where it terminates in Coulee City. Operations The WER currently hauls scoot trains one to four times a week depending on the time of year. It goes out to Coulee City dropping off empty cars at various communities and comes back one to two days later picking up those loaded cars and taking them to the grain storage operated by HighLine Grain Growers in Four Lakes. After the grain is unloaded, WER heads back out and repeats the process. The company also runs a more infrequent train up the Geiger Spur that mainly transports steel. Occasionally they will run a Davenport Turn which is a hospital train. It takes broken train cars to Davenport to be repaired and brings the fixed cars to their destination. When the HighLine grain storage is full, WER contacts BNSF, who will send a train via the WER trackage from Cheney and take it elsewhere.

In 2019 she moved back to Cambridge as a Lecturer in Animal Ecology and NERC Independent Research Fellow and is a visiting lecturer at UEA  Research  Dicks' research looks at the connections between agricultural ecology, agricultural policy and the food and farming industry. She supports evidence based practice and policy for sustainable agricultural management and conservation interventions. Dicks' research has shown a need for redundancy in natural ecosystems, that is a need for extra resources and species to create longterm resilience. She collaborates internationally and took part in an international assessment of pollinating animals in conjunction with the IPBES in 2016. Dicks has highlighted the importance of insect pollinators for food crops such as chocolate and coffee and supported the 2013 EU moritorium and subsequent ban on neonicotinoid insecticides. Dicks has also researched the importance of vertebrate pollinators such as birds and bats and has been involved in horizon scanning to find future threats to pollinators such as agricultural expansions, use of agrochemicals and emerging disease. Her research has shown a lack of awareness of how pollinator decline could affect food supply chains. As well as pollinating insects, Dicks also promotes the important of insects for biological control and decomposition  Awards  Dicks was awarded the John Spedan Lewis Medal in 2017 for making a significant and innovative contribution to conservation. In 2018 Dicks was awarded the DEFRA Bees' Needs Champion Award for raising public awareness of the needs of pollinators.

Introduction  Soledad outlines a story about a girl (Soledad) who could not get away from her contentious family fast enough despite the petty fights and the endless tragedies that they experienced. At some point, Soledad found her way out and enrolled for an art course at Cooper Union. However, after finding her way out, Soledad returns to Washington Heights‚Äô neighborhood after mother, Olivia, mysteriously becomes ill. Evidently, Olivia is in a state where she is considered a ‚Äúliving ghost‚Äù . It appears that she is in an emotional coma and the return of Soledad is regarded as the only cure. After her return to 164th street, Soledad tries to tame her cousin Flaca‚Äôs unruly behavior and resists falling for a neighborhood boy, Ritche, besides dealing with the greatest challenge she was facing at the time. Evidently, Soledad was confronting the daunting memory she had with her mother in the past as well as salvaging their broken relationship Also, during her return, Soledad is forced to confront her family to understand the secrets behind the death of her father. A significant section of the novel is provided from the perspective of Soledad‚Äôs female relatives, Flaca and Gorda. Flaca is constantly in rivalry with Soledad. Gorda is Soledad‚Äôs aunt, who is also known as a witch (bruja), who treats her sister‚Äôs ailments with ceremonies and home remedies. The story is also unveiled from Olivia‚Äôs point of view through the use of flashbacks and italicized dream narration. The three characters are more interesting in comparison to Soledad. Evidently, when Cruz outlines fresh details of rhythms and behavior of Dominican community life, the three are rarely left out. Soledad is an important literary piece which presents a story of chaos and culture, integrity with family and mysticism while examining the concepts from the perspective of a Latinx.

Martinez is the current International Racquetball Federation (IRF) World Champion in Women's Singles, winning the title at the 2018 World Championships. Martinez has competed on the Guatemala National Team at international tournaments since 2012, most recently she was a silver medalist in Women's Doubles (with Maria Renee Rodriguez) at the 2019 Pan American Games.  2009-2013 - Early years  Martinez first competed at the International Racquetball Federation (IRF) Junior World Championships in 2009 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, where she lost to Mary Zeng (USA), 10-15, 15-13, 11-3, in the semi-finals of Girl's U10. But she won Girl's U10 the next year in Los Angeles, when she defeated Mexican Monserrat Mejia, 15-1, 6-15, 11-2, in the final. Martinez represented Guatemala at the World Championships for the first time in 2012, when she was 13. She competed in Women's Doubles with Maria Renee Rodriguez, and lost in the Round of 16 to the South Korean team of Malhee Kwon and Mi Ok An, 10-15, 15-14, 11-7. But they defeated South Korea in Women's Team event Round of 16, 2 matches to 1, and then lost to Canada in quarterfinals, 2-0.

She lost to Maria Paz Mu√±oz of Ecuador, 15-4, 15-9, in the Round of 32 in singles, and as in 2013, Martinez and Rodriguez lost in the Round of 16, but this time to Costa Ricans Melania Sauma and Sofia Soley, 15-13, 6-15, 11-10. Martinez went to her second World Championships in 2014 in Burlington, Ontario, Canada, where she played both singles and doubles. In Women's Singles, she defeated Argentina's V√©ronique Guillemette, 15-9, 10-15, 11-6, in the Round of 32, but then lost to Maria Jose Vargas of Argentina, 15-5, 15-5. In Women's Doubles, she and Maria Renee Rodriguez lost to Mexicans Paola Longoria and Samantha Salas, 15-6, 15-4, in the Round of 16. At the 2014 Junior World Championships in Cali, Colombia, Martinez again won Girl's U14 by defeating over Wanda Carvajal of Bolivia in the final, 15-2, 15-9. Also in Cali, she and Rodriguez were 2nd in U18 Doubles, as they lost to Mexicans Alexandra Herrera and Ximena Gonzalez, 15-9, 7-15, 11-2. Martinez reached the podium at an international event for the first time at the 2014 Central American and Caribbean Games in Veracruz, Mexico, where she was a triple medalist. Martinez was a silver medalist in both Women's Doubles (with Maria Renee Rodriguez) and the Women's Team event as well as a bronze medalist in Women's Singles, as she lost to Paola Longoria of Mexico in the semi-finals, 15-5, 15-9. In the Women's Doubles final, Martinez and Rodriguez lost to Mexicans Longoria and Samantha Salas, 15-4, 15-2. At the 2015 Pan American Championships in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, Martinez lost in Women's Singles to the Dominican Republic's Maria Cespedes, 7-15, 15-12, 11-9.

Martinez attended her first Pan American Games in Toronto in 2015, when she played Women's Singles, Women's Doubles and in the Women's Team event. In singles, she lost in the Round of 16 to Mexican Paola Longoria, 15-3, 15-6, and in doubles, Martinez and Rodriguez lost to Bolivians Carola Loma and Natalia Mendez in the Round of 16, 10-15, 15-11, 11-5. She helped put a scare into the host Canadian team in the first round of the Women's Team event, as she upset Fr√©d√©rique Lambert in their singles match, and then went to a tie-breaker in the deciding doubles match before Canadians Lambert and Jennifer Saunders were able to pull out the victory.  2016 to present - Breakthrough  In 2016, Martinez picked up her first medal at the Pan American Racquetball Championships, as she reached the semi-finals by defeating Michelle Key of the USA in the quarterfinals, 15-7, 10-15, 11-7. In the semis, Martinez lost to Canadian Fr√©d√©rique Lambert, 15-9, 14-15, 11-5, resulting in a bronze medal. This was just the second podium result for Martinez. At a couple weeks short of her 17th birthday and with just two podium finishes, little was expected of Martinez coming into the 2016 World Championships in Cali, Colombia. However, she exceeded whatever expectations people had by reaching the finals in Women's Singles. To get there, Martinez defeated former 2-time World Champion Rhonda Rajsich of the USA in the Round of 16, 15-14, 14-15, 11-7, then beat Ecauador's Veronica Sotomayor, 15-9, 15-9, in the quarterfinals, and Mexico's Samantha Salas, 15-11, 14-15, 11-9, in the semi-finals, before falling to 2-time defending champion Paola Longoria of Mexico, 15-12, 15-5. It was Martinez's greatest achievement up to then by far. She also played Women's Doubles at Worlds in Cali, where she and Maria Renee Rodriguez defeated Colombians Cristina Amaya and Caroline Gomez in the Round of 16, 13-15, 15-13, 11-8, and then lost to Mexicans Longoria and Salas, 15-2, 15-5, in the quarterfinals. In 2016, Martinez was again a World Junior Champion, as she won Girls U16 at the World Junior Championships in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, by defeating Mexican Monserrat Mejia in final, 15-13, 15-7. She also won Girls U18 Doubles with Andrea Martinez, her older sister. Martinez earned two bronze medals at the 2017 Pan American Championships in San Jos√©, Costa Rica. In Women's Singles, she got to the semi-finals by defeating Chile's Carla Mu√±oz, 15-4, 15-8, in the quarterfinals. In the semis, Martinez lost to Paola Longoria of Mexico, 15-7, 15-11. In doubles, Martinez and Andrea Martinez got bronze, as they defeated Canadians Danielle Drury and Jennifer Saunders, 15-7, 15-13, in the Round of 16, Argentina's V√©ronique Guillemette and Natalia Mendez in the quarterfinals, 15-6, 15-9, before losing to Maria Paz Mu√±oz and Veronica Sotomayor of Ecuador, 10-15, 15-5, 11-4, in the semi-finals. Martinez had her 1st semi-final appearance on the Ladies Professional Racquetball Tour in August, 2017 in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, as she reached the semi-finals with wins over Cristina Amaya in the Round of 16, and Rhonda Rajsich in the quarterfinals. She lost in the semis to Paola Longoria, 11-7, 11-5, 11-9. She hadn't been further than the Round of 16 previously. Perhaps that performance in San Luis Potosi spurred Longoria to partner with Martinez to play LPRT Doubles at the 2017 US Open, and they won the title by defeating Cristina Amaya and Adriana Riveros in the final, 15-5, 15-8. Martinez lost for the first time since 2010 at the World Junior Championships in 2017 in Minneapolis, as Mexican Monserrat Mejia beat her in the final of Girls U18 Singles, 15-13, 4-15, 11-5. Martinez competed in the 2017 Bolivarian Games in Santa Marta, Colombia, where she was a silver medalist in Women's Singles and the Women's Team events, and a quarterfinalist in Women's Singles. In singles, she lost to Cristina Amaya, 15-8, 15-10. In doubles, Martinez and Maria Renee Rodriguez lost to Bolivians Stefanny Barrios and Jenny Daza, 15-14, 4-15, 11-9. Martinez and Rodriguez were silver medalists in Women's Doubles at the 2018 Pan American Championships in Temuco, Chile, where they lost in the final to Mexicans Paola Longoria and Alexandra Herrera, 9-15, 15-1, 11-8. Martinez also earned a bronze medal in Women's Singles in Temuco, as she beat Argentina's Natalia Mendez, 15-12, 10-15, 11-2, in the quarterfinals, and then lost to eventual champion Rhonda Rajsich of the USA, 15-13, 15-10. She was also a multiple medalist at the 2018 Central American & Caribbean Games in Barranquilla, Colombia. In Women's Singles, Martinez defeated Mexico's Alexandra Herrera in the semi-finals, 15-2, 0-15, 11-7, and then lost the finals to Herrera's team-mate Paola Longoria, 15-13, 15-7. In Women's Doubles, Martinez and Rodriguez beat Colombians Cristina Amaya and Adriana Riveros in the semi-finals, 15-12, 12-15, 11-4, and then went breaker with Mexicans Longoria and Samantha Salas, but lost, 9-15, 15-9, 11-5. In the Women's Team event, Martinez and Rodriguez lost to Colombia, 2-1, in the semi-finals. Martinez won her match against Riveros, but they lost the doubles to Riveros and Amaya and Amaya defeated Rodriguez in the deciding match. Thus, Martinez went home from Barranquilla with two silver medals and a bronze. Martinez won the Women's Singles World Championship at the World Championships. Seeded 6th in the medal round, Martinez beat Canadian veteran Jennifer Saunders, 15-2, 15-5, in the Round of 16, Mexican Samantha Salas, 15-4, 15-12, in the quarterfinals, and Argentina's Natalia Mendez, 15-8, 15-3, in the semi-finals, to set up a rematch of the 2016 final with 3-time defending champion Paola Longoria of Mexico. In the final, Martinez came back from a game down to upset Longoria and win in three games, 8-15, 15-6, 11-6, claiming her first gold medal in international competition. Martinez, at 19, became the youngest woman to be World Champion passing Canadian Christie Van Hees, who was 21 when she won in 1998. In Women's Doubles at Worlds, Martinez and Rodriguez lost in the semi-finals to Bolivians Valeria Centellas and Yasmine Sabja, when Martinez picked up an injury in the second game of the match. They finished that game but then defaulted in the tie-breaker. So, Martinez was a double medalist at Worlds for the first time: gold in singles and bronze in doubles. 2018 continued to be a great year for Martinez, as she reached the semi-finals of the US Open Racquetball Championships - racquetball's premier pro event - for the first time. She defeated Alexandra Herrera in the quarterfinals, 11-6, 11-8, 6-11, 11-9, to set up a rematch of the 2018 Worlds final with Paola Longoria. This time Longoria won in three straight games, 11-5, 11-0, 11-3. With that success, Martinez was expected to win Girls U18 at the World Junior Championships in San Luis Potosi, Mexico in what was her last year of junior eligibility. However, for the 2nd consecutive year she lost in the final to Mexico's Montserrat Mejia, 15-14, 8-15, 11-6. Thus, Martinez finished 2018 as World Champion, but not World Junior Champion. Martinez wasn't at the 2019 Pan American Championships, but she was on the Guatemalan team for the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima, Peru. In Women's Singles she lost in the Round of 16 to Natalia Mendez of Argentina, 15-10, 12-15, 11-6. But in Women's Doubles, she and Maria Renee Rodriguez got silver, as they reached the final with a wins over Colombians Cristina Amaya and Adriana Riveros, 12-15, 15-11, 11-8, in the quarterfinals, and Argentina's Natalia Mendez and Maria Jose Vargas, 15-9, 10-15, 11-1, but then lost to Mexicans Paola Longoria and Samantha Salas in three games, 15-5, 11-15, 11-5. In the Women's Team event, she and Rodriguez lost to Bolivia in the quarterfinals. Career summary Martinez has represented Guatemala 15 times, winning 17 medals, highlighted by gold in Women's Singles at the 2018 World Championships.

This cultivar is extensively grown in New Mexico where it was developed and is popular in New Mexican cuisine. Big Jim peppers are both sweet and mild and are normally picked while still green. The fruits are large and thick walled, often exceeding over a foot in length, and they are almost exclusively used to produce roasted green chili in New Mexican cuisine. History The Big Jim pepper cultivar was developed at New Mexico State University by Dr. Roy Nakayama, a son of Japanese immigrants and a man who had once been denied entry into NMSU because of his ethnicity. The Big Jim is a hybrid of New Mexican chilies and a Peruvian pepper that was developed at New Mexico State University by Dr. Nakayama in 1975 in cooperation with Jim Lytle, the person for whom this chili pepper is named. The Big Jim chili holds the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest chili pepper in the world, with individual fruits routinely exceeding 14 inches in length. The peppers are mild when still green, but become more spicy as they ripen to red. They are rarely used as in their ripe form, and are almost exclusively used to produce green chili. In common with most New Mexico chili cultivars, Big Jim chilies are somewhat variable in their fruiting, and produce individual peppers of varying heat, with most of the peppers being very mild (500 SHU), and an occasional medium pepper (3,000 SHU).

Left to right: Lincoln Building, Springler Building, 15 Union Square West. The Spingler Building (also Springler Building or 5 Union Square West) is an eight-story Romanesque building at 5‚Äì9 Union Square West, between 14th and 15th Streets, in the Union Square neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. Built in 1897 by William H. Hume & Son, it replaced a five-story building of the same name, which burned down in 1892. The Spingler Building occupies an L-shaped lot wrapping around 15 Union Square West to the north, and is also adjacent to the Lincoln Building to the south.  History  = Site and previous structures = The site of the Spingler Building was initially part of a farm owned by Henry Spingler (or Springler). Union Square was first laid out in the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, expanded in 1832, and then made into a public park in 1839. The completion of the park led to the construction of mansions surrounding it, which were largely replaced with commercial enterprises following the American Civil War. Despite this, the Spingler and Van Buren families continued to own the land under the western side of Union Square until 1958, leasing it out to various people. The Spingler Institute for Young Ladies, founded in 1843, was located at 5 Union Square West from 1848 until , at which point it was turned into the Spingler Hotel. The hotel operated from 1864 until about 1878. Stereoscopic view of Spingler House By the late 1870s, technological advances in elevator technology and steel framework enabled the construction of taller office buildings. The original Spingler Building, a five-story loft and commercial structure on the site of the hotel, was completed in 1878 at a cost of $115,000. The Spingler Building was a \\"L\\"-shaped structure wrapping around the Tiffany & Co. building at 15 Union Square West to the northeast, with a depth of on Union Square West, along its eastern facade, and on 15th Street to the north. The structure housed the Brentano's book store. At the time, The New York Times said: \\"the block is now occupied by uniform buildings [...] the front is of iron, imposing in appearance, and the shops and lofts are of the first class.\\" In 1892, the structure burned down in a fire that destroyed everything below the second floor, but only caused minor damage to its neighbors: the Lincoln Building (to the south) and 15 Union Square West. The charred walls of the old building remained standing for several years. = Modern building = On July 17, 1895, James L. Libby & Son leased 5‚Äì9 Union Square West as well as the adjacent 20 East 15th Street. The \\"L\\"-shaped building site covered about and was roughly the same as the old building footprint. On this site, Libby & Son planned to build an eight-story limestone, brick, and terracotta building. The structure was to be designed by William H. Hume & Son. Land clearing began four days afterward, at which point The New York Times reported that the structure would be completed by May 1896. However, the new Spingler Building was not completed until sometime before March 1897, when Libby & Son ran advertisements in the New-York Tribune stating that the building had the \\"finest stores and lightest lofts in the city\\". The Spingler Building was designed for multiple uses, including \\"stores, showrooms, manufacturing enterprises and industrial lofts,\\" and catered in particular to Union Square's growing garment trade. Among the Spingler Building's first tenants were hatters Cluett, Coon & Co. who were reported to have moved into the building in an August 1897 issue of American Hatter magazine. In 1901, some of the upper-level space was leased to Mark Aronson, whose company manufactured cloaks and suits.Miller, Tom (December 28, 2013). \\"Daytonian in Manhattan: The 1897 Spingler Building ‚Äì Nos 5-9 Union Square West\\". Daytonian in Manhattan. This was followed in 1906 by Henry Hart of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, though Hart seems to have moved out the following year. One of the ground-floor stores was occupied in 1910 by the Cleveland Faucet Company. Besides Aronson's firm, other garment companies seem to have occupied the Spingler Building in the early 20th century, including the London Button Company.See, for instance,  In the 1970s nylon strings guitars were also sold there , I have one , they were guitars made in Finland and sold at 5 Union Square as imports , Alfred Roldan NYC In the late 1990s, the supply store chain Staples announced that it would open a location on Union Square West between 14th and 15th Streets, within of space across two floors. The store opened in February 1997 within the Spingler Building at 5‚Äì9 Union Square West, where it is still located. Just before the store's opening, a particular point of contention was the presence of several large signs, including a lighted sign with letters; four vertical signs on the facade; and a bright red background behind some of the store windows. The Union Square Business Improvement District had requested that Staples reduce the size of these signs in January 1997, saying that the signs might be visually distracting. The New York City Department of Buildings had approved and then revoked the signs' permits, but even after the permit was rescinded, Staples erected the signs anyway, The dispute resulted in Staples being issued a summons for the New York City Criminal Court, and by the end of the year, the signs had been dismantled.  Description  The Spingler Building is designed in the Romanesque style with classical influences. Its facade was designed with base, shaft, and capital sections, similar to the components of a column. The facade of the two-story base is of limestone; the five-story shaft is made of brick with terracotta detailing; and the one-story capital is made of terracotta.

Oh Shit!'s level and art design is identical to that of Pac-Man. Oh Shit! was later released in 1985 for the MSX to a wider market, and was republished with differing names and cover art several times; Oh Shit! was renamed to Oh No! for the game's UK release due to the name being considered 'too obscene', and the name was shortened to Shit! for its release by Premium III Software Distribution. The European re-release Shit! notably uses cover art from 1985 horror novel The Howling III: Echoes, possibly without permission. Oh Shit! features digitized speech; when the player loses a life, the eponymous phrase \\"Oh Shit!\\" is said. For the renamed releases, Oh No! and Shit!, the speech is changed accordingly. Releases The original Spectrum release and 1985 MSX release were published by Aackosoft, but later releases of the MSX version were published by different publishers; the European version of Oh Shit! was later published by Eaglesoft (an alternate label of Aackosoft), and Oh Shit! was published by Compulogical in Spain.Oh Shit! was noted by many reviewers to be very visually similar to Pac-Man. The UK release, Oh No!, was also published by Eaglesoft. The European re-release, Shit!, was developed by Eurosoft and published by Premium III Software Distribution, notably using cover art from 1985 horror novel The Howling III: Echoes, possibly without permission. The original MSX version of Oh Shit! was made for compatibility with MSX 32K computers, and later re-releases offer MSX 64K compatibility. Unlike other Aackosoft titles in the Classics range, Oh Shit! is incompatible with MSX 16K computers. Aackosoft went bankrupt in 1988, after which Shit!, alongside other Aackosoft titles, were re-published by Premium III Software Distribution and developed by Eurosoft (a former label of Aackosoft) in the same year. Premium III Software Distribution released the 30 MSX Hits compilation in 1988, including Oh Shit! as part of its lineup. According to Dutch gaming magazine MSX-DOS Computer Magazine, after Aackosoft went bankrupt in 1988, their intellectual property was transferred to a company called Methodic Solutions, and all previous MSX Aackosoft titles were re-published by Premium III Software Distribution and developed by Eurosoft, both separately and in a compilation titled 30 MSX Hits. The 1988 30 MSX Hits compilation release of Oh Shit! offers MSX2 compatibility. All MSX releases of Oh Shit!, Shit! and Oh No! are cassette releases, except for the 30 MSX Hits release, which had both cassette and floppy disk releases. =Version Differences= Oh Shit! introduces the game's ghosts on the title screen using digitized speech stating \\"This is Joey, Paul, Willy and Frankie\\", however the UK version Oh No! says \\"This is Joey, this is Paul, this is Willy, this is Frankie\\". \\"This is\\" has the same enunciation all four times it is said. Unlike Oh Shit!, where \\"Oh Shit!\\" is said every time the player dies, in Oh No!, \\"Oh No!\\" is only said after the player has lost all their lives and gets a game over.Oh No! (1986), MSX. The ByteBusters. Eaglesoft. Gameplay Oh Shit!'s gameplay is identical to that of Pac-Man, down to the level design. This was noted as a positive by reviewers who deemed it a faithful reproduction of the arcade original. The ghosts in Oh Shit! are named Joey, Paul, Willy, and Frankie.

MSX Computing states in their review that they received two copies of the game for their review, both the UK Oh No! version and the European Oh Shit! version, stating that the European version's name was \\"deigned unsuitable for the UK\\". The MSX UK Oh No! version cost ¬£2.99 in 1986. The MSX version of Oh Shit! originally cost ∆í29.50 Dutch Guilder in 1985, and was reduced to ∆í14.95 in 1987. In 1988, the cassette release of 30 MSX Hits was ∆í49.90, and the floppy disk release was ∆í79.90. Reception Oh Shit! was generally positively received by reviewers, who considered it to be a faithful reproduction of Pac-Man, and several reviewers praised the addition of digitized speech. Oh Shit! was predominantly reviewed in Dutch gaming magazines, as Oh Shit! was developed & originally published in the Netherlands. Dutch gaming magazine MSX Gids gave the MSX version of Oh Shit! an overall score of 4.5 out of five, rating graphics, game quality, and price five stars, but giving sound three stars. MSX Gids criticises Oh Shit!'s sound effects, stating that \\"The speech, which gets boring quickly, has been added at the expense of the original wokka-wokka sounds. Too bad.\\" Dutch gaming magazine MSX Computer Magazine reviewed the MSX version of Oh Shit! alongside other Aackosoft titles based upon arcade titles, Boom (Galaxian), Scentipede (Centipede), and Hopper (Frogger). MSX Computer Magazine praises Oh Shit!'s gameplay, calling Oh Shit! a \\"perfect reproduction of the original arcade game\\", and praising the inclusion of the 'coffee break' cutscenes from the original Pac-Man that play as intermissions between levels. MSX Computer Magazine further notes Oh Shit!'s similarity to Pac-Man, stating that the levels are \\"identical to the arcade original\\", but expresses that Oh Shit! differentiates itself through the addition of speech. MSX Computer Magazine criticises Oh Shit!'s incompatibility with MSX 16Ks. MSX Computer Magazine, now named MSX-DOS Computer Magazine, reviewed the MSX version of Shit! alongside other arcade clones, particularly comparing it to another Pac-Man clone, Maze Master, stating that they prefer the original Pac-Man or Shit! over Maze Master. MSX-DOS expresses that they mourned Aackosoft's bankruptcy, stating that \\"Shit! used to be a favorite of mine, Pac-Man fan that I am, and with the loss of Aackosoft a good program was withdrawn from rotation\\", praising the game's re-publishing by Premium III Software. MSX-DOS criticises the shortening of the game's speech of \\"Oh Shit!\\" to just \\"Shit!\\", but still expresses that \\"Despite that, Shit! still always remains a sublime Pac-Man, too bad about the change of voice acting.\\" MSX-DOS Computer Magazine reviewed the MSX version of Oh Shit! in 1988 as part of the compilation release 30 MSX Hits, expressing that \\"Oh Shit! is a good Pac-Man-clone with a great name\\". MSX-DOS Computer Magazine notes 30 MSX Hits' MSX2 compatibility, further expressing that not all MSX games offer this compatibility, stating \\"So you thought that any MSX program could be used on any MSX computer? As long as you don't try MSX2 software on MSX1 hardware? Well, everyone thought that, in the past. Before the MSX standard was well defined, game programmers sometimes did not adhere to that standard. There has been a lot of trouble with non-running games in the past.\\" Oh Shit!'s MSX2 compatibility was also noted by MSX Club Magazine in their review of 30 MSX Hits in 1988. British gaming magazine MSX Computing gave the UK MSX version, Oh No!, an overall score of two out of three stars, noting its similarity to Pac-Man, stating that \\"Pac-man fans will love this game as it is based very much along the same lines.\\" MSX Computing praises Oh No!'s digitized speech, expressing that \\"The speech is a really novel and fun feature and does much to enhance the game\\" and further noting Oh No! as \\"far superior\\" to similar games due to its speech capability. MSX Computing praises Oh No!'s gameplay, calling it \\"addictive\\" and \\"an easy game to play\\", further recommending it due to its low price of ¬£2.99 in 1986. Dutch gaming magazine MSX Club Magazine reviewed the MSX version of Oh Shit! in 1986, giving it an overall score of 9/10, beginning their description of Oh Shit!'s gameplay by stating \\"You already know how to play it: it's Pac-Man.\\" MSX Club called Oh Shit!'s graphics \\"not graphically amazing, but this doesn't hinder gameplay\\", and criticised Oh Shit!'s sound effects, stating that \\"Beyond the typical irritating Pac-Man sounds there's also speech present\\", and calls the death message of \\"Oh Shit!\\" \\"terrible shouting\\". MSX Club notes a difficulty curve in Oh Shit! as the game progresses, and praises the addition of cutscenes.

Racing career =2016: two- year-old season= On 11 September at Hanshin Racecourse Suave Richard began his racing career by finishing second to Meliora in a 2000 metres contest for previously unraced juveniles. Three weeks later he recorded his first victory when he won a maiden race over the same course and distance. On 19 November he was stepped up in class for the Grade 3 Tokyo Sports Hai Nisai Stakes over 1800 metres at Tokyo Racecourse when he started at odds of 7.1/1 and finished second, beaten a neck by Bless Journey. In the official Japanese rankings for 2016, Suave Richard was rated the fifth-best two-year-old colt, four pounds behind the top-rated Satono Ares. =2017: three-year-old season= Suave Richard's trainer Yasushi Shono Suave Richard made his three-year-old debut in the Tokinominoru Kinen (a trial race for the Satsuki Sho) over 1800 metres at Tokyo on 12 February and started the 2.1/1 second favourite. Ridden by Hirofumi Shii he settled behind the leaders before staying on in the straight, taking the lead in the last 200 metres and drawing away to win by two and a half lengths from Etre Digne. In the 77th running of the Satsuki Sho at Nakayama Racecourse on 26 April he started second choice in the betting but although he finished strongly he was never able to reach the leaders and came home sixth behind Al Ain. He was then moved up in distance for the Tokyo Yushun over 2400 metres at Tokyo on 26 May in which he again made good late progress but failed by three-quarters of a length to reel in the winner Rey de Oro. After a break of over five months, Suave Richard returned in the Grade 2 Copa Republica Argentina over 2500 metres at Tokyo, a race in which he was matched against older horses for the first time and ridden by Mirco Demuro, who became his regular jockey. After racing in mid division he moved up on the inside entering the straight, gained the advantage 300 metres out and quickly broke clear of the field to win by two and a half lengths from the five-year- old Sole Impact. On his final run of the season the colt contested the Arima Kinen at Nakayama on 24 December and came home fourth of the sixteen runners behind Kitasan Black, Queens Ring and Cheval Grand. In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Suave Richard was given a rating of 118, making him rated the 90th best horse in the world and the seventh-best horse in Japan. =2018: four-year-old season= Mirco Demuro who rode Suave Richard in 2018 On his first run as a four-year-old Suave Richard started odds-on favourite for the Grade 2 Kinko Sho at Chukyo Racecourse over 2000 metres on 11 March. After tracking the front-running outsider Satono Noblesse for most of the way he took the lead in the closing stages and won by half a length, with Satono Diamond a length away in third place. Three weeks later the colt contested the Grade 1 Osaka Hai over the same distance at Hanshin and went off the 2.5/1 favourite in a sixteen-runner field which also included Al Ain, Satono Diamond, Cheval Grand and the Mile Championship winner Persian Knight. Suave Richard raced towards the rear in the early stages before rushing up on the outside to dispute the lead in the straight. He gained a clear advantage early in the straight and \\"romped to a convincing victory\\", holding off the late charge of Persian Knight by three quarters of a length. Mirco Demuro commented \\"Since the pace was very slow, I decided to make an early bid. He responded so well, I had absolutely no doubts in him and he stretched beautifully\\". In June the colt was dropped back in distance for the Yasuda Kinen over 1600 metres and started favourite, but after challenging for the lead in the straight he was outpaced in the final strides and came home third behind Mozu Ascot and Aerolithe, beaten a neck and three quarters of a length. Returning from a lengthy summer break, Suave Richard was made favourite for the autumn edition of the Tenno Sho at Tokyo on 28 October. but after being badly hampered shortly after the start he was never in serious contention and finished tenth behind Rey de Oro. The colt ended his season in the Japan Cup at Tokyo on 25 November in which he started the 5.5/1 second favourite and finished third behind Almond Eye and the front-running Kiseki. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Suave Richard's rating of 121 made him the thirty first best racehorse in world. =2019: five-year-old season= Suave Richard began his fourth campaign in the Nakayama Kinen over 1800 metres on 24 February when he stayed on well without being able to reach the leaders and came home fourth behind Win Bright, Lucky Lilac and Stelvio. Rather than attempt a repeat victory in the Osaka Hai, the horse was sent to the United Arab Emirates to contest the Dubai Sheema Classic at Meydan Racecourse on 30 March. Ridden by Jo√£o Moreira he was restrained at the rear of the field before finishing strongly to take third place behind Old Persian and Cheval Grand. On his return to Japan he went off the 7.8/1 sixth choice in the betting for the Takarazuka Kinen over 2200 metres on 23 June at Hanshin. He finished third behind Lys Gracieux and Kiseki after racing on the wide outside for most of the way before keeping on well in the straight. Suave Richard wins the Japan Cup On his return in autumn Suave Richard was partnered by Norihiro Yokoyama when he made his second bid for the Tenno Sho. He raced in mid-division before making some progress in the straight but never looked likely to win and came home seventh behind Almond Eye, beaten five and a half lengths by the winner. On 24 November Suave Richard was one of fifteen horses to contest the 39th running of the Japan Cup and started the 4.1/1 third choice in the betting behind Rey de Oro and Wagnerian. The other contenders included Makahiki and Cheval Grand in a field which, for the first time, contained no overseas challengers. Ridden by Oisin Murphy he raced in mid-division he made a forward move on the inside entering the straight, gained the advantage 200 metres from the finish and held off the challenge of the three-year-old filly Curren Bouquetd'Or to win by three quarters of a length. Commenting on his decision to launch his final challenge along the inside rail Murphy said \\"I had the option of forcing Curren Bouquetd'or out. I could have done that. He's a big enough horse. But that would have taken too much energy, so I took the shortest way... I knew for the last 200 meters that Suave Richard would win\\" while Yasushi Shono said \\"both the horse and the jockey had a lot of courage\\". Suave Richard ended his season on 22 December with a second attempt to win the Arima Kinen. He started at odds of 16.5/1 and was never in serious contention before finishing twelfth of the sixteen runners behind Lys Gracieux. In January 2020, at the JRA Awards for 2019, Suave Richard finished third to Win Bright and Indy Champ in the poll to determine Best Older Male Horse. In the 2019 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Suave Richard was given a rating of 121, making him the 29th best racehorse in the world.

Life Born in Tehran, Mahallati initially studied economics at the National University of Iran and civil engineering at the University of Kansas in the US. Later, he obtained a master's in political economy from the University of Oregon and earned his PhD in Islamic studies from McGill University in Canada. Serving as the chair of the department of economics in Kerman University for a year, Mahallati became a diplomat and spent a decade working with the United Nations. He played a major role in adopting the Security Council Resolution 598 which brought the Iran-Iraq war to an end. Returning to his academic career, Mahallati taught at various institutions including Columbia, Princeton, Yale, and Georgetown. In 2007, he joined the Oberlin College and is still serving as the Presidential Scholar in Islamic Studies and the Nancy Schrom Dye Chair in Middle East and North African Studies.  Accusation  On the 7th of October 2020, a group of former Iranian political prisoners and human rights activists sent a letter to the president of Oberlin College demanding that the college's management terminate Dr. Mohammad Jafar Mahallati's employment following accusations he played a role in the cover-up of the 1988 massacre of political prisoners in Iran. Mahallati served as the Director General of International Affairs for the Iranian Foreign Ministry from 1982 to 1987 and Charg√© d'Affaires and the Ambassador of Iran to the United Nations from 1987-1989. On 10 October Dr. Mahallati wrote in a statement \\"The accusers fail to provide a single solid document as evidence of my actual knowledge of these incidents. With no concrete evidence, they infer that I must have been informed of and intentionally denied these atrocities. I categorically deny any knowledge and therefore responsibility regarding mass executions in Iran when I was serving at the United Nations.\\" However, on 16 August 1988 Amnesty International sent a letter of \\"Urgent Action to the Chief Justice and Minister of Justice of Iran, expressing concern with evidence that a new wave of political executions were taking place in Iran of which copies were sent to the diplomatic representatives of Iran around the world . On 2 September 1988, Amnesty International once again sent a letter of Urgent Action to the same authorities and Iranian diplomatic representatives, condemning the political executions in Iran in August, which were reportedly continuing. Between August and December 1988, Amnesty International sent 14 letters of Urgent Action to the Iranian authorities and diplomatic representatives requesting that the mass executions of political prisoners be stopped On 13 October 1988 at the UN general assembly, Prof.Qalindo Pohl Special Representative of the Commission on Human Rights in Iran presented his report about human right violations and executions in Iran. According to the UN report, on the 20 November 1988, the Special Representative had a long discussion with the Ambassador Mahallati and a second meeting took place on 29 November, at which the Ambassador Mahallati referred to the alleged wave of executions mentioned in the interim report of Prof. Qalindo Pohl and denied the allegations. On the 8 December 1988, while Mr Mahallati was the Ambassador, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on the situation of human rights in Iran, which expressed grave concern about a renewed wave of executions in Iran in July-September 1988 targeting prisoners for their political convictions.

Over time it has been attributed to various artists, particularly Duccio di Buoninsegna due to its similarities with his Crevole Madonna or Cimabue or a collaboration between the two. After a 1930-1931 restoration by Giorgina Lucarini it was more precisely attributed to Cimabue by most art historians, including Miklos Boskovitz and Luciano Bellosi, the two main experts on medieval Tuscan art, drawing on Duccio's slightly earlier Crevole Madonna.

Originally known for Antarctic krill oil production, the company now operates an industrial-scale licensed cannabis processing plant in Quebec, CA, and a hemp processing facility in North Carolina in the U.S.  History  = Krill Oil Production = Neptune Wellness Solutions (originally Neptune Technologies and Bioresources) was founded by Henri Harland and Luc Rainville in 1998. The Canadian biotech company conducted some of the first research on the health benefits of krill oil and the unique, absorption capacity of its ‚Äúphospholipid‚Äù molecular structure and the fats contained within it. Neptune secured a family of patents - for an extraction process as well as composition and method of use. In 2002, the company pioneered the production and extraction of Antarctic krill oil. In 2003, after constructing a new facility in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Neptune launched its first product, Neptune Krill Oil, creating a new omega-3 category, manufactured using acetone as a solvent. In 2012, an explosion in Neptune‚Äôs processing plant resulted in three deaths and halted production at the facility. Following the accident, the company spent two years rebuilding the plant and was required to meet several safety conditions before resuming production in 2014. In 2017, Neptune essentially exited the bulk krill oil manufacturing and distribution business, selling its client list to its main competitor, Aker BioMarine of Oslo, Norway, for $34 million. The company invested the proceeds of the sale toward the $70 million conversion project of its Sherbrooke facility to process cannabis biomass using new cold-ethanol technology and rebranded to Neptune Wellness Solutions. = Cannabis / Hemp Production = Neptune was licensed by Health Canada in January 2019 to enter the cannabis market, allowing the company to manufacture and purify cannabis extracts and oil. After receiving the license, the company entered into a three-year contract with Canadian companies The Green Organic Dutchman and Tilray, securing cannabis and hemp biomass for extraction of crude resin, winterized oil, and distillate extracts for their products. In May 2019, Neptune entered the U.S. hemp market by acquiring the assets of SugarLeaf Labs and Forest Remedies. The purchase included a 24,000-square-foot cold-ethanol hemp processing facility, located in Conover, NC. The company replaced CEO Jim Hamilton with Michael Cammarata the former CEO of Schmidt's Naturals. In July 2019, Cammarata helped Neptune raise 41 million through a private stock placement.  Products  = Krill Oil = Made from Antarctic krill, a sustainable and non-genetically-modified source of omega-3 fatty acids, Neptune‚Äôs krill-based supplements are available to consumers in the U.S. and Canada for direct purchase or through its distributors. = Hemp Oil = Neptune produces hemp-derived products exclusively from U.S. grown hemp. The company is involved in all aspects of product production, including farmer collaboration during the growth cycle to processing, formulating, testing, packaging and distributing finished products to customers.

It was first performed on 4 March 1707 at Drury Lane. Development Addison and Clayton both objected to the new practice of having parts of operas performed in London sung in Italian; they felt that the texts used should be examples of the finest literary English. Addison however followed the norm of Italian opera by having three male and three female characters. In 1705 Clayton had enjoyed considerable success with his opera Arsinoe, Queen of Cyprus which had run for twenty-four nights in its first season, as well as eleven nights the following year. There were three further performances in 1707, but by that time Antonio Maria Bononcini‚Äôs Camilla had appeared on the stage, and the public appetite for a better musical experience had moved on. The cast of Rosamond was Francis Hughes (King Henry), Catherine Tofts (Queen Elinor), Richard Leveridge (Sir Trusty), Miss Gallia (Rosamond) and Miss Lindsey (Grideline). This was the same cast as had performed Arsinoe, suggesting that Addison was seeking to introduce his English libretto to a company of singers who had already shown they could achieve great success. Action The action is drawn from the poem The Death of Rosamond by Thomas May. It concerns the story of Rosamond Clifford, mistress of Henry II of England. A jealous Queen Elinor poisons her but she recovers, and Henry repents of his sin. While Queen Elinor regains her husband‚Äôs love by appealing to his sense of destiny, a comic subplot involves Sir Trusty and his wife Grideline, and the interplay between the two is similar to the ‚Äòsplit-plot‚Äô plays of John Dryden. The opera emphasised the importance of unity and Britishness, contrasting the gentle character of Rosamond with the vengeful French queen. It was accompanied by a prologue that compared Marlborough to Henry II, and at the climax of the story the sleeping Henry sees a vision of the future of the spot where he is resting and a huge plan of Blenheim Palace is unfurled on stage. The opera seemed full of absurdities, for example when King Henry approaches the bower where he meets Rosamond, there is a fanfare of instruments and the verse proclaims: ‚ÄòHark, hark! What sound invades me ear? The conqueror‚Äôs approach I hear.‚Äô Rosamond herself dies in the second act and this loss is ‚Äònot compensated by a single interesting event in the third.‚Äô Critical reception The production was a disaster and the opera closed after just three nights. Clayton‚Äôs music was described as ‚Äòa jargon of sounds.‚Äô Roger Fisk described it as ‚Äòcretinous.‚Äô Charles Burney said that Addison ‚Äònever manifested a greater want of taste and intelligence in music than when he employed Clayton to set his opera of Rosamond.‚Äù In 1837 John Barnett created another opera on the same theme, Fair Rosamond, and The Spectator reminded its readers that Clayton‚Äôs Rosamond had been ‚Äòan utter failure‚Äô that ‚Äòhad the effect of paralysing every effort to perpetuate or revive the fading glory of English dramatic music. Clayton‚Äôs Rosamond was the funeral dirge of the English opera.‚Äô Addison never wrote another libretto. Clayton wrote music for a work called 'The Passion of Sappho, and Feast of Alexander‚Äô that was performed at his house in York Buildings, but he appears never to have written again for a professional production. Legacy The score was published in 1707 by John Walsh and P. Randall. The libretto was published by Jacob Tonson in the same year. After the failure of Rosamund there were no further attempts to write a libretto in English until 1733, when Addison‚Äôs libretto was set to new music by Thomas Arne.

Today it is a National monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina.Sinagoga u Zenici  History  While the history of the Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina dates back to the Expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, Jews did not settle in Zenica until 1750. Most of these early settlers were Sephardic Jews. They were joined in 1878 by Ashkenazi Jews from Austria- Hungary. By 1885, the community had built a synagogue next to the local bazaar and a Jewish cemetery outside of the city. The current synagogue building was built between 1904 and 1907. In 1910 the Jewish community in Zenica was 297, with about 200 living in the city on the eve of the Invasion of Yugoslavia. 185 members of the Zenica Jewish community were killed in the Holocaust, and those who returned to their homes after the war were unable to rebuild the demolished synagogue building themselves, so the building took on other roles. Zenica Ironworks used the building to house their printing house, and in the 1960s the building housed a furniture store. In 1968 the Jewish Community of Yugoslavia reached an agreement with the city to turn the building into a local museum.  Description  The building of the Zenica Synagogue was based on Neo-Moorish Architecture and measured 10.2x18.5 m.

It was developed by German company Magic Bytes and published by Gremlin Graphics. It was released in Europe for Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum. Pink Panther was criticized for its control and difficulty, although the Amiga and Atari ST versions received praise for their graphics. Gameplay The Pink Panther wants to take a vacation on an island, but he lacks the funds to do so. To raise the necessary money he takes a job as a butler so he can rob the wealthy homeowners of their belongings while they sleep. The game takes place across several mansions, played one at a time. Playing as the Pink Panther, the player must purchase the items necessary to qualify for each butler job. Such requirements include a top hat for the first mansion, and a car for one of the later mansions. In each mansion, the homeowner turns out to be a sleepwalker. The player must rob belongings around the house while simultaneously preventing the homeowner from bumping into obstacles, which will wake up the owner and foil the Pink Panther's theft. In each mansion, the player has a side view of the home with several floors visible on the screen. The player must also avoid Inspector Clouseau, who looks for the Pink Panther in each mansion. The player has various items that can be used to avoid Clouseau and also prevent the sleepwalking homeowner from waking up. Items such as catapults and springboards can be used to help the homeowner get across obstacles, and a bell can also be used to redirect the owner in different directions. Another item is an inflatable Pink Panther, which can be used to distract Clouseau. Reception Some critics considered the game to be a disappointment, and others believed that only Pink Panther fans would enjoy it. Reviewers were critical of the game's control and difficulty. Mark Patterson of Commodore User stated that Pink Panther \\"was a potentially good idea but it's over-shadowed by its extreme and sometimes tedious level of difficulty.\\" Gordon Hamlett of Your Amiga called the gameplay \\"disastrous,\\" stating that it was too complicated to use items in the game. Hamlett wrote, \\"The objects are frequently unidentifiable and by the time you have worked out what you think you might like to try, your master has hit a wall and you have to start all over again.\\" The Games Machine also criticized the \\"awkward\\" system used to manipulate the homeowner's movements, stating that it \\"requires rapid and accurate reactions, and if a single mistake is made, you have to go right back to the beginning.\\" Tony Horgan of Commodore Computing International considered the \\"extremely awkward controls\\" to be one of the worst aspects of the game, writing that \\"the combinations of joystick position and fire button needed to select and place the right object can be infuriatingly difficult to carry out.\\" Eugene Lacey of Computer and Video Games was also critical of the number of joystick and key-pressing maneuvers required to select and activate items, and stated that the game would have benefited from a higher degree of playability. Steve Merrett of ST Action wrote, \\"Having to redirect the sleepwalker is tedious and having finally managed it on one occasion, the wretched Inspector caught me straight away.\\" The graphics were generally praised on the Amiga and Atari ST. However, Rod Lawton of ACE wrote, \\"It's all pretty enough, but the graphics are nothing special by 16-bit standards\\". The graphics of the other versions received some criticism. The Games Machine wrote that the graphics \\"predictably fall short of the 16 bit versions.\\" The magazine considered the Commodore 64 (C64) version the best-looking of the 8-bit versions, while stating that the Amstrad CPC version had \\"cramped sprites\\". Critics stated that the ZX Spectrum version suffered from attribute clash. Horgan, reviewing the C64 version, stated that the Pink Panther's limited frames of animation \\"are not enough to give fluid movement.\\" Thomas Brandt of Aktueller Software Markt praised all aspects of the Amiga version, including the graphics and sound. Hamlett praised the sound as well, and The Games Machine praised the music. Reviewers for Zzap!64 criticized the music, which was described by Horgan as depressing. Reviewers for ST Action criticized the lack of the Pink Panther theme music, and Lawton considered the music to be a poor imitation of the theme. Reviewers for Crash criticized the lack of music in the 48k and 128k versions of the ZX Spectrum game. Amiga Review criticized the instruction manual for being vague, Published as part of volume 5, issue 8 of The Australian Commodore and Amiga Review (August 1987). and other critics stated that the manual was poorly translated from German. The Atari ST version received some criticism for its slow loading.

The player has a gun and limited ammunition for the next three levels, which take place in a hospital, a hotel, and a goods yard. In the final level, the player faces off against Rostavili. The gameplay occupies only the middle portion of the screen for a cinematic widescreen effect. Various subgames are also played throughout the main game, each with their own objective. One subgame has the player trying to break apart a hot rock using only Danko's hand. In a different subgame, the player must put a torn dollar bill back together. Another subgame has the player shoot enemies who pop out of closed doors. Reception Red Heat received praise for its graphics.

Life Montanari was born in Quilmes Partido in 1943. She made her film debut in Masterpieces of Terror when she was eighteen. When she was 21, she married the successful film playwright Abel Santa Cruz. The marriage lasted a year. Abel Santa Cruz went on to marry again and to write many more film scripts. Montanari worried that critics would say that she had married him to advance her career. Montanari is remembered for starring in Arthur Miller's play Panorama from the bridge with Alfredo Alc√≥n in the theatre. When she was 40 she had an affair with the 24 year old Dario Grandinetti. She broke off the relationship revealing later that it was because of their age difference. and the fuss that was made. The relationship lasted two years, although Montanari said that is should have been longer. In soap operas she was the heroine of La Cruz de Marisa Cruces, La Sombra, Stefania, Between love and power, All yours, The lion and the rose, and When love is guilty. In the 1990s, he starred in the telecomedy Son de ten for three years. Years later she was the villain in Alen Moonlight and Emerald Necklace. Her last film in 2017 was the horror genre \\"Mirada de cristal\\". The film by Leandro Montejano and Ezequiel Endelman was shown in horror conventions. In 1998 she took a role in the Argentine telenovela Gasoleros where the drama takes place in and around a car workshop and a local bar owned by Montanari's character Emilia. Gasoleros won nine Mart√≠n Fierro Awards, the highest award in Argentine television.

It was previously called Columbia Villa. It is operated by the city's public housing authority, Home Forward, and is the largest public housing development in the state. Description New Columbia is Oregon's largest public housing development. It occupies the northeast corner of the Portsmouth Neighborhood, bordered on the north by Columbia Blvd, on the east by Woolsey Avenue, on the south by Houghton Street, and on the west by Adriatic Avenue. It contains McCoy Park and several pocket parks, such as the New Columbia Pocket Park. It is served by Rosa Parks Elementary School and the Charles Jordan Community Center, which hosts the North Portland chapter of the Boys & Girls Club. As of 2019, the development had 1,847 residents. 47% of those are African-American, 26% are Hispanic, and 23% are white. History =Early history= The site of New Columbia was originally built as Columbia Villa in 1942 by Home Forward, then called the Housing Authority of Portland (HAP). The Villa was built to house the influx of shipyard workers who came to the area as ship production expanded in response to World War II. The low- density project spread 400 low-rise apartment units over 82 acres with a suburban-style street layout. It would be one of two HAP worker housing projects that would survive after the war as low-income public housing, when the units were converted to low-income housing for veterans at the end of the war. The project maintained a positive public image through the 1960s, being praised for its beauty in a 1962 issue of The Oregonian. However, by 1976, the same newspaper described the area as \\"an institutional compound\\". =Rise of crime and city response= The shift in the 1970s has been attributed to changes in public housing regulations, persistent poverty, and the spread of heroin addiction. A Portland Police gang detective reported that in 1987, a resident alerted him to the presence of members of the Californian 357 Crips in the Tamarack Apartments of Columbia Villa, who were later joined by members of other Californian Crips chapters, and began distributing crack cocaine in the area. The arrival of the drug coincided with further decline in living conditions, as was the case in many public housing neighborhoods across the country. The Villa was then the site of the city's first known drive-by shooting in 1988, when local Crips leader Joseph Ray Winston was murdered at a park on North Woolsey Avenue. Three bystanders were also injured in the shooting. The eponymous Columbia Villa Crips are still recognized by Multnomah County as an active Crips chapter. In response to rising crime in the neighborhood, the City of Portland, in cooperation with Multnomah County and the State of Oregon, initiated a Community Service Intervention Program focused on reducing crime and the fear of crime, and improving the quality of life in Columbia Villa. The CSIP worked to improve communication between social service agencies and changed police approaches to focus on community policing practices. This effort was also assisted by a coalition of resident activists who tasked themselves with rebuilding community infrastructure. The strategy was widely regarded as successful, and was used as a national model for improving public safety in crime-stricken neighborhoods. However, the stigma carried by the neighborhood would remain, with a 2003 article on the area in Willamette Week referring to it as \\"Portland's ghetto\\". =Redevelopment as New Columbia= In 1994, the HAP moved forward on a plan to completely demolish and rebuild the area with $35 million in funding secured from a federal HOPE VI grant, as well as funding from other sources that brought the project total to $151 million. The HAP cited substandard housing and infrastructure, as well as the street layout's inherently isolating effect on the neighborhood, as factors in the necessity for a complete rebuild. However, in comments about the plan, Portland City Commissioner Erik Sten told the Willamette Week, \\"there are human problems that no architect or urban planner in the world can design away\\". The rebuild required nearly 400 families to move away from the area for the construction period between 2003 and 2005. Residents were given the choice between transferring to other public housing or receiving a Section 8 voucher to use in securing privately owned rental housing. Moving, advising, and transportation services were also provided to facilitate residents' moves. In all, the cost of relocation services totaled approximately $4.25 million, with 74 percent of residents opting to receive section 8 vouchers, 23 percent moving to other public housing options, and 3 percent choosing to forego further housing assistance. Residents were still affected by other disruptive factors, such as the fact that 46% of school-age children who relocated had to change schools. Charles Jordan Community Center Not all Columbia Villa structures were demolished, and many were salvaged so that building materials could be recycled. Local house moving companies purchased 23 duplexes and moved them to other sites. Concrete and asphalt from old home foundations and street surfaces were salvaged and ground into fill material for structures and road bases in the new construction. In all, 82 percent of building materials from the demolition process were recycled. The new construction replaced 462 units with 850 units, 200 of which were single-family houses that were sold at market prices. The remaining units were government subsidized low-income apartments. Five different home builders were contracted to build the single- family homes, in an attempt to diversify the appearances of the houses. The project also added McCoy Park, a community center, a life-long learning center, an elementary school, and several retail spaces. =Recent history= New Columbia has been the subject of criticism from local media and urban planning researchers. One point of criticism was the HAP's decision to list homes at market value while leaving apartments as the only subsidized option for low-income residents. The development has been described as a \\"public housing island\\" in criticisms alleging that the goals for community integration put forth by the HAP were never met. Some residents have complained that important notices, including those that affect residency eligibility, are often distributed in English only, in spite of the high number of non-English speaking refugee families in the community. In contrast, the Portland Police Bureau released statistics that showed a much lower crime rate within New Columbia compared to the greater Portsmouth neighborhood, indicating that the development's reputation as the center of criminal activity was no longer accurate. However, the Villa was not free from the threat of violence. In 2007, the HAP and local gang experts declared that a turf war was developing between gangs in New Columbia. The new complex experienced its first shooting murder in 2010, when a 17-year-old boy was shot in the back by another teenager. In May 2011, an 18-year-old man was shot and killed during the night alongside McCoy Park. On June 30, 2014, New Columbia experienced its first drive-by murder since 1994. Portland Police established the New Columbia Policing Team in 2012 in an effort to improve community perceptions of police through face-to-face interactions with residents, including during follow-up investigations. The team places a focus on connecting residents to social services and arbitrating issues between neighbors and family members. A resident Home Forward employee who reported serving as an unofficial liaison between residents and police stated that the team's work had resulted in more residents reporting incidents directly to the police, rather than anonymously through her. However, tensions with police continued. In 2013, officers assigned to the team came under public scrutiny for arresting a 9-year-old girl and taking her to police headquarters in Downtown Portland for fingerprinting and mugshots after she got in a fight with another child at the Boys & Girls Club. Community programs Village Gardens (2019) The development offers various community programs intended to raise the quality of life for its residents. The Resident Community Builder program allows residents in good standing to assist in organizing and facilitating community activities in exchange for sliding-scale financial compensation. Community Builders assist with the community newsletter, town hall meetings, litter cleanup, and event planning. They also help facilitate other programs, such as the K-CHING Youth Employment Program, which is a paid work experience program for 11-17 year-olds in the community. One historical problem faced by New Columbia was its status as a low-income community paired with its status, according to the city and the USDA, as a food desert. Planners included a grocery retail space in the development, but its first two occupants, Big City Produce and AJ Java, went out of business. A non-profit community grocery store called the Village Market now occupies the space. Even after the opening of closeout chain Grocery Outlet in nearby St. Johns, Village Market reported growing sales. Village Gardens is a community gardening program which provides residents with access to garden plots. The Market Gardener Program assists residents in using these plots to grow produce which can be sold at the New Columbia Farmers Market, the St. Johns Farmers Market, and Village Market. Organizers claimed that in 2016, sales from the program cycled nearly $12,000 into the neighborhood. The Portland Fruit Tree Project also worked alongside Village Gardens organizers to plant a community orchard of 20 fruit trees adjacent to the garden, as an addition to the garden project's existing stand of 14 trees. The Oregon Food Bank organizes and provides assistance to local teenage volunteers to run a food bank program called New Columbia Harvest Share. The food bank is designed to look like a traditional farmer's market. Volunteers complete a food literacy program and participate in organizing the food bank through a Youth Community Advisory Board. Many participating students incorporate their volunteer experiences and related learning into their college admissions applications and scholarship essays. Portrayal in film Multiple documentaries have featured the development. \\"Imagining Home\\" by Sue Arbuthnot and Richard Wilhelm focuses on the transition between Columbia Villa and New Columbia, financial struggles of businesses in the community, and neighborhood tensions between homeowners and renters. \\"Killingsworth\\" by Tom Olsen Jr. focuses on the life of Portland Crips leader Anthony Branch Jr., including many aspects of early Portland gang development which took place in Columbia Villa.

In a vasculitic neuropathy there is damage to the vessels that supply blood to the nerves. It can be as part of a systemic problem or can exist as a single-organ issue only affecting the peripheral nervous system (PNS). It is diagnosed with the use of electrophysiological testing, blood tests, nerve biopsy and clinical examination. It is a serious medical condition that can cause prolonged morbidity and disability and generally requires treatment. Treatment depends on the type but it is mostly with corticosteroids or immunomodulating therapies.  Types  There are three main categories of vasculitic neuropathies: primary, secondary and non-systemic. = Primary systemic vasculitic neuropathy = Some patients with systemic vasculitis will have their multi-organ disease spread to the peripheral nervous system; this is primary vasculitic neuropathy. Some examples of systemic vasculitic disease are: IgA vasculitis, Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitides such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). = Vasculitic neuropathy secondary to other disease = Some patients with a non-vasculitic systemic disease or another illness such as infection or malignancy can subsequently develop vasculitic neuropathy as a direct consequence of the former illness; this is secondary vasculitic neuropathy. Some examples of such illness which can cause vasculitic neuropathy are: * Connective tissue diseases: rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, primary sj√∂gren's, dermatomyositis. * Infectious diseases: hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cytomegalovirus, lyme disease, human T-cell-lymphotrophic virus-I, parvovirus B19. * Malignancy. * Drugs. *Vaccinations. = Non-systemic vasculitic neuropathy = Non-systemic vasculitic neuropathy (NSVN) is a diagnosis of elimination. When no systemic illness can be found, yet evidence of a vasculitic neuropathy exists, a diagnosis of non-systemic vasculitic neuropathy is made. It is a single-organ problem. A nerve biopsy is required in order to make the diagnosis of non-systemic vaculitic neuropathy. There are distinct subtypes of NSVN with evolving cateregorisation in the literature. Currently accept subtypes are: * 'Classical' distal-predominant NSVN * Wartenberg migratory sensory neuropathy * Post-surgical inflammatory neuropathy * Diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathy (lumbosacral, thoracic or cervical predominant) * Neuralgic amyotrophy * Non-systemic skin/nerve vasculitis (for example, cutaneous PAN)  'Classical' distal-predominant NSVN  There is ongoing debate over this categorisation, particularly its overlap with the condition non-diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathy. As the name suggests it involves a clinical picture where the nerve damage is distally predominant as demonstrated in a nerve biopsy.  Warternberg migratory sensory neuropathy  Warternberg migratory sensory neuropathy is typically a multi-focal neuropathy where there is pure sensory deficits. It is characterised by sudden-onset and chronicity as well as having a propensity for relapse. It generally resolves slowly with time.  Postsurgical inflammatory neuropathy  Postsurgical inflammatory neuropathy is typically a multi-focal neuropathy which manifests thirty days after a surgical procedure. It mostly presents with motor and sensory symptoms. It is generally a self-limiting condition that has resolved with and without treatment.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis of a vasculitic neuropathy depends on whether the patient first presents with multiple symptoms pointing at a systemic disorder or else primary neuropathic complaints. In the former case the patient is more likely to be assessed first by a rheumatologist and in the latter a neurologist or neurosurgeon.  Treatments  Treatment of vasculitic neuropathy depends on the type.

It has smooth bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, ribbed flower buds in groups of seven, creamy white flowers and shortened spherical fruit. Description Eucalyptus rugulata is a mallet or tree that typically grows to a height of but does not form a lignotuber. It has smooth grey bark that is shed in strips. Adult leaves are the same dark, glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are an elongated oval shape, long and wide with a ribbed floral cup and a smooth, conical operculum. Flowering has been recorded in November and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, shortened spherical capsule with the valves protruding strongly but fragile. Taxonomy Eucalyptus rugulata was first formally described in 2002 by Dean Nicolle in the journal Nuytsia from material collected east of Verley in 2000. The specific epithet (rugulata) is from the Latin word rugula meaning \\"wrinkle\\" or \\"corrugation\\", referring to the distinctly wrinkled dried fruit, but also the rugged habitat where this species grows. Distribution and habitat This mallet grows on gravelly hills, often in more or less pure stands, between South Ironcap and Hatter Hill, east of Varley and north-east of Lake King.

Early life and education Luan was born on 17 November 1973 in the village of Gloƒëane, near Deƒçani (), in Kosovo, then part of Yugoslavia. His paternal descent is from Berish√´ in northern Albania, around the city of Puk√´. He spent his youth in his native village with his parents and siblings, and completed primary school in Rzniƒá () and secondary school in Deƒçani and Gjakova. His elder brother Ramush Haradinaj was former Prime Minister of Kosovo. Military Career Luan with his brother Shkelzen Haradinaj and their fellow comradew were among the first nuclei of armed resistance in the Dukagjin since November 1993. From that time, Luan Haradinaj with brothers, separately with Ramush Haradinaj, Shkelzen, Daut and friends of the cause, such as: Lahi Brahimaj, Agim Zeneli, Adrian Krasniqi, with all his youthful strength he had begun work in organizing armed groups. Having demonstrated exceptional diligence but also exceptional organizational skills, the Kosovo Liberation Army General Staff, since 1994, assigns the task of chief of logistics. Luan Haradinaj with brothers and companions of the cause, besides working on supplying weapons to future Kosovo Liberation Army fighters, he also participated in organizing and conducting a series of combat actions against the Serbian police, especially at strategic points and at police stations in De√ßan. Luan stood out among his companions for his honesty, , solidarity, and above all for the care he showed for them when crossing the border. Since his military cause had not stopped for many years, he had memorized the paths to cross, where he was always in the front rows of liberators. =Military education in Albania= During his stay in Albania, Luan was introduced to a wide circle of Soldiers from all captive Albanian lands,especially Kosovo. Luan also maintained contact with the legendary Kosovo Liberation Army commander Adem Jashari, Rexhep Selimi and Sylejman Selimi, Abedin Rexha and Fehmi Lladrovci. He has maintained contacts with Zahir Pajaziti and Ilir Konusevci. The contribution of the Haradinaj brothers to the expansion and consolidation of the ranks of the Kosovo Liberation Army is a very important chapter of struggle for freedom, while the momentum, temperament, ingenuity and determination of Luan Haradinaj have remained indeniable in the memory of all soldiers of Kosovo Liberation Army. In the face of the occupation forces in the spring of 1997, numerous liberation groups went from Kosovo to Albania and from Albania to Kosovo, although Serbian occupation forces had reinforced all crossings, the first KLA Soldiers and rescuers had penetrated. The most guarded and fortified border in the world, the boundary that once divided the territories of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Albania, however, had begun to become passable to KLA Soldiers, at any time of the year, at any time of day or night. Death On May 6, 1997, Luan Haradinaj, along with his brother Ramush Haradinaj and other KLA Soldiers had taken route to cross the border near the village of Vlahne of Has, in the direction of Kuzhin. On that day, the Serbian forces had set up an ambush, Luan, was leading the soldiers, was first to be ambushed by the serbian military and police forces. On this occasion, Rafet Rama was also seriously injured, Ramush Haradinaj and Fehmi Lladrovci were also wounded. In those moments, armed conflict had begun. The Yugoslav forces hit with heavy artillery in order to annihilate all Albanian fighters. After many attempts and a frantic counterattack by the Kosovo Liberation Army, Ramush Haradinaj manages to get closer to his brother's body. Upon seeing Luan Haradinaj lying on his face, Ramush discovers that Luan had fallen. Under the unstoppable barrage of enemy grenades and bullets, Ramush Haradinaj manages to retrieve his brother's lifeless body. After four hours of travel, retreating from enemy fire, Ramush and his comrades carry the body of Luan Haradinaj and head to the village of Vlahne. There, with deep sorrow in their souls, with honors is buried the body of the nation's martyr, Luan Haradinaj. His brothers, companions and fellow fighters continue their way of liberation until June 21, 1999, when serbian Forces in joint effort from KLA and NATO are expelled from Kosovo. Legacy On August 24, 1999, the body of Martyr Luan Haradinaj, his brothers and comrades-in-law, was taken from his burial ground in Vlahne and re-buried in his native village, in the heroic (formerly Glogjan) Qendresa he had written long enough during the liberation war. pages of heroism and glory. In honor and commemoration of his magnificent work, the General Staff of the Liberation Army.

She is professor of applied ecology at the University of Exeter and she looks at the health of social insects and how they pollinate plants.  Education and career  Osborne was educated at the University of Cambridge, she graduated with a BA in Natural Sciences in 1989 and a PhD in pollination ecology in 1994. She was a postdoctoral researcher at Rothamsted Research and remained there, progressing to principal investigator in 2006. In 2012 she moved to the University of Exeter's Penryn Campus to be a senior lecturer. In 2013 she was appointed chair in applied ecology and in 2017 she was made director of Exeter University's Environment and Sustainability Institute.  Research  Osborne's research looks at the interactions between plants, insects and the environment, and their influence on ecosystem services. Her research has shown that diseases such as deformed wing virus and the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae can pass from managed honeybee colonies to wild bumblebee colonies. To simulate the different pressures on a bee colony her team created BEEHAVE, a computer model to test how conditions such as availability of pollen and presence of insecticides, can influence the health and survival of a honeybee hive. Osborne's group have used different tracking techniques to look at social insects. They tracked honeybees with transponders and showed that they can forage far from their colony even when carrying diseases and they radiotagged asian hornets in the UK to track their dispersal and locate their nests. She has also investigated pollination in food crops of economic importance such as courgettes and has researched the resources of different oil seed rape varieties that are available to pollinators, such as the amount of nectar and number of flowers. Osborne has also looked at whether the manipulation of flowering plants to produce seedless fruits, parthenocarpy, could be a way to produce crops without the need for pollination  Awards  Osborne, with collaborators at Exeter, was awarded the BBSRC Innovator of the Year award for Social Impact in 2017 for their BEEHAVE model which was 'helping build pollinator resilience through informed land management and beekeeping'.

The death penalty is enforced rarely, however, with the last execution occurring in 2017. Hanging is the method of choice for civilian executions, however shooting is a legal form of execution in certain circumstances.  Capital offenses  The following crimes may be punished with death under Kuwaiti civilian law: premeditated murder, terrorism resulting in death (mandatory), perjury resulting in an innocent execution, destroying buildings belonging to the government or those known to be inhabited, rape, kidnapping, drug trafficking, and espionage. Under the Kuwaiti Military Code, the following military offences may be punished with death: revealing classified information, cowardice, deserting one's post or duty, collaboration, insurrection, insubordination, and interfering with action in the line of defence. As well as this, enemy soldiers can be executed if they commit war crimes or spy on the Kuwaiti military or government.  Persons excused from the death penalty  The following offenders shall not be subject to Capital Punishment if found guilty of a Capital offense: * Pregnant women * Women with small children *Minors (under 18 years of age) at the time the crime was committed These offenders will have their sentences commuted to life imprisonment. Mentally ill persons are excluded from this list because they cannot be held responsible for criminal charges under Kuwaiti law in any instance.  Legal proceedings  = Judicial review and appeal = After a person is sentenced to death in a Kuwaiti court, their case is automatically reviewed by the Court of Appeal, of whom take into consideration the crime, evidence reviewed by the court, the previous convictions of defendant and other factors. If the court of appeal rejects this appeal, then they go to the Court of Cassation (Supreme Court) of which is the highest governing legal body in the country. Once it has been reviewed, the Emir of Kuwait must approve of the sentence. Once this occurs, an execution order is issued by the Chief Justice, specifying the date, time, place and method (usually hanging) of the execution, of which is given to the Prosecutor. = Execution = Since 2002, executions have occurred at Nayef Palace, but not in public as was the case before. Prisoners are held in solitary confinement until the day of their execution, where they are transported to the execution ground. At about 8am, prisoners are hooded with a black hood, unlike the British style white hood and their arms and legs are pinioned (strapped). New steel gallows were fitted in the early 2000s and have been used for executions since then. A noose is put around their neck with the knot below the ear and the trapdoor is opened. They are given measured drops in order to break their necks, a development of the method practiced in the United Kingdom. The press and public are allowed to view the dangling bodies after the execution. The press have been reported to publish images of the dead bodies in newspapers to serve as a deterrent against crime.

Early life Luan was born on 17 November 1973 in the village of Gloƒëane, near Deƒçani (), in Kosovo, then part of Yugoslavia. His paternal descent is from Berish√´ in northern Albania, around the city of Puk√´. Military career Upon learning of the attack by Serbian forces on Adem Jashari and his family in Prekaz killing over 20 family members while they sat in their house, in March 1998, Shkelzen Haradinaj, with friends operating in the Dukagjin sub-zone, carried out over 22 armed actions against Serbian police bases overnight of the Serbian paramilitary in the Dukagjin region. Shkelzen Haradinaj was a devout fighter who actively worked at all stages of the KLA's development, staying at the forefront of the war at all times. He rode to war, reaching the highest peaks of the fighting organization, which excelled in all encounters with Serbian occupation forces. Shkelzen Haradinaj fought at the Heroic Battle of March 24, '98, held in Glogjan near De√ßan, and will stand out as an excellent organizer and fighter alongside brothers Ramush Haradinaj and Daut Haradinaj, first cousin Bujar and other fighters, such as Gazmend Mehmetaj, Agron Mehmetaj and Hima Haradinaj, who had the great fortune to be the first fallen in frontal war in the Dukagjin Zone. Its noted that in this glorious Battle in which other members of Shkelzen's close family, Father Hilmiu, the brothers Enveri and Frash√´ri, Sister Mejremja and other comrades, participated, caused great damage to the Serbian forces in men and artillery. Death On April 16, 1999, in the Maznik Mountains near Deƒçani, the Serbian forces planned to enter sheltered towns with Albanian civilians and to later massacre them. After hearing the plans of the Serbian Forces, Shkelzen Haradinaj and his Special Unit of the KLA marched to the Maznik Mountains in order to rescue the Albanian civilians from the Serbian forces. During a fierce, battle against Serbian forces, and in defence of the civilian population sheltered in the Maznik Mountains, Shkelzen Haradinaj falls alongside fellow soldiers and comrades Fatmir Nimanaj, Hasim Halilaj and Luan Nimanaj. The fighting was extremely fierce and in close proximity, where 15 Serbian Soldiers were also killed . Sparked by the rock's hardness, the majesty of the hills and the immense fortitude, the bullet that he took to his chest did not drop him. He wounded an enemy with a bullet in the face as his last action in battle. Legacy Due to the Intervention of the Special Unit of the KLA with the commander Shk√´lzen Haradinaj, the Albanian civilians in the Maznik Mountains survived and could flee from the region. Personal life Shk√´lzen Haradinaj was married and had two sons Shqipdon and Luan Haradinaj (named after his dead brother Luan Haradinaj). Shqipdon died in 2007 after an car accident, aged only 11.

A diver on board the submarine would be able to climb out of and drill holes in the submarine's hull, so the vessel would sink and hence form a barrier against naval attack. Winstrup's patent application was rejected by the patent authorities due to technical shortcomings.

While assigned to 5th SFAB, Advisors are required to attend a 26-day Combat Advisor Training Course at Fort Benning, GA and are afforded the opportunity to attend other career- enhancing schools that promote the Advisor mission. Graduates will have the requisite knowledge, skills, and attributes critical to the successful execution of Security Force Assistance (SFA) tasks. The eleven advisor attributes are disciplined, mature, sound judgment, initiative, cool under pressure, tolerance for ambiguity, open-minded, empathetic, situationally aware, patient, and morally straight. National Defense Strategy The 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) describes a need for the United States to transition from counter-insurgency to long term strategic competition against powerful adversaries with near-peer capabilities. To achieve this transition, the strategy directs military forces to ‚Äúexpand the competitive space‚Äù and ‚Äústrengthen alliances and attract new partners.‚Äù Security Force Assistance Brigades are specifically designed and organized to achieve these two critical mandates in the NDS. Composed of 820 specially selected officers and non- commissioned officers who must undergo a rigorous screening process, the SFAB is manned and equipped to operate in small teams in the competitive spaces of the globe where this great power conflict is most intense. The SFAB‚Äôs mission is to train and advise conventional military forces in order to build long lasting trust among like-minded professional military forces and to establish the United States as the partner of choice in regions of the world that are vital to US strategy. 5th SFAB organizational structure 5th SFAB is organized like a traditional Brigade Combat Team with 2 Infantry Battalions, 1 Cavalry Squadron, and a Fires, Engineer, and Logistics Battalion. These six battalions and the brigade staff are organized into 61 separate advisor teams that range in size from four to twelve personnel and are generally led by a post-command Captain and a Sergeant First Class. Teams are organized to provide infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineer, or logistics training and support. With this broad spectrum of conventional capabilities, 5th SFAB is able to provide graduate-level training and advisory support to the most advanced military partners in the world. Advisors are selected into the Brigade at all levels from Corporal to Colonel based on their expertise in the conduct of large scale combat operations (LSCO) at the squad to division level. Advisors also must demonstrate a high level of physical fitness, stamina under pressure, and the ability to work well in small teams with limited guidance and contact with a higher headquarters.

Based in Aleppo, Syria, Al Kindi Ensemble is mostly known for its works on the Arab-Muslim and Sufi musical traditions. History Founded in 1983 in Aleppo by Julien Weiss as a tribute to Al-Kindi, a philosopher and music theorist of Arab world, Al Kindi Ensemble began its journey with the spirit to explore Arab-Andalusian, Oriental, Turkish and Iranian influences in music. The ensemble wanted to acquire a repertoire from the entire Arab world. At the beginning the group consisted of only three instrumentalists. The Egyptian Tar and Riqq player Adel Schams Eldin, Julien Weiss and the Syrian Nay player Ziad Kadhi Amin. Initially, the ensemble only played instrumental pieces. Julien Weiss later decided to expand the group. He traveled to Syria and met with Sheikh Hamza Shakk√ªr, a well-known singer of classical music. Shakk√ªr was also the head of the Sufi community of the whirling dervishes. In 1986, Weiss converted to Islam and settled in Aleppo. There he developed a collaboration between him and many singers of classical music from Iraq and Syria, such as Adib Dayikh and the Tunisian singer and musician Lotfi Bouchnak. Musical Style Accompanied by loud and longer devotional chanting, the group uses multiple instruments such as oud, spike fiddle, flute, percussion and zither to create a melodious symphony. The music is often accompanied by whirling dervishes during their concerts such as Sahin Nasir from Istanbul, Maher and Hatem Al Jamal from Damascus, and Yahyah Hamami and Yousef Shreymo from Aleppo.

Although originally from El Paso, Texas, Escobar-Leanse has performed all over the country and several parts of Europe. She is an alumna of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, class of 2009.  Early life  Escobar-Leanse was born in Dallas, Texas, in 1988. She moved to El Paso, Texas, when she was a year old. Raised by a mother who owned a party decorating company, Escobar-Leanse grew up in a household that always emphasized creating things by hand and reusing materials around the house. This greatly influenced her eventual career in puppetry, which focuses on utilizing recyclable material. Escobar-Leanse began acting at the age of four at the El Paso Jewish Community Center. At the age of six, she joined Kids-N- Co, a theater company geared towards hands-on production training for young people. She stayed with this company until she was 12 years old. Escobar- Leanse remained in El Paso until she was 19, when she moved to New York City.

Her work with the Puppet Shakespeare Players includes Puppet Hamlet in 2012, Puppet Romeo and Juliet in 2013 and 2017, and Puppet Titus Andronicus in 2014. Escobar-Leanse was lauded for her work in Puppet Titus Andronicus in the New York Times article \\"Shakespeare with Strings, the Silly Kind\\": > As Titus‚Äôs daughter, Lavinia ‚Äî usually a subordinate victim role ‚Äî Mindy > Leanse does wonders. Lavinia may lose her hands and tongue, but Ms. Leanse > turns her puppet, an innocent red countenance surrounded by curly blond > locks, into a marvel of movement and guttural utterances who sticks up for > herself. Her role in the Puppet Shakespeare Players has grown from performer to puppet wrangler to puppet captain over the years.

Her work in The Last Rat of Theresienstadt is a perfect example of this: > While the subject matter is the Holocaust, whose victims we honor through > remembrance of that time, our themes are very relevant today, with anti- > Semitism on the rise and bigotry and racism creating chasms between people > struggling to live as neighbors in countries all over the world. Escobar-Leanse has also been an actress and puppeteer with the Wildlife Conservation Society since 2015. She helps bring environmental education to children throughout New York City.

One year later, she joined the faculty at York, becoming an Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Science. In 1996, she moved to the University of Toronto Department of Physics. She was the only female faculty member in the department at the time. She was promoted to Associate Professor in 2001 and full Professor in 2006. After her graduate studies, Strong's research interests turned to Earth's atmosphere. Strong was the principal investigator of the Middle Atmosphere Nitrogen TRend Assessment (MANTRA) project from 1998 to 2006. This collaboration used a series of high-altitude balloon flights to measure trace gasses in the stratosphere over North America, including mid- latitude stratospheric ozone and compounds of nitrogen and chlorine that interact with ozone in the upper atmosphere. Strong has traveled to Eureka, Nunavut since 1999 to conduct research in the Canadian high arctic. She was one of the founders of the Canadian Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Change (CANDAC) which established the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL) on Ellesmere Island in 2005. The PEARL station provides long-term monitoring of the Arctic atmosphere and data to track its evolution and variability. She was the Director of the NSERC CREATE Training Program in Arctic Atmospheric Science, which ran from 2010 to 2016. This program provided students and postdoctoral fellows with training in Arctic atmospheric science. Strong founded the University of Toronto Atmospheric Observatory (TAO) in 2001, which monitors trace gasses in the stratosphere and troposphere from the roof of the McLennan Physical Laboratories Burton Tower at the University of Toronto. She is also the principal investigator of the Canadian Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer Observing Network (CAFTON), which uses several monitoring stations across Canada, including TAO, to measure gasses and monitor changes in the atmosphere. In 2010, she was a visiting fellow at the Centre for Atmospheric Chemistry at the University of Wollongong in Australia. Strong was the director of the School of the Environment at the University of Toronto from 2013 to 2018. She also served as Vice-President (2018-2019) and is the current President of the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society. In July 2019, she began a 5-year term as the chair of the Department of Physics at the University of Toronto, the first woman to hold the position. She joined the Board of Directors of the SNOLAB Institute in July 2019. Strong is a member of the Centre for Global Change Science and the Graduate Faculty of the School of the Environment at the University of Toronto.

They are traditionally involved in agriculture and were involved in toddy tapping and artisanal fishing.  Etymology  The term Pallar is derived from the Tamil word pallam meaning \\"pit\\" or \\"low-lying area\\". The reference is to their traditional occupation toiling in artificially lowered rice paddy fields.  History  = Mythological origin = According to myth, the Vellalar and Pallar are descendants of two farmer brothers. The property of the younger brother Pallan was destroyed by a storm. The older brother Vellalan gave Pallan shelter. After the death of Vellalan, his wife became the owner of the property and forced Pallan and his family to become agricultural laborers for her. = Early period = The Sri Lankan Pallar and the Pallars of Tamil Nadu share a common origin. The Pallars traditionally inhabited the fertile Sangam landscape known as Marutham. They were earlier known as Kadaisiyar, tenant farmers on the land of the Uzhavar or Kalamar. The women of this community were noted in Sangam literature for their expertise in paddy transplantation. = Medieval period = The Pallars migrated to Sri Lanka as serfs accompanied by their chiefs, on whose land they toiled. They migrated in large numbers mainly from Chola country in search of fertile land. Pallars settling in the Jaffna Peninsula, which was rich in Palmyra palm, joined others there involved in toddy tapping. Some Pallars were involved in other occupations, such as fishers, servants in forts, and harvesters of Indigo plant roots, contributing to the famous dye industry of Jaffna Kingdom. = Colonial period = Under colonial rule, castes such as the Pallars, Koviar and Nalavars were originally bonded in service to the colonial state. However, the rise of the Sri Lankan Vellalar under Dutch Ceylon reduced the status of these castes from tenant farmers to Vellalar slaves. The Pallars, Koviar and Nalavars were officially considered Adimaikal (a Tamil term for slave or menial labour). Large numbers of Pallars from the Coromandel Coast were summoned as slaves under this period by private individuals to work in tobacco plantation. After the end of slavery with British rule on the island, the Pallars largely remained as laborers and tenants. In the 20th century, the British recruited Pallars from Tamil Nadu to work in their tea estates. The Pallars and Paraiyars constituted over half of these workers and formed a significant part of the Up-country Tamil population.  Customs  The Pallars along with the Nalavars worship the caste deity Annamar. A wooden club is used for offering to the deity, suggesting a warrior cult. The Thurumbars serve as dhobi exclusively to the Pallars, Nalavars and Paraiyars. A yoke is used as cattle brand mark by the Pallars.

(1996). Protein Power: The High-Protein/Low Carbohydrate Way to Lose Weight, Feel Fit, and Boost Your Health-in Just Weeks!. Bantam Books.

Encyclopedia of Diet Fads: Understanding Science and Society, 2nd Edition. ABC-CLIO. pp. 177‚Äì178. According to the diet, insulin controls the storage of fat which is triggered by the intake of carbohydrates. Protein Power promotes an animal based diet rich in meat, dairy and eggs. The claims of the diet have not been scientifically demonstrated. Protein Power has been described as a fad diet and pseudoscientific.Stare, Fredrick John; Whelan, Elizabeth M. (1998).

High-protein diets such as Protein Power may bring about temporary weight loss via calorie restriction but are not effective for permanent weight control. Criticism Nutritionists Fredrick J. Stare and Elizabeth Whelan criticized the diet as \\"too lopsided to be healthful\\" and the Eades for assembling their own \\"facts\\" into an \\"antiscience hypothesis\\". They noted that \\"At a time when many years of scientific research are beginning to establish the unequivocal association between plant foods and disease prevention, it strikes us as unconscionable for two medical doctors to be striking out in the opposite direction.\\" In 2001, the American Heart Association‚Äôs Nutrition Committee issued a strong recommendation against high-protein diets including Protein Power and the Atkins diet.

He was known for his criticism of Jahmis, Mu'tazilis, and Anthropomorphists. He contradicted the Mu'tazili doctrine of Khalq al-Qur'an (Createdness of the Qur'an) by introducing a distinction between the speech of God (Kalam Allah) and its realisation.

Plot 14-year-old Mouse lives in Baltimore, Maryland with his single mother and younger sister. Mouse is interested in motorbikes, a big part of the culture in Baltimore, but his mother disapproves as his older brother Stro died in a biking accident at the age of 17. Once a week during the summer is an event called The Ride, where people bring out their motorbikes and do stunts in the street. Mouse‚Äôs mother forbids him from attending, but he sneaks out anyway to attend with his friends Lamont and Sweartagawd. Mouse purchases a run-down four-wheel motorbike and is detained by police while driving it home. He is picked up by police detective Rivers, who has known Mouse from a young age through a police outreach program with his school. Rivers tells Mouse he can come to him for advice any time and implores him to stay out of trouble, but Mouse ignores him. Mouse meets a new girl down the street, Nicki, who is interested in photography; Mouse invites her to come along to The Ride. There, Mouse attempts a trick on his four-wheeler but crashes; they later witness a biker gang known as the Midnight Clique lead the police on a high-speed chase and escape. One of the bikers is a local legend known as Blax, who recently got out of prison. Mouse, Lamont and Sweartagawd visit the Midnight Clique‚Äôs hangout spot later that night, who tells them to leave. Mouse later meets Blax outside a bike repair shop where he works as part of his parole program. Blax says he knew Mouse‚Äôs brother Stro, a member of the Clique; he invites Mouse into the shop and offers him a box of scraps to build his own bike. Mouse asks if Blax would provide Lamont and Sweartagawd with the same opportunity; Blax agrees, impressed with his loyalty. Mouse starts ditching his job at the local animal hospital to spend more time at Blax‚Äôs auto shop. Blax asks Mouse to deliver a rebuilt high-end bike to a customer across town. Mouse instead drives it to Nicki‚Äôs house and picks her up for a joyride. They are approached by Derrick, an old friend of Stro‚Äôs, who asks for a quick ride around the block; unable to say no, Mouse gives him the bike, and Derrick takes off. Unable to face Blax, Mouse goes to Lamont and Sweartagawd for help, who inform him that Derrick is notorious for chopping up bikes and selling the parts. The three confront Derrick at his chop shop to ask for the bike back; he pulls a gun on them and tells them to leave. The Midnight Clique arrive, led by Blax, who know everything; they beat Derrick and warn him to never steal from them again. Empowered, Lamont attacks a defenseless Derrick and nearly beats him to death before a Clique member holds him back. Blax, upset with Mouse, tells him he‚Äôs not allowed to work on building his bike anymore and will have to work hard around the shop to earn his respect back. Mouse, who is concerned about his mother falling behind on bills, instead asks Blax to get him on the auto shop payroll; Blax refuses. Mouse quits working at the shop and he, Lamont, and Sweartagawd join the Midnight Clique‚Äôs drug delivery operation; the Clique loans them brand-new bikes and pays them well. Nicki approaches Mouse in a park to give him a picture she took of him, but he acts disinterested, riding off with another girl. Meanwhile, Rivers keeps tailing him around town and pestering him about his activities; Mouse tells him to leave him alone. Rivers pays a visit to Blax in his shop and warns him to stay away from Mouse, considering him a bad influence on the teen. Mouse‚Äôs mother finds his hidden stash of hundred-dollar bills, and after he refuses to tell her where it came from she kicks him out of the house; Mouse moves in with Sweartagawd. Lamont hatches a plan to rob a local convenience store to prove their worth to the Clique; Mouse and a hesitant Sweartagawd agree. They ask the Clique for a gun, who gives them one; Blax notices and demands that the Clique leave Mouse alone, but they refuse as he‚Äôs a skilled rider for their operation. Blax summons Mouse to the garage to confront him, but Mouse notices something is wrong with Blax‚Äôs dog and insists they go to the vet immediately. The vet explains that the dog needs surgery to survive; Blax agrees only if Mouse performs the operation, which he successfully does. Blax then explains the truth of Stro‚Äôs death to Mouse: Blax offered him a job running drugs, and Stro died during the job. An upset Mouse leaves. As Mouse and his friends prepare the convenience store robbery, Lamont takes the gun, but Mouse insists they do not fire it. The robbery goes wrong when Lamont accidentally fires a shot and the owner‚Äôs wife returns fire, killing Sweartagawd. Mouse and Lamont flee separately as Detective Rivers, who had been tailing Mouse, gives chase. Mouse heads to Blax‚Äôs shop and explains everything as Rivers pulls up to the shop with backup. Blax tells Mouse to change into a worker‚Äôs uniform as an alibi and takes the fall for the robbery. Rivers, despite knowing the truth, arrests Blax. Rivers gives Mouse a ride home, where he reconciles with his mother. A year later, Mouse has returned to working at the vet and adopted Blax‚Äôs dog. He reconnects with Nicki and apologizes for his past behavior; she agrees to meet up with him again. Mouse runs into Lamont on the street but they have little to say to each other, having drifted apart. Mouse returns home to surprise his mother with fresh groceries.

Pictured: Irena (top)‚Äîthe ghetto was centered on the semicircle‚Äîthe airfield (right) and military installations (left). Thousands of Jews lived in the towns of Dƒôblin and in central Poland before World War II; Irena was the site of the Polish Air Force Academy from 1927. In September 1939, the town was captured during the German invasion of Poland and the persecution of Jews began with drafts into forced labor and the establishment of a Judenrat (\\"Jewish Council\\"). A ghetto was established in Irena in November 1940. It initially consisted of six streets and was an open ghetto (the Jews were not allowed to leave without permission, but non-Jews could enter). Many ghetto inhabitants worked on labor projects for Dƒôblin Fortress (a German Army base), the railway, and the Luftwaffe. Beginning in May 1941, Jews were sent to labor camps around Dƒôblin from the Opole and Warsaw ghettos. Conditions in the ghetto worsened in late 1941 due to increased German restrictions on ghetto inhabitants and epidemics of typhus and dysentery. The first deportation was on 6 May 1942 and took around 2,500 Jews to Sobib√≥r extermination camp. A week later, two thousand Jews arrived from Slovakia and hundreds more from nearby ghettos that had been liquidated. In October that same year, the Irena ghetto was liquidated; about 2,500 Jews were deported to Treblinka extermination camp while some 1,400 Jews were retained as inmates of forced-labor camps in the town. Unusually, the labor camp operated by the Luftwaffe‚Äîemploying, at its peak, about a thousand Jews‚Äîwas allowed to exist until 22 July 1944, less than a week before the area was captured by the Red Army. One of the last Jewish labor camps in the Lublin District, it enabled hundreds of Jews to survive the Holocaust. Some survivors returned home, where they faced harassment and murders, but all left by 1947.  Background  Jews in Dƒôblin greet Polish Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski after his capture of Dƒôblin during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, 1920. Dƒôblin and (, ) are located northwest of Lublin in Poland, at the confluence of the Vistula and Wieprz rivers and at an important junction on the Lublin‚ÄìWarsaw rail line. Local Jews supported the January Uprising in 1863. By the end of the nineteenth century, the area was a center of Hasidic Judaism; most Jews followed the Modzitz dynasty, named after the town, and there were also Gur Hasidim. Modzitz Rebbe Yisrael Taub settled in the town in 1889. Other Jews were Bundists or Zionists. Many Jews made their living as peddlers, shopkeepers, or artisans (especially in leatherwork and metalwork) and later participated in the development of the town as a summer resort. In 1927, the civilian population of Dƒôblin and Irena was 4,860, including 3,060 Jews. Beginning in 1927, Dƒôblin housed the Polish Air Force Academy, whose airfield was one of the largest in Poland. In 1936 and 1937, there were some incidents in which non-Jewish merchants vandalized their Jewish competitors' shops. German invasion Market square in Dƒôblin during the German occupation During the German invasion of Poland which started World War II in Europe, the Luftwaffe bombed Dƒôblin between 2 and 7 September 1939, targeting the military airfield, Polish Army ammunition stores, and a nearby bridge over the Vistula. Most Polish soldiers left the town on 7 September; on 11 September the remaining Polish forces detonated the ammunition and withdrew. The German Army arrived on 12 or 20 September. Many residents, both Jews and other residents of the area, had fled to escape the aerial bombardment. In the following weeks, most returned at the urging of the Germans. The Jews found that their properties had been ransacked and plundered. They were conscripted into forced-labor units that cleared up the bomb damage and repaired some of the buildings, and the Jewish community was forced to pay a fine of 20,000 z≈Çoty. During the German occupation, Dƒôblin and Irena became part of the Lublin District of the General Governorate occupation region. In late 1939, Jews were required to wear armbands with the Star of David, and some were conscripted for forced labor in Janisz√≥w, Be≈Ç≈ºec, and Paw≈Çowice. At the end of the year, the German occupiers forced Jews to form a (\\"Jewish Council\\"), as an interface between the Jewish community and Nazi demands. The was formed later than others in the region and had its offices on Bankowa Street. The first officials worked to reduce the impact of German demands and warned residents of searches. According to the Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, the first chair of the , Leizer Teichman, was dismissed in early 1941; survivors reported that he and his secretary were deported to WƒÖwolnica with their families after trying to bribe policemen. The was run temporarily by Kalman Fris, who resigned after a few months and was replaced by Vevel Shulman in August and then a Konin native named Drayfish in September 1941. According to Israeli historian David Silberklang, \\"Szymon Drabfisz\\" was the first chair and Teichman the second.  Ghetto  OpenStreetMap of Dƒôblin and environs, showing train station (upper left), Irena (labeled \\"Dƒôblin\\", right), airfield (green, lower right), Wieprz (bottom), Vistula (lower left), and Dƒôblin Fortress (left, in red) A Nazi ghetto was established in Irena in November 1940 or early 1941, probably on the orders of Kurt Lenk, the region's new land commissioner. Some Jews were forced to move from their homes to the ghetto. The motive was probably to keep Jews away from the two nearby military installations, a Luftwaffe airfield and a German Army base, which were filled with troops in preparation for the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union. The decree establishing the ghetto was not formally issued until 1942. Until 1942, Irena was an open ghetto (there was no physical fence, although the penalty for unauthorized departure was death) consisting of six streets. Its boundaries were initially Ok√≥lna Street, the Irenka River, Bankowa, and Staromiejska Streets. Staromiejska Street was removed from the ghetto in September 1942; its residents moved to Bankowa. Initially, non-Jews were allowed to enter and perhaps live in the ghetto, so many of the Jews were able to survive by trading material goods for food with them. A Polish-language secular school, run by Aida Milgroijm-Citronbojm, instructed 70 to 100 pupils. The Jewish Ghetto Police maintained order in the ghetto, and on the outside it was guarded by a (\\"Special Services\\") unit consisting of local (ethnic Germans) and Ukrainian Auxiliary Police. The unit was known for beating, humiliating, and killing ghetto inmates. In late 1941, non-Jewish Poles were banned from entering the ghetto, resulting in waste piling up and typhus and dysentery epidemics. The sick were treated at a thirty-bed hospital run by Isaar Kawa, a doctor from Konin; with the help of non-Jewish doctors, medicines were imported from Warsaw. Simultaneously, new restrictions were imposed by the Germans: the use of stoves was banned, winter clothing confiscated, and fuel imports forbidden. More Jews began to leave the ghetto to obtain essentials, resulting in twenty young women being discovered outside the ghetto and killed. Because conditions were better in Lublin District than in Warsaw, some Jews fled to towns there including Irena; twenty Jews were executed for being unregistered refugees. The s leadership was altered again as Drayfish was executed, accused of filing complaints with the Pu≈Çawy County administration; he was replaced by the businessman Yisrael Weinberg. In March 1941, 3,750 Jews lived in the ghetto, including 565 who were not from the area. These consisted mainly of Jews expelled from Pu≈Çawy and the German- annexed Reichsgau Wartheland, as well as some Jews who had come to live with relatives to avoid being trapped in the Warsaw Ghetto. Overcrowding was severe; there were 7‚Äì15 people per room. More Jews arrived in May 1941: 1,000 from the ghettos at Warsaw, Czƒôstochowa, and Opole, although they were not housed in the ghetto but at work sites in the area. On 13 and 14 May 1942, two transports totalling 2,042 Slovak Jews arrived from Pre≈°ov. Although they brought food with them, they were unused to the harsh conditions and many died of typhus due to the poor sanitation. More than 2,000 Jews were brought to Irena from nearby towns, having survived the liquidation of their communities because they had been selected to work. These included 300 people from Ryki, 300 from Gniewosz√≥w and Zwole≈Ñ, and a group from Stƒô≈ºyca. Other Jews had entered the ghetto after escaping roundups in Baran√≥w, Ryki, Gniewosz√≥w, and Adam√≥w (from early October). In August, 5,800 Jews were reported to be living in the ghetto, of whom only 1,800 were from Dƒôblin.  Forced labor  Exhumed mass grave at Stalag 307 (Dƒôblin Fortress) Furniture factory set up by the German Army in Dƒôblin Fortress Until late 1942, Jews earned wages as forced laborers, except those who were conscripted by the municipality for tasks such as street cleaning or snow clearing. Some Jews worked for German companies such as Schwartz and Hochtief, contracted by the Wehrmacht to do construction on the military bases in the town. The Ostbahn contracted Schultz to improve the railway between Lublin and Warsaw, a project which employed 300 Jews beginning in June 1941. Working conditions at this site were very harsh with Jews forced to work twelve hours each day. However, most Jews worked for the German Army or the Luftwaffe; women and children grew food for the military. Dƒôblin Fortress, which had been taken over by the German Army and where around 200 Jews from the ghetto worked, was the site of Stalag 307, a camp for Soviet prisoners of war, from 10 July 1941. An estimated 80,000 Soviet prisoners were imprisoned there; all died within a few months of starvation and disease. The Jews who worked there saw prisoners held in worse conditions than their own. The Jews from Dƒôblin and Irena tried to take the best jobs; 200 of the Slovak deportees ended up working for the municipality. An additional 200 of the Slovaks worked for the Schultz firm following an expansion. Survivors recalled that although German soldiers supervising the forced laborers tended to treat them relatively well, some ethnic Polish supervisors beat Jews, and the Ukrainian guards at the railway project were especially harsh, threatening prisoners with death. In May 1941, in preparation for the invasion of the Soviet Union, the Luftwaffe commissioned the firm Autheried to improve the airfield. They recruited 200 Jewish workers in Opole, many of whom were Austrian Jews who had been deported from Vienna in February 1941 and wanted to escape the harsh conditions in Opole. These Jews, as well as another four hundred recruited in Irena and the Lipowa 7 camp in Lublin, and 500 ethnic Polish workers, worked twelve hours a day levelling the runway and building roads, walls, air-raid shelters, and earth fortifications. They also built a barbed-wire-enclosed complex adjacent to the runway for craftsmen to work in. Following the completion of the project in October, the workers were dispersed to various projects around the town, an action which may have been related to the typhus epidemic. Some of the Jews from Vienna stayed at the airfield, having obtained permits to work on gravel transportation and building fuel tanks; they were the nucleus for the later labor camp. After the first deportation from the Irena ghetto on 6 May 1942, additional Jews tried to secure permits, often obtained through bribery, to avoid deportation. By October 1942, the camp had 543 legal residents. At this point there were five forced-labor camps around Dƒôblin: the Luftwaffe camp, the fortress, the train station (300 Jews), Lipova Street (200 Jews and ethnic Poles), and another near the municipal boundary (300 Jews).  Deportation, murder, and liquidation  =First deportation= The first deportation was on 6 May 1942, to clear space for the Slovak deportees who arrived a week later. A force composed of German and Ukrainian police and a few German SS and Ukrainian SS auxiliaries ordered Jews to assemble in the main square at 09:00. According to Yad Vashem, the Blue Police also participated. Probably because the Luftwaffe was seeking permission to recruit more laborers, the Jews had to wait for five hours. At 14:00, 1,000 Jews who already had work assignments were separated, and local employers began recruiting an additional 200‚Äì500 Jews. Forty or fifty people were killed trying to cross over to the working group. Around 2,300 to 2,500 Jews from Dƒôblin‚Äîmainly the elderly and families with small children‚Äîwere marched to the Dƒôblin train station (some away) at 18:00 and sent to Sobib√≥r extermination camp. The victims were beaten, and those who could not keep up were shot. Only late in the night were the Jews selected for labor allowed to return home. Every family was affected. After the deportation, the bodies of the dead were collected at the synagogue and removed from the ghetto in carts. During the next two days, more than four thousand Jews from north Pu≈Çawy County‚Äî200 from Bobrowniki (6 May), 1,800 from Ryki (7 May), 125 from Stƒô≈ºyca (7 May), 1,500 from Baran√≥w (8 May) and 500 from ≈Åysobyki (8 May)‚Äîwere also marched to Dƒôblin and deported to Sobib√≥r. This was half of a countywide extermination action in Pu≈Çawy County‚Äîthe first in a series of systematic, countywide deportations in the Lublin District as part of Operation Reinhard. The county's administrator, ordered it shortly after Sobib√≥r became operational; he was present in Dƒôblin during the deportation. =Second deportation= The next deportation, which coincided with the liquidation of the two remaining ghettos in Pu≈Çawy (Opole and Ko≈Ñskowola), took place on 15 October 1942; the previous day, all workers had been ordered to remain at their workplaces. Under the command of Grossman, gendarmes, Luftwaffe soldiers, and police auxiliaries rounded up the remaining Jewish population. Many Jews tried to avoid the roundup and enter the Luftwaffe camp, which at that time had 543 official residents. Some were turned away by the Jewish police there. Israeli historian Talia Farkash estimates that about 500, including 60‚Äì90 young children, managed to get in, mostly by paying bribes. Silberklang's estimate is that 1,000 Jews entered the camp, including 280 women and 100 children. The Jewish elder, Hermann Wenkert, later claimed that if he had allowed non-registered Jews entry, and they were discovered, everyone in the camp would have been killed. Instead, he bribed the Germans to obtain legal permits for an additional 400 Jews, which were mostly given to the wives and children of current residents. Many of the Slovak Jews, not knowing what to expect, had lingered in the ghetto while packing their bags. About 215 to 500 Jews were shot and killed by the Ukrainians and Germans while the houses were being cleared. Between 2,000 and 2,500 people were deported to Treblinka extermination camp; mostly the Slovaks. Members of the , Jewish police, and their families, about 100 in total, were retained to clean up the ghetto. Perhaps another 100 Jews were hiding without permission in the ghetto. On 28 October, the remaining Jews were sent to the Schultz labor camp, and the ghetto was officially liquidated. Either on that day or within the next few weeks, 1,000 people were removed from the labor camps, including the 200 workers at Dƒôblin Fortress and 200 to 500 of the Luftwaffe's workers. They were deported to Ko≈Ñskowola or Treblinka. After this, Farkash estimates that there were about 1,400 Jews were still alive in the labor camps around Irena. Estimates of the number at the Luftwaffe camp range from 1,000 to 2,000, with another 300 at a railway camp near the passenger station, and 120 at another camp near the railway loading station. During May or July 1943, most of the remaining prisoners in the railway camps were deported to Poniatowa concentration camp via the transit ghetto in Ko≈Ñskowola; the rest were deported in late 1943. Hundreds of Jews were still alive in the remaining labor camps in Pu≈Çawy County, but they were murdered during Operation Harvest Festival (2‚Äì3 November 1943). This operation also killed the prisoners of Poniatowa but did not affect the Jews at the Luftwaffe camp in Irena, who were unaware of it. Following Operation Harvest Festival, there were ten labor camps for Jews in the Lublin District with more than 10,000 Jews still alive.  Luftwaffe camp  =Camp leader= Luftwaffe soldiers from Dƒôblin compete in a 4 √ó 100 meters relay (330 ft), August 1940 Polish Air Force Academy in Dƒôblin, 1947 The camp leader () at the Luftwaffe camp was Hermann Wenkert, a Jewish lawyer from Vienna who had been deported to Opole in 1941 and came to Irena with the volunteers. According to Wenkert's account, soon after his arrival he happened upon Eduard Bromofsky, an Austrian Luftwaffe officer with whom Wenkert had served during World War I. Bromofsky convinced the commander of the camp to promote Wenkert to his position. Even after Bromofsky was reassigned, the relationships that Wenkert had cultivated with the German authorities enabled him to retain his position. Wenkert populated the administration with other Viennese Jews, insisted on extra rations for himself and his family, and had his family transferred from Opole to Irena. Because of his close association with the German authorities and use of his position for personal benefit, some survivors considered him to be a collaborator. When it was possible, Wenkert negotiated with the authorities and paid bribes to avoid punishment; he also consulted respected prisoners in cases where the matter had not come to German attention. However, when he thought there was no other option and the survival of the camp was in the balance, Wenkert turned Jews accused of wrongdoing over to the Germans even though he knew that this would result in their deaths. In general, German- speaking Jews had a more positive impression of him than the local Jews, who spoke Yiddish. According to Silberklang, both views of Wenkert may be true: that he tried to secure benefits for himself personally while also working to keep the other Jewish prisoners alive. =Conditions= Conditions were relatively good compared to other camps. Residents received food rations of about 1,700 kilocalories daily (enough to live), weekly baths, and medical care, and were allowed to practice their religion. The presence of 100 young children‚Äîwhose existence was justified as increasing the productivity of their parents‚Äîwas particularly unusual and not matched elsewhere in the Lublin District after Operation Harvest Festival. Aida Milgroijm-Citronbojm continued the Polish-language school that she had run in the ghetto. The SS, who did not know about the children's existence, periodically conducted surprise inspections of the camp, during which the children had to hide. According to Farkash, Wenkert's positive relationship with the camp command was partially responsible for the good conditions. Wenkert managed to get religious Jews exempted from working on Shabbat and allowed a chevra kadisha society to operate, burying the dead according to Jewish law. In 1943, about 80 Jews (including Wenkert) received kosher food for the week of Passover. The camp had three German commanders, all at the rank of sergeant major: Kattengel (through March 1943), Dusy, and Rademacher (during the last two months). Although Kattengel was distrusted because he roamed the camp with a dog and whip, both Dusy and Rademacher were described positively by survivors. Dusy even arranged for one woman to receive treatment at a German hospital after she was badly injured. Wiszniewski, a local , was the lead foreman of the Jewish laborers and did not mistreat them. Autheried engineer Kozak brought food to the Jews he worked with. The Slovak Jews at the camp were the last major group to survive of the almost 40,000 Slovak Jews deported to the Lublin District in 1942. The Jews remaining in Pre≈°ov hired couriers (non-Jews from the Polish‚ÄìSlovak border) to travel to the camp regularly until it was dissolved, carrying letters and bringing valuables and money. A committee was formed in the camp to distribute these among the Slovak Jews. Cases of theft by Polish Jews led to friction between the two communities. Despite the relatively good conditions, some Jews tried to escape because they feared that the camp would be liquidated. The Luftwaffe camp command imposed collective punishment to deter escapees. Both theft and possessing foreign currency were punishable by hanging. Punishment could be excessive and arbitrary‚Äînine Jews were executed by firing squad for causing a fire, even though the fire was accidental‚Äîbut less so than other Nazi camps. According to a 1943 Home Army report, the local ethnic Polish population was hostile to Jewish fugitives. The Home Army itself accused Jews of joining Communist partisan groups and stealing from ethnic Polish peasants. According to Farkash, in 1943, Wenkert allowed a group of Jewish partisans seeking refuge from a hostile unit of the Polish Home Army resistance group into the camp. Most Jews who tried to escape were captured, and others returned to the camp. Several members of the Kowalczyk family were honored as Righteous Among the Nations for sheltering Jews who had escaped from the camp on their farm in . √Årp√°d Szab√≥, a Hungarian military doctor, was similarly recognized for smuggling a Slovak Jewish couple to Hungary. =Liquidation= Memorial plaque at the former HASAG camp in Czƒôstochowa The camp was liquidated on 22 July 1944, the same day that the Red Army reached Lublin. At the time of the deportation, some 800 to 900 Jews were still alive, of whom 400 to 600 were from Dƒôblin or Irena, 40 from Vienna, and 70 to 80 from Slovakia. Two or three transports departed from Irena on 17 and 22 July. (Silberklang reports a third on 20 July). Since no one was willing to volunteer, the first transport carried about 200 people who had few connections in the camp, including single adults and fifteen children between three and six years of age. On the orders of camp security officer Georg Bartenschlager, the fifteen children were shot and killed upon their arrival in Czƒôstochowa. The rest of the prisoners, including Wenkert and 33 young children, departed on the second transport with Rademacher, the German camp commander, who carried a letter of protection from the airfield commander. About fifty Jews escaped from the camp during the evacuation, but most were killed. The second transport arrived in Czƒôstochowa on 25 July; the young children were kept separated for two and a half days but were not killed. The reason for this is not clear, but likely involved negotiations with Bartenschlager. In Czƒôstochowa, the Jews worked at the four Hugo Schneider AG plants. Some were deported to Buchenwald and Bergen-Belsen in January 1945 while others were liberated by the Red Army. About half survived. According to Farkash, the airfield camp in Irena is a \\"singular case\\" in the Lublin district and possibly in the entirety of occupied Poland. One unusual aspect of the camp was that it was run from start to finish by the Luftwaffe rather than the SS, although during 1943 and 1944, the SS tried to expand its role. According to Silberklang, being run by the Wehrmacht helped to ensure the camp's survival. However, other camps (such as three in Zamo≈õƒá county) were run by the Luftwaffe and were still liquidated before the end of 1943. Another reason was the importance of Jewish workers at Dƒôblin to the German war effort, which was continually emphasized by Wenkert in his dealings with the Germans. Overall, luck played a major role in the fortuitous combination of Jewish leadership, relatively friendly Germans, and the evacuation of the camp to Czƒôstochowa rather than Auschwitz-Birkenau. Ninety-nine percent of the Jews from Lublin District were killed in the Holocaust, but hundreds from Dƒôblin and Irena survived the war.  Aftermath  Dƒôblin was liberated by the 1st Polish Army by 27 July 1944. In 1945, Alfred Brandt was convicted and sentenced to death for his crimes by a Soviet military tribunal near S≈Çupsk and executed by firing squad. Some of the Jewish survivors, who attempted to return home in January 1945, were told by the local Milicja Obywatelska police chief that it was illegal for them to settle in the town. In March 1945, survivors ≈Åaja, Gitla and Fryda Luksemburg were murdered with the involvement of local police. Ester Kaminska suffered repeated harassment and extortion from local ethnic Poles, one of whom had obtained her family's bakery from the Nazis, which led to her departure to Palestine in 1947. Other Jews received threatening letters. By 1947, no Jews remained in the town, which is still the case in the twenty-first century. , the was in poor condition and being considered for demolition. A memorial plaque was unveiled in 2015. Ignaz Bubis, a former prisoner of the ghetto, was the chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany from 1992 to 1999.

Her most well known accomplishment was hiding a Jewish woman and her two grandchildren from German forces and arranging their safe passage to relatives in the south of France. For this, in 1990, she was recognized as \\"Righteous Among the Nations\\" by the Yad Vashem Institute in Israel.  Resistance activist  At the risk of her life, Charpentier worked with the Resistance in German-occupied Rennes. Her activities were known to include: distributing leaflets with the help of Dr. Menon who died in the Allied bombardment of May 1943; saving a young Polish couple from deportation; and helping young people escape compulsory labor service in by administering drugs to them just before their evaluation by German doctors. = Rescue = In 1943, while serving as a social worker in the Rennes office for assistance to families of prisoners of war, she received a visit from an elderly woman, Malka Engelstein, who tearfully told the story about her Jewish family, originally from Poland, who had settled in Metz in eastern France in the early 20th century. Early in World War II, her son Joseph Engelstein, who had been serving in the French army, was captured by German forces and was a prisoner of war. When Germany annexed France in 1940, the remaining family members (Mrs. Malka Engelstein, her husband Fishel, their daughter-in-law, and her two young children) fled Metz and took refuge in Rennes, western France. However, on this day in 1943, Gestapo agents appeared at their house, ransacked everything and took away the grandfather Fishel as well as her daughter-in- law, and threatened to return for the grandmother and her grandchildren. Charpentier immediately left with the grandmother to find the two young children: Catherine Engelstein, three years old, and her two-year-old brother Raymond and promptly removed them from the house. (She learned later that the Gestapo agents had returned, in vain, to take the three remaining family members.) Charpentier took the three Jews to a friend's farm about fifteen kilometers from Rennes. The farmer agreed to temporarily house them, but only on the condition that Charpentier take full responsibility for their needs. The three refugees lived on the farm for about a month and every day, Charpentier's brother brought them food with the help of two friends. Looking for a more lasting and safer solution, Charpentier decided to send them to others active in the Resistance in Paris, and organized their departure, with the help of Archbishop Cl√©ment Roques. Mrs. Engelstein did not speak French and was unable to pose as a French citizen so she assumed the role of a deaf woman accompanied by the two children. The group was escorted by two young people who wanted to join the forces of General de Gaulle in North Africa. As their journey proceeded, Charpentier impatiently waited for the arrival of the telegram with the agreed code signaling trip completion; it finally came, \\"the five rabbits have arrived.\\" Once safe in Paris, members of the clandestine network safely transferred the three Jews to Mrs. Engelstein's relatives in the south of France. = Reunion = Mrs. Engelstein and the children survived their ordeals, but Grandfather Fishel Engelstein died on the train to Auschwitz. The daughter-in-law, who had been captured by the Germans, survived the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in northern Germany and returned to France at the end of the war, but she was reportedly \\"physically and morally broken.\\" She had the joy of finding her husband and children alive, and even went to see Charpentier to thank her for saving her little ones. However, she never recovered from the horrors she suffered during the war and died five years later. In 1989, Marie-Louise Charpentier experienced \\"the great joy of meeting Catherine,‚Äù the grown woman nearing 60 who had once been the three- year-old girl she had helped save.  Award  In 1990, Charpentier was given the title of \\"Righteous among the Nations\\" by the Yad Vashem organization in Israel, which created the award to \\"recognize non-Jews who, at personal risk and without a financial or evangelistic motive, chose to save Jews from the ongoing genocide during the Holocaust.\\" She was the first person in Ille-et- Vilaine, France to receive this title. The award includes the inscription, \\"Whoever saves a life saves the entire universe.‚Äù Her name appears on the Yad Vashem Wall of the Righteous in Jerusalem.  Personal life  Marie-Louise Charpentier was the youngest in a family of nine children living in Rennes, France, born on 26 November 1905. She received her diploma in nursing before becoming a social worker. Charpentier adopted three children. Retelling the story of his adoptive mother, her son Xavier-Vincent Decq-Charpentier, 56 years old, recalled in a 2003 interview that she \\"had asked nothing.\\" He went on to quote a text written by Lily, \\"our commitment was so obvious due to our rebelliousness against injustice and also because of our patriotism, that it never occurred to any of us that our actions were worth talking about, each success bringing its sufficient reward in itself.\\" She died in Rennes on 24 June 1998 at 93.

Historically, the town was one of five neighboring communities (along with Brooklyn, Curtis Bay, Fairfield and Wagner's Point) sought and ultimately annexed by Baltimore City from Anne Arundel County in 1918. The town was razed in its entirety in the 1950s, to accommodate the expansion of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad's Curtis Bay terminal. The site of the former community is now primarily occupied by the Harbor Tunnel Thruway (part of Interstate 895). Etymology According to one source, the name Masonville is attributed to an early resident named Mason, who established a workshop producing crackers and bread there. History =Foundation to Annexation= The town that would be Masonville was founded in the 1890s, centered on what was then Ninth Street & Chesapeake Avenue, directly adjacent to the newly- expanded lines of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad's (B&O;) Curtis Bay Branch. Along with other communities bordering the Patapsco River, Anne Arundel County extended electric light to the town in 1902. A new Methodist Episcopal Church, was dedicated in 1903 at a cost of $3000 (). A small fundamentalist church and related school were also established about this time. Masonville & neighboring Brooklyn in 1907 Despite its small size, Masonville boasted its own saloon, and, along with its neighboring settlements, was one of the few \\"wet\\" areas in Anne Arundel County as prohibition was gathering strength. From at least 1910, Masonville also supported an amateur sports team, the Masonville Country Club (also known as Masonville Athletic Club), which competed in intra-city baseball and basketball. Around 1915, Masonville benefited as a hub from the increased rail traffic toward Curtis Bay and Fairfield, where the oil industry in both places was experiencing boom growth. The Masonville B&O; yard became a large storage site for the hundreds of tanker cars needed to supply this industry. 25 acres near the town were used to store cars for wheat as well, and demand on the railroad branch (the sole line that serviced the peninsula) was to only increase with the commencement of construction of the B&O;'s enormous coal pier in Curtis Bay in 1916. So rapid was the railroad's expansion that it had to house 75 of its workers at Masonville in converted railcars rather than homes. By 1917, the B&O;'s yard at Masonville had grown to nearly 50 acres. Plans for a proper sewer system, which had not previously existed outside of neighboring Brooklyn, were finally initiated by the county in 1916. Citizens of Masonville, along with their neighbors, complained of what they perceived as the lawlessness coming from the many saloons directly adjacent to - but not under the jurisdiction or regulation of - Baltimore City itself. These citizens formed a Home Defenders League to demand action be taken against these taverns and resorts, which catered to Baltimore residents. Arguing World War I made it a national security issue, the Home Defenders League advocated the creation of areas of alcohol prohibition around the growing industrial areas on the peninsula. Masonville's proximity to the growing Baltimore City invited consideration of its annexation nearly from its founding. The Brooklyn Improvement Association had proposed a bill to annex Brooklyn & Masonville to Baltimore City as early as 1910. Among the two communities, 81% of respondents supported being annexed, with supporters complaining of the currently inadequate water supply, fire services and road maintenance provided by the county. A 1914 fire for instance destroyed seven Masonville homes, and endangered the entire neighborhood, due to a lack of water for fire fighting, followed by another uncontrolled fire that destroyed a further four homes two months later. Residents also complained that the county's contractor for sanitation failed to collect the town's garbage even weekly, let alone biweekly as the contract had required. Masonville was included in Baltimore City's initial 1916 proposed annexation map, and was included within the portion of Anne Arundel County ultimately annexed by the legislation passed in March 1918. =Demolition and Redevelopment= In the early 1950s, the same railroad that had been the cause of its creation also became the cause of its destruction, as the town was razed to accommodate the expansion of the B&O;'s Curtis Bay terminal. The railroad sought to avoid antiquated and dangerous underpasses and at-grade crossings, and the required land required the purchasing of the land under the town by B&O;, who in turn deeded it to Baltimore city for demolition and redevelopment. The last buildings were destroyed to make way for the Harbor Tunnel Thruway in 1957. The remaining land north of the railroad yards remained in the hands of the Arundel Corporation for many years, which operated a dump at the site. Beginning in 1976, the State of Maryland pursued plans for an ambitious 250-acre redevelopment of the waterfront at Masonville as a new marine terminal, and two years later, the Maryland Port Authority purchased the requisite land from the Arundel Corporation Within the year, the land was being partly used for storage of excess automobile freight. When development of the new container terminal failed to materialize over the next decade, the port authority began plans to semi-permanently lease a third of the territory to auto importers. =Environmental Education Center= Beginning in 1998, local residents and environmental groups began to argue for the protection of what had become an \\"accidental wildlife refuge\\" by turning Masonville Cove into a nature park. The State of Maryland committed in 2007 to a $130 million clean up of 100 acres of the Masonville site, which included the removal of thousands of tons of debris and 27 abandoned vessels. The redevelopment of Masonville Cove was to include a park with hiking trails, a nature center and an artificial oyster reef. Students from Curtis Bay Elementary School unveil the Masonville Cove Urban Wildlife Refuge Partnership sign along with partners. In 2008, the state broke ground on the Masonville Cove Environmental Education Center. Designed and built by Baltimore Green Construction, the Center is a \\"Near-Zero Net Energy Building\\", designed to consume 75% less energy than a standard commercial building of its size. The Center was opened by Lt. Governor Anthony Brown on Earth Day of 2009, and is now open for educational programs. Demographics According to an 1893 account, Masonville consisted of 51 homes, with a population of 218 (66 men, 51 boys, 56 women, 45 girls), all of whom were recorded as white. By 1910, the population had grown to 400 people, living in about 100 houses.

It serves as a boundary and main commercial street for several North Portland neighborhoods. Route description Lombard Street begins at the entrance to Kelley Point Park, near the confluence of the Columbia and Willamette Rivers. From here, it crosses the Columbia Slough and briefly runs southwest before turning south, serving as a primary industrial arterial. It then crosses above a railroad junction which serves that industrial area, briefly continues as Burgard Road, then turns southeast and continues again as Lombard. It passes Schnitzer Steel and Pier Park before continuing into Downtown St. Johns as the main commercial street. At the end of that section, it crosses an intersection with Richmond Avenue, at which point it takes over the U.S. Route 30 Bypass (US 30 Byp.) designation. Lombard continues as a primarily commercial street through several neighborhoods (listed below). Lombard turns slightly as it passes Columbia Park and continues east. It crosses Interstate Avenue (OR 99W). It then passes over Interstate 5 (I-5), providing access to the freeway via a half-cloverleaf interchange. Next, it crosses OR 99E (Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard), at which point it becomes a primarily industrial thoroughfare, employing interchanges for all but one of its four-way crossings. At its intersection with NE 10th Avenue, it turns southeast and continues until its intersection with NE 46th Avenue, at which point the street's designation as Lombard ends and it continues as NE Portland Highway. =Neighborhoods and districts served= * Rivergate Industrial District, from the Columbia Slough to Burgard Road. * St Johns, including the Rivergate Industrial District, to the North Portland Railroad Cut. * Portsmouth, from the North Portland Railroad Cut to N Chautauqua Boulevard, serving as the neighborhood's southern boundary. * University Park, from the North Portland Railroad Cut to N Chautauqua Boulevard, serving as the neighborhood's northern boundary. * Kenton, from N Chautauqua Boulevard to Interstate 5 (I-5), serving as the neighborhood's southern boundary. * Arbor Lodge, from N Chautauqua Boulevard to Interstate 5 (I-5), serving as the neighborhood's northern boundary. * Piedmont, from Interstate 5 (I-5) to NE Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. * Woodlawn, from NE Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to NE 22nd Avenue. * Concordia, from NE 22nd Avenue to NE 42nd Avenue. * Cully, from NE 42nd Avenue to Lombard's connection to NE Portland Highway. Transportation Electric trolley on Lombard, 1904 Several radial TriMet bus lines serve portions of Lombard Street. * Line 4 runs between Downtown Portland and St. Johns with stops on two segments of Lombard: between N St. Louis and N Richmond Avenue, and between N Denver and N Albina Avenue. It provides a connection to the MAX Yellow Line at the North Lombard Transit Center. * Line 16 runs between Downtown Portland and Sauvie Island, with stops on Lombard between N St. Louis and N Richmond Avenue. * Line 35 runs between Oregon City and University of Portland, with stops on Lombard between N Portsmouth Avenue and N Greeley Avenue. * Line 44 runs between Portland Community College's Sylvania campus and Pier Park, with stops on Lombard between the park and N Richmond Avenue. * Line 75 runs between Milwaukie and St. Johns, with stops on Lombard from Pier Park to N Williams Avenue. It also provides a MAX connection at the North Lombard Transit Center. History Building at 4786 N Lombard, 1909 Lombard Street holds several different historical names because of North Portland's history as a series of smaller communities that were annexed by Portland. In Kenton and Albina, it was named Pippin Street. In Portsmouth, it was named Dawson Street. As the main street of St. Johns' commercial core, it was named Jersey Street. Historically, Lombard Street was home to a large segment of streetcar line 474, which ran from Albina to St. Johns between 1888 and 1937. The Kenton Stockyard line also traveled up a portion of Lombard between 1909 and 1928. Rail still exists under the asphalt in some parts of the street, including some slated for removal by the Portland Bureau of Transportation in plans for the N Lombard Main Street renewal project. Events The St. Johns Parade has been held annually for over 50 years, and uses Lombard between N Burr Avenue and Downtown St. Johns as the main part of its route.

Significant draft avoidance was taking place even before the U.S. became heavily involved in the Vietnam War. The large cohort of Baby Boomers allowed for a steep increase in the number of exemptions and deferments, especially for college and graduate students. According to peace studies scholar David Cortright, more than half of the 27 million men eligible for the draft during the Vietnam War were deferred, exempted, or disqualified.  Evasion in Australia and the United States  =Significance= The number of draft resisters in the United States was notably significant. According to Cortright, \\"Distinct from the millions who [avoided] the draft were the many thousands who resisted the conscription system and actively opposed the war\\".Cortright (2005), cited above, p. 164. The head of U.S. President Richard Nixon's task force on the all-volunteer military reported in 1970 that the number of resisters was \\"expanding at an alarming rate\\" and that the government was \\"almost powerless to apprehend and prosecute them\\".Cortright (2005), cited above, p. 165 (quoting task force chair Martin Anderson). It is now known that, during the Vietnam era, approximately 570,000 young men were classified as draft offenders, and approximately 210,000 were formally accused of draft violations; however, only 8,750 were convicted and only 3,250 were jailed. Some draft eligible men publicly burned their draft cards, but the Justice Department brought charges against only 50, of whom 40 were convicted.Baskir and Strauss (1987), cited above. In 1964 Australia enacted a draft for soldiers to send to Vietnam. From 1966-68 a growing force of conscientious objectors grew in Australia and by 1967 became openly popular due to a growing protest movement. Information campaigns were carried out by organizations like Students for a Democratic Society and Save Our Sons to spread information on how to avoid the draft. =Enlisting to evade= As U.S. troop strength in Vietnam increased, some young men sought to evade the draft by pro-actively enlisting in military forces that were unlikely to see combat in Vietnam. For example, conscription scholars Lawrence Baskir and William Strauss say that the Coast Guard may have served that purpose for some,Baskir and Strauss, cited above, p. 54. though they also point out that Coast Guardsmen had to maintain readiness for combat in Vietnam,Baskir and Strauss, cited above, p. 14. and that some Coast Guardsmen eventually served and were killed there. Similarly, the Vietnam-era National Guard was seen by some as an avenue for avoiding combat in Vietnam,Baskir and Strauss, cited above, p. 51 although that too was less than foolproof: about 15,000 National Guardsmen were sent to Vietnam before the war began winding down. Phil Ochs (1940‚Äì1976) was one of several countercultural figures to encourage draft evasion. =Evasion counseling= Other young men sought to evade the draft by avoiding or resisting any military commitment. In this they were bolstered by certain countercultural figures. \\"Draft Dodger Rag\\", a 1965 song by Phil Ochs, circumvented laws against counseling evasion by employing satire to provide a how-to list of available deferments: ruptured spleen, poor eyesight, flat feet, asthma, and many more.Ochs, Phil (1965). \\" Draft Dodger Rag\\".

A Cultural History of the Radical Sixties in the San Francisco Bay Area. New York: Routledge, pp. 127‚Äì128. . The insignia of the organization was the Greek letter omega, Œ©, the symbol for ohms‚Äîthe unit of electrical resistance. Members of The Resistance publicly burned their draft cards or refused to register for the draft. Other members deposited their cards into boxes on selected dates and then mailed them to the government. They were then drafted, refused to be inducted, and fought their cases in the federal courts. These draft resisters hoped that their public civil disobedience would help to bring the war and the draft to an end. Many young men went to federal prison as part of this movement. According to Cortright, the draft resistance movement was the leading edge of the anti-war movement in 1967 and 1968. After the war, some of the draft evaders who stayed in the U.S. wrote memoirs.

It remains a matter of debate whether emigration to Canada and elsewhere during the Vietnam War was an effective, or even a genuine, war resistance strategy.

Born in the Fukushima prefecture, he served in the Imperial Japanese Army and the Republic of China Armed Forces. He was awarded the Order of the Golden Kite (3rd Class). When Japan surrendered in World War II, he served as the commanding officer of the garrison in Mengjiang (modern-day Inner Mongolia). Under the attack of the Soviet army, he still resisted, protecting 40,000 Japanese nationals stranded near Zhangjiakou in Inner Mongolia. In 1949 he secretly sailed to Taiwan and served as a personal adviser to Tang Enbo. He assisted in directing the Kinmen campaign in Kinmen and Xiamen. In the end, the Republic of China Armed Forces successfully defeated the People's Liberation Army.  Biography  = Birth and Education = He was born in the village of Niida, Iwase district, Fukushima (nowadays part of Sukagawa). Born in a farming family, his father worked in the village government. His brother was a counselor in his village council. In 1904, he entered the Sendai Army Youth Academy, and graduated at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy 7 years later, ranked 13th among 509 students. In 1922, he graduated at the Army War College, ranked 9th among 60. = As a field officer = Upon graduation in the Army War College, he served in the Imperial Japanese Army, specializing in Chinese affairs. During the Nanjing Incident of 1927, he stationed at the consulate-general of Japan in Nanjing where he was attacked by the soldiers of the Northern Expedition and even injured by a bayonet. In order to escape, he jumped off from the second floor and was severely injured. He was rescued in time and survived. After the Huanggutun incident took place in June 1928, he began to specialize in solving the Manchuria-Mongolia problem, conducting research and proposing plans for the nation. Later, he joined a group led by Kanji Ishiwara, Teiichi Suzuki, Keisaku Murakami, Akira Mut≈ç and composing mainly of youth officers. In May 1929, the group aimed at military reform and personnel refreshment, separation of commanding power from state affairs, and establishment of a legitimate national general mobilization system. In August 1930, Nemoto was promoted to lieutenant colonel and became the leader of the Shina section. In September 1930, he joined the secret association Sakurakai, which aimed at reforming Japan. In March 1931, he was involved in the March and October Incidents, being punished and ignored as a result. Before the February 26 incident occurred in 1936, he was the news leader in the Ground Army of Imperial Japan. He intended to take part in the event, but he was drunk in the previous night and hence did not take part. After the reform of the ground forces, he returned to his original group and became to group leader. When the second Sino-Japanese war took place, he returned to his initial job of specializing in China affairs. Until Japan had surrendered, he had held various titles, including (but not limited to) the Chief of Staff and Commander. = As Commander in Mongolia = Nemoto was appointed commander of the army in Mongolia in November 1944. In August 1945, the Soviet-Japanese War broke out, and the Soviet army began to invade Manchuria. After the Japanese surrender on the 15th of the month, the Soviet Red Army showed no sign of ceasing the attack. In order to protect the 40,000 Japanese immigrants stranded in the area, he issued this order to the Japanese defense team:ÁêÜÁî±„ÅÆÂ¶Ç‰Ωï„ÇíÂïè„Çè„Åö„ÄÅÈô£Âú∞„Å´‰æµÂÖ•„Åô„Çã„ÇΩËªç„ÅØÊñ∑‰πé‰πã„ÇíÊíÉÊªÖ„Åô„Åπ„Åó„ÄÇÊ≠§„Çå„Å´Â∞ç„Åô„ÇãË≤¨‰ªª„ÅØ‰∏ÄÂàáÂè∏‰ª§ÂÆò„ÅåË≤†„ÅÜ„ÄÇ During the desperate guarding of the trains and routes used by civilians, several attempts were made to negotiate a ceasefire with the Soviets. Under the non-stop attack of the Soviet army, he carried out a close-range combat. After the Eighth Route Army of the Chinese Communist Party also came to help the Soviets, Nemoto fought more vigorously to block the attacks.The main force of the Soviet army was concentrated in Manzhou, and there were not many troops in Inner Mongolia. Under these favorable conditions, the Japanese civilians were able to successfully evacuate. Because of the assistance of the national army in the operation of evacuating 40,000 Japanese, it was possible to treat Chiang Kai- shek as a benefactor. He was anxious to have the opportunity to return and plant In the future, I was invited to participate in the war of chance. For more detailed information, please refer to the Japanese-Soviet War entry. On August 19, Nemoto fought a three-day battle with the Soviet army. The Japanese army fought back under the command of Nemoto, and the Soviet army lost its fighting spirit. Therefore, the Japanese army began to retreat on August 21, and the last team returned to within the Great Wall on August 27. The Chief of Staff of the Mongolian Army who came to greet him was in tears, and thanked Nemoto for saving 40,000 Japanese civilians he could not have saved. On the other hand, the 40,000 civilians who fled from Inner Mongolia on August 20 arrived in Tianjin after a three-day trek, and boarded a ship to return to Japan. In August 1946, as the top person in charge, after the return of the Japanese who were stranded in China and the demobilization of 350,000 soldiers from the North China Army, Nemoto finally returned to Japan. = Taiwan =  Secret transport  After demobilization, he returned to his home in Tsurukawa, Tokyo. In view of the fact that Kuomintang would lose control over China, after Chiang Kai-shek resigned as president in January 1949, he pawned some goods and sold some of his belongings as a ferry fee for Chiang. Under the support of others, he set sail for Taiwan. A shipwreck occurred on the way, but Nemoto was rescued by the US military. The US military provided some money and sent a Japanese-born American officer to accompany. On 26 June 1949 of the same year, they sailed to Taiwan from the coast of Nobeoka, Miyazaki Prefecture. Arriving in Keelung on July 10, the local gendarmerie and police officers were unaware of the situation, so the people who sailed on the ship were imprisoned. Later, after the report of Nemoto's imprisonment was transmitted to the upper ranks of the National Army (Lieutenant General Peng Mengqi and Lieutenant General Niu Xianming), their treatment was immediately changed. They were moved to Beitou Hot Springs in Taipei to rest on August 1. In mid-August, Tang Enbo coordinated and met with Chiang. On August 5 of the same year, the United States Government indicated to the Kuomintang that military assistance would be suspended, and Chiang Kai-shek accepted the assistance of Nemoto and others. Some sources indicate that Nemoto's cause of moving to Taiwan included not only gratefulness towards Chiang, but also a will to show off his talents.„ÄÇ  Battle at Kinmen  Nemoto was transferred from Taiwan to Xiamen on August 18, under the pseudonym \\"Lin Baoyuan\\" (\\"Yuan\\", meaning \\"the root\\") and was appointed Lieutenant General. Tang Enbo treated him with courtesy, and called him \\"Consultant of the Advisor\\" in Japanese. Due to the successive defeats of the Kuomintang army in the battlefields of mainland China, Nemoto suggested to Tang that the army retreat to the Zhoushan Islands, Yijiangshan, Dachen Island, Kinmen and Matsu Islands, stretch the front line with the Communist army, protect Taiwan and Penghu Islands, and wait for the opportunity to counterattack. The plan obtained the affirmation of Chiang. On October 1 in the San me year, the Communist Party of China established the People's Republic of China. Soon, Xiamen fell out of Kuomintang's control, and the Kuomintang army had to fight on Kinmen Island, and Nemoto also set out to plan a trench battle. From On the following October 24, Nemoto assisted in commanding the Battle of Guningtou on Kinmen Island, using tanks to shoot PLA vessels to cut off the PLA's retreat, annihilating the incoming Chinese People's Liberation Army. He successfully defended Kinmen, and was dubbed \\"God of War\\". After the victory at Kinmen, he participated in the education and training activities of the Kuomintang Army. The day before Nemoto left Taiwan in 1952, in order to express his gratitude, Chiang opened a pair of special vases he had collected and presented one of them to Nemoto. The vases originally consisted of six (three pairs). They were specially made for Chiang in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi in 1947. One of them was given to Queen Elizabeth of England as a wedding gift, and another was given to the Emperor Showa of Japan, leaving himself just one pair.Ëî£‰∏≠Ê≠£Ë¥àÊó•ÂèãÊÉÖËä±Áì∂Â∞áËøîÂè∞Ëî£Ë®ÇË£ΩÂÖ≠Âè™Ëä±Áì∂ ÂÖ©Â∞çÂàÜÈÄÅËã±Êó•ÁöáÂÆ§  Media coverage  At that time, the general convener of the Kuomintang and the Paidan in Japan, Yasuji Okamura, considered recruiting the Japanese army to defend the attack of the People's Republic of China again. Later, it was widely reported by the international media under the name \\"Taiwan Recruitment Issue\\", which aroused the attention of the Allied Command in Japan and declared abortion. Japan‚Äôs secret ferry to Taiwan was also questioned by the Japanese parliament. At the time, the prime minister of Japan, Shigeru Yoshida, was ambiguous when he answered questions in the parliament. Because of the incident, the Paidan was dissatisfied with Nemoto, so Nemoto was not allowed to join. = Later years = On June 25, 1952, he returned to Japan on a flight by the Civil Air Transport (CAT). He was punished without prosecution for the incident of the secret sail three years ago. Later, he lived in his home in Tsurukawa. On May 5, 1966, after the first holiday when his grandson was born, he was admitted to the hospital because his health deteriorated. He was discharged from hospital on the 21st of the same month, but died suddenly on the 24th, at the age of 74. = After death = At that time, the news of the Nemoto going to Taiwan was top-secret because of the political situation after the Kuomintang took over Taiwan, and because of this, the historical existence and even the existence of the Japanese assistance in the battle of Guningtou was not known to the Taiwanese at that time. = 60th anniversary of the Battle of Guningtou = At the memorial service for the dead in the Battle of Guningtou held in October 2009, several Japanese military members and advisory families were invited by the Republic of China government and met with President Ma Ying-jeou of the Republic of China.„ÄåÊó•Ëªç‰∫ãÈ°ßÂïèË≤¢ÁçªÂÖ•Âè≤Ôºü ÂúãÈò≤ÈÉ®Êú™Ë©ïË´ñ„ÄçËá™Áî±ÊôÇÂ†± 2011Âπ¥5Êúà30Êó• \\"...ÂúãÈò≤ÈÉ®Âú®‰∫å‚óã‚óã‰πùÂπ¥ÂçÅÊúàÊõæËàâËæ¶Âè§ÂØßÈ†≠Â§ßÊç∑Á¥ÄÂøµÂ§ßÊúÉÔºåÊó•Êú¨Ëªç‰∫ãÈ°ßÂïèÂæå‰ª£ÂêâÊùëÂãùË°åÁ≠â‰∫∫ÊáâÈÇÄÂèÉËàáÂ§ßÊúÉÔºåÈ¶¨Ëã±‰πùÁ∏ΩÁµ±‰πüÂêëÂêâÊùëÂãùË°åÁ≠â‰∫∫Êè°ÊâãËá¥ÊÑèÔºåÊôÇ‰ªªÂúãÈò≤ÈÉ®Â∏∏ÂãôÊ¨°Èï∑ÁöÑÈªÉÂ•ïÁÇ≥‰∏≠Â∞á‰πü‰ª•Âè§ÂØßÈ†≠Êà∞ÂΩπÁõ∏ÈóúÊõ∏Á±çË¥àÈÄÅÂêâÊùëÂãùË°åÁ≠â„ÄÇ\\" In addition, before their return to Japan, Lieutenant General Huang Yibing, the Deputy Secretary of Defense of the Republic of China, stated in front of the media as \\"the representative of the Ministry of National Defense\\" said: \\"In the Battle of Guningtou in the past, we thank the Japanese friends for their assistance.\\" By then, the government of the Republic of China finally officially announced the participation of the Japanese in the Battle of Guningtou.

Considered one of the most important Arctic research labs in the world, it was the subject of international media attention when it almost closed due to funding cuts by the Canadian Federal Government in 2012.  History  PEARL is located on Ellesmere Island, about 15 km from the Eureka Weather Station in Eureka, Nunavut and about 1,100 km from the North Pole. It is housed in the Ridge Lab building, originally built by the Meteorological Service of Canada in 1992 to hold the Arctic Stratospheric Ozone Observatory (AStrO). Full time AStrO operations ended in 2001 due to government budget cuts. After hearing that the Ridge Lab was in danger of being demolished, Canadian Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Change (CANDAC), a group of university-based climate scientists and government researchers who study the atmosphere over Canada, proposed to take over the facility. CANDAC was able to successfully re-open the facility in 2005 with a grant from the federal Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI). PEARL has operated continuously since 2005.  Funding concerns  = 2012 defunding = From 2005 to 2010, most of the station's $1.5 million per year operating budget came from the nonprofit Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Science (CFCAS), which received more than $100 million in research grants over 10 years from the Canadian federal government. In the 2011 budget, put forward by Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservative government, CFCAS received no funding. A new fund with $35 million over five years was allocated for climate and atmospheric research, the Climate Change and Atmospheric Research Initiative (CCAR). This new fund was administered by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). In 2012, one year after the creation of the $35 million dollar CCAR fund, no money had been released to scientists. In February 2012, with no funding to continue station operations, CANDAC announced PEARL's impending closure. At the same time, the government announced final plans to build a new $204 million federal government Canadian High Arctic Research Station (CHARS) in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut. With an annual budget of $26.5 million, the government said this new facility would be \\"a world-class hub for science and technology in Canada's North.\\" Located about 1200 km south of PEARL, this station is too far south to effectively measure ozone depletion or changes in the arctic atmosphere. The closure of PEARL, along with the closing of the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, provoked an outcry from Canadian and International scientists. Critics pointed our that closing PEARL and opening CHARS made little financial sense, and charged said the new base would be \\"a command and control center for resource extraction and sovereignty.\\" The scientific journal Nature said that the \\"move comes just as data from the fast-changing Arctic climate are most needed\\" and that it \\"is hard to believe that finance is the true reason\\" for the closure. In the month after the announcement, the Canadian public donated $12,000 to help keep the station from closing. Kim Strong, one of the founders of CANDAC, said that while the funds were not enough to keep the station open, the expression of support was \\"quite heartwarming.\\" In 2013, about 20 days before the facility was set to permanently close, the government released last-minute funding from CCAR to save PEARL, allotting $5-million over 5-years. This was about two-thirds of the previous operating budget, and was not enough to keep an operator at the station year-round, meaning that much of the existing equipment had to be automated. In addition, during the 2012 funding cuts the lab lost its trained operators and observations were no longer taken continuously, which reduced researchers' confidence in their data. = Later funding concerns = The lab again faced an uncertain future when CCAR funding ran out in 2017. The new, Liberal government under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau provided $1.6-million in short-term funding for the facility. However, this funding ran out again in September 2019. Canadian scientists have criticized the Trudeau government for not having a more stable source of funding for fundamental climate science.

The theorem can also be formulated so to characterize a local ring (#Characterization of a local ring). For a finite projective module over a commutative local ring, the theorem is an easy consequence of Nakayama's lemma. For the general case, the proof (both the original as well as later one) consists of the following two steps: *Observe that a projective module over an arbitrary ring is a direct sum of countably generated projective modules. *Show that a countably generated projective module over a local ring is free (by a \\"[reminiscence] of the proof of Nakayama's lemma\\"). The idea of the proof of the theorem was also later used by Hyman Bass to show big projective modules (under some mild conditions) are free. According to , Kaplansky's theorem \\"is very likely the inspiration for a major portion of the results\\" in the theory of semiperfect rings.  Proof  The proof of the theorem is based on two lemmas, both of which concern decompositions of modules and are of independent general interest. Proof: Let N be a direct summand; i.e., M = N \\\\oplus L. Using the assumption, we write M = \\\\bigoplus_{I \\\\in I} M_i where each M_i is a countably generated submodule. For each subset A \\\\subset I, we write M_A = \\\\bigoplus_{i \\\\in A} M_i, N_A = the image of M_A under the projection M \\\\to N \\\\hookrightarrow M and L_A the same way. Now, consider the set of all triples (J, B, C) consisting of a subset J \\\\subset I and subsets B, C \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak{F} such that M_J = N_J \\\\oplus L_J and N_J, L_J are the direct sums of the modules in B, C. We give this set a partial ordering such that (J, B, C) \\\\le (J', B', C') if and only if J \\\\subset J', B \\\\subset B', C \\\\subset C'. By Zorn's lemma, the set contains a maximal element (J, B, C). We shall show that J = I; i.e., N = N_J = \\\\bigoplus_{N' \\\\in B} N' \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{F}. Suppose otherwise. Then we can inductively construct a sequence of at most countable subsets I_1 \\\\subset I_2 \\\\subset \\\\cdots \\\\subset I such that I_1 ot\\\\subset J and for each integer n \\\\ge 1, :M_{I_n} \\\\subset N_{I_n} + L_{I_n} \\\\subset M_{I_{n+1}}. Let I' = \\\\bigcup_0^\\\\infty I_n and J' = J \\\\cup I'. We claim: :M_{J'} = N_{J'} \\\\oplus L_{J'}. The inclusion \\\\subset is trivial. Conversely, N_{J'} is the image of N_J + L_J + M_{I'} \\\\subset N_J + M_{I'} and so N_{J'} \\\\subset M_{J'}. The same is also true for L_{J'}. Hence, the claim is valid. Now, N_J is a direct summand of M (since it is a summand of M_J, which is a summand of M); i.e., N_J \\\\oplus M' = M for some M'. Then, by modular law, N_{J'} = N_J \\\\oplus (M' \\\\cap N_{J'}). Set \\\\widetilde{N_J} = M' \\\\cap N_{J'}. Define \\\\widetilde{L_J} in the same way. Then, using the early claim, we have: :M_{J'} = M_J \\\\oplus \\\\widetilde{N_J} \\\\oplus \\\\widetilde{L_J}, which implies that :\\\\widetilde{N_J} \\\\oplus \\\\widetilde{L_J} \\\\simeq M_{J'} / M_J \\\\simeq M_{J' - J} is countably generated as J' - J \\\\subset I'. This contradicts the maximality of (J, B, C). \\\\square Proof: Let \\\\mathcal{G} denote the family of modules that are isomorphic to modules of the form \\\\bigoplus_{i \\\\in F} M_i for some finite subset F \\\\subset I. The assertion is then implied by the following claim: *Given an element x \\\\in N, there exists an H \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G} that contains x and is a direct summand of N. Indeed, assume the claim is valid. Then choose a sequence x_1, x_2, \\\\dots in N that is a generating set. Then using the claim, write N = H_1 \\\\oplus N_1 where x_1 \\\\in H_1 \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G}. Then we write x_2 = y + z where y \\\\in H_1, z \\\\in N_1. We then decompose N_1 = H_2 \\\\oplus N_2 with z \\\\in H_2 \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G}. Note \\\\\\\\{ x_1, x_2 \\\\\\\\} \\\\subset H_1 \\\\oplus H_2. Repeating this argument, in the end, we have: \\\\\\\\{ x_1, x_2, \\\\dots \\\\\\\\} \\\\subset \\\\bigoplus_0^\\\\infty H_n; i.e., N = \\\\bigoplus_0^\\\\infty H_n. Hence, the proof reduces to proving the claim and the claim is a straightforward consequence of Azumaya's theorem (see the linked article for the argument). \\\\square Proof of the theorem: Let N be a projective module over a local ring. Then, by definition, it is a direct summand of some free module F. This F is in the family \\\\mathfrak{F} in Lemma 1; thus, N is a direct sum of countably generated submodules, each a direct summand of F and thus projective. Hence, without loss of generality, we can assume N is countably generated. Then Lemma 2 gives the theorem. \\\\square  Characterization of a local ring  Kaplansky's theorem can be stated in such a way to give a characterization of a local ring. A direct summand is said to be maximal if it has an indecomposable complement. The implication 1\\\\. \\\\Rightarrow 2. is exactly (usual) Kaplansky's theorem and Azumaya's theorem. The converse 2\\\\. \\\\Rightarrow 1. follows from the following general fact, which is interested itself: *A ring R is local \\\\Leftrightarrow for each nonzero proper direct summand M of R^2 = R \\\\times R, either R^2 = (0 \\\\times R) \\\\oplus M or R^2 = (R \\\\times 0) \\\\oplus M. (\\\\Rightarrow) is by Azumaya's theorem as in the proof of 1\\\\. \\\\Rightarrow 2.. Conversely, suppose R^2 has the above property and that an element x in R is given. Consider the linear map \\\\sigma:R^2 \\\\to R, \\\\, \\\\sigma(a, b) = a - b. Set y = x - 1. Then \\\\sigma(x, y) = 1, which is to say \\\\eta: R \\\\to R^2, a \\\\mapsto (ax, ay) splits and the image M is a direct summand of R^2. It follows easily from that the assumption that either x or -y is a unit element. \\\\square  See also  *Krull‚ÄìSchmidt category  Notes   References  H.

The Propylaea was the monumental gateway to the Acropolis of Athens, and was one of several public works commissioned by the Athenian leader Pericles in order to rebuild the Acropolis a generation after the conclusion of the Persian Wars. Pericles appointed his friend Phidias as the supervisor and lead architect of this massive project, which Pericles allegedly financed with funds appropriated from the treasury of the Delian League. According to Plutarch, the Propylaea was designed by the architect Mnesikles, about whom nothing else is known., Plutarch: Pericles 13.7. Construction began in 437 BC and was terminated in 432, when the building was still unfinished. The Propylaea was constructed of white Pentelic marble and gray Eleusinian marble or limestone, which was used only for accents. Structural iron was also used, though William Bell DinsmoorDinsmoor, William Bell (1922), \\"Structural Iron in Greek Architecture,\\" American Journal of Archaeology, XXVI analyzed the structure and concluded that the iron weakened the building. The structure consists of a central building with two adjoining wings on the west (outer) side, one to the north and one to the south. The core is the central building, which presents a standard six-columned Doric fa√ßade both on the west to those entering the Acropolis and on the east to those departing. The columns echo the proportions (not the size) of the columns of the Parthenon. There is no surviving evidence for sculpture in the pediments. The central building contains the gate wall, about two-thirds of the way through it. There are five gates in the wall, one for the central passageway, which was not paved and lay along the natural level of the ground, and two on either side at the level of the building's eastern porch, five steps up from the level of the western portico. The central passageway was the culmination of the Sacred Way, which led to the Acropolis from Eleusis. Entrance into the Acropolis was controlled by the Propylaea. Though it was not built as a fortified structure, it was important that people not ritually clean be denied access to the sanctuary. In addition, runaway slaves and other miscreants could not be permitted into the sanctuary where they could claim the protection of the gods. The state treasury was also kept on the Acropolis, making its security important. The gate wall and the eastern (inner) portion of the building sit at a level five steps above the western portion, and the roof of the central building rose on the same line. The ceiling in the eastern part of the central building was famous in antiquity, having been called by Pausanias (about 600 years after the building was finished) \\"...down to the present day unrivaled.\\" It consisted of marble blocks carved in the shape of ceiling coffers and painted blue with gold stars. The colonnades Western side of the Propylaea The outer (western) wings to the right and left of the central building stood on the same platform as the western portion of the central building but were much smaller, not only in plan but in scale. Like the central building, the wings use Doric colonnades and entablatures. The central building also has an Ionic colonnade on either side of the central passageway between the western (outer) Doric colonnade and the gate wall. This is therefore the first building known to us with Doric and Ionic colonnades visible at the same time. It is also the first monumental building in the classical period to be more complex than a simple rectangle or cylinder. The western wing on the north (to the left as one enters the Acropolis) was famous in antiquity as the location of paintings of important Greek battles. Pausanias reports their presence, but few scholars believe the room was planned to hold them. Recent scholarship, following the lead of John Travlos (Pictorial Dictionary of Ancient Athens, New York, 1971), has taken the northern wing to have been a room for ritual dining. The evidence for that is the off-center doorway and the position near the entrance to the Acropolis. The wing on the south, though much smaller, was clearly designed to make the whole structure appear to be symmetrical. It seems only to have functioned as an access route to the Temple of Athena Nike, which stood to the south and further west, on a raised bastion. Plans for eastern and western side of Propylaea Plan of the Propylaea Pedestal of Agrippa There were two wings planned for the eastern side of the Propylaea, facing in toward the Acropolis. Preparations for both wings are apparent at the eastern end of the central building and along the side walls, but it seems that the plan for a southern wing was abandoned early in the construction process since the old fortification wall was not demolished, as required for that wing. The north wing was not built either. Had it been constructed, it seems that the level of the floor would have been problematic. To the extent that preparations had been made, they were for a floor at the level of the western portion of the building, considerably below the level required on the east. As a result of the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta in 431 BC, the Propylaea was never completed. Not only are the eastern wings missing, the wall surfaces were not trimmed to their finished shapes, and so- called lifting bosses remain on many blocks. (Lifting bosses have long been called such but are now recognized to have been for another purpose, though that other purpose is not agreed. See A. Trevor Hodge, \\"Bosses Reappraised,\\" Omni Pede Stare: Saggi Architettonici e circumvesuviani in memoriam Jos de Waele, 2005, Mols & Moormann, eds.) Later history The extant monumental marble stairway was built in the Claudian period, circa 52 AD, which replaced the zigzag ramp of Mnesicles,Gorham P. Stevens, Architectural Studies Concerning the Acropolis of Athens, Hesperia, Vol. 15, No. 2, 1946, p.92. and following the Herulian invasion the Buel√© Gate was constructed immediately in front of the Propylaia as a part of the further fortification of the citadel and the city. Travlos, p.483 During the period of the Duchy of Athens, it served as the palace of the Acciaioli family, who ruled the duchy from 1388 to 1458. It was severely damaged by an explosion of a powder magazine in 1656, foreshadowing the even more grievous damage to the Parthenon from a similar cause in 1687. A Frankish tower, erected on the south wing, was pulled down in 1874. Restoration Today the Propylaea has been partly restored, since 1984 under the direction of Tasos Tanoulas, and serves as the main entrance to the Acropolis for the many thousands of tourists who visit the area every year. In the period before the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, the Propylaea was shrouded in scaffolding as restoration work was undertaken. At the end of 2009 all scaffolding was removed, and the building is now open fully to view again. The famous ceilings have even been partly restored. The restoration of the central building of the Propylaea was awarded a European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award in 2013.

The hospital focuses on behavioral health, cardiology, emergency medicine, orthopedics, radiology and general surgery. Lower Bucks has a Level IV Trauma Center and is affiliated with the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine.  History  Lower Bucks Hospital was founded in 1954 as a community hospital. The hospital was funded by a local grassroots movement. In 2012, Prime Healthcare Services, an American private healthcare company, purchased the hospital and currently manages it. In 2010, Lower Bucks was on the brink of closure after suffering \\"operating losses of nearly $20 million over the previous five years\\". Senator Tommy Tomlinson saved the hospital with a Bill which legalized table games at casinos in Bucks County. The tax revenue generated allowed the hospital to avoid closure. In November 2019, Tomlinson received the Dee Brown Lifetime Achievement Award for his assistance. In 2016, Lower Bucks brought in a new team of emergency room doctors led by Dr. David Jaslow in an attempt to designate the emergency department as a Level IV Trauma Center. Jaslow served \\"eight years as deputy chief for clinical affairs and EMS medical director for the Bucks County Rescue Squad\\". His goal was \\"to rebuild [the] emergency department and to fix some systems\\". Linda Grass, CEO of Lower Bucks Hospital at the time said \\"this is our number-one initiative, our first step toward a clinical transformation of the hospital. We want to change community perception and have a higher-caliber of medical staff in the emergency department\\". The emergency department was previously staffed by \\"an outside firm that provided ER doctors on a contract basis\\". Statistics gathered in the emergency departments of Lower Bucks Hospital, Doylestown Hospital, St. Mary Medical Center and Jefferson Bucks Hospital were used and published by the National Sexual Violence Resource Center (NSVRC) to study the prevalence of violence in local communities. According to the study \\"one in five women and one in 71 men will experience rape at some point in their lives\\". On June 28, 2019, Michael Motte became the new CEO of Lower Bucks Hospital. Motte hopes to bring new services to the hospital including a \\"limb preservation program with a mobile unit\\" and a new program \\"designed to help people withdraw from opioids or alcohol\\".

Over his career, he served as the general manager of the Denver Nuggets, Los Angeles Clippers and Charlotte Hornets. He was also the commissioner of the Continental Basketball Association. He was the first GM in Hornets history and is credited as the inventor of the NBA Slam Dunk Contest. Early life and career Carl Scheer was born on December 14, 1936 in Springfield, Massachusetts to Robert and Minette Scheer. He was educated in Springfield and was an all-state basketball player. He graduated from Middlebury College, where he played basketball, and University of Miami School of Law before settling in Greensboro, North Carolina. Basketball career After law school, he became an agent and was hired as an assistant to then-NBA Commissioner, J. Walter Kennedy. In 1970, he jumped to the ABA to become GM of the Buffalo Braves, leaving a few months later for the Carolina Cougars. In 1974, both Scheer and Larry Brown moved to the Denver Rockets (later the Nuggets) as the Cougars owner planned to fold the franchise. with Brown as the head coach, Scheer built a team with Bobby Jones, David Thompson and Dan Issel that made it to the 1975‚Äì76 ABA Finals. It was in Denver that Scheer introduced the Slam Dunk Contest for the 1976 ABA All-Star Game, that featured David Thompson, Julius Erving and Artis Gilmore. Scheer made the contest a longstanding part of the NBA when he revived the idea for the 1984 NBA All- Star Game in Denver. In 1976, Scheer and Brown led the Nuggets through the merger with the NBA with the team entering the new merged league. Denver won two straight Midwest Division titles upon entering the NBA, and advanced to the 1978 Western Conference Final. Eventually, Scheer and Brown clashed, and Brown resigned midway through the 1978-79 season. Denver shuffled the front office and Scheer left the Nuggets in 1984. He moved to the Los Angeles Clippers in July 1984. His stay in Los Angeles was short after battling with team ownership and he ended up taking the job of commissioner of the Continental Basketball Association in 1986. One year later, Scheer was tapped to be the general manager of the New Jersey Nets. However only a few months later, the expansion Charlotte Hornets hired him as the new general manager once his commitments to the CBA ended. Charlotte owner George Shinn wanted Scheer to work under a handshake agreement while Scheer, an attorney, sought a multi-year contract. The dispute led to Scheer‚Äôs resignation in 1990. He left Charlotte to take over as president of the Nuggets. Scheer‚Äôs second stay in Denver was short, as he left only 14 months later amid other departures in the front office. In his later career, Scheer worked as an executive with two minor-league hockey teams, the Charlotte Checkers and the Greenville Grrrowl. Personal life Scheer was married to Marsha (Krieger) Scheer from 1959 until his death. He had two children, Bob and Lauren. Scheer died on December 13, 2019, at the age of 82, from complications of dementia, in Charlotte, North Carolina.

It is closely related to Hokkien, with which it shares some cognates and phonology, though the two are largely mutually unintelligible. Chaoshan preserves many similarities to Old Chinese in its pronunciation and vocabulary that have been lost in most other Sinitic languages. As such, Chaoshan is considered to be one of the more conservative Chinese languages.Nominalization in Asian Languages: Diachronic and typological perspectives, p. 11, Yap, FoongHa; Grunow-H√•rsta, Karen; Wrona, Janick (ed.) John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2011 Classification Chaoshan is a Southern Min language. As with other Sinitic languages, it is not mutually intelligible with Mandarin, Cantonese or Shanghainese. It has only limited intelligibility with Hokkien, with Chaoshan-speakers generally not recognizing Hokkien as a kindred language within the Chinese family. Even within the Chaoshan dialects, there is substantial variation in phonology between different regions and between different Chaoshan communities overseas. Dialectologically, the Chaoshan dialects may be divided into three groups as defined by physically proximate areas: * Chaozhou (), including Chaozhou, Shantou, Jieyang, Nan'ao and Raoping cities and counties Teochew dialect (Chaozhou) () Shantou dialect (Swatow) () Jieyang dialect () * Chaopu (), including Puning and Huilai counties and Chaoyang district of Shantou County Chaoyang dialect () Puning dialect () Huilai dialect () * Hailufeng (), including Shanwei, Lufeng and Haifeng counties Hailufeng dialect () History and geography Ketapang, West Kalimantan, Indonesia on the island of Borneo The Chaoshan region, which includes the twin cities of Chaozhou and Shantou, is where the standard variant of Chaoshan is spoken. Parts of the Hakka-speaking regions of Jiexi County, Dabu County and Fengshun, also contain pocket communities of Chaoshan speakers. As Chaoshan was one of the major sources of Chinese emigration to Southeast Asia during the 18th to 20th centuries, a considerable Overseas Chinese community in that region is Chaoshan-speaking. In particular, the Chaoshan people settled in significant numbers in Cambodia, Thailand and Laos, where they form the largest Chinese sub-language group. Additionally, there are many Chaoshan-speakers among Chinese communities in Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia (especially in the states of Johor and Selangor) and Indonesia (especially in West Kalimantan on Borneo). Waves of migration from Chaoshan to Hong Kong, especially after the communist victory of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, has also resulted in the formation of a community there, although most descendants now primarily speak Cantonese and English. Chaoshan speakers are also found among overseas Chinese communities in Japan and the Western world (notably in the United States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, France and Italy), a result of both direct emigration from Chaoshan to these nations and secondary emigration from Southeast Asia. In Singapore, Chaoshan remains the ancestral language of many Chinese Singaporeans, with Chinese of Teochew descent making up second largest Chinese group in Singapore, after the Hoklo. Despite this many Teochew, particularly the younger generations are shifting towards English and Mandarin as their main spoken language. This is due to the Singapore government's stringent bilingual policy that promotes English as the official language of education, government and commerce and promotes Mandarin at the expense of other Chinese languages. Some Teochew assimilated with the larger Hokkien community and speak Hokkien rather than Chaoshan due to Hokkien's prominent role as a lingua franca previously among the Singaporean Chinese community. Relationship with Hokkien Chaoshan and Hokkien are both Southern Min languages. Hokkien, which is spoken in southern Fujian, and Chaoshan share many phonetic similarities, due to historical influence, but have low lexical similarity. Although Chaoshan and Hokkien share some cognates, there are pronounced differences in most vowels with some consonant and tone shifts. Many of the vocabulary is distinct. For example while Hokkien use the word beh () to mean 'want', in Chaoshan the word ai (), which means 'love', is also used to mean 'want'. Hokkien uses the word ia () for 'very', while Teochews use the word kue (), which also means 'to cross or to pass' in their language. Other than the -p final found in both languages, Hokkien retains the different finals of -n, -ng, -t and -k while Chaoshan only has -ng and -k finals as a result of final-merging. Chaoshan (Teochew dialect) has only 51% intelligibility with the Tong'an Xiamen dialect of Hokkien (Cheng 1997), approximately the same as the percentage of intelligibility as between Russian and Ukrainian languages, while it has even lower mutual intelligibility language with other dialects of the Hokkien language. Most Teochews do not speak Hokkien and the majority of Hokkiens and Teochews both see themselves as a distinct groups. There are a minority of Teochews who speak Hokkien as their mother tongue, most of whom have close contact or relatives in the neighbouring three originally-Teochew counties of what is now South Fujian, which were seceded to Fujian during the early Tang dynasty and subsequently assimilated into the Hokkien population. These Hokkien-speaking Teochews are more likely to treat Chaoshan simply as accented dialect of Hokkien. These people usually have a strong sense of Hokkien identity.

The funeral ceremony of Soleimani in Tehran was described as \\"the largest in Iran since the funeral of Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini\\", founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, in 1989. On 7 January 2020, a stampede took place at the burial procession in Kerman, killing at least 56 mourners and injuring over 200. Consequently, Soleimani's burial was delayed due to the massive crowds. His body was buried in his hometown of Kerman on Wednesday, 8 January, just hours after Iran attacked two US bases in Iraq. Iraq On 5 January, a funeral procession for Qasem Soleimani was held in Baghdad with thousands of mourners in attendance, waving militia and Iraqi flags and chanting \\"death to America, death to Israel\\". The procession started at the Al-Kadhimiya Mosque in Baghdad. Iraq's prime minister, Adil Abdul-Mahdi, and leaders of Iran-backed militias attended the funeral procession. Soleimani's remains were taken to the holy Shia cities of Karbala and Najaf.

During Ayatollah Khomeini's 1989 funeral procession, eight people were killed in a stampede, also caused in part due to difficulty in containing the massive crowd. Soleimani had asked prior to his death to be buried next to his wartime comrade Mohammad-Hossein Yousefollahi. He asked for a simple gravestone \\"similar to [his] shahid comrades\\" and with the inscription \\" Soldier Qassem Soleimani\\" (), without any honorific title.

Life Lavigne was born in Besan√ßon in 1816, and received his early musical education from his father, a musician in an infantry regiment. In 1830 he was admitted a pupil of the Conservatoire de Paris, where he studied the oboe under Gustave Vogt. He was obliged to leave in May 1835, when his father's regiment was ordered from Paris. He rejoined the school in October 1836, and obtained the first prize in 1837. Lavigne was for several years principal oboe at the Th√©√¢tre-Italien at Paris. In 1841 he came to England, and appeared as oboe soloist at the Promenade Concerts at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Later he was for many years a member of the Hall√© Orchestra in Manchester. He addressed himself with great earnestness to applying to the oboe the system of keys which Boehm had contrived for the flute, and devoted several years to perfecting the instrument. The music critic William Henry Husk wrote: \\"This admirable player has great execution and feeling; but what he is most remarkable for is his power and length of breath, which by some secret known to himself enables him to give the longest phrases without breaking them.\\" Lavigne was among the musicians in an orchestra which in 1853 travelled to America with the conductor Louis-Antoine Jullien.

Life Born at Opotiki in 1887, he was the eighth and youngest child of Alfred John Sisam, a police officer and farmer, and his wife Maria Knights. He was educated at Auckland Grammar School, and entered University College, Auckland, in 1906 with a scholarship, where he graduated MA in 1910. With a Rhodes scholarship, Sisam matriculated at Merton College, Oxford, in 1910. He completed a B.Litt. there under Arthur Napier in 1915, producing an edition of the Salisbury Psalter. He married that year. In this period he taught students including J. R. R. Tolkien.John Garth, Tolkien and the Great War: The Threshold of Middle-Earth (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2003), p. 34. Poor health ruled out military service, and he went to work part-time on the Oxford English Dictionary. In 1916 he published on the Beowulf manuscript. In 1917 the Sisams moved to London, where Kenneth worked as a civil servant. In 1922 he joined Oxford University Press (OUP). With his promotion to assistant secretary, they built a family house at Boars Hill. From 1922 to 1942 Sisam worked at OUP under Robert William Chapman while developing his scholarly work on Anglo-Saxon, but failing in 1925 to become Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon when Tolkien was chosen. OUP successes under his stewardship include introducing thirty new titles to the Oxford World's Classics series; the creation of the Oxford Companion to English and the Oxford Latin Dictionary, and the recruitment of W. B. Yeats as editor of The Oxford Book of Modern Verse.John M. Bowers, Tolkien's Lost Chaucer (Oxford: Oxford UP, 2019), p. 56. Sisam was elected to the British Academy in 1941. Appointed OUP secretary in succession to Chapman in 1942, he became a Fellow of Merton College. In 1948 he retired to the Scilly Isles but continued to produce scholarship, including The Structure of Beowulf (1965). He died in a nursing home at Lelant in Cornwall on 26 August 1971. Family In 1915 Sisam married Naomi Irene Gibbons (1886‚Äì1958), daughter of Robert Pearce Gibbons, from Auckland. They had a son and a daughter, Celia (born 1926), who became a scholar of Anglo-Saxon.

Originally named Deville in 1888 by mountaineer Rev. William S. Green, Mount Selwyn was renamed to honor Alfred Richard Cecil Selwyn (1824-1902), director of the Geological Survey of Canada, and President of the Royal Society of Canada.Canadian Mountain Place Names, Glen W. Boles, Rocky Mountain Books, 2006, pg 224 The mountain's name was officially adopted September 8, 1932, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1890 by Harold E. Forster, Harold Ward Topham, Harry Sinclair, and Samuel Yves. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Selwyn is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. This climate supports an intensely glaciated area around the mountain including the Fox Glacier on the north aspect, The Bishops Glacier on the south, the Deville N√©v√© to southeast, and the Deville Glacier to the east.

Early life Ellen Arnold was born on 5 July 1858 in Aston, Warwickshire, England to Alfred Arnold and Ellen Jane Seager. Her father was a jeweller in Birmingham. They migrated to Adelaide in 1879, where they became members of Flinders Street Baptist Church. She became a teacher, after being in the first intake of the Adelaide Teachers' College. Career Arnold was influenced by her pastor, Silas Mead, who had founded the Australian Baptist Missionary Society in 1864. After some medical training, she and Marie Glibert went to Furreedpore (then part of British India) in October 1882, the first missionaries sent by the newly formed Society, undertaking \\"zenana work\\". Arnold returned to Australia in 1884 suffering illness and undertook a tour of the colonies and New Zealand which became known as the \\"crusade of Ellen Arnold.\\" This led to the establishment of the Queensland and New Zealand Baptist Missionary Societies. Four other young women decided to join her (becoming known as the \\"five barley loaves\\") in East Bengal, which then became the primary mission field for Australian Baptists. Arnold purchased land in Comilla and began building a mission house in 1889, before moving there in 1890. She spent her life preaching, establishing schools and dispensing medicine. She became fluent in Bengali and helped establish the East Bengal Baptist Union. She later moved to Pubna where there were tensions with other missionaries, particularly as the men, who had arrived later, controlled the finances and movements of the women. In 1912 she was instructed by the Australian society to \\"stop interfering in the Pubna men's department or come home.\\" From 1913, she lived in a thatched, mud-floored village hut among the local people rather than in the typical British Raj style properties of her colleagues. Arnold retired to Australia in 1930, with the East Bengal Baptist Union taking over her work, but returned to India as a voluntary worker and died in Ataikola on 9 July 1931 after refusing surgery for a malignant growth. Honours In 1919 Arnold was awarded the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal for public service in India, but declined to accept it. The Ellen Arnold Memorial Dispensary at Ataikola was established in her name and the Bangladesh Baptist Union observes the day of her death as \\"Ellen Arnold Day.\\" References Category:1858 births Category:1931 deaths Category:People from Warwickshire (before 1974) Category:People from Adelaide Category:People from Faridpur District Category:19th-century Baptists Category:Australian Baptist missionaries Category:Baptist missionaries in Bangladesh Category:Recipients of the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal Category:19th- century Australian women Category:20th-century Australian women ","title":"Ellen Arnold"},{"id":"62612130","text":"Nagma ( ‚Äì 28 September 2015) was a Bangladeshi film actress.

The tree had long been hollow and is reputed to have been used by the legendary outlaw Robin Hood and others as a larder for poached meat. It was badly burnt by fire in the late 19th century and again in 1913. The tree fell in a gale in 1961 and no trace of it remains.  Location  The oak tree was located in Birklands, part of Sherwood Forest that was first mentioned in 1251 and in continual ownership by the crown for 600 years. It was situated approximately west of the village of Ollerton and west of the Major Oak. The site is currently in the ownership of the Forestry Commission and the Sherwood Forest Visitor Centre, run by Nottinghamshire County Council, is nearby.  In legend  The tree's name derives from an association with the legendary figure of Robin Hood. It is reputed that Robin Hood used the hollow trunk of the tree as a temporary store for venison poached from the royal forest. The use of such trees for storing game was common in the times before refrigeration and regardless of the veracity of the Robin Hood legend it is likely that at some point the tree was used for this purpose by poachers. It is said that in earlier times hooks used for the hanging of meat could still be seen affixed to the inside of the tree; these had vanished by 1913. Because of this legend the tree has also been known as the Butcher's Oak, the Slaughter Tree and the Shambles Oak, the latter because it was the traditional name for an area of town where butchers and abattoirs were located.  History Robin Hood's Larder shown on an 1880 postcard An 1874 guidebook to the region mentions the tree and states that it was used formerly by a thief named Hooton to hang the carcasses of stolen sheep. At this point, the hollow trunk was big enough to accommodate 12 people. The tree was later reinforced with iron bars and cables. Towards the end of the 19th century the tree was badly burned in a fire originating from a group of schoolgirls boiling a kettle within the hollow. It was again damaged by a fire set by picnickers in 1913. In the same year, it was mentioned in a book of Robert Murray Gilchrist who described the tree as \\"an old, old man who will be brave to the end\\". Gilchrist noted the foliage was scanty but the tree retained live upper branches until after 1938. In 1938, the trunk measured in circumference and the hollow accounted for approximately one quarter of this. Robin Hood's Larder fell by a gale in 1961 and no trace of it remains today.

The national office is in Melbourne. History Australian Baptists had been sending money to the Baptist Missionary Society in London as their expression of interest in mission. The South Australian Baptist Missionary Society was founded at Flinders Street Baptist Church on 10 November 1864 under Rev Silas Mead, and the first missionaries, Ellen Arnold and Marie Gilbert, were sent to East Bengal in 1882. Arnold returned to Australia in 1884 suffering illness and undertook a tour of the colonies and New Zealand which became known as the \\"crusade of Ellen Arnold.\\" This led to the establishment of the Queensland and New Zealand Baptist Missionary Societies. Four other young women decided to join her (becoming known as the \\"five barley loaves\\") in East Bengal, which then became the primary mission field for Australian Baptists. Between 1882 and 1913, the colonial societies sent fifty-four women and sixteen men to Bengal, including Mead's son Dr Cecil Mead and his wife Alice. The women visited Indian women in their zenanas. The work of the mission was almost solely focused in India for 80 years. Wilton Hack, a South Australian Baptist pastor, had raised private funds to go to Japan in 1874, not wanting to take money prioritised to the work in Faridpur. The various state missionary societies federated in 1913 as the Australian Baptist Mission. It was renamed the Australian Baptist Missionary Society in 1959 and then Global Interaction in 2002. Work in Papua New Guinea began in 1949, at the urging of returned World War II chaplains, with focus on Bible translation as well as health and education. By 1995 the Baptist Union of Papua New Guinea had 35,000 members. Workers were later sent to Papua and Timor, and then to Zambia and Zimbabwe, later moving to Malawi and Mozambique. More recent locations include Thailand in 1972, Cambodia, and Kazakhstan. In many locations, the goal has been to develop the indigenous church and work towards handover. Baptist missionary services to Aboriginal communities in Central Australia began in 1947 under the Australian Baptist Federal Home Mission Board. This became part of ABMS in the 1970s. As of 2013, Global Interaction had 123 missionaries working in 17 different regions. The mission has produced a magazine called Vision since 1950. They have also published papers and biographies by a number of their missionaries.

It is a single territorial infantry battalion of the British Armed Forces that was formed in 2020. History =2019= On 12 October 2019, the government announced the formation of the Cayman Islands Regiment, a new British Armed Forces unit. The Cayman Islands Regiment was planned to become operational in 2020, with an initial 35‚Äì50 personnel of mostly reservists that are locally recruited and likely initially trained as engineers. The expected growth of the Regiment is expected to see an increase of personnel to several hundred. One of the main goals of the Regiment would be humanitarian relief, responding to natural disasters on the islands as well as regionally to events such as hurricanes. However, the Regiment is to be assisted by the UK Ministry of Defence and Foreign and Commonwealth Office and is likely to be in the form of logistical advice and support and further along include operational training and equipment. It was said to be in ways similar to the Royal Bermuda Regiment, the Royal Gibraltar Regiment, the Falkland Islands Defence Force and Royal Montserrat Defence Force and is to be linked with the British Army Corps of Royal Engineers. A team of experts from the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will deploy to the Cayman Islands before end of year for operational needs assessment, to begin the advisory and support roles and to determine a suitable location to base the Regiment. On 15 October 2019, Government of Bermuda issued a statement that the Royal Bermuda Regiment is ready to assist the Cayman Islands Regiment and to share their experiences, as the Cayman Islands Regiment builds. In mid-November 2019, the team from the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence from 131 Commando Squadron Royal Engineers, 40 Commando Royal Marines, and Royal Navy arrived in Grand Cayman to begin work on setting up the Cayman Islands Regiment. In mid-December 2019, recruitment for junior and commanding officers began, with the commanding officers expected to begin work in January 2020 and the junior officers to begin work in February 2020. In December 2019, Turks and Caicos Islands Governor Nigel Dakin had announced that they will also follow the Cayman Islands in the formation of the Turks and Caicos Regiment. The Turks and Caicos Regiment will operate similarly to the Cayman Islands Regiment and the Royal Bermuda Regiment and the roles of the Regiment will also be the same as their British Overseas Territories counterparts. The Turks and Caicos Regiment also will be assisted by the UK Ministry of Defence and Foreign and Commonwealth Office. =2020= In late January 2020, the first set of senior officers and junior officers were chosen. The Commanding Officer was announced to be Lieutenant Colonel Simon Watson, who was formerly an Officer for the Royal Dragoon Guards. The Second in Command is Lieutenant Colonel Simon Spiers.

The first six Jr. Officers were chosen, these six will be sent for training in mid-February 2020 to Bermuda with the Royal Bermuda Regiment, and thereafter onwards to the United Kingdom for additional officer training at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. An additional 50-60 personnel will be recruited and will also be sent for training in Bermuda with the Royal Bermuda Regiment in early Summer 2020. The Regimental Sergeant Major is Warrant Officer 1 David Shelton, who has had 13 years of Non-Commissioned Officer experience in the British Army with Operational Tours of Duty, Training, and Recruitment. In early June 2020, five of the junior officer cadets began their officer training at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and the recruitment of the 50 additional personnel began. Commanding officers As of January 2020, the commanding officer is Lieutenant Colonel Simon Watson. Recruitment and training The first set of junior officer recruits were sent to Bermuda to train at Warwick Camp in Bermuda to train alongside recruits of the Bermuda Regiment for their basic military training. This is a two-week course. On the completion of this course the officer recruits will take on an intense condensed 8 week Officer course at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Uniforms The uniforms, weapons, and equipment for the Cayman Islands Regiment will be provided by the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence. During the basic training, the recruits are given the same kits as those of the Bermuda Regiment recruits. This is mainly the British Army's No. 8 Combat Dress Multi-Terrain Pattern Personal Clothing System ‚Äì Combat Uniform (PCS-CU). The PCS-CU mostly consists of a windproof smock, a lightweight jacket, and trousers with a range of ancillaries such as thermals and waterproofs.

Biography  Helena Gualinga was born on February 27, 2002, in the Indigenous Kichwa Sarayaku community located in Pastaza, Ecuador. Her mother, Noem√≠ Gualinga is an Indigenous Ecuadorian former president of the Kichwa Women's Association. Her older sister is the activist Nina Gualinga. Her aunt Patricia Gualinga and her grandmother Cristina Gualinga are defenders of Indigenous women's human rights in the Amazon and environmental causes. Her father is Anders Sir√©n, a Finnish professor of geography and geology at the University of Turku. Gualinga was born in Sarayaku territory in Pastaza, Ecuador. She spent most of her teenage years living in Pargas and later in Turku, Finland where her father comes from. She attends secondary school at the Cathedral School of √Öbo. From a young age Gualinga has witnessed the persecution of her family for standing against the interests of big oil companies and their environmental impact on Indigenous land. Several leaders members of her community have lost their life in violent conflicts against the government and corporations. She has stated for Yle that she sees her involuntary upbringing in such an agitated environment as an opportunity. = Activism = Gualinga has become a spokesperson for the Sarayaku Indigenous community. Her activism includes exposing the conflict between her community and oil companies by carrying an empowering message among the youth in local schools in Ecuador. She also actively exposes this message to the international community hoping to reach policy-makers. In her message, she exposes how Indigenous communities in the Amazon have experienced climate change. She includes the higher prevalence of fires, flood-related diseases and devastation, desertification, and the faster melting of mountain peak glaciers experienced during the life time of the elder members of her community as first-hand evidence of climate change. Gualinga claims that they have become aware of climate change regardless of their lack of scientific structure. Gualinga held a sign that read \\"sangre ind√≠gena, ni una sola gota m√°s\\" (Indigenous blood, not one more drop) outside of the UN headquarters in New York City at a demonstration with hundreds other of young environmental activists during the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit. Helena Gualinga participated in the COP25 in Madrid, Spain. She spoke about her concern on the Ecuadorian government authorizing oil extraction in indigenous land. She said: \\"Our country's government is still granting our territories to the corporations responsible of climate change. This is criminal.\\" She criticized the Ecuadorian government for claiming interest in protecting the Amazon during the conference instead of attending indigenous Amazon women's demands brought to the government during the 2019 Ecuadorian protests. She also expressed her disappointment towards world leaders' lack of interest to discuss topics brought by indigenous peoples to the conference. She started the movement \\"Polluters Out\\" along with other 150 environmental activists, on January 24, 2020. The movement's petition is to \\"Demand that Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Refuse Funding From Fossil Fuel Corporations For COP26!\\"  References  Category:2002 births Category:Living people Category:Ecuadorian activists Category:Ecuadorian people of Finnish descent Category:Expatriates in Finland Category:Women activists Category:Ecuadorian environmentalists ","title":"Helena Gualinga"},{"id":"62612550","text":"George Heyes was an English professional goalkeeper who spent a large part of his career at Leicester City.

It is very similar to tortang talong in that the eggplant is first grilled directly on an open flame, then peeled and mashed. It is then added to ginisa (sauteed shallots, garlic, and tomatoes) and scrambled eggs. It is garnished with spring onions. It has a creamy texture and is usually eaten as a side dish to grilled fish and meat dishes, but it can also be eaten with white rice. It is believed that the name of poqui poqui may have originated from the Hawaiin dish poke due to the influx of Ilocano sugarcane workers to Hawaii during the American colonization of the Philippines, although they are very different dishes.

Peck (October 25, 1882 ‚Äì January 11, 1964) was an American author and poet from Vermont. She published several historical novels when she was in her twenties and thirties, and her poems were published in magazines, newspapers, and literary journals throughout her life. Early life Theodora Agnes Peck was born in Burlington, Vermont on October 25, 1882. An only child, her father was Theodore S. Peck, a recipient of the Medal of Honor during the American Civil War, and her mother was Agnes Louise Lesslie (1843‚Äì1917) of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Peck attended the public schools of Burlington and graduated from Burlington High School in 1900. She then attended a special non-degree program at the University of Vermont, which she completed in 1904. Writing career In 1900, Peck authored the poem \\"A Dream of the Flag\\", which she read at several public events. Her poem was subsequently published in Leslie‚Äôs Popular Monthly. In 1905, Peck published her first novel, Hester of the Grants: A Romance of Old Bennington. This endeavor was widely reported on in newspapers nationwide, owing largely to her sex and youth. Residing temporarily in Scotland provided the inspiration for Peck‚Äôs next novel, 1908's The Sword of Dundee: A Tale of Bonnie Prince Charlie. The book that followed was another historical work set in Revolutionary War-era Vermont, 1914's White Dawn: A Legend of Ticonderoga. Peck continued to write and publish poetry throughout her life. Her work appeared in numerous newspapers, magazines, and literary journals and she was frequently asked to provide readings of her work at veterans‚Äô reunions, memorial dedications, and other public events. Affiliations and memberships During her life, Peck maintained membership in several professional and legacy societies, including the Burlington Literary Society, Daughters of the American Revolution, Society of Colonial Dames, and United Daughters of 1812. She was a member of the Athena Club (a women‚Äôs service organization) and was active with the Third Order of Saint Francis. Peck was an honorary member of the Society of the Army of the Potomac, the International Mark Twain Society and the Institute Litteraire et Artistique de France. At age 18, she became the first female honorary member of the Medal of Honor Legion of the United States (now referred to as the Legion of Valor) after being bestowed medal number one of the Second Class. Philanthropy Peck was also a philanthropist and benefactor, and her causes included Burlington's Young Men‚Äôs Christian Association (YMCA) and Saint Michael's College in Colchester. At her death, her family's home was sold and the proceeds were used to establish the Theodora Agnes Peck Scholarship Endowment at the University of Vermont. Death and burial Peck died in Burlington on January 11, 1964. A 1920 convert to Catholicism, her funeral took place at Burlington‚Äôs Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. She was buried at Lakeview Cemetery in Burlington. Peck never married, and had no children. In July 1963, obituaries for Teresa (or Theresa) C. Egan, who died at age 80, indicated that she had been Theodora Peck's live-in companion for more than 40 years.

Its purpose is to document all the legal citizens of India so that the illegal immigrants can be identified and deported.Assam final NRC list released: 19,06,657 people excluded, 3.11 crore make it to citizenship list, India Today, 31 August 2019.Ravi Agrawal, Kathryn Salam, India Is Betraying Its Founding Fathers, Foreign Policy, 17 December 2019. It has been implemented for the state of Assam starting in 2013‚Äì2014. The Government of India plans to implement it for the rest of the country in 2021.  Background  Assam, being a border state with unique problems of illegal immigration, had a register of citizens created for it in 1951 based on the 1951 census data. However, it was not maintained afterwards. The Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act, 1983 was then passed by the Parliament, creating a separate tribunal process for identifying illegal migrants in Assam. The Supreme Court of India struck it down as unconstitutional in 2005, after which the Government of India agreed to update the Assam NRC. Following unsatisfactory progress on the process of updating the Assam NRC for over a decade, the Supreme Court started directing and monitoring the process in 2013. The final updated NRC for Assam, published on 31 August 2019, contained 31 million (3.1 crore) names out of its population of 33 million (3.3 crore), leaving out 1.9 million (19 lakh) applicants, rendering them potentially stateless. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has championed the NRC exercise, did not find the results meeting its expectations. It believes that several legitimate citizens were excluded while many illegal migrants were included. The BJP has promised to implement the NRC for all of India in its election manifesto for the 2019 Indian general election. On 19 November 2019, Home minister Amit Shah declared in the Rajya Sabha of the Indian parliament that the NRC would be implemented throughout the country. According to the Citizenship Rules, 2003, the central government can issue an order to prepare the National Population Register (NPR) and create the NRC based on the data gathered in it. The 2003 amendment further states that the local officials would then decide if the person's name will be added to the NRC or not, thereby deciding his citizenship status. No new rules or laws are needed to conduct this exercise in the whole of India. Legal and regulatory provisions The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 (numbered \\"Act 6 of 2004\\") added the following clause to the Citizenship Act, 1955: The Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, formulated under the Act specify: As explained by the Ministry of Home Affairs in December 2018, \\"The Citizenship Act of 1955 provides for compulsory registration of every citizen of India and issuance of National Identity Card to him. The Citizenship Rules of 2003, framed under the Citizenship Act of 1955, prescribe the manner of preparation of the National Register of Citizens. There is a special provision under the Rules to prepare the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam which is application-based and distinct from the rest of India where the process is enumeration-based.\\" National Population Register No NPR CAA NRC graffiti at Shaheen Bagh protests in New Delhi, 8 January 2020 The National Population Register (NPR) is a list of all the people residing in India and includes both the citizens and the non-citizens. This definition was stated by the then Minister of State for Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, as a response in the Rajya Sabha, that was released on 26 November 2014 by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. It stated that \\"the NPR is the first step towards creation of National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC) by verifying the citizenship status of every usual residents.\\" Residents of a locality living there for at least six months with plans to continue their residence for another six months or more are included into the list of NPR. It is prepared as per the provisions of the Citizenship Act, 1955, and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003 (passed by the BJP government under Vajpayee). The listing is done at the local (village/sub-town), sub-district, district, state and national level. Every \\"usual resident of India\\" is required to register in the NPR. According to the Citizenship Rules, 2003, the centre can issue an order to prepare the NPR and create the NRC based on the data gathered in the NPR. As per the 2003 Citizenship rules, the local officials would then decide if the person's name will be added to the NRC or not, thereby deciding his citizenship status. No new rules or laws are needed to conduct this exercise in the whole of India. On 18 June 2014, then Home Minister Rajnath Singh had given instructions \\"to take NPR project to its logical conclusion which is creation of National Register of Indian Citizens\\". Since 2014, the government has stated in the Parliament several times that the National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC) or NRC is based on the data collected under the NPR, after the verification of the citizenship status of every individual. In 2010, the NPR was created for the first time with the names of 119 crore residents of India. This data further was updated in 2015 by linking with biometric information from Aadhaar database. The NPR planned for 2020 will also include more details such as the place of birth of the parents, last place of residence and the serial number for official documents. Critics believe the Indian government will use the list to mark people as doubtful citizens after which they would be asked to prove their citizenship. National Social Registry The National Social Registry will either be a single, searchable Aadhaar-seeded database, or ‚Äúa cluster of multiple databases‚Äù that use Aadhaar numbers to integrate religion, caste, income, property, education, Civil status, or marital status, employment, disability and family-tree data of each single citizen. it'll automatically update itself in real-time. Implementation On 24 December 2019, the Union Cabinet approved for updating the NPR, marking one of the first steps in implementing the NRC. The NPR is scheduled to take place in April 2020 throughout India (except Assam). Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 22 December 2019 stated that \\"there has been no discussion on NRC anywhere... we only had to implement it in Assam to follow Supreme Court directives.\\" The CPI(M) leader Prakash Karat alleged it to be\\"disinformation\\" by the government. Karat clarified that the NPR was the first step of the NRC process. On 31 July 2019, the Registrar General of Citizen Registration had issued the notification to prepare and update the NPR. The timeline for this was announced to be between 1 April 2020 and 30 September 2020. As per the NPR exercise, an enumeration will be carried out throughout the country (except Assam) by visiting every house for \\"collection of information relating to all persons who are usually residing within the jurisdiction of the Local Registrar\\". According to the procedure announced through the \\"Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules 2003\\", the list of NPR will undergo due verification and it will form the basis of the local register of Indian citizens. Detention Centres According to the Section 3(2)(c) of The Foreigners Act, 1946, the central government can deport people of foreign countries who are staying illegally in India. In anticipation of the possible requirement to house a large number of illegal foreigners, who may be declared as such by the final NRC of India and the Foreigners' Tribunals, the government is in the process of building several detention camps throughout India. One of the first detention centres had come up in Assam during the tenure of the Congress government in 2008. In 2014, the Centre had told all the states to set up at least one detention centre for illegal immigrants so as not to mix them up with jail inmates. Slogans and graffiti protesting against CAA, NRC and detention camps in New Delhi on 8 January 2020. Visible are \\"Detention Camp = Jail = Gas Chamber\\", \\"Detention camp = Hell\\" and \\"Reject NRC\\" among others. Comparisons with Nazi Germany are visible. In 2018, activists filed a petition in the Supreme Court of India and brought to its notice the condition of the families separated from each other and locked separately in the six existing detention centres of Assam. On 9 January 2019, the Union government released a '2019 Model Detention Manual', which stated that every city or district, having a major immigration check post, must have a detention centre. The guidelines suggest detention centres with 10 feet high boundary walls covered with barbed wires. It also clarified the difference between a prison and a detention centre. * Delhi Detention Centre is spread over three locations in Delhi to hold foreigners waiting for deportation. One of the centres at Lampur is being operated under the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO). The Special Branch of Delhi Police supervises the ward holding the Pakistanis, while people of other nationalities are under the watch of the FRRO. FRRO and Delhi police both work under the Central Home Ministry. * Goa Detention Centre at Mapusa was opened for foreigners in May 2019. * Karnataka Detention Centre is under construction at Sondekoppa in Nelamangala, located 40 kms from Bangalore. It is planned to be operational from 1 January 2020.

AS of 2019, the foreigners are kept in a separate enclosure at Central Jail in Amritsar. * Rajasthan Detention Centre is located in the campus of the Central Jail in Alwar. In December 2019, it was reported that the detention centres planned in West Bengal and Kerala had been put on hold. =Assam Detention Centre= The first detention centre in Assam came up in 2008, when the Congress was in power in the state, under orders of the court. In 2011, the Congress government built three more camps in the region. The Government of the state of Assam is constructing ten more detention camps besides six already in place. The first such new exclusive detention camp is under construction in the district of Goalpara in lower Assam at the cost of around and a capacity to hold 3000 people. The detention center covers approximately square feet (about the size of seven football grounds) and was planned to have fifteen storeys. It was planned to be ready by December 2019. CAA and NRC protests Protest against CAA and NRC CAA and NRC protests are a series of protests in India against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which was enacted into law on December 12, 2019, and against the nationwide implementation of the NRC. Protesters in all regions are concerned that the upcoming compilation of the National Register of Citizens might be used to deprive Muslims of Indian citizenship. As of 12 January 2020, activists have continued to protest the act on the streets, with a lot of individuals carrying placards criticizing the act as well as the government.

The attack is one of many that has been linked to the Glenanne gang. Attack The 'Bleary Darts Club' was frequented mainly by Catholics but was also visited by Protestants.McKittrick, David. Lost Lives: The Stories of the Men, Women and Children who Died as a Result of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Random House, 2001. p.537 On the night of 27 April 1975, there were about thirty men inside. At about 10:40pm, three masked loyalist gunmen kicked the door open and opened fire on the crowd with a Sterling submachine gun, a Webley Revolver and a shotgun. When the burst of gunfire stopped, a customer switched the lights off so the gunmen could not see. There was then another burst of gunfire, followed by several single shots. Another customer kicked the door shut, and the gunmen left. Three men were killed, all Catholic civilians: father-of eight John Feeney (45), father-of-six Joseph Toman (48), and father-of-four Brendan O'Hara (38). A fourth man, a Protestant, was seriously wounded. Perpetrators The attack was claimed by the \\"Protestant Action Force\\", a cover name used by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), an Ulster loyalist paramilitary group. It is believed the attackers were part of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade. Six days before the attack at Bleary, the group had claimed responsibility for killing three Catholic civilians‚Äîtwo brothers and their pregnant sister‚Äîin a booby-trap bomb attack at a house near Granville, County Tyrone. Loyalists Stuart Ashtown and Derek McFarland admitted to the attack in 1980Report of the Independent International Panel on Alleged Collusion on Sectarian Killings in Northern Ireland. Center for Civil and Human Rights, Notre Dame Law School, 2006. p. 47 along with a string of other offenses, including the shooting of Catholic civilians Marian Rafferty and Thomas Mitchell. The shooting is one of many in the area that has been linked to the Glenanne gang; a group of loyalists that included police officers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and soldiers from the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). The sub-machine gun was used in the Miami Showband massacre, which was carried out by members of the group three months later. Circumstantial evidence links Robin Jackson to the attack. Among other evidence, a witness saw him in a car near the club the Sunday before the attack, and saw the same car near the club again, about half an hour before the attack.

Ross, published by Random House. The book described the operations and activities of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) at the time. Christopher Wright of Columbia University wrote that the book argues \\"that to a significant extent major policies of the United States in the cold war are established and implemented with the help of government mechanisms and procedures that are invisible to the public and seem to lack the usual political and budgetary constraints on their activities and personnel.\\"Wright, p. 121. The New York Times described the book as \\"a journalistic, dramatic narrative that may move us toward a fundamental reappraisal of where secret operations fit into a democratic nation.\\" Wise stated that when the work was published, ordinary people generally had little knowledge of what the CIA did, and that the book \\"was the first serious study of the CIA‚Äôs activities\\", something that the CIA disliked. Wright added that \\"Subsequent admissions and appraisals [...] have further substantiated the reports [...] and reinforced the main thesis\\". Background Books written by former CIA employees have to be approved and censored by the agency itself; Wise and Ross were never CIA employees, so the agency had no power to censor the book. Ronald Steel of Commentary stated that \\"Random House was reportedly urged to suppress the book\\". The agency created a plan to buy as many books as possible from bookshops, but the agency did not go forward with this as Bennett Cerf, the president of Random House, informed the CIA that the company would order additional printings if the CIA bought the first printing. Content Much of the book focuses on CIA activities in Cuba and Southeast Asia. Reception The New York Times concluded that the book \\"forces attention on a painful and perilous dilemma we have been avoiding too long.\\" The publication stated that \\"annoying carelessness of detail causes one to hope that their substantive assertions are more accurate.\\" Wright concluded that the authors \\"have done a service to scholarship by assembling evidence of the depth of this policy confusion.\\"Wright, p. 123.

Early life Hornby‚Äôs father ran the Royal Shakespeare Company and later became chairman of Rank Xerox; his mother was a journalist. Hornby was born in Lemington Spa, but due to his father‚Äôs work, he attended a state school in the south of France before moving to Connecticut. At fourteen years of age, Hornby‚Äôs father sent him to board at Marlborough College in Wiltshire, England. Upon graduation, he studied history and politics at Edinburgh University. At 19 years of age, Hornby interned as a runner at the Cogent Elliot agency. Upon graduation, Hornby worked at the Ogilvy & Mather agency before moving to CDP in 1995, where he gained his first senior position. Career =The early 00s= After working at Ogilvy and CDP, Hornby became the managing director of the international advertising agency TBWA. Following a search co-ordinated by Labour backbencher Peter Mandelson TBWA won New Labour‚Äôs account and worked on Tony Blair‚Äôs 2001 general election campaign. Hornby worked on the Labour Party‚Äôs advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2001 UK general election. Following the campaign, which saw Blair re-elected with 413 seats, Hornby set about founding an agency with TBWA‚Äôs former chief executive Simon Clemmow under the provisional title, Clemmow Hornby. Hornby offered Mandelson a role at his new agency in the hope that Mandelson‚Äôs involvement might win other high-profile accounts. Later, after Charles Inge joined the firm, Clemmow, Hornby, and Inge combine their surnames to create the name CHI. Upon leaving TBWA, Hornby struck an agreement, allowing him to take one of TBWA‚Äôs most valuable accounts, Sir Charles Dunstone, the former chairman of the mobile phone retailer, Carphone Warehouse. Dunstone allowed Hornby to run CHI from a loft above Carphone Warehouse‚Äôs Marlybone Road shop in Northwest London, effectively enabling Hornby to create an agency with little or no start-up costs and one major client. By 2004 CHI had new offices in Wardour Street, Soho. =The late 00s= Following a string of successful pitches, the agency developed a client base ranging from drinks companies to financial services to radio stations. When Hornby came to sell a 49.9% stake in the company to Sir Martin Sorrell, he did so for ¬£30 million. Following the deal, Hornby embarked on an acquisition spree. =The 2010s= Following his Sorrell deal and subsequent acquisition spree, Hornby added nine agencies to his portfolio and founded The&Partnership; as a holdings company for his newly acquired agencies. He adopted a similar model to many law firms, whereby the partners are owners in the business and work together for a single profit and loss statement. By 2013, the company employed 1,400 people internationally, partly aided by Hornby‚Äôs access to GroupM, the media buying arm of WPP plc, who at the time purchased approximately one-third of all British television advertising. Hornby remains the largest shareholder of the company, with a 22% stake. =Other work= After the former Carillion chairman, Philip Nevill Green stood down from Prince Harry‚Äôs Sentebale charity in 2018, the anti-HIV non-profit announced Hornby as its new chairman.

He matriculated at St Peter's Hall, Oxford in 1933, and read English Literature. His involvement with the Oxford Group came about through conversation with Kenneth Prebble. He left with a pass degree. Sisam was given a chance to work in film, as a volunteer, by Eric Parfit. It was on Bridgebuilders, about the Oxford Group outreach and anti-communist mission in Scandinavia. It led to further work in 1937 on Youth Marches On, set in Canada and England. At the beginning of World War II, Sisam was rejected for military service on health grounds. He worked in London for the Civil Defence Force. The shortage of film work led him to learn photography as a profession. After the war he was editor of New World News, an MRA magazine established in 1948.

This is the main LGBT rights organisation in Finland. Biography Kupila was assigned female at birth but experienced gender dysphoria from an early age. At the age of nineteen, he initiated the legal process of change of gender from female to male. As a condition for this, he first had to receive a psychiatric diagnosis of transsexuality which equates the condition to a mental disorder. In addition, Finland has a second legal requirement for gender change which is sterilization. Kupila refused this, and was denied a change in legal gender. In response, he began an international campaign involving Amnesty International to have the Finnish law changed as infringing his transgender rights. The latter he considered as an integral part of his overall human rights. This was despite LGBT rights in Finland being regarded as some of the most progressive in the world. The campaign ended in August 2017, when the Finnish government decided not to amend the law on gender transitions.

Midsummer Dance is an oil on canvas painting by the Swedish artist Anders Zorn from 1897. There are three versions of the painting, the most famous one is exhibited at Nationalmuseum in Stockholm. Another version, painted at the same time, is now exhibited at the Pushkin Museum in Moscow. A third version, commissioned by an American collector in 1903, is in a smaller format (117.5 x 90) and in private ownership.artsandculture.google.com The Painting depicts a traditional Swedish Midsummer celebration in the Province of Dalarna. In the background to the right there is a maypole with a Swedish flag at the top. The dancers are all wearing Folk costumes. In the House with a red gable the first morning light is reflected. The depicted village, Morkarlby outside Mora, is not far from Zorn's own birth place. After living abroad for several years, Zorn and his wife Emma moved back to Dalarna in 1896. In the following years he made great efforts to preserve the local folk music. The traditional Midsummer celebration had diminished in the Dalarna because of the religious revival that has emerged since the mid-19th century. To counteract this, Zorn annually donated a Maypole to Morkarlby. In his autobiographical notes, Zorn writes about how the idea for the painting was born: \\"This work was painted in June and part of July after sunset and I am pleased to have done it. I had just given Morkarlby a new maypole. It was painted red every Midsummer and I realised and still realise that it is my solemn duty to be present and to lead the dressing of said pole. My farmhand, dear Verner, was in charge of raising the maypole on the stroke of midnight on Midsummer night. Once it was up, a reel was played and people danced hand-in-hand around the maypole and the yards in an endless snake of youngsters. Then there was dancing in one of the yards until sunrise.

History  Pahala Kencana started its business in 1976 with the route Kudus ‚Äì Jakarta PP and Solo ‚Äì Jakarta PP. The dynamic situation of the business movement spurred Pahala Kencana to continue to expand its marketing operations area to reach several large and small cities in Sumatra, Java, Madura, Bali, and Lombok. In 1993, PK developed the Pahala Kencana Depository Services business, which initially only served destinations on the bus operating route, relied on the remaining passenger luggage space, and operated a few small vehicles as modes of delivery between goods. In the same year, PK established PT BPW Pahala Kencana Travel Bureau which later became better known as Pahala Tours & Travel. In 1997, PK operated a number of city bus fleets in Jakarta, and in 1998 Pahala Kencana resumed business by opening inter-city routes within the province (AKDP). In 2000, PT Pahala Kencana began to expand into the field of tourism transportation which included the provision of tourism buses and rental vehicles under the Nirwana Luxury Tourist Bus brand. In the same year, Pahala Kencana moved its headquarters from Kudus, Central Java to Jakarta. Then in 2005, PT Pahala Kencana developed an airplane ticket sales business that concentrated on selling airline tickets at low rates by establishing PT Nata Tours.

Ha! Crossing the borough La Baie, in Saguenay (city), in the administrative region of Saguenay‚ÄìLac- Saint-Jean, in Quebec, in Canada. The \\"rivi√®re √† Mars\\" is a tributary of the Saguenay River and has its source in the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve. This river to salmons was badly affected by the Saguenay Flood which occurred from July 19 to 21, 1996. From the mouth of the river, the \\"rivi√®re √† Mars\\" valley is served by the route 381 which cuts the river at La Baie, \\"chemin des Chutes\\" (north shore) and \\"Chemin Saint-Louis\\" (south shore), as well as by rail. Upstream, this valley is served by the Consol Paper road and a few other secondary forest roads for forestry and recreational tourism activities. Forestry is the main economic activity in this valley; industrial and port activities, second; recreational tourism activities, third. The surface of the Mars river is usually frozen from the beginning of December to the end of March, however the safe circulation on the ice is generally done from mid- December to mid-March.  Geography  Taking its source at the mouth of a small lake at above sea level in the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve, the \\"rivi√®re √† Mars\\" flows from south to northeast in a descent comprising several tumultuous and rugged segments. The \\"rivi√®re √† Mars\\" flows over with a drop of especially in the forest zone except the last segment of in industrial zone and urban at the end of the course, according to the following segments: Upper course of the rivi√®re √† Mars (segment of ) * to the north in a deep valley crossing Lac Turcotte (length: ; altitude: ) at its peak length, to its mouth; * north, to the confluence of the outlet of Edmond Lake (coming from the west); * towards the north by winding and collecting the discharge (coming from the east) of Lake Dusette, to the discharge (coming from the east) of Lake Stymphale; * to the north, collecting the discharge (coming from the east) from Lake Colon and forming sawtooth at the end of the segment, up to the discharge of a stream (coming from South); * towards the north, curving towards the northwest by collecting the outlet of lac des Caves and meandering at the end of the segment to the stream at Go√©land (coming from the south); * (or in a direct line) towards the northwest by forming numerous small streamers, until the confluence of the rivi√®re √† Mars North-West; Intermediate course of the rivi√®re √† Mars (segment of in forest area) * towards the northwest passing north of Mont aux Oiseaux (altitude: ) where a fire tower had been built, then forming a curve towards east before branching north to Bras de l'Enfer (rivi√®re √† Mars); * towards the north, passing between two mountains and forming a hook of towards the west, until the discharge (coming from the south-east) from Lac Noir; * north in a deep valley, to a bend in the river; * towards the north-west by forming a hook of towards the north, up to the outlet (coming from the south) of \\"Lac du Portage\\"; * to the north, collecting the outlet (coming from the east) of Lac Vert, the outlet (coming from the east) of \\"Petit lac Castule\\" and \\"Grand lac Castule\\", branching off towards northeast, to the confluence of the Bras d'Isa√Øe (coming from the west); Lower course of the rivi√®re √† Mars (segment of in forest area) * eastwards to the confluence of the Bras du Coco (coming from the south-east) * north-west to the outlet (coming from the east) of Lake Como; * towards the north-west crossing some rapids until the confluence of the La Grosse D√©charge (coming from the west); * towards the north-west crossing some rapids and forming a hook of towards the south-east, up to a bend in the river; * towards the northeast by forming a loop towards the northwest where a railway bridge is laid out and by forming a hook of towards the northeast at the end of the segment, either after having crossed the bridge from route 381, to the Rouge stream (coming from the west); * north-east in the La Baie borough, crossing a zone of rapids, passing under two road bridges and a railway bridge, to its mouth. The Mars River flows into the Baie des Ha! Ha! from the Saguenay fjord after crossing the borough of La Baie, in Saguenay (city). From there, the current crosses the Baie des Ha! Ha! Northeast on , then follow the course of the Saguenay River east on until Tadoussac where it merges with the Saint Lawrence estuary.  Aquatic fauna  The river offers fishing for Atlantic salmon and sea trout (anadromous Saguenay brook trout). Salmon fishing is wading and fly fishing only on the most easily accessible of river. From 1894 to 1935, the Price Brothers company operated a private fishing club on the river in Mars. In 1930, the construction of a dam limited access to salmon and allowed timber to float until 1952. Following major seeding and development work, including the creation of a fishway for salmon, the Association of sport fishermen of the Mars river was formed in 1983, and fishing reopened in 1992. Nowadays, Contact Nature Rivi√®re-√†-Mars is a non-profit organization which manages fishing on the √Ä Mars river and exploits the migratory pass with interpretation site of Atlantic salmon and sea trout. You can enjoy a salmon and sea trout interpretation trail, as well as a window for underwater observation of the salmon thanks to its migratory pass.

He found himself a partner ‚Äî Loki Leevahl ‚Äî to aid in his mission. He also ended up training his successors, Tesfia Fibel and Alice Tilake. He even came across the daughter of his former superior ‚Äî Felinella Socalent. On top of his growing list of responsibilities and frequent messes in dealing with these beauties, he resumes his research and continues to defeat the Fiends in secret.  Characters  = Main Characters = Alus Reigin The 16-year-old main protagonist is the series' strongest Magicmaster, serving the nation of Alpha. He started serving in the military at the age of six before he rose through the ranks. His affinity is Void meaning his magic is attribute-less, and he wields a custom and self-made AWR (Assist Weapon Recovery, i.e., Aura) \\"Night Mist\\", which comes in the form of a short-sword with chains imbued with magic. Alus was born with two different manas, which created his attribute-less disposition and unique abilities. He is yet to fully comprehend the mysteries surrounding his nature, which is why he devoted himself to magical research on top of his Magicmaster duties. He is a good researcher, performing self- research on magic at an early age to gain a better understanding of his abilities. However, being raised as an effective killing machine from an early age, Alus lacks of tact and understanding when it came to the subtleties of the heart. Despite his icy cold exterior, his personality is subtly changing, such as being able to read the mood of an event as he spends more time with the girls at the institute. Alus is currently a student at the Second Magical Institute. He works on his magic researches in his free time and sometimes responds to mission requests that comes directly from Governor-General Berwick Sarebian. He reports directly to the Governor-General. Loki Leevahl Alus's partner, Loki is a triple-digit Magicmaster and a double-digit Spotter. Spotters specialize in detecting fiends, and only double-digit Magicmasters or higher are assigned spotters as their partners. Apart from being an expert at Fiend's detection, she also is an excellent Magicmaster with combat experience. Like Alus, she was an orphan after losing her parents to the Fiends, and her hatred towards the fiend spurred her decision to join the military at a very young age. She uses a knife AWR and her affinity is the lightning attribute. She first met Alus at one of the Military training facility, albeit briefly. This short encounter left a significant impression on her to push forward and continue with the harsh training. Eventually, she would reencounter Alus when he saved her life on her first mission, which went awry back when she was a child. Since then, she decided that she would devote her entire life to Alus by being useful. When she learned of Alus's enrollment at the Institute, she immediately followed suit and eventually became his partner after undergoing a trial imposed by Alus. She is exceptionally loyal to Alus and tends to get jealous of the other girls when they get too close to him. She is adept at housework such as cleaning up the laboratory, indexing research paper works and even prepares meals for Alus. Initially, she did not get along with Tesfia and Alice. She was enraged with how Tesfia and Alice treated Alus, despite them being aware of Alus's status and predicament. She eventually warmed up and became more accepting of the two girls, when she realized Tesfia and Alice are working hard not just for their own sake, but for others as well. She has feelings for Alus and competes for his affection. Tesfia Fible Tesfia is a First-year student and top novice Magicmaster of her year at the Institute, currently being trained by Alus. She is from one of the noble families from Alpha. Her affinity is ice magic, and she uses a katana AWR that she inherited from her family. Tesfia has a blunt and hot-headed personality, but deep down is gentle, diligent, and hardworking. When she first met Alus, they both started on bad terms and she initially looked down on him. After she lost to Alus in a mock battle and discovered Alus's true identity, her opinion of him took a turn for better. She is gradually drawn to him. Alice Tilake A First-year student, she is also one of the top novice Magicmaster of her year at the Institute. Currently being trained by Alus, Alice is cheerful and maternal with a dark past. As a child, she participated in one of Godma's unethical experiments on augmented humans that was sanctioned by the government. Due to an unfortunate event, she lost her parents and became an orphan. She became close another test subject named Melissa. Alice is a very close and dear friend of Tesfia. Her affinity is light magic, and due to defects in her mana information as an unintended result of the experiment, she is also capable of wielding attribute-less magic to a certain degree, albeit inferior to Alus. She is extremely grateful that she met Tesfia, Loki, Felinella and Alus as they brought light to her darkened world. Like the other girls, she has feelings for Alus though she is the timidest among all. Felinella Socalent A Triple-Digit Magicmaster, Felinella is a talented Second-year student in the Institute as well as the girls' dormitory supervisor, meaning she is senior to Tesfia and Alice. She is the daughter of Lord Vizaist Socalent, one of the prominent noble families in Alpha, and she is very popular throughout the noble society of the seven nations. She would occasionally assist her father in missions under his supervision as auxiliary personnel. She has romantic feelings for Alus, trying to propose to Alus through her father. After the subjugation mission against Godma, she realized winning Alus' heart through her father's influence would only lead to a one-sided love. Thus, she resolved to woo Alus herself. = Nation of Alpha = Berwick Sarebian Governor-General of Alpha's Military and Alus's current direct superior, he is aware of Alus' secrets and circumstances. Berwick is the one responsible behind Alus's current living arrangement with the Institute. Sisty 'Witch' Nexophia Sisty Nexophia is the principal of Second Magic Institute and a former Single-digit Magicmaster. 'Witch' is her moniker. At her peak, she was ranked 9th but eventually retired from active duty due to certain circumstances ‚Äî an unspoken rule among the seven nations ‚Äî each nation should only have one Single-digit Magicmaster to maintain political balance. Since Alpha had two single-digit Magicmaster in the form of Sisty and Alus, Sisty opted for retirement since she was older than Alus. She became the principal shortly after retiring from active duty. Vizaist Socalent Vizaist was previously Alus Reigin's superior in the temporary special forces. Head of one of the most distinguished Noble families in Alpha, he holds the title of 'Lord' with the rank of captain. He is currently the head of the Elite Intelligence department. Lord Vizaist is also the father to Felinella Socalent, whom he loves to dote on. He thinks highly of her daughter's potential and Alus, even offering his daughter's hand in marriage to Alus. = Others = Godma Barhong A mad scientist with no regard to ethics and human life, he is the source of all the dreadful things in Alice and Melissa's life. He began a human augmentation experiment years ago, but the government eventually blacklisted his research. He has been on the run from the military and conducted his experiment under the radar. While on the run, he secretly receives fundings, research equipment, and materials from a powerful yet unknown individual ‚Äî with an alias 'Enouve' ‚Äî to continue his illegal research. Melissa Alice's old childhood friend that she befriended while she was part of Godma's cruel experiment.

When she was appointed in 1927, she was the first female police surgeon in the United Kingdom. Early life Nesta Helen Perry was born on 9 July 1892 in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England to Herbert Edward Perry, and Edith Grafton Hopkins. Her father was a mineral water manufacturer, and later became a Unitarian minister. She studied medicine at the University of Manchester, graduating in 1916. After graduating, she worked as a house officer at Nottingham General Hospital. Career She returned to Manchester and worked in a number of local hospitals including Pendlebury Children's Hospital, Beckett Hospital in Barnsley, and the Salvation Army's maternity hospital, Crossley Hospital. She later worked at the Manchester Babies' Hospital (renamed in 1935 as Duchess of York Hospital for Babies) as an honorary registrar. Founded in 1914 by Catherine Chisholm, the hospital's doctors were all women. Perry later became an honorary physician at the hospital. She was an early member of the Medical Women's Federation, which was founded in 1917. During the 1920s to 1940s, the organisation campaigned for the introduction of women as police surgeons to examine victims of sexual assault. Manchester City councillor Annie Lee joined the Watch Committee who oversaw the Manchester City Police, and in 1927 convinced the committee to appoint a woman police surgeon specifically to examine women and children. On 1 August, Wells was appointed to the role, the first in the United Kingdom. Her part-time role primarily involved the examination of women and children who had been suspected of being victims of sexual assault, rape, and incest. However, she was also responsible for the health of the city's women police officers. Wells also continued to campaign for more female police surgeons and police officers. She retired in 1954. In 1958, Wells published a survey in the British Medical Journal of 1,959 suspected sexual offence cases which had been referred to her. In a significant majority of the cases, the victims were under the age of 16. Personal life She married Lionel Wraith Wells in 1923. He was a mechanical engineer. They had two daughters. Wells died on 17 February 1986 in the village of Holmes Chapel, Cheshire.
