Hanna Reitsch in Fw 61 V2 An Mil V-12 at Monino Central Air Force Museum (Moscow) Animation Transverse rotor rotorcraft have two large horizontal rotor assemblies mounted side by side. Single-rotor helicopters (unicopters) need an additional tail rotor or tail exhaust to neutralize the reactional angular momentum produced by the main rotor. Transverse rotor helicopters, however, use counter-rotating rotors, with each cancelling out the other's torque. Counter-rotating rotor blades also won't collide with and destroy each other if they flex into the other rotor's pathway. In addition, transverse rotor configuration has the advantage of higher payload with shorter blades, since there are two sets working to provide lift. Also, all of the power from the engines can be used for lift, whereas a single-rotor helicopter must divert part of its engine power to generate tail thrust. Transverse rotor design with rotatable nacelles are known as tiltrotors while designs where the whole wing rotates are known as tiltwings.

Their name was chosen when Ben was at Hillsong Conference and at offering time only had 1 dollar, his mum's dollar. They originally intended to change the name after CTC but it just stuck.http://www.soulpurpose.co.nz/music/bands-artists/mumsdollar-goodness/ Since then Mumsdollar has become one of the biggest bands in the kiwi music scene. They have also released their album A Beautiful Life in Japan. Mumsdollar were also one of the favourites at the New Zealand Christian music festival Parachute. In 2009 their Album \\"Ruins\\" won a Vodafone New Zealand Music Award for \\"Best Gospel/Christian Album\\" beating Parachute Band, The Ember Days and Primalband. It also Charted at #15 on the New Zealand Album charts in late January 2009.http://www.biggie.co.nz/editorial/news/weeks_music_chart.html Break Up In 2009 Mumsdollar announced that they would be breaking up at the end of the year due to lead singer Ben Claxton going on his OE.

The prototypes were evaluated by the United States Air Force and Army, but the crash of the second test aircraft led to cancelling the project. Design and development Given the company designation PV-15, the tandem-rotor helicopter was designed by company founder Frank Piasecki. The design was publicly shown for the first time on 15 September 1953 at the Philadelphia airport.Associated Press, \\"Ready To Pick Up And Go\\", San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Thursday 16 September 1953, Volume LX, Number 14, page 14. Operational history =Crash= On 5 January 1956, the second YH-16 test aircraft crashed while returning to Philadelphia from a test flight over New Jersey.Piasecki Helicopter Corporation newsletter, January 1956 The cause of the crash was later determined to be the aft slip ring, which carried flight data from the instrumented rotor blades to the data recorders in the cabin. The slip ring bearings seized, and the resultant torque load severed the instrumentation standpipe inside the aft rotor shaft. A segment of this steel standpipe tilted over and came into contact with the interior of the aluminum rotor shaft, scribing a deepening groove into it. The rotor shaft eventually failed in flight, which in turn led to the aft blades and forward blades desynchronizing and colliding. The aircraft was a total loss; the two test pilots, Harold Peterson and George Callahan, were killed. This led to the cancellation not only of the YH-16, but also the planned 69-passenger YH-16B version.

After work, Polly walks home and wonders what she will do to make ends meet. On a step, she finds an abandoned baby in a blanket and instinctively picks it up to comfort it. As she bends over, the door behind the step opens and a woman ushers Polly and the baby inside. Polly has not noticed the sign that indicates the door belongs to an orphanage. When she denies the baby is hers inside, the staff disbelieve her, having experienced countless women ashamed to admit that they bore a child out of wedlock. Polly explains that she has just lost her job at J.B Merlin & Son's and insists there is no way that she will care for a baby that is not hers. After she leaves, the head of the orphanage decides to intervene on her behalf, knowing the Merlins to be charitable. He convinces the firm to hire Polly back, and she is summoned to a meeting with Dan Merlin (Fisher) the son of the titular owner. Dan informs her that she will be hired back at $10 more per week and that a gift will be delivered to her apartment later that night. When the baby arrives, Polly is flabbergasted. She convinces a friend to help her deliver the baby back to Dan at his home on East 63rd Street. They leave the baby in the care of Dan's butler, whom Dan enlists to help him return the baby to Polly. They track her down to a dance hall where she is hoping to win a prize. Dan gets into a scuffle and gets thrown out. So he goes to Polly's apartment and waits for her there with the baby. Forced to care for the baby, Polly makes do and grows fond of him. She names the child John, and Dan checks in on her from time to time. On New Year's Eve, Dan is stood up by his date, because he had forgotten to call her earlier. He arranges for Polly's landlady to watch John while they go out together. He takes her to the department store to get an outfit for a night out on the town. When he drops her off back at home, he jokes that she is fired so that he can kiss her. Meanwhile, J.B. Merlin has been misinformed that he is a grandfather, mistaking John to be Dan's son. He begins to make arrangements for Dan to have full custody of the child. Polly panics at the thought of losing John. So she pretends that her landlady's nephew, who is visiting from Harvard, is John's real father. Dan produces a store employee to pretend he is the father. The ensuing confusion leads to a full confession of love from Dan and a happy union for the new family, and J.B. is convinced the boy is his grandson.

He was a Whig in politics, and known for his attacks on High Church views, writing on the subordination of the Church of England to the state. After the accession of George I of England in 1714 he was in the royal favour and influential. Charles Trimnell Life He was the son of another Charles Trimnell (c. 1630–1702), rector of Abbots Ripton, Huntingdonshire. He was educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1681, and graduated B.A. in 1688. Sir John Trevor, Master of the Rolls, gave him an appointment on his graduation, as preacher of the Rolls chapel. He travelled to the Netherlands with Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland in 1689; Sunderland was a Roman Catholic convert of the end of the reign of James II, who returned to England in 1691 as an Anglican Whig, employing Trimnell as chaplain at Althorp. He was rector of Bodington, in Sunderland's gift, in 1694, and of Brington, the local parish of Althorp, in 1696. In 1698 he became archdeacon of Norwich. A royal chaplain under Queen Anne, he became rector of Southmere in 1704, and of St Giles' Church, Norwich in 1705. He was rector of St James, Westminster in 1706, and Bishop of Norwich in 1708. In March 1710 he spoke forcefully in the House of Lords for the impeachment of Henry Sacheverell. He preached in 1712 to the House of Lords what Jonathan Swift called a \\"terrible Whig sermon\\" in the Journal to Stella, sufficiently controversial that the Lords declined to thank him and order it printed. He was in high favour on the accession of George I in 1714.Rowan Strong, Anglicanism and the British Empire C.1700–1850 (2007), p. 38. He became Clerk of the Closet that same year and Bishop of Winchester in 1721. The Black Act of 1723 was passed at his instigation, to deter poaching of deer at Bishop's Waltham. Family By his wife Henrietta Maria, daughter of William Talbot, bishop of Durham, he had two sons who died in infancy. She died in 1716, and in 1719 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edmund Wynne of Nostell, Yorkshire, second baronet, and widow of Joseph Taylor of the Temple.

It separates St Austell Bay from the estuary of the River Fowey and is marked by a large tower used to aid navigation of ships approaching the local harbours. The nearest town is Fowey. The western point of the headland is called Little Gribbin. Gribbin Head is the most southerly part of the parish of Fowey. To the north, and facing west across St Austell Bay is the small village of Polkerris, beyond which is the harbour at Par. To the east is Polridmouth cove and the Fowey estuary, where the town of Fowey itself is situated. Inland, to the north, is the Menabilly estate,Ordnance Survey 1:25000 Explorer Map 107 built for the Rashleigh family but later home to author Daphne du Maurier.

The South West Coast Path passes around Gribbin Head on its way from Minehead in Somerset to Poole in Dorset. Gribbin Tower Gribben Tower managed by the National Trust The high square beacon tower was erected by Trinity House in 1832 to distinguish the Gribben from Dodman Point and St Anthony’s Head, and thus make navigation into Fowey and the harbours of St Austell Bay safer. It was never lighted, but is painted in broad red and white bands as a daymark. It has been a Grade II Listed Building since 1974. The tower featured in the first episode of the BBC TV series The Coroner Wildlife and ecology Once part of the Menabilly Estate and owned by the Rashleigh family, grazing was removed from the site in 1967 and the headland reverted to scrub. Since 1988 the National Trust has been removing the scrub, and re-introduced grazing by cows owned by a tenant farmer. A herb rich grassland including early purple orchid (Orchis mascula) now surrounds the tower. The Rashleigh's planted two small woodlands for cover and the ground is covered in ramsons (Allium ursinum) and other flowering plants in the spring.

The method was first published in November 1936 by Shinn Taniguchi its namesake, Hardy Cross, a structural engineering professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. The Hardy Cross method is an adaptation of the Moment distribution method, which was also developed by Hardy Cross as a way to determine the forces in statically indeterminate structures. The introduction of the Hardy Cross method for analyzing pipe flow networks revolutionized municipal water supply design. Before the method was introduced, solving complex pipe systems for distribution was extremely difficult due to the nonlinear relationship between head loss and flow. The method was later made obsolete by computer solving algorithms employing the Newton-Raphson method or other numerical methods that eliminate the need to solve nonlinear systems of equations by hand. History In 1930, Hardy Cross published a paper called \\"Analysis of Continuous Frames by Distributing Fixed-End Moments\\" in which he described the moment distribution method, which would change the way engineers in the field performed structural analysis. The moment distribution method was used to determine the forces in statically indeterminate structures and allowed for engineers to safely design structures from the 1930s through the 1960s, till the computer oriented methods. In November 1936, Cross applied the same geometric method to solving pipe network flow distribution problems, and published a paper called \\"Analysis of flow in networks of conduits or conductors.\\" Derivation The Hardy Cross method is an application of continuity of flow and continuity of potential to iteratively solve for flows in a pipe network. In the case of pipe flow, conservation of flow means that the flow in is equal to the flow out at each junction in the pipe. Conservation of potential means that the total directional head loss along any loop in the system is zero (assuming that a head loss counted against the flow is actually a head gain). Hardy Cross developed two methods for solving flow networks. Each method starts by maintaining either continuity of flow or potential, and then iteratively solves for the other. =Assumptions= The Hardy Cross method assumes that the flow going in and out of the system is known and that the pipe length, diameter, roughness and other key characteristics are also known or can be assumed. The method also assumes that the relation between flow rate and head loss is known, but the method does not require any particular relation to be used. In the case of water flow through pipes, a number of methods have been developed to determine the relationship between head loss and flow. The Hardy Cross method allows for any of these relationships to be used. The general relationship between head loss and flow is: :h_f = k \\\\cdot Q^{n} where k is the head loss per unit flow and n is the flow exponent. In most design situations the values that make up k, such as pipe length, diameter, and roughness, are taken to be known or assumed and thus the value of k can be determined for each pipe in the network. The values that make up k and the value of n change depending on the relation used to determine head loss. However, all relations are compatible with the Hardy Cross method. {border=\\"3\\" style=\\"margin-left: 3em; text-align: center;\\" -  Head loss equation  Relation  k  n -  Hazen-Williams equation h_f = L \\\\cdot \\\\frac{10.67 \\\\quad Q^{1.85}}{C^{1.85}\\\\quad d^{4.87}} L \\\\cdot \\\\frac{10.67}{C^{1.85}\\\\quad d^{4.87}} 1.85 -  Darcy-Weisbach equation h_f = \\\\frac{8 f L Q^2}{g \\\\pi^2 d^5} align=\\"center\\"L \\\\cdot \\\\frac{8 f}{g \\\\pi^2 d^5} 2 } It is also worth noting that the Hardy Cross method can be used to solve simple circuits and other flow like situations. In the case of simple circuits, :V = K \\\\cdot I is equivalent to :h_f = k \\\\cdot Q^{n}. By setting the coefficient k to K, the flow rate Q to I and the exponent n to 1, the Hardy Cross method can be used to solve a simple circuit. However, because the relation between the voltage drop and current is linear, the Hardy Cross method is not necessary and the circuit can be solved using non-iterative methods. =Method of balancing heads= The method of balancing heads uses an initial guess that satisfies continuity of flow at each junction and then balances the flows until continuity of potential is also achieved over each loop in the system. Proof (r denotes k) The following proof is taken from Hardy Cross's paper, “Analysis of flow in networks of conduits or conductors.”, and can be verified by National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning Water and Wastewater Engineering page, and Fundamentals of Hydraulic Engineering Systems by Robert J. Houghtalen. If the initial guess of flow rates in each pipe is correct, the change in head over a loop in the system, \\\\Sigma r Q^{n} would be equal to zero. However, if the initial guess is not correct, then the change in head will be non-zero and a change in flow, \\\\Delta Q must be applied. The new flow rate, Q = Q_0 + \\\\Delta Q is the sum of the old flow rate and some change in flow rate such that the change in head over the loop is zero. The sum of the change in head over the new loop will then be \\\\Sigma r (Q_0 + \\\\Delta Q)^{n} = 0. The value of \\\\Sigma r (Q_0 + \\\\Delta Q)^{n} can be approximated using the Taylor expansion. :\\\\Sigma r (Q_0 + \\\\Delta Q)^{n} = \\\\Sigma r (Q_0^n + n Q_0^{n-1} \\\\Delta Q + ...) = 0 For a small \\\\Delta Q compared to Q_0 the additional terms vanish, leaving: :\\\\Sigma r (Q_0^n + n Q_0^{n-1} \\\\Delta Q) = 0 And solving for \\\\Delta Q :\\\\Sigma r Q_0^n = -\\\\Sigma n r Q_0^{n-1} \\\\Delta Q :\\\\Delta Q = -\\\\frac{\\\\Sigma r Q_0^n}{\\\\Sigma n r Q_0^{n-1}} The change in flow that will balance the head over the loop is approximated by \\\\Delta Q = -\\\\frac{\\\\Sigma r Q_0^n}{\\\\Sigma n r Q_0^{n-1}}. However, this is only an approximation due to the terms that were ignored from the Taylor expansion. The change in head over the loop may not be zero, but it will be smaller than the initial guess. Multiple iterations of finding a new \\\\Delta Q will approximate to the correct solution. Process The method is as follows: #Guess the flows in each pipe, making sure that the total in flow is equal to the total out flow at each junction. (The guess doesn't have to be good, but a good guess will reduce the time it takes to find the solution.) #Determine each closed loop in the system. #For each loop, determine the clockwise head losses and counter-clockwise head losses. Head loss in each pipe is calculated using h_f = r Q^{n}. Clockwise head losses are from flows in the clockwise direction and likewise for counter-clockwise. #Determine the total head loss in the loop, \\\\Sigma r Q^{n}, by subtracting the counter-clockwise head loss from the clockwise head loss. #For each loop, find \\\\Sigma n r Q^{n - 1} without reference to direction (all values should be positive). #The change in flow is equal to \\\\frac{\\\\Sigma r Q^{n}}{\\\\Sigma n r Q^{n - 1}}. #If the change in flow is positive, apply it to all pipes of the loop in the counter- clockwise direction. If the change in flow is negative, apply it to all pipes of the loop in the clockwise direction. #Continue from step 3 until the change in flow is within a satisfactory range. =Method of balancing flows (section incomplete)= The method of balancing flows uses an initial guess that satisfies continuity of potential over each loop and then balances the flows until continuity of flow is also achieved at each junction. Advantages of the Hardy Cross method =Simple mathematics= The Hardy Cross method is useful because it relies on only simple mathematics, circumventing the need to solve a system of equations. Without the Hardy Cross methods, engineers would have to solve complex systems of equations with variable exponents that cannot easily be solved by hand. =Self correcting= The Hardy Cross method iteratively corrects for the mistakes in the initial guess used to solve the problem. Subsequent mistakes in calculation are also iteratively corrected. If the method is followed correctly, the proper flow in each pipe can still be found if small mathematical errors are consistently made in the process. As long as the last few iterations are done with attention to detail, the solution will still be correct. In fact, it is possible to intentionally leave off decimals in the early iterations of the method to run the calculations faster. Example An example pipe flow network The Hardy Cross method can be used to calculate the flow distribution in a pipe network. Consider the example of a simple pipe flow network shown at the right. For this example, the in and out flows will be 10 liters per second. We will consider n to be 2, and the head loss per unit flow r, and initial flow guess for each pipe as follows: {border=\\"3\\" style=\\"margin-left: 3em; text-align: center;\\" -  Pipe  Q12  Q13  Q23  Q24  Q34 -  r 1 5 1 5 1 -  Q guess (L/s) 5 5 0 5 5 } We solve the network by method of balancing heads, following the steps outlined in method process above. 1\\\\. The initial guesses are set up so that continuity of flow is maintained at each junction in the network. 2\\\\. The loops of the system are identified as loop 1-2-3 and loop 2-3-4. 3\\\\. The head losses in each pipe are determined. {border=\\"3\\" style=\\"margin-left: 3em; text-align: center;\\" -  Loop 1-2-3  Q12  Q13  Q23 -  Head loss = rQ^2 25 125 0 -  Direction Clockwise Counter-clockwise Clockwise } For loop 1-2-3, the sum of the clockwise head losses is 25 and the sum of the counter-clockwise head losses is 125. {border=\\"3\\" style=\\"margin-left: 3em; text-align: center;\\" -  Loop 2-3-4  Q23  Q24  Q34 -  Head loss = rQ^2 0 125 25 -  Direction Counter-clockwise Clockwise Counter-clockwise } For loop 2-3-4, the sum of the clockwise head losses is 125 and the sum of the counter-clockwise head losses is 25. 4\\\\. The total clockwise head loss in loop 1-2-3 is 25-125 = -100. The total clockwise head loss in loop 2-3-4 is 125-25 = 100. 5\\\\. The value of \\\\Sigma n r Q^{n - 1} is determined for each loop. It is found to be 60 in both loops (due to symmetry), as shown in the figure. 6\\\\. The change in flow is found for each loop using the equation \\\\frac{\\\\Sigma r Q^{n}}{\\\\Sigma n r Q^{n - 1}}. For loop 1-2-3, the change in flow is equal to -100/60 = -1.66 and for loop 2-3-4 the change in flow is equal to 100/60 = 1.66. 7\\\\. The change in flow is applied across the loops. For loop 1-2-3, the change in flow is negative so its absolute value is applied in the clockwise direction. For loop 2-3-4, the change in flow is positive so its absolute value is applied in the counter-clockwise direction. For pipe 2-3, which is in both loops, the changes in flow are cumulative. {border=\\"3\\" style=\\"margin- left: 3em; text-align: center;\\" -  Pipe  Q12  Q13  Q23  Q24  Q34 -  Q (L/s) 6.66 3.33 3.33 3.33 6.66 } The process then repeats from step 3 until the change in flow becomes sufficiently small or goes to zero. 3\\\\. The total head loss in Loop 1-2-3 is {border=\\"3\\" style=\\"margin-left: 3em; text-align: center;\\" -  Loop 1-2-3  Q12  Q13  Q23 -  Head loss = rQ^2 44.4 55.5 11.1 -  Direction Clockwise Counter-clockwise Clockwise } Notice that the clockwise head loss is equal to the counter-clockwise head loss. This means that the flow in this loop is balanced and the flow rates are correct. The total head loss in loop 2-3-4 will also be balanced (again due to symmetry). {border=\\"3\\" style=\\"margin-left: 3em; text-align: center;\\" -  Loop 2-3-4  Q23  Q24  Q34 -  Head loss = rQ^2 11.1 55.5 44.4 -  Direction Counter- clockwise Clockwise Counter-clockwise } In this case, the method found the correct solution in one iteration. For other networks, it may take multiple iterations until the flows in the pipes are correct or approximately correct.

Ratu Mara's father was Ratu Vuibureta (half brother of Ratu Tanoa Visawaqa) of Bau, who was the son of Ratu Banuve, Vunivalu of Bau. He was thus not only a potential contender for the title of Vunivalu of Bau, but vasulevu , from which came many of the great canoes on which Bau's naval might rested. His mother was Roko Mere Veisaca of Lakeba in Lau. Ratu Mara was married to Adi Loaloakubou, daughter of Ratu Tanoa Visawaqa and Adi Talatoko of Somosomo. They had one son, Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi I, who became the father of Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna and others. His grandmother was Adi Talatoka, who was the daughter of Ratu Yavala (Tui Cakau) of Somosomo and Adi Levulevu of the Roko Tui Bau Royal Court. Adi Levulevu and Adi Savusavu (Ratu Cakobau's mother) were sisters. Ratu Mara's Legacy Ratu Mara won fame by sailing his canoe to Tonga, an act of unprecedented audacity for a Fijian seafarer. Returning to Fiji with Ma'afu in 1847, he finally fell out with Ratu Cakobau and was forced to take refuge with Qaraniqio of Rewa. He allied with him and other chiefs, including Koroi Ravulo of Vusaradave and Tui Levuka in a formidable coalition dedicated to the destruction of Ratu Cakobau. He waged guerilla campaigns against Ratu Cakobau until 1859 when he was gulled into surrendering himself in Bau, only to be hanged the next day by order of his cousin, Ratu Cakobau. The wounds caused by the hanging of Ratu Mara were secretly nursed by his descendants, but it eventually surfaced during the time of his grandson, Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna when he removed himself and his younger brother, Ratu Tiale Vuiyasawa and his sisters away from the Tui Kaba Registration of Births (Vola ni Kawa Bula) to that of the Vuanirewa Registration in Lakeba, Lau under their mother, Adi Litiana Maopa, who was the sister of the Tui Nayau, Ratu Finau.

The inauguration marked the commencement of the first four-year term of Thomas Jefferson as President and only four-year term of Aaron Burr as Vice President. Jefferson was sworn in by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall. Background Jefferson was the nation's second Vice President under President John Adams, and ran against him as a Democratic-Republican in the 1800 presidential election with campaign manager Aaron Burr. Back in those times, the person who came in first would be president and the person who came in second would be vice president. Burr and Jefferson tied in the Electoral College, so the choice was thrown to the House of Representatives, where Alexander Hamilton helped swing the vote in Jefferson's favor on the 36th ballot. Inauguration It was a mild day in Washington, D.C., the first time an inauguration had been held in the city, with a High Noon temperature estimated at 55 degrees Fahrenheit. That morning an artillery company on Capitol Hill had shots fired to welcome the daybreak, and in a first for a newspaper, Jefferson gave a copy of his speech to the National Intelligencer for it to be published and available right after delivery. The theme of his address was reconciliation after his bitterly partisan election.Jenkinson, Clay S. \\"Jefferson Watch: The Inauguration.\\" Audio podcast. The Thomas Jefferson Hour. The Thomas Jefferson Hour, 26 Jan. 2017. Web. 27 Jan. 2017. Jefferson was lodging at Conrad and McMunn's boarding house on the south side of the Capitol building, and at roughly 10:00 am the Alexandria company of riflemen marched to the intersection of New Jersey Avenue and C Street. Jefferson, dressed according to a reporter as \\"a plain citizen without any distinctive badge of office,\\" became the first president to walk rather than ride a carriage to the ceremony, setting off around noon with some congressmen, District marshals, and military officers from Alexandria, Virginia. He delivered a 1,721-word speech in the United States Capitol's Senate chamber, and then took the oath of office, administered by Chief Justice John Marshall. In what would become standard practice, the Marine Band played for the first time at the inauguration. Outgoing President John Adams, distraught over his loss of the election as well as the death of his son Charles Adams to alcoholism, did not attend the inauguration. He left the President's House at 4 a.m. in the early morning on the early public stagecoach for Baltimore. This was the first time an outgoing President would not attend his successor's inauguration.

They contain either a significant amount of artefacts (something in the soil recognizably made or extracted from the earth by humans), some sort of geotechnical liner, or are sealed by technic hard rock (hard material created by humans, having properties unlike natural rock). They include soils from wastes (landfills, sludge, cinders, mine spoils and ashes), pavements with their underlying unconsolidated materials, soils with geomembranes and constructed soils in human-made materials. However, Technosols can also refer to a situation in which normal soil, such as a Chernozem, has been moved to a new location to act as a fill. If this fill is less than 50 cm, then the soil is called a Technosol. If fill material is greater than 50 cm deep, then the fill is designated by the original soil used to create the fill, in our example, a Chernozem. Technosols are often referred to as urban or mine soils. They are recognized in the new Russian soil classification system as Technogenic Superficial Formations. Technosols are developed on all kinds of materials made or exposed by human activity that otherwise would not occur at the Earth’s surface. They occur mostly in urban and industrial areas, usually in small areas, and can be associated with other soil groups in a complex pattern. They are closely related to Anthrosols, which are soils created by the long term addition of organic matter to a soil, such as an old urban garden. Most of the research on anthropogenic soils describe specific aspects of their biology, chemistry or physical properties, cultural heritage and human geography, erosion, wastes, pollution, fertilizer management, taxonomy. Very few of them, try to answer to the question: How fast do they start pedogenesis (viz., differentiating horizons)? A Technosol could differentiate A and O horizons at rates of more than one centimeter per year. Technosols are found throughout the world, e.g. at or near cities, roads, mines, refuse dumps, oil spills and coal fly ash deposits. These soils are more likely to be contaminated than other soils. Many Technosols have to be treated with care as they may contain toxic substances resulting from industrial processes.

Since 1973, the organisation investigates multinational corporations and the consequences of their activities for people and the environment around the world. SOMO has expertise in: # Sectors and value chains # Corporate research # Corporate accountability # Economic reform The main sectors under research by SOMO are the electronics, energy & water, minerals, agriculture & food, clothing, pharmaceuticals and the financial sectors.  History  = Establishment = In the early 1970s, large groups of Dutch people declared themselves in solidarity with the reform politics of the Chilean President Allende. At the time, the process of democratising the Chilean economy was threatened by the manipulations of multinational - mainly American - corporations with interests in Chile. The violent overthrow of the Allende government in 1973 elicited mass fury against the multinationals. Several Third World organisations and sympathisers decided to establish a research bureau to monitor the activities and interests of these multinational companies. This led, in 1973, to the establishment of Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO). Two of the organisations involved in setting up SOMO were X-Y Beweging and Sjaloom. X-Y and Sjaloom originally financed the wages and other costs of the first researcher. Later on, the growing SOMO organisation was funded for many years partly by subsidies from NCO (now NCDO). In its early days, SOMO’s main focus was on developing countries. However, from 1975 on, SOMO carried out research in support of workers in the Netherlands who were employed by multinational companies. SOMO provided publications and training for works councils and trade union executive groups of almost all the major multinationals which had their head offices in the Netherlands. Many SOMO employees acted as experts for works councils of Dutch companies during restructuring, mergers and reorganisations. The rise of European Works Councils (EWCs) meant that – logically – SOMO had acquired a new, related, field of operation. Drawing up company profiles of multinational companies and providing support in setting up EWCs became a core field of SOMO in the 1980s and 1990s. Research into multinational companies and the business sectors dominated by them was also becoming an important field for research. = Change of work = Around the turn of the millennium, work for the works councils decreased, leaving primarily the work focusing on developing countries. Since the end of the 1990s, research work has focused primarily on the themes of Corporate Social Responsibility, labour relationships in developing countries and international trade and investment. Commissions are obtained via subsidies issued by the Dutch government and European government bodies. SOMO’s commissioning parties are trade unions, development organisations and other social organisations. = Establishing networks = The development of the internet is ensuring a wide availability of information, which has meant that the role of SOMO has changed since the 1990s. The added value of SOMO is, on the one hand, carrying out (or commissioning) research into production and labour conditions in various production chains, and on the other on strengthening cooperation between organisations which want to influence businesses and policymakers. By combining research and network coordination, SOMO wants to promote the integration of knowledge and action. SOMO coordinates various networks (CSR Platform, OECD Watch, Coalition for Trade and Development, GoodElectronics). SOMO also represents various consortia (makeITfair and Towards Tax Justice) and is also involved in the European Coalition for Corporate Justice (ECCJ) and Tax Justice Network NL. As an extension of its research and network coordination, SOMO is also focusing more and more on increasing the capacity of southern NGOs (by organising workshops, training courses and developing research methods) and coordinating lobbying and influencing policy. In the period 2005-2010, the focus was on working conditions and the environment in production sectors, along with initiatives covering economic themes, such as ‘tax justice’ and reforming the financial markets. = From 2010 = The intended objectives of SOMO were reformulated in 2010: * The influence of social organisations on multinationals is growing. * The policy and practice of businesses serve sustainable and social development. * Government regulation is targeted at a fair distribution of prosperity and sustainability.  Goals  = Mission = SOMO strives toward global economic development that is sustainable and fair and toward the elimination of the structural causes of poverty, environmental problems, exploitation and inequality. Through research targeted at achieving sustainable change and strengthening cooperation, SOMO seeks to offer social organisations worldwide, especially those in developing countries, the opportunity to promote sustainable alternatives and to provide a counterweight to unsustainable strategies and practices of multinational corporations. = Vision = In SOMO's vision, strong civil society organisations are the initiators and drivers of positive change. Such change is initiated on the basis of reliable information and close cooperation and is guided by the principles of social and economic justice, sustainable development, transparency and fair distribution of power. = Strategy = In order to realise its mission, SOMO aims to strengthen the position of civil society organisations, workers and local communities. SOMO achieves this by integrating knowledge and action with regard to multinational corporations. SOMO presumes that in order to affect positive social change, it must employ four interrelated strategies. # provide civil society with access to reliable alternative information; # strengthen networks between like-minded organisations to create a broad societal base; # build the capacity of civil society organisations to conduct critical research and integrate the resulting knowledge with action and # engage relevant target groups with prospects for action.  Impact  SOMO’s research, network coordination, training and advice contribute to sustainable development. Highlights of the impact SOMO has had include: * Electronics companies have acknowledged their responsibility for the mining of minerals in developing countries. This is thanks to pressure from the European makeITfair campaign, a project initiated by SOMO. * The framework of international CSR standards has been strengthened through an update of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Key in this process was OECD Watch, a global network of NGOs set up and hosted by SOMO. * The need for improvements to regulations in the pharmaceutical industry has been put on the agenda at the EU level. SOMO joined forces with the Dutch NGO Wemos in this work aimed at increasing protection for patients involved in the testing of medicines in developing countries. * The Dutch government’s sustainability criteria have improved as a result of pressure from the MVO Platform (CSR Platform), a network coordinated and hosted by SOMO. * The Netherlands’ position as a tax haven (and the problems this creates for developing countries) is now on the public agenda due to the work of Tax Justice Network Netherlands, of which SOMO is a founding member. * For the first time ever, major tea producers have publicly acknowledged their responsibility for the abuses identified in the SOMO report Sustainability Issues in the Tea Sector. Several major tea producers now use sustainability certification schemes. * SOMO’s research on the energy sector and its collaboration with other NGOs such as Greenpeace has generated a political and public debate about the necessity and sustainability of new coal-fired power stations in the Netherlands. As a result, several planned coal-fired plants have had their construction delayed or been completely scrapped.

Overview Bind us Together describes the restoration movement (also referred to as the British New Church Movement) that occurred in the church during the second half of the 20th century. This set out to re-evaluate the nature of the church that Jesus originally intended to establish. Hence the subtitle of the book is ‘to be the church that Jesus really wants’. The movement's attempt to revitalise church life has made a significant positive impact on the church scene in the UK. It emphasised the importance of every believer's contribution to the church, the sharing of life through home groups, and lively worship. These features have now become a common part of many churches across all the Christian denominations. The movement also looked at the way church should be structured and this led to the development of apostolic teams and families of churches such as Newfrontiers. The book is in three parts. The first describes the history of the restoration movement from the perspective of someone who was intimately involved with the development of a large restoration church in Southampton. The second part takes a fresh look at what can be gleaned from the Bible on the nature of church life. Finally the book addresses the question of the next key challenges for the church. It makes the hypothesis that unity between Christians should be a principal focus for the way ahead. It proposes that in each locality there should be just one Christian church comprising all believers in that area working together in harmony. The book presents a challenge to church leaders to re-consider their priorities in moving forward and a message to all Christians that Jesus really cares about how they relate together in church. Author and publication Alongside his church role, Fleming is a Professor of Nuclear Medicine Physics at the University of Southampton. His book is published by Thankful Books who charge authors for \\"the design and production of the finished books\\" so at least one review describes it as self-published.

Early life Murray was born to a wealthy immigrant family in Alexandria, Virginia on November 6, 1789. He was the son of Martha (née McClenahan) Murray and Dr. John Boyles Murray, who moved to Virginia in 1760. His paternal grandfather was Sir James Murray, Lord Philiphaugh. His Presbyterian lineage was descended from the royal Stewarts through the ubiquitous clan of Murray. His mother's family, that of Martha McClenahan, had been associated with the history of the Siege of Derry. Rev. McClenahan had been one of the Apprentice Boys supporters, when they marched out to meet King James army. In 1800, when only a boy, Murray went to Norfolk, England, and caught a glimpse of the hero Admiral Nelson touring through his home city of Norwich. When only a small boy he had been warned of his Scots ancestry. He toured Philiphaugh, Scotland. He never forgot the supremacy of the seas of the Royal Navy, and vowed to help the President build a strong US Navy. Career James was an early entrant in the New York Militia, replacing his gun-shy uncle in the War of 1812. Murray's service was distinguished and intelligent. Through his impressive revolutionary connections he rose quickly to become a Colonel. He was very business-minded and commercially astute. He joined in partnership with the big financier Isaac Bronson, one of the founders of sound credit in public finance. As a result of the reflective determination of this close group to expand bank facility to construction of the American Empire, he borrowed heavily to finance the greatest canal construction project in history. The Erie Canal was an immense feat of ingenuity partly funded by the Bronson family bankers. In politics, Murray was a friend of the Democratic-Republicans of the Albany Regency. Their leading character, De Witt Clinton, had been involved in scandal. But the successor, Martin Van Buren, proved both clever and honest. In 1816 Murray joined the staff of Vice-President candidate Daniel Tompkins, the Governor. Murray's role was to act as bodyguard and protector of the V-P. Then one day on the Chesapeake half of President Tyler's cabinet was blown sky high. Murray's political ambitions ended there and then. Murray resolved to become a good business investor in land speculations and construction projects. He continued to do business with the Bronson sons. He became involved in rather dubious Rutherford Land Grab of 1834 in the Carolinas, but was not convicted. He was also in a partnership that invested extensively in the 'Ohio Country' as far west as Chicago and Kalamazoo. In later life Murray made extensive business trips to France and England. He was particularly pleased with Paris where his daughter married the American Impressionist painter, William Dana. Murray went on tour to Scotland and visited the high society circles of London. His public appearances attracted fees. Murray deplored the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, the duration of which he spent in New York City. Personal life In 1814, he married Maria Bronson (1793–1851), the eldest surviving daughter of Isaac Bronson (1760–1838), founder of New York Assurance Company and Bridgeport Bank at Park Place in New York City, and sister of Oliver Bronson. In 1828, Bronson was the richest man in New York. Murray was at the height of polite New York society and purchased a house at the fashionable Manhattan address of Washington Square Park. Together, they were the parents of eight children, including: * Maria Murray (1815–1884), who married at Greenfield Hill, Connecticut, in 1846. * Bronson Murray (1816–1911), who married Ann Eliza Peyton (b. 1821) in 1848. * John Boyles Murray (1818–1889), who married Sarah Elizabeth Craft (1823–1869) in 1843. After her death, he married Felicia May Leiss, the daughter of Dr. Frederic Leiss. * Caroline Murray (1820–1889), who died unmarried. * Agnes Augusta Murray (1827–1878) * Washington Murray (1828–1867), a Yale and Harvard Law School graduate who married Eliza Bradlee Winchester Dana (b. 1835), sister of William Dana in 1856. * Anna Bronson Murray (1831–1915), who married William Parsons Winchester Dana (1833–1927) in 1855. Murray died in 1866 at 4 Washington Place, New York City. His family was later related to William Cutting (of Gangs of New York fame).

In medieval times the castle formed part of the defences of the town of Luzech due to its dominance of the Lot River. In the 15th century the chateau belonged to the Couderc family, who were notaries in Luzech, and in the 16th century the Courtois family held the lordship. With his marriage to Hélène de Courtois in 1640, Gerard Lefranc became lord of the domain. He was the first hereditary president of the Cours des Aides in nearby Cahors. His grandson, Jacques Lefrance, was president when the court was moved to Montauban in 1709, when he bought a property at Pompignan. Jacques' eldest son, the noted French poet Jean-Jacques Lefranc, Marquis de Pompignan spent the first half of his life at Cayx and received some of the inspiration for his garden at the Chateau de Pompignan from the siting and views (though not the architecture, by then outmoded) of Cayx. Jacques' second son, Jean-Georges, bishop of Vienne and also an Enlightenment figure was raised there as well.Article (in French) on Lefranc at The sale of Cayx may have funded some of the building works at Pompignan, which itself was sold by Jean-Jacques' grandson in 1833.See Cranga , p 192 The château was first fortified during the fourteenth century. Since then it has been rebuilt and renovated several times. The Lefrancs built the extensive wine cellars under the château. The phylloxera infestation devastated the vineyards during the late nineteenth century, and the owners emigrated to Indo-China. They did not return to Europe until 1955. In 1967 the family's heir, Henri Marie Jean André de Laborde de Monpezat, married Princess Margrethe, then heiress presumptive to the Danish throne, becoming Prince Consort of Denmark after she succeeded to Denmark's throne. The royal couple purchased the château and the estate in 1974. Since then they have renovated it extensively. According to the official website of the Danish monarchy, the residence has become a \\"relaxed setting for reunions of the entire Danish Royal Family and their French relatives\\". It has been the setting for holiday photocalls for the Danish Royal Family, including for Prince Henrik's 80th birthday. The residence is not open to the public.

It is the first systematic, large scale mapping in Belgium and Western Europe. There are three original versions of the map. The Royal Library of Belgium, the Austrian National Library and National Library of the Netherlands each have one. History The topographic survey was performed on a territory corresponding to today's Belgium and Luxembourg as well as some territories now belonging to Germany and the Netherlands. The map was published at the original scale of 1/11.520 and includes 275 sheets. Importance Napoleon Bonaparte consulted the maps and subsequently used his topographical knowledge in his military campaigns. The Ferraris maps reflect the detailed state of the Southern Netherlands just before the start of the Industrial Revolution and the end of the Ancien Régime, when the landscape was still similar to that of the Middle Ages. Looking at the maps today, it is obvious how much the areas have changed over time as people began to have a bigger impact on the environment. Environmental organisations like to use the maps to point out the original state of an area. The maps can also help identify archaeological finds. This works both ways: archaeologists regularly use the maps to search for remains of buildings.

Life Hughes was born on 7 February 1877 in Tywyn, Merionethshire, Wales. As a result of a childhood accident, he was blind in one eye and his other eye was damaged; he compensated by developing his memory and hearing. After studying at Bala grammar school, he obtained a first-class degree in history from the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth in 1898. He then obtained a second- class honours degree in modern history from Jesus College, Oxford in 1902. He taught history in the boys' school in Llanelli, south Wales before his appointment as lecturer in history at University College, Cardiff, acting as professor during the illness of the incumbent. He lectured on Welsh history for the Workers' Educational Association in Glamorgan at a time when there was no extramural department at the university. He was regarded as a \\"gifted story-teller\\" and did much to popularise the study of Welsh history. He moved to the University College, Swansea when it was founded in 1920 after being persuaded to do so by the principal, Franklin Sibly, who wanted a Welshman who understood what the new college would need to do in an industrial area. Hughes, who was the only Arts lecturer for a time, did much to bring the college to the public's attention. He raised funds by lecturing on Welsh history in the area and donating the proceeds to set up the library of the college. He was appointed the first professor of history in 1926, but continued to lecture (in both Welsh and English) outside the university to classes and societies. He required every student in his department to study some Welsh history, but he had Glyn Roberts (later to be Professor of Welsh History at University College, Bangor) to teach these classes, since Roberts had research qualifications that Hughes could not obtain with his worsening eyesight. Hughes taught the constitutional history of England in the Middle Ages and also Europe after the fall of Rome. He retired in 1944, and died on 23 December 1953. Outside the university, he was chairman of the Swansea Drama Company (acting and producing as well), and of the Swansea Orpheus Musical Society. He was a council member and drama adjudicator of the National Eisteddfod, served on committees of the University of Wales and was a governor of the National Library of Wales.

Retrieved May 20, 2014. On the morning of Ascension day, the chapter, having heard many examinations and confessions read, proceeded to the election of the criminal who was to be pardoned; and, the choice being made, his name was transmitted in writing to the parliament, which assembled on that day at the palace. The parliament then walked in procession to the great chamber, where the prisoner was brought before them in irons, and placed on a stool; he was informed that the choice had fallen upon him, and that he was entitled to the privilege of St. Romain. After these preliminaries, he was delivered into the hands of the chaplain, who, accompanied by fifty armed men, conveyed him to a chamber, where the chains were taken from his legs and bound about his arms; and in this condition he was conducted to a place named the Old Tower, where he awaited the coming of the procession. After some little time had elapsed, the procession set out from the cathedral; two of the canons bore the shrine in which the relics of St. Romain were presumed to be preserved. When they had arrived at the Old Tower, the shrine was placed in the chapel, opposite to the criminal, who appeared kneeling, with the chains on his arms. Then one of the canons, having made him repeat the confession, said the prayers usual at the time of giving absolution; after which service, the prisoner kneeling still, lifted up the shrine three times, amid the acclamations of the people assembled to behold the ceremony. The procession then returned to the cathedral, followed by the criminal, wearing a chaplet of flowers on his head, and carrying the shrine of the saint. After mass had been performed, he had a very serious exhortation addressed to him by a monk; and, lastly, he was conducted to an apartment near the cathedral, and was supplied with refreshments and a bed for that night. In the morning he was dismissed. This privilege was justified by the legend of the Gargouille, a fearsome dragon, and how St. Romain defeated him with the help of a prisoner. It was abolished in a famous night of the French Revolution.

It went through four variants coded SA to SD. In October 1935 the Speed 20 was supplemented by a 3½-litre car initially sold alongside their Speed 20 SD and named 3½-litre SA. After their Speed 20 was dropped from their catalogue the 3½-litre car was given a shorter wheelbase and named Speed 25 SB. Speed 20 SA {The engine for the Speed 20 was a heavily modified version of the one used in the preceding Silver Eagle cars, producing . Triple HV4 type SU carburettors were fitted. As before the engine and clutch unit sat on flexible conical rubber mountings in a system used by Alvis from 1925. The chassis was new and lowered by making it a \\"double drop\\" type where the side rails go over the front and rear axles. A centralised lubrication system was fitted allowing oil to be provided to moving suspension parts through a maze of pipework. Both front and rear suspension used half-elliptic leaf springs and the self-servo brakes, with drums, were mechanically operated. The four-speed manual gearbox was mounted in-unit with the engine. 1932 Sports tourer 1933 Sports tourer } The car could be fitted with a variety of coachwork. Standard bodies were a four- door sports saloon from coachbuilders Charlesworth, a four-seater sports coupé or four-door tourer by Cross & Ellis, but some cars were supplied in chassis form and carried bodies by coachbuilders such as Vanden Plas. Approximately 400 of the SA cars were made. Speed 20 SB The SB launched at the October 1933 London Motor Show had a new cruciform braced chassis, slightly longer at , with independent front suspension using a single transverse leaf spring with a long solid anchorage in the centre.Specifications, Latest British Products, Models For 1935, Cars and Commercial Vehicles. The Times, Tuesday, 2 Apr 1935; pg. 63; Issue 47028. Steering was improved using new designs employed for racing Alvis cars since 1925. Road shocks were not transmitted from one wheel to the other nor did they affect the steering wheel and the gyroscopic effect was eliminated. Rear springs damped by Hartford Telecontrol dampers are long and underslung. The engine remained the same but the new all-silent gearbox, the first of its type, gained synchromesh on bottom gear and was mounted separately from the engine. A built-in jacking system was fitted as standard. As with the SA, a wide range of bodies were fitted to the cars. Large Lucas P100 headlamps became standard, adding to the sporting appearance of the car. {Speed 20 standard 4-door sports saloon by Charlesworth 1934 Speed 20 with sporting two-seat body } =Road test= The Times motoring correspondent tested and after describing its technical features in detail reviewed the car. Salient comments have been summarised as follows. The four-seater saloon was described as \\"distinctly fast in acceleration and speed\\" with a comfortable body such that a passer-by looks twice at it. A third person could be squeezed into the back seat. The four windows in the four doors allowed a good view all round. It was noted that each front wheel was independently steered and sprung in the manner introduced on the Alvis Crested Eagle and used on Alvis's racing cars since 1925, the aim being to provide good directional stability, road- holding and comfort.The Times, Tuesday, 3 April 1934; pg. 3; Issue 46718. The steering and suspension was a star feature, the steering action exceptionally steady and light. The car does not heel or roll and there is little wheel bounce. The best speeds on second and third gears were 48 and 68 mph, 90 mph should be possible in top. Providing on the road such rapid acceleration and high rates the engine ran fairly quietly and with smoothness yet displaying exuberant spirits. The action of clutch and new gear change was pleasing. {1934 Speed 20 SC fixed head coupé by Vanden Plas 1935 Speed 20 SC sports saloon by Mayfair } Speed 20 SC For 1935 the engine grew to 2762 cc by increasing the stroke to 110 mm and the range designation became SC. Modifications were also made to the complex steering gear, and the front damping was improved. Twin electric fuel pumps were provided. At the rear the chassis was stiffened by having side members above and below the axle. {Speed 20 SC instrument panel Speed 20 SC } Speed 20 SD {The final SD version for 1936 was similar to the SC but had a larger fuel tank and slightly wider bodywork.

It became a seat of a Catholic parish as it was mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment among Catholic parishes of Oświęcim deaconry of the Diocese of Kraków as Bestwina. Politically it belonged initially to the Duchy of Opole and Racibórz and the Castellany of Oświęcim, which was in 1315 formed in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland into the Duchy of Oświęcim, ruled by a local branch of Silesian Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia. In 1457 Jan IV of Oświęcim agreed to sell the duchy to the Polish Crown, and in the accompanying document issued on 21 February the village was mentioned as Bestwina. The territory of the Duchy of Oświęcim was eventually incorporated into Poland in 1564 and formed Silesian County of Kraków Voivodeship. Upon the First Partition of Poland in 1772 it became part of the Austrian Kingdom of Galicia. After World War I and fall of Austria- Hungary it became part of Poland.

It is considered a pest species to agricultural crops, however, due to its inland habitat, is found to be less damaging to agricultural areas than other species of the genus.  Taxonomy  Francis Walker first described Heliothis punctifera in 1857. The lesser budworm is an Australian species of the genus Heliothis from the family Noctuidae. Heliothine moths are considered pests, however not all species are. The lesser budworm can be confused with the native budworm (Helicoverpa punctigera) and the cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera), Australia's top two pest species, who are both more prevalent in agricultural areas and considered more detrimental to crops than the lesser budworm.  Description  The lesser budworm caterpillar has stripes of dark green to light brown that run the length of its body and are separated by thin white lines. There is a thick pale stripe on each side of its body. The light coloured hairs behind its head are what distinguish it most from other similar species. The adult lesser budworm has a bold defined pattern on its brown to orange forewings. Its hindwings are dark and fade to the base which is a lighter colour. The underside of each forewing has a large dark comma-shape. In moth form it has a wingspan is about 30 mm.Dorsal view = Similar species = The lesser budworm looks very similar to the native budworm and the cotton bollworm, particularly in the larval stage where the species are difficult to differentiate. The following can be used to identify differences between H. punctifera and the other similar species:Ventral view  Larval stage:  Helicoverpa punctigera – (differences: ranges in colour from light brown, to green, to black and has black hairs around the collar). Helicoverpa armigera – (differences: black/brown hair on body).  Moth stage:  Helicoverpa punctigera – (differences: lighter and slightly reddish in comparison with a less distinctive wing pattern). Helicoverpa armigera – (differences: forewing has distinctive kidney-shaped marking in the centre, hind-wing has dark bands and a lighter patch in the centre). Adult moth  Distribution  It is found primarily in arid inland desert regions, however, it is not restricted to this environment and is found across all states of Australia.  Characteristics and migration  Noctuid moths tend to travel at night at high altitudes, capable of flying hundreds of kilometres. Because the lesser budworm occurs in arid inland areas, generally far from agricultural areas, there is little monitoring data on their migrations compared to the more popular pest species of heliothine moth. Lesser budworm caterpillars are considered extremely mobile, moving across the desert sands between host plants in their quest to consume many flower heads to guarantee their development. The desert plants that comprise most of their diet bloom in the winter months in a seasonal event after rains in the inland regions.  Reproduction and lifecycle  The adult life of a heliothine moth is about 10 days. In this time, the female moth can lay substantial amount of eggs in host plants; up to 1000. Successful breeding of the lesser budworm and other heliothine moths, depends on significant rainfall in late autumn and early winter which encourages the growth of desert flowers. The variability of rainfall across arid inland Australia ensures some growth of host plants is interspersed across the country, however the amounts and locations are variable. The eggs of heliothine moths tend to hatch within 3–10 days, dependent on how warm the temperature is. Eggs and pupae have the capacity to enter a diapause phase of overwintering if temperatures are too low for metamorphosis. By late winter and early spring, incoming warmer and drier weather usually signals the senescence of the seasons individuals and brings an influx of the lesser budworm in its moth stage. Favourable wind patterns and warm nights extend their migration.  Diet  Polycalymma stuartii The Asteraceae are their desert flowers of choice, which tend to bloom in the winter months in large groups. Lesser budworms have been observed feeding predominantly on the species of annual yellow top, Senecio gregorii (F. Muell) and the poached egg daisy, Polycalymma stuartii (F. Muell & Sond.) and appear to prefer the annual yellow top. Senecio gregorii A study on the host location behaviour of the lesser budworm found that the distribution of caterpillars on plants is not just dependent on the adults choice for the oviposition of larvae. The caterpillars were observed moving between plants. They were also seen feeding on both the flowering heads and the vegetative tissue of the plants. The study suggests that the purpose of including the vegetative tissue in their diet is to cope with host plant overcrowding. The end of the blooming season exhibits more movement as competition for host plants is highest.  Agricultural impacts  Heliothine moths are considered particularly devastating pests to agricultural areas. Due to their polyphagous eating habits, they can move between crop species and as their numbers intensify, can have huge impacts. The most damaging species identified is the cotton bollworm. The lesser budworm can be damaging to crops, however, because they primarily occur in outback areas of Australia, they are only sometimes found in agricultural areas. The ideal conditions required for the lesser budworm to cause significant damage to crops are substantial rains in summer that encourage growth in vegetation, teamed with significant winds that permit flight over long distances to reach agricultural areas. The last reported large-scale occurrence of lesser budworm damage to crops was in 2005. There are reports of damage to wheat crops in Deniliquin where white heads appeared similar to crown rot. The larvae seemed to have chewed through plants to eat the inside of the stems which affects nutrient flow to the heads of the wheat plants. The moths can occur in huge numbers when migrating within the country. In November 2005, this species caused a panic at Murray Downs Golf Club near Swan Hill, when swarms of them invaded the course and clubhouse. The walls, ceiling and floor of the clubhouse were covered with resting moths. It is considered a pest on alfalfa, Mexican cotton and wheat.

She is the author of Once was Bombay, Aruna's Story, Bitter Chocolate: Child Sexual Abuse in India (which won the National Award), and Deaf Heaven. Her fifth book is called Politics of the Womb  The Perils of Ivf, Surrogacy & Modified Babies. Early life and education Virani was born in Mumbai, India, 30 January 1959, to Gujarati Muslim parents. Her father owned a shop, and her mother was a teacher. She attended school in Mumbai, Pune and Mussoorie. She went to the US to study for a Masters in Journalism on the Aga Khan Foundation scholarship. She did an internship at The Sunday Times, where she reported extensively on the race riots in Britain. Career She started working as a typist at the age of 18. When she returned to India after her scholarship, she worked as a reporter and went on to become India's first woman editor of an evening paper. She moved from daily journalism when she published her first book. Virani is the author of five books. Aruna's Story is about the rape of a nurse that left her in a coma. The book forms part of a 52-minute documentary, produced by the PSBT, titled 'Passive Euthanasia: Kahaani Karuna Ki'.Theatre director Arvind Gaur scripted and directed it as solo play 'Aruna's Story'. Solo act performed by Lushin Dubey Bitter Chocolate is about child sexual abuse in India. A Solo play based on this book was scripted-directed by Arvind Gaur and performed by Lushin Dubey. Once Was Bombay is a sociology book. Deaf Heaven, her first work of fiction, experiments with form and style to warn off the danger of the tipping over of a modern country into neo-fascism. In Politics Of The Womb – The Perils Of Ivf, Surrogacy & Modified Babies (2016), Virani criticises IVF and other forms of assisted reproduction when used on women in aggressively repetitive cycles and calls for a worldwide ban on commercial surrogacy and other forms of third-party assisted reproduction Aruna Shanbaug case In 2009, Pinki Virani filed a petition in Supreme Court of India on behalf of Aruna Shanbaug, a nurse working at the KEM Hospital in Mumbai on 27 November 1973 when she was sexually assaulted by a sweeper. During the attack, Shanbaug was strangled with a chain, and the deprivation of oxygen left her in a vegetative state. She was treated at KEM following the incident and was kept alive by a feeding tube for 48 years, until her death of pneumonia in 2015. In Virani's 2009 petition, she argued that the \\"continued existence of Aruna is in violation of her right to live in dignity\\". The Supreme Court made its decision on 7 March 2011. It rejected the plea to discontinue Aruna's life support but issued a set of broad guidelines legalising passive euthanasia in India. The Supreme Court also refused to recognise Virani as the \\"next friend\\" of Shanbaug, a description Virani had used to file the petition.

Sir James Pender, 1st Baronet (28 September 1841 – 20 May 1921) was a British businessman, yachtsman and Conservative Party politician. He sat in the House of Commons from 1895 to 1900. Early life Pender was the eldest son from Sir John Pender's first marriage to Marion Cairn. His father was the founder of the Eastern Telegraph Company, which later became Cable & Wireless. His younger half-brother was Sir John Denison-Pender, father of John Denison-Pender, 1st Baron Pender.  Career  He was a Director of Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company 'Telcon' taken over decades later by British Insulated Callender's Cables, Director Globe Telegraph Trust, Director Direct United States Cable Company Ltd, Director Eastman Kodak New Jersey, and the Chairman of Eastman Kodak (UK) from 1898 until 1913. He unsuccessfully contested Northamptonshire Mid at the 1892 general election. He was elected at the 1895 general election also sat as Member of Parliament for Mid Northamptonshire, and held the seat until his defeat at the 1900 general election. In 1897 he was made a baronet, of Thornby Hall in the County of Northampton. In 1902 Pender won the King's Cup at the Royal Yacht Squadron regatta at Cowes with his yawl Brynhild (Charles E. Nicholson design, 1899), beating the Kaiser Wilhelm's schooner Meteor III (Archibald Cary Smith design, 1902); the prize was presented to him by Albert Edward, Prince of Wales. It was rumoured at the time that the Prince gave up yacht racing in favour of horse racing (at which he was very successful) as his Yacht Britannia regularly lost to the Kaiser's yawl Meteor II (George Lennox Watson design, 1896). James Pender Bt was the Rear Commodore of Royal Thames Yacht Club in 1904, and during that year he won the Kaiserlicher Yacht Club regatta with Brynhild at the Kieler Yacht-Club and was presented with the prize by the Kaiser, who had anonymously (as he always used to at the Kiel Yacht Club) donated that prize to the Kiel Yacht Club in the name of 'A friend of Sailing'. In 1908, Pender's new Camper & Nicholsons 23mR Brynhild II defeated the Sir Thomas Lipton's Shamrock and Myles Burton Kennedy's White Heather II (both Fife designs) in the Cowes regatta and the King's Cup. James Pender's other yachts Lamorna and Florinda (later rechristened Gosport Mistake and Siesta) were all built and designed by Camper & Nicholsons. Pender married Mary Rose Gregge-Hopwood of Hopwood Hall. They lived at Donhead House, Donhead St Andrew, Wiltshire. Sir James Pender is buried with his wife Mary Rose at St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew, Wiltshire.

It has evolved steadily since the organization's founding in 2001, with the latest addition being the Rectors' Forum (2006). The Council The basic element in the structure is the annual UArctic Council, which consists of representatives from all member institutions. It holds powers roughly corresponding to the parliament of a parliamentary democracy. The Council gives strategic guidance on academic priorities, is a forum for cooperation, and has the authority and primary responsibility for the following items. * Initiating and overseeing program development and delivery * Prioritizing academic programs within the approved program structure * Representing UArctic's members in its overall governance. * Changing the Governance Structure, which is the \\"constitution\\" of UArctic. * Forming standing committees on different issues. * Electing the Chair of the Council. * Electing the Board of Governors, where the Chair is an ex officio member. Toyon Between Council meetings, the executive committee Toyon deals with relevant issues. Toyon consists of the Chair, the Vice- secretary and the Chairs of all standing committees. All these positions are elected by the Council. The Board of Governors The \\"government\\" of UArctic is the Board of Governors, which consists of up to 11 individuals elected by the Council to serve in their personal capacities and act on behalf of UArctic. According to the statutes of the University of the Arctic, one of these is to represent the students. At the Board meetings, the President and leader of the International Secretariat also participate. The Board works with the Council and Administration on relevant issues, and may delegate specific tasks on the understanding that the Board maintains ultimate control over and responsibility for these functions. The Board has the authority and primary responsibility for the following items: * Strategic planning and setting institutional priorities. * Organizational development and institutional accountability. * Fundraising, finances, and budgeting (including personnel) * Public and external relations. * Electing the President of the University of the Arctic for a three-year (renewable) term. The President The President of UArctic is the organization's chief executive officer and is responsible for overall administration and the development and delivery of its programs. S/he is accountable to the Board for the overall management of the University and elected by the Council. The President participates ex officio in meetings of the Council, Toyon and the Board, and works closely with these bodies to ensure that programmatic activities are initiated and implemented in a timely manner. The President may form such committees or other subsidiary bodies as s/he deems necessary to carry out the programmatic activities of the University. The International Secretariat The Secretariat has the primary responsibility for coordinating internal and external information, particularly the production of the monthly UArctic newsletter, Shared Voices, and maintaining the website and news services. The Secretariat provides support for UArctic’s Council, Board of Governors, management, and the Director of UArctic. It is located at the University of Lapland in Rovaniemi, Finland. Pomot and Ofelas The Rectors' Forum The Rectors' Forum brings together university and college Presidents, Rectors, Provosts, Chancellors as well as Vice-Presidents around specific themes. The Forum is reserved for institutional leadership and is not intended as an institutional representative forum; the Council of UArctic serves that function. Still, it serves the important function of letting member institutions' top leaders meet to debate the activity of the organization. In UArctic's history two Rectors' Forums have been held, in 2006 and 2008. The latter meeting coincided with the meeting of the Parliamentarians of the Arctic, and was held in Rovaniemi, Finland.

Acts generally take the form of legal instruments of writing that have probative value and executory force. They are usually accepted as self-authenticating demonstrative evidence in court proceedings, though with the precarious status of notaries public and their acts under common law, this is not always so. Common types of acts are legislative, judicial, and notarial acts. Legislative acts Legislative acts (fully, acts of statute), or more commonly statutes, are the cornerstone of statutory and regulatory law. They may include in a monarchical system any royal edict, proclamation, or decree setting forth or establishing law as it affects all citizens. In parliamentary or congressional systems, acts passed by a legislature are known as acts of Parliament or acts of Congress. Notarial acts A notarial act (or notarial instrument or notarial writing) is any written narration of facts (recitals) drawn up by a notary public or civil-law notary authenticated by his signature and official seal and detailing a procedure which has been transacted by or before him in his official capacity. A notarial act is the only lawful means of proving those facts of which it is the recognized record, whereas on other matters it is usually inadmissible, because, being beyond the powers entrusted to the notary by law, it is non-official. In most common-law countries, multiple-page acts are bound together using a sewn or knotted ribbon (referred to as silk), the ends of which are secured by a wafer impressed with the notary's seal. This is called annexing or annexure. =Act in public form= The first category is known as an \\"act in public form\\" (Fr acte en minute, Du minuutakte, It atto conservato, Ger urschriftliche Urkunde, Sp acta protocolar), and is the preserve of notaries-at-law. Public form acts may take the form of a record of some activity which is intended or required to have evidentiary status, legal or administrative force or effect, or commercial effect. Acts in this form remain the cornerstone of civil-law notarial practice according to which they are composed as single narrative instruments written in the first person perspective of the notary. Public-form acts include all contracts and governing instruments (e.g. conveyance, will, trust, power of attorney, gift). Traditionally, in civil-law countries, the preliminary drafts, called \\"minutes\\" (formerly protocols; Fr minute, Du minuut, It minuta, Ger Urschrift, Sp escritura matriz), are jotted in legal shorthand and record only the particulars. Their date, appearer, venue, and subject are logged in a notarial register, and the minutes are retained and kept in the notary's protocol (archive) while an engrossment (Fr/Du grosse, It spedizione in forma esecutiva, Ger Ausfertigung, Sp primer testimonio), a fully extended form in long hand under seal and signature, is handed to the appearer. The minutes are used thereafter as a master copy from which exemplifications (Fr expédition, It spedizione, Sp ', copia simple, Du authentiek afschrift, uitgifte, Ger beglaubigte Abschrift), i.e. engrossed fair copies, may be made. In common-law countries, notaries prepare multiple duplicate originals fully executed and sealed, as a copy would not be admissible in court. One is archived as a file copy in the notary's protocol. =Act in private form= The second category is known as an \\"act in private form\\" (Fr acte en brevet, Du ', akte in originali, It atto rilasciato in originale, Ger Urkunde im Original, Sp acta extraprotocolar), best represented by the notarial certificate (or \\"docquet\\" in Scotland). This is generally a writing that certifies the due execution in the notary's presence of a deed, contract or other writing or verifies some fact or thing of which the notary has certain knowledge. Notarial certificates are endorsed on or appended to a pre-existing document and attest to its due execution, genuine nature and validity, or legal status and effects. As a safety precaution, the certificate may also contain information such as the number of pages, a description of the document, its title, and any other distinguishing features in order to prevent pages from being added or removed. If affixed, short form certificates may also be embossed with a seal half on the certificate and half on the rest of the page. Notarial certificates come in full forms or short forms. A full form includes preamble information like the date, venue, appearer's appearance, proof of identification, and so forth, as well as the principal attestation. A short form usually only includes the venue, date, and \\"attestation clause\\". Both are then ended with a \\"testimonium clause\\".

Burma was once Asia's largest exporter of rice, and rice remains the country's most crucial agricultural commodity. Other main crops include pulses, beans, sesame, groundnuts, sugarcane, lumber, and fish. Moreover, livestock are raised as both a source of food and labour. Agricultural products Rice planting in Burma, 2006 =Crops= * Rice * Corn * Pulses * Peas * Onions * Groundnuts * Niger seeds * Sesame * Spices - coriander, ginger, turmeric, red chili * Sugarcane * Lumber – see Forestry (below) Methods An example of Slash-and-burn farming methods, seen here in use in Northwestern Zambia A rice paddy in the Chin State, Burma Historically and at present, the primary method for rendering arable land is the slash-and-burn method (also known as \\"shifting cultivation\\" or \\"swiddening\\"). This involves setting fire to areas of primary forest or secondary forest to create fields where crops can be cultivated. After these fields are used for a time and the nutrients in the soil are used up, the land is abandoned and allowed to grow freely. Growth begins in the one to three years following the land's abandonment, and within 10 to 20 years it is once again able to hold an established secondary forest. Sometimes, this arable land is converted into rice paddies, a common agricultural technique in southern and eastern Asia. In Burma, the paddies are flooded only occasionally by rivers, while a majority of the time farmers rely on the monsoon season for the necessary water. The paddies have an \\"impermeable subsoil\\", on top of which is a saturated layer of mud, and lastly around 4–6 inches of water. =Livestock= Farmers in Burma raise livestock for both food and labour purposes. This includes cattle, water buffalo, goats, sheep, oxen, chickens, and pigs. Oxen and water buffalo are used as draft animals throughout the country, while most cattle are raised in the dryer northern regions. Goats are kept by farmers in pasture for their milk. Farmers in Burma were affected by the outbreak of the H5N1 bird flu strand in Asia. Initially, the Mandalay and Sagaing regions of Burma were affected, and this resulted in the culling of several thousand chickens, quails and their eggs. However, as of 2006, the country's livestock officials announced a plan to fund the restocking of birds and feed for the effected poultry farms. =Fishing= Fishing makes up a fair portion of Burma's food production. Fishing occurs in both salt and freshwater, and it is estimated that there are up to 300 species in the Burmese fresh waters. Of these, there are several endemic species, including the Indostromus paradoxus of the Indawgyi Lake in Northern Burma. Moreover, dried and salted fish is an integral part of the country's cuisine, and the primary source of protein in the Burmese diet. In Burma, there are several types of fisheries, including coastal or inshore fisheries, and offshore or deep-sea fisheries. A majority of these fish are harvested by commercial means, which includes the use of trawling nets, purse seins, driftnet and gillnet. A minority still use traditional techniques, such as hook-and-line, cast net, bag net, trammel gill net, lift net, and traps. In 2003, trawling accounted for 40% of fish caught. In the 1980s, the Burmese government sought to encourage deep-sea fishing, and since then there has been a steady increase in the yearly catches. In 1989, Thai companies were given permission to fish in the coastal waters of Burma, using trawlers to harvest fish. =Forestry= Though Burma's neighbours, such as India, China, and Thailand, have depleted most of their forests, and despite slash-and-burn techniques, Burma is still considered to be relatively rich in forests and the resources they provide. It is considered by some to be \\"the last frontier of biodiversity in Asia.\\" In Burma, teak, acadia, bamboo, and ironwood are raised, harvested, and exported. The country is the leading supplier of teak in the international market, and is a substantial supplier of bamboo. Economic significance Agriculture and the processing of agricultural products provides a majority of the employment and income in Burma, producing around 60% of the national GDP and employing as many as 65% of the population. While Burma yields more than enough food to feed its entire population, many still go hungry for lack of purchasing power. As of 2007, Burma's main countries of export were Thailand (receiving 44%), India (14.5%), China (7%), and Japan (6%). By 2010, China had become a key export partner, receiving 97% of Burmese-produced corn and 9% of beans and pulses. These figures came as a result of increasing Chinese demand and an increasingly healthy trading relationship. Since 2001, total agricultural exports have been down: in 2001–2002 Burma exported 939,000 tons of rice and 1,035,000 tons of pulses, whereas in 2010–2011 536,000 tons of rice and 920,000 tons of pulses were exported. This could be the result of increased demand for these products within the country, as opposed to a response to decreased production. The decrease in emphasis on exporting agricultural goods could reflect a response to the fluctuating value of the Burmese kyat as it relates to other nations' currencies. Instead, attention was directed towards creating \\"non-traded services,\\" like construction, or to the production of goods with a high \\"price to cost ratio,\\" like gems, jade and natural gas. Environmental impact At present, there is debate over the environmental impact of the varied farming methods used in Burma. Some credit slash-and-burn farming methods with \\"destroying the forests of the country, causing soil erosion and depletion of fertility,\\" considering it to be reckless deforestation. Recently, the Burmese Government has increased its attempted regulation of farming practices, and this includes banning slash-and-burn tactics in some villages. However, some consider forcing a change from slash- and-burn methods to the more commercial methods of \\"permanent\\" agriculture to be even worse for the environment. They assert that the slash-and-burn method completes part of a cycle of forestation wherein a new secondary forest is allowed to grow once the land has been cultivated. Thus, devoting an area completely to a particular crop disrupts this pattern and renders the land completely unusable after a period of time. Because farmers in Burma rely on the monsoon season as their primary water source, they are subject to the recent fluctuating weather patterns. For example, the Burmese rice crop was negatively affected by a record high rainfall during the prolonged 2011 monsoon season which resulted in a projected 10 percent drop in production.

It was one of the earliest – and for several years almost the only – radio programme in the country to broadcast pop music. For most of its history, it was presented by Brian Matthew.  Saturday Skiffle Club  The programme began after a suggestion by producer Jimmy Grant. He initially proposed a modest series called Skiffle Session, featuring two or three singers with a skiffle group. At first, BBC management was unsure that there should be a radio show specifically for teenagers, but auditions were held for musicians including Chas McDevitt, and a weekly programme was agreed. As Saturday Skiffle Club, it was first broadcast on 1 June 1957. It had a budget of £55 per week, and newsreader Brian Matthew as an announcer. Cliff Richard failed an audition for the programme and was not used, but early regular performers included McDevitt, the Vipers Skiffle Group, Johnny Duncan and his Bluegrass Boys, and George Melly and his Bubbling Over Four. The budget was increased on occasions when Lonnie Donegan, the top skiffle star of the time, performed. Although the experimental programme was successful, management was concerned about the high proportion of American songs performed, and also about the use of songs with religious themes.  The early years of Saturday Club  In October 1958, the programme was extended to two hours, from 10 am to 12 noon on Saturday mornings. The word \\"skiffle\\" was dropped from the title, its budget was increased, and a wider range of performers began to appear. These included Cliff Richard, Adam Faith, Chris Barber, Humphrey Lyttelton, Marty Wilde, Terry Dene, Vince Taylor, Johnny Kidd, Michael Holliday, Bert Weedon and Clinton Ford. Brian Matthew relaxed his style, and often started the show saying \\"Hello my ole mateys.\\" The show consisted mainly of pre-recorded \\"live\\" performances, because of \\"needle time\\" restrictions on the number of records that could be played by the BBC. Most programmes had four live acts and only contained around six record requests and three new releases. The theme music was \\"Saturday Jump\\", which was written by Jimmy Grant (under his pseudonym of Eddie James) and performed by Ted Heath. By August 1959 Saturday Club had a regular audience of five million listeners, including many children, as the programme immediately followed Children's Favourites. It soon began featuring performances from touring American artists including Eddie Cochran, Gene Vincent, Duane Eddy and Bobby Darin, after a Musicians' Union ban on performances by non-British musicians ended. Other American performers followed, including the Everly Brothers, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bo Diddley, Chris Montez and Tommy Roe. In 1960, an LP, Saturday Club, was issued, on the Parlophone label, featuring 13 performers including Tommy Bruce, Ricky Valance, Keith Kelly, Bert Weedon and the King Brothers.  The Beatles on Saturday Club  The fifth-anniversary show in October 1963 starred the Beatles, the Everly Brothers, Tommy Roe, Frank Ifield, Kathy Kirby, Clinton Ford, Roy Orbison, Joe Brown and his Bruvvers, Kenny Ball's Jazzmen and Arthur Greenslade's group with strings. The producer, Bernie Andrews, spent £483.12.6d on the performers. The Beatles received 50 guineas (£52 10s.). In all, the Beatles appeared on the programme ten times. They first appeared on 26 January 1963, two weeks after the release of \\"Please Please Me\\", when they performed \\"Some Other Guy\\", \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\", \\"Keep Your Hands Off My Baby\\" and \\"Beautiful Dreamer.\\" Their other appearances were on 16 March, 25 May, 29 June, 24 August, 5 October, and 21 December 1963; 15 February, 4 April, and, finally, 26 December 1964.  Later years  By 1965, Brian Matthew, who had also begun a Sunday morning programme, Easy Beat, had been replaced as host by Ray Orchard. The programme was effectively killed off by the advent of Radio 1 in 1967, although the BBC did keep it going for a year with Keith Skues as host. The first Radio 1 Saturday Club on 30 September 1967 featured the Bee Gees, and other editions included Dusty Springfield, Wayne Fontana, the Searchers, Jimi Hendrix, Manfred Mann, Small Faces, Cream and the Who. The show completed 500 editions on 4 May 1968, but was axed on 18 January 1969.  Recorded legacy  Sessions recorded for Saturday Club by Chas McDevitt, the Everly Brothers, Eddie Cochran, Gene Vincent, Johnny Kidd, Billy Fury, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull, Small Faces, Cream, Harry Nilsson and the Who have been released on CD.

It originated as the Provincialmuseum and was also previously known as the Museum Carolino-Augusteum. History =Origins= The Museum in 2010 The Salzburg Museum was founded in 1834, when a small collection of military memorabilia was made accessible to the public to formalize the memories of the Napoleonic wars. After the Revolution of 1848, the collection became the official town museum of Salzburg. =20th century= In 1924, the natural history objects of the museum were given to the Haus der Natur Salzburg. One year later, the folk culture collection opened a side- branch in the Monatsschlössl in the parks of Hellbrunn Palace. During World War II, the museum got three direct hits from bombs. Most of the collection had already been moved to mines that served as bunkers; however, the building was completely destroyed along with many objects too large to move. Several objects disappeared from their bunkers during the US occupation, including a collection of gold coins that had been kept in the salt mines of Hallein. A new building was opened as a provisory museum in 1967. A debate about the final and most worthy location for the headquarters of the Salzburg Museum lasted for decades. Side-branches of the Salzburg Museum were opened during this time: The Domgrabungsmuseum in 1974, the Spielzeugmuseum (Toy Museum) in 1978, and a newly developed Festungsmuseum (Fortress Museum) in 2000. By 1997, promoted by Landeshauptmann Franz Schausberger, local politicians had finally agreed on the Neue Residenz as a new venue for the Salzburg Museum. =21st century= The museum reopened in the Neue Residenz in 2005. In 2009, the museum received the European Museum of the Year Award.

In September 2014, Wales Online reported that a +100 year old packet of Army Club cigarettes exists. The pack is kept by Brian Alexander, which has kept it safe since his father passed it onto him after his grandfather, known as Arthur Maddox, gave it to him. \\"The cigarettes were brought home from World War One by my grandfather Arthur Maddox and he gave them to my father Fred Alexandar. My grandfather bet my father he would smoke them before the month was out because he was a chain smoker. But my father did not smoke them and so he passed them on to me and I still have them,\\" Brian said. An old Army Club advertising board Advertising Various posters were made to promote the brand, especially during the time of World War I. The posters were made in multiple languages, such as English and French. Advertising campaigns for this brand adopted the themes of nostalgia of wartime camaraderie and male culture. Army Club cigarettes were also promoted in newspapers, such as The Illustrated London News, as well as on railway carriages. Signs promoting this brand were also made. In the 1920s these cigarettes were sold in elaborate tins made of pressed copper. A set of landscape cards were also issued with every pack of Army Club cigarettes, along with a special camerascope to view the pictures with.

The village has a population of 968. Kruszyna is one of the oldest villages of the region. It was first mentioned in 1337, as the seat of a Roman Catholic parish, with its own church. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the village belonged to the noble Koniecpolski family. In the early 17th century, it was property of Aleksandra Koniecpolska and her husband Kasper Doenhoff, a courtier of King Zygmunt III Waza, and Voivode of Dorpat Voivodeship. After annexation of northern Livonia into the Swedish Empire (1620s), Doenhoff left his native province and settled in Kruszyna. He was one of favourite courtiers of the king, who named him Voivode of Sieradz Voivodeship and Starosta of both Wielun and Radomsko. In 1630, Kasper Doenhoff commissioned Italian architect Tomasz Poncino to build a Renaissance palace, in which in 1633, the wedding of Denhoff’s daughter took place. Furthermore, in February 1670, wedding reception of Michal Korybut Wisniowiecki and his wife Eleanor of Austria, Queen of Poland took place at the Kruszyna Palace. In the 19th century, the complex was remodelled, and after World War Two, the palace for a while housed an orphanage. By 1980, it was abandoned and neglected, together with adjacent park.

Upon the release, Ritu received generally positive reviews but mild response in theatres. Nowrunning.com sees Ritu as a sensitive, melancholic portrayal of tumultuous emotions that ravage three young minds basking on the pinnacle of success. \\"It is an engrossing, intricate slice-of-life that deftly captures the nuances of growing up together and finally growing apart.\\" Rediff and Indiaglitz reviewers termed it as a worthwhile experiment and said that it represents the changing face of Malayalam cinema. The acting skills of the three lead actors have been applauded: the newcomers did their part quite convincingly. Indiaglitz review said \\"It's high time for Mollywood film goers to change and settle down from the regular potboilers and applaud films like Ritu which has its heart exactly at the right place\\". Rediff said \\"Ritu is a worthwhile experiment by seasoned director Shyamaprasad with a predominantly new team\\". The Telugu version of Ritu, titled New, was released under two banners: Bhargava Pictures and Innostorm entertainment.

Because the ritual lasts nine nights, it is known as Barashnûm nû shaba or \\"Barashnûm of the nine nights\\".Darmesteter, Pg 119 Also see details on the Bareshnum ceremony by a Zoroastrian senior Priest and scholar Dr Ervad Ramiyar Karanjia  Etymology  Barashnûm is a Zend word meaning \\"top of the head\\".Darmesteter, Pg 133 The whole ritual is named \\"Barashnûm\\" because purification starts from the head of the person, which is the first part in his body which is purified.  Purpose  In pre-Islamic times, Barashnûm was used to purify men and women who had been defiled by contact with dead matter and by priests before undergoing training for priesthood and certain ceremonies. However, now the Bareshnum ceremony is only undertaken by priests before their Navar and Martab training ceremonies for initiation into priesthood and before the Vendidad Nirangdin Yasna ceremonies and the one to purify men or women coming in contact with dead is discontinued (refer ramiyarkaranjia.com - What is the Bareshnum )  The ritual  Fargard 9 of the Vendidad prescribes the requirements for the Barashnûm ritual. It prescribes that a series of six holes two feet deep if it was summer season and four feet deep if it was winter season be dug at a distance of three feet from each other and a series of three holes at a distance of nine feet from the other six.Darmesteter, Pg 121 The hole at the most extreme corner should be situated at a distance of at least thirty paces from the holy fire or consecrated barsom and three paces from \\"clean\\" Zoroastrians.Darmesteter, Pg 120 The holes should lie in a north-south direction and the first six are to be filled with gōmēz while the other three are to be filled with water. Holes 4-6 should be separated from holes 7-9 through a ring of 3 furrows arranged concentrically which act as a protective barrier.Darmesteter, Pg 122 Similarly, holes 4-9 were to be separated from holes 1-3 by a barrier of 3 furrows. This arrangement is called the Barashnûm-gâh and is to be separated from cleaner pastures by an outer enclosure comprising a series of three furrows. The impure person should walk to each of the holes containing gomez in turn while reciting Yasna 49 of the Avesta while the Zoroastrian priest recites the same from outside the furrow surrounding the hole and sprinkles gomez upon the impure person on completion of each recitation.Darmesteter, Pg 123 - 125 The priest purifies the brows, the back of the skull, jaws, ears, the shoulders, arm-pits, chest, back, nipples, ribs, hips, genitals, thighs, knees, legs, ankles, feet and toes of the subject by sprinkling a few drops of gomez upon them. Once the purification is complete, the subject recites the Ahunwar, Kem-na-Mazda, Kem verethrem ja and other principal prayers of the Zoroastrians.Darmesteter, Pg 126 The defiled person, then sits inside the outer enclosure but outside the ones enclosing holes 4-9 and rubs dust all over his body for it to dry.Darmesteter, Pg 127 He, then enters the inner furrows and steps in the holes 4-9 cleansing himself with the water contained in them. Once the ritual is complete, he may come out of the Barashnûm-gâh and is permitted to return to his house.Darmesteter, Pg 128 However, he is confined to a corner of the house called Armêsht-gah for nine nights. During this period, he is prohibited from contacting water, fire, earth, cow, trees and other Zoroastrians as he is considered to be impure and his contact is believed to defile the objects around him. Once every three days, he is enjoined to bathe himself and wash his clothes in gomez and water as a part of the purification ritual. On the completion of his third bath, he is considered to be \\"completely purified\\" and is permitted to lead a normal life.  Fee for the cleanser  The fee to be paid to the priest who cleanses an impure person is also specified in the Fargard 9 of the Vendidad.Darmesteter, Pg 129 The Fargard decrees that a fellow defiled priest should be cleansed in return for blessings, the lord of province for the payment of a camel, the lord of a town for the payment of a horse, the lord of a borough for the payment of a bull, and a householder in return for a three-year-old cow. The Vendidad also specifies the punishment to be handed to a priest who has erred in the rituals.

This annual week begins with World Vegetarian Day (October 1), which has been endorsed since 1977 by the International Vegetarian Union (IVU), which is headquartered in the U.K. Many countries and organisations have been proposing Vegetarian Weeks for several years, from Australia to the United Kingdom. Australia Vegetarian WeekUK National Vegetarian Week For many years, those Vegetarian Weeks have been mostly the effort of national organisations. The dates were different from country to country, and there was little or no international coordination or help. In 2008, a team of activists from different countries, before and around the 38th IVU World Vegetarian Congress,World Vegetarian Congress 2008 decided to coordinate activities cross-nationally to promote an annual International Vegetarian Week from October 1 to 7. This working team set up a specific website, which serves both as a means of informing about the IVW and as a tool to share ideas, resources, and promotional materials (available on the internet and in print). Vegetarian organisations and activists worldwide contribute materials and resources to the IVW, then the website serves as a central point to share the resources and ideas. In 2008, the first IVW was promoted in about 13 countries worldwide. This number has steadily increased in following years. The project has received the public support of famous vegetarians, including John Robbins, Rajendra Pachauri, Jean Ziegler, and Elroy Finn. Historical notes The period called International Vegetarian Week has for a long time been used as World Week of Prayer for Animals by religiously ethical vegetarians. Curiously, it covered the following three dates: * first full week of October * October 1–7, plus * two full weekends, usually on either end (before or after) October 4, the Feast Day of St. Francis However, though World Week of Prayer for Animals has overlapped and has been coterminous with the International Vegetarian Week, cultural, ideological, and political reasons often prevent its being noted in some (but not all) International Vegetarian Week announcements.

It was built on the original site of the University of Leipzig and served as its main building. History The Augusteum was built between 1831 and 1836 to plans by Albert Geutebrück, though its façade referred back to a classicist design by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. The building had, however, already reached its full capacity by the 1870s since the university had grown due to major urban expansion in this period. The building was generously rebuilt and expanded from 1892 to 1897 by the architect Arwed Rossbach. The Augusteum had originally only had a front onto the Augustusplatz, but, due to the demolition of the old Paulinum (i.e. the building of the medieval St. Paul's monastery and St. Paul's college), could now receive a south wing known as the Johanneum (1895), a middle wing known as the Albertinum (1896) and a west wing known as the Paulinum (1896). The renovation also altered the building's style to fit in better with other buildings on the Augustusplatz, with Neo-Renaissance and Neo Gothic façades being added to the Paulinerkirche and Augusteum to plans by Rossbach. The Augusteum was heavily damaged by bombing in the Second World War, so the East German government decided it was beyond repair and (like the fully intact Paulinerkirche) ill-fitting for their concept of a socialist-oriented university. Thus the two buildings were dynamited on 30 May 1968. This cleared an area on which a new university complex in functional and sober DDR architectural style was built in 1975. Until 1971 a rectory building was on the site of the Augusteum's main wing. After German reunification, a citizens' initiative for the reconstruction of the university church and Augusteum of Leipzig gathered, but after years of litigation, demands for reconstruction were waived in favour of the university's need for modern teaching and research facilities. A plan wa drawn up by Erick van Egeraat for a campus building recalling parts of the Augusteum's façade, and an auditorium designed to appear like the Paulinerkirche, but the historic main building of the university would not rise again. Reconstruction The new Augusteum as Leipzig University's main building with the Paulinum in 2012. In 2006, the campus at Augustusplatz, consisting of the main building (Hauptgebäude) at the place of the former Augusteum and Paulinerkirche, the lecture hall building (Hörsaalgebäude), seminar building (Seminargebäude) and dining hall building (Mensagebäude), began reconstruction. The new building for the faculty of economic sciences and parts of the renovated seminar building, the long- overdue new dining hall building, and other parts, including the new Augusteum and Paulinum have all been completed.

It was used by the British Army as an artillery tractor.  Development  There was a lack of British-developed four-wheel-drive vehicles developed during the war and no commercial demand for them afterwards. As a result, the Army, under the time's general assumption of indigenous sourcing, was forced to develop its own vehicle. The Hathi prototype was developed in 1922 by a team of P Company under Professor (honorary Colonel) Herbert Niblett (1872-1966) of the Royal Army Service Corps Training College, Aldershot, using parts of a German Erhardt tractor. Production models were built by Thornycroft, 25 being built in 1924. Niblett was Sir John Thornycroft's son- in-law. Although capable for its day, the Hathi was a complex and expensive vehicle that required regular maintenance if the front axle was to remain reliable. For most purposes it was soon replaced by 6×4 lorries with just as many driven wheels, but without the need for the complex combined driving and steering axle. Even half-tracks, particularly the Kégresse system, were more popular in this period.  Requirements  The first vehicle was built as an experimental prototype, but its success was so great that plans were made to produce them commercially. The specification of requirements was thus drawn up in October 1923, after the prototype had been trialled. These were: * Engine power of at least 80 bhp * Winch capacity of 5 long tons * Ability to cope with a 1 in 4 (25%) gradient, whilst towing a trailer load of 5 long tons * Ability to stop and start under control on a 1 in 5 gradient (20%) * Average speed of 22 mph over two hours. * 20 inches ground clearance in general, with at least 10 inches beneath the axles. The vehicle otherwise to be low in overall silhouette. * Turning circle of 55 feet. This required a short wheelbase, but the ditch and bank climbing requirements also limited the vehicle's overhang beyond its wheels. Together with the weight limit, this required an extremely compact vehicle. * Maximum weight of 5 long tons.  Construction  De-mobilised Hathi in Australia in 1945 Bodywork of the Hathi was typical for the time with a wide bench-seated open cab and not even a windscreen. The only weather protection was a folding canvas roof. Although the lack of cab was typical for the time, it had also been part of the requirement to maintain a low profile. As for other Thornycrofts the radiator surround was a massive casting (in aluminium, to save weight) topped by a brass header tank with the \\"Thornycroft\\" name prominently cast into it. A distinctive feature of the Hathi, appropriately giving its elephantine appearance, was the extreme width of the bonnet. The top panels of the bonnet cover were also noticeably concave and are recognisable in photos. Prominent spare wheels were mounted high up, on each side of the rear bodywork. = Engine = The engine was a Thornycroft GB6 11.3 litre straight-six petrol engine. As was common for the period, the cylinders were cast in two blocks of three. Valves used the \\"IOE\\" or \\"Inlet over Exhaust\\" arrangement, with overhead valves (in the head) for the inlets and side-valves (in the cylinder block) for the exhaust. Dry sump lubrication was used, to avoid problems when tilted off-road. To reduce weight, many cast components were in aluminium, rather than iron. = Transmission = Four wheel drive for heavy vehicles in this period was difficult and the Hathi used a complex arrangement of bevel gears to transmit drive through the steering joints of the front axle. Rather than the now–common system of articulated drive shafts to the front hubs (the shaft either inside an axle casing or external), fixed shafts were used. Shafts inside the axle casing carried power to the ends of the axle, then a bevel gear drove a short vertical shaft running through the steering kingpin. A further bevel on the outer part of the hub carrier (the part moving with the steering) drove the hub itself. The constant velocity joint used to make modern articulated drive shafts was unheard of as yet and even the simpler Hooke-type universal joint wasn't yet in common use. Thornycroft's usual practice for prop shafts at the time was to use a flexible leather disk joint. To save weight, the axle casings were cast in aluminium. = Wheels = Production Hathi used single steel disk wheels with 8 studs. The tyres were narrow by modern standards for an off-road vehicle and did not have the exaggerated tread pattern now common, or the bar grip pattern used during the WWII period. To provide a greater grip, typical experiments for the period were carried out, with double wheels and tyres fitted and with cleated tyre chains over these. The doubled wheels used a different wheel from standard, with a greater offset. = Drawbar and winch = The Hathi introduced a number of innovations that would become standard on military tractors in later years, including the well-known Scammells. The rear towing draw-bar consisted of a multiple-leaf horizontal leaf spring, spanning the rear chassis rails. This coupled the towing forces directly into the chassis, but also allowed jolts to be cushioned. When winching, the Hathi was fitted with chassis-mounted scotches that hinged down to hold the vehicle in place against the ground. These were stronger than chocking the wheels, quicker to deploy and also carried the winching forces directly into the chassis, rather than through the suspension. These were an innovation of the production Hathi, the prototype vehicle instead having used a precarious arrangement of wheel ramps that lifted the rear of the vehicle off the ground.  Experimental developments  = 6×6 = A single 6×6 Hathi was produced as an experiment. This was a new build vehicle, with a redesigned chassis. Once again, this was produced by P Company of the RASC Experimental Department. It was tested by the MWEE in May 1928. Double wheels were used with optional chains. As would later be used on other 6×4 vehicles, the single rear chains spanned both axles. Although successful in its trials, the 6×6 bogie suspension was the victim of its own success. The WD's development of its patented rear bogie suspension allowed 6×4 vehicles to be built on a commercial chassis, avoiding the complexity of the Hathi's driven front axle. Such vehicles had almost as good cross-country performance as the all-wheel-drive 6×6, but at lower cost and with the use of mass production commercial lorry factories, not military vehicle specialists. = Half-track = The Royal Marines also tested a single example of a half- track Hathi conversion, using tracks by the Roadless company. This was a relatively simple conversion, a Roadless speciality, using the existing rear axle of the Hathi as a combined drive sprocket and road wheel, with a two- wheel bogie and roadwheel idler ahead of this.  Service career  Initial production was as an artillery tractor, as at this time the RASC supplied transport to the Royal Field Artillery. Very few Hathi were built, possibly just the original batch of 25. = Use as a breakdown recovery vehicle = In 1926, at least one Hathi was converted as a breakdown recovery vehicle. A fixed jib with a small hand-operated winch was mounted on the rear deck, with the frame for a canvas tilt over it. Other examples were converted for the RAF and the Royal Navy, a naval example from Portsmouth Dockyard being the survivor today. = Australia = Eight Hathi gun tractors were procured in 1925 with Inspector General Chauvel proclaiming that \\"mechanization has been effected\\". They were being used in the early 1930s in Northern Australia. Hathi were still in reserve service in Australia in 1945.  Survival today  A single example survives today, in The REME Museum of Technology collection, although it is not on regular display.

EDO formed in late 2019 with the merger of eight separate state and territory organisations into one national organisation. Topics of interest to EDO include: climate change, biodiversity, water, and healthy communities. EDO has eight offices around Australia, located in: Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Canberra, Darwin, Hobart, Perth and Sydney.  Litigation  EDO represents members of the public and environmental groups in legal action which seeks to protect biodiversity, local communities and Australia's unique landscapes. EDO lawyers have been involved in some of Australia's biggest environmental legal battles, from the Adani mine and drilling in the Great Australian Bight, to protecting whales in the Antarctic.  Law reform  EDO lawyers regularly make submissions on aspects of environmental law reform and participate in Federal and State Government inquiries and consultation processes. EDO has advocated strongly for changes to the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to better protect Australia's unique wildlife and landscapes from ongoing threats.  Community engagement  EDO conducts workshops, seminars and webinars to inform members of the public about how to participate in the legal process and use the law to protect the environment. The organisation produces factsheets on matters of environmental law and its fortnightly Insight newsletter highlights opportunities to participate in government decision making.  Notable cases  = Gloucester Resources Limited v Minister for Planning [2019] NSWLEC 7 = In February 2019, EDO (as EDO NSW) secured a landmark legal victory, with the refusal of the proposed Rocky Hill coal mine in the New South Wales Upper Hunter region. A key factor in the win was the mine's potential impacts on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. = Bylong Coal Project (SSD 6367) = EDO (as EDO NSW) represented local community group, the Bylong Valley Protection Alliance, in opposing the 6.5 million tonnes-per-year open cut and underground mine – which would have been built in an area known for its scenic beauty and agricultural productivity. The Independent Planning Commission found that the proposed mine would have unacceptable impacts on groundwater and that the area could not be restored with the same scenic, heritage and natural values after the mine had closed. Significantly, the panel cited the Rocky Hill case in its decision, describing the emissions from the mine's coal as 'problematical'. It said the mine was not in the public interest because it was contrary to the principles of intergenerational equity. = The Environment Centre Northern Territory v The Northern Territory Environment Protection Authority and Anor = In a legal first in 2019, the Environment Centre Northern Territory (ECNT), represented by the EDO (as EDO NT), challenged a permit to allow the clearing of more than 20,000 hectares of Northern Territory native vegetation at Maryfield Station, including on climate change grounds. The successful case demonstrates the community's ability to hold governments to account for their decisions. = Ralphs Bay Tasmania = From 2008 to 2010, EDO (as EDO Tasmania) represented community group, Save Ralphs Bay Inc, against a proposed 460-lot canal housing and marina development in a conservation area at Lauderdale. This would have been the first canal estate proposal in Tasmania. = Mackay Conservation Group Vs Commonwealth of Australia = In 2015, EDO (as EDO NSW) successfully challenged the Federal Government's approval of Adani's Carmichael coal mine in central Queensland, on behalf of the Mackay Conservation Group (MCG).The case was won over the Federal Environment Minister's failure to take into account the approved conservation advices for the Yakka Skink and the Ornamental Snake. With the consent of the parties, the Court set aside the decision of the Minister because his decision was legally flawed. MCG also alleged that the Federal Environment Minister failed to properly consider the impact of the Carmichael mine on the Great Barrier Reef when he approved the project. = Humane Society International Inc v Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd = Acting on behalf of client Humane Society International – Australia (HSI), EDO (as EDO NSW) first took action against Japanese whaling company Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd (Kyodo) in 2004, to stop it from whaling in breach of Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (EPBC Act). Kyodo owned ships that conducted whaling in the Australian Whale Sanctuary for the Japanese Whale Research program. There was evidence that Kyodo had killed 3,558 minke whales and 13 fin whales since 2000/2001, with most of those killings taking place in the Sanctuary. The evidence also indicated that Kyodo intended to start taking humpback whales in the 2007/2008 season. This was a complex case run over several court appearances to establish the jurisdiction of the Federal Court and the right of HSI to serve documents on Kyodo. In 2008, EDO secured a victory when the Federal Court declared that Kyodo was breaching the EPBC Act. The Court granted an injunction to restrain Kyodo from further breaches. HSI representatives travelled to Japan to serve the injunction on Kyodo. But Japan didn't comply with that injunction and continued what it described as 'scientific' whaling in the Sanctuary between 2008 and 2013.  EDOs of Australia  Environmental Defenders' Offices (EDOs) of Australia was founded in 1996 and consisted of nine independently constituted and managed community environmental law centres located in States and Territories of Australia.

Rapidly growing in the 19th century, coffee in El Salvador has traditionally provided more than 50% of the country's export revenues, reaching a peak in 1980 with a revenue of more than $615 million. With the political and economic turmoil resulting from a civil war in the 1980s, the coffee industry has struggled to recover entirely, and by 1985 earned around $403 million from coffee. Brazil has been buying to sell the goods of El Salvador. Yields of green coffee, a Salvadoran speciality declined in absolute terms from 175,000 tons in 1979 to 141,000 tons in 1986; a 19 percent drop attributed directly to decreased levels of investment caused by the war. Since 2000, the industry has been greatly affected by increased competition from other countries on the world market, whose cheaper coffee beans have caused prices to plummet. As of 2002 coffee trading is only responsible for 3.5% of El Salvador's GNP and over 90% of El Salvador's coffee is grown in shade coffee plantations and around 80% of El Salvador's forests are associated with shade coffee plantations. Background Dark roasted coffee beans from El Salvador. Coffee was first cultivated in El Salvador for domestic use early in the 19th century. By mid- century its commercial promise was evident, and the government began to favor its production through legislation such as tax breaks for producers, exemption from military service for coffee workers, and elimination of export duties for new producers. By 1880 coffee had become virtually the sole export crop. Compared with Indigofera, previously the dominant export commodity, coffee was a more demanding crop. Since coffee bushes required several years to produce a usable harvest, its production required a greater commitment of capital, labor, and land than did indigo. Coffee also grew best at a certain altitude, whereas indigo flourished almost anywhere. Unlike those of Guatemala and Costa Rica, the Salvadoran coffee industry developed largely without the benefit of external technical and financial help. El Salvador nonetheless became one of the most efficient coffee producers in the world. This was especially true on the large coffee plantations, where the yield per hectare increased in proportion to the size of the plantation, a rare occurrence in plantation agriculture. The effect of coffee production on Salvadoran society has been immeasurable, not only in terms of land tenure but also because the coffee industry has served as a catalyst for the development of infrastructure (roads and railroads) and as a mechanism for the integration of indigenous communities into the national economy. Political obstacles In the decades prior to the civil conflict of the 1980s, export earnings from coffee allowed growers to expand production, finance the development of a cotton industry, and establish a light manufacturing sector. After 1979, however, government policies, guerrilla attacks, and natural disasters reduced investment, impeding the coffee industry's growth. To make matters worse, after a price jump in 1986 world coffee prices fell by 35 percent in 1987, causing coffee exports to decline in value from US$539 million to US$347 million. Government control of coffee marketing and export was regarded as one of the strongest deterrents to investment in the industry. In the first year of Incafe's existence, coffee yields dropped by over 20 percent. During each of the ensuing four years, yields were about 30 percent lower than those registered during the 1978-80 period. A Salvadoran coffee farmer. Although the area in production remained fairly constant at approximately 180,000 hectares, production of green coffee declined in absolute terms from 175,000 tons in 1979 to 141,000 tons in 1986; this 19 percent drop was a direct result of lower yields, which in turn were attributed to decreased levels of investment. According to the Salvadoran Coffee Growers Association (Asociacion Cafetalera de El Salvador—ACES), besides controlling the sale of coffee, Incafe also charged growers export taxes and service charges equal to about 50 percent of the sale price and was often late in paying growers for their coffee. Coffee growers also suffered from guerrilla attacks, extortion, and the imposition of so-called \\"war taxes\\" during the 1980s. These difficulties, in addition to their direct impact on production, also decreased investment. Under normal conditions, coffee growers replaced at least 5 percent of their coffee plants each year because the most productive coffee plants are between five and fifteen years old. Many coffee growers in El Salvador, in an effort to avoid further losses, neglected to replant. Although most coffee production took place in the western section of El Salvador, coffee growers who operated in the eastern region were sometimes compelled to strike a modus vivendi with the guerrillas. During the 1984-85 harvest, for example, the guerrillas added to their \\"war tax\\" demand a threat to attack any plantation they thought underpaid workers. They demanded that workers receive the equivalent of US$4.00 per 100 pounds picked, a US$1.00 increase over what was then the going rate. The fact that growers negotiated with the guerrillas—while the government looked the other way—demonstrated the continuing importance of coffee export revenue to both the growers and the government. History and political background Coffee would become the last of the great monoculture export commodities in El Salvador. Its widespread cultivation began in the mid-19th century as the world demand for indigo dye dried up. The huge profits that it yielded served as a further impetus for the process whereby land became concentrated in the hands of an oligarchy. Although legend and radical propaganda have quantified the oligarchy at the level of fourteen families, a figure of several hundred families lies much closer to the truth. A succession of presidents, nominally both conservative and liberal, throughout the last half of the 19th century supported the seizure of land from individual smallholders and communal owners. Despite the continued participation of conservatives, however, the period of the establishment of the coffee republic (roughly 1871 to 1927) is described commonly as the era of the liberal state in El Salvador. The church was not as powerful in El Salvador as in other Latin American states at the time; therefore, the economic aspects of liberalism—an adherence to the principles of free-market capitalism—dominated the conduct of the state. Anti-clericalism was a distinctly secondary theme, expressed primarily through social legislation (such as the establishment of secular marriage and education) rather than through the kind of direct action, e.g., repression and expropriation, taken against the church in 19th- and early 20th-century Mexico. Despite some differences over the degree of emphasis of political versus economic issues, Salvadoran liberals generally agreed on the promotion of coffee as the predominant cash crop, on the development of infrastructure (railroads and port facilities) primarily in support of the coffee trade, on the elimination of communal landholdings to facilitate further coffee production, on the passage of antivagrancy laws to ensure that displaced campesinos and other rural residents provided sufficient labor for the coffee fincas (plantations), and on the suppression of rural discontent. Fair trade coffee growers in Tacuba in western El Salvador. The coffee industry grew inexorably in El Salvador, after a somewhat tentative start in the mid-19th century. Between 1880 and 1914, the value of coffee exports rose by more than 1,100 percent. Although the coffee industry itself was not taxed by the government, tremendous revenue was raised indirectly through import duties on goods imported with the foreign currencies that coffee sales earned (goods intended for the consumption of the small coffee- producing elite). From 1870 to 1914, an average of 58.7 percent of government revenue derived from this source. Even if the coffee elite did not run the government directly (and many scholars argue that they did), the elite certainly provided the bulk of the government's financial support. This support, coupled with the humbler and more mundane mechanisms of corruption, ensured the coffee growers of overwhelming influence within the government and the military. The priorities of the coffee industry dictated a shift in the mission of the embryonic Salvadoran armed forces from external defense of the national territory to the maintenance of internal order. The creation of the National Guard (Guardia Nacional—GN) in 1912 epitomizes this change. The duties of the GN differed from those of the National Civil Police (Policia Nacional Civil—PNC), mainly in that GN personnel were specifically responsible for providing security on the coffee fincas. Most fincas enjoyed the services of their own GN units posted on the grounds; regional GN commanders routinely were compensated by the finca owners to ensure the continued loyalty of the guardsmen. Suppression of rural dissent was subtle and institutionalized; campesinos generally accepted the status quo because of the implied threat of retaliation from the GN or other military units. One exception to this pattern was Aquino's rebellion. Although it predated the coffee boom, its reverberations were felt throughout Salvadoran society for decades. A Fair trade coffee grower. Throughout the period of the liberal state in El Salvador, the preeminent position of the oligarchy was never threatened by the actions of the government. Some have attributed this to the pervasive influence of the organization that has been described as the \\"invisible government\\" of the country, the Coffee Growers Association (Asociacion Cafetalera). The direct (in the case of the Melendez-Quinonez minidynasty) and indirect connections of the presidents of the period with the country's powerful families undoubtedly came into play as well. Generally speaking, however, the system continued to function without adjustment because it worked well from the perspective of the small percentage of Salvadorans who benefited from it, namely the economic elite, upper-echelon government officials, and the military High Command. Although society in general appeared to be static under the liberal state, the same truly cannot be said for the Salvadoran oligarchy. The introduction of coffee production in itself changed the composition of that group, as the new coffee barons joined the ranks of the old plantation owners (who in many cases were slow to recognize the potential of coffee and lost some wealth and standing by delaying their switch from indigo production). New blood also was introduced into the oligarchy by way of foreign immigration. These immigrants, who would eventually come to constitute the bulk of the Salvadoran merchant class, frequently married into the landowning oligarchic families, further diversifying the composition of the elite stratum of society. Another process worthy of note during this period despite its lack of tangible results was the ongoing series of unification efforts by the Central American states. El Salvador was a prime mover in most of these attempts to reestablish an isthmian federation. In 1872 El Salvador signed a pact of union with Guatemala, Honduras, and Costa Rica but the union was never implemented. In 1876 a congress of all five Central American states failed to achieve agreement on federation. A provisional pact signed by the five states in 1889 technically created the \\"Republic of Central America\\" - that was never realized. Undaunted, the governments of El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua formed the \\"Greater Republic of Central America\\" (República Mayor de Centroamerica) via the Pact of Amapala (1895). Although Guatemala and Costa Rica considered joining the Greater Republic (which was rechristened \\"the United States of Central America\\" when its constitution went into effect in 1898), neither country joined. This union, which had planned to establish its capital city at Amapala on the Golfo de Fonseca, did not survive Tomas Regalado's seizure of power in El Salvador in 1898. Although the Central American spirit seemed willing, the commitment was weak. The notion of unification was another manifestation of the idealistic liberal ethos, and it proved durable and quite resistant to political realities. Recent developments The Ciudad Barrios Cooperative inspecting their coffee. Coffee production flourished in El Salvador throughout much of the 20th century, reaching a peak in the late 1970s, culminating in 1980 when it was responsible for 50% of El Salvador's gross domestic product (GDP). With the political and economic turmoil resulting from a civil war in the 1980s, the coffee industry struggled to recover entirely and, by 1985, earned around $403 million from coffee. Yields of green coffee, a Salvadoran speciality, declined in absolute terms from 175,000 tons in 1979 to 141,000 tons in 1986; a 19% drop attributed directly to decreased levels of investment caused by the war. The coffee industry in El Salvador has shown a greater decline in recent years and since 2000, the industry has been greatly affected by increased competition from other countries on the world market, whose cheaper coffee beans have caused prices to plummet. As of 2002 coffee trading is responsible for 3.5% of El Salvador's GDP. Since 2000, 70,000 have lost their jobs as a result of the rapid decline in the Salvadoran coffee trade. The heavy coffee production of the past has taken its toll on the environment in many areas of the country. In some parts of El Salvador coffee is still highly important to the economy. The Ciudad Barrios Cooperative, for instance, operating in the Cacahuatique mountains of eastern El Salvador since the late 1970s, was producing approximately 8.5 million pounds of coffee annually until 2003. The Cooperative has since been involved with organizations such as USAID which has aided small and medium-sized Salvadoran coffee producers to produce for international higher-grade coffee markets, and was awarded a Rainforest Alliance certification. Other coffee producers have also been increasingly influenced by international campaign organizations, with many producers now cultivating fair trade coffee. Labor issues Harvesting coffee has been determined by national law as a hazardous activity. In 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that 6.3% of children aged 5 to 14 were working children and that 56% of them engaged in child labor in the agricultural sector, harvesting coffee among other dangerous activities. Coffee has also been listed in the department's 2014 List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor among 4 other goods from the agricultural sector for the most part.

The tortilla is sometimes lightly grilled or steamed to soften it, make it more pliable, and allow it to adhere to itself when wrapped. Burritos are often eaten by hand, as their tight wrapping keeps the ingredients together. Burritos can also be served \\"wet\\", that is to say covered in a savory and spicy sauce, where they would be eaten with a fork and knife. Burritos are filled with a savory filling, most often a meat such as chicken, beef, or pork, and often include a large array of other ingredients such as rice, cooked beans (either whole or refried), vegetables such as lettuce and tomatoes, cheese, and condiments such as salsa, pico de gallo, guacamole, or crema. Burritos are often contrasted with other, similar, dishes such as tacos, in which a small hand-sized tortilla is folded in half around the ingredients rather than wrapped and sealed, or with enchiladas which use masa (maize/corn) tortillas and are covered in a savory sauce, to be eaten with a fork and knife. Etymology The word burrito means \\"little donkey\\" in Spanish, being the diminutive form of burro, or \\"donkey\\". The name burrito, as applied to the dish, possibly derives from the tendency for burritos to contain a lot of different things similar to how a donkey would be able to carry a lot. History A basic burrito with meat, refried beans, sauce and cheese Before the development of the modern burrito, the Mesoamerican peoples of Mexico used corn tortillas in 10,000 B.C. to wrap foods, with fillings of chili peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms, squash, and avocados. Historically, the Pueblo peoples of the Southwestern US also made tortillas filled with beans and meat sauce and prepared much like the modern burrito. But these preparations could also be said to be the origin of the simpler taco, rather than the modern burrito. The precise origin of the modern burrito is not known. In the 1895 Diccionario de Mejicanismos by Feliz Ramos i Duarte, the burrito or taco was identified as a regional item from the Mexican state of Guanajuato and defined as \\"Tortilla arrollada, con carne u otra cosa dentro, que en Yucatán llaman coçito, y en Cuernavaca y en Mexico, taco\\" (A rolled tortilla with meat or other ingredients inside, called 'coçito' in Yucatán and 'taco' in the city of Cuernavaca and in Mexico City). Some have speculated that it may have originated with vaqueros, the cowboys of northern Mexico in the 19th century. An often repeated piece of folk history is the story of a man named Juan Méndez who sold tacos at a street stand in the Bella Vista neighborhood of Ciudad Juárez during the Mexican Revolution period (1910–1921), while using a donkey as a transport for himself and his food.See, e.g., To keep the food warm, Méndez wrapped it in large homemade flour tortillas underneath a small tablecloth. As the \\"food of the burrito\\" (i.e., \\"food of the little donkey\\") grew in popularity, \\"burrito\\" was eventually adopted as the name for these large tacos. Another creation story tells of Ciudad Juárez in the 1940s, where a street food vendor created the tortilla- wrapped food to sell to poor children at a state-run middle school. The vendor would call the children his \\"burritos\\", because burro is a colloquial term for a dunce or dullard. Eventually, the somewhat derogatory, but endearing, term for the children was transferred to the food that they ate. In 1923, Alejandro Borquez opened the Sonora Cafe in Los Angeles that later changed its name to El Cholo Spanish Cafe. Burritos first appeared on American restaurant menus at the El Cholo Spanish Cafe in Los Angeles during the 1930s. Burritos were mentioned in the U.S. media for the first time in 1934, appearing in the Mexican Cookbook, a collection of regional recipes from New Mexico that was written by historian Erna Fergusson. In 1956, a frozen burrito was developed in Southern California. Development of regional varieties =Mexico= Burritos are a traditional food of Ciudad Juárez, a city bordering El Paso, Texas, in the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua, where people buy them at restaurants and roadside stands. Northern Mexican border towns like Villa Ahumada have an established reputation for serving burritos. Authentic Mexican burritos are usually small and thin, with flour tortillas containing only one or two of several ingredients: either some form of meat or fish, potato, rice, beans, asadero cheese, chile rajas, or chile relleno. Other ingredients may include: barbacoa, mole, refried beans and cheese (a \\"bean and cheese\\" burrito), or deshebrada (shredded slow-cooked flank steak). The deshebrada burrito has a variation with chile (mild to moderately hot) and one with salsa verde (very hot). The Mexican burrito may be a northern variation of the traditional taco de Canasta, which is eaten for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Although burritos are one of the most popular examples of Mexican cuisine outside of Mexico, they are only popular in the northern part of Mexico. However, they are beginning to appear in some nontraditional venues in other parts of Mexico. Wheat flour tortillas (used in burritos) are now often seen throughout much of Mexico (possibly due to these areas being less than optimal for growing maize or corn), despite at one time being particular to northwestern Mexico, the Southwestern US Mexican-American community, and Pueblo Indian tribes. Burritos are commonly called tacos de harina (\\"wheat flour tacos\\") in Central Mexico and Southern Mexico, and burritas (the feminine variation with 'a') in \\"northern-style\\" restaurants outside of northern Mexico proper. A long and thin fried burrito called a chivichanga, which is similar to a chimichanga, is prepared in the state of Sonora and vicinity.Bayless, Rick and Deann Groen Bayless. (1987). Authentic Mexican: Regional Cooking from the Heart of Mexico. Morrow Cookbooks. p. 142. A variation of the burrito found in the Mexican state of Sonora is known as the burro percherón.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myXoDBqRlFs = San Francisco = Mission-style burrito, showing rice, meat, and beans. The origins of the Mission burrito or Mission-style burrito can be traced back to San Francisco, in the Mission District taquerías of the 1960s and 1970s. This type of burrito is produced on a steam table assembly line, and is characterized by a large stuffed flour tortilla wrapped in aluminum foil, and may include fillings such as carne asada (beef), Mexican-style rice, whole beans (not refritos), sour cream and onion. Febronio Ontiveros claims to have offered the first retail burrito in San Francisco in 1961 at El Faro (\\"The Lighthouse\\"), a corner grocery store on Folsom Street. Ontiveros claims credit for inventing the \\"super burrito\\", a style which may have led to the early development of the \\"San Francisco style\\". This innovative style involves the addition of rice, sour cream and guacamole to the standard burrito of meat, beans, and cheese. The Mission burrito emerged as a regional culinary movement during the 1970s and 1980s. The popularity of San Francisco-style burritos has grown locally at Mission Street taquerias like El Farolito, and nationally at chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill, Illegal Pete's, Chevy's Fresh Mex, Freebirds World Burrito, Qdoba, and Barberitos. Chili's had a brief stint with \\"Fresh Mex\\" foods and burritos between 2015 and 2017. In 1995, World Wrapps opened in San Francisco's Marina District and brought a burrito-inspired wrap style to the restaurant industry. =San Diego= Contents of a carne asada burrito San Diego-style burritos include \\"California burritos\\" and carne asada burritos. The style has been described by food writers as an \\"austere meal of meat, cheese and salsa\\", a contrast to the Mission-style burrito, which is typically larger and always contains more ingredients. A significant subgroup of Mexican restaurants in San Diego serves burritos described as \\"no-frills\\" and, in contrast to Mission-style burritos, the assembly line is not used. In the early 1960s, Roberto Robledo opened a tortilleria in San Diego and learned the restaurant business. Robledo began selling small bean burritos (or burrititos) at La Lomita in the late 1960s, and by 1970, he had established the first Roberto's Taco Shop. By 1999, Roberto's restaurants had expanded to a chain of 60 taco shops offering fresh burritos known for their distinctive quality. Hoping to draw on the prestige of Roberto's, new taco shops in San Diego began using the \\"-bertos\\" suffix, with names like Alberto's, Filiberto's, Hilberto's, and others. Contents of a California burrito The California burrito originated at an unknown -berto's named restaurant in San Diego in the 1980s. The Fresh MXN chain (formerly Santana's) also claimed to be the originator of the California burrito. The earliest-known published mention was in a 1995 article in the Albuquerque Tribune. The California burrito typically consists of chunks of carne asada meat, French fries, cheese, and either cilantro, pico de gallo, sour cream, onion, or guacamole (or some combination of these five). The ingredients are similar to those used in the \\"carne asada fries\\" dish, and it is considered a staple of the local cuisine of San Diego.See for example: With the merging of French fries and more traditional burrito fillings, the California burrito is an example of fusion border food. The California burrito has also been described as a \\"trans-class\\" food item, as it is regularly consumed by people across socioeconomic lines. Variants of this burrito may add shrimp (surf and turf), or substitute carnitas (pork) or chicken for carne asada. The carne asada burrito is considered one of the regional foods of San Diego. Carolynn Carreno has said that to San Diegans, \\"carne asada burritos are as integral to the experience of the place as a slice of (pizza) pie is to a New Yorker.\\" The San Diego-style carne asada burrito is served with chunks of carne asada, guacamole, and pico de gallo salsa.Billing, Karen. \\"Roberto's restaurant provides beach burrito bliss.\\" Del Mar Times, Aug. 17, 2007. (Partial version retrieved from http://www.robertos.us/articles.php , 15 Jan 2013.) This \\"wall- to-wall\\" use of meat contrasts to burrito styles that use rice and beans as filler ingredients. =Los Angeles= Los Angeles also has several unique local burrito varieties. The first is the most traditional and is exemplified by the versions at Mexican-American restaurants such as Al & Bea's, Lupe's #2, and Burrito King. These restaurants have often been in existence for decades, and they offer a distinctly Americanized menu compared with the typical taqueria. The burrito of L.A. itself can take multiple forms, but is almost always dominated by some combination of: refried beans, meat (often stewed beef or chili), and cheese (usually cheddar), with rice and other ingredients typical of Mission burritos offered as add-ons, if at all. The most basic version of this burrito consists of only beans and cheese; beyond this, there are the \\"green chile\\" and \\"red chile\\" burritos, which may simply mean the addition of chiles or a meatless chile sauce to the plain beans (as at Al & Bea's), meat or cheese as well. Rice, again, is rarely included, which, along with the choice of chiles, is one of the style's most defining traits. The menu will then usually go on to list multiple other combinations, such as beef and bean, all-beef, a \\"special\\" with further ingredients, etc. If the restaurant also offers hamburgers and sandwiches, it may sell a burrito version of these, such as a \\"hot dog burrito\\". In addition to the version described, Los Angeles is also home to three burrito styles that can be said to fall under the category of Mexican fusion cuisine. The first is the famed \\"kosher burrito,\\" served since 1946 at its eponymous restaurant at 1st Street and Main in Downtown Los Angeles. Another is the Korean kogi burrito, invented by American chef Roy Choi, the first to combine Mexican and Korean cuisines. The kogi burrito was named the seventh best burrito in Los Angeles in 2012 by the LA Weekly. The kogi burrito is accented with chile-soy vinaigrette, sesame oil, and fresh lime juice. Food writer Cathy Chaplin has said that \\"this is what Los Angeles tastes like.\\" Finally, there is the sushi burrito, most notably the version sold at the Jogasaki food truck. Wrapped in flour tortillas, sushi burritos include such fillings as spicy tuna, tempura, and cucumber. The existence of such a large truly Mexican community in Los Angeles also makes it possible to find a variety of authentic burrito dishes from different regions of Mexico: from Oaxaca to Hidalgo. Variations and similar dishes *A wet burrito is covered with a red chili sauce similar to a red enchilada sauce, with melted shredded cheese on top. It is usually eaten from a plate using a knife and fork, rather than eaten with the hands.Palmatier, Robert Allen. (2000) Food: a dictionary of literal and nonliteral terms Greenwood Press. p. 372. This variety is sometimes called \\"smothered\\", \\"enchilada-style\\", mojado (Spanish for \\"wet\\"), or suizo (\\"Swiss\\"; used in Spanish to indicate dishes topped with cheese or cream). The Beltline Bar in Grand Rapids, Michigan, is said to have introduced the wet burrito in 1966. *A burrito bowl is not technically a burrito despite its name, as it consists of burrito fillings served without the tortilla. The fillings are placed in a bowl, and a layer of rice is put at the bottom. In 2017, a Meal, Ready-to-Eat version of a burrito bowl was introduced. It is not to be confused with a taco salad, which has a foundation of lettuce inside a fried tortilla (tostada). *A breakfast burrito, a take on the American breakfast, is composed of breakfast items, particularly scrambled eggs, wrapped in a flour tortilla. This style was invented and popularized in several regional American cuisines, most notably New Mexican cuisine, Southwestern cuisine, Californian cuisine, and Tex-Mex. *A chimichanga is a deep-fried burrito popular in Southwestern and Tex-Mex cuisines, and in the Mexican states of Sinaloa and Sonora.Sen, Amit. (2005). Academic Dictionary of Cooking Isha Books. p. 84. *A taco is similar to a burrito, but is served open rather than closed, is generally smaller, and is often made with corn flour rather than wheat. The taco editor of Texas Monthly argues that burritos are a type of taco.

Vol. 46, Num. 3. This is a well-known cooking technique used by some San Francisco taquerias and Northern Mexican burrito stands. Traditionally, grilled burritos are cooked on a comal (griddle).

This was the 20th inauguration and marked the commencement of the second and final term of Abraham Lincoln as President and only term of Andrew Johnson as Vice President. Lincoln was assassinated days into this term, and Johnson succeeded to the presidency. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase administered the presidential oath of office. This was the first inauguration to feature African Americans in the inaugural parade. Vice-presidential oath and inaugural address Before the president was sworn in, Vice President-elect Andrew Johnson took his oath of office at the Senate Chamber. At the ceremony Johnson, who had been drinking to offset the pain of typhoid fever (as he explained later), gave a rambling address in the Senate chamber and appeared obviously intoxicated.Trefousse p. 198 Historian Eric Foner has labeled the inauguration \\"a disaster for Johnson\\" and his speech \\"an unfortunate prelude to Lincoln's memorable second inaugural address.\\" At the time Johnson was ridiculed in the press as a \\"drunken clown\\". Photography This was the first inauguration to be extensively photographed, and the pictures have since become iconic. One is widely thought to show John Wilkes Booth, who would later assassinate Lincoln. center Inaugural address While Lincoln did not believe his address was particularly well received at the time, it is now generally considered one of the finest speeches in American history. Historian Mark Noll has deemed it \\"among the handful of semisacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world.\\" :Fellow–Countrymen: : At this second appearing to take the oath of the Presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first. Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself, and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured. : On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought to avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war—seeking to dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came. : One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces, but let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. \\"Woe unto the world because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh.\\" If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said \\"the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.\\" : With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.\\"Abraham Lincoln: Second Inaugural Address\\" Saturday, March 4, 1865.

He hosted The Jerry Springer Show, a tabloid talk show, between September 30, 1991 and July 26, 2018 and debuted the Jerry Springer Podcast in 2015. Springer currently hosts a courtroom show called Judge Jerry. Early life Gerald Norman Springer was born in the London Underground station of Highgate while the station was in use as a shelter from German bombing during World War II, and grew up on Chandos Road, East Finchley. His parents, Margot (née Kallmann; a bank clerk) and Richard Springer (owner of a shoe shop), were Jewish refugees who escaped from Landsberg an der Warthe, Prussia (now Gorzów Wielkopolski, Poland).Who do you think you are BBC documentary His maternal grandmother, Marie Kallmann, who was left behind, died in the gas trucks of Chełmno extermination camp (German-occupied Poland). His paternal grandmother, Selma Springer (née Elkeles), died at the hospital in the Theresienstadt concentration camp (German-occupied Czechoslovakia). Selma Springer's brother, Hermann Elkeles, was a renowned Berlin doctor who also died at Theresienstadt concentration camp. In January 1949, at the age of six, Springer immigrated with his parents to the United States, settling in Kew Gardens, Queens, New York. He later attended Forest Hills High School. One of his earliest memories about current events was when he was 12 and watching the 1956 Democratic National Convention on television where he saw and was impressed by John F. Kennedy.Powers and Johnson, 1998; also, Waldman, 2006 =Education and pre-political career= Springer earned a B.A. degree from Tulane University in 1965, majoring in political science.\\"Springer, Gerald N.\\" Tulane University Alumni Directory 2002, New Orleans: Tulane U. p. 761 He earned a J.D. degree from Northwestern University in 1968. Political career In 1970, Springer ran for Congress. He failed to unseat incumbent Republican Donald D. Clancy, but took 45% of the vote in a traditionally Republican district. He had previously spearheaded the effort to lower the voting age, including testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of ratification of the 26th Amendment. Three days after announcing his candidacy, Springer, who was also an Army reservist at the time, was called to active duty and deployed to Fort Knox. He resumed his campaign after he was discharged. Springer was elected to the Cincinnati City Council in 1971. He resigned in 1974 after admitting to soliciting a prostitute. In 1977, he was chosen to serve one year as mayor by the City Council. In 1982, Springer sought the Democratic nomination for governor of Ohio. TV commercials for Springer's campaign referenced his use of a check to pay a prostitute, saying that he was not afraid of the truth \\"even if it hurts\\". Springer considered running for the United States Senate in 2000 and 2004, but he backed down due to negative associations with The Jerry Springer Show. Politics to journalism Springer was hired as a political reporter and commentator on Cincinnati's NBC affiliate, WLWT, which had, at the time, the lowest-rated news program. Later, having been named primary news anchor and Managing Editor, he needed a broadcast catchphrase in the model of other great newsmen. With the help of some others at WLWT, he created his signature line: \\"Take care of yourself, and each other.\\" Within two years he was Cincinnati's number-one news anchor, along with partner Norma Rashid. For five years, he was the most popular one in the city, garnering ten local Emmy Awards for his nightly commentaries, which were frequently satirized by Cincinnati radio personality Gary Burbank. Those commentaries would eventually become his \\"Final Thought\\" on Springer. Springer would remain commentator at WLWT until January 1993. He resided in Loveland, Ohio, during this time. In 1997, the Chicago-based NBC-owned station WMAQ-TV hired Springer to serve as a news commentator. However, this proved to be unpopular among viewers, as it resulted in the resignation of long-time news anchors Ron Magers and Carol Marin. After performing only two commentaries, Springer resigned as commentator. Hosting =The Jerry Springer Show= In early 1994, Springer and his new producer, Richard Dominick, revamped the show's format in order to garner higher ratings. The show became more successful as it became targeted toward tabloidish sensationalism. Guests were everyday people confronted on a television stage by a spouse or family member's adultery, homosexuality, prostitution, transvestism, hate group membership, or other controversial situations. These confrontations were often promoted by scripted shouting or violence on stage. The show received substantial ratings and much attention. By 1998, it was beating The Oprah Winfrey Show in many cities, and was reaching more than 6.7 million viewers.Waxman, 1998 On July 10, 2002, the sons of guest Nancy Campbell-Panitz – who was murdered by her ex-husband after they appeared on a May 2000 episode with his girlfriend – filed suit in Sarasota County against Springer, his producers, and his distributor, claiming he created \\"a mood that led to murder.\\"Note: online sources that call her \\"Nanny\\" seem to be in error. Most media reports say that her first name was Nancy. For example, In 2005, a UK version of the show aired on Britain's ITV network titled The Springer Show. A subdued and more tongue-in-cheek version of the U.S. show, it beat its talk-show rival Trisha Goddard five to one in the ratings. The VH1 \\"celebreality\\" series The Springer Hustle, which took a look at how The Jerry Springer Show is produced, premiered in April 2007. In April 2015, Springer debuted The Jerry Springer Podcast on his website, JerrySpringer.com.Along with Jerry, the show is co-hosted by Jene Galvin and Megan Hils. The show is also produced by Jene Galvin. New episodes emerge from the Folk School Coffee Parlor in Ludlow, Kentucky. Technical crew is Ambient Studios and Panoptic Media. Jerry Springer is the second American talk show host to travel to Cuba, after Conan O'Brien, for the Jerry Springer Podcast. =Other= Springer in January 2011 Springer hosted America's Got Talent on NBC in the U.S. for two seasons, replacing Regis Philbin, before leaving to concentrate on other projects. From January 17, 2005, to December 5, 2006, Springer hosted Springer on the Radio, a liberal talk show on Cincinnati's WCKY-AM. He did the show from the Clear Channel studios in Kenwood on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays, and in Chicago (where his television show taped at the time) on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. From 2010 to 2015, Springer hosted a dating game show called Baggage, which aired on GSN.

Springer guest hosted the 22nd-season premiere episode of WWE Raw on September 8, 2014 in an attempt to conduct an intervention with The Bella Twins.  UK  After a few years of his U.S. talk show being broadcast in the UK, ITV approached Springer, who temporarily co-hosted This Morning with Judy Finnigan in March 1999 and again in 2000. In summer 1999, ITV made 12 episodes of the UK-based version of the series, Jerry Springer UK, filmed at the same studios as his US show. In September 1999, Jerry made a pilot for a Letterman-style talk show for ITV called Jerry Springer on Sunday. The show received good reviews and ratings and a further four episodes were commissioned to be broadcast in May 2000. The series was picked up by Channel 5 and renamed Late Night with Jerry Springer. Two series were made in 2000 and 2001 with 16 episodes. While working for Channel 5 In 2001, he was the host of the UK version of Greed, and a stand in host for The Wright Stuff. Springer covered the 2016 United States presidential election for ITV's Good Morning Britain. Acting career Springer starred in the 1998 film Ringmaster as a talk show host largely based on himself, though named \\"Jerry Farrelly\\". Ringmaster offers a behind-the-scenes look at would-be guests who apply to a Springer-like show. The same year, Springer also released an unrelated autobiography named Ringmaster. He quipped, \\"I can only think of one title a year.\\" =As himself= Other television appearances He was interviewed by satirist Chris Morris in his surreal radio series Blue Jam (Series 2, Episode 6). On January 23, 2004, Springer was featured in an episode of This American Life titled \\"Leaving the Fold\\". In late 2006, Springer was a contestant on the third season of Dancing with the Stars, with his professional dance partner, Kym Johnson. He wanted to appear on the show so he could learn the waltz for the wedding of his daughter, Katie. Springer and Johnson were eliminated in the seventh week of competition. Springer appeared in an episode of BBC One's television series Who Do You Think You Are? on August 27, 2008. Other projects Springer giving a speech at Emory University in 2007 On May 16, 2008, Springer delivered the Northwestern University School of Law commencement address. Although many students had criticized the University's choice of speaker, he received a standing ovation from about half the audience and reviews of his speech were generally positive. He later stated that his speech was about \\"the ethical judgments we all have to make in whatever business we go [into]\\". Personal life Springer married Micki Velton in 1973 and had one daughter, Katie Springer (born 1976). They divorced in 1994. Springer tends to keep his personal life private.

Originally raised for the 1st Australian Imperial Force during the First World War, it was formed just six weeks after the start of the war. Along with the 14th, 15th and 16th Battalions which were recruited from New South Wales, it formed the 4th Brigade. The battalion saw service initially at Gallipoli before being transferred to France in 1916. For the next two years it fought in the trenches of the Western Front, earning numerous battle honours in the process. Following the end of the war, the 13th Battalion was demobilised in early 1919. It was re-raised in 1921 as a unit of the part-time Citizens Force, based around Maitland, New South Wales. During the Second World War the battalion undertook garrison duties before being amalgamated with the 33rd Battalion in October 1942. It was re-raised for a third and final time sometime after 1948 and remained on the order of battle until 1960 when it was subsumed into the Royal New South Wales Regiment. History =First World War= Following the outbreak of war, the Australian government announced the decision to raise an all volunteer force for overseas service known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Recruitment for this force began quickly and the 13th Battalion was among some of the first battalions to be raised, doing so in late September 1914, only six weeks after the declaration of war. Drawing its manpower from the state of New South Wales, it undertook training at the ANZAC Rifle Range in Long Bay, Sydney and Broadmeadows and Williamstown in Melbourne. It left Australia from Albany in late December and arrived in Egypt in February 1915. Along with the rest of the 4th Brigade, under the command of then Colonel John Monash, the 13th Battalion took part in the Landing at Anzac Cove, arriving late on 25 April 1915. For the first four months, between May and August, they undertook defensive operations as the Anzacs attempted to establish themselves on the narrow beachhead that had been captured on the peninsula. On 8 August 1915 an attempt was made to break out from this position and the battalion took part in a costly, and only partially successful, attack on Hill 971. Later in the month, on 27 August, they were involved in another attack, this time on Hill 60, during which they suffered further casualties. After this the 13th Battalion was mainly used in a defensive role until the final evacuation in December 1915. Portrait of Australian World War I Victoria Cross recipient, Major Harry Murray. In February 1917, then-Captain Murray led 'A' company of the 13th Battalion in an attack on \\"Stormy Trench\\", capturing the position and defending it against three German counter-attacks. From there, the battalion returned to Egypt where the AIF underwent a period of training and reorganisation which saw the raising of two new divisions which effectively doubled its size. As a part of this expansion, the 13th Battalion was split and provided a cadre of soldiers who had served at Gallipoli to provide experienced men to the newly raised 45th Battalion. At the same time the reconstituted 4th Brigade was allocated to the Australian 4th Division along with the 12th and 13th Brigades. In June 1916, the battalion embarked for France to join other units of II Anzac Corps, and for the next two years it served in the trenches along the Western Front. During this time, the 13th Battalion saw action in a number of major battles. The first such action that they were involved in came at Pozières in August 1916. Later, in February 1917, Captain Harry Murray, became the first member of the battalion to earn the Victoria Cross when he was involved in an attack near Gueudecourt. Later, at Bullecourt in April, the battalion, along with most of the 4th Brigade, suffered heavy losses when they ran up against a strongly defended German position without the tank support that they had been promised. After that, the 13th Battalion spent most of the remainder of 1917 in Belgium, as the Allied armies slowly advanced towards the heavily-defended Hindenburg Line. In March 1918, the Germans launched the Spring Offensive, which saw them gain considerable ground before being halted. During this time, the 13th Battalion undertook defensive operations in an effort to stem the tide. Later, a brief lull in the fighting occurred before the Allies launched their own offensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive, which ultimately brought about an end to the war. The 13th Battalion was involved at the outset, taking part in the fighting around Amiens on 8 August 1918, which produced considerable gains for the Allies and was subsequently described as one of the greatest successes in a single day on the Western Front. On 18 September, the battalion took part in its last offensive action, this time around Le Verguier, and it was here that Sergeant Maurice Buckley, serving under the assumed name of Gerald Sexton, performed the deeds that led to him being awarded the Victoria Cross. On 11 November 1918, an armistice came into effect and the fighting ended. Over the course of the next five months the battalion's personnel were slowly returned to Australia for demobilisation and discharge. On 18 March 1919, the battalion was finally disbanded, when its remaining personnel were formed into the 13th Composite Battalion along with drafts from the 14th, 15th and 16th Battalions. During the course of the war, the battalion lost 1,090 men killed and 2,128 wounded. =Interwar years, the Second World War and beyond= In 1921, the decision was made to perpetuate the numerical designations and battle honours of the AIF by re-raising those units as part of the Citizens Force. This was done by reorganising the existing Citizens Forces units so that they would adopt the identity of the AIF units that had been recruited within their regions and in which many of the pre-war citizen soldiers had served. As a result, by 1924, the 13th Battalion had been re-raised in the Maitland, New South Wales region. Upon formation, the newly raised battalion had drawn personnel from parts of the 13th and 22nd Infantry Regiments, and through its link with these units inherited the battle honour \\"South Africa 1900–1902\\". In 1927, territorial titles were introduced and the battalion adopted the title of the \\"Maitland Regiment\\", and the unit received its battle honours for the First World War. By 1928 it had been assigned to the 1st Brigade, attached to the 1st Division. Following the election of the Scullin Labor government in 1929, the compulsory training scheme was suspended and the Citizens Forces became an all volunteer force. In order to reflect its voluntary basis, it was subsequently renamed the \\"Militia\\" at this time. The decision to suspend compulsory training, as well as the hardships associated with the Great Depression meant that many Militia units were afflicted by low manning levels. As a consequence of this, it was decided to amalgamate a number of units. The 13th Battalion was not one of the units affected by this decision, and it remained under the command of the 1st Brigade, which was headquartered in Newcastle, New South Wales as a subordinate unit of the 2nd Military District, until the start of the Second World War in September 1939. During the war, because of the provisions of the Defence Act (1903), which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory, the decision was made to raise an all volunteer force to serve overseas – the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) – while the Militia would be used to undertake garrison duties in Australia. The compulsory training scheme was also re-instituted at this time and the Militia were called up for periods of continuous training that varied between 30 and 90 days. In October 1942, however, the battalion was amalgamated with the 33rd Battalion to form the 13th/33rd Battalion. Around this time, the battalion's machine gun company was detached and in conjunction with several other Militia machine gun companies, it was used to form the 6th Machine Gun Battalion. The 13th/33rd Battalion was itself later disbanded on 25 November 1943 when it became surplus to Army requirements. In 1948, with the completion of the demobilisation process, the Citizens Force was re-raised as the Citizens Military Force (CMF), which was established on a restricted establishment of two divisions. The 13th Battalion (Maitland Regiment) was re-established sometime after this date. In 1952, it was re-designated as the \\"Macquarie Regiment\\". In 1960, the Australian Army adopted the Pentropic divisional establishment, the result of which was the reduction of a number of CMF units which were amalgamated to form larger Pentropic battalions as part of six new State-based regiments. At this time, the 13th Battalion was reduced to a company-level formation in the 2nd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, being designated 'D' (Macquarie) Company. In 1961, the 13th Battalion was entrusted with the battle honours of the 2nd AIF's 2/13th Battalion. When the Pentropic establishment was abandoned in 1965 the CMF was re-organised once more and most of the previously existing regional battalions were re-raised, but the 13th Battalion was not one of those units and it remained off the Army's order of battle. Battle honours For their service, the 13th Battalion received the following battle honours: * \\"South Africa 1900–1902\\" (inherited); * First World War: Somme 1916, Somme 1918, Pozières, Bullecourt, Messines 1917, Ypres 1917, Menin Road, Polygon Wood, Passchendaele, Arras 1918, Ancre 1918, Hamel, Amiens, Albert 1918, Hindenburg Line, Epehy, France and Flanders 1916–1918, ANZAC, Landing at ANZAC, Defence at ANZAC, Suvla, Sari Bair.

It is characterized by the use in everyday conversation of certain words, theological terms, puns and catchphrases, in ways that may be only comprehensible within the context of a particular Christian sect or denomination. The terms used do not necessarily come from the Bible itself. They may have come into use through discussions about doctrine, through the social history of the Christian church at large, or in the unique history of a specific denomination or movement. In the developed Christian context, particular terms like God and Christ (or Jesus) as well as more common terms such as faith, truth and spirit have a rich history of meaning to refer to concepts in spirituality, which Christians may consider to be particular to Christianity, and not available to dissimilar or distantly foreign belief systems. While particular terms may have some functional translatability to concepts in other systems, such translations may typically be controversial outside of the forum of comparative religion. Because terms interoperate in a closed system, Christians may consider the use of such terms outside of Christianity or their particular branch (or denomination) as a distortion. The term \\"Christianese\\" is an informal and sometimes pejorative reference to the language of terms used in Christianity as contained and, in some cases, deliberately or effectively uncooperative with secular and foreign terms. Certain denominationscontemporary Pentecostalism and Evangelicalism for examplemay be more widely considered as users of distinctly localised variants of Christianese. Some Christian commentators hold that \\"Christianese\\" is incomprehensible or off-putting to outsiders, and suggest that it is possible to express all Christian truth in neutral language, with little or no use of religious words other than \\"God\\", \\"Jesus\\" and \\"Bible\\".  Elements  In its basic form, Christianese uses theological and/or Biblical terms to describe matters of faith and everyday experiences as interpreted through a filter of faith and doctrine. The words and phrases used are known to the speaker of the wider language (e. g. English); however, without an understanding of the passage of Bible, issue of theology or (sometimes) specific doctrine at the forefront of the mind of the speaker, the listener has no context to understand what is being said. For example, a phrase like, \\"Washed in the blood\\" in Christianese means \\"My sins are forgiven because I believe in the terms of salvation as defined by Jesus.\\" However, without an understanding of Jesus, what he did, or what his actions mean in the Christian theology of the speaker, such statements are not understood by the listener or listeners. Sometimes traditional language remains in use down through generations when language usage generally has moved on. For example, \\"Laid aside on a bed of sickness\\" can be used instead of \\"ill\\"; \\"traveling mercies\\" instead of \\"safety on your journey\\". This form of jargon is not fundamentally based in Bible texts but in tradition. Special lexicography There is a standard Christian lexicon within the Catholic Church; given that Catholic terminology is dictated by the authority of the Holy See, there is a great deal more uniformity within its literature. For example, when a non- denominational Protestant refers to the End Times, he or she may be referring to the period following the Incarnation, as Catholics believe, or any number of eschatological interpretations of the Book of Revelation, the Olivet discourse or The Sheep and the Goats. There are other \\"authoritative\\" lexicons within other Christian sects, but these lexicons are considerably less standard. Criticism among Christians Some Christians view some or all of these terms as clichés. The belief that Christianese has hindered the communication of the Christian message to the rest of the world has led some Christian writers to advocate the conscious removal of Christianese from believers' conversations and writing. Many have also come up with alternative terms and phrases that are theoretically more \\"religion-neutral\\". While the effectiveness of this strategy is undetermined, there is a feeling among some Christian communicators that this may be simply creating a condensed form of Christianese but failing to address the underlying issue of contextual understanding. Christianese in popular culture The appearance of Christianese in popular culture generally occurs in two forms: when it is actually used by writers to communicate (whether they are aware of it or not), or in parodical or satirical contexts. Probably the most noticeable use of Christianese as satire is in The Simpsons character of Ned Flanders and his sons Rod and Tod. Though Ned's speaking style is littered with nonsensical phrases (like hi-diddly-ho) which are not related to Christianese, Ned also employs Christianese terms. For example, in the episode where Homer Simpson floods Springfield as a conceptual art project, Ned looks out his window and exclaims: \\"It's a miracle. The Lord has drowned the wicked and spared the righteous!\\". Rod and Tod show a quality of Christianese in the games that they play, such as The Good Samaritan, Clothe the Leper and Build the Mission. Books and movies which engage Christianese as a literary style are commonly found in the Christian market. Arguably the most notable of these (and, indeed, most popular) are the Left Behind series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins. This book series (currently made up of thirteen installments) is deeply rooted in dispensationalist theology and could be said to be written in Christianese (books eleven and twelve perhaps more so than the rest of the series). When the first three installments were adapted into motion pictures by the Christian film company Cloud Ten Pictures, the Christianese style of writing was folded into the dialogue, offering a clear example of Christianese in speech.

The population of Hagerstown city proper at the 2010 census was 39,662, and the population of the Hagerstown-Martinsburg Metropolitan Area (extending into West Virginia) was 269,140. Hagerstown ranks as Maryland's sixth-largest incorporated city. Hagerstown has a distinct topography, formed by stone ridges running from northeast to southwest through the center of town. Geography accordingly bounds its neighborhoods. These ridges consist of upper Stonehenge limestone. Many of the older buildings were built from this stone, which is easily quarried and dressed onsite. It whitens in weathering and the edgewise conglomerate and wavy laminae become distinctly visible, giving a handsome and uniquely “Cumberland Valley” appearance. Several of Hagerstown's churches are constructed of Stonehenge limestone. Its value and beauty as building rock may be seen particularly in St. John's Episcopal Church on West Antietam Street and the Presbyterian Church at the corner of Washington and Prospect Streets. Brick and concrete eventually displaced this native stone in the construction process.Ray Smith Bass, State of Maryland Geological Survey, Cambrian and Ordovician Deposits of Maryland (1919) at 99. Hagerstown anchors the Hagerstown-Martinsburg, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area, which lies just northwest of the Washington- Baltimore-Northern Virginia, DC-MD-VA-WV Combined Statistical Area in the heart of the Great Appalachian Valley. The population of the metropolitan area in 2010 was 269,140. Greater Hagerstown is the fastest-growing metropolitan area in the state of Maryland and among the fastest growing in the United States.Table 7. Cumulative Estimates of Population Change for Metropolitan Statistical Areas and Rankings: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2008 , Census Bureau 2009. Retrieved 26 April 2009. Despite its semi-rural Western Maryland setting, Hagerstown is a center of transit and commerce. Interstates 81 and 70, CSX, Norfolk Southern, and the Winchester and Western railroads, and Hagerstown Regional Airport form an extensive transportation network for the city. Hagerstown is also the chief commercial and industrial hub for a greater Tri-State Area that includes much of Western Maryland as well as significant portions of South Central Pennsylvania and the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. Hagerstown has often been referred to as, and is nicknamed, the Hub City. A person born in Hagerstown is officially called a Hagerstonian. History =Founding= Hager House and Museum in Hagerstown City Park was once home to the city's founder, Jonathan Hager. Burnside's Bridge, a site of heavy combat in the Battle of Antietam, which occurred south of Hagerstown.Hagerstown Public Square circa 1900.In 1739, Jonathan Hager, a German immigrant from Pennsylvania and a volunteer Captain of Scouts, purchased of land in the Great Appalachian Valley between the Blue Ridge and Allegheny Mountains in Maryland and called it Hager's Fancy. In 1762, Hager officially founded the town of Elizabethtown which he named after his wife, Elizabeth Kershner. Fourteen years later, Jonathan Hager became known as the \\"Father of Washington County\\" after his efforts helped Hagerstown become the county seat of newly created Washington County, which Hager also helped create from neighboring Frederick County. The City Council changed the community's name to Hager's-Town in 1813 because the name had gained popular usage, and in the following year, the Maryland State Legislature officially endorsed the changing of the town's name. In 1794, government forces arrested 150 citizens during a draft riot which was staged by protesters in response to the Whiskey Rebellion. =American Civil War= Hagerstown's strategic location at the border between the North and the South made the city a primary staging area and supply center for four major campaigns during the Civil War. In 1861, General Robert Patterson's troops used Hagerstown as a base to attack Virginia troops in the Shenandoah Valley. In the Maryland Campaign of 1862, General James Longstreet's command occupied the town while en route to the Battle of South Mountain and Antietam. In 1863, the city was the site of several military incursions and engagements as Gen. Robert E. Lee's army invaded and retreated in the Gettysburg Campaign. In 1864, Hagerstown was invaded by the Confederate army under Lt. Gen. Jubal Early. On Wednesday, July 6, Early sent 1,500 cavalry, commanded by Brig. Gen. John McCausland, into Hagerstown. The Confederates levied a ransom of $20,000 and a large amount of clothing, in retribution for U.S. destruction of farms, feed and cattle in the Shenandoah Valley. This is in contrast to neighboring Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, which McCausland razed on July 30 when the borough failed to supply the requested ransom of $500,000 in U.S. currency, or $100,000 in gold. Following the war, in 1872 Maryland and Virginia cooperated to re-inter Confederate dead from their impromptu graves to cemeteries in Hagerstown, Frederick and Shepherdstown, West Virginia. Roughly 60% however, remained unidentified. In 1877, 15 years after the Battle of Antietam, also known as the Battle of Sharpsburg, approximately 2,800 Confederate dead from that battle and also from the battles on South Mountain were re-interred in Washington Confederate Cemetery, within Rose Hill Cemetery in Hagerstown.The Crossroads of the Civil War - Hagerstown , Hagerstown-Washington County Convention & Visitor's Bureau, Civil War, Retrieved 2007.Washington Confederate Cemetery, Hagerstown, Maryland, Western Maryland Historical Library, Retrieved 2014. =Railroads= Hagerstown's nickname of the \\"Hub City\\" originated from the large number of railroads (and roads) that served the city. Hagerstown was the center of the Western Maryland Railway and an important city on the Pennsylvania, Norfolk and Western, Baltimore and Ohio, and Hagerstown and Frederick Railroads. Currently, the city is a vital location on CSX, Norfolk Southern, and the Winchester and Western Railroads. Hagerstown was formerly served by the Hagerstown & Frederick Railway, an interurban trolley system, from 1896 to 1947. =Little Heiskell= The weathervane known as \\"Little Heiskell\\", a symbol of the city of Hagerstown, Maryland. One of the most recognizable symbols of Hagerstown is the weathervane known as \\"Little Heiskell\\". Named after the German tinsmith Benjamin Heiskell who crafted it in 1769 in the form of a Hessian soldier, it stood atop the Market House first and City Hall second for a combined 166 years. It was moved from the Market House to City Hall in 1824. During the Civil War era, the weathervane gained its characteristic bullet hole from a Confederate sharpshooter, who won a bet after shooting it from a full city block away. In 1935, the original was retired to the Museum of the Washington County Historical Society, later to be moved to its present display in the Jonathan Hager House. An exact replica has replaced it atop City Hall. The weathervane has been depicted in the city's annual Mummers Day Parade by Charles Harry Rittenhouse, Sr. sporting the necessary accoutrements of a German mercenary soldier. Little Heiskell was at one time the mascot of North Hagerstown High School. =Aviation heritage= Hagerstown's first aircraft production came in World War I with the Maryland Pressed Steel Company building the Bellanca CD biplane in hopes of securing government contracts. From 1931 to 1984, Fairchild Aircraft was based in Hagerstown and was by far the area's most prominent employer. The importance of the company to the city and the country as a whole earned Hagerstown its former nickname \\"Home of the Flying Boxcar\\". Fairchild moved to Hagerstown from Farmingdale, New York, in 1931 after Sherman Fairchild purchased a majority stock interest in Kreider-Reisner Aircraft Company of Hagerstown in 1929. Among Fairchild's products during World War II were PT-19/PT-23/PT-26 (Cornell) and AT-21 trainers, C-82 \\"Packet\\" cargo planes and missiles. At its height in World War II, Fairchild employed directly and indirectly up to 80% of Hagerstown's workforce or roughly 10,000 people. In the postwar era, Fairchild continued to produce aircraft in Hagerstown such as C-123 Provider, Fairchild F-27 and Fairchild Hiller FH-227, FH-1100, C-26 Metroliner, UC-26 Metroliner, Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, and the Fairchild T-46 jet trainer.Hagerstown Regional Airport-Richard A. Henson Field. All production ceased in Hagerstown in 1984 and the company moved elsewhere. Presently, the company is based in San Antonio, Texas and after a series of mergers and acquisitions, is known as M7 Aerospace. The Hagerstown Aviation Museum shows many of these original aircraft. Among the ones on display are: 1939 F24/UC-61C, 1945 C-82A, 1943 PT-19A, and the 1953 C-119.Fairchild Aircraft, Retrieved 2007. The museum is located near Hagerstown Regional Airport in the airport's former terminal. Hagerstown is also the birthplace of Salisbury, Maryland-based Piedmont Airlines which started out as Henson Aviation. It was founded by Richard A. Henson in 1931. Today, Hagerstown Regional Airport- Richard A. Henson Field is named as such in honor of the airlines' founder. Today, only small to medium-sized aviation companies remain in the area, e.g., Sierra Nevada Corporation, a defense electronics engineering and manufacturing contractor. Geography =Location and topography= Hagerstown is located at (39.642771, −77.719954). It is situated south of the Mason–Dixon line and north of the Potomac River and between the Blue Ridge and Allegheny Mountains in a part of the Great Appalachian Valley known regionally as Cumberland Valley and locally as Hagerstown Valley. The community also lies within proximity of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Virginia. Hagerstown, by driving distance, is approximately northwest of Washington, D.C., west-northwest of Baltimore and southwest of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

A railways engineer he spent his early career on several railway construction projects before joining the Great Eastern Railway where his responsibilities included construction of Liverpool Street station. Morgan became chief engineer of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1896 and directed improvements to London Victoria station and Grosvenor Bridge. During the First World War Morgan was a lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Engineers, carrying out \\"special engineering duties\\" in Italy and France for the War Office. He later served as the army's deputy director of railways, on the advisory expert committee to the Ministry of Munitions and on the Disposal Board of the Disposal and Liquidation Commission.  Railway career  Morgan was born on 1 January 1855 in Worcester, England. He was educated privately in Australia and England before commencing a pupillage under Edward Wilson in June 1870. Morgan completed this in 1877 and was employed as a chief engineering assistant in Wilson's firm, Messrs E Wilson & Company on railway engineering works. This included acting as resident engineer during the construction of the Banbury and Cheltenham Railway and as assistant engineer on the construction of several West Midland lines of the Great Western Railway. Morgan was appointed assistant engineer to the Great Eastern Railway in 1883, under chief engineer John Wilson. Morgan had responsibility for maintenance of the entire network including the renewal of a large number of bridges and the company's expansion with new London approach lines, including the construction of the first Liverpool Street station. In 1896 he became chief engineer of the Newhaven Harbour Company, in February of the same year succeeding Frederick Banister as chief engineer of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR;). At LB&SCR; Morgan was responsible for the construction of the line between Stoat's Nest and Earlswood which freed the line from dependence upon the South Eastern Railway and renovation of the company's portion of Victoria station in London. He upgraded the section between Victoria and Balcombe to quadruple track, rebuilding most of the stations along that 32-mile section, and widened the Grosvenor Bridge over the Thames. Morgan retired in 1917 and was appointed to the board of directors, transferring to the board of the Southern Railway after the mergers mandated by the Railways Act 1921.  War work  During the First World War he served in the British Army's Royal Engineers as a Lieutenant-Colonel. Morgan's son also served in the war, as an officer of the Royal Navy. During the war the elder Morgan undertook \\"special engineering duties\\" for the War Office in Italy and France. On 6 April 1917 he was appointed the British Army's Deputy Director of Railways, a position equivalent to appointment as assistant director of supplies and transport in the Army Service Corps, and also served as Commissioner of the Newhaven and Seaford Sea Defences in East Sussex. He was also a member of the Advisory Expert Committee of the Ministry of Munitions. Morgan was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1918. After the war Morgan served as a member of the Disposal Board of the Disposal and Liquidation Commission, a government body formed to dispose of surplus war material, a body he was still a member of (with the rank of colonel) on 29 December 1922 when it was announced that he would receive a knighthood in the New Year Honours. The knighthood was conferred by King George V at Buckingham Palace on 15 February 1923. Morgan was a member of the Territorial Army Engineer and Railway Staff Corps, an unpaid volunteer unit which provides technical expertise to the British Army. He resigned his commission as lieutenant- colonel in this corps on 18 February 1925; he had permission to retain his rank and to continue to wear the uniform.  Personal life  He married Mary Watkins on 14 March 1883 in Redfern, New South Waleshttps://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/13531235 in Australia (to which her parents had immigrated). They had two sons, one also called Charles Langbridge Morgan who became a playwright and novelist, and two daughters. Their grandchildren included Shirley Paget, Marchioness of Anglesey and Roger Morgan. From November 1923 to November 1924 Morgan served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, an organisation he had joined as an associate member on 9 January 1883.. He had been appointed a member on 30 April 1889, served in the institutions council since November 1912 and held the position of vice-president since November 1919.

WordNet Search - 3.0, princeton.edu Traditionally, the discipline of art history emphasized painting, drawing, sculpture, architecture, ceramics, and decorative arts, yet today, art history examines broader aspects of visual culture, including the various visual and conceptual outcomes related to an ever-evolving definition of art. Art history encompasses the study of objects created by different cultures around the world and throughout history that convey meaning, importance, or serve usefulness primarily through visual means. As a discipline, art history is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement; and art theory or \\"philosophy of art\\", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is aesthetics, which includes investigating the enigma of the sublime and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses historical method to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were their teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were their disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and how did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. The current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this inquiry.Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006). Methodologies Art history is an interdisciplinary practice that analyzes the various factors—cultural, political, religious, economic, or artistic—which contribute to visual appearance of a work of art. Art historians employ a number of methods in their research into the ontology and history of objects. Art historians often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and symbolism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created. Art historians also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of line, shape, color, texture, and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a two-dimensional picture plane or the three dimensions of sculptural or architectural space to create their art. The way these individual elements are employed results in representational or non-representational art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is realistic. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational—also called abstract. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. Impressionism is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an \\"impression\\" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of expressionism. An iconographical analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these motifs. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object. Many art historians use critical theory to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from literary scholars, and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. Feminist, Marxist, critical race, queer, and postcolonial theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined. More recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012). Evocative Research in Art History and Beyond: Imagining Possible Pasts in the Ways to Heaven Project, Digital Creativity, 23, 1, pp. 1-21 Timeline of prominent methods =Pliny the Elder and ancient precedents= The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history are the passages in Pliny the Elder's Natural History (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of Greek sculpture and painting.First English Translation retrieved January 25, 2010 From them it is possible to trace the ideas of Xenokrates of Sicyon (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.Dictionary of Art Historians Retrieved January 25, 2010 Pliny's work, while mainly an encyclopaedia of the sciences, has thus been influential from the Renaissance onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter Apelles c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the Six Principles of Painting formulated by Xie He.The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H. Mair, p.51 retrieved January 25, 2010 =Vasari and artists' biographies= Giorgio Vasari, Self- portrait c.1567 Anton von Maron, Portrait of Johann Joachim Winckelmann, 1768 While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see Lorenzo Ghiberti Commentarii, for the best early example),Artnet artist biographies retrieved January 25, 2010 it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, who wrote the first true history of art.website created by Adrienne DeAngelis, currently incomplete, intended to be unabridged, in English. retrieved January 25, 2010 He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was Michelangelo, and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased in places. Vasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe Karel van Mander's Schilder-boeck and Joachim von Sandrart's Teutsche Akademie. Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history. =Winckelmann and art criticism= Scholars such as Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717–1768), criticized Vasari's \\"cult\\" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst, published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome (Fuseli published an English translation in 1765 under the title Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks), and Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums (History of Art in Antiquity), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book)\\". Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of Baroque and Rococo forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober Neoclassicism. Jacob Burckhardt (1818–1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German- speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture. Winckelmann was read avidly by Johann Wolfgang Goethe and Friedrich Schiller, both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the Laocoön group occasioned a response by Lessing. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment in 1790, and was furthered by Hegel's Lectures on Aesthetics. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for Karl Schnaase's work. Schnaase's Niederländische Briefe established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his Geschichte der bildenden Künste, one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by Franz Theodor Kugler. =Wölfflin and stylistic analysis= :See: Formal analysis. Heinrich Wölfflin (1864–1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the \\"father\\" of modern art history. Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including Jakob Rosenberg and Frida Schottmuller. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of Wilhelm Wundt. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their façades looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of style. His book Renaissance and Baroque developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to Giorgio Vasari, Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an \\"art history without names.\\" Finally, he studied art based on ideas of nationhood. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently \\"Italian\\" and an inherently \\"German\\" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist Albrecht Dürer. =Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School= Contemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the University of Vienna. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by Alois Riegl and Franz Wickhoff, both students of Moritz Thausing, and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of late antiquity, which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque. The next generation of professors at Vienna included Max Dvořák, Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and Josef Strzygowski. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including Ernst Gombrich, received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term \\"Second Vienna School\\" (or \\"New Vienna School\\") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including Hans Sedlmayr, Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of Kunstwollen, and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible formalism, and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s. =Panofsky and iconography= Photographer unknown, Aby Warburg c. 1900 Our 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in Hamburg in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were Erwin Panofsky, Aby Warburg, Fritz Saxl and Gertrud Bing. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. \\"Iconography\\"—with roots meaning \\"symbols from writing\\" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources—especially scripture and mythology. \\"Iconology\\" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably. Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the University of Hamburg, where Panofsky taught. Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the Warburg Institute. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the Institute for Advanced Study. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation. =Freud and psychoanalysis= Heinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud wrote a book on the artist Leonardo da Vinci, in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's psyche and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably homosexual. Group photo 1909 in front of Clark University. Front row: Sigmund Freud, Granville Stanley Hall, Carl Jung; back row: Abraham A. Brill, Ernest Jones, Sándor Ferenczi Though the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, Art Across Time, and a book Art and Psychoanalysis. An unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo's Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.Sigmund Freud. The Moses of MIchelangelo The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955. Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari's Lives. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously. =Jung and archetypes= Carl Jung also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. C.G. Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist, an influential thinker, and founder of analytical psychology. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the psyche through exploring the worlds of dreams, art, mythology, world religion and philosophy. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, alchemy, astrology, sociology, as well as literature and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological archetype, the collective unconscious, and his theory of synchronicity. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as coincidence were not merely due to chance but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.In Synchronicity in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon. He argued that a collective unconscious and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American Abstract expressionists in the 1940s and 1950s.Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious. His work inspired the surrealist concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious. Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. Jackson Pollock, for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.Jackson Pollock An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,Archetypes and Alchemy pp. 327-338. The legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyond Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With Griselda Pollock's reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of Julia Kristeva and Bracha L. Ettinger, as with Rosalind Krauss readings of Jacques Lacan and Jean-François Lyotard and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, Feminist theory written in the fields of French feminism and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history. =Marx and ideology= During the mid-20th century, art historians embraced social history by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural (ideology). Marcel Duchamp and Dada Movement jump started the Anti-art style. Various artist did not want to create artwork that everyone was conforming to at the time. These two movements helped other artist to create pieces that were not viewed as traditional art. Some examples of styles that branched off the anti-art movement would be Neo-Dadaism, Surrealism, and Constructivism. These styles and artist did not want to surrender to traditional ways of art. This way of thinking provoked political movements such as the Russian Revolution and the communist ideals.Gayford, Martin (18 February 2017). \\"Exhibitions: Revolution - Russian Art 1917-1932\\". The Spectator. Retrieved 29 October 2018. Artist Isaak Brodsky work of art 'Shock-worker from Dneprstroi' in 1932 shows his political involvement within art. This piece of art can be analysed to show the internal troubles Soviet Russia was experiencing at the time. Perhaps the best-known Marxist was Clement Greenberg, who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay \\"Avant-Garde and Kitsch\\".Clement Greenberg, Art and Culture, Beacon Press, 1961 In the essay Greenberg claimed that the avant- garde arose in order to defend aesthetic standards from the decline of taste involved in consumer society, and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that avant-garde and Modernist art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by capitalist propaganda. Greenberg appropriated the German word 'kitsch' to describe this consumerism, although its connotations have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art. Meyer Schapiro is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, at which time he saw evidence of capitalism emerging and feudalism declining. Arnold Hauser wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled The Social History of Art. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called \\"vulgar Marxism\\". Marxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at UCLA with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. T.J. Clark was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon vulgar Marxism. He wrote Marxist art histories of several impressionist and realist artists, including Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created. =Feminist art history= Linda Nochlin's essay \\"Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?\\" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. This was then followed by a 1972 College Art Association Panel, chaired by Nochlin, entitled \\"Eroticism and the Image of Woman in Nineteenth-Century Art\\". Within a decade, scores of papers, articles, and essays sustained a growing momentum, fueled by the Second-wave feminist movement, of critical discourse surrounding women's interactions with the arts as both artists and subjects. In her pioneering essay, Nochlin applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training, arguing that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields. The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success. Griselda Pollock is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above. While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the feminist art movement, which referred specifically to the experience of women. Often, feminist art history offers a critical \\"re-reading\\" of the Western art canon, such as Carol Duncan's re-interpretation of Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Two pioneers of the field are Mary Garrard and Norma Broude. Their anthologies Feminism and Art History: Questioning the Litany, The Expanding Discourse: Feminism and Art History, and Reclaiming Feminist Agency: Feminist Art History After Postmodernism are substantial efforts to bring feminist perspectives into the discourse of art history. The pair also co-founded the Feminist Art History Conference. =Barthes and semiotics= As opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, semiotics is concerned with how meaning is created. Roland Barthes’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of denoted meaning—the recognition of a visual sign, and the connoted meaning—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31.\\" Semiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a collective consciousness.\\"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128.\\" Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, Meyer Schapiro borrowed Saussure’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.\\"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213.\\" According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a profile, or a three-quarter view. Schapiro combined this method with the work of Charles Sanders Peirce whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the Mona Lisa. By seeing the Mona Lisa, for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or Mona Lisa. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to Leonardo da Vinci? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian's job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.\\"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24.\\" Semiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer's perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it. Rosalind Krauss espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist's monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. Mieke Bal argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.\\"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208.\\" =Museum studies and collecting= Aspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. Museum studies, including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting. =New materialism= Scientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially infra-red and x-ray photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of pigments used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. Dendrochronology for panel paintings and radio-carbon dating for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as illuminated manuscripts and Persian miniatures, and many types of archaeological artworks. Concurrent to those technological advances, art historians have shown increasing interest in new theoretical approaches to the nature of artworks as objects. Thing theory, actor–network theory, and object-oriented ontology have played an increasing role in art historical literature. =Nationalist art history= The making of art, the academic history of art, and the history of art museums are closely intertwined with the rise of nationalism. Art created in the modern era, in fact, has often been an attempt to generate feelings of national superiority or love of one's country. Russian art is an especially good example of this, as the Russian avant-garde and later Soviet art were attempts to define that country's identity. Most art historians working today identify their specialty as the art of a particular culture and time period, and often such cultures are also nations. For example, someone might specialize in the 19th-century German or contemporary Chinese art history. A focus on nationhood has deep roots in the discipline. Indeed, Vasari's Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects is an attempt to show the superiority of Florentine artistic culture, and Heinrich Wölfflin's writings (especially his monograph on Albrecht Dürer) attempt to distinguish Italian from German styles of art. Many of the largest and most well-funded art museums of the world, such as the Louvre, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington are state-owned. Most countries, indeed, have a national gallery, with an explicit mission of preserving the cultural patrimony owned by the government—regardless of what cultures created the art—and an often implicit mission to bolster that country's own cultural heritage. The National Gallery of Art thus showcases art made in the United States, but also owns objects from across the world. Divisions by period The discipline of art history is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in \\"19th-century German architecture\\" or in \\"16th-century Tuscan sculpture.\\" Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient Near East, Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of Ancient art. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus Korean art, for example). Non-Western or global perspectives on art have become increasingly predominant in the art historical canon since the 1980s. \\"Contemporary art history\\" refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of modernism brought by artists of the neo-avant-garde and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on conceptualist and post-conceptualist practices. Professional organizations In the United States, the most important art history organization is the College Art Association.College Art Association It organizes an annual conference and publishes the Art Bulletin and Art Journal. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as architectural history and Renaissance art history. In the UK, for example, the Association of Art Historians is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled Art History.Association of Art Historians Webpage  See also  *Aesthetics *Art criticism *Bildwissenschaft *Fine Arts *History of art *Visual arts and Theosophy *Women in the art history field Notes and references Further reading ;Listed by date *Wölfflin, H.

Many of the buildings date from the early third century AD. Beautiful mosaics decorated the buildings and now most are shown at the Rabat archeological museumBanasa The Latin name Valentia means young, strong and may be compared to Valence (France) and Valencia (Spain), also colonies. Augustus founded at least twelve Roman colonias in Mauretania, although it was a client-kingdom and not yet a province of the empire. Some of the other major Roman companion cities to Iulia Valentia Banasa of this early era are Chellah and Volubilis, the latter of which shares the features of basilica and regular street pattern.

Career as explorer Esch had the academic degree of engineer. From 1929 to 1939 he worked representing a German enterprise in Egypt.Bundesarchiv During this time he made several expeditions into the Libyan Desert and from 1934 to 1935 he accompanied the Hungarian explorer Laszlo Almasy on his motorized expeditions, who called him his \\"navigator\\". In 1934, he led a section of Almásy's expedition in the Gilf Kebir to the Uweinat mountain. Somewhat before, he discovered in Wadi Halfa the Magyarab tribe, which is supposed to be of Hungarian origin. Esch undertook also several expeditions on his own, both by car and by camel train. His interest focussed not only on geographical measurements and cartography, but also on archaeology. North of Wadi Halfa he discovered ancient amethyst mines and interpreted some strange rock carvings nearby and series of ancient stone heaps as traces of the use of a dioptra for geodetics. Howard Carter acknowledged the discoveries but disagreed with Esch's interpretation of early geodetics.Hansjoachim von der Esch: Weenak – die Karawane ruft (Brockhaus 1941) =Later expeditions= Later on, Esch tried to trace the route taken by the Persian king Kambyses during his attempt to conquer the oasis of Siwa. He discovered a series of big stone heaps which he attributed to the Persian army and interpreted the remains of thousands of jars at the \\"pottery hill\\" of Abu Ballas, discovered in 1917, as a water depot for the army. Somewhat later, he tried to explore the zone with a camel train. After a successful test expedition with Senussi nomads, accompanied by the English explorer E. E. Evans-Pritchard, he learned that the British authorities of Egypt, in the wake of growing tensions between the UK and Germany, had issued orders to the Senussi not to put camels at the disposal of foreigners. That put an end to his expeditions in Egypt. In 1941 he published his experiences as an explorer and his archaeological findings and theories in the book Weenak – die Karawane ruft (Leipzig, 1941). The title, a combination of Arabic and German, means, \\"Wherever You Are, The Caravan Calls.\\" He also edited Almásy's books for publication in Germany. Career as ambassador and later life From 1952 to 1957, Esch was the German ambassador in Syria and from 1957 to 1960, he was ambassador in Morocco. He died in 1976. Chafetz expedition From September 1983 to February 1984, Gary S. Chafetz, an American journalist and author, led an expedition—sponsored by Harvard University, The National Geographic Society, the Egyptian Geological Survey and Mining Authority, and the Ligabue Research Institute—that searched for the Lost Army of Cambyses. Chafetz—who is apparently the first person to translate the obscure book by von der Esch—based the location of his search on the six large cairns that von der Esch reported finding in April 1939. Chafetz's six- month search was conducted along the Egyptian-Libyan border in a remote 100-square-kilometer area of complex dunes immediately north northwest of the six von der Esch cairns, south west of the uninhabited Bahrein Oasis, and approximately 100 miles south east of Siwa (Amon) Oasis. The $250,000 expedition had at its disposal 20 Egyptian geologists and laborers, a National Geographic photographer, two Harvard Film Studies documentary filmmakers, three camels, an ultra-light aircraft, and ground-penetrating radar. The expedition discovered approximately 500 tumuli (Zoroastrian-style graves) but no artifacts. Several tumuli contained bone fragments. Thermoluminence later dated these fragments to 1,500 BCE, approximately 1000 years earlier than the Lost Army. A recumbent winged sphinx carved in oolitic limestone was also discovered in a cave in the uninhabited Sitra Oasis (between Bahrein and Siwa Oases), whose provenance appeared to be Persian. Chafetz was arrested when he returned to Cairo in February 1984 for \\"smuggling an airplane into Egypt,\\" even though he had the written permission of the Egyptian Geological Survey and Mining Authority to bring the aircraft into the country. He was interrogated for 24 hours. The charges were dropped after he promised to donate the ultra-light to the Egyptian Government. The aircraft now sits in the Egyptian War Museum in Cairo.

Objects found in these mass graves are now on display within the glass cases located across the floor of the room. The Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights (), previously the Museum of Genocide Victims (), in Vilnius, Lithuania was established in 1992 by order of the Minister of Culture and Education and the President of the Lithuanian Union of Political Prisoners and Deportees. In 1997 it was transferred to the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania. The museum is located in the former KGB headquarters across from the Lukiškės Square; therefore, it is informally referred to as the KGB Museum.\\"KGB Museum\\" The museum is dedicated mostly to collecting and exhibiting documents relating to the 50-year occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union, the anti-Soviet Lithuanian partisans, and the victims of the arrests, deportations, and executions that took place during this period. Before 2018, the museum was known as the Museum of Genocide Victims, reflecting a broadened definition of the term \\"genocide\\" used by the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre.Slate: Double Genocide - Lithuania wants to erase its ugly history of Nazi collaboration—by accusing Jewish partisans who fought the Germans of war crimes. Although these events are considered a genocide only by a few historians, just a small part of the space is devoted to the Holocaust in Lithuania, the event that is universally considered a genocide. In 2018, the museum was thus renamed the Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights. History of the building Cell with padded walls and a straitjacket, for isolation of prisoners declared mentally unstable During the 19th century, Lithuania was part of the Russian Empire. The building, completed in 1890, originally housed the court of the Vilna Governorate. The German Empire used it during its World War I occupation of the country. After independence was declared, it served as a conscription center for the newly formed Lithuanian army and as the Vilnius commander's headquarters. During the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, the city was briefly taken by the Bolsheviks, and the building housed commissariats and a revolutionary tribunal. Following Żeligowski's Mutiny of 1920, Vilnius and its surroundings were incorporated into Poland, and the building housed the courts of justice for the Wilno Voivodship. Lithuania was invaded by the Soviet Union in 1940, and following an ultimatum, became a Soviet Socialist Republic. Mass arrests and deportations followed, and the building's basement became a prison. In 1941 Nazi Germany invaded the country; the building then housed the Gestapo headquarters. Inscriptions on the cell walls from this era remain. The Soviets retook the country in 1944, and from then until independence was re- established in 1991, the building was used by the KGB, housing offices, a prison, and an interrogation center. Over 1,000 prisoners were executed in the basement between 1944 and the early 1960s, about one-third for resisting the occupation. Most bodies were buried in the Tuskulėnai Manor, which underwent reconstruction and hosts a branch of the museum. In addition to housing the museum, the building now serves as a courthouse and as the repository of the Lithuanian Special Archives. Collections Wall outside the museum, engraved with names of those killed inside The non-violent aspect of the resistance is represented by various books, underground publications, documents, and photographs. The collection pertaining to the Forest Brothers' armed resistance includes documents and photographs of the partisans. A section devoted to the victims of deportations, arrests, and executions holds photographs, documents, and personal belongings; this collection is continually expanded by donations from the public, seeing the museum as the best means of preserving the materials.  Controversy  No exposition devoted to the Holocaust in Lithuania existed in the Museum of Genocide Victims until 2011, despite the fact that more Jews were killed in Lithuania than in Germany, both in relative and absolute numbers, and that only a few historians believe Soviet repression against the Lithuanians constituted a genocide. To address international criticism, a small exposition describing the Holocaust in Lithuania was added in 2011. In April 2018, after a piece by Rod Nordland in The New York Times quoted Dovid Katz as saying the museum was \\"a 21st-century version of Holocaust denial\\", the museum changed its name to the Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights. As of 2020, the museum \\"focuses almost entirely on the murder of the Lithuanian non-Jewish population, while perpetrators of the Holocaust are lauded as victims in their countries’ struggle against Soviet occupation.\\" Footnotes References * Official website * Official website - History of the building * Official website - The former execution camera * Official website - Collections Museums in Vilnius 1992 establishments in Lithuania History museums in Lithuania Decommunization ","title":"Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights"},{"id":"21208102","text":"Leucania uda is a moth of the family Noctuidae.

Since the 1980s, his songs have been popular in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. His songs are written mostly in Chinese, with a few in English. The lyrics often reflect traditional Chinese thought, combined with a contemporary mentality. In 1978, Hou Dejian wrote a song entitled \\"Descendants of the Dragon\\", with which he gained significant popularity. He left Taiwan for mainland China in 1983, despite the ban for the visit from the Republic of China government on Taiwan. He then witnessed and became a part of the hunger strike with three others in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 pro-democracy movement in Beijing. They have been called 'Four men of honour' (四君子). June 2 hunger strike declaration On June 2 Liu Xiaobo, Zhou Duo, and Gao Xin joined Hou Dejian in Tiananmen Square to announce their hunger strike in support of the student movement.Zhang Liang, The Tiananmen Papers. eds Perry Link and Andrew J. Nathan. New York Public Affairs, 2001. p. 362. A popular singer in China, Hou Dejian stated \\"music played a very important role during the movement.

Cries for democracy: Writings and speeches from the 1989 Chinese democracy movement. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. p. 353 The hope of the declaration was to create a transformation in government that would be rooted in democratic principles, rather than the authoritarian model in place. While the construction of the declaration was a means of encouraging the student movement, it also criticized the students for failing to follow the democratic principles they claimed to value. This announcement from Hou Dejian and the others troubled high-ranking officials within the party, playing a definitive role in the government's decision on June 3 to approve a violent crackdown. Role in evacuating the square on June 4 Amidst the chaos in the morning of June 4 the four men decided that they had to take responsibility for the students in the square.Cheng, Eddie. 2009. Standoff at Tiananmen. Highlands Ranch, Colorado, Sensys Corporation, 2009. p. 262 Although Zhou Duo had volunteered to go out to seek the cooperation of the soldiers, he realised that Hou Dejian was the only person that the soldiers might know of. Together, Hou and the others met with a political commissar and said, \\"We volunteer to take all the students out of the square and ask the PLA not to open fire. Please give us enough time to organise an evacuation.\\"Zhang, p. 380 After the government accepted Hou's request, Hou and Zhou Duo rushed to the monument to announce that the command post had agreed to the evacuation of the square.Zhang, p. 381 The crowd of students was initially reluctant to leave the square. However, with the help of Feng Congde, Hou Dejian and the student leaders were able to usher the students away.Cheng, p. 265 But he was disappointed about the PLA opening fire on the crowds in the other areas. Life as a dissident After the 1989 events at Tiananmen, Hou Dejian disappeared from the public eye to avoid the crackdown on so called \\"counterrevolutionaries\\" who had participated in the protest. While rumors swirled of his whereabouts, Hou spent 72 days under the protection of the Australian embassy. Following his emergence out of hiding, Hou gave an interview to media discussing his role in the evacuation of the square. He stated: \\"During the whole withdrawal process I didn\`t see a single student, either citizen or soldier killed in the square. Nor did I see any armored personnel carriers rolling over people.\\" One of the first activists who appeared to be taking the governments side, Hou was aware that his interview would cause outrage among the people of China, and he was correct.Jaivin, Linda. The Monkey and the Dragon. Melbourne: Text Publishing Company, 2001. p. 329 Although the news release was clearly \\"slanted\\" in order to illustrate that no one had been killed in the clearing of the squareJaivin, p. 330 he questioned the people who thought he was lying about his story. Hou asked: \\"are we going to use lies to attack an enemy who lies? Aren't facts powerful enough? To tell lies against our enemy's lies only satisfies our need to vent our anger, but it's a dangerous thing to do.\\"\\"Ending\\" The Gate of Heavenly Peace. Long Bow Group. Accessed April 10, 2014 Through interviews with foreign media, Hou took a much more critical approach of the government. According to the Wall Street Journal, among the 1.1 billion people in China in 1990, Hou Dejian was the only individual to utter \\"in public the criticisms of the state that many Chinese share[d] but dare not speak.\\" Andrew Higgins, a Beijing correspondent for the Independent, a British daily, stated that Hou was \\"the only real interview in town.\\" China initially accepted his opposition, giving the impression that those who challenged the state would not face consequences. However, on June 1, 1990, Hou, along with Gao Xin and Zhou Duo, cancelled a news conference in which they intended to speak up against the government. According to Linda Jaivin, the news conference was intended to reaffirm Hou and the others’ \\"commitment to the principles of rationality, tolerance, and non-violence.\\"Jaivin, p. 355 It also acted as a petition for the release of Liu Xiaobo and other so called black hands that took part in the 1989 protests. When reporters arrived at Hou's home, they found a written message stating that he had cancelled the conference due to personal matters. Prior to the news conference the three dissidents were detained, forcing Hou Dejian to negotiate the terms of their release with authorities. When the government promised not to detain the three dissidents, Hou agreed to be deported to Taiwan.MacFarquhar, Roderick. The Politics of China: Sixty Years of the People's Republic of China. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011. p. 458n415. After his deportation Hou moved to New Zealand and began writing books and screenplays. Later career In 2011, Hou surprisingly resurfaced in Beijing to perform in a concert.Tiananmen Protestor Switches Sides?, 2011. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuh_C6vKyTA. In an interview that year, Hou stated, \\"Human rights in China are not what I am most concerned about now\\". In 2018 Hou wrote the tune for a song called Chinese Dream (), with lyrics by Jiang Kairu (蒋开儒), which was performed for the first time at a ceremony at Zhengding High School in Hebei. The song refers to the concept of the Chinese Dream promoted by Xi Jinping, current General Secretary of the Communist Party of China.

The term also applies beyond Europe to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to Europe by immigration, colonization, or influence. For example, Western culture includes countries in the Americas, such as Canada or the United States, and Oceania, such as Australia or New Zealand, whose language and demographic ethnicity majorities are of European descent without indigenous influence. Western culture is most strongly influenced by the Greco-Roman and Christian cultures. Ancient Greece is considered the birthplace of many elements of Western culture, including the development of a democratic system of government and major advances in philosophy, science and mathematics. The expansion of Greek culture into the Hellenistic world of the eastern Mediterranean led to a synthesis between Greek and Near-Eastern cultures, and major advances in literature, engineering, and science, and provided the culture for the expansion of early Christianity and the Greek New Testament. This period overlapped with and was followed by Rome, which made key contributions in law, government, engineering and political organization. The concept of a \\"West\\" dates back to the Roman Empire, where there was a cultural divide between the Greek East and Latin West, a divide that later continued in Medieval Europe between the Catholic Latin Church west and the \\"Greek\\" Eastern Orthodox east. Western culture is characterized by a host of artistic, philosophic, literary and legal themes and traditions.

A cornerstone of Western thought, beginning in ancient Greece and continuing through the Middle Ages and Renaissance, is the idea of rationalism in various spheres of life developed by Hellenistic philosophy, scholasticism and humanism. Empiricism later gave rise to the scientific method, the scientific revolution, and the Age of Enlightenment. Western culture continued to develop with the Christianisation of European society during the Middle Ages, the reforms triggered by the Renaissance of the 12th century and 13th century under the influence of the Islamic world via Al-Andalus and Sicily (including the transfer of technology from the East, and Latin translations of Arabic texts on science and philosophy), and the Italian Renaissance as Greek scholars fleeing the fall of the Byzantine Empire after the Muslim conquest of Constantinople brought classical traditions and philosophy.Geanakoplos, Deno John.

European culture developed with a complex range of philosophy, medieval scholasticism, mysticism and Christian and secular humanism.Sailen Debnath, 2010, \\"Secularism: Western and Indian,\\" New Delhi, India:Atlantic Publishers & Distributors, . Rational thinking developed through a long age of change and formation, with the experiments of the Enlightenment and breakthroughs in the sciences. Tendencies that have come to define modern Western societies include the concept of political pluralism, individualism, prominent subcultures or countercultures (such as New Age movements) and increasing cultural syncretism resulting from globalization and human migration.  Terminology  Post-1990 Huntington's major civilizations (Western is colored dark blue). The West as a geographical area is unclear and undefined. More often the ideology of a state's inhabitants is what will be used to categorize it as a Western society. There is some disagreement about what nations should or should not be included in the category and at what times. Many parts of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire are considered Western today but were considered Eastern in the past. However, in the past it was also the Eastern Roman Empire that had many features now seen as \\"Western,\\" preserving Roman law, which was first codified by Justinian in the east, as well as the traditions of scholarship around Plato, Aristotle, and Euclid that were later introduced to Italy during the Renaissance by Greek scholars fleeing the fall of Constantinople. Thus, the culture identified with East and West itself interchanges with time and place (from the ancient world to the modern). Geographically, the \\"West\\" of today would include Europe (especially the states that collectively form the European Union, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Switzerland) together with extra-European territories belonging to the English-speaking world, the Hispanidad, the Lusosphere; and the Francophonie in the wider context. Since the context is highly biased and context-dependent, there is no agreed definition of what the \\"West\\" is. It is difficult to determine which individuals fit into which category and the East–West contrast is sometimes criticized as relativistic and arbitrary.Yin Cheong Cheng, New Paradigm for Re-engineering Education. p. 369Ainslie Thomas Embree, Carol Gluck, Asia in Western and World History: A Guide for Teaching. p. xviKwang-Sae Lee, East and West: Fusion of Horizons Globalism has spread Western ideas so widely that almost all modern cultures are, to some extent, influenced by aspects of Western culture. Stereotyped views of \\"the West\\" have been labeled Occidentalism, paralleling Orientalism—the term for the 19th-century stereotyped views of \\"the East\\". As Europeans discovered the wider world, old concepts adapted. The area that had formerly been considered the Orient (\\"the East\\") became the Near East as the interests of the European powers interfered with Meiji Japan and Qing China for the first time in the 19th century. Thus the Sino-Japanese War in 1894–1895 occurred in the Far East while the troubles surrounding the decline of the Ottoman Empire simultaneously occurred in the Near East. The term Middle East in the mid-19th century included the territory east of the Ottoman Empire, but West of China—Greater Persia and Greater India—is now used synonymously with \\"Near East\\" in most languages.  History  Evolutionary flow chart of Eastern Hemisphere Civilizations, extracted from Samuel P. Huntington's 1996 Clash of Civilizations and based on Carroll Quigley's The Evolution of Civilizations: An Introduction to Historical Analysis. The earliest civilizations which influenced the development of Western culture were those of Mesopotamia; the area of the Tigris–Euphrates river system, largely corresponding to modern-day Iraq, northeastern Syria, southeastern Turkey and southwestern Iran: the cradle of civilization.Jacobus Bronowski; The Ascent of Man; Angus & Robertson, 1973 Geoffrey Blainey; A Very Short History of the World; Penguin Books, 2004 Ancient Egypt similarly had a strong influence on Western culture. The Greeks contrasted themselves with both their Eastern neighbours (such as the Trojans in Iliad) as well as their Western neighbours (who they considered barbarians). Concepts of what is the West arose out of legacies of the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire. Later, ideas of the West were formed by the concepts of Latin Christendom and the Holy Roman Empire. What is thought of as Western thought today originates primarily from Greco-Roman and Germanic influences, and includes the ideals of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the Enlightenment, as well as Christian culture. = Classical West = Alexander the Great While the concept of a \\"West\\" did not exist until the emergence of the Roman Republic, the roots of the concept can be traced back to Ancient Greece. Since Homeric literature (the Trojan Wars), through the accounts of the Persian Wars of Greeks against Persians by Herodotus, and right up until the time of Alexander the Great, there was a paradigm of a contrast between Greeks and other civilizations. Greeks felt they were the most civilized and saw themselves (in the formulation of Aristotle) as something between the advanced civilizations of the Near East (who they viewed as soft and slavish) and the wild barbarians of most of Europe to the west. During this period writers like Herodotus and Xenophon would highlight the importance of freedom in the Ancient Greek world, as opposed to the perceived slavery of the so called barbaric world. Alexander's conquests led to the emergence of a Hellenistic civilization, representing a synthesis of Greek and Near-Eastern cultures in the Eastern Mediterranean region.Green, Peter. Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990. The Near-Eastern civilizations of Ancient Egypt and the Levant, which came under Greek rule, became part of the Hellenistic world. The most important Hellenistic centre of learning was Ptolemaic Egypt, which attracted Greek, Egyptian, Jewish, Persian, Phoenician and even Indian scholars.George G. Joseph (2000). The Crest of the Peacock, p. 7-8. Princeton University Press. . Hellenistic science, philosophy, architecture, literature and art later provided a foundation embraced and built upon by the Roman Empire as it swept up Europe and the Mediterranean world, including the Hellenistic world in its conquests in the 1st century BCE. Following the Roman conquest of the Hellenistic world, the concept of a \\"West\\" arose, as there was a cultural divide between the Greek East and Latin West. The Latin-speaking Western Roman Empire consisted of Western Europe and Northwest Africa, while the Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire (later the Byzantine Empire) consisted of the Balkans, Asia Minor, Egypt and Levant. The \\"Greek\\" East was generally wealthier and more advanced than the \\"Latin\\" West. With the exception of Italia, the wealthiest provinces of the Roman Empire were in the East, particularly Roman Egypt which was the wealthiest Roman province outside of Italia.Maddison, Angus (2007), Contours of the World Economy, 1–2030 AD: Essays in Macro-Economic History, p. 55, table 1.14, Oxford University Press, Nevertheless, the Celts in the West created some significant literature in the ancient world whenever they were given the opportunity (an example being the poet Caecilius Statius), and they developed a large amount of scientific knowledge themselves (as seen in their Coligny Calendar). Representation of Jesus of Nazareth, central figure of Christianity. The Maison Carrée in Nîmes, one of the best-preserved Roman temples. It is a mid-sized Augustan provincial temple of the theocratic Imperial cult of the Empire. The Imperial cult was inseparable from that of Rome's official deities, whose cult was essential to Rome's survival and whose neglect was therefore treasonous. Traditional cult was a focus of Imperial revivalist legislation under Decius and Diocletian. The Roman Empire at its greatest extent. For about five hundred years, the Roman Empire maintained the Greek East and consolidated a Latin West, but an East–West division remained, reflected in many cultural norms of the two areas, including language. Eventually, the empire became increasingly split into a Western and Eastern part, reviving old ideas of a contrast between an advanced East, and a rugged West. In the Roman world, one could speak of three main directions: North (Celtic tribal states and Parthians), the East (lux ex oriente), and finally the South (Quid novi ex Africa?), the latter conquered after the Punic Wars. From the time of Alexander the Great (the Hellenistic period), Greek civilization came in contact with Jewish civilization. Christianity would eventually emerge from the syncretism of Hellenic culture, Roman culture, and Second Temple Judaism, gradually spreading across the Roman Empire and eclipsing its antecedents and influences.Gordon, Cyrus H., The Common Background of the Greek and Hebrew Civilasations, W. W. Norton and Company, New York 1965 The rise of Christianity reshaped much of the Greco- Roman tradition and culture; the Christianised culture would be the basis for the development of Western civilization after the fall of Rome (which resulted from increasing pressure from barbarians outside Roman culture). Roman culture also mixed with Celtic, Germanic, and Slavic cultures, which slowly became integrated into Western culture: starting mainly with their acceptance of Christianity. = Medieval West = Mosaic of Justinian I with his court, circa 547–549, Basilica of San Vitale (Ravenna, Italy) St. Martin's cathedral in Spišské Podhradie (Slovakia) and the Spiš Castle behind the cathedral Stone bas-relief of Jesus, from the Vézelay Abbey (Burgundy, France) Notre- Dame, the most iconic Gothic cathedral, built between 1163 and 1345 The Medieval West referred specifically to the Catholic \\"Latin\\" West, also called \\"Frankish\\" during Charlemagne's reign, in contrast to the Orthodox East, where Greek remained the language of the Byzantine Empire. After the fall of Rome, much of Greco-Roman art, literature, science and even technology were all but lost in the western part of the old empire. However, this would become the centre of a new West. Europe fell into political anarchy, with many warring kingdoms and principalities. Under the Frankish kings, it eventually, and partially, reunified, and the anarchy evolved into feudalism. Much of the basis of the post-Roman cultural world had been set before the fall of the Empire, mainly through the integration and reshaping of Roman ideas through Christian thought. The Greek and Roman paganism had been completely replaced by Christianity around the 4th and 5th centuries, since it became the official State religion following the baptism of emperor Constantine I. Orthodox Christian Christianity and the Nicene Creed served as a unifying force in Christian parts of Europe, and in some respects replaced or competed with the secular authorities. The Jewish Christian tradition out of which it had emerged was all but extinguished, and antisemitism became increasingly entrenched or even integral to Christendom. Art and literature, law, education, and politics were preserved in the teachings of the Church, in an environment that, otherwise, would have probably seen their loss. The Church founded many cathedrals, universities, monasteries and seminaries, some of which continue to exist today. After the fall of the Roman Empire, many of the classical Greek texts were translated into Arabic and preserved in the medieval Islamic world. The Greek classics along with Arabic science, philosophy and technology were transmitted to Western Europe and translated into Latin, sparking the Renaissance of the 12th century and 13th century.George Sarton: A Guide to the History of Science Waltham Mass. U.S.A. 1952Burnett, Charles. \\"The Coherence of the Arabic-Latin Translation Program in Toledo in the Twelfth Century,\\" Science in Context, 14 (2001): 249–288. Thomas Aquinas, a Catholic philosopher of the Middle Ages, revived and developed natural law from ancient Greek philosophy Medieval Christianity is credited with creating the first modern universities. The Catholic Church established a hospital system in Medieval Europe that vastly improved upon the Roman valetudinaria and Greek healing temples. These hospitals were established to cater to \\"particular social groups marginalized by poverty, sickness, and age,\\" according to historian of hospitals, Guenter Risse. Christianity played a role in ending practices common among pagan societies, such as human sacrifice, slavery, infanticide and polygamy. Francisco de Vitoria, a disciple of Thomas Aquinas and a Catholic thinker who studied the issue regarding the human rights of colonized natives, is recognized by the United Nations as a father of international law, and now also by historians of economics and democracy as a leading light for the West's democracy and rapid economic development. Joseph Schumpeter, an economist of the twentieth century, referring to the Scholastics, wrote, \\"it is they who come nearer than does any other group to having been the 'founders' of scientific economics.\\" In a broader sense, the Middle Ages, with its fertile encounter between Greek philosophical reasoning and Levantine monotheism was not confined to the West but also stretched into the old East. The philosophy and science of Classical Greece was largely forgotten in Europe after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, other than in isolated monastic enclaves (notably in Ireland, which had become Christian but was never conquered by Rome).\\"How The Irish Saved Civilisation\\", by Thomas Cahill, 1995 The learning of Classical Antiquity was better preserved in the Byzantine Eastern Roman Empire. Justinian's Corpus Juris Civilis Roman civil law code was created in the East in his capital of Constantinople, and that city maintained trade and intermittent political control over outposts such as Venice in the West for centuries. Classical Greek learning was also subsumed, preserved and elaborated in the rising Eastern world, which gradually supplanted Roman-Byzantine control as a dominant cultural-political force. Thus, much of the learning of classical antiquity was slowly reintroduced to European civilization in the centuries following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. The rediscovery of the Justinian Code in Western Europe early in the 10th century rekindled a passion for the discipline of law, which crossed many of the re-forming boundaries between East and West. In the Catholic or Frankish west, Roman law became the foundation on which all legal concepts and systems were based. Its influence is found in all Western legal systems, although in different manners and to different extents. The study of canon law, the legal system of the Catholic Church, fused with that of Roman law to form the basis of the refounding of Western legal scholarship. During the Reformation and Enlightenment, the ideas of civil rights, equality before the law, procedural justice, and democracy as the ideal form of society began to be institutionalized as principles forming the basis of modern Western culture, particularly in Protestant regions. In the 14th century, starting from Italy and then spreading throughout Europe,Burke, P., The European Renaissance: Centre and Peripheries (1998) there was a massive artistic, architectural, scientific and philosophical revival, as a result of the Christian revival of Greek philosophy, and the long Christian medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities.Grant God and Reason p. 9 This period is commonly referred to as the Renaissance. In the following century, this process was further enhanced by an exodus of Greek Christian priests and scholars to Italian cities such as Venice after the end of the Byzantine Empire with the fall of Constantinople. discovery of the New World by Christopher Columbus. From Late Antiquity, through the Middle Ages, and onwards, while Eastern Europe was shaped by the Orthodox Church, Southern and Central Europe were increasingly stabilized by the Catholic Church which, as Roman imperial governance faded from view, was the only consistent force in Western Europe. In 1054 came the Great Schism that, following the Greek East and Latin West divide, separated Europe into religious and cultural regions present to this day. Until the Age of Enlightenment, Christian culture took over as the predominant force in Western civilization, guiding the course of philosophy, art, and science for many years. Movements in art and philosophy, such as the Humanist movement of the Renaissance and the Scholastic movement of the High Middle Ages, were motivated by a drive to connect Catholicism with Greek and Arab thought imported by Christian pilgrims. However, due to the division in Western Christianity caused by the Protestant Reformation and the Enlightenment, religious influence—especially the temporal power of the Pope—began to wane. From the late 15th century to the 17th century, Western culture began to spread to other parts of the world through explorers and missionaries during the Age of Discovery, and by imperialists from the 17th century to the early 20th century. During the Great Divergence, a term coined by Samuel Huntington the Western world overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the most powerful and wealthy world civilization of the time, eclipsing Qing China, Mughal India, Tokugawa Japan, and the Ottoman Empire. The process was accompanied and reinforced by the Age of Discovery and continued into the modern period. Scholars have proposed a wide variety of theories to explain why the Great Divergence happened, including lack of government intervention, geography, colonialism, and customary traditions. = Early modern era = The United States Constitution Coming into the modern era, the historical understanding of the East–West contrast—as the opposition of Christendom to its geographical neighbors—began to weaken. As religion became less important, and Europeans came into increasing contact with far away peoples, the old concept of Western culture began a slow evolution towards what it is today. The Age of Discovery faded into the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century, during which cultural and intellectual forces in European society emphasized reason, analysis, and individualism rather than traditional lines of authority. It challenged the authority of institutions that were deeply rooted in society, such as the Catholic Church; there was much talk of ways to reform society with toleration, science and skepticism. Philosophers of the Enlightenment included Francis Bacon, René Descartes, John Locke, Baruch Spinoza, Voltaire (1694–1778), David Hume, and Immanuel Kant.Sootin, Harry. \\"Isaac Newton.\\" New York, Messner (1955) influenced society by publishing widely read works. Upon learning about enlightened views, some rulers met with intellectuals and tried to apply their reforms, such as allowing for toleration, or accepting multiple religions, in what became known as enlightened absolutism. New ideas and beliefs spread around Europe and were fostered by an increase in literacy due to a departure from solely religious texts. Publications include Encyclopédie (1751–72) that was edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. The Dictionnaire philosophique (Philosophical Dictionary, 1764) and Letters on the English (1733) written by Voltaire spread the ideals of the Enlightenment. Coinciding with the Age of Enlightenment was the scientific revolution, spearheaded by Newton. This included the emergence of modern science, during which developments in mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology (including human anatomy) and chemistry transformed views of society and nature.Galileo Galilei, Two New Sciences, trans. Stillman Drake, (Madison: Univ. of Wisconsin Pr., 1974), pp. 217, 225, 296–97.Marshall Clagett, The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages, (Madison, Univ. of Wisconsin Pr., 1961), pp. 218–19, 252–55, 346, 409–16, 547, 576–78, 673–82; Anneliese Maier, \\"Galileo and the Scholastic Theory of Impetus,\\" pp. 103–23 in On the Threshold of Exact Science: Selected Writings of Anneliese Maier on Late Medieval Natural Philosophy, (Philadelphia: Univ. of Pennsylvania Pr., 1982).Hannam, p. 342E.

While its dates are disputed, the publication in 1543 of Nicolaus Copernicus's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres) is often cited as marking the beginning of the scientific revolution, and its completion is attributed to the \\"grand synthesis\\" of Newton's 1687 Principia. =Industrial Revolution= The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840. This included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, and the development of machine tools. These transitions began in Great Britain, and spread to Western Europe and North America within a few decades. A Watt steam engine. The steam engine, made of iron and fueled primarily by coal, propelled the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain and the world.Watt steam engine File: located in the lobby of into the Superior Technical School of Industrial Engineers of the UPM (Madrid) The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. Some economists say that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population began to increase consistently for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries. The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians, as is the pace of economic and social changes.Eric Hobsbawm, The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848, Weidenfeld & Nicolson Ltd., p. 27 GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy, while the Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies. Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals, plants and fire. The First Industrial Revolution evolved into the Second Industrial Revolution in the transition years between 1840 and 1870, when technological and economic progress continued with the increasing adoption of steam transport (steam-powered railways, boats, and ships), the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the increasing use of machinery in steam- powered factories. No name is given to the transition years. The \\"Transportation Revolution\\" began with improved roads in the late 18th century.. Reprinted by McGraw-Hill, New York and London, 1926 (); and by Lindsay Publications, Inc., Bradley, Illinois, (). =Post-Industrial Revolution= Tendencies that have come to define modern Western societies include the concept of political pluralism, individualism, prominent subcultures or countercultures (such as New Age movements) and increasing cultural syncretism resulting from globalization and human migration. Western culture has been heavily influenced by the Renaissance, the Ages of Discovery and Enlightenment and the Industrial and Scientific Revolutions. In the 20th century, Christianity declined in influence in many Western countries, mostly in the European Union where some member states have experienced falling church attendance and membership in recent years, and also elsewhere. Secularism (separating religion from politics and science) increased. Christianity remains the dominant religion in the Western world, where 70% are Christians. The West went through a series of great cultural and social changes between 1945 and 1980. The emergent mass media (film, radio, television and recorded music) created a global culture that could ignore national frontiers. Literacy became almost universal, encouraging the growth of books, magazines and newspapers. The influence of cinema and radio remained, while televisions became near essentials in every home. By the mid-20th century, Western culture was exported worldwide, and the development and growth of international transport and telecommunication (such as transatlantic cable and the radiotelephone) played a decisive role in modern globalization. The West has contributed a great many technological, political, philosophical, artistic and religious aspects to modern international culture: having been a crucible of Catholicism, Protestantism, democracy, industrialisation; the first major civilisation to seek to abolish slavery during the 19th century, the first to enfranchise women (beginning in Australasia at the end of the 19th century) and the first to put to use such technologies as steam, electric and nuclear power. The West invented cinema, television, the personal computer and the Internet; produced artists such as Michelangelo, Shakespeare, Rembrandt, Bach, and Mozart; developed sports such as soccer, cricket, golf, tennis, rugby, basketball, and volleyball; and transported humans to an astronomical object for the first time with the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon Landing.  Arts and humanities  Detail of the thumb What is distinctive of European art is that it comments on so many levels-religious, humanistic, satirical, metaphysical, and the purely physical. Some cultural and artistic modalities are characteristically Western in origin and form. While dance, music, visual art, story-telling, and architecture are human universals, they are expressed in the West in certain characteristic ways. European art pays deep tribute to human suffering. In Western dance, music, plays and other arts, the performers are only very infrequently masked. There are essentially no taboos against depicting a god, or other religious figures, in a representational fashion. = Music = In music, Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern Western musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church,Hall, p. 100. and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The Baroque style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.Murray, p. 45. The symphony, concerto, sonata, opera, and oratorio have their origins in Italy. Many musical instruments developed in the West have come to see widespread use all over the world; among them are the violin, piano, pipe organ, saxophone, trombone, clarinet, accordion, and the theremin. In turn, most European instruments have roots in earlier Eastern instruments that were adopted from the medieval Islamic world. The solo piano, symphony orchestra, and the string quartet are also significant musical innovations of the West.

Depictions of the nude human male and female in photography, painting, and sculpture are frequently considered to have special artistic merit. Realistic portraiture is especially valued. Photography, and the motion picture as both a technology and basis for entirely new art forms were also developed in the West. File:Cubiculum (bedroom) from the Villa of P.

The polka, the square dance, the flamenco, and the Irish step dance are very well known Western forms of folk dance. Greek and Roman theatre are considered the antecedents of modern theatre, and forms such as medieval theatre, passion plays, morality plays, and commedia dell'arte are considered highly influential. Elizabethan theatre, with such luminaries as William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, and Ben Jonson, is considered one of the most formative and important eras for modern drama. The soap opera, a popular culture dramatic form, originated in the United States first on radio in the 1930s, then a couple of decades later on television. The music video was also developed in the West in the middle of the 20th century. Musical theatre was developed in the West in the 19th and 20th Centuries, from music hall, comic opera, and Vaudeville; with significant contributions from the Jewish diaspora, African-Americans, and other marginalized peoples. = Literature = The Divine Comedy is an epic poem by Dante Alighieri. Engraving by Gustave Doré While epic literary works in verse such as the Mahabharata and Homer's Iliad are ancient and occurred worldwide, the prose novel as a distinct form of storytelling, with developed, consistent human characters and, typically, some connected overall plot (although both of these characteristics have sometimes been modified and played with in later times), was popularized by the WestBarzun, p. 380 in the 17th and 18th centuries. Of course, extended prose fiction had existed much earlier; both novels of adventure and romance in the Hellenistic world and in Heian Japan. Both Petronius' Satyricon (c. 60 CE) and the Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu (c. 1000 CE) have been cited as the world's first major novel but they had a very limited long-term impact on literary writing beyond their own day until much more recent times. The novel, which made its appearance in the 18th century, is an essentially European creation. Chinese and Japanese literature contain some works that may be thought of as novels, but only the European novel is couched in terms of a personal analysis of personal dilemmas. As in its artistic tradition, European literature pays deep tribute to human suffering. Tragedy, from its ritually and mythologically inspired Greek origins to modern forms where struggle and downfall are often rooted in psychological or social, rather than mythical, motives, is also widely considered a specifically European creation and can be seen as a forerunner of some aspects of both the novel and of classical opera. The validity of reason was postulated in both Christian philosophy and the Greco-Roman classics. Christianity laid a stress on the inward aspects of actions and on motives, notions that were foreign to the ancient world. This subjectivity, which grew out of the Christian belief that man could achieve a personal union with God, resisted all challenges and made itself the fulcrum on which all literary exposition turned, including the 20th-21st century novels. = Architecture = Important Western architectural motifs include the Doric, Corinthian, and Ionic columns, and the Romanesque, Gothic, Baroque, and Victorian styles are still widely recognised, and used even today, in the West. Much of Western architecture emphasizes repetition of simple motifs, straight lines and expansive, undecorated planes. A modern ubiquitous architectural form that emphasizes this characteristic is the skyscraper, their modern equivalent first developed in New York and Chicago. The predecessor of the skyscraper can be found in the medieval towers erected in Bologna.

Iron and steel ships, bridges and skyscrapers first appeared in the West. Nitrogen fixation and petrochemicals were invented by Westerners. Most of the elements were discovered and named in the West, as well as the contemporary atomic theories to explain them. The transistor, integrated circuit, memory chip, and computer were all first seen in the West. The ship's chronometer, the screw propeller, the locomotive, bicycle, automobile, and airplane were all invented in the West. Eyeglasses, the telescope, the microscope and electron microscope, all the varieties of chromatography, protein and DNA sequencing, computerised tomography, nuclear magnetic resonance, x-rays, and light, ultraviolet and infrared spectroscopy, were all first developed and applied in Western laboratories, hospitals and factories. In medicine, the pure antibiotics were created in the West. The method of preventing Rh disease, the treatment of diabetes, and the germ theory of disease were discovered by Westerners. The eradication of smallpox, was led by a Westerner, Donald Henderson. Radiography, computed tomography, positron emission tomography and medical ultrasonography are important diagnostic tools developed in the West. Other important diagnostic tools of clinical chemistry, including the methods of spectrophotometry, electrophoresis and immunoassay, were first devised by Westerners. So were the stethoscope, the electrocardiograph, and the endoscope. Vitamins, hormonal contraception, hormones, insulin, beta blockers and ACE inhibitors, along with a host of other medically proven drugs, were first utilized to treat disease in the West. The double-blind study and evidence-based medicine are critical scientific techniques widely used in the West for medical purposes. In mathematics, calculus, statistics, logic, vectors, tensors and complex analysis, group theory and topology were developed by Westerners.* Elwes, Richard, \\"An enormous theorem: the classification of finite simple groups,\\" Plus Magazine, Issue 41, December 2006.Richard Swineshead (1498), Calculationes Suiseth Anglici, Papie: Per Franciscum Gyrardengum.Dodge, Y.

Archimedes, Method, in The Works of Archimedes In biology, evolution, chromosomes, DNA, genetics and the methods of molecular biology are creations of the West. In physics, the science of mechanics and quantum mechanics, relativity, thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics were all developed by Westerners. The discoveries and inventions by Westerners in electromagnetism include Coulomb's law (1785), the first battery (1800), the unity of electricity and magnetism (1820), Biot–Savart law (1820), Ohm's Law (1827), and Maxwell's equations (1871). The atom, nucleus, electron, neutron and proton were all unveiled by Westerners. The world's most widely adopted system of measurement, the International System of Units, derived from the metric system, was first developed in France and evolved through contributions from various Westerners. In business, economics, and finance, double entry bookkeeping, credit cards, and the charge card were all first used in the West.(Chapters 9, 10, 11, 13, 25 and 26) and three times (Chapters 4, 8 and 19) in its sequel, Equality Westerners are also known for their explorations of the globe and outer space. The first expedition to circumnavigate the Earth (1522) was by Westerners, as well as the first journey to the South Pole (1911), and the first Moon landing (1969). The landing of robots on Mars (2004 and 2012) and on an asteroid (2001), the Voyager 2 explorations of the outer planets (Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989), Voyager 1s passage into interstellar space (2013), and New Horizons flyby of Pluto (2015) were significant recent Western achievements.  Media  The roots of modern-day Western mass media can be traced back to the late 15th century, when printing presses began to operate throughout wealthy European cities. The emergence of news media in the 17th century has to be seen in close connection with the spread of the printing press, from which the publishing press derives its name.: In the 16th century, a decrease in the preeminence of Latin in its literary use, along with the impact of economic change, the \\"discoveries\\" arising from trade and travel, navigation to the \\"new\\" world, science and arts and the development of increasingly rapid communications through print led to a rising corpus of vernacular media content in European society. After the launch of the satellite Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union in 1957, satellite transmission technology was dramatically realised, with the United States launching Telstar in 1962 linking live media broadcasts from the UK to the US. The first digital broadcast satellite (DBS) system began transmitting in US in 1975. Beginning in the 1990s, the Internet has contributed to a tremendous increase in the accessibility of Western media content. Departing from media offered in bundled content packages (magazines, CDs, television and radio slots), the Internet has primarily offered unbundled content items (articles, audio and video files).  Religion  The native religions of Europe were polytheistic but not homogenous – however, they were similar insofar as they were predominantly Indo-European in origin. Roman religion was similar to but not the same as Hellenic religion – likewise for indigenous Germanic polytheism, Celtic polytheism and Slavic polytheism. Before this time many Europeans from the north, especially Scandinavians, remained polytheistic, though southern Europe was predominantly Christian from the 5th century onwards. Western culture is most strongly influenced by the Judeo-Christian and Greco-Roman cultures. These cultures had a number of similarities, such as a common emphasis on the individual, but they also embody fundamentally conflicting worldviews. For example, in Judaism and Christianity, God is the ultimate authority, while Greco-Roman tradition considers the ultimate authority to be reason. Christian attempts to reconcile these frameworks were responsible for the preservation of Greek philosophy. As in other areas, the Jewish diaspora and Judaism exist in the Western world. Non-European groups, and Jews in particular, have been subjected to intense racism, ethnic and religious hatred, xenophobia, discrimination, and persecution in the West. This has included pogroms, forced conversion, displacement, segregation and ghettos, ethnic cleansing, genocide, and other forms of violence and prejudice. Religion has waned in Europe, where people who are agnostic or atheist make up about 18% of the European population today. In particular, over half of the populations of the Czech Republic (79% of the population was agnostic, atheist or irreligious), the United Kingdom (~25%), Germany (25–33%), France (30–35%)Views on globalisation and faith . Ipsos MORI, 5 July 2011. Catholicisme et protestantisme en France: Analyses sociologiques et données de l'Institut CSA pour La Croix – Groupe CSA TMO for La Croix, 2001 and the Netherlands (39–44%) are agnostic or atheist. However, per another survey by Pew Research Center from 2011, Christianity remains the dominant religion in the Western world where 70–84% are Christians, According to this survey, 76% of Europeans described themselves as Christians, and about 86% of the Americas population identified themselves as Christians, (90% in Latin America and 77% in North America). And 73% in Oceania are self-identify as Christian, and 76% in South Africa is Christian. According to new polls about religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer, Christianity is the largest religion in the European Union, accounting for 72% of the EU population. The question asked was \\"Do you consider yourself to be...?\\" With a card showing: Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Other Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Buddhist, Hindu, Atheist, and Non-believer/Agnostic. Space was given for Other (SPONTANEOUS) and DK. Jewish, Sikh, Buddhist, Hindu did not reach the 1% threshold. Catholics are the largest Christian group, accounting for 48% of the EU citizens, while Protestants make up 12%, Eastern Orthodox make up 8% and other Christians make up 4%. Non-believers/Agnostics account for 16%, atheists account for 7%, and Muslims account for 2%. Throughout the Western world there are increasing numbers of people who seek to revive the indigenous religions of their European ancestors; such groups include Germanic, Roman, Hellenic, Celtic, Slavic, and polytheistic reconstructionist movements. Likewise, Wicca, New Age spirituality and other neo-pagan belief systems enjoy notable minority support in Western states.  Sport  The Bull-Leaping Fresco from the Great Palace at Knossos, Crete. Sport has been an important part of Western cultural expression since Classical Antiquity. Baron Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the International Olympic Committee, and considered father of the modern Olympic Games. Since classical antiquity, sport has been an important facet of Western cultural expression. A wide range of sports was already established by the time of Ancient Greece and the military culture and the development of sports in Greece influenced one another considerably. Sports became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the Peloponnesus called Olympia. Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a Frenchman, instigated the modern revival of the Olympic movement. The first modern Olympic games were held at Athens in 1896. The Romans built immense structures such as the amphitheatres to house their festivals of sport. The Romans exhibited a passion for blood sports, such as the infamous Gladiatorial battles that pitted contestants against one another in a fight to the death. The Olympic Games revived many of the sports of Classical Antiquity—such as Greco-Roman wrestling, discus and javelin. The sport of bullfighting is a traditional spectacle of Spain, Portugal, southern France, and some Latin American countries. It traces its roots to prehistoric bull worship and sacrifice and is often linked to Rome, where many human-versus-animal events were held. Bullfighting spread from Spain to its American colonies, and in the 19th century to France, where it developed into a distinctive form in its own right. Jousting and hunting were popular sports in the European Middle Ages, and the aristocratic classes developed passions for leisure activities. A great number of popular global sports were first developed or codified in Europe. The modern game of golf originated in Scotland, where the first written record of golf is James II's banning of the game in 1457, as an unwelcome distraction to learning archery. The Industrial Revolution that began in Britain in the 18th Century brought increased leisure time, leading to more time for citizens to attend and follow spectator sports, greater participation in athletic activities, and increased accessibility. These trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communication. The bat and ball sport of cricket was first played in England during the 16th century and was exported around the globe via the British Empire. A number of popular modern sports were devised or codified in Britain during the 19th Century and obtained global prominence—these include ping pong, modern tennis, association football, netball and rugby. Football(also known as soccer) remains hugely popular in Europe, but has grown from its origins to be known as the world game. Similarly, sports such as cricket, rugby, and netball were exported around the world, particularly among countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, thus India and Australia are among the strongest cricketing states, while victory in the Rugby World Cup has been shared among New Zealand, Australia, England, and South Africa. Australian Rules Football, an Australian variation of football with similarities to Gaelic football and rugby evolved in the British colony of Victoria in the mid-19th century. The United States also developed unique variations of English sports. English migrants took antecedents of baseball to America during the colonial period. The history of American football can be traced to early versions of rugby football and association football. Many games are known as \\"football\\" were being played at colleges and universities in the United States in the first half of the 19th century. American football resulted from several major divergences from rugby, most notably the rule changes instituted by Walter Camp, the \\"Father of American Football\\". Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith, a Canadian physical education instructor working in Springfield, Massachusetts in the United States. Volleyball was created in Holyoke, Massachusetts, a city directly north of Springfield, in 1895.  Themes and traditions  A Madonna and Child painting by an anonymous Italian from the first half of the 19th century, oil on canvas. Western culture has developed many themes and traditions, the most significant of which are: * Greco-Roman classic letters, arts, architecture, philosophical and cultural tradition, which include the influence of preeminent authors and philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Homer, Virgil, and Cicero, as well as a long mythologic tradition. * Christian ethical, philosophical, and mythological tradition, stemming largely from the Christian Bible, particularly the New Testament Gospels. * Monasteries, schools, libraries, books, book making, universities, teaching, education, and lecture halls. * A tradition of the importance of the rule of law. * Secular humanism, rationalism and Enlightenment thought. This set the basis for a new critical attitude and open questioning of religion, favouring freethinking and questioning of the church as an authority, which resulted in open-minded and reformist ideals inside, such as liberation theology, which partly adopted these currents, and secular and political tendencies such as laicism, agnosticism and atheism. * Generalized usage of some form of the Latin or Greek alphabet, and derived forms, such as Cyrillic, used by those southern and eastern Slavic countries of Christian Orthodox tradition, historically under the Byzantine Empire and later within the Russian czarist or the Soviet area of influence. Other variants of the Latin or Greek alphabets are found in the Gothic and Coptic alphabets, which historically superseded older scripts, such as runes, and the Egyptian Demotic and Hieroglyphic systems. * Natural law, human rights, constitutionalism, parliamentarism (or presidentialism) and formal liberal democracy in recent times—prior to the 19th century, most Western governments were still monarchies. * A large influence, in modern times, of many of the ideals and values developed and inherited from Romanticism. * An emphasis on, and use of, science as a means of understanding the natural world and humanity's place in it. * More pronounced use and application of innovation and scientific developments, as well as a more rational approach to scientific progress (what has been known as the scientific method), as opposed to more empiric discoveries in the Eastern world.
