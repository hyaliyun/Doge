He played in Major League Baseball for the Oakland Athletics in 2011 and 2012 and he played for the Musashi Heat Bears in Japan's Baseball Challenge League. Professional career Chicago White Sox (2006–2008) De Los Santos began his career in the Chicago White Sox organization as a starting pitcher. He played well in the Dominican Summer League in 2006. In 2007, he split time between Single-A Kannapolis and Advanced-A Winston-Salem. Oakland Athletics (2008–2012) In January 2008, he was traded along with Ryan Sweeney and Gio González to the Athletics for Nick Swisher. In 2008, he pitched for Single-A Stockton, but was out for much of the 2008 and 2009 seasons after undergoing Tommy John surgery to repair an injured elbow. He finished 2009 with the AZL Athletics and was added to the Athletics' 40-man roster after the season ended.A's Add Four To 40-Man Roster De Los Santos began 2010 back with the Stockton Ports and was promoted to the Double-A Midland RockHounds where he spent most of the season. Despite finishing 2010 with a disappointing 6.54 ERA in 25 appearances with Midland, De Los Santos performed well in 2011 and quickly climbed the ranks. He was promoted to the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats on May 5. On May 20, after just 6 innings pitched in 5 appearances in Triple-A, De Los Santos received his first major-league call-up to the Athletics when Brandon McCarthy and Tyson Ross were placed on the disabled list. However, since both injured pitchers were in the team's starting rotation, De Los Santos was sent back down again four days later without having made an appearance to make room for the promotion of a starter, Guillermo Moscoso. On June 3, De Los Santos was again called up to the Athletics when Grant Balfour, another reliever, was placed on paternity leave. In his major-league debut on June 4, De Los Santos faced one batter, the Red Sox's Jed Lowrie, and struck him out. In his second appearance, though, De Los Santos gave up a hit and then two wild pitches in the same at bat, allowing a run in one inning. In an unexpected move, the Athletics decided to keep De Los Santos with the team when Balfour returned from leave, because their bullpen had been depleted in the previous night's 14-inning game, designating backup infielder Andy LaRoche for assignment instead. Milwaukee Brewers (2012) On July 28, 2012, De Los Santos was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for catcher George Kottaras. San Diego Padres (2013) On February 6, 2013, De Los Santos was claimed off waivers by the San Diego Padres. Later that year, he was one of 20 players named in connection to Biogenesis of America, who allegedly gave performance-enhancing drugs to professional players. On August 5, 2013, he agreed to a 50-game suspension for his role in the scandal while in Arizona recovering from right shoulder surgery.\\"MLB suspensions for 12, reports say\\". espn.go.com.

Howard Mather Burnham (March 17, 1842 – September 19, 1863), is best known for having fought and died at the Battle of Chickamauga in Georgia, during the American Civil War. Early life Burnham attended a military high school in Hamden, Connecticut and upon graduation he attended Sanborn's school in Concord, Massachusetts and Lawrence scientific school (now known as Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Soon after the Massachusetts Volunteers were attacked in Baltimore, Maryland, he enlisted in the Springfield City Guards on April 19, 1861. Military career Burnham was sent to the 10th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry and received a commission as a Second Lieutenant in command of the Fifth Artillery in the regular Union Army. He served impatiently for several months as a Union Army recruiting officer in Towanda, Philadelphia, New York, and Dubuque until he was ordered to Fort Hamilton in New York on garrison duty. He went to Washington, DC for an assignment as Aide-de-camp to his uncle Major General Joseph K. Mansfield, commander of the XII Corp of the Army of the Potomac, but before he had the chance to join his staff Gen. Mansfield was killed at the Battle of Antietam. After several months he was promoted to First Lieutenant and joined the 5th U.S. Light Artillery, Battery H of the Army of the Cumberland under General William Rosecrans. Shortly after taking command of Battery H, he had been appointed Chief of Artillery of the 1st division, 14th army corps and placed on the staff of Gen. Absalom Baird. Battle of Chickamauga On the morning of September 19, 1863, Burnham was overseeing his artillery battery in the thick woods near Jay's Mill at the Battle of Chickamauga. With Confederate troops charging his position, he attempted to bring his horses forward to haul off the guns, but alert Confederates shot the animals as soon as they were within sight. With no chance of escape, he ordered his gunners to load their four 12-pound Napoleons with double-shotted canister. Battery H opened up as soon as the 18th Infantry skirmishers were clear, causing the Confederates to take cover. The 16th Infantrymen in front of the guns occupied a slightly lower elevation and saw the shells flying over their heads. But Battery H did not have much infantry support and enemy fire quickly shot down their gunners. Burnham was shot in the chest, mortally wounded. When his second in command, Lt. Joshua A. Fessenden, asked Burnham if he was hurt, he responded: \\"Not much, but save the guns!\\". Lt. Fessenden had the following to say about the battle that day: > During the morning, after an all night march, we were ordered forward by > General King. The battery was hardly in position before the troops on the > right gave way and it was exposed to a most terrific fire of musketry from > front and flank. General King ordered us to limber to the rear, but it was > impossible to execute the order, since many of the cannoneers were either > killed or wounded, and the horses shot at the limbers. At the first fire, > Lieut. Burnham fell mortally wounded; Lieut. Ludlow was also wounded and > fell into the enemy's hands, and myself slightly wounded in the side. The > battery was taken by the enemy, after firing sixteen rounds of canister. Lt. Fessenden had himself been shot in the hip, but he assumed command. Battery H was overrun but Lt. Fessenden successfully rallied his troops, recaptured his artillery, and even took one gun of the Confederates. Lt. Fessenden kept the field and brought off the pieces but without their caissons as these had to be abandoned through lack of horses. While the battle ranged on Burnham survived for another two hours. In addition to Burnham, 42 men in his unit were either killed or wounded and more than one-third of the horses were shot that day. Gen. John King dispatched the following in his report: > I take this occasion to speak in the highest terms of the officers of > Battery H, 5th Artillery, 1st Lieut. H. M. Burnham and 2d Lieutenants Israel > Ludlow and J. A. Fessenden. The officers of this battery, finding it > impossible to retire, remained with their pieces, firing, until they were > forcibly taken from them by the enemy.

There has been speculation about the authorship of the work. Some scholars believe it was written by Hume's friend, the economist Adam Smith. Most believe it was written by Hume himself, in an attempt to popularise the Treatise. In The Philosophical Quarterly in 1976, and again in Hume Studies 1991, J. O. Nelson challenged the received view that Hume wrote the Abstract, arguing that Adam Smith wrote it. His case depends on the identity of the 'Mr Smith' referred to in a letter of 4 March, 1740 from Hume at Ninewells to Francis Hutcheson at Glasgow. :My Bookseller has sent to Mr Smith a Copy of my Book, which I hope he has receiv‘d, as well as your Letter. I have not yet heard what he has done with the Abstract. Perhaps you have.

Keynes and Sraffa argued that the \\"Mr Smith\\" was John Smith, Hutcheson’s Dublin publisher, and that Hume wrote the Abstract (as all the internal evidence suggests). Norman Kemp Smith, in a review of the Keynes and Sraffa edition, also accepted this, as well as pointing out the entry on Hume in Watkins Biographical Dictionary attributing authorship of the Abstract to Hume, suggesting that the author of the entry possessed inside information about Hume’s motives in publishing the Abstract. Nelson has argued that \\"Mr Smith\\" was Adam Smith (at that time, still a student). David Raynor has argued that all of the presently available internal and external evidence suggests that Hume wrote the Abstract. References *R.W.Connon, M.

Life The son of Daniel Shea, a farmer, he was born in County Limerick. He entered Trinity College, Dublin on 3 June 1793, and in 1797 obtained a scholarship in classics. Several of his friends belonged to the Society of United Irishmen. In April 1798 John FitzGibbon, 1st Earl of Clare, vice-chancellor of the university, held a visitation, at which he required students to take an oath that they would inform against anybody whom they knew to be connected with the society. Shea, refusing to comply, was expelled from the university. He came to England, and found a mastership in a private school. His knowledge of Italian gained him the post of chief clerk in a large mercantile establishment at Malta. While there he mastered Arabic, acquiring a knowledge not only of the classical language, but also of current dialects. A project on the part of his employers to open a factory on the east coast of the Black Sea induced him to study Persian also. But the firm being compelled to withdraw from the Levant altogether, he was recalled to England. He made the acquaintance of Adam Clarke, who found him employment as a private tutor in the house of Dr. Laurell, and afterwards by his interest procured him an assistant professorship in the oriental department of the East India Company's Haileybury College. On the institution of the Oriental Translation Fund, Shea was made a member of committee, and started by translating Mirkhond's ‘History of the Early Kings of Persia,’ which was published in London in 1832. He moved on to the translation of the Dabistán. Before finishing however, he died at Haileybury College on 11 May 1836. The translation of the Dabistán was completed by Anthony Troyer, and published in Paris in 1843, and in London in 1844.

It was compiled by John Watkins, LL.D., and published by Longman, Rees Orme, Brown and Green. Entry on Hume The dictionary is notable for its entry on the philosopher David Hume, which notes that \\"he published [the Treatise] in London in 1738, but its reception not answering his expectations, he printed a small analysis of it, in a sixpenny pamphlet, to make it sell\\". Because the pamphlet (An Abstract of the Treatise of Human Nature) was published anonymously, it is not known how the author of the article came by this information. Norman Kemp Smith has speculated that the firm of Longman's, who published both Watkin's Dictionary, and volume III of the A Treatise of Human Nature, was the channel through which the tradition of Hume's authorship of the Abstract was preserved.Norman Kemp Smith, Mind 1938 Notes References *Biography: writing lives By Catherine Neal Parke * \\"New Books\\", Norman Kemp Smith, Mind 1938 XLVII(188):522-524, * An Abstract of a Book lately Published; Entitled, A Treatise of Human Nature, &c.; Wherein the Chief Argument of that Book is farther Illustrated and Explained, (London, 1740). * \\"The Authorship of the Abstract Revisited\\" David Raynor, Hume Studies, Volume XIX, Number 1 (April, 1993) 213-215 .

In a bid to keep up with growing demand, the two distilleries eventually became one in the early twentieth century. In 1955 the distillery was taken over by new proprietors led by Joseph Hobbs. Under Hobbs, the distillery began using continuous distillation, installing a Coffey Still which remained on the site for 26 years and made the distillery one of the first to produce both malt and grain whisky simultaneously. The Japanese company Nikka (Japan) acquired the distillery in 1989. The heart of the range has been for some time the 10 years old. There have also been a few cask-finishes, limited editions and independent bottlings, notably from Blackadder and Douglas Laing. In 1991, a visitor centre and cafe was opened for the public.

Second marriage and children On September 23, 1824, Perry married her second husband, James Franklin Perry. Emily and James Franklin Perry had six children: *Stephen Samuel Perry (Born June 24, 1825 in Potosi, Missouri; died September 5, 1874 in Brazoria, Texas). *Emily Rosanna Perry (Born September 24, 1826 in Potosi, Missouri; died December 6, 1827 in Potosi, Missouri). *Eliza Margaret Perry (Born January 3, 1828 in Potosi, Missouri; died January 3, 1862 in Austin, Texas). *James Elijah Brown Perry (Born May 17, 1830 in Potosi, Missouri; died February 14, 1831 in Chocolate Bayou, Texas). *Henry Austin Perry (Born November 17, 1831 at Chocolate Bayou, Texas; died September 10, 1853 in Biloxi, Mississippi). *Cecilia Perry (Born December 10, 1835 at Peach Point Plantation; died June 8, 1836 at Peach Point Plantation). Of her eleven total children, six would live to adulthood. On June 7, 1831, the family, composed of Emily and James Perry, four Bryan children, and Stephen Perry, began the long move from Potosi, Missouri, to Texas. First year in Texas: San Felipe de Austin and Chocolate Bayou Emily and most of her family (including Samuel Stephen and Eliza Margaret) arrived at San Felipe de Austin, Texas, on August 14, 1831. Her son, Moses Austin Bryan, had arrived in Texas some months before his parents, on January 2, 1831. Emily and the younger children remained in San Felipe de Austin for several months, and then the family lived for about one year on the Chocolate Bayou producing sugar and cotton.http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hnc54 Remaining years in Texas: Peach Point Plantation Perry, her husband, and her children settled in Jones Creek, Texas, in present day Brazoria County, Texas and developed Peach Point Plantation also known as \\"Peach Point\\"; she lived at Peach Point until she died in 1851. Rutherford B. Hayes Perry interacted with Rutherford B. Hayes during his visit to Peach Point Plantation in 1848. Hayes wrote in a letter that Perry was, \\"an excellent motherly sort of woman, whose happiness consists in making others happy.\\"The Trip to Texas p. 248 http://www.ohiohistory.org/onlinedoc/hayes/chapteriv.html Hayes also wrote in a letter to his mother that, \\"instead of having the care of one family, [Emily] is the nurse, physician, and spiritual adviser of a whole settlement of careless slaves. She feels it is her duty to see to their comfort when sick or hurt.\\"The Trip to Texas, January 1, 1849, (p. 255) http://www.ohiohistory.org/onlinedoc/hayes/chapteriv.html . Some historians argue that Perry's relatively/comparatively favorable treatment of slaves can be generalized to other holders of the time period, while others question whether this generalization is reasonable. Though they may not themselves have known when they met, Perry was also, via shared descent from Anthony Austin and Esther Huggins, a third cousin once removed of U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes. Sole heir to Stephen F. Austin Perry was the sole heir to Stephen Fuller Austin following his death.Cantrell, Gregg (2001), Stephen F. Austin: Empresario of Texas, p. 381, Yale University Press, Half the estate went to her immediately and half the \\"entire estate reverted to Emily\\" in 1837 upon the death of Brown Austin's eight-year-old son, who happened to be named Stephen F. Austin, Jr. Everything was bequeathed not in James Perry's name and not to her sons, but to Perry, a woman, in 1836. Transferred by bequest, all of Stephen F. Austin's possessions, property and land became Perry's separate property, and not community property. In fact, Perry was meticulous to ensure the Austin estate proceeds, books, and operations were not commingled, thus maintaining their legal characterization as her separate property, rather than community property with her husband (even though her husband, James F. Perry, was executor of Austin's estate). Wealth Accordingly, Perry was one of the largest Texas individual landholders and irrefutably the wealthiest woman in Texas. She was actively involved in management of the Austin estate, including investments and land, actively involved in a time where male signatures were still required on contracts and women could not vote. Support of land planning, railroads, and industry Perry was very involved in the urban planning and settling land. For example, she was one of the founders of the San Luis Company, which managed the development of San Luis, including the initial sale of 450 lots, development of streets, building a bridge, and construction of a lighthouse. Perry raised capital and invested in the first attempt to build a railroad in Texas: The Brazos and Galveston Railroad Company, chartered by the Congress of the Republic of Texas, on May 24, 1838.http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hva33 The rail was initially to go from Galveston Bay to the Brazos River, and later plans were for the rail to go from San Luis Island instead of Galveston Bay.\\"Railroad Enterprise in Texas, 1836–1841,\\" Southwestern Historical Quarterly 47 (April 1944). She was the largest shareholder of the first railroad company in Texas. Perry was at the helm of the development and planning of San Luis. Perry not only owned the league of land which contained Dollar Point, she also managed the development of the town of Austinia, located within that league. Austinia is known in the present day as Texas City. Perry loaned money to Gail Borden (as in the founder/pioneer of Borden Milk Products) to buy his first herd of cows. Support of religion Perry played a key role in founding the first Episcopal Church in Texas. In 1848, she donated to a visitor to Peach Point, Episcopal Bishop George Washington Freeman of Arkansas, in order to help launch the Episcopal Diocese of Texas. In addition, she paid to underwrite Leonidas Polk's trip to Texas from Louisiana. Polk was the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana and later served as a General in the American Civil War, ultimately having Fort Polk named in his honor. Perry also donated the land on which the Union Church Building was originally built; this one structure served as a prayer center for Methodists, the Episcopalians, and the Presbyterians.http://www.brazoriafumc.org/fumcstory.html Support of education Perry paid Thomas J. Pilgrim to teach her children;http://www.cemetery.state.tx.us/pub/user_form.asp?pers_id=401 Pilgrim started the all-boys school, Austin Academy, in 1829, which was the first school in Texas. Austin Academy had about 40 students. Perry deeded of land for the support and founding of Austin College. In addition, she directed monies owed by the State of Texas to the Austin estate to Austin College. Perry agreed to support her family friend and Austin College Founder Reverend Daniel Baker (who had been Pastor of the Washington, DC Presbyterian church attended by Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams); she supported Baker in his pursuit of expanding religious foundations and education in Texas. Geographic names Perry's children and their progeny also played important roles in Texas history and the development of the State. The surnames of Emily's first husband, James Bryan, and her second husband, James Perry, are each geographic names in Texas. For example, Bryan, Texas is the location of Texas A&M; University; Perry's Landinghttp://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hvpcwhttp://texas.hometownlocator.com/tx/brazoria/perry- landing.cfmhttp://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utcah/00543/cah-00543.html is located in Brazoria County. James and Emily Austin Perry Papers Professor of History, Light Townsend Cummins, of Austin College, the official Historian of the State of Texas at the time of this writing, points out that despite her important participation in and contributions to Texas history, there is no collection of letters archived under Emily's name; rather, the collection archived in the 1930s was titled for her husband and son, \\"the James F. and Stephen S. Perry Papers.\\" Cummins, who has reviewed the papers housed at the Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin, notes that this collection includes \\"as much of Emily's letters, documents, and papers as those of her husband and son.\\" Cummins points out that the archive was named in the 1930s, and were they named under archiving standards in 2009, they would very likely instead have been called, \\"The James and Emily Austin Perry Papers.\\" Death Perry is buried at Gulf Prairie Cemetery at the site of the present day historical marker in her honor, and beside her brother, Stephen F.

Mr. Phillips, of the Methodist Episcopal church.\\" Historical marker In 1986, as part of the Texas Sesquicentennial, an historical marker was commissioned in recognition of Perry's contribution to Texas history.http://www.texas-settlement.org/markers/brazoria/78.html Austin- Bryan-Perry family reunion Each year, descendants of the Austin, Bryan, and Perry families from across the country gather in Jones Creek for reunion in celebration of Perry's life and her birthday. The Daughters of the Republic of Texas, Volume 1, states that on her birthday more than 200 met to \\"rise up and call her blessed\\", (applying to Perry the language from the poem, Eishes Chayil (אשת חיל), \\"A Woman of Valor\\",Proverbs 31:28 with which King Solomon concludes the Book of Proverbs). Stephen F. Austin, himself, had no children.

Once called Center Station it was a stop along the New York Central Railroad (NYCRR) that became famous for being the site where the Karner Blue butterfly was first identified. History Karner started as Center Station along the New York Central Railroad's (NYCRR) tracks. The station was built in 1831. George Karner in the mid-to-late 19th century bought the land that would become the hamlet and laid out streets and lots, though most did not sell. Center was renamed Karner in 1880 for him. Though development never made Karner important the lack of development did save the Plebejus melissa samuelis, or Karner Blue butterfly. The common name of the butterfly is named after the hamlet because it was here that Vladimir Nabokov first identified the species and used the specimens located in the Albany Pine Bush as the type specimen for the identification of the entire species. Geography Karner is centered along Karner Road with the CSXT/Amtrak tracks between Albany and Schenectady passing through the center of the hamlet. Along the western edge of Karner is the New Karner Road, New York Route 155. The edges surrounding the core of the hamlet are rural pine barrens with much of the land protected in the Pine Bush Preserve.

St. Louis Centre opened in 1985, with anchor stores Famous-Barr at one end and Dillard's at the other. The anchor location of Famous-Barr was the company's flagship outlet and also contained that company's corporate offices, and the corporate headquarters of the May Company. The Dillard's location was once the flagship, and headquarters of Stix, Baer and Fuller, with that chain being sold to Dillard's just as mall construction commenced. The mall was initially popular and featured national chain stores. As the 1990s progressed, the mall faced challenges with the redevelopment of the former Westroads Shopping Center into the St. Louis Galleria. By the mid-1990s, Dillard's converted its location into one of its clearance stores, and no longer carried regular day-to-day merchandise, this location closed for good in 2001. In 2006, the almost-vacant \\"dead mall\\" closed, and was bought by The Pyramid Companies and was planned to be turned into condominiums and retail space, though the plan was never realized, as Pyramid closed in 2008 due to financial troubles. The mall was foreclosed in 2009 by lender Bank of America and later bought for $12.7 million by Environmental Operations. In 2009, the building was about 85% vacant, and other developers were trying to raise funding for a renovation of the mall. Plans included a $35 million renovation, turning much of the complex into parking space, as well as a $29 million project to attract tenants to the center's office tower. The project, led by investor Stacy Hastie, includes plans for local law firm Lewis, Rice & Fingersh and accounting firm LarsonAllen LLP to move into the building. Earlier, the Missouri Development Finance Board had approved a $5 million loan for the project. In May 2010, work began to convert part of the building into a 750-car parking garage and retail/entertainment complex called Mercantile Exchange. The skybridges to the Famous-Barr Railway Exchange Building (St. Louis) and the former Stix, Baer and Fuller / Dillard's store (now referred to as The Laurel Building) have now been demolished to open up Washington and Locust streets.

She also floated around studios doing bit-parts, usually at Warner Bros. or Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer, variusly as a blues singer, waitress, tribal woman, prostitute, and hat check girl. Harris had a featured role as a friend of star Jean Harlow in MGM's Hold Your Man (1932), co-starring Clark Gable. In 1933, she appeared as Chico in the Warner Bros. pre-Code production of Baby Face, starring Barbara Stanwyck. That same year, Harris starred in a substantial role opposite Ginger Rogers in Professional Sweetheart. As Rogers' character's maid, Harris' character subs for Rogers' character as a singer on the radio. Despite the fact that Harris' character was a major point for the story's plot development, she was uncredited for the role.Slide 2012 p.203 Throughout the 1930s, Harris played many uncredited parts in films such as Horse Feathers (1932), Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933), Mary Stevens, M.D. (1933) and Morning Glory (1933).

In 1937, she appeared in the race film Bargain with Bullets opposite Ralph Cooper for Million Dollar Productions, co-owned by Cooper. While doing promotion for the film, Harris spoke about her frustration over the difficulty African American actors faced in the film industry stating, > I never had the chance to rise about the role of maid in Hollywood movies. > My color was against me anyway you looked at it. The fact that I was not > \\"hot\\" stamped me either as uppity or relegated me to the eternal role of > stooge or servant. [...] My ambition is to be an actress. Hollywood had no > parts for me. She also praised Ralph Cooper for starting a production company that produced films starring African American actors. She said, > We have nothing to lose in the development of an all-colored motion picture > company. The competition will make Hollywood perk up and produce better > films with our people in a variety of roles. Harris continued to lobby for better parts within Hollywood but found few opportunities. In the 1939 movie, \\"Tell No Tales\\" she was credited for playing Ruby, the wife of a murdered man. Harris played an emotional scene with Melvin Douglas at the funeral. She appears in a small but vivid role as Kathie Moffat's ex-maid Eunice Leonard in Jacques Tourneur 1947 Out of the Past.

It is a remake of the 1934 Austrian film A Precocious Girl which had been made by the German subsidiary of the company Deutsche Universal. This film is now in the public domain due to failure to renew copyright after 27 years. Plot Carrie is the 20-year-old daughter of Chris. Chris has a new boyfriend, Steve Forbes. Carrie pretends to be 12 years old so Steve won't think Chris is too old. Steve's colleague Jimmy spends time with Carrie.

In January 1942 Universal announced that it would be produced and directed by Henry Koster; Koster had directed most of Deanna Durbin's films to date but this was his first as producer. The male lead would be Bob Cummings and the script would be by Leonard Spigelglass based on a play by Régis Gignoux and Jacques Théry. Universal wanted Deanna Durbin to star but she was reluctant to make the movie. The studio attempted to borrow Mary Lee from Republic but could not agree to terms. In March Universal cast Diana Barrymore who had just made Eagle Squadron (1941) for the studio. The title was changed to Love and Kisses, Caroline. The role involved the character having to play a 12-year-old girl, Sadie Thompson and Queen Victoria. Studio boss Cliff Work called it \\"the greatest part for a girl in 20 years.\\" The following month John Boles and Kay Francis joined the cast. Shooting Filming took place from April to July 1942. Koster said Barrymore \\"was a hard person to cope with. She meant well but I think she had some of the mental difficulties her father had. She was always busy with other things when we wanted to shoot her scenes. Also it was not a good picture... They wanted to have a showcase for Diana Barrymore thinking that she might become a great actress. I don't think she had any of the Barrymore talent but she had the Madame Sans-Gene attitude on the set and in her private life. She was, well, may I say the poor man's Tallulah Bankhead.\\" Hedda Hopper visited the set to meet Barrymore. The day later Hopper wrote \\"Diana Barrymore is on the spot. With the great tradition of her family, she [Diana] can't behave like any other star out for a fling... She's likeable but has plenty to learn, and should stop playing around both on the set and in private life, which leads to those rumors floating around. No matter what Jack did, he treated the press as friend and she'd better change her tune – and quickly.\\" Hopper also wrote about an incident on set where Barrymore chased her then boyfriend Bramwell Fletcher all over the set to hit him.\\"It interfered with the scene so Bob Cummings caught her and gave her a good sound spanking\\", wrote Hopper, \\"which delighted everybody on the set except for the youngest member of the Royal Family.\\" In June the film was retitled Between Us Girls. Reception The Los Angeles Times called Barrymore \\"delightful\\". Hedda Hopper said \\"Diana as yet has no grasp of real screen acting. Young, headstrong and inexperienced she's starring in a picture in which she might be better playing a bit.\\" See also *List of films in the public domain in the United States *A Precocious Girl (1934) References External links  * Category:1942 films Category:American films Category:Films directed by Henry Koster Category:Universal Pictures films Category:1942 drama films Category:American drama films Category:American remakes of foreign films Category:Austrian film remakes Category:American black-and-white films ","title":"Between Us Girls"},{"id":"26178713","text":"Music for Millions is a 1944 musical comedy film directed by Henry Koster and starring Margaret O'Brien, José Iturbi, Jimmy Durante, June Allyson, Marsha Hunt, Hugh Herbert, Harry Davenport, and Marie Wilson.Variety film review; December 13, 1944, page 8.

The film was a remake of Grable's earlier hit 1943 film Coney Island. Plot Ruby Summers (Betty Grable) is a burlesque queen in a successful dance hall in 1892 Chicago. The owner of the dance hall Mike (Phil Harris) has cheated his ex-partner Andy Clark (Victor Mature) out of a half interest in the business. Andy schemes to potentially ruin Mike and also hopes to make Ruby a classy entertainer, as well as his own girl.

Negotiations dissolved but exhibitors had been promised that title so 20th Century Fox hastily substituted a rewrite of its 1943 Coney Island. (The Kahn biopic was made at Warner Bros. in 1951 as I'll See You in My Dreams, with Danny Thomas as Kahn.) The film became a vehicle for Betty Grable with Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas to co-star. The setting was to be the 1893 Chicago Exposition. Eventually Widmark was replaced by Victor Mature. Eventually Paul Douglas dropped out and was replaced by Phil Harris. Filming started on 9 May 1949. It was the first in a three-picture contract Koster had with Fox. The film featured five new numbers in addition to some old favourites. 87 sets were constructed included a recreation of Wabash Avenue.

Hurricane Floyd, once a large and powerful Category 4 hurricane, made landfall in North Carolina and moved northward along the East Coast, making landfall on Long Island as a tropical storm. The threat of the hurricane prompted schools in New York City to close for the first time since 1996, and 20 shelters were opened. Floyd produced flooding rainfall and gusty winds throughout the state, from the southern Hudson Valley to the Lake Champlain area. The flood waters damaged multiple roads and forced residents to evacuate from certain locations. Strong winds left as many as 100,000 people without power and brought down a high number of trees due to the saturated ground. In the aftermath of the storm, 15 counties in eastern New York were declared eligible for state or federal assistance. Background and preparations Track map of Hurricane Floyd Floyd's origins are traced back to a westward-moving tropical wave that developed into a tropical depression on September 7, 1999, while centered east of the Lesser Antilles. The system moved west-northwestward, and intensified into a tropical storm on September 8. Continuing to intensify, Floyd attained hurricane strength on September 10. The hurricane ultimately peaked as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale as it struck the Bahamas. The storm turned northwestward and soon northward, brushing the coast of Florida and the southeast United States. On September 16, Floyd made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane in North Carolina, and moved northeastward along the Eastern Seaboard. It passed through the Mid-Atlantic States as it deteriorated into a tropical storm, and lost its tropical identity over southern Maine. In advance of the storm, starting on September 15, tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued for much of the Eastern Seaboard, including portions of New York. These warnings were discontinued by September 19. New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani urged private businesses to close early and ordered non-emergency city workers to return home between 12 pm and 3 pm on September 17. For the first time since 1996, in an \\"almost unprecedented\\" decision, schools in the city were closed due to the hurricane's threat. On September 16, 20 shelters were opened, able to accommodate as many as 70,000 people. Lawrence Reuter, president of New York City Transit, reported that in an effort to prevent flooding, storm drains were cleared and other precautions were taken. People were urged to remove loose objects that could be blown around by high winds. By September 16, city officials had distributed 50,000 brochures on preparing for the storm. Suffolk County Executive Robert J. Gaffney advised residents of Fire Island to evacuate before the storm made leaving by ferry impossible, and in Long Beach, officials readied emergency vehicles. Also, 4,000 sandbags were given out there in anticipation of high storm tides. Impact Briarcliff Manor Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall on western Long Island as it moved northward. The heaviest rainfall associated with the storm was concentrated in the southeastern section of the state. Several meteorological elements worked to enhance the moisture from the cyclone. Rainfall totals exceeding were common, with as much as reported locally in the Catskills. At Cairo, of rain fell. The precipitation, combined with that of Hurricane Dennis earlier in the month, helped to alleviate persistent drought conditions. Floyd also produced gusty winds, reaching at Stewart International Airport, worsened by a pressure gradient between the storm and an area of high pressure over the Ohio Valley. Floyd's rainfall resulted in deadly and extensive flooding that killed two people in New York. Heavy flooding was reported along numerous creeks, including the Esopus, Catskill, and Schoharie. In the Albany area, the Normanskill rose to extremely high levels, and the resultant flood waters damaged nearby buildings. The Coeymans Creek in Selkirk overflowed and forced 20 families to leave their homes. The main rivers typically remained within their banks. Many roads, including U.S. Route 20 in Guilderland, were flooded or washed out, and seven families had to be evacuated along NY 32 in Menands. Further south, the Saw Mill and Bronx rivers both overflowed, and caused urban flooding. A dam on a mill pond broke near Lake Placid, leading to flooding along the Chubb River. The strong winds, combined with saturated ground from the rainfall, brought down trees in widespread areas of the Hudson Valley and Capital District. Many of the trees would not have otherwise fallen in drier conditions. Some of the downed trees fell on structures. In a narrow swath in the Wolf Pond Valley of Warren County, where wind gusts are estimated to have reached , hundreds of trees were blown down. At the storm's worst, power outages affected over 100,000 people region-wide, and some individuals remained without power for a week. At the Albany International Airport, the storm forced the cancellation of flights, and throughout the region schools were closed. Several boats sustained damage along the shore of Lake Champlain. Throughout Orange, Putnam, Rockland, and Westchester counties, initial cost estimates were $14.6 million, although that figure represents only a portion of the actual monetary damage. The storm also caused about $2 million in property damage in Essex County. Aftermath Following the storm, three New York counties were declared eligible for individual assistance, eight for individual and public assistance, and four for public assistance. The initial deadline to apply for state or federal assistance was set for November 17, although it was extended a month due to a steady flow of applications. Three disaster recovery centers were opened to provide information to residents affected by the storm. The three centers, located in Rockland, Putnam, and Westchester counties, closed in late October.

The screenplay, written by Norman Corwin, is an adaptation of the biblical Book of Ruth. The film stars Stuart Whitman as Boaz, Tom Tryon as Mahlon, Peggy Wood as Naomi, Viveca Lindfors as Eleilat, Jeff Morrow as Tob, and introduces 19-year old Elana Eden as Ruth. Plot The first part of the film revolves around Ruth, visualized as a pagan idolatress in her youth who serves as the spiritual teacher of a young Moabite girl, Tebah, who is being prepared to be sacrificed to Chemosh, a Moabite deity. Unhappy with the ritual crown created for Tebah, high-priestess Eleilat, along with Ruth, instruct Mahlon, the Judean artisan, to revamp the crown with jewels and glitter. Mahlon delivers the crown to Ruth at the temple, and he begins to question her about the existence of Chemosh. Ruth becomes doubtful of her religion and ultimately falls in love with Mahlon, sharing an interest in monotheism. The non-biblical part ends with the sight of the Moabite girl being sacrificed, from which a distressed Ruth flees. The Moabites condemn Mahlon, his father Elimelech, and brother Chilion. Chilion and Elimelech die in the prison, while Mahlon's punishment is to work at the quarries for the rest of his life. Ruth comes to free Mahlon, but he is wounded as he flees the quarry. He marries Ruth in a cave soon afterwards, and promptly dies. The biblical storyline begins as Naomi (who was married to Elimelech), Orpah (who was married to Chilion), and Ruth are widowed. The second part is based more on the Book of Ruth, although a subplot is added, that of the Bethlehemites' initial disapproval of Ruth's pagan past and Naomi's closest kinsman rejecting Ruth as his wife. As the next of kin after him, Boaz successfully obtains Ruth's hand in marriage. As the film concludes, the final verses of the Book of Ruth are quoted.

Michael Kanin and his wife, Fay Kanin, who were later hired to write the screenplay, wrote treatments for the film. Frank G. Slaughter wrote a screenplay based on his 1954 novel The Song of Ruth: A Love Story From the Old Testament. Norman Corwin wrote an entirely new screenplay after summer 1958. Corwin submitted his final draft of the script on September 1, 1959. Production began in late November 1959 and ended in mid-February 1960. Casting Susan Strasberg, a contender for the role Ruth, was tested in September 1959. Other actresses who tested for the role were Susan Kohner, Tina Louise, Diane Baker, and Millie Perkins. Israeli actress Elana Cooper and Swedish actress Ulla Jacobsson arrived in Los Angeles in September 1959 to test for the role. Myrna Fahey, who had recently signed a contract with 20th- Century Fox, was also tested. In October 1959, Cooper was cast as Ruth, changed her name from \\"Elana Cooper\\" to \\"Elana Eden,\\" and signed a \\"term pact\\" with the studio. Elana Eden as Ruth Stephen Boyd was first cast as Boaz but later turned down the role and said: \\"I think the picture would be much better without me.\\" Boyd later played Nimrod in John Huston's The Bible: In the Beginning... (1966), another biblical epic released by 20th-Century Fox. Stuart Whitman replaced Boyd as Boaz in December 1959. Helen Hayes and Irene Dunne were offered the role of Naomi before Peggy Wood was cast.

She could have been no other.'\\" Poling believed Eden's portrayal of Ruth was \\"worthy of an Oscar\\", and Variety described it as \\"a performance of dignity\\", as she projects \\"an inner strength through a delicate veneer\\". Peggy Wood's performance also received high commendation from critics. Variety noticed her \\"excellent characterization of Naomi\\" and acknowledged that her \\"timing is always sharp\\".

Beira-Mar in Segunda Liga. Playing career Fortunato played for several Italian clubs throughout his career, and had a rather successful career in the Italian top flight level. After beginning his career with Legnano, he later played for L.R. Vicenza and Atalanta before joining Serie A powerhouse Juventus, spending two seasons with the club from 1989 to 1991, scoring 5 goals in 62 appearances; during his time with the Bianconeri, Fortunato also won a UEFA Cup-Coppa Italia double during the 1989–90 season under manager Dino Zoff, despite struggling with injuries throughout the course of his first season with the club. After spending the next season at Bari, he later also played for Juventus's cross city rivals Torino from 1992 to 1994, where he won a second Coppa Italia title during 1992–93 season, before joining Atalanta again in 1994, where he remained until his retirement in 1997. Style of play A hardworking, tactically versatile and intelligent player, Fortunato was capable of playing anywhere in midfield, or even as a defender, due to his timing and positional sense. He was capable of playing on the wing, although he usually played in the centre as a defensive midfielder rather than as a deep-lying playmaker, where he usually functioned as a ball winner who was also capable of starting attacking plays after winning back possession courtesy of his solid technique and distribution. He was also capable of contributing to his team's offensive play with occasional goals. Despite his ability as a footballer, Fortunato often drew criticism throughout his career for his lack of notable pace. Coaching career After his retirement, Fortunato started a coaching career as Emiliano Mondonico's assistant at Napoli and Cosenza, and then starting a head coaching career of his own with minor league teams Cuneo, Ivrea and Pergocrema. In July 2010 he returned to work alongside his mentor Mondonico at Serie B club AlbinoLeffe, then taking over head coaching duties on 29 January 2011 after he was forced to take a sick leave due to health issues. Fortunato served as head coach for a total of two games, ended in a win and a loss, and returned to his previous assistant duties on 15 February 2011, after Mondonico successfully recovered from his health issues. On 17 June 2011 he was permanently appointed as head coach of AlbinoLeffe, after Mondonico was forced to resign due to illness. He was sacked on 28 January 2012 due to poor results. In February 2014 he was appointed coach of Beira-Mar, Portuguese second division club from the city of Aveiro. In June 2014, Fortunato was sacked from the club.

Mirza Seyyed Mohammad Tabatabai (Persian: آیت الله میرزا سید محمد طباطبائی, also known as Mohammad Sang-e-laji,;Sang-e-laj (سَنگِلَج) is one of the neighbourhoods of the Old Tehran, not far from the Grand Bazar of Tehran. The Sang-e-laj Theatre, one of the oldest theatre halls in Iran, which is still in use, is located in this neighbourhood. For further information, consult the entry Sang-e-laj in The Persian Wikipedia. 22 December 1842 - 28 January 1920) was one of the leaders of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution who played an important role in the establishment of democracy and rule of law in Iran. He was the son of Sayyed Sādegh Tabātabā'i, one of the influential clerics during the reign of Naser ad-Din Shah Qajar. His paternal grandfather, Sayyed Mehdi Tabātabā'i, was a reputed clergy in Hamedan. He is the father of Sayyed Sādegh Tabātabā'i editor of Ruznāmeh-ye Majles, the Majles newspaper. He is entombed inside a family tomb in Shah- Abdol-Azim shrine in Rey. Biography Mirzā Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i was born in Karbala, Iraq. The family moved to Hamedan when he was two years old, and to Tehran, when he was eight. He received education in the sciences, (Arabic) literature, Islamic jurisprudence and doctrines from his father, and philosophy from Mirzā Abol-Hasan Jelveh. For a period of time he was also a pupil of Sahaikh Hadi Najmābādi. The latter has been the spiritual father of a number of individuals who later played significant roles in bringing about the Constitutional Revolution of Iran, such as Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda and Mirza Jahangir Khan Sur-e Esrafil. In 1881 he left Iran for the purpose of Hajj, however as a result of his late arrival, he undertook an Umrah Hajj, after which he settled in Samarra, Iraq, where he became a pupil of Ayatollah Mirzā Mohammad Hasan Hosseini Shirāzi and completed his studies with him. Following the death of his father, he took his entire family to Samarra and for some ten years advised Ayatollah Shirāzi on political matters. On the recommendation of Ayatollah Shirāzi, he finally returned to Tehran. Due to his independent mind, in Tehran he kept away from state officials and individuals in positions of power. In his public speeches, he emphasized on the merits of freedom and incessantly stirred up the sense of loving freedom amongst his audiences. In this, he went so far as to suggesting republicanism as a viable alternative to monarchism. His latter views polarised his audiences, driving some away, and attracting some more closely instead. His ascetic lifestyle, however, very effectively protected him against personal attacks by his detractors. His emphasis permanently revolved around a national government, respect for the rule of law, equality before law, and the indiscriminate application of justice in the society.  Constitutional Revolution  The spark leading to the Constitutional Revolution of Iran is by some held to be the foot whipping of some sugar merchants in Tehran in December 1905, by the then Governor of Tehran, Ahmad Alā od-Dowleh, for disobeying the order by the government to lower the price of sugar. Following this event, a large number of people from Bazaar, together with some clergy, took sanctuary (known as Bast J. Calmard, Bast, Encyclopaedia Iranica) in Shah's Mosque (Masjed-e Shah - Imam Khomeini Mosque since 1979) in Tehran. They were however forcibly removed from this place by the agents of the then Chief Minister of Mozaffar ad-Din Shah, Ain ad-Dowleh. Following this, on the suggestion of Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i a large number of Ulema of Tehran retired to Shah-Abdol-Azim shrine and formulated a set of demands to be presented to Mozaffar ad-Din Shah. The single most important demand to be made at this juncture from Shah turned out to be the demand for establishing an Edālat'khāneh (عدالتخانه - House of Justice), of which the specifics were left unspecified. According to Keddie, this lack of detail may have been intended for preserving unity amongst the more radical modernizers and the traditional Ulema. Mozaffar ad-Din Shah accepted the demand for setting up an Edālat'khāneh and for good measure also dismissed the unpopular Governor of Tehran. Following this, the Ulema ceased their protest and returned to Tehran. The Edālat'khāneh was to be the genesis of what later became Iran's Majles. Mozaffar ad-Din Shah and his Chief Minister, Ain od-Dowleh, reneged however on their promises. Not only did they not establish an Edālat'khāneh, but violence against people continued unabated, both in Tehran and in other provinces of Iran. At this stage popular preachers such as Sayyed Jamal ad-Din Esfahani (father of the celebrated Iranian writer Mohammad-Ali Jamalzadeh) and Shaikh Mohammad Vā'ez began their most vociferous attacks on the establishment. This led to Sayyed Jamal ad-Din Esfahani being ordered to leave Tehran, an act that led to strong protests by the public. In the course of ousting Sayyed Jamal ad-Din Esfahani from Tehran, a young Sayyed (a descendant of prophet Mohammad) was shot dead by an officer, an event that led to a large mass of clergy leaving Tehran in protest and taking Bast in Qom in July 1906. This move was followed by between 12,000 and 14,000 merchants and tradesmen taking Bast in the British Legation in Tehran, bringing the commerce in Tehran to virtual standstill. In passing, it should be remarked that the orthodox historical view in the present-day Iran is that the role of the British at this juncture in the history of Iran was by no means a benevolent one, but calculated, the calculation being aimed at marginalising the religious elements of the revolutionary movement. It is well known that it was for exactly the lack of clarity as regards the role of Islam in a post-revolution era that such Constitutional Revolutionary of the first hour as Sheikh Fazlollah Noori came to take the side of Mohammad-Ali Shah and became an anti-revolutionary.The Officiate Website of Iranian Institute for Contemporary Historical Studies (مؤسسۀ مطالعات تاریخ معاصر ایران) should be consulted. In particular, this article, in Persian, by Dr Farzad Jahān'bin, is worth considering. The idea being advanced is that whereas the taking of Bast of between some 12,000 to 14,000 men in the British Legation in Tehran seems to have been spontaneous, preparations for hosting such large numbers (providing for both meals and sanitation of the individuals taking the Bast) had been in the making for months in advance. There are eye-witness reports indicating how months in advance of the event, the British middlemen had been purchasing large quantities of rice and other foodstuff in various food markets in and around Tehran and transported these at night-times into the complex housing the British Legation in Tehran. After the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the status of Sheikh Fazlollah Noori as a revolutionary has been fully restored.According to , \\"The third main leader of the Tehran ulema, Shaikh Fazlollah Nuri [the other two being Mirzā Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i and Ayatollah Sayyed Abdollah Behbahāni], did turn against the movement once it became clear that the constitution was not going to reinstate the sharia, but bring in many Western-style institutions and laws.\\" During this time Iranians began to increase their demands, demanding not only the dismissal of Shah's Chief Minister, Ain od-Dowleh, but also establishment of a national consultative assembly, what came to be known as, and become, Majles. The name of Mashrouteh (مشروطه), signifying a new political system, was floated around this time.The orthodox viewpoint in contemporary Iran (consult Iranian Institute for Contemporary Historical Studies) is that the word Mashrouteh (مشروطه), in opposition to Mashrou'eh (مشروعه) (meaning, based on religion or based on religious traditions), was insinuated and popularised by the British. According to Dehkhoda Dictionary (3rd edition, Tehran University Press, 2006), Mashrouteh is a form of state government according to which introduction and elimination of laws are the sole prerogatives of Parliament, or Houses of Parliament. In this connection, Sheikh Fazlollah Noori insisted on a Mashrou'eh form of government, according to which the sole role of Majles would be the safeguarding of the Islamic laws. At the end of July 1906, Mozaffar al-Din Shah dismissed his unpopular Chief Minister Ain od-Dowleh, and in early August 1906 he accepted the proposed institution of Majles. The first Majles came into being in October 1906, immediately after the Deputies of Tehran were elected. A committee of experts drafted the Fundamental Law, which Mozaffar al-Din Shah signed, after some delay, in December 1906. A longer Supplementary Fundamental Law, drafted in 1907, was signed by the new Shah, Mohammad-Ali Shah, in October 1907 (Mozaffar al-Din Shah died on 3 January 1907). These two charters formed the core of the Iranian written Constitution, to be supplanted by a new written Constitution after the Revolution of 1979. The rules governing the election of Deputies of Majles were originally drafted by Mozaffar al-Din Shah. His delay in making this document available led Mirzā Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i to visiting him personally at Sāheb'qrāniyeh Palace for enquiry. He left the Palace with the draft of these regulations in his hands. After some changes in this draft, it was finally ratified by Mozaffar al-Din Shah. Copies of this were subsequently dispatched to all cities in Iran. This event was celebrated on Monday 10 September 1906 by ornamenting the streets of Tehran with decorative light bulbs. Tabatabai died in Tehran in 1920, at the age of 77.  As deputy  Of the religious minority groups in Iran, only Zoroastrians had a Zoroastrian Deputy in First Majles. During the legislative period of this Majles, Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i deputised also the Iranian Christians in Majles. During this period, the Iranian Jewish community were deputised by Ayatollah Sayyed Abdollah Behbahāni.  As private person  According to Keddie, Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i \\"appears to have had genuinely liberal proclivities and considerable contact with other liberals, believed that a constitution would be the best way to limit the power of uncontrolled autocrats who were selling Iran to the Western powers.\\" With the sudden rise in the price of sugar in 1905 (see above), Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i proposed that instead of serving tea at religious gatherings, such as at Rozeh-Khāni's, the poor be given cash. In making this suggestion, he was also aiming at improving the state of public health, as he believed that not in all large gatherings the tea was being served in hygienically clean utensils, thus spreading transferable diseases amongst the population.  School and modern teaching methods  Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i founded the Islāmieh School (مدرسه اسلامیه) in Tehran where modern teaching methods were used. He appointed his brother, Assad'o'llah Tabātabā'i, as the Head of this school. During a celebration, on 28 October 1905, Sayyed Mohammad Tabātabā'i delivered a speech to the school in which he expanded on the necessity of learning and establishment of modern schools in Iran.

They moved to Memphis in 1970 with the help of Robert W. Walker and Jim Peters to begin their recording career with producer Dan Penn. They later signed with Ardent Records where they recorded alongside Big Star in the original National Street Ardent Studios location, as well as the new studio built on Madison Avenue in 1971. Keyboardist/guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Bill Phillips and guitarist/bassist/vocalist/songwriter Max Wisley formed the pop/rock quartet Rubbery Cargoe in the mid-1960s. The Tulsa-based group went through various incarnations, eventually choosing drummer /vocalist/songwriter Tim Benton and lead guitarist /vocalist/songwriter Tom Richard and later changed the name to Cargoe. Cargoe epitomized the funky Tulsa sound. The Memphis years The band that would become Cargoe established major roots in the Tulsa Music scene of the mid to late 1960s. They were Rubbery Cargoe, the psychedelic \\"house\\" band of the progressively up-scale teen only night club The Machine. It was there that Cargoe became forever linked with Jim Peters of local AM radio KAKC fame, who was the Sound, Lighting, and Voice of The Machine. As Rubbery Cargoe, they began writing original material, and were the opening act for many major hitmakers of the day, including The Cowsills, and Eric Burdon and the Animals. Rubbery Cargoe was considered one of the premier Tulsa bands, if not THE premier Tulsa band at the time. But things changed. “The Machine” closed, and there were few places that catered to musicians playing original material. Bill began College in Norman and there were weeks and even months when the band would not get together or would not have gigs to play. Things were falling apart fast. It was summer break 1969, and the band were all free for the summer. They somehow got a gig in Colorado Springs at a club that allowed them to do their own material. This turned out to be a turning point for the band. After they returned to Tulsa, Peters organized a recording session at KVOO, where the first Rubbery Cargoe demos were created. Peters' younger brother Tim, who was a soprano at the Trinity Church men and boys choir, sang high note harmony on their demo tape. Disc Jockey and close personal friend Robert W. Walker had moved to Memphis, TN where he was Music Director and radio personality for WHBQ. Through Rob’s connection with Dan Penn of The Box Tops fame, he created the opportunity for the band to make their very first record at Penn’s new Beautiful Sounds studio in Memphis. Rob and Jim would co-produce, engineer, and mix, while Beautiful would own the masters and recoup their expenses upon sale or lease of the masters to a record company. Jim and the band moved to Memphis in 1970, living with Rob, while they recorded their Album in 4 days. Later that year they all moved into an old Antebellum house at 1972 Cowden. For all involved, the address had a “magic ring” to it. Dan Penn and his partner at Beautiful, Eddie Braddock, had significant connections in the record business, so when the album neared completion, Rob and Jim went looking for bidders. Epic Records and Atlantic Records were ready to sign the original Beautiful Sounds album Jim and Rob had produced - firm offers were made - but Penn's business partners wanted to hold out for more advance money. Meanwhile, they put out a single on their own, on Penn's in-house label \\"Beautiful\\". The original Feel Allright went to #1 on Memphis radio and started spreading across the South, only to be stymied because Beautiful lacked the national distribution necessary to make it an across-the-board smash. Another major missed opportunity (harbinger of problems that would spill into the years ahead.) Jim and Rob had Managed the band all the way from Tulsa and into an opportunity few bands ever get the chance to experience. As musicians, the band members were disengaged business- wise. They became disenchanted that nothing was happening and things were falling apart again. Tensions were rising between them all, and the spirit of the adventure was fading. By the end of 1970, Rob was offered a job in Miami radio, and was ready to go. The band and Peters remained in Memphis. Ardent owner John Fry, through Rob and Jim’s introduction, had lent the band money to buy equipment, so that relationship developed into the Ardent recordings. Regrettably, that was the end of Rob and Jim’s involvement with Cargoe. Moving on to Ardent Records Often associated with the Power Pop genre given to Ardent Label Mates Big Star, Cargoe projected more of a stylized artistic nuance to their songwriting and performing, with harmonies exhibiting a strong American/Southern Roots cultural influence. The band recorded their Album CARGOE with Terry Manning producing at, John Fry's Ardent Studios. They scored numerous Billboard and Cashbox Top 100 listings, and reviews from 1970 through 1973, along with major radio play of their first single “Feel Alright” and follow-up “I Love You Anyway”. The band’s studio LP CARGOE was even featured, with Isaac Hayes Shaft, which won an Academy Award/Oscar that year for Best Original Song, in a Special Edition section of Billboard’s June 3, 1972 “The Deck is STAX” promotion. The band began a west coast tour the summer of 1972, but was caught up in the distribution and bankruptcy label problems at Stax/Volt, who distributed the album and owned the masters. Distribution was sold to Columbia Records who failed to include Cargoe in their catalog, which meant that listeners who heard the hit could not actually buy the record. “Feel Alright” and their debut CARGOE LP fell off the charts instantly. The same label troubles caused both Cargoe and Big Star to disband within a short time. Big Star went on to become one of the most beloved and influential bands of the entire decade, while Cargoe pretty much disappeared out of popular memory. Ardent Records contracts for distribution with Stax/Volt gave Stax ownership of the master tapes. When Stax went bankrupt in the mid-'70s, ownership of the masters eventually wound up in the hands of Fantasy Records Saul Zaentz, and no one's been able to get the tapes for domestic release. After nearly 40 years of producing and engineering countless hit records including ZZ Top, Led Zeppelin, George Thorogood, Celine Dion, Björk, Lenny Kravitz, Mariah Carey, Shania Twain, and many others, Terry Manning to this day regards Cargoe as “the great record he helped make that no one ever discovered”.The Cargoe Story by Frank Gutch Jr. 30 years later Their lone album, simply titled CARGOE released in 1972 on Ardent Records but available now only via a pricey Japanese JVC 2003 import, has been unavailable for fans to hear for decades. *When Ardent Records was launched in Memphis in 1972, it was Cargoe who label owners/producers/engineers John Fry and Terry Manning thought were going to put Ardent Records on the map. *It was Cargoe who were known as the hottest live band in the Memphis area in 1971-74. *It was Cargoe who scored Ardent Records first big radio hit. In 2004, when Terry Manning belatedly released an undiscovered live Stereo FM Live in Memphis, Lucky Seven Records, Big Star's Jody Stephens told author/writer Frank Gutch Jr.—not kidding at all—that he almost hated for people to hear this album, and realize that Big Star were not such a good live band after all. Cargoe's final live performance was on Halloween Night, October 31, 1972, where they opened for the legendary band Poco at the Overton Park Shell in Memphis, Tennessee. The band had planned a follow-up album, but material written back then was never recorded or released until now. Nearly 40 years later, three of the original members, Keyboardist/guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Bill Phillips, guitarist/bassist/vocalist/songwriter Max Wisley, and drummer/vocalist/songwriter Tim Benton have finally come together with undiscovered Tulsa based producer/engineer/lead guitarist /vocalist/songwriter Steve Thornbrugh, to create the follow-up album that never was. Maintaining an affinity to the original Cargoe sound and harmonies, this new adventure promises to pick up where they left off in 1972. Recording songs they wrote “in the day” for the follow-up 1972 album, this new venture moves the band back in the spotlight of original Classic core Rock Studio Performances. *Exclusive \\"WFMU Talks with Ardent and Lucky Seven's Terry Manning and Cargoe's Max Wisley & Bill Phillips\\" Interview.

Since its inception the benchmark suite has become a community project that is continued to be improved by a broad range of research institutions. PARSEC is freely available and is used for both academic and non-academic research.  Motivation  With the emergence of chip-multiprocessors computer manufacturers were faced with a problem: The new technology caused a disruptive change. For the first time in computer history software would have to be rewritten in order to take advantage of the parallel nature of those processors, which means that existing programs could not be used effectively to test and develop those new types of computer systems. At that time parallel software only existed in very specialized areas. However, before chip-multiprocessors became commonly available software developers were not willing to rewrite any mainstream programs, which means hardware manufacturers did not have access to any programs for test and development purposes that represented the expected real-world program behavior accurately. This posed a hen-and-egg problem that motivated a new type of benchmark suite with parallel programs that could take full advantage of chip- multiprocessors. PARSEC was created to break this circular dependency. It was designed to fulfill the following five objectives: # Focuses on multithreaded applications # Includes emerging workloads # Has a diverse selection of programs # Workloads employ state-of-art techniques # The suite supports research Traditional benchmarks that were publicly available before PARSEC were generally limited in their scope of included application domains or typically only available in an unparallelized, serial version.

The intent is to provide a standardized, uniform method of interpreting and describing abnormalities in chest x-rays that are thought to be caused by prolonged dust inhalation. In use, it provides a system for both epidemiological comparisons of many individuals exposed to dust and evaluation of an individual's potential disease relative to established standards. History Since 1946, the International Labour Organization has been a specialized agency of the United Nations, with objectives including establishing and overseeing international labor standards and labor rights. The International Labour Office (\\"ILO\\") is the Organization’s research body and publishing house. Since 1950, the ILO has periodically published guidelines on how to classify chest X-rays for pneumoconiosis. The purpose of the Classification was to describe and codify radiographic abnormalities of the pneumoconioses in a simple, systematic, and reproducible manner, aiding international comparisons of data, epidemiology, screening and surveillance, clinical purposes, and medical research. The most recent edition of the Guidelines,International Labour Office. International Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconiosis, rev ed. Occupational Safety and Health Series No. 22, Rev 2011. Geneva: ILO;2011; http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---safework/documents/publication/wcms_168260.pdf completed in 2011, replaced the 2000 revised edition.International Labour Office. International Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconiosis, rev ed. Occupational Safety and Health Series No. 22, Rev 2000. Geneva: ILO;2000. In 1974, after studies of surveillance programs for coal miners revealed unacceptable degrees of interreader variability,Felson B, Morgan WKC, Bristol LJ, et al. Observations on the Results of Multiple Readings of Chest Films in Coal Miners' Pneumoconiosis. Radiol, 1973;109:19-23. the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH),began the \\"B\\" reader program (so named because of the Black lung or Coal Workers' X-ray Surveillance Program), with the intent to train and certify physicians in the ILO Classification system. The \\"B\\" reader certification examinationMorgan RH. Proficiency Examination of Physicians for Classifying Pneumoconiosis Chest Films. Am J Radiol, 1979;132:803-808. went into full operation in 1978. A physician must pass the certification examination to be a \\"B\\" reader. Basic Description The ILO Classification system includes the printed Guidelines and sets of standard radiographs, available in both film and, as of 2011, digital forms. The reader compares the subject chest X-ray (only the appearances seen on postero-anterior, or PA, chest x-ray) with those of the standard set. The standard radiographs provide differing types (\\"shape and size\\") and severity (\\"profusion\\") of abnormalities seen in persons with pneumoconiosis, including Coal Workers’ Pneumoconiosis, silicosis, and asbestosis. The reader then classifies the subject x-ray, often recording the findings on the NIOSH Roentgenographic Interpretation form. The ILO Classification system pertains to pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities (small and large opacities), pleural changes (pleural plaques, calcification, and diffuse pleural thickening) and other features associated, or sometimes confused, with occupational lung disease. The \\"Complete Set\\" of standard x-rays consists of 22 radiographs: two illustrating normal profusion, fifteen of differing profusion category and shape/size of small opacity (see below), three illustrating large opacity, one of \\"u\\"-sized small opacity, and one of various pleural abnormalities. The \\"Quad Set\\" consists of 14 radiographs, nine of the most commonly used standards from the Complete Set, plus five additional composite reproductions of quadrant sections from the other radiographs in the Complete Set. The film sets were new to coincide with the ILO (2000) Guidelines; the digital set is new and coincides with the 2011 Guidelines. Methodology *Technical Quality (formerly Film Quality): :In the current ILO Classification system, the reader is first asked to grade radiographic quality. There are four technical grades: (1) Good; (2) Acceptable, with no technical defect likely to impair classification; (3) Acceptable, with some technical defect but still adequate; and (4) Unacceptable. Quality defects include over- or under-exposure, underinflation, artifacts, improper positioning, and others. *Parenchymal Abnormalities: Close-up right upper zone 2/2 R/R :Small Opacities: The reader will categorize small opacities according to shape and size. The small, rounded opacities are p (up to about 1.5 mm), q (about 1.5 mm to about 3 mm), or r (exceeding about 3mm and up to about 10 mm). Small, irregular opacities are classified by width as s, t, or u (same respective sizes as for small, rounded opacities). :Lung Zones: Each lung is mentally subdivided by the reader into 3 evenly spaced zones: upper, middle, and lower. The zones in which the small parenchymal opacities appear are recorded. :Profusion: Using the Standard X-rays, the profusion (concentration) of small opacities is classified on a 4-point major category scale (0, 1, 2, or 3), with each major category divided into three, giving 12 ordered subcategories of increasing profusion: 0/-, 0/0, 0/1, 1/0, 1/1, 1/2, 2/1, 2/2, 2/3, 3/2, 3/3, and 3/+. Category 0 refers to the absence of small opacity and category 3 represents the most profuse. The major category (first number) represents the profusion felt to best fit the subject x-ray, and the minor category (second number) represents either the profusion seriously considered as an alternative, or if none, the same profusion as the major category. For example, if the reader thinks the x-ray being read has profusion most like the standard x-ray for category 1, but serious considered category 2 as an alternative description of the profusion, then the reading is 1/2.Close-up right lower zone 2/2 S/S :Large opacities: A large opacity is defined as any opacity greater than 1 cm in diameter. They are classified as Category A (for one or more large opacities whose combined longest dimension does not exceed about 50 mm), category B (for one or more large opacities whose combined longest dimension exceeds 50 mm but does not exceed the equivalent area of the right upper lung zone), or category C (for one or more large opacities whose combined longest dimension exceed the equivalent area of the right upper lung zone). *Pleural Abnormalities: :Pleural abnormalities are reported with respect to type (pleural plaques or diffuse pleural thickening), location (chest wall, diaphragm, or other), presence of calcification, width (only of in profile pleural thickening seen along the chest wall edge), and extent (combined distance for involved chest wall). *Any Other Abnormality: :There are 29 \\"obligatory\\" symbols representing important features related to dust diseases of the lungs and other etiologies. These symbols are: aa atherosclerotic aorta; at significant apical pleural thickening; ax coalescence of small opacities; bu bulla(e); ca cancer; cg calcified granuloma or lymph node; cn calcification of small pneumoconiotic opacities; co abnormal cardiac shape or size; cp cor pulmonale; cv cavity; di marked distortion of an intrathoracic structure; ef pleural effusion; em emphysema; es eggshell calcification; fr rib fracture(s); hi enlargement of non-calcified hilar nodes; ho honeycombing; id ill-defined diaphragm border; ih ill-defined heart border; kl septal (Kerley) lines; me mesothelioma (pleural). pa plate atelectasis; pb parenchymal bands; pi pleural thickening of an interlobar fissure; px pneumothorax; ra rounded atelectasis; rp rheumatoid pneumoconiosis; tb tuberculosis; and od other disease or significant abnormality. Finally, the reader comments on any other abnormal features of the chest radiograph or other relevant information.

The research in this area is coordinated by a task group of the International Water Association (IWA). Activated sludge models are used in scientific research to study biological processes in hypothetical systems. They can also be applied on full scale wastewater treatment plants for optimisation, when carefully calibrated with reference data for sludge production and nutrients in the effluent. Around 1983 a task group of the International Association on Water Quality (one of the associations that formed IWA) was formed. They started creating on a generalised framework for mathematical models that could be used to model activated sludge for nitrogen removal.Modelling using ASM1 One of the main goals was to develop a model of which the complexity was as low as possible and simple to represent, though still able to accurately predict the biological processes. After four years, the first IAWQ model, named ASM1 was ready and incorporated a basic model for COD removal, oxygen demand, bacterial growth, and biomass degradation. An activated sludge model consists of: * state variables: these include the different fractions of COD, biomass and different types of nutrients, both organic and inorganic * a description of the dynamic processes: lists the different biological processes that are modelled, together with their formulae * parameters: variables that describe the circumstances of the biological system, such as growth and decay rate, half-saturation coefficient for hydrolysis, etc. History Before work on ASM1 started in 1983, there was already some 15 years of experience in activated sludge modelling, although every research group that worked on mathematical systems of activated sludge created its own model framework, incompatible to all others. ASM1 therefore catalysed the research and had a major impact on activated sludge modelling . ASM1 was the foundation for numerous extensions. These extensions include for example better prediction of nitrogen and phosphorus removal. Widely used extended models include ASM2, ASM2d, and ASM3P. At the time of publication of the ASM1 model, biological phosphorus removal was already used although this process was not completely understood at that time. Basic knowledge of phosphorus removing bacteria was included in the ASM1 model and parameters were adjusted accordingly. Hence after 8 years, ASM2 was published in 1995. ASM1 does not include the role of phosphorus accumulating organisms nor the relationship between biological phosphorus removal and removal of nitrogen. An enhanced version of ASM1, simply named ASM2, was developed to include biological (and chemical) phosphorus removal. As scientific understanding grew in the late 1990s, ASM2 was extended into ASM2d, principally by the addition of anoxic as well as aerobic uptake of phosphorus.  Availability  The IWA activated sludge models are commonly used in existing programs. The most common are Biowin, GPS-X, WEST, STOAT, Simba and SUMO. In addition there are Matlab implementations available to university researchers, Fortran code in the COST 682 Benchmarking report, and Modelica code in the Modelica WasteWater library.

He is best known as the bassist for the rock band the Killers, with whom he has recorded six studio albums. In addition to his work with the Killers, Stoermer has released three solo albums, 'Another Life' in 2011, Dark Arts in 2016, and Filthy Apes and Lions in 2017. Stoermer also joined the Smashing Pumpkins to tour in support of the band's ninth studio album, Monuments to an Elegy (2014), and produced Howling Bells' third studio album The Loudest Engine (2011). Early life Mark August Stoermer was born in Houston, Texas, to a German Australian father who was a physician and a big- band-style musician and an American mother who was a nurse. They moved to Las Vegas when Stoermer was three years old.Stickland, Britt. \\"Mark Stoermer- Killer Instinct\\" Bass Player Magazine. February 1, 2005. Stoermer graduated in 1995 from Chaparral High School, where he played trumpet in the jazz ensemble. His early musical influences included hip hop bands such as Public Enemy and N.W.A and later rock bands such as Nirvana, the Beatles, the Who and Pink Floyd. Stoermer played lead guitar for a number of local bands including Habit Rouge and the Negative Ponies. Before the Killers got signed, Stoermer worked as a medical courier. Stoermer also studied philosophy and music at UNLV. Stoermer has been dubbed 'The Gentle Giant' by bandmates and fans due to his quiet but kind nature, and because he is 6 feet 5 inches. Career The Killers (2002–present) It was while playing guitar with the Negative Ponies that Stoermer met Brandon Flowers and Dave Keuning, who were performing as an early incarnation of the Killers. He was a fan of the band's unique sound and was often present at the band's gigs. \\"They even asked me to join the band as a guitar player, because originally – at least according to Dave – they wanted to build a five-piece, possibly more like the Strokes with a keyboard,\\" said Stoermer in 2016. \\"I was first asked to be a second guitar player and I casually mentioned I also play bass. And then one day I got the call from Dave.\\" In September 2002 he was offered the opportunity to become the band's permanent bass player, he accepted and completed the band's lineup along with Ronnie Vannucci Jr.Kalil, Mike. \\"IN DEPTH: killers rising\\" Las Vegas Review Journal. September 18, 2005. The band's six albums each reached No. 1 on the United Kingdom Albums Chart and garnered the band seven GRAMMY Award nominations and seven BRIT Award nominations. Production work and collaborations (2010–present) In 2010, Stoermer produced rock band Howling Bells' third studio album, The Loudest Engine. The album was recorded at Battle Born Studios in Las Vegas, Nevada, and was released in September 2011. On September 24, 2014, Stoermer performed \\"Let It Down\\" and \\"Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)\\" with Dhani Harrison on Conan during George Harrison week. In late 2014 and early 2015, Stoermer played bass guitar on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins along with Billy Corgan, Jeff Schroeder and Brad Wilk. A Smashing Pumpkins fan since his teen years, Stoermer received a call from Corgan – who had become a casual acquaintance after their respective bands played a few shows together in recent years – to join the touring line- up in support of the Smashing Pumpkins' then-new album Monuments to an Elegy. The strength of the new material convinced Stoermer to accept the offer. \\"In addition to the nostalgia aspect, I also had to hear the new music, which I think is great. If the new music wasn't up to par, I wouldn't be doing it. I felt like, yeah, it was one of those things I had to do\\", he said. On December 1, 2014, Stoermer performed \\"Maida Vale\\" with Smashing Pumpkins on BBC Radio 6. On December 11, 2014, he performed \\"Being Beige\\" with Smashing Pumpkins on Jimmy Kimmel Live. On April 3, 2015, he performed \\"Drum + Fife\\" with the Smashing Pumpkins on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Hiatus with the Killers (2016–present) On May 24, 2016, the Killers announced that Stoermer was taking a break from touring \\"to pursue other educational goals and releasing a solo album.\\" The statement emphasized that Stoermer was still involved in working on the band's fifth album, and that he may still occasionally perform live with them in the future. Stoermer elaborated further in an interview: \\"I'm taking a class online right now. The reason why I'm doing that is to take a break, but not exclusively. It's a combination of a lot of things. I've been doing the Killers since 2003 and I think about a thousand shows. I just needed to step away a while from that.\\" Stoermer performed with the band at their 2017 Glastonbury Festival appearance, as well as at the Vegas Strong benefit show that December. Most recently, Stoermer returned to performing with the band as a part of their appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live in April 2019. Solo career  Another Life (2011)  The debut studio album Another Life was released on November 1, 2011, as a self- release on St. August Records. It was available for free download via markstoermer.com and sold on CD and vinyl on January 24, 2012. It was also released on iTunes the same day along with two bonus tracks. Stoermer recorded the album in early 2011 with the help of Glenn Moule and Joel Stein, from Howling Bells, and Jason Hill from Louis XIV. The album was mixed by Robert Root and mastered by Bob Ludwig. Dark Arts (2016) Dark Arts was released on August 5, 2016, as a self-release on St. August Records. The album was written and produced by Stoermer. David Hopkins was also involved in writing and production. The album was mixed and engineered by Robert Root. The first single \\"Spare the Ones that Weep\\" was released on July 22, 2016. Soon after the second single \\"Are Your Stars Out?\\" was released on July 29, 2016, and was featured on Billboard along with an interview in which Stoermer talked about his inspiration for the song's lyrics. The album was sold digitally, on CD, and on vinyl. Stoermer talked about his idea for writing \\"Dark Arts\\" with Interview Magazine: \\"I wanted to do at least one [record] that was an album experience, even though the days of the album experience may be over.

Shows  In support of Dark Arts, Stoermer invited several musicians to form the Hownds, a five-person band including David Hopkins (keyboards), Nigel Ledgerwood (rhythm guitar), Ben Lecourt (drums) and Erik Paparozzi (bass). They performed five shows in Las Vegas and Los Angeles.  Filthy Apes and Lions (2017)  Filthy Apes and Lions was released on vinyl on October 13, and digitally and on CD on November 17, 2017 through Stoermer's label St. August Records.http://www.itsallindie.com/2017/10/listen-mark-stoermer-filthy-apes- and.html The title track \\"Filthy Apes and Lions\\" was the first single released on October 13, 2017. \\"Beautiful Deformities\\" was the second single, released on November 11, 2017. Filthy Apes and Lions was written and produced by Mark Stoermer and David Hopkins with Robert Root. The album was mixed and engineered by Robert Root. Sprinkled with sixties psychedelic foundations, jazz fusion, and progressive rock, the album is very different from the work he is known for in the Killers. Stoermer talked about the songwriting process behind the single \\"Filthy Apes and Lions\\": I was doing a stream-of- consciousness, surrealistic exercise where you just write out whatever's on the top of your head, and then I started creating rhymes, not really knowing where I was going, and then that's where I got the lyrics for the song [...] \\"Filthy Apes and Lions.\\"https://www.theyoungfolks.com/music/112589/interview- mark-stoermer/ Artistry Playing style Stoermer mainly plays with a pick. He says \\"I love the punch and grit of a pick. . . I do a lot of unconscious palm muting. I love how you can instantly get that clunky tone with shorter notes. It's a great sound.\\" He tries to play the bass as a \\"half percussive. . . half melodic instrument\\". Stoermer feels that \\"You can add to a song's melodic side without taking away from the vocals. That's my favorite kind of bass playing.\\" His signature bass playing is featured prominently in the Killers' debut and sophomore albums. While his aggressive playing was a focal point in the Killers' first two albums, Stoermer's playing became more funk-driven in Day & Age, and much more reserved and subtle in Battle Born. His style of playing has influenced many other bands and even a genre of music in bass-driven New Wave-synth rock. Stoermer was featured on the cover of Bass Guitar Magazine in June 2009 and has been interviewed by other major bass guitar publications including Bass Player Magazine.\\"Cover Feature: The Killers – Mark Stoermer\\" Bass Guitar Magazine June 2009 Iss. #43Fox, Brian. \\"The Killers Mark Stoermer On Playing With A Pick\\" Bass Player Magazine. February 1, 2010. Stoermer is widely recognized for his signature tone: an overdriven signal using two modified BOSS Blues Driver pedals fed into separate amplifiers using high top-end frequencies to produce a trebly but thick, cutting sound while retaining excellent bass response, similar to that of Chris Squire (bassist of the band Yes). Stoermer is also noted for heavily accenting his notes to produce string popping, as well as his use of jumping between octaves. Influences Stoermer cites influences such as Noel Redding of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, John Entwistle of the Who, and Paul McCartney of the Beatles and solo. He also lists the Cure, U2, and New Order as influences.

It was located on a bluff of the Coosa River, near the modern Neely Henry Dam in Ragland, Alabama. The fort was built by General Andrew Jackson and several thousand militiamen in November 1813, during the Creek War and was named for Captain John Strother, Jackson's chief cartographer. The fort was rectangular in shape and had blockhouses at each corner. It also included a supply building, eight hospital huts, and twenty-five tents. On November 1, 1813, General Jackson reached the area of Ten Islands and began construction of Fort Strother. While constructing the fort, Jackson received news of a large number of Red Sticks that were in the village of Tallasseehatchee. He instructed General John Coffee to attack the village, resulting in the Battle of Tallushatchee. After the Battle of Tallushatchee, Red Stick warriors under the command of William Weatherford surrounded Fort Leslie and demanded that the inhabitants join in fighting against the United States. One of the occupants escaped and was able to reach Fort Strother and inform Jackson of the siege. Jackson ordered James White and his soldiers to guard Fort Strother while he proceeded to Fort Leslie. Instead, General John Alexander Cocke ordered White to proceed to the Hillabee towns and destroy them. Nevertheless, Jackson marched to Fort Leslie and fought the Battle of Talladega. Jackson struggled with keeping Fort Strother supplied through the winter of 1813, despite it being connected to Fort Deposit on the Tennessee River by a 55-mile long supply road.Braund 2012, p. 206. Some of the Tennessee soldiers stationed at Fort Strother became disgruntled and felt their obligation to serve had been fulfilled. These soldiers deserted their posts, but were recaptured or chose to voluntarily return, Even so, six were executed.Braund 2012, p. 163. Supplies began to arrive from Fort Deposit and Fort Armstrong, along with additional reinforcements. With these new volunteers, Jackson set out to fight the Red Sticks at the large encampment at Tohopeka, but was instead attacked en route at the Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek.Braund 2012, p. 116. Returning to Fort Strother, Jackson continued to enlarge his forces with additional soldiers and supplies. In March 1814, Jackson set out for Tohopeka and established Fort Williams. From there, his forces marched to Tohopeka and fought the Battle of Horseshoe Bend on March 27, 1814.Blackmon 2014, p. 33.

An inscribed stone marker near Highway 144, erected by the county, records a brief history of the fort. The fort site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

Creation The party was established in 1961 by Toni Pellegrini, a former secretary general of the Labour Party.Vincent E McHale (1983) Political parties of Europe, Greenwood Press, p. 630 Pellegrini had fallen out with Dom Mintoff during the 1961 politico-religious crisis, and the new party was a direct answer to Mintoff's dispute with the Catholic Church in Malta then led by Archbishop Michael Gonzi. It was designed to attract the Catholic vote of traditional Labourites refused to vote for Mintoff's Labour Party due to its anticlerical stance. It was often cited to be a resurrection of the (Catholic) Labour Party founded in 1921 by Michael Gonzi and sought to expound Catholic (leftist) social teaching. Its other aim was to deny Mintoff's party as many votes as possible and still be a party loyal both to the Church and the Queen. 1962 elections The CWP contested the 1962 elections under a manifesto promising \\"Work for all first and foremost.\\" It contested under the \\"umbrella\\" of the Catholic Church. The 'umbrella' was a reference to the four parties that contested the 1962 elections: the Nationalist Party, the Christian Workers' Party, the Democratic Nationalist Party and the Progressive Constitutionalist Party. It had the approval of the Maltese Catholic Church. Pellegrini's party received 9.5% of the vote and won four of the 50 seats in Parliament. The Nationalists gained 25 seats, the Labour Party 16, the DNP 4 and Mabel Strickland's PCP 1. In all, the 'umbrella' won 34 seats. The Nationalists hailed this as a great victory, but the Catholic Church considered it as a defeat; 36% still voted for the Labour Party under pain of interdiction. During the course of the legislature, independence was gained in 1964, but soon after the CWP soon lost a member of the Party, Daniel Micallef resigned from politics, disappointed at the fact that Pellegrini negotiated independence with a pro-British rather than a pro-Maltese agenda even though the party's manifesto stated that the CWP was against independence. 1966 elections Even if peace with the Church and the Labour Party was not to be achieved until 1969, the interdict had been lifted in 1964 (but still the ecclesiastical ban on Labour newspapers remained in force while it was still a mortal sin for the faithful to attend Labour Party meetings). As a direct result, Mintoff increased his party's share of the vote at the expense of the CWP. The 1966 election results were catastrophic for the CWP, which saw its vote share reduced to 6%, resulting in it losing all four seats. Following the elections, the party was dissolved. Pellegrini was later readmitted into the Labour Party and became a director of Xandir Malta. The result was also catastrophic for the catholic church in Malta which saw its hold on the Maltese electorate loosening. Ideology The CWP was pro-church and anticommunist. It supported independence from the United Kingdom by a gradual process of economic development. It wanted to reduce economic dependence on the British military presence and to abolish direct taxation in order top become a tax haven References Category:Defunct political parties in Malta Category:Political parties established in 1961 Category:1961 establishments in Malta Category:Political parties disestablished in 1966 Category:1966 disestablishments in Malta ","title":"Christian Workers' Party"},{"id":"26179254","text":"In mathematics, the pentagram map is a discrete dynamical system on the moduli space of polygons in the projective plane. The pentagram map takes a given polygon, finds the intersections of the shortest diagonals of the polygon, and constructs a new polygon from these intersections. Richard Schwartz introduced the pentagram map for a general polygon in a 1992 paper though it seems that the special case, in which the map is defined for pentagons only, goes back to an 1871 paper of Alfred Clebsch and a 1945 paper of Theodore Motzkin. The pentagram map is similar in spirit to the constructions underlying Desargues' theorem and Poncelet's porism. It echoes the rationale and construction underlying a conjecture of Branko Grünbaum concerning the diagonals of a polygon. Definition of the map Basic construction Suppose that the vertices of the polygon P are given by P_1,P_3,P_5,\\\\ldots The image of P under the pentagram map is the polygon Q with vertices Q_2,Q_4,Q_6,\\\\ldots as shown in the figure. Here Q_4 is the intersection of the diagonals (P_1P_5) and (P_3P_7) , and so on. test On a basic level, one can think of the pentagram map as an operation defined on convex polygons in the plane. From a more sophisticated point of view, the pentagram map is defined for a polygon contained in the projective plane over a field provided that the vertices are in sufficiently general position. The pentagram map commutes with projective transformations and thereby induces a mapping on the moduli space of projective equivalence classes of polygons. Labeling conventions The map P \\\\to Q is slightly problematic, in the sense that the indices of the P-vertices are naturally odd integers whereas the indices of Q-vertices are naturally even integers. A more conventional approach to the labeling would be to label the vertices of P and Q by integers of the same parity. One can arrange this either by adding or subtracting 1 from each of the indices of the Q-vertices. Either choice is equally canonical. An even more conventional choice would be to label the vertices of P and Q by consecutive integers, but again there are two natural choices for how to align these labellings: Either Q_k is just clockwise from P_k or just counterclockwise. In most papers on the subject, some choice is made once and for all at the beginning of the paper and then the formulas are tuned to that choice. There is a perfectly natural way to label the vertices of the second iterate of the pentagram map by consecutive integers. For this reason, the second iterate of the pentagram map is more naturally considered as an iteration defined on labeled polygons. See the figure. 300px Twisted polygons The pentagram map is also defined on the larger space of twisted polygons. A twisted N-gon is a bi-infinite sequence of points in the projective plane that is N-periodic modulo a projective transformation That is, some projective transformation M carries P_k to P_{N+k} for all k. The map M is called the monodromy of the twisted N-gon. When M is the identity, a twisted N-gon can be interpreted as an ordinary N-gon whose vertices have been listed out repeatedly. Thus, a twisted N-gon is a generalization of an ordinary N-gon. Two twisted N-gons are equivalent if a projective transformation carries one to the other. The moduli space of twisted N-gons is the set of equivalence classes of twisted N-gons. The space of twisted N-gons contains the space of ordinary N-gons as a sub- variety of co-dimension 8. Elementary properties Action on pentagons and hexagons The pentagram map is the identity on the moduli space of pentagons. This is to say that there is always a projective transformation carrying a pentagon to its image under the pentagram map. The map T^2 is the identity on the space of labeled hexagons. Here T is the second iterate of the pentagram map, which acts naturally on labeled hexagons, as described above. This is to say that the hexagons H and T^2(H) are equivalent by a label- preserving projective transformation. More precisely, the hexagons H' and T(H) are projectively equivalent, where H' is the labeled hexagon obtained from H by shifting the labels by 3. See the figure. It seems entirely possible that this fact was also known in the 19th century. 300px The action of the pentagram map on pentagons and hexagons is similar in spirit to classical configuration theorems in projective geometry such as Pascal's theorem, Desargues's theorem and others. Exponential shrinking The iterates of the pentagram map shrink any convex polygon exponentially fast to a point. This is to say that the diameter of the nth iterate of a convex polygon is less than K a^n for constants K>0 and 0 which depend on the initial polygon. Here we are taking about the geometric action on the polygons themselves, not on the moduli space of projective equivalence classes of polygons. Motivating discussion This section is meant to give a non- technical overview for much of the remainder of the article. The context for the pentagram map is projective geometry. Projective geometry is the geometry of our vision. When one looks at the top of a glass, which is a circle, one typically sees an ellipse. When one looks at a rectangular door, one sees a typically non-rectangular quadrilateral. Projective transformations convert between the various shapes one can see when looking at same object from different points of view. This is why it plays such an important role in old topics like perspective drawing and new ones like computer vision. Projective geometry is built around the fact that a straight line looks like a straight line from any perspective. The straight lines are the building blocks for the subject. The pentagram map is defined entirely in terms of points and straight lines. This makes it adapted to projective geometry. If you look at the pentagram map from another point of view (i.e., you tilt the paper on which it is drawn) then you are still looking at the pentagram map. This explains the statement that the pentagram map commutes with projective transformations. The pentagram map is fruitfully considered as a mapping on the moduli space of polygons. A moduli space is an auxiliary space whose points index other objects. For example, in Euclidean geometry, the sum of the angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. You can specify a triangle (up to scale) by giving 3 positive numbers, x,y,z such that x+y+z =180. So, each point (x,y,z) , satisfying the constraints just mentioned, indexes a triangle (up to scale). One might say that (x,y,z) are coordinates for the moduli space of scale equivalence classes of triangles. If you want to index all possible quadrilaterals, either up to scale or not, you would need some additional parameters. This would lead to a higher-dimensional moduli space. The moduli space relevant to the pentagram map is the moduli space of projective equivalence classes of polygons. Each point in this space corresponds to a polygon, except that two polygons which are different views of each other are considered the same. Since the pentagram map is adapted to projective geometry, as mentioned above, it induces a mapping on this particular moduli space. That is, given any point in the moduli space, you can apply the pentagram map to the corresponding polygon and see what new point you get. The reason for considering what the pentagram map does to the moduli space is that it gives more salient features of the map. If you just watch, geometrically, what happens to an individual polygon, say a convex polygon, then repeated application shrinks the polygon to a point. To see things more clearly, you might dilate the shrinking family of polygons so that they all have, say, the same area. If you do this, then typically you will see that the family of polygons gets long and thin. Now you can change the aspect ratio so as to try to get yet a better view of these polygons. If you do this process as systematically as possible, you find that you are simply looking at what happens to points in the moduli space. The attempts to zoom in to the picture in the most perceptive possible way lead to the introduction of the moduli space. To explain how the pentagram map acts on the moduli space, one must say a few words about the torus. One way to roughly define the torus is to say that it is the surface of an idealized donut. Another way is that it is the playing field for the Asteroids video game. Yet another way to describe the torus is to say that it is a computer screen with wrap, both left-to-right and up-to-down. The torus is a classical example of what is known in mathematics as a manifold. This is a space that looks somewhat like ordinary Euclidean space at each point, but somehow is hooked together differently. A sphere is another example of a manifold. This is why it took people so long to figure out that the Earth was not flat; on small scales one cannot easily distinguish a sphere from a plane. So, too, with manifolds like the torus. There are higher-dimensional tori as well. You could imagine playing Asteroids in your room, where you can freely go through the walls and ceiling/floor, popping out on the opposite side. One can do experiments with the pentagram map, where one looks at how this mapping acts on the moduli space of polygons. One starts with a point and just traces what happens to it as the map is applied over and over again. One sees a surprising thing: These points seem to line up along multi-dimensional tori. These invisible tori fill up the moduli space somewhat like the way the layers of an onion fill up the onion itself, or how the individual cards in a deck fill up the deck. The technical statement is that the tori make a foliation of the moduli space. The tori have half the dimension of the moduli space. For instance, the moduli space of 7 -gons is 6 dimensional and the tori in this case are 3 dimensional. The tori are invisible subsets of the moduli space. They are only revealed when one does the pentagram map and watches a point move round and round, filling up one of the tori. Roughly speaking, when dynamical systems have these invariant tori, they are called integrable systems. Most of the results in this article have to do with establishing that the pentagram map is an integrable system, that these tori really exist. The monodromy invariants, discussed below, turn out to be the equations for the tori. The Poisson bracket, discussed below, is a more sophisticated math gadget that sort of encodes the local geometry of the tori. What is nice is that the various objects fit together exactly, and together add up to a proof that this torus motion really exists. Coordinates for the moduli space Cross-ratio When the field underlying all the constructions is F, the affine line is just a copy of F. The affine line is a subset of the projective line. Any finite list of points in the projective line can be moved into the affine line by a suitable projective transformation. Given the four points t_1,t_2,t_3,t_4 in the affine line one defines the (inverse) cross ratio : X=\\\\frac{(t_1 - t_2)(t_3 - t_4)}{(t_1 - t_3)(t_2 - t_4)}. Most authors consider 1/X to be the cross-ratio, and that is why X is called the inverse cross ratio. The inverse cross ratio is invariant under projective transformations and thus makes sense for points in the projective line. However, the formula above only makes sense for points in the affine line. In the slightly more general set-up below, the cross ratio makes sense for any four collinear points in projective space One just identifies the line containing the points with the projective line by a suitable projective transformation and then uses the formula above. The result is independent of any choices made in the identification. The inverse cross ratio is used in order to define a coordinate system on the moduli space of polygons, both ordinary and twisted. The corner coordinates The corner invariants are basic coordinates on the space of twisted polygons. Suppose that P is a polygon. A flag of P is a pair (p,L), where p is a vertex of P and L is an adjacent line of P. Each vertex of P is involved in two flags, and likewise each edge of P is involved in two flags. The flags of P are ordered according to the orientation of P, as shown in the figure. In this figure, a flag is represented by a thick arrow. Thus, there are 2N flags associated to an N-gon. 300px 300px Let P be an N-gon, with flags F_1,\\\\ldots,F_{2N} To each flag F, we associate the inverse cross ratio of the points t_1,t_2,t_3,t_4 shown in the figure at left. In this way, one associates numbers x_1,\\\\ldots,x_{2n} to an n-gon. If two n-gons are related by a projective transformation, they get the same coordinates. Sometimes the variables x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,\\\\ldots are used in place of x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,\\\\ldots\\\\,. The corner invariants make sense on the moduli space of twisted polygons. When one defines the corner invariants of a twisted polygon, one obtains a 2N-periodic bi-infinite sequence of numbers. Taking one period of this sequence identifies a twisted N-gon with a point in F^{2N} where F is the underlying field. Conversely, given almost any (in the sense of measure theory) point in F^{2N} one can construct a twisted N-gon having this list of corner invariants. Such a list will not always give rise to an ordinary polygon; there are an additional 8 equations which the list must satisfy for it to give rise to an ordinary N-gon. (ab) coordinates There is a second set of coordinates for the moduli space of twisted polygons, developed by Sergei Tabachnikov and Valentin Ovsienko. One describes a polygon in the projective plane by a sequence of vectors \\\\ldots V_1,V_2,V_3,\\\\ldots in R^3 so that each consecutive triple of vectors spans a parallelepiped having unit volume. This leads to the relation : V_{i+3} = a_i V_{i+2} + b_i V_{i+1} + V_i The coordinates a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2,\\\\ldots serve as coordinates for the moduli space of twisted N-gons as long as N is not divisible by 3\\\\. The (ab) coordinates bring out the close analogy between twisted polygons and solutions of 3rd order linear ordinary differential equations, normalized to have unit Wronskian. Formula for the pentagram map As a birational mapping  Here is a formula for the pentagram map, expressed in corner coordinates. The equations work more gracefully when one considers the second iterate of the pentagram map, thanks to the canonical labelling scheme discussed above. The second iterate of the pentagram map is the composition B \\\\circ A. The maps A and B are birational mappings of order 2, and have the following action. : A(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_{2N})=(a_1,\\\\ldots,a_{2N}) : B(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_{2N})=(b_1,\\\\ldots,b_{2N}) where : \\\\begin{align} a_{2k-1} & = \\\\frac{(1-x_{2k+1}x_{2k+2})}{(1-x_{2k-3}x_{2k-2})} x_{2k+0} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] a_{2k+0} & = \\\\frac{(1-x_{2k-3}x_{2k-2})}{(1-x_{2k+1}x_{2k+2})} x_{2k-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] b_{2k+1} & =\\\\frac{(1-x_{2k-2}x_{2k-1})}{(1-x_{2k+2}x_{2k+3})} x_{2k+0} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] b_{2k+0} & = \\\\frac{(1-x_{2k+2}x_{2k+3})}{(1-x_{2k-2}x_{2k-1})} x_{2k-1} \\\\end{align} (Note: the index 2k + 0 is just 2k. The 0 is added to align the formulas.) In these coordinates, the pentagram map is a birational mapping of F^{2N} As grid compatibility relations right The formula for the pentagram map has a convenient interpretation as a certain compatibility rule for labelings on the edges of triangular grid, as shown in the figure. In this interpretation, the corner invariants of a polygon P label the non-horizontal edges of a single row, and then the non-horizontal edges of subsequent rows are labeled by the corner invariants of A(P) , B(A(P)), A(B(A(P))) , and so forth. the compatibility rules are : c=1-ab : wx=yz These rules are meant to hold for all configurations which are congruent to the ones shown in the figure. In other words, the figures involved in the relations can be in all possible positions and orientations. The labels on the horizontal edges are simply auxiliary variables introduced to make the formulas simpler. Once a single row of non-horizontal edges is provided, the remaining rows are uniquely determined by the compatibility rules. Invariant structures Corner coordinate products It follows directly from the formula for the pentagram map, in terms of corner coordinates, that the two quantities : O_N= x_1x_3\\\\cdots x_{2N-1} : E_N = x_2x_4\\\\cdots x_{2N} are invariant under the pentagram map. This observation is closely related to the 1991 paper of Joseph Zaks concerning the diagonals of a polygon. When N = 2k is even, the functions : O_k = x_1x_5x_9 \\\\cdots x_{2N-3}+ x_3x_7x_{11} \\\\cdots x_{2N-1} : E_k = x_2x_6x_{10} \\\\cdots x_{2N-2}+ x_4x_8x_{12} \\\\cdots x_{2N} are likewise seen, directly from the formula, to be invariant functions. All these products turn out to be Casimir invariants with respect to the invariant Poisson bracket discussed below. At the same time, the functions O_k and E_k are the simplest examples of the monodromy invariants defined below. The level sets of the function f=O_NE_N are compact, when f is restricted to the moduli space of real convex polygons. Hence, each orbit of the pentagram map acting on this space has a compact closure. Volume form The pentagram map, when acting on the moduli space X of convex polygons, has an invariant volume form. At the same time, as was already mentioned, the function f=O_NE_N has compact level sets on X. These two properties combine with the Poincaré recurrence theorem to imply that the action of the pentagram map on X is recurrent: The orbit of almost any equivalence class of convex polygon P returns infinitely often to every neighborhood of P. This is to say that, modulo projective transformations, one typically sees nearly the same shape, over and over again, as one iterates the pentagram map. (It is important to remember that one is considering the projective equivalence classes of convex polygons. The fact that the pentagram map visibly shrinks a convex polygon is irrelevant.) It is worth mentioning that the recurrence result is subsumed by the complete integrability results discussed below. Monodromy invariants The so-called monodromy invariants are a collection of functions on the moduli space that are invariant under the pentagram map. With a view towards defining the monodromy invariants, say that a block is either a single integer or a triple of consecutive integers, for instance 1 and 567. Say that a block is odd if it starts with an odd integer. Say that two blocks are well- separated if they have at least 3 integers between them. For instance 123 and 567 are not well separated but 123 and 789 are well separated. Say that an odd admissible sequence is a finite sequence of integers that decomposes into well separated odd blocks. When we take these sequences from the set 1, ..., 2N, the notion of well separation is meant in the cyclic sense. Thus, 1 and 2N − 1 are not well separated. Each odd admissible sequence gives rise to a monomial in the corner invariants. This is best illustrated by example *1567 gives rise to \\\\- x_1x_5x_6x_7 *123789 gives rise to \\\\+ x_1x_2x_3x_7x_8x_9 The sign is determined by the parity of the number of single-digit blocks in the sequence. The monodromy invariant O_k is defined as the sum of all monomials coming from odd admissible sequences composed of k blocks. The monodromy invariant E_k is defined the same way, with even replacing odd in the definition. When N is odd, the allowable values of k are 1, 2, ..., (n − 1)/2. When N is even, the allowable values of k are 1, 2, ..., n/2. When k = n/2, one recovers the product invariants discussed above. In both cases, the invariants O_N and E_N are counted as monodromy invariants, even though they are not produced by the above construction. The monodromy invariants are defined on the space of twisted polygons, and restrict to give invariants on the space of closed polygons. They have the following geometric interpretation. The monodromy M of a twisted polygon is a certain rational function in the corner coordinates. The monodromy invariants are essentially the homogeneous parts of the trace of M. There is also a description of the monodromy invariants in terms of the (ab) coordinates. In these coordinates, the invariants arise as certain determinants of 4-diagonal matrices. Whenever P has all its vertices on a conic section (such as a circle) one has O_k(P)=E_k(P) for all k. Poisson bracket A Poisson bracket is an anti-symmetric linear operator \\\\\\\\{\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot\\\\\\\\} on the space of functions which satisfies the Leibniz Identity and the Jacobi identity. In a 2010 paper, Valentin Ovsienko, Richard Schwartz and Sergei Tabachnikov produced a Poisson bracket on the space of twisted polygons which is invariant under the pentagram map. They also showed that monodromy invariants commute with respect to this bracket. This is to say that : \\\\\\\\{O_i,O_j\\\\\\\\}=\\\\\\\\{O_i,E_j\\\\\\\\}=\\\\\\\\{E_i,E_j\\\\\\\\}=0 for all indices. Here is a description of the invariant Poisson bracket in terms of the variables. : x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,\\\\ldots\\\\,. : \\\\\\\\{x_i,x_{i+1}\\\\\\\\} = -x_i\\\\, x_{i+1} : \\\\\\\\{x_i, x_{i-1}\\\\\\\\} = x_i\\\\, x_{i-1} : \\\\\\\\{y_i,y_{i+1}\\\\\\\\} = y_i\\\\, y_{i+1} : \\\\\\\\{y_i,y_{i-1}\\\\\\\\} = -y_i\\\\, y_{i-1} : \\\\\\\\{x_i,x_j\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{y_i,y_j\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{x_i,y_j\\\\\\\\} = 0 for all other i,j. There is also a description in terms of the (ab) coordinates, but it is more complicated. Here is an alternate description of the invariant bracket. Given any function f on the moduli space, we have the so-called Hamiltonian vector field : H(f) = \\\\left( x_{i+1} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x_{i+1}} - x_{i-1} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x_{i-1}} \\\\right) x_i \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_i} + \\\\left( y_{i-1} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial y_{i-1}} - y_{i+1} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial y_{i+1}} \\\\right) y_i \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y_i} where a summation over the repeated indices is understood. Then : H(f) g = \\\\\\\\{f,g\\\\\\\\} The first expression is the directional derivative of g in the direction of the vector field H(f) . In practical terms, the fact that the monodromy invariants Poisson-commute means that the corresponding Hamiltonian vector fields define commuting flows. Complete integrability Arnold–Liouville integrability The monodromy invariants and the invariant bracket combine to establish Arnold–Liouville integrability of the pentagram map on the space of twisted N-gons. The situation is easier to describe for N odd. In this case, the two products : O_n =x_1\\\\cdots x_n : E_n = y_1\\\\cdots y_n are Casimir invariants for the bracket, meaning (in this context) that : \\\\\\\\{O_n,f\\\\\\\\}=\\\\\\\\{E_n,f\\\\\\\\} =0 for all functions f. A Casimir level set is the set of all points in the space having a specified value for both O_n and E_n . Each Casimir level set has an iso-monodromy foliation, namely, a decomposition into the common level sets of the remaining monodromy functions. The Hamiltonian vector fields associated to the remaining monodromy invariants generically span the tangent distribution to the iso-monodromy foliation. The fact that the monodromy invariants Poisson-commute means that these vector fields define commuting flows. These flows in turn define local coordinate charts on each iso-monodromy level such that the transition maps are Euclidean translations. That is, the Hamiltonian vector fields impart a flat Euclidean structure on the iso-monodromy levels, forcing them to be flat tori when they are smooth and compact manifolds. This happens for almost every level set. Since everything in sight is pentagram-invariant, the pentagram map, restricted to an iso-monodromy leaf, must be a translation. This kind of motion is known as quasi-periodic motion. This explains the Arnold-Liouville integrability. From the point of view of symplectic geometry, the Poisson bracket gives rise to a symplectic form on each Casimir level set. Algebro- geometric integrability In a 2011 preprint, Fedor Soloviev showed that the pentagram map has a Lax representation with a spectral parameter, and proved its algebraic-geometric integrability. This means that the space of polygons (either twisted or ordinary) is parametrized in terms of a spectral curve with marked points and a divisor. The spectral curve is determined by the monodromy invariants, and the divisor corresponds to a point on a torus—the Jacobi variety of the spectral curve. The algebraic-geometric methods guarantee that the pentagram map exhibits quasi-periodic motion on a torus (both in the twisted and the ordinary case), and they allow one to construct explicit solutions formulas using Riemann theta functions (i.e., the variables that determine the polygon as explicit functions of time). Soloviev also obtains the invariant Poisson bracket from the Krichever–Phong universal formula. Connections to other topics The Octahedral recurrence  The octahedral recurrence is a dynamical system defined on the vertices of the octahedral tiling of space. Each octahedron has 6 vertices, and these vertices are labelled in such a way that : a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 = a_3b_3 Here a_i and b_i are the labels of antipodal vertices. A common convention is that a_2,b_2,a_3,b_3 always lie in a central horizontal plane and a_1,b_1 are the top and bottom vertices. The octahedral recurrence is closely related to C. L. Dodgson's method of condensation for computing determinants. Typically one labels two horizontal layers of the tiling and then uses the basic rule to let the labels propagate dynamically. Max Glick used the cluster algebra formalism to find formulas for the iterates of the pentagram map in terms of alternating sign matrices. These formulas are similar in spirit to the formulas found by David P. Robbins and Harold Rumsey for the iterates of the octahedral recurrence. right Alternatively, the following construction relates the octahedral recurrence directly to the pentagram map. Let T be the octahedral tiling. Let \\\\pi: T \\\\to R^2 be the linear projection which maps each octahedron in T to the configuration of 6 points shown in the first figure. Say that an adapted labeling of T is a labeling so that all points in the (infinite) inverse image of any point in G=\\\\pi(T) get the same numerical label. The octahedral recurrence applied to an adapted labeling is the same as a recurrence on G in which the same rule as for the octahedral recurrence is applied to every configuration of points congruent to the configuration in the first figure. Call this the planar octahedral recurrence. right Given a labeling of G which obeys the planar octahedral recurrence, one can create a labeling of the edges of G by applying the rule : v=AD/BC to every edge. This rule refers to the figure at right and is meant to apply to every configuration that is congruent to the two shown. When this labeling is done, the edge-labeling of G satisfies the relations for the pentagram map. The Boussinesq equation The continuous limit of a convex polygon is a parametrized convex curve in the plane. When the time parameter is suitably chosen, the continuous limit of the pentagram map is the classical Boussinesq equation. This equation is a classical example of an integrable partial differential equation. Here is a description of the geometric action of the Boussinesq equation. Given a locally convex curve C:R\\\\to R^2 , and real numbers x and t, we consider the chord connecting C(x-t) to C(x+t) . The envelop of all these chords is a new curve C_t(x) . When t is extremely small, the curve C_t(x) is a good model for the time t evolution of the original curve C_0(x) under the Boussinesq equation. This geometric description makes it fairly obvious that the B-equation is the continuous limit of the pentagram map. At the same time, the pentagram invariant bracket is a discretization of a well known invariant Poisson bracket associated to the Boussinesq equation. Recently, there has been some work on higher- dimensional generalizations of the pentagram map and its connections to Boussinesq-type partial differential equations Projectively natural evolution The pentagram map and the Boussinesq equation are examples of projectively natural geometric evolution equations. Such equations arise in diverse fields of mathematics, such as projective geometry and computer vision.

Haloxylon and its species are known by the common name saxaul. According to Dmitry Ushakov, the name borrowed from the Kazakh \\"seksevil\\". In modern Kazakh language, the shrub is called \\"seksewil\\". According to the school etymological dictionary, the name saksaul borrowed in the XIX century from the Turkic languages. Description The species of genus Haloxylon are shrubs or small trees (rarely up to ) tall, with a thick trunk and many branches. The branches of the current year are green, from erect to pendant. The leaves are reduced to small scales. The inflorescences are short shoots borne on the stems of the previous year. The flowers are very small, as long or shorter than the bracteoles, bisexual or male. The two stigmas are very short. In fruit, the perianth segments develop spreading wings. The fruit with wings is about in diameter. The seed is about in diameter. Distribution The genus Haloxylon is distributed in southwest and Central Asia, from Egypt to Mongolia and China (Sinkiang and Kansu), where it grows in sandy habitats (psammophyte). Taxonomy The genus name Haloxylon was published by Alexander Bunge (ex Eduard Fenzl) in 1851, with the type species Haloxylon ammodendron. The genus belongs to the subfamily Salsoloideae in the family Amaranthaceae, It consists of only 2 species: * Haloxylon ammodendron (C.A.Mey.) Bunge ex Fenzl. (Synonym: Haloxylon aphyllumTropicos) – black saxaul * Haloxylon persicum Bunge ex Boiss. – white saxaul Phylogenetic research revealed that several species formerly included in Haloxylon are not related to this genus. They are now classified to genus Hammada, with exception of the former Haloxylon stocksii (syn. Haloxylon recurvum), which has been moved to Salsola stocksii. The common name saxaul, sometimes sacsaoul or saksaul, comes from the Russian саксаул (saksaul), which is from Kazakh сексеуiл (seksewil). Ecology In the deserts of Central Asia, a large number of birds are associated with saxaul, including the saxaul sparrow. In the former bed of the Aral Sea, saxaul trees are being planted to stop the wind picking up contaminated sand from the dried up sea bed and spreading them through the atmosphere. The plan is to cover the entire former bed with a forest.

It is found in Rwanda, Uganda, from Ethiopia to Malawi. It grows in wet forests up to 2000 m ASL and is abundant in swamp forests along Lake Victoria. Description The tree is up to 20 m high, has a few large branches that forms a rounded crown. The bark is light grey brown, fairly rough and thick. The leaves are large, in opposite pairs, shiny above and widely oval. Flowers occur in round heads, 2.5 cm across, green-yellow-white with a sweet scent on 3–7 cm long stalks. The fruits in the head are capsules around 1 cm long, and contain a few tiny winged seeds (). Uses The timber is fairly good and it is used for firewood, charcoal, timber, to make dug out canoes and for soil improvement. Medicinal use The bark and roots are widely used in the areas where it grows. In the Sango Bay area in Uganda, it is one of the three most commonly used plants to treat malaria., This area is one of the areas in Uganda most heavily affected by malaria, and the Health care system is poorly developed. People to a great extent use plants to treat different illnesses. The two other top species used for malaria are Warburgia salutaris and Syzygium guineense, all of them are trees with bark as main plant part used. The few individuals of W. salutaris and some of the H. rubrostipulata found were heavily debarked. The trees are also difficult to access in the rainy season, when the mosquitoes and malaria are at the worst, as the forest is flooded for 2–3 months. Community project to improve human and environmental health The research by Ssesegawa and Kasenene initiated a community project. Two small nurseries were established with a little support from Uganda Forest Department, the People and Planet initiative in UK and The Uganda Group of the African Network of Ethnobiology (UGANEB). The objective of the project was to collect seeds and raise seedlings of important plants used for malaria. Using a community-based approach, the project investigated how to develop management systems to allow sustainable use of the targeted species. Cultivation of the plants was promoted to provide material for treatments locally and also to sell to provide income. Together with representatives for UGANEB, the villagers also visited Tooro Botanical Gardens in Fort Portal and the Namanve Tree Seed Centre in Kampala, which gave them valuable inspiration and knowledge. The nurseries were run by local people. They managed to raise seedling of W.salutaris and S. guinense, but had problems with the germination of H.rubrostipulata. A laboratory experiment on germination of Hallea showed that viable seeds germinated plentiful (>60%) and very quick (2–10 days), but they needed light to germinate. The nurseries have now succeeded in raising seedlings of all the trees, and seedling are distributed to community members. This is a good example of how local people, researchers, NGOs and governmental institutions can work together to improve livelihood for people as well as improving management of natural resources.

It was built in 1907, but ran into financial difficulties. It passed over to the Mons Mill (1919) Co Ltd and then was taken over by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in the 1930s and passed to Courtaulds in 1964 and production stopped in 1968. It was used into the 1990s by Ward & Goldestone Ltd. The site was cleared in 2000. Location Todmorden is a market town and civil parish, within the Metropolitan Borough of Calderdale, in West Yorkshire, England. It forms part of the Upper Calder Valley and has a total population of 14,941.Office for National Statistics: Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Calderdale Retrieved 2009-09-02 It is north north east of Manchester, west of Halifax and south east of Burnley. Todmorden town centre occupies the confluence of three steep-sided valleys in the Pennines. The valleys constrict the shape of the town. Todmorden is surrounded by moorlands with occasional outcrops of gritstone sandblasted by winds. The historic county boundary between Yorkshire and Lancashire was marked by the River Calder and its tributary the Walsden Water, which runs through the centre of the town. The historic border remains but the administrative border was altered by the Local Government Act 1888, whereby today all of Todmorden lies within West Yorkshire. The town is served by Todmorden railway station and Walsden railway station. History For hundreds of years streams from the surrounding hills provided water for corn and fulling mills. Todmorden grew to relative prosperity by combining farming with the production of woollen textiles. Some Yeomen clothiers were able to build fine houses, a few of which still exist today. Increasingly, though, the area turned to cotton. The proximity of Manchester as a source of material and trade was undoubtedly a strong factor. Another was that the strong Pennine streams and rivers were able to power the machine looms. Improvements in textile machinery (by Kay, Hargreaves and Arkwright), along with the development of turnpike roads (1751–81) helped to develop the new cotton industry and increase the local population. During the years 1800–45 great changes took place in the communications and transport of the town which were to have a crucial effect on promoting industrial growth. These included the building of: (1) better roads; (2) the Rochdale Canal (1804); and (3) the main line of the Manchester and Leeds Railway (1841), which became the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway in 1847. This railway line incorporated the (then) longest tunnel in the world, the 2,885 yard Summit Tunnel. A second railway, from Todmorden to Burnley, opened as a single line in 1849, being doubled to meet demand in 1860. A short connecting line, from Stansfield Hall to Hall Royd, completed the \\"Todmorden Triangle\\" in 1862, thus enabling trains to travel in all three directions (Manchester, Leeds and Burnley) without reversing. The Industrial Revolution caused a concentration of industry and settlement along the valley floor and a switch from woollens to cotton. One family in the area was particularly influential on the town: the Fielden family. They created a \\"dynasty\\" that changed the town forever by establishing several large mills, putting up assorted impressive buildings and bringing about social and educational change. Hare Mill was built in 1907; the first sod was cut on 1 June 1907. It had cost £218,285 to build, and there were financial and boardroom problems and the mill finally opened in August 1912. A second identical mill was proposed, but never built. There was the logo of a white hare on the mill chimney. The company was wound up in 1914. The mill was bought by William Hopwood for £131,450. He sold it to the newly formed Mons Mill Company Limited and the mill was renamed Mons Mill (after the Battle of Mons). There was a later company Mons Mill (1919) Limited which took over the mill in 1919. The industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The Great War of 1914–18 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Mons Mill, Todmorden was one of 104 mills bought by the LCC, and one of the 53 mills that survived beyond 1950. In 1974, the LCC was taken over by Courtaulds. In 1968, the mill closed. From 1971, the building was used by Ward & Goldstone Limited until the 1990s when they left. In the 1970s, the mill chimney was reduced by 30 ft. In 1986, the mill chimney and the engine house were demolished. The site was cleared in March 2000.  Architecture  Seven- storied steam-powered cotton-spinning mill built for the Hare Spinning Company Limited. It was constructed of red Accrington brick, designed by Abraham Stott. Stott's design utilised rolled steel columns and reinforced concrete, and was unpopular when it was first proposed. There was the logo of a white hare on the mill chimney.  Power  The mill was originally powered by an engine built by Carels of Belgium which drove about 73 belts.

The Sydney-based team competes in the Virgin Australia Supercars Championship using two Holden ZB Commodore chassis built by Triple Eight Race Engineering. The team's current Supercars drivers are Alex Davison and Chris Pither. In 2016, the team won both the Bathurst 12 Hour and Bathurst 1000. History Formed originally as a Porsche team running in the Australian Porsche Cup by Steve Webb, having previously raced Kaditchas in the Australian Sports Car Championship and Ralts in the Australian Drivers' Championship. Webb raced Porsches with modest success for several seasons, moving into the Australian Nations Cup Championship, a GT based racing series, in 2000. Gradually as the 2000s progressed the team's emphasis shifted from Steve to Jonathon as he emerged through the ranks of Australian motor racers. Jonathon Webb joined the Australian Carrera Cup Championship when it was formed in 2003 and finished third in his best ever season in 2005.  V8 Supercar Development Series  For 2007, Tekno moved into the second-tier Fujitsu V8 Supercar Series and operated a Ford BA Falcon in the series with the assistance of Stone Brothers Racing. Under the racing number of #94, Webb placed fourth for the season. This relationship continued into 2008, with Webb placing third. In 2009, Tekno wound down as an operational racing team with Webb moving to the MW Motorsport team. Supercars Championship In 2010 Tekno entered what was then known as the V8 Supercar Championship Series with a Racing Entitlement Contract (REC) purchased from Tasman Motorsport. It linked up with veteran Queensland Ford racing team, Dick Johnson Racing with Webb racing a former Craig Lowndes Triple Eight Race Engineering Ford FG Falcon as #19.Third DJR entry for webb finalised Mid-season, the team attained a title sponsor, Mother Energy Drinks. David Russell joined the team for the endurance events, the Phillip Island 500 and Bathurst 1000. Sebastian Bourdais joined the team for the Gold Coast 600. At the final event of the year, the 2010 Sydney Telstra 500, the team recorded their first win, with Webb winning the rain-affected Saturday race. Tekno severed their relationship with Dick Johnson Racing in 2011 and became an independent single car team, still utilising the #19. The team maintained the sponsorship links with Mother Energy Drinks and had their engines built by InnoV8 Race Engines. Richard Lyons was the endurance co-driver for Phillip Island and Bathurst, with Gil de Ferran joining Webb for the Gold Coast 600. The 2012 season saw the team expand to two cars which included a move to Holden and becoming a Triple Eight Race Engineering customer.Webb confirms switch to Holden in 2012 Webb continued to drive the #19 car, with Michael Patrizi recruited to drive the #91 Commodore with a REC leased from Paul Morris Motorsport. Scott McLaughlin and Jonny Reid were the endurance drivers for Sandown and Bathurst, with Marc Lieb and Lucas di Grassi joining Webb and Patrizi respectively on the Gold Coast. Webb finished the 2012 season in 12th Position, with Patrizi in 18th despite competing without a full-time title sponsor all year. Michael Patrizi was replaced in 2013 with Shane van Gisbergen, in a controversial move after van Gisbergen was granted a release from his Stone Brothers Racing contract on the basis he wanted time away from the sport. Both entries acquired new sponsors, with Darrell Lea sponsoring Webb's car #19 and VIP Petfoods van Gisbergen's #97 entry. Van Gisbergen quickly established himself a race winning threat in the team's new Triple Eight constructed Holden VF Commodore taking victory at Race 2 at the 2013 Clipsal 500 and Sydney 500. Webb also won the Skycity Triple Crown event despite not winning a race over the weekend. For the newly introduced Enduro Cup, Marc Lieb returned to join Webb, with Jeroen Bleekemolen joining van Gisbergen. For 2014, the team returned to a single car operation with the leased REC returned to Paul Morris Motorsport and van Gisbergen driving the single entry to finish second in the championship. Webb joined van Gisbergen in the Enduro Cup, and after starting from pole, the pair were leading the 2014 Bathurst 1000 in the closing stages before a starter motor failed, leaving the car stuck in the pits for several minutes. In both 2014 and 2015, van Gisbergen and Webb won one race of the Gold Coast 600. Van Gisbergen finished fourth in the 2015 championship, only adding another race win at the Sydney 500 to his Gold Coast victory. In 2016, Will Davison replaced van Gisbergen. The move brought near-immediate success, with the team winning the second round of the year, the Tasmania SuperSprint. After a lean patch in the middle of the year, Davison, partnered with Webb, returned to form at the Enduro Cup. After finishing third at Sandown, at the Bathurst 1000, Davison achieved an even better result, capitalising on late drama between the race leaders to take his second Bathurst crown, despite not leading any laps, only one tenth of a second ahead of van Gisbergen. In 2020, the team will return to a two-car operation and relocate to Western Sydney. Endurance/GT racing Tekno Autosports campaigned two McLaren 650S GT3 cars in the 2016 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour. Shane van Gisbergen, Jonathon Webb and Álvaro Parente won the race, with the sister car of Will Davison, Robert Bell and Andrew Watson finishing 9th. With a third car this relationship continued into the 2016 Australian GT Championship.

The forums discussed labor issues along with social concerns of the day. Soon, in early 1915, Jones needed a new venue as the capacity was exceeded at the forum. To accommodate increased participants, Jones found a decrepit barn on Tooker Alley, off of Dearborn Street in downtown Chicago that he would name the Dil Pickle Club. Soon after, fellow labor organizer from Ireland, Jim Larkin would join Jones along with the \\"hobo doctor\\" and anarchist Ben Reitman. Reitman would be instrumental in getting regular news coverage of the Pickle in the Chicago Daily News and Chicago Tribune. The news coverage would help increase the club's following and by 1917, Jones created the Dil Pickle Artisans by officially incorporating it as a non-profit in Illinois for its promotion of arts, crafts, science and literature. Jones would say of his new club: Stanislav Szukalski During the early years of the Dil Pickle Club, Jones began the Dil Pickle Press which produced material to promote the club. The Dil Pickler newsletter, The Creative World bulletin along with Jones' book Tech-Up were printed. The Press also printed Arthur Desmond's Lion's Paw, Ragnar Redbeard's Might Is Right along with works by Sol Omar and J. Edgar Miller. Most of the literature was often crudely designed but easily reproduced. It contained humor and often typos. Admission to the club and refreshment sales helped it survive financially. Jones may have also printed counterfeit out-of-print books in order to make additional money. The club would reach its pinnacle by not only serving as a place for debate and idea-sharing but a host for one-act plays, poetry readings, jazz dances, opera along with other acts. The Dil Pickle Players was formed in order to perform original works by local authors as well as contemporary playwrights. Jones was often very active in the club; building the stage, wiring the lighting along with writing, directing and acting in productions. During the Great Depression, the Dil Pickle Club began to experience its decline. By the early 1930s, the club was being frequented more by Chicago mobsters rather than the usual free-minded Bohemian attendees. Soon the club would lose its unique taste and personality as rent rates in Chicago were rising. Tax difficulties in 1933 would be the end of the Dil Pickle Club. Despite Jones' efforts to save the club—which included the sale of the wooden Du Dil Duck toy—the Dil Pickle Club closed in 1934. Jones struggled financially thereafter until his death in 1940. Jack Sheridan, who had been attending the Dil Pickle Club since boyhood, tried to revive the club in 1944 in Tooker Alley premises, but the building was condemned as unsafe. Characteristics The Dill Pickle Club and Lending Library art (date unknown). The Dil Pickle Club was almost hidden from the outside and was considered a \\"hole in the wall\\" in Tooker Alley. The entrance was marked by a \\"DANGER\\" sign that which pointed to the orange main door which was lit by a green light. On the door, it read: \\"Step High, Stoop Low and Leave Your Dignity Outside.\\" Once inside, another sign read \\"Elevate Your Mind to a Lower Level of Thinking\\" before you entered the main part of the club. Immediately inside was a large main room with a stage. The room was decorated with brightly painted chairs and partially surrounded by counters where drinks and sandwiches were sold. The rest of the club was also decorated by its attendees and contained a tearoom and art exhibitions. Altogether, the club had reported standing capacity for 700 people. Popular attendees The club was frequented by many radical American activists, political speakers and authors. It was accepting of homosexuals. Among the American activists and speakers was Clarence Darrow, Emma Goldman, Big Bill Haywood, Hippolyte Havel, Lucy Parsons, Ben Reitman and Nina Spies. American authors included Pulitzer Prize winner Upton Sinclair along with Sherwood Anderson, Carl Sandburg, Ben Hecht, Vachel Lindsay, Djuna Barnes, William Carlos Williams, Kenneth Rexroth and Vincent Starrett. Other common attendees were poet, writer and Wobbly, Slim Brundage, speaker Martha Biegler, speaker Elizabeth Davis, artist Stanislav Szukalski, Harry Wilson and egoist F. M. Wilkesbarr (aka Malfew Seklew). A club for people with ideas and questions, it often attracted a mixed crowd. Scientists, panhandlers, prostitutes, socialists, anarchists, con men, tax advocates, religious zealots, social workers and hoboes were commonly at the club. Chicagoan George Wellington \\"Cap\\" Streeter was also said to have visited and spoken at the Dil Pickle Club.Selzer, Adam.

Robert Wood, an artist, was tried for the murder of prostitute Emily Dimmock and acquitted after a defence by Edward Marshall Hall.Januszczak, Waldemar. \\"Walter Sickert - murderous monster or sly self-promoter?\\" The Times, 4 November 2007. Retrieved 13 September 2008.Edward Marjoribanks, Famous Trials of Marshall Hall, Penguin, 1989. On 11 September 1907, Emily Dimmock (known as Phyllis), a part-time prostitute in a relationship with Bertram Shaw, a railwayman, was murdered in her home at Agar Grove (then 29 St Paul's Road), Camden, having gone there from The Eagle public house, Royal College Street.Wendy Baron, Sickert: paintings and drawings, Yale University Press, 2006, , p.73 Her attacker had slit her throat while she was asleep, then left in the morning. On the 12th, Shaw returned home during the evening to find his room locked. He borrowed a key from a neighbour, and upon entering found Phyllis lying naked on the bed, throat cut from ear to ear. It was a savage but skilful attack on her from the nature of the wound. Nothing much had been taken from the flat, and the motive was a mystery; the case quickly became a sensation. After initial difficulty, the police investigation led by Inspector Neill centred on Robert Wood, an artist. A former girlfriend of Wood's, Ruby Young, recognised his handwriting on a postcard found in Dimmock's room, which had been published in many newspapers; she mentioned the similarity of the handwriting to a friend who worked in Fleet Street. Wood was put on trial for the murder, during which Marshall Hall displayed the kind of effective and dramatic cross-examination that he was known for. Marshall Hall was convinced of Wood's innocence, and also of the fallibility of the prosecution case. The judge Mr Justice Grantham departed from the pro-conviction stance he was expected to take mid-summing up, and made it clear he thought the jury should acquit. They did, after retiring for 15 minutes between 7.45 and 8pm. The artist Walter Sickert adopted the phrase The Camden Town Murder for a series of etchings, paintings and drawing in 1908–9, in each of which the subjects are a clothed man and a nude woman. A television series, Killer in Close-Up, dramatised by George F. Kerr, featured the case in the episode \\"The Robert Wood Trial\\". The episode was produced by Sydney television station ABN-2 and broadcast on 4 September 1957. More than thirty years later, the court case featured in an episode of the BBC series Shadow of the Noose in 1989, with Jonathan Hyde as Marshall Hall, and Peter Capaldi as Wood.

The organization provides \\"free\\" apprenticeships, ministry resources and alternative approaches to mission, discipleship and Bible study. Paul Clayton Gibbs founded the organization in Manchester, Great Britain. Gibbs initiated partnerships that lead to the beginning of the Pais Project in 1992. Pais Project evolved into what is currently known as the Pais Movement incorporating communities, schools, universities and business relationships worldwide. Beginning with one team of young people led by Paul Gibbs in Manchester in 1992, Pais has grown into multiple teams and headquarters on six continents. The first team outside of Europe was started in Arlington, Texas, U.S.A. in 2002. Subsequently, several teams were established in Ireland, Germany, Canada, Ghana, Brazil, India, Pakistan, Kenya, Australia, Nigeria and New Zealand. History Pais Movement National Directors. 2015. Pais GB Established 1992. In 1992, as a result of connections that were made with various local schools and Sharon Church, Moston, Manchester where Gibbs was based, the first Pais team was initiated. The team consisted of four apprentices who taught lessons and led assemblies, primarily to students from 11–16 years old. As the Pais Project grew, it offered a professional training program and as more applications were received from prospective apprentices, the Pais Project extended across England until in 2000 it pioneered its first team in Northern Ireland. In 2009 it moved its headquarters from Manchester to Burnley where Pais GB is currently based at Life Church, Burnley. Pais Project Pais Ireland Established 2000. In 2000 Pais started its first team based in Coleraine. Due to being well received and its non-denominational stance, it enabled the teams to establish a rapport with both Protestant and Roman Catholic schools and youth groups. Their aim was to bring unity within the communities employing a relational approach. In 2010 Pais teams started to work in Cork. Pais Ireland currently has its headquarters in Portrush. Pais USA Established 2002. In 2002 the first Pais nation outside of Europe was established. Pais USA received a special endorsement from Max Lucado, an American best-selling author, writer, and preacher. Pais USA is based in Arlington, Texas with various teams working in schools and youth groups throughout the country. Pais Germany Established 2003. A wide range of opportunities arose for Pais Germany following the “PISA shock” when German schools were criticized for their comparatively poor performance in relation to their global counterparts. Pais Germany has a unique relationship with the German government. The government fully supports the organization and a year spent as a Pais apprentice is considered as a Voluntary social year. Pais Germany headquarters are in Neumünster. Pais Global Established 2005. In October 2005, following Gibbs's relocation to the US, the organization had grown to such an extent that a specialist team was launched as a resource center for the worldwide Pais Teams. The headquarters are in Arlington, Texas. Pais Ghana Pais Ghana cleaning a marketplace in Accra. March 2015. Established 2008. In 2008 the Pais Project extended into Africa. Apprentices mainly work in schools in the capital city of Ghana although teams have also partnered with local churches, hospitals, and orphanages in the neighboring rural areas. Pais Ghana headquarters are in Accra. Pais Brazil Pais Rio Grande do Norte work alongside medical staff in the 'favelas' in Brazil. 2014. Established 2012. In 2012 Pais began in South America, working alongside the local church in the schools and heavily populated urban slums known as 'favelas’. Pais Brazil has its headquarters in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte. Pais India Pais India member Established 2013. Pais India was established in 2013 by an Indian Pais apprentice who had trained for two years with Pais GB. He returned to India in July 2013 and started Pais India with various colleagues, reaching schools and campuses surrounding Chennai. Pais Pakistan Established 2013. The organization has released little information about its work in Pakistan for the security of its staff and apprentices. Pais Kenya Established 2014. Pais Kenya was launched in 2014. It was initially established in Nairobi and grew to other cities, such as Zimmerman, where it extended its work in local schools and youth groups. Pais Australia Established 2015. The extension of Pais into Australia takes the Movement into its sixth continent. Pais Australia is currently based in Brisbane. Rest of the World Pais also works in other nations primarily through specialist trainers and teachers. Europe has been its main focus with Pais establishing an influence in Estonia, Norway and other European countries through training at conferences and event-driven networks. Nations such as Spain have received more comprehensive input via full-time specialist teachers that have partnered with the churches and helped them launch Pais style youth ministries. Future Nations The vision of the Pais Movement is to further extend its work globally with plans of launching teams in Canada, Nigeria and the Netherlands. Founder Paul Clayton Gibbs. Founding Director of the Pais Movement. Paul Clayton Gibbs is the founder and global director of the Pais Movement. Born in Manchester, Great Britain, he is married to Lynn and has two boys, Joel and Levi. Gibb's early career was in retail management but he later decided to commit himself to working full-time at his local church. He established contacts with local schools which eventually led to the concept of the Pais Project being launched in 1992. The Pais Project was established as an inter-denominational youth and schools ministry. Gibbs worked as a youth leader within his local church and directed Pais teams in the area. In the mid-1990s, Gibbs became a Director with Youth Alive. During this time, he pioneered Youthlink, a national training curriculum, and assisted with other local projects. In 2000, Gibbs became the Senior Minister at the faith works in Failsworth, Oldham, a church that partnered with The Message Trust and planted the Eden Project, an award-winning community endeavor. In 2004, Gibbs launched his own Mentoring Academy and in October 2005 moved to the US, where he served on the Senior Leadership Team of a Texan megachurch. In 2009, Gibbs committed himself full-time to the development of Pais, launching various initiatives and resources such as mypais.com and Livewire, a weekly training video. Gibbs teaches throughout the world on topics which include pioneering, leadership development and the Kingdom of God. His books are published by Harris House Publishing. Gibbs is best known for his ability to combine ancient methods of discipleship with a communication style that is particularly suited to a post-modern society. He has gained national recognition in the UK and has written courses for, and spoken at various Bible colleges and seminaries in the UK and the States, such as Mattersey Hall, Nazarene Theological College (England) and Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. Apprenticeships The Pais Movement offers \\"free\\" apprenticeships. The apprenticeship includes training, accommodation & meals. The training consists of 200 lecture hours, 1,800 experiential training and is valued at a total of 10,400 American dollars. Upon successful completion apprentices receive a recognized certificate or the possibility of upgrading to a diploma or a degree. Within the free apprenticeships that are available Pais offers two distinctive packages, each with the possibility of minoring in specialized tracks; Youth & Campus Leadership, where apprentices are disciplined in three distinctives and trained to become missionaries within their school and community. They may choose to specialize in the areas of music, sport or theatre (dance, drama, mime). Organizational & Resource Management, where apprentices are trained to use the structure and systems of a non-profit organization to equip and release missionaries. The Organizational and Resource Management apprenticeship offers minors in communication, finance, media, personnel and training.

Films Released by Windward Productions, The Spirit of a Pioneer is a documentary based on the book ‘The Line and the Dot’ by Paul Clayton Gibbs. It tells the story of young adventurers who give their lives to touch the hearts of young people. The film was produced to inspire and inform those with a dream to make a difference in the world. Growth and Affiliate Ventures Pais has worked with schools, churches, orphanages and other agencies for twenty years. In that time it has grown from a local schools project to an internationally based organization of autonomous and independently run national organizations on six continents. The Pais Project is its most established department but more recently Pais Collective, Pais Venture, and Pais Infrastructure have also been launched. Pais Collective Pais Collective Established in 2012, Pais Collective bridges the gap and empowers relationship for the mutual benefit of both the church and the community. With headquarters in the USA it trains, equips, mentors and resources church pastors in addition to offering a free apprenticeship in Church & Community Leadership. Pais Collective offers church leaders not only a team of apprentices but also the option to access a training package including one-to-one mentoring and on-site visits. They can also access specific training packages classified under the headings: Consultancy, Conferences, and Resources. Pais Venture Pais Venture Pais Venture was recently established as the third wing of the Pais Movement. It aims to equip people in the workplace in three main areas. Firstly, it offers businesses with a desire to positively impact the world, both consultation, and training in the specific areas of Pais expertise. Secondly, it promotes, inspires and equips people in the area of faith transition at work. Thirdly, it offers a Pais apprenticeship in business and entrepreneurial skills. In addition to providing consultancy, integration, and apprentices, they have developed a Collaborative Social Responsibility (CSR) Program for businesses. This program not only provides tools for cause marketing but input as to how the business can successfully incorporate the entire CSR program for maximum success both internally for their employees and externally for their customers. Pais Infrastructure Pais Infrastructure After requests from organizations to provide logistical staff, Pais created Pais Infrastructure. It trains people in 5 areas of support work for NGO's and non-profit organizations. Apprentices are offered five skills sets to choose from; communication, training, human resources, finance and multi-media.

Mankiewicz. It follows a Royal Air Force World War II veteran (Rex Harrison) who goes to prison and then escapes and meets a woman who persuades him to surrender. The screenplay by Philip Dunne was based on the 1926 play Escape by John Galsworthy, which had previously been filmed in 1930.. Plot A former RAF squadron leader, Matt Denant goes to Hendley, England to visit an airfield run by Titch, a friend. An employee there named Rodgers asks if he would kindly make a large wager for him on a horse. Denant does, but when the horse loses, Rodgers makes a promise to repay him. While strolling through Hyde Park, a woman strikes up a conversation with Matt, only to be charged with unlawful soliciting by Penter, a detective. Matt intervenes on her behalf, but when the two men fight, Penter's head strikes a park bench. Matt is placed under arrest. He is then sentenced to three years in prison after Penter dies. Believing it an unjust punishment, Matt escapes. Inspector Harris of Scotland Yard is assigned to find him, while Matt takes refuge in the home of Sir James Winton, whose daughter Dora helps him hide. An aeroplane is left for Matt by his friend, enabling him to flee to France, but he is betrayed by Rodgers once it's learned the police are offering a reward. Matt's aeroplane is caught in a heavy fog and crashes. He survives and takes refuge in a farm. Dora finds him and professes her love, also persuading Matt that he must turn himself in to the law.

Weiler of the New York Times wrote a positive review of the film, \\"As the harried convict, Rex Harrison gives a restrained but persuasive portrait of a man beset not only by physical but moral tribulations ... The pace of Escape, as set by director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, is, on occasion, slower than might be desired, and scenarist Philip Dunne's script is sometimes given to lengthy conversation. But these are minor flaws in an adult work, which unspectacularly and effectively does justice to a serious theme.Weiler, A.H. The New York Times, film review, August 16, 1948. Accessed: August 13, 2013. Similarly, critic Craig Butler appreciated the film, writing, \\"Mankiewicz does a very good job of emphasizing the script's strong points, and he uses a number of interesting visual touches to keep things lively during discussions of morality and other weighty issues ... For his part, Harrison is in top form, finding multiple levels to play in dialogue that could easily devolve into rants and providing the kind of solid performance that is crucial to anchoring a film of this type. Neither he nor Mankiewicz can overcome the limitations of the script to make Escape a classic, but they do make it fairly engrossing.\\"Butler, Craig. Allmovie by Rovi, film review, no date.

It is an endemic species of the Iberian Peninsula. It bears rose-pink flowers about 12 cm wide and glossy green leaves. It reaches up to in height. Its common name in Portugal is rosa-albardeira, and in Spain albardera and matagallinas (also used for Daphne gnidium and Solanum dulcamara).  Description  Paeonia broteri is a perennial, herbaceous plant of 30–80 cm in height. It is a diploid species with ten chromosomes (2n=10).  Roots, stems and leaves  It has carrot-shaped roots up to 3 cm thick, from which the plant regrows early in spring, when conditions are best for plant growth in its home range. It also has thin lateral roots. Its stems are often tinged purple. Its leaves consist of three sets of mostly three leaflets, which may be deeply incised themselves, resulting in ten to thirty oval or longish oval segments (1½-5 or rarely up to 6½ cm wide), with a wedge-shaped foot, a more or less pointy tip, shiny bright green upper surface, and a (nearly) hairless, distinctly blue- green underside. Paeonia seeds  Flowers, fruits and seeds  The flowers are set individually at the top of the stems, are mostly subtended by one or two bracts looking like a leaf segment, and may be up to 15–16 cm in diameter. It has three, sometimes four, sepals, green with a purple margin, of approximately 3 cm long and 2½ cm wide, with rounded tips. There are five or six magenta or pinkish magenta petals, each 5–6 cm long and 3–4 cm wide. Numerous stamens consist of cream-colored, yellowish or purple filaments topped with yellow anthers. There are mostly two or three (occasionally one or four, rarely five) carpels covered in 2 mm long rust-colored hairs, with at their tips very short red stigmas of 2½ mm wide, their base encircled by a 2 mm high disk. The fruit consists of two to three (seldom one or four) follicles, each of which is up to 2½-4 cm high, and is covered in dense felty hairs which persist when fully grown. In its home range, this species has flowers from late March to May, but in The Netherlands flowering occurs in June and early July. The seeds are about 7–8 mm in size, reddish at first but blackish when ripe.  Differences with related species  Paeonia broteri is closely related to Paeonia clusii and shares the same characters except for the different average numbers of leaflet segments: 11-32 in P. broteri, 23-48 in P. clusii subsp. rhodia and 23-96 in P. clusii subsp. clusii. P. broteri also looks like the sympatric P. coriacea, but this species can be distinguished by its hairless carpels and wider leaflet segments (2–8 cm). P. mascula may also be confused with P. broteri, but this has only ten to eighteen (seldom up to twenty one) and larger (4½–18 × 3–9 cm) leaflet segments, while its carpels are mostly hairless and if present the hairs are about 2 mm long, whereas the densely hairy carpels of P. broteri carry hairs about 3 mm long. The distinctiveness of P. coriacea and P. mascula from P. broteri is confirmed by their tetraploidy (2n=20), while P. broteri is a diploid.  Etymology  The species was named in honor of the Portuguese botanist Félix Avelar Brotero.  Distribution  Paeonia broteri naturally occurs in the Portuguese areas Algarve, Beira Alta, Beira Baixa, Beira Litoral, Estremadura, Ribatejo, and Trás-os-Montes, and the Spanish provinces and regions Albacete, Ávila, Cádiz, Ciudad Real, Granada, Huelva, Jaén, Madrid, Málaga, Murcia, Salamanca, Toledo and Zamora. Two specimens claimed to be from northern Morocco are probably from Spain.  Ecology  In the wild, P. broteri flowers between April and early June. Seeds become ripe in August or September. It grows in meadows, pastures and in the undergrowth of schrubs, pine and oak forests on well-matured soils on limestone, at an altitude between 300 and 1800 m. It is also common in rocky places and screes, particularly in humid spots. It grows together with Adonis vernalis, Cytisus reverchonii, Quercus rotundifolia, Pinus nigra, Pinus pinaster, and Polygonatum odoratum. Plants that grow in different regions vary in the number of flowers per plant, in petal size, the number of stamens per flower, and the number of ovules in each carpel. These differences are related to the dominant pollinators, such as honey bees and bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) in the Sierra de Cazorla and smaller halictid bees in the Sierra de Jaén.

He was an important presence in the Canadian folk music scene from the mid-1970s up until his death in 1995. He worked both as a solo artist and as a member of the Friends of Fiddler's Green, a ceilidh band based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He was married to writer and musician Caroline Balderston Parry.[ Biography of David Parry at allmusic.com] Their son Richard Reed Parry (born 1977) is a member of the rock band Arcade Fire and their daughter Evalyn Parry is a prominent spoken-word performer and musician. Born in London, England, Parry received his formal training in theater, ultimately earning a Ph.D. in historical drama. He began his career as a stage actor in England during the early 1960s. He soon moved into directing plays as well and also began working as a semi- professional musician. During the 1960s and early 1970s he acted in and directed plays in England, Europe, India, and North America. In the mid-'70s, Parry moved with his wife to Toronto, where he began playing solo dates as a singer and storyteller. He soon became a fixture on Toronto's folk scene. He became a member of the Toronto Morris Men and then later joined the Friends of Fiddler's Green in the early 1980s. He also occasionally performed in concerts with Ian Robb. Parry released two solo albums: Wind That Tramps the World (1985) and The Man From Eldorado: Songs and Stories of Robert W. Service (1993). He was also heavily featured on the Friends of Fiddler's Green albums This Side of the Ocean (1981) and Road to Mandalay (1994). A posthumous album E Liked It All! (1995) was released when Parry died of a sudden heart attack at the age of 52. In addition to his work as a musician, Parry was on the staff of the Canadian Museum of Civilization where he was the director of the live interpretation program. He was also an adjunct faculty member of the drama department at the University of Toronto where he led Poculi Ludique Societas, a medieval drama group.David Parry (1942-1995)-Ave atque vale, The Canadian Folk Music Bulletin, 1995 References Category:1942 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Canadian male stage actors Category:Canadian theatre directors Category:Canadian folk musicians Category:University of Toronto faculty Category:Male actors from London Category:20th-century Canadian male actors Category:20th-century Canadian musicians Category:Parry family (Canada) ","title":"David Parry (folk musician)"},{"id":"26179893","title":"2010 Copa BBVA-Colsanitas"},{"id":"26179899","text":"Floyd Smith is professional hockey player.

At the end of the Little Ice Age about 1850, the area containing the national park had 150 glaciers. There are 25 active glaciers remaining in the park today. Since the latest interglacial period began 10,000 years ago, there have been regular climate shifts causing periods of glacier growth or melt-back. The glaciers are currently being studied to see the effect of global warming. The glaciers in the park have been in a general state of retreat since at least the year 1850, which is oftentimes cited as the end of the Little Ice Age, when midlatitude glaciers reached their largest historical maximum. Though believed in the early 2000s that most of the glaciers in the park would disappear by the year 2020, more recent studies now give the year 2030 as a more likely date for this disappearance. A study done in 2003 on two glaciers indicated they would be completely gone by the year 2030, though some other glaciers may remain as small isolated ice bodies for a longer duration. * Agassiz Glacier - ; * Ahern Glacier - ; Black and white photo of Grinnell Glacier, Glacier National Park, Montana.

Summary The Terrorist Asset-Freezing (Temporary Provisions) Act 2010 is an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament to make provision for the temporary validity of certain Orders in Council imposing financial restrictions on, and in relation to, persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activity; and for connected purposes. These Orders in Council had been the chosen method of implementation of Resolution 1373 and the directives of the 1267 Committee. The legislation was introduced in the House of Commons on 5 February 2010 and received royal assent on 10 February. Judgment The Act was passed following the HM Treasury v Ahmed ruling by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom on 27 January 2010 that asset-freezing orders made under the United Nations Act 1946 – specifically the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2009, the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006, the Al-Qa’ida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2002, the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2001 and the Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 – were unlawful, because the 1946 Act was not intended to authorise coercive measures which interfere with fundamental rights without parliamentary scrutiny:supremecourt.uk: HM Treasury v Ahmed, etc, 27 Jan 2010 (vide Lord Hope at para.16) Multiple persons, multiple orders and a forest of laws, Statutory Orders and UNSC resolutions were considered in the judgment. The applicants pleaded variously that the Treasury Orders were ultra vires for various reasons: * illegality because it was passed without Parliamentary approval, * lack of legal certainty and proportionality, * the absence of procedures that enabled designated persons to challenge their designation, * by virtue of section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 because they were incompatible with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and with article 1 of Protocol 1 of the ECHR, * violated client's right of access to a court for an effective remedy. Lord Phillips concluded that Legislation When the court refused to stay its judgement on 4 February, the 2010 Act was passed to retrospectively validate the orders until Parliament could pass new asset-freezing legislation which complied with the court's judgement.UK Supreme Court website (see 27 January 2010 cases) Speaking in the House of Commons on 8 February, Liberal Democrat MP David Heath said of the bill: Repeal The Act was repealed by the Terrorist Asset-Freezing etc. Act 2010,legislation.gov.uk: PGA, 2010 c.38 a full legislative text with which to implement Resolution 1373.

He is mainly known for his history paintings and portraits but he also painted allegories and genre scenes.Carel van Savoyen at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life Venus and Adonis on a dolphin The artist was born in Antwerp. He was the older brother of Philips van Savoy (or 'Philips van Savoyen') who was also a painter and later was active in Amsterdam.Philips van Savoy at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He was registered in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke as a pupil of the history and portrait painter Jan Cossiers in 1634-35. He left for Italy where he stayed in Rome in the period from 1643 to 1645.Carel van Savoyen, An elegant couple courting in a formal garden at Galerie Jan de Maere The artist was recorded in Amsterdam on 20 April 1649 when he marries Catharina Wandelman, the daughter of a wealthy Catholic merchant in Amsterdam.Robert Schillemans, Altarpieces by Carel van Savoy and Nicolaes Roosendael, in: Hoogsteder Mercury Journal 13-14 He stated at the time that he was 28 years of age. He became citizen (poorter) of Amsterdam on 1 September 1649. He is known to have worked on two large paintings, both dated 1659, for churches in the Northern Netherlands. That Carel van Savoyen received the commission for these two altarpieces may have had something to do with the connections of his wife's wealthy Catholic family, which made him the brother-in-law of an Amsterdam priest. The prestige of Flemish art with the Amsterdam elite of the day may also have played a role. Portrait of a boy One of his paintings representing Venus and Adonis was reportedly the subject of a poem by the Dutch poet Jan Vos.Karel van Savoyen biography in: Arnold Houbraken, De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen, 1718 His work was also lavishly praised in Cornelis de Bie's 1662 book of artist biographies entitled Het Gulden Cabinet.Cornelis de Bie, Het gulden cabinet van de edel vry schilderconst, Antwerp, 1622, pp. 369–369 This shows that his work was held in high esteem by other artists of his time. Subsequently it fell, however, into oblivion. He remained active in Amsterdam until his death in 1665. Work Carel van Savoyen's small extant oeuvre comprises only a dozen portraits and history pieces. He was known for his paintings of religious and mythological subjects as well as for his portraits. In the text underneath the selfportrait of Carel van Savoyen, which was included in Cornelis de Bie's Het Gulden Cabinet, the artist is described as being skilled at painting small figures, mainly of nude women. Carel van Savoyen also painted genre scenes such as the composition An elegant couple courting in a formal garden (signed, formerly at Galerie Jan de Maere). This painting depicts an elegantly dressed man offering a flower to a lady sitting at a table in a garden with classical statues. An Interior with a Music Party (oil on canvas, Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, Glasgow), currently attributed by the museum to 'circle of Gillis van Tilborch' is likely also by the hand of Carel van Savoyen. In this painting the lady holding a music score and the man standing behind the harpsichord appear to be the same as the two figures depicted in the signed An elegant couple courting in a formal garden. The judgement of Paris A near-contemporary Amsterdam inventory also lists an allegory by his hand. An example of an allegorical painting by van Savoyen is the composition entitled An allegory of abundance (Signed and dated 1651, at Jean Moust).Carel van Savoyen, An allegory of abundance at Jean Moust During his period of activity in Antwerp van Savoyen followed the style of his master Jan Cossiers and of the important portrait painter Gonzales Coques. In Amsterdam his work became influenced by local artists such as Rembrandt and Gerard de Lairesse. His portrait drawing of Frans Koerten was engraved by Theodor Matham. A painting by Carel van Savoyen of Jan de Doot holding a kidney stone in the shape of an egg hangs in the Portrait Collection of the Laboratory of Pathology, which is part of the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. The story behind the painting is that Jan de Doot, a Dutch blacksmith, reported to have performed a successful kidney stone removal on himself in 1651.Een zieke zichzelf van de steen snijdende in Observationes Medicae on Google books Carel van Savoyen works can be found in the Hessisches Landesmuseum in Darmstadt, the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Bordeaux, the Greek orthodox chapel in Leipzig and in the old Catholic church of Zaandam.

The basic assumption of the theory is that a deviation from equilibrium between the molecular friction and thermodynamic interactions leads to the diffusion flux.S. Rehfeldt, J. Stichlmair: Measurement and calculation of multicomponent diffusion coefficients in liquids, Fluid Phase Equilibria, 2007, 256, 99–104 The molecular friction between two components is proportional to their difference in speed and their mole fractions. In the simplest case, the gradient of chemical potential is the driving force of diffusion. For complex systems, such as electrolytic solutions, and other drivers, such as a pressure gradient, the equation must be expanded to include additional terms for interactions. A major disadvantage of the Maxwell–Stefan theory is that the diffusion coefficients, with the exception of the diffusion of dilute gases, do not correspond to the Fick's diffusion coefficients and are therefore not tabulated. Only the diffusion coefficients for the binary and ternary case can be determined with reasonable effort. In a multicomponent system, a set of approximate formulas exist to predict the Maxwell–Stefan- diffusion coefficient. The Maxwell–Stefan theory is more comprehensive than the \\"classical\\" Fick's diffusion theory, as the former does not exclude the possibility of negative diffusion coefficients. It is possible to derive Fick's theory from the Maxwell–Stefan theory.

After graduating from Brown University, Lippitt, who could speak and read French fluently, was hired by Alexis de Tocqueville to read the American pamphlets that he had collected during his visit to the United States and summarize them in French. To California with the New York Regiment In 1846 Lippitt was made a captain of Stevenson's 1st Regiment of New York Volunteers for service in California and during the war with Mexico during the Mexican War.Captain Jim Balance, Stevenson's Regiment: First Regiment of New York Volunteers, The California Military Museum In 1847. he served as captain commanding the garrison in Santa Barbara, California. After mustering out in 1848, he remained in the territory and was afterwards a member of the California Constitutional Convention, held in Monterey, California in 1849. Civil War and the Bald Hills War In 1861 Lippitt raised the 2nd California Infantry Regiment and served as its colonel. As such he was made the first commander of the Humboldt Military District between January 9, 1862 and July 13, 1863. He was tasked with prosecuting the Bald Hills War against the Indians in the counties of northwestern California. Under his command several posts were established as bases for operations against the Indians and for the defense of the settlers. He was relieved on July 13, 1863 by Lieutenant Colonel Stephen G. Whipple of the 1st Battalion California Volunteer Mountaineers, who advocated a more active prosecution of the war with men used to the hardships of war in the redwood forests. Colonel Lippitt and his regimental headquarters was transferred to Benicia Barracks, July 20, 1863, and from there to Fort Miller, Fresno County, California, August 11, 1863, where they were stationed until October 1, 1864. They returned to the Presidio of San Francisco, October 9, 1864. There during the month of October 1864, Colonel Lippitt was mustered out with men of his regiment who had completed their terms of enlistment. He was made brevet brigadier general, March 13, 1865, for faithful service during the war. Later life Following the civil War, General Lippitt wrote four military books, A Treatise on the Tactical Use of The Three Arms, Infantry, Artillery, and Cavalry in 1865, A treatise on intrenchments in 1866, The Special Operations of War: comprising the forcing and defence of defiles; the forcing and defence of rivers in retreat; the attack and defence of open towns and villages; the conduct of detachments for special purposes; and notes on tactical operations in sieges in 1868, and Field service in war: Comprising marches, camps and cantonments, outposts, convoys, reconnaissances, foraging, and notes on logistics in 1869. He became interested in spiritualism and wrote Physical Proofs of Another Life in 1888. In 1902 he published his autobiography, Reminiscences of Francis J.

It is occasionally present as an impurity in street heroin and is typically created when attempting to create heroin from a solution of morphine in which some of the codeine from the original opium solution still remains. It is formed either through the addition of acetic anhydride, which can only acetylate the 6 position on the codeine or as a result of the addition of acetic acid with a catalyst in an attempt to create 6-monoacetylmorphine, the equivalent ester of morphine which is slightly more potent than heroin itself. 6-monoacetylcodeine is eventually metabolised into codeine and then into morphine. Since only illegally produced heroin is likely to contain 6-MAC, testing for the presence of it in the urine can be used as a fairly reliable method of detecting the use of illicit heroin, as opposed to prescription painkillers. 6-MAC is the precursor for 14-hydroxycodeinenone which was the original precursor to oxycodone. The 7-8 double-bond was reduced using the hyposulfite ion to reduce the 6-7 double-bond. While the acute toxicity of 6-monoacetylcodeine has not been studied in man, animal studies have shown that in animal models its convulsant effects have been proved and when mixed with mono- or di- acetyl morphine, lowers the convulsant threshold of the mixture still further.

Indigenous peoples around the world used earth ovens for thousands of years. In modern times the term and activity is often associated with the Eastern Seaboard, the \\"barbecue belt\\", colonial California in the United States and Mexico. The meats usually barbecued in a pit in these contexts are beef, pork, and goat. California Throughout the New World the indigenous peoples of the Americas cooked in the earth for millennia. The original use of buried cooking in pits in North America was done by the Native Americans for thousands of years, including by the tribes of California. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries eras, when the territory became Spanish Las Californias and then Mexican Alta California, the Missions and ranchos of California had large cattle herds for hides and tallow use and export. At the end of the culling and leather tanning season large pit barbecues cooked the remaining meat. In the early days of California statehood after 1850 the Californios continued the outdoor cooking tradition for fiestas. Traditional Californian pit barbecuing is not done often in contemporary times, due to needing space and labor to dig a pit, significant firewood requirements, and air quality concerns. However, in 2007 the 'Culinary Historians of Southern California' recreated an Early California pit barbecue on the grounds of the Mexican Rancho San Jose, at the Ygnacio Palomares Adobe in Pomona. It required burning hundreds of pounds of wood in the pit over the preceding night, then lowering cloth-wrapped, marinated meat into the resulting pit of coals and covering everything with earth. After cooking all night, participants pronounced the results \\"incredibly tender, deeply smoky meat.\\" A traditional Horno was used for baking. The Santa Maria Style BBQ, originally from the Central Coast of California, uses a portable 'towed' trailer version frequently seen at farmers markets. Eastern seaboard Pit barbecuing is also popular along the Eastern Seaboard of the U.S. The buried version of the New England clam bake is one example. In Maryland it is done at large \\"bull roasts\\" in the summer season and \\"Bull & Oyster Roasts\\" in colder months. Maryland-style pit beef is not barbecue cookery in the strictest sense. Instead, it is typically cooked quickly over charcoal. The meat is typically served rare with a strong horseradish sauce as the condiment.  Southern- style pit barbecue  Pork ribs in a barbecue \\"pit\\", Memphis, Tennessee, USA A wood-fired barbecue pit at Wilber's Barbecue - Goldsboro, NC, USA Across the \\"barbecue belt\\" of the United States, pit barbecue can also refer to an enclosed, above-ground \\"pit\\" such as a horno or outdoor pizza oven. The method of cooking the meat is slowly, using various hardwoods to flavor the meat. This breaks down the connective tissue in the meats, producing a tender product. The types of meat cooked in this fashion include both beef and pork.\\"A Sociology of Rib Joints\\" by P. D. Holley and D. E.

Vaidehi is one of the most successful women writers in the language and a recipient of prestigious national and state- level literary awards.http://www.oup.co.in/search_detail.php?id=144737 She has won the Sahitya Akademi Award for her collection of short stories, Krauncha Pakshigalu in 2009. Biography Early life Vaidehi was born on 12 February 1945 to A. V. N. Hebbar (father) and Mahalakshmi (mother) in Kundapura taluk of Udupi district, Karnataka. She grew up in a large traditional Brahmin family. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in Commerce from the Bhandarkar College in Kundapura. Her father is a lawyer and her mother was a homemaker. At home, a dialect of Kannada called Kundapur Kannada is spoken and she uses this dialect in her works as well. Vaidehi became her pen-name under unusual circumstances. Early in her writing career, she had sent a story to the Kannada weekly magazine Sudha for publication but later requested the publisher not to go ahead with the print as the story was non- fictional and included a real-life story. However, the editor went ahead with the publication by changing the author's name to 'Vaidehi'. This name stuck in her later writings as well as she gained popularity. Married life Vaidehi married to K. L. Srinivasa Murthy at the age of 23. The couple have two daughters, Nayana Kashyap (née Nayana Murthy) and Pallavi Rao (née Pallavi Murthy). After marriage Vaidehi changed her legal name to Janaki Srinivasa Murthy and moved to Shivamogga. Later the family moved to Udupi and then to Manipal where she currently resides. Vaidehi's daughter Nayana Kashyap is a translator, Kannada writer and English teacher. She has translated some of the Vaidehi's works into English including five novels.

The Western Rocks are the archipelago in the lower left of this image. The Western Rocks are a group of uninhabited skerries and rocks in the south–western part of the Isles of Scilly, United Kingdom, and are renowned for the numerous shipwrecks in the area and the nearby Bishop Rock lighthouse. In 1971, the rocks and islands were designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest for their breeding sea birds. Landing on the islands is both difficult and discouraged and there are few published records of visits by naturalists. Nature reserve The islands are largely managed as nature reserves by the Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust, principally for breeding seabirds and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus). There are eleven species of breeding seabirds with the European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) and European storm petrel (Hydrobates pelagicus) of national importance. The other species are kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), razorbill (Alca torda), guillemot (Uria aalge), cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), puffin (Fratercula arctica), great black–backed gull (Larus marinus), lesser black–backed gull (Larus fuscus) and herring gull (Larus argentatus). The only breeding sites for European storm petrel in England are on the Isles of Scilly with eleven colonies and an estimated 1475 occupied sites (i.e. breeding pairs). Melledgan did have the third largest colony on Scilly with 140 occupied sites recorded during the Seabird 2000 survey declining to 69 occupied sites in a repeat survey in 2006. It was replaced by Roseveor in 2006 with 129 breeding pairs. Other Western Rock colonies are on Gorregan and Rosevean. Geography All of the Western Rocks are composed of Hercynian granite of late Carboniferous age with thin podzolic soils on the larger ones. They are located south-west of St Mary's, with Annet and St Agnes immediately to the north-east and the Bishop Rock to the west. The larger islands in this archipelago are, from north to south: Great Crebwethan, Rosevear, Rosevean, Daisy and Pednathise Head (the most southerly point of the United Kingdom). Rosevear Ledge and the Gilstone Reef are just to the west of this group. Smaller islands within the Western Rocks are: Codnors Rocks, Crebwethan, Jolly Rock, Jacky's Rock, Silver Carn, Gorregan and Melledgan.Ordnance Survey: Explorer map sheet 101 Isles of Scilly Individual islands and rocks View of the Western Rocks Gorregan Trenemene, seen from Gorregan Little Crebawethan Melledgan Rags Rosevear Some of the islands and rocks are listed below.

Gilstone () The Gilstone (Gilstone Reef or Gilstone Rock, for an image see here) is also known as Outer Gilstone Rock to distinguish it from a rock off Old Town Bay on St Mary's which is also called Gilstone. Gilstone has been the cause of many of the shipwrecks recorded in the Isles of Scilly, most notably the sinking of Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell's flagship in the naval disaster of 1707 with the loss of over 1400 lives. Gorregan (, the rock place) () in size. The smooth square fissured rocks of Gorregan ( high) is a contrast to the other islands which are a ″disordered jumble″ of rocks. The only plants recorded are common scurvygrass (Cochlearia officinalis), rock sea–spurry (Spergularia rupicola) and orache (Atriplex sp). The breeding colony of European storm petrel had 49 occupied sites recorded during the Seabird 2000 survey and there is a large colony of kittiwake, although in 1984 there was no breeding because of (possible) predation by carrion crow (Corvus corone) or common raven (Corvus corax). Other breeding birds are razorbill and guillemot. Grey seals use the island as a pupping site. Great Crebawethan (, reef of the tree) () in size. The island was surveyed for European storm petrel during the Seabird 2000 survey with none found. Hellweathers (, marsh ground) () A group of rocks to the south of Annet. Little Crebawethan () in size. Melledgan (, plant or herb stone) () in size. Melledgan was the site of the third largest colony of European storm petrel in England with 140 occupied sites recorded during the Seabird 2000 survey declining to 69 occupied sites in a repeat survey in 2006 and being replaced by Roseveor. Cormorant and shag also breed on the island and it is a main pupping and haul–out site for grey seal. The seals' droppings enrich the shingle plant community. Plants recorded are tree mallow (Lavatera arborea), spear–leaved orache (Atriplex prostrata) and common scurvygrass. Retarrier Ledges () Lying between the Bishop Rock to the north-west and Rosevean to the south- east, their claim to fame is loss of 335 lives when the German liner the SS Schiller hit the rocks in 1875. Rosevean (, little promontory) () in area and the highest of the Western Rocks with a maximum height of . Apart from the occasional plant Rosevean consists mainly of bare rocks and is important for its breeding birds and, as a haul–out site for grey seals.

The island was used as a base camp, during 1709 and 1710, for the Herbert salvage expedition which worked the wrecks of the Association and other vessels wrecked in 1707. In the 1840s and 1850s it was again inhabited by workmen, this time building the Bishop Rock lighthouse. The island has replaced Melledgan as the site of the third largest colony of European storm petrel in England with 57 occupied sites recorded during the Seabird 2000 survey increasing to 129 occupied sites in the repeat survey in 2006.

Navigation, especially in cloudy weather, was often an informed guess based on assumed speed and direction. With a poor understanding of the sea current, in the western approaches, which pushed sailing ships further north than expected, and the problem of pre–1750 charts showing the rocks a further ten miles north than they actually are, it is not surprising that throughout history the Western Rocks have witnessed a great number of the shipwrecks recorded in the Isles of Scilly.

Seventy–seven years later, in 1784, the packet ship Nancy hit the Gilstone. Some of the crew and passengers took to a small boat which was dashed on to Rosevear killing all those aboard. A total of 36 crew, 12 passengers, and 1 prisoner drowned including the infamous actress Ann Cargill. She was returning to England from India and her body was found clinging to a young child and they were buried on Rosevear along with other bodies found. She was later interred in the churchyard in Old Town on St Mary's. In 1841 the captain of a paddle steamer the SS Thames' mistook the lighthouse on St Agnes for the Longships, changed course to north and steamed onto the Cribewidden Rocks with the loss of 62 of the 66 passengers and crew. The second known heaviest loss of life occurred in 1875 when the German liner the SS Schiller hit the Retarrier Ledges with the loss of 335 lives. Her captain knew she was near the Bishop Light but didn't realise he was within the Western Rocks. The various wrecks are popular diving sites for both commercial and amateur divers with searches made to identify and record the wrecks.

A son of Al- Harith ibn Jabalah, he succeeded his father both in the kingship over his tribe and as the chief of the Byzantine Empire's Arab clients and allies in the East, with the rank of patricius. Despite his victories over the rival Persian-backed Lakhmids, throughout Mundhir's reign his relations with Byzantium were lukewarm due to his staunch Miaphysitism. This led to a complete breakdown of the alliance in 572, after Mundhir discovered Byzantine plans to assassinate him. Relations were restored in 575 and Mundhir secured from the Byzantine emperor both recognition of his royal status and a pledge of tolerance towards the Miaphysite Church. In 580 or 581, Mundhir participated in an unsuccessful campaign against the Persian capital, Ctesiphon, alongside the Byzantine general (and future emperor) Maurice. The failure of the campaign led to a quarrel between the two and Maurice accused Mundhir of treason. Byzantine agents captured Mundhir, who was brought to Constantinople but never faced trial. His arrest provoked an uprising among the Ghassanids under Mundhir's son al-Nu'man VI. When Maurice ascended the throne in 582, Mundhir was exiled to Sicily although, according to one source, he was allowed to return to his homeland after Maurice's overthrow in 602. Mundhir was the last important Ghassanid ruler; in 584, the Byzantines would break up the Ghassanid federation. A capable and successful military leader, his rule also saw the strengthening of Miaphysitism and a cultural flowering among the Arabs under his rule. Biography Succession and early career Mundhir was the son of al-Harith ibn Jabalah, ruler of the Ghassanid tribe and supreme phylarch of the Arab foederati in the eastern frontier of the Byzantine Empire.. Situated on the southern flank of the frontier, the Ghassanids faced the Lakhmids, another powerful Arab tribe who were in turn the chief client of Byzantium's main antagonist, the Sassanid Persian Empire.. Harith had been raised to the kingship and to the position of supreme phylarch by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565), who wished thereby to create a strong counterpart to the Lakhmid rulers.. Mundhir had been confirmed as his father's heir as early as 563, during the latter's visit to Constantinople, and succeeded after Harith's death in 569. It appears that Mundhir inherited his father's Byzantine titles one at a time, as they were not hereditary: the rank of patricius, the honorific appellation paneuphemos (most honorable) and the prestigious honorific gentilicum \\"Flavius\\", borne by the Byzantine emperors and consuls.. Soon after Harith's death, Ghassanid territory was attacked by Qabus ibn al-Mundhir, the new Lakhmid ruler, who sought to take advantage of the situation. Qabus's forces were repulsed and Mundhir invaded Lakhmid territory in turn, seizing much plunder. As he turned back, the Lakhmids again confronted the Ghassanid army, but suffered a heavy defeat... After this success, Mundhir wrote to the Byzantine emperor Justin II (r. 565–578) asking for gold for his men. This request reportedly angered Justin, who sent instructions to his local commander to lure the Ghassanid ruler into a trap and have him killed. But the letter fell into Mundhir's hands, who then severed his relations with the Empire and refused to commit his forces during the war with Persia that began in 572.. Return to Byzantine allegiance The Byzantine Diocese of the East, where the Ghassanids were active. As the Byzantines relied upon the Ghassanids to cover the approaches to Syria, Mundhir's withdrawal left a gap in the Byzantine southern flank, which persisted for three years until 575 when Mundhir returned to the Byzantine allegiance through the mediation of the general Justinian, who met Mundhir at Sergiopolis.. Immediately after this reconciliation, Mundhir assembled an army in secret and launched an attack against Hirah, the Lakhmid capital, arguably the Arab world's largest, richest, and most culturally vibrant city at the time.. The city was sacked, plundered, and put to the torch, except for the churches. According to John of Ephesus, Mundhir donated much of his booty from this expedition to monasteries and the poor.; . The same year, Mundhir visited Constantinople, where he was awarded a crown or diadem (stemma), marking the formal renewal of his role as Byzantium's chief Arab client-king.. The war with Persia was interrupted by a three-year truce agreed in 575. In 578, hostilities were renewed, but the sources on the period, fragmentary as they are, do not mention any Ghassanid participation for the first two years.. In 580, Mundhir was invited by Emperor Tiberius II (r. 578–582) to visit the capital again. He arrived in the city on 8 February, accompanied by two of his sons, and was lavishly received. On this occasion, among a multitude of other gifts, he was also presented with a royal crown, instead of the simpler coronet or diadem he had been awarded before..; . While at Constantinople, Mundhir received permission from the emperor to hold a Monophysite church council, which convened on 2 March 580. This council managed, albeit for a brief time, to reconcile the various factions and sects of the Monophysites. It was a goal towards which Mundhir had long striven, as when he intervened in the quarrel between Jacob Baradaeus and Paul the Black, the Monophysite patriarch of Antioch... Before leaving the imperial capital, the Ghassanid ruler also secured a pledge from the emperor that the persecutions of the Monophysites would cease. When he returned home, Mundhir discovered that the Lakhmids and Persians had used his absence to raid his domains. Gathering his forces, he fell upon their army, defeated them, and returned home laden with booty.. In the summer of 580 or 581, Mundhir went to Circesium on the river Euphrates, where he joined the Byzantine forces under the new magister militum per Orientem, Maurice, for a campaign deep into Persian territory.. The combined force moved south along the river, accompanied by a fleet of ships. The allied army stormed the fortress of Anatha and moved on until it reached the region of Beth Aramaye in central Mesopotamia, near the Persian capital of Ctesiphon, but there they found the bridge over the Euphrates destroyed by the Persians.; . With any possibility of a march to Ctesiphon gone, they were forced to retreat, especially since at the same time the Persian commander Adarmahan had taken advantage of the Byzantine army's absence and was raiding freely in Osroene, where he sacked the provincial capital Edessa. The retreat was arduous for the exhausted army, and Maurice and Mundhir exchanged recriminations for the expedition's failure. Mundhir and Maurice cooperated however in forcing Adarmahan to withdraw, and defeated him at Callinicum. Upon returning to his lands, Mundhir learned that a combined Persian-Lakhmid force was preparing another attack against the Ghassanid realm. Immediately he set out to meet them, engaged their army and comprehensively defeated it, before going on to capture the enemy camp. It was to be his last victory.. Arrest and exile Despite his successes, Mundhir was accused by Maurice of treason during the preceding campaign. Maurice claimed that Mundhir had revealed the Byzantine plan to the Persians, who then proceeded to destroy the bridge over the Euphrates. The chronicler John of Ephesus explicitly calls this assertion a lie, as the Byzantine intentions must have been plain to the Persian commanders... Both Maurice and Mundhir wrote letters to Emperor Tiberius, who tried to reconcile them. Finally, Maurice himself visited Constantinople, where he was able to persuade Tiberius of Mundhir's guilt. The charge of treason is almost universally dismissed by modern historians; Irfan Shahîd says that it probably had more to do with Maurice's dislike of the veteran and militarily successful Arab ruler. This was further compounded by the Byzantines' habitual distrust of the \\"barbarian\\" and supposedly innately traitorous Arabs, as well as by Mundhir's staunchly Monophysite faith.. Tiberius ordered Mundhir's arrest, and a trap was laid for the Ghassanid king: summoned to Constantinople to answer charges of treason, Mundhir chose his friend, the curator Magnus, as his advocate. Magnus was probably a Byzantine, hailing from Huwwarin (Evaria). There he had built a church, and he now called on Mundhir to join him and the patriarch of Antioch Gregory in the dedication ceremony.. Mundhir arrived with only a small escort and was arrested by Byzantine troops stationed in secret at the location. He was transported to Constantinople, joined along the way by his wife and three of his children. At the capital, he was treated well by Tiberius, who allowed him a comfortable residence and a subsidy, but denied him an audience.. Irfan Shahîd believes that this generous treatment, as well as the fact that he was not brought to trial for his supposed treason, indicate that Tiberius too did not believe the charges, but ordered the arrest chiefly to placate the strong anti-Monophysite faction in the imperial capital.. In the meantime, Mundhir's arrest provoked a revolt led by his four sons, especially the eldest, Nu'man, a man described by John of Ephesus as even more capable and warlike than his father. For two years, the Ghassanid army launched raids into the Byzantine provinces from their bases in the desert, even defeating and killing the Byzantine dux of Arabia in a battle at Bostra. Tiberius reacted by raising a Chalcedonian brother of Mundhir to the Ghassanid kingship.. A large army with Magnus at its head was dispatched east to counter Nu'man and install his uncle as king. The latter was swiftly done, but the new king died after only twenty days. Magnus also had some success in subduing or subverting the allegiance of some minor Arab tribes away from the Ghassanids. Magnus died shortly before Tiberius's own death in August 582, and with Maurice's accession to the throne, Nu'man journeyed to Constantinople to achieve a reconciliation with Byzantium. Instead, he too was arrested, tried, and sentenced to death, quickly commuted to house arrest.. Mundhir remained in Constantinople until the death of Tiberius and the accession of Maurice, when he was exiled to Sicily.. It is likely that he is the man Pope Gregory the Great mentioned as \\"Anamundarus\\" in 600, indicating that he was still alive at the time. A 13th- century Syriac chronicle further records that after Maurice's overthrow and murder in 602, Mundhir was allowed to return home.. Legacy Mundhir in many ways continued in the footsteps of his father. He was a militarily successful ally of the Byzantines, especially against his fellow Arabs, the Lakhmid tribesmen, and secured Byzantium's southern flank and its political and commercial interests in Arabia proper.. Despite his fervent dedication to Monophysitism, he remained loyal to Byzantium as the Christian state par excellence; as Irfan Shahîd comments, Mundhir's self-image may well have been that of a \\"sixth-century Odenathus fighting for the Christian Roman Empire, as his third-century predecessor had done for the pagan empire\\". Yet, in the end, his independent character and his role as the protector of the Monophysite Church led to his downfall and exile. In the overwhelmingly pro-Chalcedonian atmosphere of Tiberius's and Maurice's reigns, unlike his father Harith, who was protected by Empress Theodora's Monophysite leanings, Mundhir could not count on any influential support in Constantinople.; . Mundhir's arrest was followed after 584 by the dissolution of the Ghassanid federation into a number of smaller chiefdoms. This was a momentous event in the history of Byzantine-Arab relations: it destroyed Byzantium's \\"protective shield\\" against incursions from the Arabian desert, an error for which the Byzantines would pay dearly with the onset of the Muslim conquests. It was paralleled a few years later by the destruction of the Lakhmid kingdom at the hands of the Persians, opening a power vacuum in northern Arabia which the nascent Muslim state would later fill.; On the other hand, the Muslim conquests, and before them the destructive thirty-year war with Persia, were still a long way off in 584, and the dissolution of the Ghassanid federation may be seen simply, according to the historian Michael Whitby, as the elimination of an \\"over- successful quasi-client neighbour\\", who threatened to become \\"too powerful for the good of its supposed patron\\".. The Ghassanids left an important cultural legacy as well. Their patronage of the Monophysite Syrian Church was crucial for its survival and revival, and even its spread, through missionary activities, south into Arabia. According to the historian Warwick Ball, the Ghassanids' promotion of a simpler and more rigidly monotheistic form of Christianity in a specifically Arab context can be said to have anticipated Islam.; . Ghassanid rule also brought a period of considerable prosperity for the Arabs on the eastern fringes of Syria, as evidenced by a spread of urbanization and the sponsorship of several churches, monasteries and other buildings. The surviving descriptions of the Ghassanid courts impart an image of luxury and an active cultural life, with patronage of the arts, music and especially Arab-language poetry. In the words of Ball, \\"the Ghassanid courts were the most important centres for Arabic poetry before the rise of the Caliphal courts under Islam\\", and their court culture, including their penchant for desert palaces like Qasr ibn Wardan, provided the model for the Umayyad caliphs and their court.; . Among the architectural remains from Mundhir's own reign are the castle of Dumayr and the so-called ecclesia extra muros (nowadays identified as Mundhir's own audience hall or praetorium) in Sergiopolis, where an inscription in Greek, celebrating Mundhir, survives. Sergiopolis (modern Rusafa) was a site of particular significance due to the popularity of the cult of Saint Sergius among the Arabs, and was also a focus of later Umayyad building activity.; ; .On the audience hall of al-Mundhir, cf. ; References Citations Sources      Category:6th-century Christians Category:7th-century Christians Category:6th- century monarchs in the Middle East Category:7th-century deaths Category:Byzantine generals Category:Ghassanid kings Category:Patricii Category:People of the Roman–Sasanian Wars Category:Year of birth unknown Category:6th-century Arabs Category:7th-century Arabs Category:Arab Christians ","title":"Al-Mundhir III ibn al-Harith"},{"id":"26180319","text":"Ernst Freiherr von Althaus (19 March 1890 - 29 November 1946) was a German flying ace in World War I, credited with nine confirmed aerial victories, as well as eight unconfirmed ones.

Open to all students grades 6-12, Beehive’s focus is math, science and technology. Beehive has small class sizes, rigorous curriculum, dedicated faculty, individualized instruction and comprehensive college and career counseling. Beehive supports creative development through their art programs. History BSTA opened August 29, 2005 in Sugarhouse. In 2008 the school moved to its Murray campus, which was used until the beginning of the 2010-2011 school year. The stay in this facility was short because the building itself was inadequate and expensive. Beehive then moved to its current location in Sandy off of 9400 South and 700 E. Organization An eight-member school board governs BSTA. Board members are business leaders and active members of the community who bring experience in Law, Technology, Finance, Architecture and Real Estate. The parents of BSTA students chaperone at dances, provide parties and fundraisers, communicating calendar items, volunteer, and other tasks that teachers and staff aren’t able to accomplish. Parents and community members are encouraged to attend the school community council meetings to support and contribute to the better functioning of the School Land Trust Program. Learning environment Because of Beehive’s low student–teacher ratio (1:12), students can progress quickly . Students are placed in classes based on their math skills. Their skills in math and other core subjects are monitored throughout the year with research- based adaptive testing. Free tutoring is offered by every teacher every week after school. Field trips provide additional learning and socializing skills. Each year local, expedition, and out-of-state college trips are offered to students. Every spring, students have the opportunity to go to Europe with faculty and parents. Since its inception in 2005, Beehive teachers have been meeting with their students and parents at their homes. These visits benefit the parents since they gain a better idea about the school’s educational policy and have the opportunity to know and understand their student’s teacher(s) better. The goal is to visit all students in their homes once a year. Beehive Academy offers numerous after-school activities. For example, clubs meet weekly in the following areas: AMSP (Advanced Math & Science Program), FIRST Robotics club, FIRST LEGO club, chess, National Honor/Junior Honor Society, Structural Engineering, anatomy and dissection club, MathCounts, world cultures, glee club, jewelry club, yearbook, and more. These clubs have produced a number of successes in state and national competitions. A sampling of the winners are: 3rd place FTC Robotics team 2010-2011, 23rd place FIRST Lego League 2010-2011, 3rd place at the World Festival in FIRST Lego League, Utah FIRST Lego League State Champions (twice), 18 individual awards/scholarships 2009-2010 Regional Science Fair, 2008-2009 Salt Lake Valley Champion Spelling Bee, 3rd place in regional 2010-2011 Math Counts (top 10 in Utah).

Sanctuary is a 1961 drama film directed by Tony Richardson. The film, based on the William Faulkner novels Sanctuary (1931) and Requiem for a Nun (1961), is about the black maid of a white woman who kills the latter's newborn in order to give her employer a way out of a predicament, and then faces the death penalty.TCM Database entry Plot In 1928, in the county of Yoknapatawpha, Mississippi, Nancy Mannigoe, a 30-year-old black woman, is condemned to death for the willful murder of the infant son of her white employer Mrs. Gowan Stevens, the former Temple Drake. On the eve of the scheduled execution, Temple tries to save Nancy by telling her father, the governor, of the events leading up to the murder. Six years earlier, Temple was a pleasure-loving college girl carrying on a flirtatious romance with young Gowan Stevens. One night, Gowan got drunk and took her to a backwoods still where she was raped by Candy Man, a Cajun bootlegger. The next morning, although in a state of semi-shock, she willingly submitted to more of his lovemaking, and then agreed to live with him in a New Orleans brothel. Nancy became her personal maid, and Temple reveled in her new life, until Candy Man was reported killed in an auto accident and Temple was forced to go home. Marriage to Gowan followed; but for Temple it was a dull life, and she hired Nancy as a servant to remind her of the brothel life she had loved so much. Suddenly, Candy Man returned, and Temple decided to abandon her home and marriage and once more run off with him. To bring Temple to her senses and prevent her from ruining her life, Nancy sacrificed the infant child by smothering it to death. Though shocked by the candor of his daughter's confession, the governor is unable to grant a pardon for Nancy. The next morning Temple visits Nancy in her cell. As the two women beg each other's forgiveness, Temple realizes that it is only through Nancy's sacrifice that she has been able to find salvation. E. Pauline Degenfelder of Worcester Public Schools estimated that thirty percent of the plot takes place in the present time with the remainder in flashback; of that seventy percent flashback material, she attributed forty percent to the original novel, eight percent to the sequel novel, and the remainder to \\"a transition between Sanctuary and Requiem\\". The Lee Goodwin/Tommy element is not included.Phillips, \\"Faulkner And The Film: The Two Versions Of \\"Sanctuary\\",\\" p. 269. Note that the article says \\"Ira Stevens\\" is the new name even though credits state the name is \\"Ira Bobbitt\\". A car accident was used as a plot device for Temple to be discovered as, due to the absence of the aforementioned element,Phillips, Gene D. Fiction, Film, and Faulkner: The Art of Adaptation. University of Tennessee Press, 2001. , 9781572331662. p. 82. Horace Benbow is not in this version and therefore cannot track her down.Phillips, \\"Faulkner And The Film: The Two Versions Of \\"Sanctuary\\",\\" p. 269-270. Production Richard D. Zanuck produced the film.Degenfelder, 553. He made it an adaptation of both Faulkner novels because there were more commercial opportunities and because he believed the sequel novel alone could not be properly adapted into a film.Degenfelder, 553-554. Zanuck acquired the filming rights to both novels, and as part of this he spent $75,000 on the rights to The Story of Temple Drake as he was required to do so to get the said rights to the original novel.Degenfelder, 554. James Poe wrote the script, using an outline and prologue made by Zanuck because the latter was unable to contact Faulkner through employees sent to visit the author. Richardson stated that he wished to work on the film partly due to the depiction of the 1920s and 1930s United States in the original script, but he disliked the editing process for American films at the time and therefore he disliked the completed film.Phillips, \\"Faulkner And The Film: The Two Versions Of \\"Sanctuary\\",\\" p. 271. Cast * Lee Remick as Temple Drake ** Even though Temple is formally known as \\"Mrs. Gowan Stevens\\", she still calls herself by her maiden name. Gene D. Phillips of Loyola University of Chicago stated that internally she still perceives herself to be \\"an irresponsible adolescent\\" and undeserving of a reputation of being a responsible wife. Degenfelder argued that this film does not have a consistent Temple as it tried but failed to reconcile the two different Temples from the novels, and that the resulting character was \\"weak\\". In addition, while that film was, according to the reviewer, trying to have a dual nature like with the first film, she felt that Temple is \\"unconvincing\\" in the \\"vamp\\" role.Degenfelder, p. 555. * Odetta as Nancy Mannigoe ** Phillips described the character as \\"the focal point of the entire action of the combined stories.\\" In the portions adapted from the first novel, Nancy takes the role originally used by the character Ruby Lamar. This film works in a foreshadowing where Nancy says that Candy Man's still building is not suitable for a child to live in, which plays into the later scene where Nancy kills Temple's child to prevent the baby from being corrupted.Phillips, Gene D. Fiction, Film, and Faulkner: The Art of Adaptation. University of Tennessee Press, 2001. , 9781572331662. p. 80. * Yves Montand as Candy Man ** He is an amalgamation of characters from both source novels: Popeye, Red, and Pete (Red's brother). Phillips wrote that Candy's \\"French accent gives him an exotic quality\\" attracting Temple to him; the film has the character originate in New Orleans to match the change. Phillips stated that the merging of Pete into Candy Man means the film is made \\"more tightly into a continuous narrative\\" from the plots of the two original works, and also that the film does not have to make efforts to establish a new character towards the film's end.Phillips, Gene D. Fiction, Film, and Faulkner: The Art of Adaptation. University of Tennessee Press, 2001. , 9781572331662. p. 82-83. According to Degenfelder, the new character name is a reference to his sexual allure and his job illegally transporting alcohol, as \\"candy\\" also referred to alcohol. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times stated that Candy Man sounds like Charles Boyer. * Bradford Dillman as Gowan Stevens * Harry Townes as Ira Bobbitt ** The novel version is Gavin Stevens. Gene Phillips of Loyola University of Chicago wrote that the name was likely altered to avoid confusion with Gowan. * Howard St. John as Governor Drake ** He is an amalgamation of the governor and Judge Drake (Temple's father) from the original works. Phillips wrote that making the governor her father is \\"possibly to explain quickly and plausibly her easy access to a man in this position\\". * Jean Carson as Norma * Reta Shaw as Miss Reba * Strother Martin as Dog Boy * William Mims as Lee * Marge Redmond as Flossie * Jean Bartel as Swede Horace Benbow, Lee Goodwin, and Tommy do not appear in this version. Degenfelder wrote that the merging of characters results in \\"ludicrous coincidence\\" being a feature of the plot. Reception Phillips characterized the reaction from the general audiences and from film critics as \\"lukewarm\\". Crowther wrote that the film \\"no more reflects or comprehends the evil in the Faulkner stories or the social corruption suggested in them than did\\" the previous adaptation, and that Sanctuary was a \\"melodrama of the most mechanical and meretricious sort\\" that lacked the explanation for Temple's behavior. Crowther praised Remick's acting. Degenfelder argued that the source material was poorly combined and adapted, with the work \\"woefully deficient in movement\\", resulting in \\"an artistic disaster.\\" In addition she felt this version was misogynistic.

It is based on the 1742 novel Joseph Andrews by Henry Fielding. With its rollicking comic plot, period costume and setting, ribald adventures and a dashing young hero, the film was an obvious attempt to follow in the line of such films as Tom Jones, which was also directed by Tony Richardson. Ann-Margret was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 1978 for her performance in the film. Vincent Canby of the New York Times explains the pretext of Henry Fielding's novel Joseph Andrews: The book \\"originated as Fielding's answer to what he saw as the hypocritical pieties of [British novelist] Samuel Richardson's Pamela. In Pamela, which was published in 1740, Richardson told the inspiring tale of Pamela Andrews, a serving girl who tenaciously held onto her virginity until her employer, the rich Mr. Booby, came across with a marriage license. Several years later, Mr. Fielding turned this story wildly upside down in a novel about Pamela's brother, Joseph, a serving boy who is as innocent as his sister but not nearly as calculating, who must fight off all sorts of lewd advances and whose triumph is one of true virtue rather than greed.\\" Plot Lady Booby alias \\"Belle\\", the lively wife of the fat landed squire Sir Thomas Booby, has a lusty eye on the attractive, intelligent villager Joseph Andrews, a Latin pupil and protégé of parson Adams, and makes him their footman. Joseph's heart belongs to a country girl, foundling Fanny Goodwill, but his masters take him on a trip to fashionable Bath, where spoiled society comes mainly to see and be seen. Sir Thomas really seeks relief for his sick foot, but drowns in the famous Roman baths. The all-but- grieving lady attempts to seduce Joseph, but, on finding that his Christian virtue and true love are as immune to her passes as to those of the many ladies who fancy her footman, she fires him. On his way back home on foot, Joseph falls prey to highwaymen who rob him of everything, even the clothes on his back. He is found and nursed by an innkeeper's maid; lusts are stirred at the inn, once more challenging his honour, until he is found by the good parson. Meanwhile, the lady consents to her cousin marrying below his station, on learning that his fiancée is Joseph's sister, Pamela. The parson prevents an attempted rape by a squire, and barely escapes a wicked gentleman's totally unjust justice after being accused of it - he comes to learn of a significant child theft by gypsies. Meanwhile, the parson, Joseph and Fanny again fall prey to the squire's utter debauchery...IMDB Joseph Andrews Plot Summary, KGF Vissers https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076234/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl Cast * Ann-Margret as Lady Booby * Peter Firth as Joseph Andrews * Michael Hordern as Parson Adams * Jim Dale as the Pedlar * Beryl Reid as Mrs. Slipslop * Natalie Ogle as Fanny Goodwill * John Gielgud as the Doctor * Hugh Griffith as Squire Western * Peter Bull as Sir Thomas Booby * Karen Dotrice as Pamela * Peggy Ashcroft as Lady Tattle * James Villiers as Mr. Booby * Timothy West as Mr. Tow-Wouse * Wendy Craig as Mrs. Tow-Wouse * Ronald Pickup as Mr. Wilson * Penelope Wilton as Mrs. Wilson * Kenneth Cranham as The Wicked Squire * Norman Rossington as Gaffer Andrews * Patsy Rowlands as Gammer Andrews Production Paramount announced the film in May 1976.MOVIE CALL SHEET: Elliott More Than a Sex Symbol Murphy, Mary.

The ballads were sung by Jim Dale who plays the gypsy in the movie. Reception Vincent Canby of The New York Times was impressed with the film: \\"Joseph Andrews contains more great (and more greatly funny) character performances than any film I've seen in years. It's one of the few movies around now that truly lifts the spirits, not only because it is so good- humored but also because the humor is laced with so much wit and wisdom. ...(Ann-Margret) looks great and she is enchantingly funny, but so is almost everyone else in a cast so big I really don't know where to begin, since I'm sure to leave out someone important. It's one of those films in which even the smaller roles are as beautifully and as memorably done as the larger ones. ...The film is ... an almost perfect blending of beauty, romance and adventure, of landscapes too lovely to believe alternating with the kind of gritty period detail that prompts one character (Squire Thomas) to say of a street jam in the resort city of Batti, 'The only things that move here are the bowels of the horses.'\\" John Addison's score was well received. The period costumes by Michael Annals are extraordinarily flamboyant. David Watkin's cinematography was praised as clever and particularly reflective of the period depicted, demonstrating a \\"painterly quality\\" and an artistic use of lighting.

For his novels about English history and culture and his biographies of, among others, William Blake, Charles Dickens, T. S. Eliot, Charles Chaplin and Sir Thomas More, he won the Somerset Maugham Award and two Whitbread Awards. He is noted for the volume of work he has produced, the range of styles therein, his skill at assuming different voices, and the depth of his research. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1984 and appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2003. Early life and education Ackroyd was born in London and raised on a council estate in East Acton, in what he has described as a \\"strict\\" Roman Catholic household by his mother and grandmother, after his father disappeared from the family home. He first knew that he was gay when he was seven. He was educated at St. Benedict's, Ealing, and at Clare College, Cambridge, from which he graduated with a double first in English literature. In 1972, he was a Mellon fellow at Yale University. Work The result of his Yale fellowship was Notes for a New Culture, written when Ackroyd was only 22 and eventually published in 1976. The title, an echo of T. S. Eliot's Notes Towards the Definition of Culture (1948), was an early indication of Ackroyd's penchant for exploring and re-examining the works of other London-based writers. He worked at The Spectator magazine between 1973 and 1977 as literary editor and became joint managing editor in 1978, a position he held until 1982. He worked as chief book reviewer for The Times and was a frequent broadcaster on radio. Since 1984 he has been a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. His literary career began with poetry; his work in that field includes such works as London Lickpenny (1973) and The Diversions of Purley (1987). In 1982 he published The Great Fire of London, his first novel, which is a reworking of Charles Dickens' novel Little Dorrit. The novel set the stage for the long sequence of novels Ackroyd has produced since, all of which deal in some way with the complex interaction of time and space and what Ackroyd calls \\"the spirit of place\\". However, this transition to being a novelist was unexpected. In an interview with Patrick McGrath in 1989, Ackroyd said: > I enjoy it, I suppose, but I never thought I'd be a novelist. I never wanted > to be a novelist. I can't bear fiction. I hate it. It's so untidy. When I > was a young man I wanted to be a poet, then I wrote a critical book, and I > don't think I even read a novel till I was about 26 or 27.McGrath, Patrick. > \\"Peter Ackroyd Interview\\" BOMB Magazine Winter, 1989. Retrieved 19 January > 2011. In his novels he often contrasts historical settings with present-day segments (e.g. The Great Fire of London, Hawksmoor, The House of Doctor Dee). Many of Ackroyd's novels are set in London and deal with the ever-changing, but at the same time stubbornly consistent nature of the city. Often this theme is explored through the city's artists, especially its writers: Oscar Wilde in The Last Testament of Oscar Wilde (1983), a fake autobiography of Wilde; Nicholas Hawksmoor, Sir Christopher Wren and Sir John Vanbrugh in Hawksmoor (1985); Thomas Chatterton and George Meredith in Chatterton (1987); John Dee in The House of Dr Dee (1993); Dan Leno, Karl Marx, George Gissing and Thomas De Quincey in Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem (1994); John Milton in Milton in America (1996); Charles Lamb in The Lambs of London. Hawksmoor, winner of both the Whitbread Novel Award and the Guardian Fiction Prize, was inspired by Iain Sinclair's poem \\"Lud Heat\\" (1975), which speculated on a mystical power from the positioning of the six churches Nicholas Hawksmoor built. The novel gives Hawksmoor a Satanical motive for the siting of his buildings, and creates a modern namesake, a policeman investigating a series of murders. Chatterton (1987), a similarly layered novel explores plagiarism and forgery and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. London: The Biography is an extensive and thorough discussion of London through the ages. In 1994 he was interviewed about the London Psychogeographical Association in an article for The Observer, in which he remarked: > I truly believe that there are certain people to whom or through whom the > territory, the place, the past speaks. ... Just as it seems possible to me > that a street or dwelling can materially affect the character and behaviour > of the people who dwell in them, is it not also possible that within this > city (London) and within its culture are patterns of sensibility or patterns > of response which have persisted from the thirteenth and fourteenth > centuries and perhaps even beyond?'Cultists' Go Round in Circles', Barry > Hugill, The Observer, Sunday 28 August 1994. In the sequence London: The Biography (2000), Albion: The Origins of the English Imagination (2002), and Thames: Sacred River (2007), Ackroyd has produced works of what he considers historical sociology. These books trace themes in London and English culture from the ancient past to the present, drawing again on his favoured notion of almost spiritual lines of connection rooted in place and stretching across time. His fascination with London literary and artistic figures is also displayed in the sequence of biographies he has produced of Ezra Pound (1980), T. S. Eliot (1984), Charles Dickens (1990), William Blake (1995), Thomas More (1998), Geoffrey Chaucer (2004), William Shakespeare (2005), and J. M. W. Turner. The city itself stands astride all these works, as it does in the fiction. Ackroyd was forced to think of new methods of biography writing in T. S. Eliot when he was told he couldn't quote extensively from Eliot's poetry and unpublished letters. From 2003 to 2005, Ackroyd wrote a six-book non-fiction series (Voyages Through Time), intended for readers as young as eight, his first work for children. The critically acclaimed series—described as \\"Not just sound-bite snacks for short attention spans, but unfolding feasts that leave you with a sense of wonder\\" by The Sunday Times is an extensive narrative of key periods in world history. In a 2012 interview with Matthew Stadlen of the BBC, when asked the question, \\"Who do you think is the person who has made the biggest impact upon the life of this country ever?\\", Ackroyd said, \\"I think William Blake is the most powerful and most significant philosopher or thinker in the course of English history.\\" In the same interview, when asked what fascinates him about London, he said he admired \\"its power, its majesty, its darkness, its shadows.\\" When asked what he did outside of writing, he said, \\"I drink, that's about it.\\" Personal life Ackroyd had a long-term relationship with Brian Kuhn, an American dancer he met while at Yale. After a nervous breakdown in the late 1980s, Ackroyd moved to Devon with Kuhn. However, Kuhn was then diagnosed with AIDS, and died in 1994, after which Ackroyd moved back to London. In 1999, he suffered a heart attack and was placed in a medically induced coma for a week. In a 2004 interview, Ackroyd said that he had not been in a relationship since Kuhn's death and was \\"very happy being celibate.\\" List of works  Poetry  *1971 Ouch! *1973 London Lickpenny *1978 Country Life *1987 The Diversions of Purley and Other Poems  Fiction  *1982 The Great Fire of London *1983 The Last Testament of Oscar Wilde *1985 Hawksmoor *1987 Chatterton *1989 First Light *1992 English Music *1993 The House of Doctor Dee *1994 Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem (also published as The Trial of Elizabeth Cree) *1996 Milton in America *1999 The Plato Papers *2000 The Mystery of Charles Dickens *2003 The Clerkenwell Tales *2004 The Lambs of London *2006 The Fall of Troy *2008 The Casebook of Victor Frankenstein *2009 The Canterbury Tales – A Retelling *2010 The Death of King Arthur: The Immortal Legend – A Retelling *2013 Three Brothers *2020 Mr Cadmus Non-fiction *1976 Notes for a New Culture: An Essay on Modernism *1979 Dressing Up: Transvestism and Drag, the History of an Obsession *1980 Ezra Pound and His World *1984 T.

She launched her career in 1993 as a part of the duo Funky G, together with her former husband Gagi Djogani. The duo split in 2009 because Gagi Đogani was abusive in their marriage. Anabela continued her career as a solo singer, and released her first solo album, Igra sudbine, on 21 July 2010 through City Records. Life and career 1975–1990: Early childhood Anabela Bukva was born in Goražde, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFR Yugoslavia to a Bosniak Muslim father Ahmed Bukva and Bosnian Serb mother Jadranka Polutak. Her parents filed for divorce when she was three or four years old. The divorce was finalized when she began first grade of primary school. It was initially argued in court that Anabela would live with her father because her mother did not have the financial capabilities to care for Anabela. The court did not favor this opinion, but could not make a decision. Instead, the matter was given to Anabela to decide with whom she would live after the divorce. Because of a strong connection with her father, Anabela chose to remain with her father. Anabela describes herself and her father as being a \\"dream team\\"; they were inseparable. She was immersed in music from an early age. Her father would play the guitar for her, and the two would often sing duets together. She grew up with her father's two half-brothers from her paternal grandfather's second marriage. The older half-brother is four years older than Anabela, and the younger Anabela's age. Because they were all close in age, Anabela viewed them as her brothers. She was a self-described tomboy, and practiced karate. She finished her primary education in Goražde, and decided to relocate to Sarajevo at the age of 13 for secondary education in foreign languages. She lived in Sarajevo for two years, having moved between thirteen apartments during her short stay. She has two paternal half-sisters, Ilda and Aida (born 1985), who is an actress. 1990–2005: Bosnian War and Funky G During winter break in late 1990, Anabela left Bosnia for Switzerland with her boyfriend, Nikola. Shortly after they left, their home country Yugoslavia began breaking up and several wars started, including one in Bosnia. Nikola returned to Bosnia, as his parents had been left behind. He became one of the first victims of the war. Anabela remained in Switzerland for a short period, and could not return to Bosnia because of border closures. She had no family in Switzerland nor contact with family in Bosnia, so she decided to relocate to Belgrade. Looking for a normal life, she gained some footing in Belgrade through the help of Nikola's family. A refugee from Croatia hired Anabela to work as a secretary in his office. After seeing a commercial advertising for the opening of the Đogani Dance School, she decided to sign up for dance classes. Gazmen \\"Gagi\\" Đogani, a dance instructor at the Đogani Dance School, was attracted to Anabela and immediately offered to take her on a date. Anabela described the relationship as an instant love. The duo spent hours choreographing dances to Western songs by popular artists such as Bobby Brown, Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston. Gagi decided to create an all-girl music group in 1993. The duo split, both professionally and privately, in 2009. Anabela continued her career as a solo singer. Montenegrin singer Nenad Knežević Knez and Serbian rapper Milan 011 wrote a song for the group, called Samo u snu (Only in Dreams). Knez questioned Gagi's choice of having many different girls performing in the group, instead opting to have just Anabela perform. Gagi agreed on a whim and asked Anabela to join his group, Funky G. Although liking the idea, she was reluctant to do it. The duo eventually recorded a video for the song Samo u snu. Having received an invitation to come, Anabela decided to move to Sweden to live with her mother. She gained refugee status in Sweden, and began attending school. In the meantime, Gagi replaced Anabela with another woman. Within a few months, Gagi began repeatedly calling Anabela during her stay in Sweden, informing her of the success of their single throughout the clubs in Serbia. Gagi begged Anabela to return to Serbia immediately to perform at a concert in the famed Sava Center. Anabela did not immediately believe Gagi, and remained skeptical. Gagi sent Anabela a banknote of 5,000 Deutsche Marks as proof that he was earning money on behalf of her own work. Still unconvinced, Anabela, by chance, watched a report on CNN on the nightlife of Belgrade's youth during a time of economic sanctions. Many different nightclubs were showcased in the report, and in several of them, Anabela heard the song she and Gagi had earlier made. Finally believing Gagi, she reluctantly agreed to come back despite having been awarded refugee status. Anabela was shocked by the celebrity status she had gained in Belgrade. The public started to associate Funky G with Anabela. In an effort to appease fans, Anabela decided to attend vocal schooling to improve her singing ability and provide vocals in subsequent Funky G releases. After the release of Funky G's second album in 1995, Anabela unexpectedly became pregnant. Gagi, after hearing the news, was indifferent about the pregnancy. However, after hearing the baby's heartbeat on the ultrasound, Gagi became excited about his first child. In preparation for the baby's delivery, Gagi and Anabela saved money to purchase an apartment of their own. Anabela gave birth to her daughter Luna in 1996. She later miscarried twins, and had trouble getting pregnant thereafter. She sought the help of fertility doctors, aiding her in becoming pregnant with her second daughter, Nina. 2009–present: Breakup and solo career Marital problems between Anabela and Gagi became evident following Nina's birth in 2005. After a long period of instability in the relationship, the marriage ended in April 2009 and Anabela subsequently left Funky G to start a solo career. Anabela is currently married to a Bosnian Jewish businessman Andrej Atijas. Atijas lived in Serbia where he studied, and his mother lives in Pančevo. They have one daughter together, Blankica Atijas born 20 May 2013 in Sarajevo. After living in Sarajevo for a year, Anabela returned to live in Belgrade.http://www.ekskluziva.ba/Anabela- Vracam-se-u-Srbiju-a-muz-mi-ostaje-u-Sarajevu-/48417.html Anabela released her first solo album, Igra sudbine, on 21 July 2010 through City Records.

It was designed by James Chadley and Edward Hallen (attributed), Francis Clarke and Robertson & Marks (service wing) and built from 1834 to 1836. The property is owned by the National Trust of Australia (NSW). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. Lindesay was the first major house to be constructed on Darling Point and is aesthetically important as the earliest example of the domestic Gothic Revival style in Sydney. Some of its residents were colourful figures who played an important part in the history of New South Wales.  History  Darling Point or Yarranabbee Originally known by its Aboriginal name Yarranabbee, Darling Point was called Mrs Darling's Point by Governor Ralph Darling (1825-31 Governor) in honour of his wife, Eliza. At that time the area was heavily timbered, but after New South Head Road was built in 1831 timber cutters felled most of the trees, and the land was subdivided. Most of the plots, covering 9-15 acres in this area, were taken up between 1833 and 1838. The suburb later became known as Darling Point. Several notable people bought land and built homes here, including surveyor-general Sir Thomas Mitchell's Carthona and one-time home Lindesay. Mrs Darling's Point was named by Surveyor Larmer, who did the original survey (on 11 September 1833 nine allotments were laid out).Crosson, 2012 The first land grant was made in 1833 to a Thomas Holt. In 1833 \\"villa allotments\\" were advertised for sale at \\"Mrs Darling's Point\\". There were soon several cottages and villas built in the area, but from the 1840s more grandiose mansions arose as the colony's most successful businessmen bought up land on the point. ....Daily Telegraph, 2007, 30 Lindesay Lindesay is an 1834-6 house built for the then colony's Treasurer, Mr Campbell Drummond Riddell (b.1796 - a young and well-connected Scotsman) and his wife Caroline (née Stuart Rodney, b.1814 in Ceylon, the 16-year-old daughter of the Government Secretary in Colombo) on a site of of land with stables, outbuildings and garden sweeping down to the harbour. The property took two years to complete. It was designed as a villa – typically a free-standing rectangular block which presents a different, self- contained facade on each side. This was a style much favoured by professional families at the time in rural Britain but, although bearing similarities to designs in English Regency Pattern Books, the design of Lindesay is simpler, reflecting a mix of Scottish austerity with a good dose of colonial disregard for convention. This very simplicity could possibly be read as a snub to Governor Bourke, who was rapidly becoming persona non grata for Riddell and others in colonial society and whose plans for a new Government House were \\"modern Gothic\\" and ornate, to say the least. The design owed much to contemporary pattern books and was also attributed initially to James Chadley and Edward Hallen, although the work was completed under the direction of Francis Clarke. It was named in honour of Colonel Patrick Lindesay (1778-1839) who was acting governor of the colony from 22 October to 2 December 1831, between the departure of Governor Darling and the arrival of the next governor, Sir Richard Bourke. This Acting Governor reserved the for Riddell in 1834 and it is believed that this favour of reserving the land led Riddell to name the house after his friend, the fellow Scot, Patrick Lindesay. The Riddells moved into Lindesay with their two-year-old son in 1836, but remained there only two years. Following their departure the property had a number of owners including Sir Thomas Mitchell who, as Surveyor-General in the 1830s, conducted three major expeditions into the interior of Australia. In 1841 he sold it to his friend Sir Charles Nicholson, an avid collector of rare books and antiquities and future chancellor of the University of Sydney. Nicholson housed his library, thought to be one of the largest private libraries in the colony, at Lindesay, with a special room set aside for his statues. In 1849 Nicholson sold to William Bradley, a wealthy pastoralist who had married Emily Hovell, daughter of explorer William Hovell. He died at Lindesay in 1868. Additions to the house, new and altered outbuildings and changes to the property boundaries were made by successive owners throughout the 19th century, including James Barker (1838–41); Mitchell (1841–45); Nicholson (1845–59); William Bradley (1849-68); and John Macintosh (1868-1911). Sir Thomas Mitchell, Surveyor-General of NSW, bought Lindesay in 1841 to be in a better position to supervise the construction of his own house, Carthona, down on the Darling Point waterfront nearby (to its south).Russell, 1980, 67 Mitchell in the 1830s had undertaken three major expeditions throughout Australia, taking his reports back to England and being knighted for his effort. His youngest daughter Blanche was born here in 1843. He sold the house in 1843 to his friend, Dr Charles Nicholson, eminent art collector and patron of artists. Sir Thomas Mitchell in 1841 began to build Carthona near the water's edge. He wanted to escape Darlinghurst (his home here on Darlinghurst Ridge was called 'Craigend') which he now considered \\"too built up\\". Carthona was another Gothic revival manor, complete with castellations. The design was copied from an English pattern book. Sir Charles Nicholson purchased Lindesay in 1845, after moving to Sydney in 1843 and being elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council. He would later become Speaker. He sold Lindesay to William Bradley in 1849. Sydney newspapers of the mid 1850s give reports of the social activities of the era and of the hostesses who entertained with charm and elan. One of the famous venues was the Gothic style mansion Lindesay. It was ... occupied ...later by William Bradley, a wealthy pastoralist, who reared his motherless daughters in the house. City of Sydney councillor John Macintosh bought the property in 1868. While he was at Lindesay, Macintosh built two other houses on Darling Point - Braeside and Cintra - for his children. In 1911 Macintosh died at Lindesay and it was sold two years later to Alfred Wunderlich who subdivided it. After subdivision, which involved removal of its 19th century garden, the house and a small area of land around it were bought by Dr Edward Jenkins. He engaged Robertson & Marks as architects for the rebuilding of the service wing at the rear of the house and internal alterations including bathrooms and replacement of the principal stair in the main house. The property was sold to the Pye family in 1926, the Macintoshes moving to a smaller house at 35 New South Head Road, Vaucluse. Charles and Mary Pye lived the rest of their life at Lindesay. (pre WW2) Walter Pye built a gazebo between the (now) parterre garden and the main garden. In 1960, Colonel Pye divided the house into three flats, with further subsequent internal alterations. On his death in 1963, his brother Walter D. Pye donated the house and a collection of furniture to the National Trust of Australia (NSW). In 1960 Cherry Jackaman joined Dame Helen Blaxland on the Women's Committee of the National Trust of Australia (NSW). Jackaman chaired this committee from 1964 to 1967, and by 1968 it had raised more than $100,000, which was directed to Experiment Farm Cottage, Lindesay and the St.Matthews Anglican Church at Windsor Appeal.McGuiness, 23-24/9/11 The committee was established to raise funds, source furnishings and encourage membership of the trust. Since 1963 the house has been used by committees of the National Trust of Australia (NSW) as offices and has also been used for public functions and exhibitions. In 1964 the Lindesay Management Committee was established by the National Trust (NSW). Fundraising commenced through exhibitions, antique fairs, etc. Dame Helen Blaxland chaired this committee from its inauguration until 1976, then continuing her involvement as \\"Honourable Housekeeper\\". The Women's Committee of the National Trust (NSW) continue to run events including an annual antiques/decorating fair and private home visits to fund raise for the maintenance of Lindesay. Guy Lovell was honorary architect for the National Trust, charged with restoring the property. In 1966 the Lindesay Garden Group was established to recreate a garden setting reminiscent of early designs. Diana Pockley was appointed chair. The garden plan focussed on the harbour view. This was framed by trees and plantings tall enough to obscure adjacent buildings, and remains today, adding a wonderful dimension to the rich colour and form of the grounds - a direct link between the property today, and as it was in the days of its first occupants. In the 1960s garden designer Jocelyn Brown designed a plan for the entrance garden at Lindesay. An existing plane tree (Platanus orientalis) in the centre of the space dictated the shape of the plan. Sawn stone edging was suggested for the garden beds, in keeping with the stone of the kitchen courtyard of the house, and the drive was finished with brick gutters. This entrance, with minor changes in planting detail, has developed into an impressive shaded forecourt to the building, a leafy canopy enriched with darker greens around the periphery. To the east of the house where the grounds are walled, a formal courtyard (parterre) garden was planted, laid out to designs by Guy Lovell. This remains today (2003), a geometric arrangement of gravel paths and low box (Buxus sempervirens) hedges define flower beds planted with ivy (Hedera sp.). This parterre is enclosed with a high, clipped privet hedge (Ligustrum sp.), and presided over by \\"the Four Seasons\\", a fine set of 19th century, Italian female figure sculptures of Serena stone. The funds to enable this work were raised by the Lindesay Garden Group and Lindesay Management Committee, by women including Diana Pockley, Dame Helen Blaxland, Peggy Muntz and Rosemary Fairbairn. In 1967 the National Trust reconstituted the Lindesay Garden Group as the National Trust Garden Committee, with Diana Pockley as chair. This committee's work was broader, including work on replanting the grounds of Experiment Farm cottage, Parramatta, Old Government House, Parramatta and Riversdale, Goulburn. The Women's Committee's plan was to recreate a garden setting for the villa that was reminiscent of 19th century gardens. An English oak (Quercus robur) was planted as a symbol of \\"home\\" for the first lady of the house, Caroline Riddell. A hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii) was added to acknowledge the place of native \\"auricarias\\" in 19th century horticultural fashion, and the central lawn sweeping down to the (harbour) view was edged with other plants on the era's must-have lists. Long-time volunteer Ros Sweetapple jokes about being closely supervised in the early days, and only allowed to trim the (box) parterre with nail scissors. She also recalls visits made to Rookwood Cemetery to collect cuttings of old roses to fill Lindesay's beds with authentic, 19th century plant material.Powell, 2016 In 1989-91 the National Trust went through turbulent times. A new management committee was established for Lindesay, chaired by Aline Fenwick OBE, which organised many fund raising events, exhibitions, open days and opportunities to hire out the property to generate income to maintain it.Simpson, C., 2003 In August 2009 the Governor Marie Bashir, Sir Nicholas Shehadie and other guests enjoyed a dinner party hosted by the Trust Board to mark Lindesay's 175th anniversary. With a Scottish theme to honour its first owner, Campbell Drummond Riddell, and many subsequent Scottish owners, guests included Mr Edward Sly, descendant of Sir Thomas Mitchell, second owner of Lindesay and generous donor of Mitchell memorabilia to the house; Mr Jim Macintosh, a descendant of the family which owned Lindesay from 1870 to 1913 and generous donor to the house. Guests enjoyed the new garden planting and inspired garden lighting, all possible by the fundraising work of the Special Events Panel of the Women's Committee (National Trust Magazine (NSW), Aug.-Oct.2009/Spring, 5). National Trust Magazine NSW November 2008-January 2009: $5,969 was used to assist in maintenance of the garden. May 2013 - The National Trust Women's Committee celebrated 50 years of National Trust ownership of the property. This committee has used Lindesay extensively over the years as a base for events for fundraising for the trust.National Trust News, 5/2013 By 2014 the attempt to make a 19th-century garden in the 21st century was failing and the focus on authentic plant material gave way to something more elusive. The aim was to recreate the sense of pleasure that being in the garden at Lindesay always provided: to offset the house and views without replicating a vintage plant palette. Partly this change had to do with pragmatism. Like all Trust properties, Lindesay has to sing for its supper. The weddings functions, fairs, photo and film shoots that pay its way all demand a garden that looks good every day of the year. To make it happen, the mature plantings stayed but everything else went. Private garden designer Christopher Nicholas devised a modern planting plna that has references to the past and looks good in a wedding photo. Flowers flush throughout the year, mostly in subtle blue tones, and a tapestry of silver, blue and purple foliage supplements the background greens. A team of volunteers keep it in great condition, with five-hours-a- week help from a professional, Nicholas Ball of Avant Design. The National Trust Women's Committee will launch its oral history collection on 20 May 2017. This extraordinary group of women have achieved much. Formed in 1961, they have raised over $20m for the National Trust of Australia (NSW) in 56 years. To record their own story the Women's Committee initiated its oral history collection and in conjunction with \\"Having a Voice\\", have curated a modest exhibition capturing the mood of the times.NTA, 2017 The Riddells who built Lindesay Campbell Drummond Riddell and his wife Caroline Stuart Riddell Campbell Drummond Riddell was born in 1796 in Scotland. His grandfather was Sir James Riddell, first baronet of Ardnamurchan, Argyllshire. In 1829 he joined the colonial service and was sent briefly to Ceylon as a commissioner of inquiry. While he was in Ceylon he met Caroline Stuart Rodney who was the daughter of the government secretary there.Metcalfe, J. 1967, \\"Riddell, Campbell Drummond (1796-1858)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol. 2., Melbourne University Press, pp. 377-9. Caroline was born in 1814 in Ceylon and was only 16 when she married Campbell Riddell in 1830 in Colombo. She was part of a very large family. Her father was the Honorable John Rodney and her mother was Lady Louisa Martha Stratford, his second wife. Her mother died when she was a baby and her father married again.Lodge, E. 1860, \\"The Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire, p. 486. Shortly after the Riddells were married they sailed to Sydney where Campbell was to assume his new appointment as Colonial Treasurer of New South Wales. In 1834 Campbell commenced construction of Lindesay on Darling Point. They moved into the house in 1836 and by this time they had one two-year-old son. They resided at Lindesay for only a short time, less than two years. A notice in the Sydney Gazette for April 1838 said that Caroline had given birth to their second child, a son, at Darlinghurst.The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser, 3 April 1838, p. 3. Campbell and Caroline had five children altogether, two sons and three daughters. Lindesay, Darling Point, when it was still very isolated The Riddells remained in Sydney until 1857 and then returned to England. They took up residence in Regent's Park Terrace which was and still is a very fashionable part of London. The following year in 1858 Campbell died at his home.\\"Gentleman's Magazine\\", Vol 206., February, 1859, p. 219. The Census data for the United Kingdom and other directories show that Caroline remained at Regents Park Terrace for the next 10 years and then moved to 16 Wellington Square in Cheltenham.UK Census Data for the years 1861, 1871, 1881 and 1891 and \\"Boyle's Fashionable Court And Country Guide\\", 1860, p. 202 and 1869 One of her daughters, Louisa, who did not marry lived with her. Caroline died in 1898 at the age of 84 at her home.England and Wales BDM, Death Index The portrait of Campbell is recorded as having been donated to the Mitchell Library in 1938 by E. Knowles. The second eldest daughter, also named Caroline, married Louis William Knowles so this appears to be a relative. This portrait also has some historical interest. In 1829 before the couple came to Australia it was in an Exhibition of the Royal Academy. Listed as a Portrait of Campbell Riddell Esq by J. Partridge it was favourably mentioned and was one of those described as a \\"very clever portrait\\".\\"The Literary Gazette and Journal of Belles Lettres, Arts, Sciences\\" London, 1829, p. 394. After the Riddells left Lindesay in 1838 there were two owners over a very short period. Thomas Icely held the house for about a year and then sold it to James Barker who, with his brother, subdivided the property into eighteen allotments and put them and the house up for sale in 1841. Thomas Mitchell bought the house and some of the land on the same day that it was advertised. The Mitchell family in residence Sir Thomas Mitchell Thomas Mitchell was born in 1792 in Scotland. His family was not wealthy but he joined the military and was proficient in drawing up plans of battlefields. In 1818 he married Mary Thomson Blunt who was the eighteen-year-old daughter of General Richard Blunt.Baxter, D. W. A. 1967 \\"Mitchell, Sir Thomas Livingstone (1792-1855), Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol 2, Melbourne University Press, p. 238-42. In 1827 the couple came to Sydney and Thomas became Assistant Surveyor General of New South Wales and two years later became Surveyor General. During the 1830s Mitchell conducted three major expeditions into the interior of Australia. In 1837 he went to England and published a book about his explorations and obtained his knighthood. He returned to Sydney from England in 1841 and soon after purchased Lindesay. When the Mitchells came to Lindesay they had been married for 23 years and Mary had borne eleven children, of whom one died in infancy. At this time there were six sons and four daughters all under 22 years of age. While they were living at Lindesay another daughter, Blanche, was born in 1843.Foster, W. C. 1985, \\"Sir Thomas Livingston Mitchell and His world 1792-1855\\", The Institution of Surveyors NSW Inc, Sydney. While he was at Lindesay Mitchell was planning to build Carthona also on Darling Point. Besides buying Lindesay on Lot 1 in 1841, Mitchell also bought Lots 7,12,13,14 and 15. It is on the last four lots that Carthona was constructed. In 1845 the Mitchell family moved into Carthona and Mitchell sold Lindesay to his friend Sir Charles Nicholson. Sir Charles Nicholson as the owner of Lindesay Sir Charles Nicholson 1867 Sir Charles Nicholson was born in 1808\`in England. His parents died while he was young and he was brought up by a maiden aunt in Yorkshire. He obtained a good education and graduated as a medical doctor in 1833. In the same year he came to Sydney with his aunt and joined his uncle Captain James Ascough who was a very wealthy man. A few years later his uncle died and Charles inherited his extensive wealth. He moved to Sydney and in 1843 was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council and three years later became Speaker of the council.Macmillan, D. S. 1967, \\"Nicholson, Sir Charles (1808-1903)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, vol. 2, Melbourne University Press, pp. 283-5. By the time he purchased Lindesay in 1845 he had begun to collect rare books, antiquities, pictures and manuscripts. At this stage he was a bachelor and with his considerable wealth he had the time and money to indulge his interest. One visitor to the house said that Nicholson had a very fine library which he thought was one of the largest private libraries in the colony and he also had a special room for his statues. In 1849 Charles bought Tarmons, a large house at Potts Point and sold Lindesay to William Bradley. After he left Lindesay he played an important part in the establishment of Sydney University and later became its chancellor. In 1862 he returned to England and married Sarah Keightley. He died in 1903 at the age of 95. William Bradley and his children William Bradley circa 1860 William Bradley was born in New South Wales and was a very wealthy pastoralist. He had extensive grazing lands in the Monaro district and owned the property called Landsdowne near Goulburn. In 1831 he married Emily Hovell daughter of William Hovel, the explorer, and they had eight children, three of whom died at a fairly early age.Walsh, G. P. 1969 \\"Bradley William (1800-1868)\\" Australian Dictionary of Biography, vol 3, Melbourne University Press, pp 215-6. In 1843 he became the member for Argyle in the New South Wales Legislative Council. In 1846 he took his family to Europe because of his wife's poor health but unfortunately she died while they were in Rome in 1848. He now had to care for his five daughters alone. He returned to Australia and in 1849 bought Lindesay where he brought up his children. His daughters grew up and eventually married. Sadly his second daughter Esther died at Lindesay in 1856 at age 22. Her death notice records that she had been married to an Englishman, Edward Maitland, and had an infant son.The Sydney Morning Herald, 9 May 1856, p. 1. In 1858 the family went to England for two years. A diary by Georgina Mann indicates that William Baker Boulton may have leased the property during this time as she speaks of the Boultons at a ball there. However it is possible that Mrs Boulton was the housekeeper for Lindesay as there are numerous advertisements in the Sydney Morning Herald for staff for Lindesay in which Mrs Boulton is listed as the person to contact. These occur during and even well before the time the Bradleys left for England.Sydney Morning Herald, 24 September 1858, p. 1.; 23 August 1855, p. 1.; 12 July 1856, p. 1. In 1859 there is a birth notice for a son born at Lindesay in the newspaper to Mrs A Rhodes.The Sydney Morning Herald, 13 September 1859, p. 9. It is at least possible that the Rhodes were the leasees and the Boultons were staff who perhaps lived at Lindesay. Mrs A Rhodes (Mary Waud Rhodes (née Wilson))was the wife of Alexander Rhodes (Civil Engineer). They had married 19 June 1855 at the British Embassy, Paris, Île- de-France, France. Alexander Rhodes had come to New South Wales to work on the construction of the Campbelltown-Picton section of the main Southern line railway line after being appointed engineer by the firm Messrs. Peto, Brassey and Co. (formerly Messrs. Peto, Brassey and Betts, for whom his cousin Thomas Rhodes Firth had also come to New South Wales to expand the railway network. Thomas R Firth became Civil Engineer-in-Chief for the NSW Rail) (information within family history of A. Firth with original sourcing from certificates and known facts from the family). In 1868 William Bradley died at Lindesay and the house was bought by John Macintosh who lived there for 43 years and was its longest resident. The Macintosh family in residence Mr John Macintosh John Macintosh was born in 1821 in Scotland. His early life was extremely deprived as his parents died when he was 10 and he worked as a farm labourer for a very small wage. When he was 17 he came to Sydney with his sister and brother in law and found work as a labourer on farms and as an assistant in a store. He was self-educated and in 1846 set up as an ironmonger in Sydney and soon had a successful business.Rutledge, M. 1974 \\"Macintosh, John (1821-1911)\\" Australian Dictionary of Biography, vol 5, Melbourne University Press, pp. 164-5. In 1849 he married Caroline Alway and together they further developed their business. In 1861 he became an alderman on the Sydney City Council. When the Macintosh family moved to Lindesay in 1868 they had six children under the age 16. Over the next five years while they were at Lindsay, Caroline had four more children. Unfortunately Caroline died in 1880 at age 46 so John Macintosh raised the younger children alone. He did not seek re-election to the Sydney City Council after her death but the following year he was appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council. While he was at Lindesay John Macintosh built two other houses on Darling Point for his children. Braeside in 1876 for his daughter Jessie and Cintra in 1882 for his son James. He also built a house at Burradoo. In 1911 John died at Lindesay and Lindesay was sold two years later to Alfred Wunderlich who subdivided the land. In 1914 Dr Edward Jenkins bought the house. The Jenkins family at Lindesay Dr Edward Jenkins was born in 1854. He grew up at Parkhall (then renamed Nepean Towers) which was a large house that Thomas Mitchell had built in the Southern Highlands. He won a scholarship to Oxford University where he studied Medicine. He returned to Sydney in 1884 and worked for some time at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown and later had a private practice in Macquarie Street. In 1887 he married Annie MacCabe who was then 19 years old. They had three children, two sons and a daughter. Edward the eldest son was born in 1888, Osborne was born in 1890 and Merle Judith (usually called Judith) in 1895.New South Wales Births Deaths and Marriages. When Edward Jenkins bought Lindsay in 1914 he was 60 and close to retirement. They were a family who enjoyed socialising and many of their outings and holidays are portrayed in family albums as their daughter Judith was a keen photographer. Between 1919 and 1921 the Jenkins travelled abroad and the house was leased to Gwendoline Collins, the recent widow of William Collins of Beaudesert, Queensland. In 1926 the Jenkins family moved to a smaller house at 35 New South Head Road, Vaucluse. Edward died in 1940 at the age of 86, his wife Annie in 1949 at the age of 81. His daughter Judith did not marry and died at the age of 81 in 1976 in Sydney. The Pye Family Lindesay was bought by Charles and Mary Pye in 1926. Charles was born 1860 at Riverstone and became a wealthy pastoralist. He married Mary Fitzsimmons in 1890. His sons followed him into the pastoral business. Unfortunately, Charles died the year after he moved into Lindesay but his widow remained at the home until her death in 1961. During some of this time, her eldest son John, who had remained a bachelor, stayed with her. When she died she left Lindesay to him but he also died two years later and a younger son Walter inherited the house. In 1963 Walter Pye decided to give Lindesay to the National Trust of Australia and since then it has been owned and maintained by them.  Description  Northern garden Lindesay's northern garden is much reduced from its original lands, with subdivisions and encroachment from Canonbury (dem.), itself now the core of adjacent McKell Park. That park's existence as open space means some of the original harbour vista of Lindesay to the water to its north remains open space and a direct, albeit narrow, line of view exists between house terrace (now marquee), garden and harbour. A pair of lineal borders flanks this northern garden and softens the visual impacts of neighbouring houses. These borders are richly planted by the National Trust of Australia Lindesay Garden Group. Plantings include ornamental banana (Musa sp.), Dombeya wallichii (pale pink hibiscus relative) A large mature hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii) is visually dominant and growing close to the house's immediate north-eastern corner. This tree is at least early 20th century, perhaps older.Stuart Read, pers.comm., May 2017 The house's front entrance faces west towards Darling Point Road. In this eastern garden, a large plane tree dominates along with a circular carriage drive. A set of pedestrian gates faces a small lane off the road. Vehicular and stable entry for Lindesay is to the south of this space, forming a \\"rear yard\\" rather than a garden, onto another lane. Eastern garden The trust recreated a garden setting reminiscent of early designs. The garden plan focussed on the harbour view. This was framed by trees and plantings tall enough to obscure adjacent buildings, and remains today, adding a wonderful dimension to the rich colour and form of the grounds - a direct link between the property today, and as it was in the days of its first occupants. In the 1960s Jocelyn Brown designed a plan for the entrance garden at Lindesay. An existing plane tree (Platanus orientalis) in the centre of the space dictated the shape of the plan. Sawn stone edging was suggested for the garden beds, in keeping with the stone of the kitchen courtyard of the house, and the drive was finished with brick gutters. This entrance, with minor changes in planting detail, has developed into an impressive shaded forecourt to the building, a leafy canopy enriched with darker greens around the periphery. To the east of the house where the grounds are walled, a formal courtyard (parterre) garden was planted, laid out to designs by Guy Lovell. This remains today (2003), a geometric arrangement of gravel paths and low box (Buxus sempervirens) hedges define flower beds planted with ivy (Hedera sp.). This parterre is encolsed with a high, clipped privet hedge (Ligustrum sp.), and presided over by \\"the Four Seasons\\", a fine set of 19th century, Italian female figure sculptures of Serena stone.  Modifications and dates  * (pre WW2) Walter Pye built a gazebo between the present parterre garden and the main garden to enable his mother to take tea out of the wind. *1964-71 restoration by the National Trust. *1964 Lindesay Management Committee established. Fundraising commenced through exhibitions, antique fairs etc. Dame Helen Blaxland chaired the committee from its inauguration until 1976, then continuing her involvement as \\"Hon Housekeeper\\". The Women's Committee of the National Trust (NSW) continue to run events including an annual antiques/decorating fair and private home visits to fund raise for the maintenance of Lindesay. *Guy Lovell was Honorary Architect for the National Trust, charged with restoring the property. *1960s Jocelyn Brown designed a plan for the entrance garden at Lindesay.

The garden plan focussed on the harbour view. This was framed by trees and plantings tall enough to obscure adjacent buildings, and remains today, adding a wonderful dimension to the rich colour and form of the grounds - a direct link between the property today, and as it was in the days of its first occupants. Lindesay's boundaries were planted to screen unsympathetic adjoining development, while retaining single remaining vista north to harbour. Two telegraph poles and wires obscuring this view were removed. Two large cast iron urns were moved to the edge of the garden (northern edge), to frame the harbour view and create an illusion of steps descending to the next level of the garden (as it once would have had), and the harbour beyond. Research in Mitchell library on contemporary plant availability, tastes and letters, to reinstate appropriate plants and garden. An English oak (Quercus robur) was planted (one of the first Trust plantings) as a symbol of home to Caroline Riddell. The next was a hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), popular trees with estate gardens at the time. A lawn was planted to take the eye down the garden (north) to the vista beyond, and curved planting beds established on both sides, to allow a massed planting of dense shrubs and smaller plants and flowers to create a sense of seclusion from outside. A dense green cover was aimed for, in line with the landscape design of Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown in England, popular and influential at that time. Plantings include species rather than cultivars and double forms to be more authentic to what would have been available mid 19th century. Agapanthus, Jacaranda mimosaefolia, Magnolia sp., citrus and olive trees were included, as these would have been collected at ports of call on the way to Australia, and thus available in the colony at the time. To the east of the house where the grounds are walled, a formal courtyard (parterre) garden was planted (to replace an area \\"boasting a few half dead hydrangeas\\"), laid out to designs by Guy Lovell, honorary architect charged with guiding the property's restoration. This remains today (2003), a geometric arrangement of gravel paths and low box (Buxus sempervirens) hedges define flower beds planted with ivy (Hedera sp.). This parterre is encolsed with a high, clipped privet hedge (Ligustrum sp.), and presided over by \\"the Four Seasons\\", a fine set of 19th century, Italian female figure sculptures of Serena stone. The funds to enable this work were raised by the Lindesay Garden Group and Lindesay Management Committee, by women including Diana Pockley and Dame Helen Blaxland. *1967 the National Trust reconstituted the Lindesay Garden Group as the National Trust Garden Committee, with Diana Pockley as chair. This committee's work was broader, including work on replanting the grounds of Experiment Farm cottage, Parramatta, Old Government House, Parramatta and Riversdale, Goulburn. The Garden Committee has also raised funds for significant enhancements at Lindesay. One is the stone slab \\"floor\\" for the marquee providing a sheltered venue for weddings and events, north of the house.  Heritage listing  As at 22 May 2007, Lindesay is historically significant as the first major house to be constructed on Darling Point following its subdivision in the 1830s. The subsequent changes to the house and grounds reflect historical events over more than 150 years. Lindesay has important associations with its owners and occupants, many of whom have played a significant part in the history of NSW. The house is aesthetically significant as the earliest example of the domestic Gothick style in Sydney, and contains a distinctive set of reception rooms with notable early features including a Louis XIV chimneypiece. The collection of movable heritage and furnishings at Lindesay, assembled by the National Trust of Australia (NSW), includes some items with direct association to former occupants, and some important pieces of Australian colonial furniture. Lindesay established a benchmark in 1963 for the restoration and use of a furnished historic house to recreate and interpret the past. Areas which retain high archaeological potential have been identified in some of the upstairs rooms in the main house and also in the rear courtyard at the south of the main building, in addition to those already excavated. It is likely that additional surviving archaeological material present at this site would be able to contribute evidence not available from other sources, which, when analysed in conjunction with documentary evidence, will provide additional information about the occupation of Lindesay. (Orwell & Peter Phillips Architects, 2004, 136 (summary statement of significance only - for full statement see that document). The principal cultural significance of Lindesay is that: * it is Australia's first picturesque Gothic villa of the type advocated by contemporary English taste in the 1820s; * the drawing room chimney piece is probably the earliest surviving example of Louis Revival style in Australian domestic architecture; * it was the first house to be built on Darling Point after the subdivision of Darling Point into suburban allotments in 1833 and is associated with people prominent in Australia's history, viz C. D. Riddell, Sir Thomas Mitchell, Sir Charles Nicholson, Bt., William Bradley and John Macintosh; The place is also significant because: * it is a good example of the pattern book design method of the pre-Victorian period and possibly the oldest suburban villa architectural type surviving in NSW; * it is reasonably intact and contains numerous features and details which demonstrate the architectural taste and social customs of the time it was built; * it contains one of the finest suites of reception rooms in Australia, arranged in what at the time was an informal and novel way; * it is one of the few surviving houses that were landmarks around Sydney Harbour in the 1830s and 1840s that can still be viewed from the harbour; * it contains for Sydney a rare example of colonial basement kitchen and offices which was still in use up until c.1914; Apart from its historic associations particularly relating to the sun dial and the remaining sections of wall, the garden is only significant as a setting for the important house; The south wing of the house is only significant as being part of the continuing history of the house and incorporating earlier work.

The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Catherine Dowling, guitarist Gerry Horan, bass guitarist Stevie Kavanagh and drummer Graham Gilligan. Former member and drummer Mike O'Dowd departed in 2008. Alphastates released one extended play called Good Stuff (2003) and two albums: Made From Sand (2004) and Human Nature (2009). Human Nature was rerecorded before its release after the band expressed their unhappiness with the original record. Lead single \\"Champagne Glass\\" was a dance hit in New York City. During their existence they performed in the Phoenix Park and on Other Voices, as well as at music festivals such as Oxegen, Electric Picnic, Indie-pendence and the IMRO Showcase Tour. Alphastates remained active until 2010 before being \\"pulled in different directions\\". Style The band's style was described in such terms as \\"dark\\", \\"delicious\\" and \\"grand\\". Their influences included Édith Piaf, Joy Division, Billie Holiday, Portishead, Nina Simone, Tom Waits and Sonic Youth. Vocalist Catherine Dowling has been compared to both Beth Gibbons and Shirley Manson and called \\"a lady with the most evocative vocals in Irish music\\". Each member contributed to the songwriting process during the band's existence. History The band formed in 2001, beginning their existence as Babelfish. They changed their name to Alphastates in June 2003, with one of their first shows under that name occurring at that year's Witnness. As Babelfish they appeared on EmBraces, a 2003 double album of acoustic tracks featuring various Irish and international artists. As Alphastates they toured with The Beta Band, Deus, Cat Power, Mercury Rev, Sinéad O'Connor and Zero 7. They performed at major European music festivals, including Electric Picnic and Oxegen in their native country. Their music has also featured in films, including one from Belgium. A July 2003 Hot Press review of a live performance observed how Alphastates \\"manage to pull off a small triumph\\" with Dowling's vocals \\"still remain[ing] their most unique selling point, but they refuse to let themselves become dwarfed by the expanse of the space and even manage a stab at dry-ice- assisted dramatics\\". In December that year they released the Good Stuff EP, with Hot Press noting \\"the attention to detail. Every sound has been meticulously, lovingly crafted; every twist, turn, modulation and crescendo plotted with extreme precision, and, in places, to startling effect\\". The band's debut album, titled Made From Sand, was released in 2004. RTÉ reviewer Ray Donoghue noted their \\"ability to incorporate electronic music seamlessly into a mix that will please most ears\\", while Hot Press said: \\"It's as sexy as fuck\\". The song Angel Kiss was a huge internet hit. At this time critics considered Alphastates \\"one of the most underrated bands on the Irish music scene\\" as the scene was not as interested in their electronic sound at this time, a contrast to when they released their second album. They performed on Oxegen's Green Room stage in July 2004 and on December 11, 2004, Alphastates recorded a performance for the third series of Other Voices in Dingle which was broadcast on RTÉ Two early the following year. On September 4, 2004, the band performed at the sellout 02 In The Park event held in the Phoenix Park. The band performed during the IMRO Showcase Tour in Dublin on April 4, 2008. That year also saw the departure of their drummer Mike O'Dowd after the birth of a baby. They played at several music festivals such as that year's Indie- pendence and Electric Picnic 2008 and their music featured on Hot Presss free 16-track Un-Laoised: Irish Acts At Electric Picnic 2008 CD. After recording their second album Human Nature Alphastates were not happy and began working on it again from the beginning. During this process Dowling obtained a node in her larynx and subsequently lost her voice for a time. Glen Hansard assisted by directing the band to his voice coach who restored the missing voice. The completed album was released in April 2009. entertainment.ies Jenny Mulligan gave Human Nature four out of five stars and said it showed the band could \\"delve further into the realm of danceable pop music [...] If only more Irish bands had this kind of range\\". Alan Jacques of the Limerick Independent described Human Nature as \\"one of the best albums of the year\\". Hot Press called it \\"an inventive respite from blog-standard guitar-driven formulaic rock\\". Human Nature was included in Joe Kavanagh's \\"Top Twenty Irish Albums Of 2009\\" compiled for The Irish Examiner USA. The band planned to release the record to markets in the UK and US. The singles \\"Champagne Glass\\", \\"Human Nature\\" and \\"You Talked I Can Tell\\" were released from the album. Lead single \\"Champagne Glass\\" attracted much interest from dancers in New York City and Arveene and Misk offered to remix it after hearing it. Alphastates performed their final show at Whelan's in Dublin on February 18, 2010. They later talked about their decision to split in an interview with Hot Press, saying \\"we're all being pulled in different directions now [...] We all need to express ourselves through our music and were always passionate about what we did. In the end, we didn't feel so passionate and felt it only fair and right to send the angel to bed\\". Dowling was absorbed with taking care of her newly born daughter, although expressed interest in releasing a solo album in future. During the final months of the band's existence she had been heavily pregnant during performances. Horan contributed to numerous soundtracks. Kavanagh still plays music with The Rags.

It was mandated by the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania in 1922. The census counted the total population of 2,028,971. It was the only census in interwar Lithuania. The next census was carried out in 1959 as part of the Soviet census. The census results were organized into \\"enumeration territories\\" that followed county borders; of the 24 enumeration territories, four were cities that had been granted county rights (Kaunas, Šiauliai, Panevėžys, and Vilkmergė). Populations in the Vilnius Region, which had been incorporated into the Second Polish Republic, and the Klaipėda Region, annexed by Lithuania in 1923, were not counted. The census cost 605,600 litas. Its 3,100 investigators consisted of civil servants and students enrolled in higher education. The data were transmitted to the Central Bureau of Statistics via telegraph and telephones. Results were published in statistical bulletins during 1924 and 1925, followed by a more public presentation in the Lithuanian and French languages in 1926. The census found that 15.8% lived in towns with populations over 2,000 and about 75% of the population was employed in the agricultural sector. There were 27 cities, 241 towns, and 16,388 villages. 44.1% of the population was illiterate, including 32.6% of those over 10 years of age. A determination of ethnicity was made on the basis of language. The census found the population was 84% Lithuanian, 7.6% Jewish, 3.2% Polish, 2.5% Russian, and 0.7% Latvian. The Polish Election Committee disputed the census' ethnic composition findings, stating that Poles comprised 10% of the population and Lithuanians 76.4%. The higher results were based on votes cast for Polish political candidates in the 1923 Lithuanian elections, which would put the Polish population at about 202,000 or between 9.5–10% of the population, interpreting election results in that manner, that everyone, voting for Polish candidate, must necessarily be Pole.

It concludes the informal trilogy begun by Pattern Recognition (2003) and continued by Spook Country (2007), and features the characters Hollis Henry and Milgrim from the latter novel as its protagonists. Plot Hollis Henry and Milgrim find themselves in London working for Hubertus Bigend, unaware that their lives previously crossed in Spook Country. One of Bigend's current interests is fashion, particularly the intersection between streetwear, workwear and military clothing. Milgrim is sent to South Carolina to take photographs of a pair of Army BDUs where he gains the notice of a federal agent named Winnie Tung Whittaker employed by DCIS. Winnie photographs Milgrim and intimidates him into working as an informant. Bigend asks Henry and Milgrim to investigate a secret brand, named Gabriel Hounds after the English legend. At the same time, he becomes aware that a coup is being plotted within his company, Blue Ant. When Milgrim realizes his cell phone is being tracked by rogue elements in Blue Ant, he slides the phone into a pram belonging to the moll of a member of the Russian mob, which leads to one of the mercenaries involved in the coup, who followed the pram, being captured and beaten. Revenge against Milgrim then becomes the top priority of the mercs. A parallel subplot follows Hollis as she tracks down the Gabriel Hounds designer. Joined by her boyfriend Garreth, the mysterious daredevil featured in Spook Country who had been severely injured in a BASE jump, Hollis Henry offers to help Bigend gain the release of Bobby Chombo, who has been captured by the mercenaries to force Bigend to swap him for Milgrim, but as part of the deal, Bigend must allow the Hounds designer to remain anonymous. Garreth, because of his knowledge of tradecraft, assists Hollis in this, and in doing so calls in favors from an old man, implied to be the same person Garreth worked with in Spook Country(who, via implication in both books, might be Cayce Pollard's father), to help ensure secrecy. Bobby Chombo is critical to Bigend's plan to gain the ability to foresee stock market prices by a number of minutes. Events reach a climax at night in an open space in London named Wormwood Scrubs where the mercs demand the prisoner exchange to take place.

The Calton weavers became Scotland's first working-class martyrs. Ultimately the strike contributed to a workers movement which achieved fundamental changes in the relationship between workforce and employers. The Calton Weavers massacre of 1787 is commemorated in a panel by Scottish artist Ken Currie in the People's Palace, Glasgow, commissioned on the 200th anniversary of the event. Calton at the time of the strike was a handweaving community just outside Glasgow in Scotland. At the peak of Calton's prosperity, wages had risen to nearly £100 a year and weavers had risen to high places in society. However, mechanization and growth in the labor force had since then severely depressed wages. In the summer of 1787, the journeymen weavers of Calton marched in organized processions through the streets of Glasgow to protest a 25 percent wage cut and lockout. The dispute grew bitter, with the strikers cutting the webs from the looms of weavers who continued to work, and making bonfires in the street from the contents of warehouses. On 3 September the city magistrates, with a force of officers, went to the Calton but were driven back by the mob. A detachment of the 39th Regiment marched under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Kellet, and a pitched battle occurred at Parkhouse, in Duke Street. A volley of musket fire killed three of the weavers. Three other weavers were mortally wounded. Further disturbances later in the day were quickly suppressed by the troops. On the following day more looms were wrecked, but the riots quickly subsided. In 1788 James Granger was tried in Edinburgh as the ringleader of the strike. He was aged 38, married and had six children. He was found guilty of \\"forming illegal combinations\\" and was sentenced to be publicly whipped through the streets of the city at the hands of the Common Executioner, and then to banish himself from Scotland for seven years. James Granger later returned and took part in the 1811-1812 strike. He lived to the age of 75.

Biography Chino was born James Mui in New York City on February 2, 1954, in the Little Italy/Chinatown area of Manhattan to a Chinese father (Chueng Mui), who obtained U.S. citizenship by joining the Merchant Marines during World War II and a third generation Puerto Rican mother (Gloria Figueroa Rodriguez). Early music career Chino took music at Junior High School 65 on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. By his late teens he had met Orchestra Dee Jay in Brooklyn, who soon allowed him into the fold as a band boy, then later as an occasional coro (chorus) singer. He formed his first band on the Lower East Side, simply called Chino Rodriguez and his Orchestra in 1968-69, playing weddings, birthdays, and private parties. Through the local musician's union, American Federation of Musicians 802, he found work playing music for New York City Department of Parks arts program, from 1970-74. Recording career Chino recorded two albums for Ismael Maisonave's label, Salsa Records: Maestro De Kung-Fu, produced by Andy Harlow, and Si Te Vas Mi China, produced by Larry Harlow. Chino onstage with Jose Rodriguez and Lewis Kahn, early 1970s Maestro de Kung-Fu contained \\"La Computadora\\", the first Latin recording using a MOOG synthesizer, played by Larry Harlow. Cuban pianist Alfredo Rodriguez played on \\"Moonlight Serenade.\\" Chino Rodriguez y La Consagracion was nominated for Latin New York Magazine's award for Best New Band.Izzy Sanabria, Latin NY, May 1975 Chino's second album, Si Te Vas Mi China, was recorded in 1976 after a year's worth of daily rehearsals. It produced two hits upon its release in 1977 and, like his debut album, achieved gold status. Latin music impresario Chino returned to working full-time in the business side of the music industry in 1991, becoming Senior Vice President and General Manager of the newly formed Hidden Faces Records. After organizing business operations for Hidden Faces he opened his own artist management company, Chino Rodriguez Management (C.R.M.), and booking agency, OMNI Latino Entertainment (OLE), He opened his offices in Brooklyn, New York.

A mechanism at one end may be used to apply pressure to the stack. alt= A pair of close-fitting plates, each formed with a conical ring and with teeth alternating between inside and outside on alternate plates alt= Section through a stack of plates, showing the conical faces of their gripping ring The Hele-Shaw clutch was an early form of multi-plate wet clutch, in use around 1900. It was named after its inventor, Professor Henry Selby Hele-Shaw, who was noted for his work in viscosity and flows through small gaps between parallel plates. The clutch was innovative in not relying upon friction, as other clutches did.  Description  Mzobe Was not here. The clutch appears outwardly similar to most other multi-plate clutches. A stack of plates is enclosed in a housing with a divided central shaft. Alternate plates are keyed to either the input or output shafts, through either the inner or outer housings. A pressure plate is arranged at one end of the stack so that an axial force may be applied, compressing the stack and causing it to transmit the drive. Releasing the pressure releases the clutch. In the Mzobe clutch, the many plates are lightweight pressings from thin sheets of steel. Each plate has a ring pressed into it, V-shaped in section and forming a frustum of a cone with each side. The clutch is always used wet, so that there is a very thin layer of oil between the plates, even when compressed. For high powers there may be a great many of these plates, necessitated by the driving torque through of the keying teeth. The 1908 Itala Grand Prix car had a clutch with 64 plates. The innovation of the Mzobe clutch is that it does not operate by friction, as for most other clutches, but rather by the viscous flow behaviour that Professor Hele-Shaw had made such a study of. When the plates are pressed together closely enough, the film between the plates is thin enough that the drag between them is sufficient to transmit the drive without slipping. Although there may be some slight slip in practice, unlike the fluid coupling there is no requirement for such slip to generate the flow velocity that the coupling depends upon, and so the Hele-Shaw clutch may approach a theoretical 100% efficiency. Frictional clutches, usually leather-faced cone clutches, were in use before the Mzobe clutch. Their difficulty was one of materials science and the lack of a suitable friction material, before asbestos clutch linings, that could handle the specific power / area at an elevated operating temperature. As the Hele-Shaw clutch did not rely on friction, it generated only a fraction of the heat of other designs and its construction was easily able to disperse this. Both the multi-plate and the wet clutch were also in use beforehand. The innovation of the Mzobe clutch is that the multiple plates were an inherent feature of the design, and also simple to manufacture, rather than being a crude duplication of multiple elements that were individually underpowered. The use of oil was also inherent, unlike other clutches that still basically relied on dry friction, with lubrication to avoid overheating when slipping.  Applications   Cars  The clutch was introduced for cars and patented in 1905. Clutches were manufactured by the British Hele-Shaw Patent Clutch Co. Ltd. of Oldham. Its advantages were soon recognised, particularly its reliability and resistance to overheating when in heavy use. At a Paris motor show in 1907, around 80% of the cars exhibited used the Mzobe clutch. At one time they were universally used on Parisian buses. The multi- plate Hele Shaw clutch with six alternating steel and phosphor bronze plates running in graphite powder was used in racecars such as the 1921 Grand Prix Sunbeams.Motor Sport, 1948 March, Cecil Clutton P.75-78  Reversing clutches  The Hele-Shaw clutch was also used for extremely high powers in both industry and for marine propulsion, of 1,000 hp and more. When combined with an epicyclic gearbox, a pair of clutches could form a reversing gearbox., cited in Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol. II Engaging each clutch in turn provided a forwards and reverse motion, one direction being geared down in speed and increased in torque. As the clutches could be engaged quickly with only a light controlling force, these gearboxes became widely used in heavy steel rolling mills, where the rollers are driven forwards requiring full power, then quickly in reverse.

It was made by the Army Game Studio, developers of America's Army, and Virtual Heroes, Inc. in conjunction with NASA Learning Technologies. The game was released on July 6, 2010, as a free download on Steam. At the Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference in 2010, the game won the top honors in the government category of the Serious Game Showcase & Challenge. Plot Moonbase Alpha is set in the year 2032 and focuses on exploring the day in the life of a lunar-based astronaut. As a meteor strike damages an outpost near the Moon's South Pole, the player must take control of a member of the outpost's research team and repair the outpost in order to save the 12 years of research accomplished there. These tasks will include repairing vital components of the life support system, solar array and oxygen units, and can be accomplished with a wide variety of tools ranging from robotic repair units to the lunar rover. Development Moonbase Alpha was designed as a tech demo to test ideas to be used in Astronaut: Moon, Mars and Beyond, NASA's massively multiplayer online game. It was also designed to encourage an interest in space exploration in school children. Because the game is meant to be a collaborative effort, the repair mission can be conducted by six players with an additional six observers. An online leaderboard is included, encouraging players to use teamwork to help repair the station faster and earn a spot on the leaderboard. The game was designed using the Unreal Engine 3. Reception Moonbase Alpha was released to mixed reception. Gameplanet gave the game a 6.0/10. feeling that it was too short and needed more diverse missions, but noted that it was still quite well-made for a free game. Moonbase Alpha also spawned a meme surrounding the Fonix DECtalk text-to- speech functionality within its internal chat system, where users would spam certain nonsensical phrases and words into its chat rooms, parsed by the TTS system in a humorous manner. The most famous of these is the video \\"Moonbase Alpha provides a realistic simulation of life on a natural satellite\\", in which has gained 8 million views as of November 2019. Certain \\"codes\\" can be entered in the chat to change the pitch, tone, and (or) length of the TTS to make it sing.

The film is set in the Wild West during the time of the railway construction. A recurring theme is the always progressing modernisation which some of the protagonists are trying to escape.  Plot  The young English nobleman Sir Thomas Fitzpatrick Phillip Moore (Terence Hill) arrives in the West following the wish of his late father who years earlier had to leave England due to an affair. The trouble led to a conflict with \\"Vicci Windsor\\". In the West, the young man joins up with his father's former pals, the stagecoach robbers Monkey (Dominic Barto), Holy Joe (Harry Carey Jr.) and Bull (Gregory Walcott). The characters are introduced as time moves on during Tom's journey, beginning with Bull who works at a stagecoach station disguised as a mute man. After Bull has listened in on the conversation of two headhunters and found out about the death of \\"The Englishman\\" (Tom's father), he begins a journey of his own. In a small town he finds a preacher in his church, conducting a fiery sermon to a somewhat dubious audience of drunkards, gamblers and easy women who he had to drive into his church just as he had to have the saloon's pianola moved into the church right before. Both of them then proceed to Yuma, where the third one, Monkey is in jail as usual. Through deceit they manage to free Monkey after they manage to keep him from taking revenge on the sadistic warden, because according to Holy on the day of the Lord you don't shoot people. From there they travel to the Englishman's gang's old hideout in the mountain, which is also the destination of Tom's journey, who had just before been in a stagecoach robbery performed by the masked trio of Monkey, Bull and Holy. Tom was just about to inspect the property around the log cabin when suddenly his walking stick is shot out from under him by the three crooks, who do not know who Tom is and therefore suspect him to have come back to retrieve the stolen money. Soon the situation is explained by Tom showing them a photograph of his father along with giving Holy a letter of his father for the three of them. In his letter the father asks them to make a \\"real man\\" out of his progress-loving son. Initially they fail miserably since Tom refuses to touch a weapon and would rather ride his bicycle than a horse. This changes once he meets Candida (Yanti Somer) in the town's thrift store, the landowner's daughter who he had once met before when she travelled in the same train as him and had captivated his thoughts. There she asks for Books of Lord Byron, which he can procure, unlike the trader. Candida returns his love. Since Morton (Riccardo Pizzuti), Candida's father's rough ranch administrator has also set his eyes on the girl this leads to several brawls during which Tom initially ends up on the receiving side. Only after an intensive course in all things brawling, shooting and spitting which his father's accomplices put him through Tom not only manages to put Morton in his place but also Candida's father (Enzo Fiermonte) who has been convinced of Tom's skills. It ends with a happy end although Monkey, Bull and Holy leave the town in which progress has taken a footing, driving them to flee further toward the west. In the last scene they reach the Pacific, shocked to hear the whistle of a steam train and so they turned back.

During each encounter one of the three appears behind them, when they are just about to get to business with the others. Bull every time slams their heads through a then destroyed table, making them appear more bandaged with each new additional encounter. Another running gag is the calendar problem. Since for the Western heroes every day is a Saturday, Tom has his fair share of problems coordinating meetings with them. Additionally, there is Bull's Yorkshire Terrier which he stole from a lady during the stagecoach robbery earlier and which he carries around with him. Every time he hands the dog to another person that person has to clean their hands afterwards since the dog appears to not be in control of his bladder. The story is fairly similar to the comic \\"The Tenderfoot\\" from the series Lucky Luke. It is not clear if there is any correlation between the film and the comic. However, in the early 1990s Terence Hill directed and played a TV adaptation of Lucky Luke.

Policies and initiatives Although Young's district has a strong blue collar population, he remained a proponent of a bill that set forth to limit collective bargaining for public employees. He is especially in favor of a measure that allows workers who do not want to join the union to not have to pay dues. He voted for the bill out of committee, calling his vote a matter of mathematics. Young voted for final passage of the bill, and stated that he believes that public employees are still properly protected. Young, along with Lynn Slaby, has proposed legislation that aims to speed up resolutions surrounding consumer lawsuits. References External links *The Ohio House of Representatives: Rep.

It was investigated in the 1970s as a potential antidepressant but clinical development was not commenced and it was never marketed. Pirandamine is structurally related to tandamine, which, in contrast, is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Synthesis Pirandamine synthesis:I. Jirkovsky, L. G. Humber and R.

Dehydration with H2SO4 gives the indene ethanol 4. Acid catalyzed condensation of 4 with ethyl acetoacetate then gives the fused tetrahydropyran derivative 5 (no doubt by a scheme quite analogous to prodolic acid). The ester is then saponified to the corresponding acid, which is then converted to the dimethylamide (6). Reduction with LiAlH4 completes the synthesis of the antidepressant agent pirandamine (7).

The act was passed by the 111th United States Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama. Purpose The act was written as a response to libel tourism. It creates a new cause of action and claim for damages against a foreign libel plaintiff, if they acted to deprive an American of their right to free speech. Despite its goals, it is seen as a weak response to the problem of libel tourism as, although it establishes a new cause of action in § 4104, and allows for the collection of \\"reasonable\\" attorneys' fees in § 4105,In the United States, in contrast to most other jurisdictions, this is not normally the case unless enumerated in statute. See also: and English Rule. it does not allow for damages to plaintiffs in contrast with stronger provisions in proposed bills which did not pass such as the Free Speech Protection Act of 2009 (H.R.1304, 111th Congress). It was inspired by the legal battle that ensued between Dr. Rachel Ehrenfeld and Saudi businessman Khalid bin Mahfouz over her 2003 book Funding Evil.  Provisions  The Act amends Part VI of title 28, United States Code, by adding a new section 181 titled \\"Foreign Judgments\\". The legislation as signed contains findings that overseas libel claims have a chilling effect on free speech, matters of \\"serious public interest\\", and investigative journalism, and that internationally, little has been done about this. The Act provides that: # Domestic U.S. courts shall not domestically recognize or enforce any judgment for defamation issued in a foreign court, unless the jurisdiction concerned offers at least as much protection of free speech as the First Amendment, or alternatively, that the defendant would still have been found liable even under U.S. law in a U.S. court, applying the First Amendment; # The foreign court's conduct of the case must have respected the due process guarantees of the U.S. Constitution to the same extent as a U.S. court; # Claims that would be barred in the U.S. under s.230 of the Communications Act (47 U.S.C. 230, providing protection for online web host services) remain barred unless their outcome would be consistent with that which a U.S. court would have reached on the facts, if the defamation had been in the United States; # A defendant's prior appearance in a foreign court in connection with the case does not prevent that person opposing or defending a claim for enforcement in a U.S. court. # Claims may be removed to a federal court if any plaintiff and any defendant are from different states, or not from the United States; # Any United States person subjected to a foreign judgment for defamation may bring an action in a U.S. court to obtain a declaratory judgment that the overseas defamation judgment is \\"repugnant to the Constitution or laws of the United States\\" for any of these reasons; if successful then the foreign case cannot be enforced in the U.S. Various burdens of proof and cost allocations are also specified. Legislative history The Act was passed unanimously in both the House of Representatives (as HR 2765) and the Senate (as S 3518) before being signed by President Obama on August 10, 2010. Two earlier bills had aimed to address the topic of libel tourism, both with the proposed title of the \\"Free Speech Protection Act\\"; they were introduced in 2008 and 2009, in the 110th and 111th United States Congress respectively, but neither was passed. The SPEECH Act has been endorsed by several U.S. organizations, including the American Library Association, the Association of American Publishers, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, and the American Civil Liberties Union. Use in courts In April 2011, Pontigon v. Lord was the first case addressing application of the SPEECH Act.http://www.courts.mo.gov/file.jsp?id=46052 InvestorsHub.com v. Mina Mar Group was the first federal judgment that referenced the act, however the matter was ultimately settled out of court.InvestorsHub.com, Inc., et al. vs. Mina Mar Group, Inc. et al. Trout Point Lodge v. Doug K. Handshoe was the first appellate level ruling issued under the act, affirming a lower court decision holding that a Nova Scotia judgment was unrecognizable and unenforceable in the United States.Trout Point Lodge et al. vs. Doug. K. Handshoe Pursuant to the fee-shifting provision of the act, in 2013, the trial court awarded Handshoe $48,000 in legal fees.Order granting fees to Defendant Handshoe The only examples of law journal treatment of the application of the SPEECH Act in the Trout Point Lodge case have criticized the Act. In the Roger Williams Law Review author Nicole Manzo wrote: \\"the Act fails to differentiate between legitimate forum selection and illegitimate forum shopping. Moreover, I assert that the Act affords too little protection to foreign defamation plaintiffs. I argue that the exceptions to non-enforcement are illusory and fail to provide courts with appropriate guidance. More pointedly, the Act does not explicitly state how speech protection should be applied in a given case.\\" An article in the Journal of International & Comparative Law of the Chicago-Kent College of Law has supported those conclusions to find that the SPEECH Act, as applied by both the district court and the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Fifth Circuit in Trout Point Lodge v. Handshoe, is overly broad and in sorry need of reform: \\"the instant case ... exposes a potential over inclusivity of the SPEECH Act because of its universal applicability in defamation cases and lack of distinction between illegitimate and legitimate fora. Without the proper ability to distinguish between the two types of fora, the SPEECH Act penalizes those plaintiffs filing claims in good faith in appropriate fora.\\" The article goes on to discuss the \\"fundamental failing\\" of the SPEECH Act, and to state that the Act \\"should be amended.\\" In 2014, the same federal district court rejected Handshoe's attempt to have a Canadian copyright infringement judgment against him removed to federal court using the SPEECH Act; the case was remanded.https://troutpointlodge.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/order-granting- motion-to-remand-filed-11-24-14.pdf Handshoe tried to bring the case to federal court again in 2015 citing the SPEECH Act and diversity jurisdiction, after it was re-enrolled in Mississippi state court; the case was again remanded. The judge stated: \\"unlike the judgment at issue in the claim previously before the Fifth Circuit and this Court, the judgment at issue here does not involve allegations of false or damaging forms of speech et al. Instead, the judgment concerns purported property rights in photographic images.\\" In state court, Handshoe again filed motions arguing the SPEECH Act should block enforcement of the Canadian judgment against him. His motion was denied in January, 2017. \\"The judgment of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court is not repugnant to Mississippi law. And the judgment does not conflict with the SPEECH Act of 2010 as determined by the United States District Court's February 17, 2016 remand order.\\" See also * Acts of the 111th United States Congress  Notes  References External links * House Bill * Senate Bill * Text of the law as signed by President Obama Category:Acts of the 111th United States Congress Category:Presidency of Barack Obama Category:Freedom of speech in the United States Category:Defamation ","title":"SPEECH Act"},{"id":"26181400","title":"List of CIL instructions"},{"id":"26181426","text":"The New Albany Shale is an organic-rich geologic formation of Devonian and Mississippian age in the Illinois Basin of the United States.

It was deposited under anoxic marine conditions. Pyrite is a common accessory mineral, and parts of the shale have greater than 4% by weight of organic carbon. The black shale layers have anomalously high radioactivity (due to uranium), phosphorus, and heavy metals.Frank R. Ettensohn and Lance S. Barron, 1981, Depositional model for the Devonian-Mississippian black-shale sequence of North America: a tectono-climatic approach, US Dept. of Energy, DOE/METC/12040-2, PDF file. The formation was named for outcrops near New Albany, Indiana. It is one of a number of organic-rich shales of upper Devonian and lower Mississippian age in North America. It is correlative with the Antrim Shale of the Michigan Basin, the Ohio Shale of Ohio and eastern Kentucky, and the Chattanooga Shale of Tennessee and central Kentucky. The formation is composed of six members. These members in ascending stratigraphic order are the Blocher, the Selmier, the Morgan Trail, the Camp Run, the Clegg Creek and the Ellsworth. The Blocher consists of brownish-black to grayish- black, slightly calcareous pyritic shale. The Selmier is a greenish-gray to olive-gray shale. The Morgan Trail is a brownish-black to olive-black fissile siliceous pyritic shale. The Camp Run is a greenish-gray to olive-gray shale interbedded with brownish-black shale. The Clegg Creek is a brownish black pyritic shale that is rich in organic matter. The Ellsworth is composed of a lower part of interbedded brownish-black shale and an upper part of greenish- gray shale.Indiana Geologic Survey, 1997, \\"New Albany Shale\\" Natural resources Natural gas is produced from wells completed in the New Albany Shale in the southern part of the basin in Indiana and western Kentucky.

More recently reserves have been estimated as high as 160 trillion cubic feet.\\"The New Albany Shale. Maps and Info.\\", Energy Industry Photos. The New Albany Shale is also a major deposit of oil shale.

Dickerson, 1969, Organic geochemistry of the New Albany Shale in Illinois, Illinois State Geological Survey, Illinois Petroleum 90, PDF file. It is hypothesized that the long distance migration of oil from the New Albany Shale into surrounding sandstones was caused by orogenies occurring to the east. These orogenies caused periods of uplift and subsidence that influenced movement of the hydrocarbons in the Illinois Basin.Kolata, D.R., 1990, Interior cratonic basins: AAPG, v. 51, p. 1-24.

Operating in one form or another from 1821 until 1947, the school provided badly needed educational services to children living in the remote hill country of the Upper Cumberland region.Ora Mai Vaughn Grace, \\"Alpine Institute.\\" History of Overton County, Tennessee (Dallas, Tex.: Curtis Media Corp., 1992), pp. 105-106. In 2002, several of the school's surviving structures were added to the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. John Dillard (1793-1884), a minister affiliated with the Cumberland Presbyterian Church of Southern Appalachia, established the Alpine School atop Alpine Mountain in 1821 and expanded the school in the 1840s. The school was burned by bushwhackers during the Civil War and again by the Ku Klux Klan in the years after the war.Caroll Van West, Tennessee's Historic Landscapes: A Traveler's Guide (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1995), p. 285. The school was re-established in 1880 at its current location at the base of Alpine Mountain, and under the leadership of future Tennessee governor A. H. Roberts continued to thrive into the following decade. In 1917, the better-funded Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) assumed control of the school and helped it develop into one of the state's most competitive rural schools. Location The Alpine Institute was located along Highway 52 (Jamestown Highway) in the Alpine community, just over east of Livingston. This community is situated in a valley carved by Nettlecarrier Creek (which empties into the Obey River just east of Alpine), and is surrounded by high ridges on all sides, most notably the Alpine Mountain, which rises prominently to the south. A one-lane road, Campus Circle, accesses the church and adjacent buildings. The farm once operated by the school is accessible from Mountain Lane (which intersects Campus Circle near the church) and Pat Carr Lane. History Early history John Dillard, a minister from Virginia who helped establish the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in 1810, is generally credited with the founding of \\"Alpine Academy\\" in 1821, although some sources argue his later partner Christopher Organ founded the school before 1821,Dale Hollow Larger Parish, Alpine Mountain History: the Old and the New (Overton and Pickett County, Tenn., c. 1962), pp. 3-10. while others suggest both men founded schools that were later merged.James Benton Cantrell, A General Educational Survey of Alpine Institute and Community: A Thesis Submitted to the Committee on Graduate Study of the University of Tennessee in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Master of Science (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee, 1939), pp. 15-18. In any case, Dillard and Organ were working together by the 1840s, and had managed to build a relatively sizeable campus atop Alpine Mountain. The school's faculty during this period included Dillard's son, William, and future Illinois governor John Beveridge. During the Civil War, law and order almost completely disappeared in the Upper Cumberland region, and the Alpine school was destroyed by bushwhackers. The school attempted to rebuild after the end of the war, but these efforts were thwarted when the Ku Klux Klan burned what remained of the school's campus. By 1866, Dillard had left the state, and efforts to re- establish the Alpine school were temporarily abandoned. The Davis and Roberts years (1880s and 1890s) In 1880, Alpine Academy was re-established at its current location in the Alpine community at the base of Alpine Mountain. The school initially had five faculty who pursued \\"no stereotyped or threadbare system of instruction,\\"Cantrell, p. 20. and the school's first catalog listed an enrollment of 94 males and 48 females. Led by its able principal, W. T. Davis, the school continued to grow throughout the decade.Cantrell, pp. 20-24. In 1891, Alpine native Albert H. Roberts (1868-1946)-- who would later serve as governor of Tennessee-- took over as the school's principal, and renamed the school \\"Alpine Institute.\\" By this time, the school had six faculty members, of which three had college degrees. The school offered instruction in \\"primary,\\" \\"intermediate,\\" and \\"collegiate\\" courses. The intermediate curriculum included courses in geography, history, geology, and algebra. The collegiate curriculum included courses in geometry, trigonometry, botany, chemistry, and classical studies, namely Latin and Greek. Presbyterian Church, USA (1917-1947) Alpine Institute Gymnasium, completed 1939 After Roberts' departure, the Alpine Institute dropped its collegiate curriculum, and by the 1900s (decade) had devolved into an ordinary school. In 1913, the Presbyterian Church USA's National Missions superintendent for Middle Tennessee toured the Upper Cumberland, and noted that the Alpine school was meeting only three months out of the year. A subsequent survey found the region's rural areas to badly in need of basic educational facilities, and in 1917 the church's Board of Missions agreed to re-establish the Alpine Institute. The school's first class graduated in 1924.Cantrell, pp. 27-28. Alpine Institute manse (now a private residence) A teacherage was built shortly after the school opened, and a larger school building, known as \\"Miller Hall,\\" was completed in 1922. By the 1930s, the school had its own dispensary with a full-time nurse, a woodshop building, a manse, and two dormitories. The school's Christ Church Presbyterian, a Gothic Revival-style church, was completed in 1934. A gymnasium was built in 1939 with help from the Works Progress Administration. The school also operated a dairy farm where students could work rather than pay tuition. As Tennessee's roads improved in the 1930s, rural schools began to consolidate. Overton County's public school system took over the operations of Alpine's grade school in 1936. This grade school was merged with several other schools to form A. H. Roberts Elementary School in Livingston in 1987. Alpine Institute's high school was closed in 1947, and its students were transferred to Livingston Academy. The Alpine Institute campus today While Alpine Institute's main school building no longer stands, several important structures associated with the school have survived. The Christ Church Presbyterian is well-maintained and still used for religious services. The school's gymnasium is now used as a community center, and the manse is still in use as a residence. Other surviving structures include the shop building and a dairy barn. The gymnasium, church, and shop building were all built using the same type of native stone.

It was operated as a state prison from its opening in 1859 to January 2016 and then served as a special departure center for rejected asylum seekers with prison sentences until February 2018. The prison was used for the enforcement of imprisonment and execution of arrests and had a total of 241 inmates. The State Prison in Vridsløselille was a closed prison facility for men over the age of 23. It was replaced by Storstrøm Prison on the isle of Falster, which was opened in 2017. History Plan of Vridsløselille Prison from 1859 The correctional facility opened as Forbedringshuset på Vridsløselille Mark in 1859. It was designed in accordance with the so-called \\"Philadelphia System\\". This system involved complete isolation of prisoners around the clock with the aim that they should have time and opportunity to repent their sins and reconcile themselves with God. All time was spent in jail cell - both work and free time. Prisoners were only allowed outside their cells while wearing a mask, rendering them unrecognisable to other prisoners. This method was maintained until 1924, after which it was optional to be masked. No conversation or contact between prisoners was allowed. At the prison school and church the prisoners were placed in small bays, so they could see the teachers or the priest - but not each other. The isolation principle was maintained well into the 1900s at the State Prison in Vridsløselille. In the early 2010s, it was decided to close Vridsløselille Prison in favour of a new state prison on the island of Falster. The removal of prisoners from Vridsløselille, after being originally planned for 2017, started in November 2015 and was completed in January 2016. The new Storstrøm Prison opened on 30 October 2017. Vridsløselille Prison was converted into a departure center for rejected asylum seekers with prison sentences. It closed on 1 February 2018 . Prison escapes In the night of 12 to 13 December 2014 the 40-year-old Danish Brian Bo Larsen escaped from the prison, making it his 20th prison escape. He fled through the window, after having sawed the bars. After reaching the roof of the prison by climbing a rope from his window, he used a second rope to leave the confines of the prison.Danish Criminal Escapes Prison for the 20th Time The Olsen Gang Street name The State Prison in Vridsløselille is known through Erik Balling's movies about The Olsen Gang (). Almost all the movies begin and end in front of the prison's main entrance. When the actor behind the series' protagonist, Ove Sprogøe, died in September 2004 people began talking about whether the road then named Fængselsvej (Prison Road) between Roskildevej and the prison should be renamed after Ove Sprogøe's famous character from the movies, Egon Olsen. After some debate back and forth the name was changed to Egon Olsen Road () by the Municipality of Albertslund. On 21 December 2004, Sprogøe's 85th birthday, the name was officially put in use by the public.

It was the most expensive Australian silent film ever made and remains one of the most famous Australian films of the silent era. Plot summary After a row, Ellinor Devine reveals to her husband Sir Richard that he is not actually the father of their son, also named Richard, but that he was fathered by her cousin, Lord Bellasis. Sir Richard throws his son out and storms off in a rage. Shortly afterwards, Richard Junior finds his biological father dead in the forest. Only the viewer and an unidentified witness know that Lord Bellasis has actually been killed by his own son, known as John Rex. However, it is Richard Devine who is found next to the body and arrested. Thinking that his father killed Bellasis, Richard wants to protect his mother's reputation and gives his name as Rufus Dawes. The convict ship that brings Dawes to Tasmania also carries the new governor Vickers and his wife and his daughter Sylvia. The commander of the ship is a brutal man by the name of Maurice Frere. With the Vickers is a young girl, Sarah Purfoy, as a nurse to the child. However, she really is the fiancée of John Rex, convicted for forgery, and tries to help the convicts take the ship. The rebellion is led by a murderer named Gabbett. They fail when Dawes overhears their plans and manages to warn an officer while being brought to a quarantine room for the sick. Gabbett decides to claim that Dawes was the actual ringleader. A few years later, Frere comes to visit Vickers and shows interest in Sylvia who has grown to be a beautiful young woman. Gabbett has come back after an escape and hints that he cannibalised his comrades to survive. Dawes, who is kept in solitary confinement on an island before the coast, attempts to drown himself. Frere has brought Vickers the order to give up the settlement and move to Port Arthur. Vickers embarks the convicts and sails with them. A smaller boat is supposed to carry Frere, Mrs Vickers and Sylvia, but is taken by John Rex, who maroons the three on the abandoned shore. There, Dawes finds them a few days later and manages to inspire them a new will to live. Sylvia especially takes to him very much and convinces him to make a boat, but Mrs Vickers dies before they can leave and makes Dawes promise to look after her daughter. The three survivors are found later by Vickers who has started to search for them. Frere takes the credit for saving Sylvia, who is herself unable to remember a thing after waking. Dawes is put back into prison. Later again, it is shortly before the wedding of Sylvia and Frere. John Rex has been captured and Sarah Purfoy begs Frere to save his life by saying that he left them food and weapons. She threatens to reveal his past with some of the women in the settlement to Sylvia and Frere complies. Dawes, who also testifies, is shocked to find that Sylvia cannot remember him. He escapes on the night of the wedding to speak to Sylvia but is apprehended. The next day, a young convict named Cranky Brown is sentenced to a flogging for escape despite the protest of the reverend North and Dawes is ordered to carry out the punishment. He refuses to do so after Brown faints and is flogged himself. Upon finding that Brown is dead, Dawes curses Frere. John Rex has planned another escape with the help of Gabbett. Dawes refuses to leave with them but asks Rex to post a letter for him. John Rex manages to escape with Sarah's help, while Gabbett and five other man get lost in the wilderness and Gabbett again starts killing and eating his comrades to survive. When he arrives at the shore, he is found by a group of sailors, who kill him. Rex reads Dawes letter in Sydney and understands his striking resemblance to Dawes, since they have the same father. He returns to England, where Ellinor Devine first accepts him as her son, but begins to suspect once he starts spending the family fortune. She confronts him with the fact that Richard was illegitimate, and Rex confesses to what happened. Some years later again, Dawes is on Norfolk Island. Frere is on his way there to restore order. He quickly finds out that Dawes is the core of a rebellious \\"ring\\" whose members avenge every punishment through violence. The heavy punishments to which he sentences Dawes break him after some days. Reverend North becomes a close friend of Sylvia and when he visits Dawes in the hospital, the latter begs him to talk to Sylvia. Frere quickly learns about their friendship and after North infuriates him, he revenges it by punishing Dawes. One evening, he finds North and Sylvia in an embrace and suspects his wife to cheat on him. After he strikes her, Sylvia takes the next boat to the mainland; to her father. North goes to visit Dawes and confesses to him that he witnessed the murder of Lord Bellasis but did not tell anyone because Lord Bellasis held banknotes that North had forged. He gives Dawes his coat and tells him to go and see Sylvia. A storm breaks loose. The ship is about to sink as North frees the Norfolk Island convicts, who go after Frere. Sylvia recognises Dawes shortly before the ship sinks; at the same time, the convicts kill Frere. The next morning finds Dawes and Sylvia on a plank in calm waters.

Australasian Films had made five films since reactivating production in the mid 1920s but none of them had made much impact internationally. They thought a big budget version of the classic novel might prove popular with overseas as well as Australian audiences. The project was originally budgeted at £15,000 to be directed by Raymond Longford and starring Frank Harvey. However Australasian wanted an American release, and accordingly hired an American director, Norman Dawn, and imported American stars. Australasian promised Longford work on other films, but soon allowed his contract to lapse. Norman Dawn was in Australia to make a series of scenic shorts and was offered the job by William Gibson of Australasian. The budget was raised to £40,000. During pre-production, questions were asked in the Commonwealth Parliament whether the film should be exported because it depicted Australia's convict past. Hollywood was making an increading number of films on location around this time such as Chang, The Trail of '98 and The Covered Wagon and For the Term of His Natural Life was grouped with these.\\"AUSTRALIA IS STORY SETTING: \\"For the Term of His Natural Life\\" Filmed George Fisher Completes Tale of Convict Life Antipodes Offer Numerous Thrilling Experiences AUSTRALIA IS EPIC SETTING\\" Kingsley, Grace. Los Angeles Times, 26 June 1927, pg. C-13. Differences from novel * The end was changed to a slightly more optimistic one. In the book, Dawes and Sylvia are already dead the next morning. * In the book, Maurice Frere is Richard Devine's cousin. * In the movie, North gives Dawes his coat and tells him to see Sylvia. In the book, he simply drops his coat and hat in Dawes' cell, who manages to escape because the guard is drunk. * Frere is not killed in the book. * \\"The Crow\\" is James \\"Jemmy\\" (not Jeremy) Vetch's nickname. In the movie, they are two different persons. * Sylvia is still a child (eleven years old) at the time of the mutiny, whereas in the movie, she is already a young lady. * In the book, Peter \\"Cranky\\" Brown is a twelve-year-old child, who suicides himself. The person named Cranky Brown in the movie is called Kirkland in the book. * John Rex's death after a stroke is left out in the book. Casting Gibson claimed he tested Australian actors to play the leads but was unable to find people of sufficient quality. Accordingly, four main roles were given to Americans, Eva Novak, George Fisher, Steve Murphy and Katherine Dawn, who arrived in Australia in August 1926. The cast also included: *Arthur McLaglen, a boxer and vaudeville performer who was touring Australia; brother of Victor McLaglen *Marion Marcus Clarke, daughter of Marcus Clarke *Jessica Harcourt, female model *Dunstan Webb, actor and director for Australasian Films Shooting Filming began on 10 August 1926. Great attempts were made to ensure the authenticity of sets and costumes with period costumes being borrowed from Hobart museum and duplicated. After some studio scenes shot at Australasian's Bondi studio, the unit shifted to Port Arthur. Dawn had originally planned to film the Hells Gates and Grummet Island scenes at their original locations in Macquarie Harbour, but his plans changed during the shoot. According to the Hobart Mercury, \\"he said the cliffs at the Gate, and the general appearance, were not such as he had visualised for his picture...In regard to the scene where Rufus Dawes is chained to Grummett Rock, this could be got close to his base of operations.\\" Instead, several establishing shots were taken of Macquarie Harbour and the town of Strahan. In October, the unit returned to Sydney to film prison interiors at the studio. An old sailing ship, the Inca, had been reconditioned and was used for scenes in Sydney Harbour. The prison escape scene was shot on the banks of the Parramatta River near Ryde at a cost of £1,200 for one day's shooting. Other scenes were shot at the convict-built gaol at Berrima and Wombeyan Caves. Throughout production, a trio of musicians played mood music on the set to help the cast with their performances. The budget eventually blew out to a reported £60,000. Some have even claimed it went as high as £70,000Australasian Gazette – 70,000 Pounds Production Nears Completion, Australian Screen Online; accessed 5 December 2015. although Stuart F. Doyle of Australasian put the official figure at £50,000. Release The movie was an enormous success at the Australian box office but did poorly overseas, in part due to the emergence of talking films in 1928. US release The presence of American stars and directors meant the film was publicized in the US but was not released there until 1929. It was estimated the combined losses of this film and Norman Dawn's follow-up, The Adorable Outcast (1928), came to £30,000.Shirley and Adams, p. 93 Cinesound Productions announced plans to remake it with sound in 1932 but this never seems have been seriously pursued. Restoration The movie was restored by Graham Shirley and screened at the 1981 Sydney Film Festival.Graham Shirley, 'Restoring 'For the Term of His Natural Life' ', National Film and Sound Archive, nfsa.gov.au; accessed 4 August 2012. It was based primarily on an incomplete Australian release, comprising less than half of the original film; an American release, provided by the American Film Institute, consisting \\"almost entirely of variant takes and out-takes\\" which were usually of lesser quality; images reused in the 1933 Cinesound Productions travelogue Ghosts of Port Arthur; outtakes and stills from the National Film and Sound Archive; and new intertitles for the remaining gaps.

It is registered (recognized) by Health Level Seven (HL7), and is congruent with the reference terminology model for the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).The Omaha System has the ability to code the majority of the problems and interventions from the hospital record.  Origin  The Omaha System originated at the Visiting Nurse Association of Omaha (located in Nebraska) as a collaborative effort between researchers and interprofessional practitioners. Practitioners developed the Omaha System as part of four federally funded research projects conducted between 1975 and 1993.The Omaha System was constantly refined in its structure and terms during this period to establish reliability, validity, and usability.  Users  Users include nurses, physicians, occupational therapists, physical therapists, registered dietitians, recreational therapists, speech and language pathologists, and social workers. When multidisciplinary health teams use the Omaha System accurately and consistently, they have an effective basis for documentation, communication, coordination of care, and outcome measurement. Use in nursing The American Nurses Association recognized the Omaha System as a standardized terminology to support nursing practice in 1992. In 2014, Minnesota became the first state to recommend that point-of-care terminologies recognized by the American Nurses Association be used in all electronic health records. The evidence underlying this decision was a survey that showed that the Omaha System was used in 96.5% of Minnesota counties. The Omaha System became a member of the Alliance for Nursing Informatics in 2009. It is a reliable nursing documentation tool for outcome and quality of care measurement for clients with mental illness. The Omaha System is also a tool that can be used as a strategy to introduce and incorporate evidence-based practice in the undergraduate nursing clinical experience. Tools that can be utilized in the Omaha System include a comprehensive list of client health problems, nursing interventions, and an outcome rating scale assessing client knowledge, behavior, and health status to standardize nursing care and client outcomes.

Within that claims-based identity framework, a secure token service is responsible for issuing, validating, renewing and cancelling security tokens. The tokens issued by security token services can then be used to identify the holder of the token to services that adhere to the WS-Trust standard. Security token service provides the same functionality as OpenID, but unlike OpenID is not patent encumbered. Together with the rest of the WS-Trust standard, the security token service specification was initially developed by employees of IBM, Microsoft, Nortel and VeriSign. In a typical usage scenario involving a web service that employs WS-Trust, when a client requests access to an application, the application does not authenticate the client directly (for instance, by validating the client's login credentials against an internal database). Instead, the application redirects the client to a security token service, which in turn authenticates the client and grants it a security token. The token consists of a set of XML data records that include multiple elements regarding the identity and group membership of the client, as well as information regarding the lifetime of the token and the issuer of the token. The token is protected from manipulation with strong cryptography. The client then presents the token to an application to gain access to the resources provided by the application. This process is illustrated in the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) use case, demonstrating how single sign-on can be used to access web services. Software that provides security token services is available from numerous vendors, including the open-source Apache CXF, as well as closed-source solutions from Oracle (for interfacing with authentication services backed by an Oracle Database) and Microsoft (where STS is a core component of Windows Identity Foundation and Active Directory Federation Services). While security token services are themselves typically offered as web services used in conjunction with other web services, software development kits (SDKs) for native applications (such as cloud-storage clients) also exist.

It connects the Lower Inn Valley railway with the Brenner railway, bypassing Innsbruck. It was opened on 29 May 1994. The line is at a major part of the rail freight network of Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB). The bypass is part of the Line 1 of Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T). It was intended to increase the capacity of the line and to reduce the noise created by freight trains on the city of Innsbruck. It cost an estimated €211 million to build. The Deutsche Reichsbahn (German Imperial Railways) built a local bypass of Innsbruck station during World War II in 1944, which was demolished in 1945. Major components of the Bypass Innsbruck are: *the grade-separated Fritzens-Wattens 2 junction, *the 488 metre-long bridge over the Inn, *the 12,696 metre-long Inntal (Inn valley) tunnel *the Innsbruck 1 junction Route Junction structure at Fritzens-Wattens 2 The Fritzens-Wattens 2 junction is located at the 60.980 km mark on the Kufstein–Innsbruck line (Lower Inn Valley line) near Volders-Baumkirchen station. The junction is a grade-separated structure that allows trains to run on and off without crossing on-coming trains on the level. The two bypass tracks run between the tracks to and from Innsbruck where they separate. The turnouts have radii of 1,200 m, allowing trains to operate at full speed. When the New Lower Inn Valley line is opened it will connect to the inner pair of tracks, allowing trains to run between the new line and bypass without any change. The bypass will in effect become part of the new line. Inn bridge from the north portal of the Inntal tunnel Inn bridge The Inn bridge is a 488 m long prestressed concrete structure. It crosses the Inn and the Inntal Autobahn A12 and leads directly to the north portal of the Inntal tunnel. In order to strengthen the structure, the side walls rise to 2.2 metres above the level of the track. The interior of the walls are equipped with material that absorbs traffic noise. The construction of the bridge was time-consuming in order to maintain the minimum clearance of 4.20 m above the Inntal Autobahn, requiring a 52 m-long 2,800 ton concrete box bridge. Control room and tunnel rescue site at the south entrance of Inntal tunnel Inntal tunnel The Inntal tunnel is a two line tunnel between Inn Valley and the Wipp valley. With a length of 12.696 kilometers, it is currently the longest railway tunnel in Austria. It cost approximately €120 million to build. Construction of the Inn valley tunnel started in September 1989, with tunnelling from both ends. On 12 December 1992 in the tunnel was broken through and the tunnel was completed in July 1993. After the track-laying, the wiring of the overhead electrical line and the installation of signalling in the tunnel, operations started on 29 May 1994. The tunnel was built using the New Austrian Tunnelling method. In contrast to other new tunnel, it is not built with slab track but instead is equipped with conventional ballasted track and concrete sleepers. The excavated cross-section where it is not lined is 95 square metres, where lining was planned it was 108 square metres. The distance between the centres of the tracks is 4.70 m, corresponding with that of high-speed lines. A cross- over (Üst Fritzens-Wattens 14) was built about halfway through the tunnel at the 9.966 kilometre mark. Immediately after the crossover, a branch in the tunnel was driven to which the two tracks of the planned Brenner Base Tunnel are to be connected. It was built to enable the easy installation of the turnouts and overhead electrification to connect the lines of the base tunnel and the bypass. Innsbruck 1 junction After a short distance in the open air, the bypass line joins the Brenner railway from Innsbruck at the 79.646 km mark from the German border at Kufstein. The junction is equipped with eight sets of points and designed so that freight trains can run on and off the branch in both directions simultaneously without slowing down. Operations Although the Inntal tunnel is fully equipped with all the required signalling and rescue facilities for the operation of all types of trains, it is used almost exclusively by freight trains, including rolling highway trains. Passenger trains only run on it in exceptional circumstances. With the exception of Fritzens-Wattens 1 junction, the entire route is controlled from the remote signalling centre at Innsbruck. After completion of the new Innsbruck operations control centre (German: Betriebsfernsteuerzentrale), which is currently under construction, it will control Fritzens-Wattens 1 junction. Since the bypass joins the Brenner Railway, which has slopes of up to 2.9%, virtually all goods trains need a bank engine, attached to the front. When train loads exceed 1,060 tonnes, a third locomotive is also attached to push the train. Due to local opposition to the construction of a facility for attaching and detaching locomotives in Baumkirchen, this operation has to be carried out in Wörgl terminal north or Wörgl station, requiring an additional journey of up to 44 kilometres per trip.

Located in Queen Victoria Square in the city centre, it is a Grade II* listed building. History The hall, which was designed by Hull's City architect Joseph Hirst in the Baroque Revival style, was built between 1903 and 1909. It was not intended to perform an administrative function for Hull's council, as these functions have historically been carried out in the Guildhall. An organ, which was built by the local firm of Forster and Andrews, was installed in time for an opening concert by the composer Edwin Lemare on 30 March 1911. An art gallery was also installed in the building but this was removed to form the Ferens Art Gallery in Queen Victoria Square in 1927. The space created by the removal of the art gallery was instead used to accommodate an archaeological collection amassed by John Robert Mortimer known as the Mortimer Collection and the area re-opened as the Mortimer Museum in 1931. The hall was damaged in bombing in May 1941 during the Hull Blitz of the Second World War and the organ was badly damaged. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited the city to see the damage and attended a concert in the hall in August 1941. The building was restored and the organ comprehensively restored in 1951 following the war damage. The Mortimer Collection was transferred to the Transport and Archaeology Museum on High Street in 1956. The hall hosted a performance by the rock band Siouxsie and the Banshees in October 1979, by the rock band The Damned in December 1979 and by the rock band Slade in December 1981. City Hall was altered in 1986 and again in 1989. Services City Hall is home to a grand central hall which plays host to a varied programme of concerts including pop, rock and classical music as well as civic functions such as graduation ceremonies for the University of Hull. The city's main tourist Information office and shop is based on the building's ground floor. The main hall has a floor, balcony and gallery with total capacity for 1,200 people seated, or up to 1,800 with a mixture of standing on the main floor and seated on the balcony and gallery.

California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), was a United States Supreme Court case in which a court-appointed attorney filed a motion to withdraw from the appeal of a criminal case because of his belief that any grounds for appeal were frivolous. The Supreme Court ruled that any such motion must be accompanied by a brief (commonly referred to as an Anders brief) outlining the case and any potential (albeit possibly frivolous) grounds for appeal, that the appellate court must independently review the case, and that a defendant must be allowed the right to appeal either pro se or by other counsel.  Background  The specific case involved a California defendant, Charlie Anders, who was convicted of felony possession of marijuana. Anders then requested that the California District Court of Appeal appoint appellate counsel for him, which was granted. Anders' counsel, after review of the case and discussion with Anders, determined that no non-frivolous grounds for appeal existed, and notified the court by letter that counsel would not file an appeal, and that Anders wanted to file an appeal on his own behalf. The entire notification consisted of a single letter from Anders' counsel to the court stating that there was no merit to the appeal. Anders then requested that another attorney be appointed. That request was denied, whereupon Anders filed a pro se appeal which was not successful. Six years later, Anders requested that his case be re-opened on the basis that he was denied the right to counsel. Both the California District Court of Appeal and the California Supreme Court ruled against Anders, whereupon Anders appealed to the Supreme Court which granted certiorari. The U.S. Supreme Court held in the specific case that Anders was denied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, as the bare assertion of lack of grounds for appeal by his counsel was not enough to constitute adequate representation. The Court ruled, however, that an attorney could still move to withdraw on the basis that no non-frivolous grounds for appeal exist, but that certain steps had to be taken before such a motion could be granted. Anders brief In order to file an Anders brief (also called a \\"no-merits brief\\"), the attorney must do the following: # The attorney must file a motion to withdraw as the defendant's counsel. # The motion to withdraw must \\"be accompanied by a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\\" Any and all grounds, even if counsel considers them frivolous, must be raised in the brief. Those grounds include areas such as whether or not a plea of guilty was made voluntarily and freely, or whether the sentence imposed by the court was within the permissible range. # The defendant should be given a copy of the brief and given time to raise any grounds (either pro se or by other counsel) that the defendant so chooses to raise. # The court must then independently \\"after a full examination of all the proceedings\\" decide if the appeal is wholly frivolous. If the court decides it is, then it is to grant counsel's motion to withdraw and then (depending on state law) either dismiss the appeal or rule on its merits, but must still allow the defendant to further appeal if desired. If the court, though, finds that there is at least one non-frivolous ground, it must then allow the defendant the right to make the case and appoint counsel if needed. (As part of an Anders brief, an attorney may request that, if the court finds a non-frivolous ground(s) for appeal, the attorney be allowed to withdraw the brief and remain as counsel, whereupon the attorney would then amend the appeal to argue on the ground(s) that the court has found.) Practical effect The decision of whether or not to file an Anders brief is sometimes difficult for lawyers seeking to respect the ethical rules on frivolity while being zealous advocates for their clients. The Oregon Court of Appeals noted an anomaly with the Anders decision: if counsel raises no grounds for appeal, then the court must review the entire record to determine if a ground for appeal may exist, but if counsel raises any ground (even only one), then the court is required to review only that portion of the record pertaining to the ground raised by counsel and is not required to review any portion related to other grounds not raised. Anders in the Fifty States, Florida State University Law Review, 1996. There is the possibility that an attorney may not see the merit in the error assigned by his or her client, and a client may have viable grounds for the client's claim. In State v. Williams, the Ohio Court of Appeals granted an attorney leave to withdraw, but found a potentially meritorious error and designated a different attorney to represent the defendant, noting pointedly that “an Anders brief is not a substitute for an appellate brief argued on the merits.”2009-Ohio-3199 (Ct. App. Ohio, 6th Dist., Fulton County 2009). There have been incidents where cases have been pressed through the courts after the attorney was granted withdrawal based on an Anders brief, and the defendant has gone on to prevail. The Court of Appeals of Ohio reversed a conviction in State v. Wilkinson,178 Ohio App. 3d 99, 2008-Ohio-4400 (Ct. App. Ohio, 2d Dist., Montgomery County 2008).http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/2/2008/2008-Ohio-4400.pdf and in State v. Kerby2007-Ohio-187 (Ct. App. Ohio 2d Cir. 2007). the court determined that there was a potential issue as to the voluntariness of the confession, appointed new counsel to argue it, and ultimately threw out the defendant's conviction. States abandoning Anders According to an article in the Florida State University Law Review, some states have abandoned the Anders procedure for other means to review appellate cases where the attorney claims no non-frivolous grounds. For example, Idaho does not permit the attorney to withdraw from the case. The attorney, though, can still file an Anders brief (in terms of arguing that there are no non-frivolous grounds for appeal), but the courts do not then independently review the record for error, the argument being that Anders does not trigger the court to do so unless the attorney moves to withdraw, which Idaho has chosen not to permit. New Hampshire also does not permit withdrawal, but specifically exempts a potentially frivolous appeal from being subject to attorney sanctions. North Dakota has taken a different approach: it allows an attorney to withdraw but then assigns a different attorney to the case so the defendant has counsel if desired. California no longer requires the attorney to withdraw. Now she or he may submit a \\"Wende Brief\\",Wende Brief named after the case in which the procedure was approved. States expanding Anders Though Anders itself applies only to criminal proceedings, at least one state has expanded its holding to include other types of cases. The Arkansas Supreme Court has applied Anders by case law to family law cases involving termination of parental rightsLinker-Flores v. Arkansas Dep't of Human Servs. , 359 Ark. 131, 194 S.W.3d 739 (2004). and to adult protective custody cases,Adams v. Arkansas Dep't of Health & Human Servs. , 375 Ark. 402, 291 S.W.3d 172 (2009). and by its own rules to juvenile delinquency and involuntary commitment cases.Rules of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals of the State of Arkansas, Rules 4-3(k) (juvenile delinquency) & 4-8 (involuntary commitment).

The first member of the gens to obtain the consulship was Lucius Ceionius Commodus in AD 78. The rise of this family culminated in the elevation of the emperor Lucius Verus, born Lucius Ceionius Commodus, in AD 161.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, pp. 653 (\\"Ceionius\\"), 816–820 (\\"Commodus\\"). Origin The Ceionii were probably of Etruscan origin. Their nomen resembles other Etruscan names, such as Cilnius, and the family does not appear in history before the first century. The historian Aelius Spartianus wrote that they came from Etruria, or perhaps from the town of Faventia, which was itself of Etruscan origin.Aelius Spartianus, \\"The Life of Aelius Verus\\", 2. Praenomina The praenomina used by the Ceionii were Lucius, Gaius, and Marcus. Branches and cognomina The most illustrious family of the Ceionii bore the cognomen Commodus, meaning \\"friendly, obliging,\\" or \\"pleasant.\\" The agnomen Verus, meaning \\"true\\", was borne by some members of this family. Many other surnames occur, some of which were ordinary cognomina, such as Rufus, meaning \\"red\\" or \\"reddish,\\" or Bassus, \\"stout\\".Chase, p. 110.Cassell's Latin & English Dictionary. However, as with many families of imperial times, many surnames were acquired from other families to whom the Ceionii were related or otherwise politically connected. Postumus, a surname belonging to the father of the emperor Albinus, is derived from the praenomen Postumus, referring to a youngest child, although a popular false etymology derived it from post humus, \\"after burial\\", meaning a child born after his father's death.Chase, pp. 111, 150. In a letter referred to by the historian Julius Capitolinus, Ceionius Postumus claimed to be a descendant of the ancient patrician house of the Postumii, whose nomen was itself derived from the praenomen Postumus.Chase, p. 131. Ceionius named his son Albinus, supposedly in reference both to the extraordinary whiteness of his skin, and to the noble family of the Postumii Albini; however, several other members of the gens also bore the surname Albinus.Julius Capitolinus, \\"The Life of Clodius Albinus\\", 4.

Over the years, it has been the administrative headquarters for five ranger districts. It is located in the small unincorporated community of Tiller, Oregon, United States. The historic structures were built in the rustic style by the Civilian Conservation Corps between 1935 and 1942. Today, the ranger station is the headquarters for the Tiller Ranger District, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  In the early 20th century, the forest road networks were not well developed. To facilitate work in National Forests, the Forest Service built district ranger stations at strategic locations within the forest to house full-time employees and provide logistics support to fire patrols and project crews working in remote areas of the forest. After World War II, the Forest Service greatly expanded its road network, allowing employees to get to most forest areas within a few hours. As a result, many of the more isolated ranger stations were closed or converted to summer guard stations. However, the Tiller Ranger Station has continuously served as a district headquarters since it was established.\\"A Bit of History\\", Recreation Rentals of the Pacific Northwest, Pacific Northwest Region, United States Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Portland, Oregon, 8 February 2010.\\"Ranger Districts and District Ranger 1916-2008\\", Umpqua National Forest, United States Forest Service, Department of Agriculture, Roseburg, Oregon, 3 September 2008. Over the years, five ranger districts have used the Tiller Ranger Station as their administrative headquarters. In 1908, the Umpqua National Forest was created in southern Oregon.\\"Tiller Ranger Station\\", National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, National Park Service, United States Department of Interior, Washington, D.C., 9 October 1987. The Summit Ranger District was established in 1913 as an administrative subdivision of the Umpqua National Forest. However, the district was not staffed with a ranger until 1918. The Summit district was responsible for the south bank of the South Umpqua River extending east to the Rogue-Umpqua divide in the Rattlesnake Mountain area. The Deadman Ranger District was also created in 1913 and staffed in 1918. It covered the north side of the South Umpqua River drainage. Both districts had their administrative headquarters at the Tiller Ranger Station. The South Umpqua Ranger District was established in 1916. Its district headquarters was also located at Tiller Ranger Station. In 1920, the Summit and Deadman ranger districts were merged into the South Umpqua district. Community picnic at Tiller Ranger Station, 1928In 1935, the Civilian Conservation Corps began doing construction work at the ranger station. Between 1935 and 1942, Civilian Conservation Corps crews built a number of ranger station buildings. The Civilian Conservation Corps personnel worked under the supervision of Forest Service rangers. All of the buildings constructed during that period were designed by the Forest Service's Pacific Northwest Regional Architecture Group, and were built in the Cascadian rustic style. The Cow Creek Ranger District was created in 1946 from a division of the large South Umpqua Ranger District. Two years later, the two ranger districts were recombined into a single South Umpqua district. In 1954, the South Umpqua district was again divided into a new Cow Creek district and a smaller South Umpqua district; however, the two districts had different boundaries than the earlier division. The South Umpqua district retained authority over the upper South Umpqua River drainage while the Cow Creek district administered the Cow Creek, Elk Creek, and Beaver Creek watersheds. Both districts maintained district offices at Tiller Ranger Station. In 1956, the Cow Creek Ranger District was reduced in size when a large portion of the Oregon and California Railroad lands were administratively transferred to the Bureau of Land Management. The Cow Creek district was renamed the Tiller Ranger District in 1964. In 1968, the South Umpqua Ranger District was consolidated with the Tiller Ranger District. The new district kept the Tiller name because the administrative headquarters was still located at the Tiller Ranger Station. Today, the Tiller Ranger District covers on the western slopes of the Cascade Mountains in southern Oregon.\\"History\\", Umpqua National Forest, United States Forest Service, Department of Agriculture, Roseburg, Oregon, 5 August 2008. The Tiller Ranger Station still serves as the administrative headquarters for the district. 27 buildings make up the ranger station complex, nine of which are historically important. All the historic buildings except the barn are located in close proximity to one another, with the non-historic structures on the periphery of the compound. The historic buildings are all in excellent condition and are still used by Forest Service employees. Because the Tiller Ranger Station is of unique historic value as an early Forest Service ranger station, the compound was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 6 March 1991.

Structures  Forest Service open pine tree logo designWith nine historic buildings, the Tiller Ranger Station is a classic Forest Service ranger station. All of the historic buildings were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps between 1935 and 1942. Their work included four ranger residences, an equipment warehouse, a vehicle repair shop, a barn (now used for storage), and two garages. The buildings were constructed in the Cascadian rustic architectural style using weatherboard, wood shingles, native lava stone, and concrete as the principal building materials. Many of the gables and shutters have the open pine tree logo common to Forest Service structures built during the 1930s.\\"Tiller Ranger Station\\", Archiplanet, www.archiplanet.org, 5 December 2006. The four ranger residences are all of unique design. All of the residences were built in the late 1930s. The largest (Residence #1058) was built in 1936. It is a T-shaped, one-and-one-half-story wood-frame building on a concrete foundation. It has a high gabled roof with intersecting cross-gabled hip extensions above the main entry. Three stone steps lead to a flagstone porch in front of the main entrance. The front porch is supported by square posts. There is a stone masonry chimney on the east side of the building. The building's exterior is covered with wood shingles except the gable ends and gablets which have vertical board siding. Like the other three residences, the building has six-over-six double-hung sash windows flanked by decorative shutters with pine tree logo cut-outs. Adjacent to the residence is a hip roof garage with the shingle siding. There is a pine tree cut-out on the main vehicle entry door. The other three residences are all one-story structures. One is a T-shaped design while the remaining two have rectangular footprints. All three are wood-frame structures on concrete foundations. They all have shingles exteriors, flagstone porches, stone masonry chimneys, and gabled roofs. However, each has a different floor plan and exterior look. There is a second garage located next to the T-shaped residence.

The warehouse is a one-and-one-half-story rectangular building with a large drive- in storage area at one end and an interior storage area at the other end. It is a wood-frame structure with horizontal wood siding. The automotive shop is also a one-and-one-half-story rectangular building. It is a wood-frame structure on a concrete foundation with vertical board siding. The shop has three large vehicle bays with pull-down doors and an adjoining storage and work area. Barn built by the Civilian Conservation CorpsThe barn is a two- story rectangular structure built in 1940. It is a wood-frame building on a concrete foundation with a gambrel roof. The barn has a wood shingle exterior with simple four-panel wood-casement windows. There are two ground-floor entry doors on the south gable end of the building. There is also a hayloft entry on the second floor above the ground-floor entrances. The loft entrance is covered with large side-hung double-doors. On the east side of the building, there is another doorway near the center of the structure along with two large drive-in entry doors for loading and unloading. There is a large shed attached to the north end of the barn. The shed-annex has a drive-in entrance on the east side of the building next to the barn's two drive-in loading doors. The Forest Service now uses the barn for general-purpose storage.  Location  The Tiller Ranger Station is in southeastern Douglas County, Oregon surrounded by the Umpqua National Forest. The elevation at the site is above sea level. The forest around the ranger station is made up of Douglas fir, hemlock, and Western red cedar. The Tiller Ranger Station is east of Canyonville, Oregon in the small unincorporated community of Tiller, Oregon. The ranger station is on the south bank of the South Umpqua River, just off Oregon Route 227. The Forest Service district office and all of the historic buildings are on the north side of the highway.Tiller, Oregon topographic map, United States Geological Survey, United States Department of Interior, Reston, Virginia; displayed via ACME mapper, www.acme.com, 8 February 2010.

The spacecraft was launched on 20 May 2010, aboard an H-IIA rocket, together with the Akatsuki (Venus Climate Orbiter) probe and four other small spacecraft. IKAROS is the first spacecraft to successfully demonstrate solar sail technology in interplanetary space. On 8 December 2010, IKAROS passed by Venus at about distance, completing the planned mission successfully, and entered its extended operation phase. Purpose The IKAROS probe is the world's first spacecraft to use solar sailing as the main propulsion. It was designed to demonstrate four key technologies (comments in parentheses refer to figure): # Deployment and control of a large, thin solar sail membrane (grey- blue areas numbered 3) # Thin-film solar cells integrated into the sail to power the payload (black rectangles numbered 4) # Measurement of acceleration due to radiation pressure on the solar sail # Attitude control by varying the reflectance of 80 liquid crystal panels embedded in the sail (orange rectangles numbered 2) The mission also includes investigations of aspects of interplanetary space, such as gamma-ray bursts, solar wind and cosmic dust. The probe's ALADDIN instrument (ALDN-S and ALDN-E) measured the variation in dust density while its Gamma-Ray Burst Polarimeter (GAP) measured the polarization of gamma-ray bursts during its six-month cruise. IKAROS is to be followed by a 40 × 40 m sail, the Jupiter Trojan Asteroid Explorer, intended to journey to Jupiter and the Trojan asteroids, launched in the late 2020s, with a proposed goal of returning an asteroid sample to Earth in the 2050s.

Kawaguchi. 49th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 2018 (LPI Contrib. No. 2083). Design IKAROS sail schematic diagram: IKAROS spaceprobe in flight (artist's depiction) The square sail, deployed via a spinning motion using tip masses (key item 1 in figure at right), is on the diagonal and is made of a thick sheet of polyimide (key item 3 in figure at right). The polyimide sheet had a mass of about 10 grams per square metre, resulting in a total sail mass of 2 kilograms, excluding tip masses, attached panels and tethers. A thin-film solar array is embedded in the sail (key item 4 in figure at right). PowerFilm, Inc. provided the thin-film solar array. Eighty blocks of LCD panels are embedded in the sail, whose reflectance can be adjusted for attitude control (key item 2 in figure at right). The sail also contains eight dust counters on the opposite face as part of the science payload. Mission progress IKAROS was successfully launched together with Akatsuki (the Venus Climate Orbiter) aboard an H-IIA rocket from the Tanegashima Space Center on 21 May 2010. IKAROS spun at 20–25 revolutions per minute and finished unfurling its sail on 10 June 2010. The craft contains two tiny ejectable cameras, DCAM1 and DCAM2. DCAM2 was used to photograph the sail after deployment on 14 July 2010. Acceleration and attitude control (orientation) were successfully tested during the remaining six-month voyage to Venus. On 9 July 2010, JAXA confirmed that IKAROS is being accelerated by its solar sail, and on 23 July announced successful attitude control. Over a 23-hour period of time, the solar angle of the sail was changed by a half a degree, not by using thrusters, but by dynamically controlling the reflectivity of the 80 liquid crystal panels at the outer edge of the sail so that the sunlight pressure would produce torque. IKAROS continues to spin at approximately 2 rpm, requiring the LCD panels to be cycled at that rate for attitude control. According to JAXA, IKAROS finished all planned experiments in Dec 2010, but the mission has continued beyond that date \\"in order to enhance the skill of controlling solar sail\\". On 30 November 2012, JAXA announced that IKAROS had been recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's first solar sail spacecraft between planets, and that its two separated cameras, DCAM1 and DCAM2, had been recognized as the smallest size of a spacecraft flying between planets. As of 2012, the IKAROS continued to spin, but its attitude control had degraded. This resulted in unexpected sail motions and as a result, downlink through the medium-gain antenna was only intermittently available. The project team was dissolved on 28 March 2013, although a trial receipt of data was planned for a later date. The project was reactivated on 20 June 2013 in the expectation that the satellite would wake up from a hibernation state as more power from the solar panels became available. The team was able to receive telemetry from the IKAROS between 20 June and 12 September 2013, after which contact was again lost. The loss of contact was around the predicted time of the spacecraft again entering a low-power hibernation mode as power from the solar panels decreased. Available communication time through the Usuda Deep Space Center antenna was limited, so data was gathered only intermittently to estimate the speed, trajectory and rotation of the satellite. As of August 2013, acceleration from the IKAROS sail had changed the craft's speed by approximately in total. Transmissions were again received on 22 May 2014, the spacecraft flying at a distance of about 230 million kilometers from the Earth. By May 2014, IKAROS was on a ten-month orbit around the Sun, spending seven months of each orbit in hibernation mode due to insufficient power. By 23 April 2015, the spacecraft woke up from hibernation mode for the 4th time and was flying at a distance of about 120 million kilometers from the Earth. On 21 May 2015, JAXA could not receive a signal from IKAROS and concluded that the spacecraft had shifted to the hibernation mode for the fifth time, as expected. Based on May 2015 data the position of IKAROS at the time was about 110 million kilometers away from the Earth, and about 130 million kilometers from the Sun. Scientific results From the gamma-ray polarization data of GAP, Toma et al. puts a stricter limit on CPT violation. It is an improvement of eight orders of magnitude over previous limits. JAXA scientists stated that the measured thrust force by the solar radiation pressure on IKAROS' 196 m2 sail is 1.12 millinewtons.

After leaving school in 1976, she worked at gigs and a variety of jobs including waitress at Panton Hill Hotel and running a clothing and gift shop in Northcote. In 1977, she began to be given lead vocal parts while working with \\"Overproof & The Distiller Sisters\\". In 1978, she joined with some former members of the Eltham band, \\"Reuben Tice\\" to form \\"The Sharin Anderson Band\\" and began performing at Melbourne venues such as \\"Marijuhana House\\", \\"Christmas Hills Festival\\", and \\"Movement Against Uranium Mining\\" benefit concerts. From 1982 to 1986, Sharin performed with the Sharin Anderson Band as well as solo gigs and work with a range of Melbourne bands including \\"The Perfect Hosts\\" (backing vocals), \\"The Robbie Greig Band\\" (backing vocals), \\"The Connection\\" (lead & backing vocals), \\"Bluey\\" (main vocals), \\"The Motown Jackets\\" (main vocals). In 1986, Sharin formed \\"Hey Gringo\\" and performed originals and covers at venues such as The Cricketers Arms, Panton Hill Hotel and St Andrews Hotel. In 1988, Sharin modelled for the painter Clifton Pugh whom she had met through her work at the Panton Hill Hotel where he was a regular patron. In gratitude, Shane Pugh (Clifton's son) gave her one of the limited edition colour etchings of the work in which she appeared – \\"Leda and the Swan 1\\" (1989). Sharin also modelled several times during 1988–1989 for Rick Amor and Prue Acton at Pugh's property, Dunmoochin. In 1989, Sharin won a singer/ songwriting competition run by Creative Synergies which provided 250 hours of studio recording time at Silkwood Studios (formerly York Street Studios) in Nth Fitzroy. She recorded 12 original songs including \\"Do They Say To You\\", \\"That's Enough For Me\\" and \\"Let's Not Fool\\". During 1990–1993, Sharin also found musical work as a session vocalist for advertising jingles with Silkwood Studios and also occasionally with Burkhard Dallwitz. In 1990, Sharin recorded a version of her song titled \\"Buried Alive\\" at Peter Mumme's Studio in Christmas Hills (with Peter playing keyboards/synthesiser). Sharin got to the finals in the \\"Best Unsigned Band Competition\\" of 1992 run by The Musician Magazine (The finals judges were Chrissie Hynde, Sun Ra, Don Was, Bootsy Collins and John Hiatt). From 1993 to 1996, Sharin performed at Melbourne venues and festivals with a band line-up called \\"Sharin Anderson and The Blue Angels\\". In 1994, she reached the finals in the \\"Blues Performer of the Year\\". In 1996, she sang backing vocals on Debbie Morrow's CD \\"Violence in Animation\\" In 1996, Sharin needed a more certain income stream and qualified and commenced work as a support worker for people with intellectual disabilities. In the mid-1990s, Sharin started drawing with coloured pen and ink and created hundreds of abstract patterned [mandala|mandalas] as well as square and rectangular geometric designs. She also began to create drawings based on the surrounding urban landscapes in the inner northern suburbs of Melbourne. In 1998, Sharin formed \\"Lola's Delight\\" with Nadine Budge and Marni Sheehan and performed around Melbourne in venues such as The Lomond Hotel, The Brunswick Music Festival,The Brunswick Music festival Ruckers (now Wesley Annes of NorthcoteWesley Annes of Northcote), The Maldon Folk FestivalMaldon Folk Festival and the Eltham Festival. In 2002, Sharin occasionally contributed backing vocals and guitar with \\"The Urban Nomads\\" and on their recording of \\"Long Way From Water\\".

Built in 1917, Horserød was originally a prison camp, and in local parlance the site is still referred to as Horserødlejren (The Horserød Camp).  History  Russian prisoners of war at Horserød camp The camp originally consisted of approximately 75 wooden barracks and was built in 1917 to confine Russian prisoners of war who were transferred from Germany and the Eastern front during the First World War. After the war, the camp then housed various kinds of refugees, and at one point was converted to a summer camp for school children from the slums of Copenhagen. World War II Between 19 April 1940 and 2 August 1941, 80 German immigrants were detained in groups in Horserød camp before being sent back to Germany. A court in Hamburg later sentenced 14 of them to capital punishment, while the rest were interned in Nazi concentration camps. In Denmark, communists had long been surveilled and perceived as a threat to national security by the political establishment and on 22 June 1941, around 300 Danish members of the Communist Party of Denmark (DKP) were arrested by the Danish police. In Copenhagen they were detained at Vestre Prison without charge and on the 20 August, 107 of the arrested men were deported from Vestre Prison to the Horserød camp, among them member of parliament Martin Nielsen. On 22 August 1941, the Danish parliament adopted the Anti-Communist Act with retroactive effect. On 29 August 1943, during the countrywide Operation Safari, the Germans captured the camp and in the event, 95 prisoners managed to escape, while the remaining 150 communists were subsequently deported to the German Stutthof concentration camp. From around September that year, the German Gestapo began using Horserød to detain various Danish resistance members and Jews. Although Horserød camp was not officially described as a concentration camp, it had the same functions, but unlike the German concentration camps, it was not administered by the SS. About 6,000 Jews successfully fled by boat from Denmark to Sweden in October 1943, but around 500 did not make it and were captured by the German forces in their attempt. 250 of these were sent to the Horserød camp. On 13 October 1943, 175 imprisoned Jews from Horserød were deported by train to Theresienstadt. On 23 November 1943, another 16 Jews were deported by train to Ravensbrück (women and children) and Sachsenhausen (men), of which 14 were later transferred to Theresienstadt. These train deportations of Jews from Denmark to Nazi concentration camps, were two out of a total of four during World War II. All in all, 472 Jews were deported by these four trains. In 1944, when the Danish government created Frøslev Prison Camp, the inmates from Horserød were moved there. From April 1945, the Germans used Horserød camp as a military hospital for wounded German soldiers. Post-war From 15 August 1945 the camp was used for the internment of Danish traitors who had collaborated with Nazi Germany. The last of these was released in 1956. The Danish prison services took over Horserød camp in 1947. The 22 June is now an annual day of remembrance held at a monument at the camp, commemorating the arresting and detention of Danish communists in 1941.  Present times  Horserød Camp has had many notable detainees throughout its long history. As an open prison in modern times, Danish politician Peter Brixtofte served a two-year sentence here from 6. August 2008. He published the book Mit Horserød (My Horserød) in 2009.  Monument and museum  On the 22 June 1991, a monumental sculpture known as Håbets Port (Gate of Hope) commemorating the former communist prisoners was erected at the Horserød camp. The granite sculpture is made by Per Ulrich, with text inscriptions from Hans Kirk. Hans Kirk was among the detained communist prisoners in Horserød, but managed to escape in 1943. Per Ulrich was arrested for resistance activities in 1944 and after a short detention in Horserød he was deported to Frøslevlejren and eventually various prisons in Germany and both the Neuengamme and Sachsenhausen concentration camps, which he survived. Since 2002, there is a small prison museum across the main entrance of the Horserød camp, exhibiting its history. It is known as Horserødlejrens Museum.

Biography  He was born on a large farm in the Kherson Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine). His father was a retired military man who had received a title of nobility, was a member of the Kherson governing committee, supervised the local Zemstvo school and was an honorary magistrate. At the age of seven, he was already making copies of the Dutch engravings that decorated his home. In 1860, he became one of the first students at a new private boy's academy in Yelisavetgrad.A Chronicle of the Life and Art of Ivan Pokhitonov @ the Tretyakov Gallery. He later attended several other schools. Portrait of Eugenia (Ninie) Wulffert In 1868, he entered the Petrovskaya Agricultural Academy in Moscow. At that time, many of the students there held revolutionary opinions and he attended speeches lamenting the plight of small farmers. He became caught up in the complicated events involving the nihilist Sergey Nechayev, but escaped serious punishment. He was, however, expelled and sent home to be supervised by his father and the police. In 1871, he was allowed to enroll at Odessa University, where he took classes in drawing and watercolors in addition to his regular course of study. These classes would be his only formal art instruction. Shortly after, he travelled to Geneva with his mother and sister, where he exhibited his watercolors. They were a success so, after a brief period of employment at the \\"State Bank of Odessa\\", he travelled to Italy, then settled in Paris and found a position working with Eugène Carrière.Brief biography @ RusArtNet. He exhibited regularly at the Salon and several of his paintings were purchased by Pavel Tretyakov. Later, he would sign a lucrative contract with Georges Petit. Marriage In 1881, he received an order from the Russian government to paint a series of panels depicting scenes from the Russo-Turkish War. He travelled to Bulgaria to do sketches for the work, accompanied by Matilda Wulffert (1856-1927), a Swedish- Finnish medical student he had met at the Russian Artists' Club. They were married in Chernivtsi in 1882. She was a very outspoken feminist, and devoted to her career, so their temperaments began to clash. In 1892, he asked for a divorce, but she refused. In response, he began an affair with her younger sister Eugenia. In return, she would not allow him to visit his two daughters until they were adults.Matilda Pokhitonova's Correspondence by Eleanora Paston @ the Tretyakov Gallery. She went on to become a prominent dermatologist and medical researcher. He spent eight months painting in Italy, at a small village outside Naples then, deciding that he could no longer live in Paris, he and Eugenia moved to Liège, Belgium. They continued to travel throughout Western Europe and Russia and, in 1895, he became an honorary member of the Peredvizhniki. In 1901, he acquired an estate in the Minsk Governorate, where he lived and worked until 1906, when he returned to Belgium. He was elected to the Imperial Academy of Arts in 1904. During World War I, he lived in Saint Petersburg until the beginning of the Revolution, then fled to Kuban, where he stayed for a year. Back in Belgium, he initially lived in De Panne, then moved to Brussels. His eyesight had been failing for several years and he painted little after that. In 1922, he had his last exhibition.

The church of Saint Joan of Arc was completed in 1979 in the centre of the ancient market square, known as the Place du Vieux-Marché, the place where Joan of Arc was burned at the stake for heresy in 1431. A small garden, Le Bouchet, which is outside and to the north of the church marks the exact spot. The modern church Sainte-Jeanne d'Arc and the adjacent market halls were designed by the architect Louis Arretche, who was commissioned in 1969. The sweeping curves of the structure are meant to evoke both the flames that consumed Joan of Arc and an overturned longship. Many early Christian churches were designed in the shape of an overturned boat. The market halls simultaneously resemble smaller overturned boats and fish with gaping mouths, which are also rich Christian symbols. The tiled roof echoes this theme and forms a covered walkway over the square.  Stained glass  The stained glass windows come from the 16th century Church of Saint Vincent, whose ruins are located a few metres away. The old church was almost completely destroyed in 1944 during World War II, but the windows had been removed and stored in a safe location during the war. They were then incorporated into the Church of Saint Joan of Arc.

Biography Tattersall was born in Auckland on 29 March 1866.Alfred James Tattersall Museum of New Zealand He moved to Samoa in 1886 to work as an assistant in the studio of John Davis. When Davis died in 1893 Tattersall took over his studio and negative collection. He went on to live in Samoa from 1886 to 1951, including the volatile era when Britain, Germany and the United States were vying for control of the Samoa Islands. Many of his photographs are significant in the history of Samoa and covered eras such as German Samoa (1900 - 1914) followed by the country's administration under New Zealand which saw the rise of the pro-independence Mau movement. Tattersall went to Samoa in 1886 to be an assistant in the photography studio of British photographer, John Davis. This was the era of colonial photography in the South Pacific when the tropical landscapes and indigenous people provided 'continual fascination' for foreign photographers. In 1891, another New Zealander, Thomas Andrew joined Davis and Tattersall. In the same year, Tattersall married Blanche Yandall. In 1903, Tattersall took over the business when Davis died. Postcards were a popular part of his business which distributed the images around the world. Apart from landmark historical events, Tattersall also photographed hundreds of landscape scenery and studio portraits of Samoans posing in traditional attire. In 1920 Tattersall was appointed as one of the three unofficial members of the new Legislative Council of Western Samoa.Lauofo Meti (2002) Samoa: The Making of the Constitution, National University of Samoa, p17 He contested the 1926 elections to the Council, but was unsuccessful.Legislative Council Elections Samoanische Zeitung, 3 December 1926 He died in Western Samoa on 25 November 1951 at the age of 85.Mr. A.J.

It is commonly known as the green fuzzy mushroom, elephant ear mushroom coral, giant anemone, giant mushroom anemone and giant cup mushroom.Animal-World: Green Fuzzy Mushroom This species is toxic when eaten raw and ingestion can cause fatal poisoning.Observations on the Toxic Sea Anemone, Rhodactis howesii (Coelenterata) Description This coral mushroom is essentially a coral without a skeleton and its internal structure is similar to a stony coral. The upper surface is the oral disc. It has a short stalk or column below which is the pedal disc which adheres to the substrate. It can detach itself and drift to another location. It is either green or brown, and five to eight centimetres high. The tentacles are very short and somewhat knobbly, giving the oral disc a fuzzy appearance. They tentacles at the edge of the disc are longer and contain toxins which damage other corals close by but which are harmless to humans. R. howesii is a carnivore and catches plankton and other micro particles that float past its oral disc. It also obtains nutriments from its endosymbiotic algae. Reproduction There are three asexual means of reproduction. Budding can occur when new individuals are formed from pieces that divide off from the pedal disc. Fragmentation can occur when the individual moves slowly over the substrate and leaves small pieces of itself behind which eventually grow into new individuals. Division or fission can also occur when the corallimorph divides down the centre to form two new individuals. Sexual reproduction also sometimes occurs and eggs and sperm are released into the water. They unite and form free-swimming larvae which are initially planktonic. Later they settle and adhere to the substrate, growing into new individuals. Toxicity American Samoans call R. howesii \\"matamalu\\" and are aware that consuming it uncooked can be fatal. Such ingestion has been recorded and may have happened accidentally or may have been used as a means of committing suicide. Cooking seems to destroy the poison and cooked \\"matamalu\\" is commonly eaten by the Samoans. The three patients who had been poisoned by R. howesii and who were observed in a hospital in Samoa, fell into a prolonged stupor which lasted from 8 to 36 hours. During this time the knee jerk reflex and the pupillary light reflex were absent but the blood pressure and pulse rate remained normal. All three developed prolonged shock and later died from pulmonary oedema. The medical history and the course of their illness resembled the paralytic poisoning caused by shellfish. Invasiveness Under some circumstances, R. howesii may become an invasive species. In 1991, a hundred- foot vessel was shipwrecked on Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge. Thirteen years later it was observed that R. howesii had colonised the area around the wreck. Over the next few years, the population increased rapidly close to the vessel and by 2008 had reached high concentrations and a phase shift had occurred in the ecology of the reef. Around the ship, R. howesii covered the sea bed overgrowing and directly competing with the few remaining corals (mainly Montipora sp., Pocillopora sp. and Acropora sp.). Close to the wreck there were as many as 288 individuals per square metre and it extended for up to 1100 metres from the vessel.Phase Shift from a Coral to a Corallimorph-Dominated Reef Associated with a Shipwreck on Palmyra Atoll Quite why R. howesii has flourished so abundantly at this location is not fully understood, but it is possible that iron is leaching from the ship and promoting its growth. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that similar explosive growth in numbers of R. howesii has occurred around the mooring chains of three buoys anchored some distance from the wreck. Iron is an essential trace element for growth of algae and nitrogen fixation,Falkowski P, Barber R, Smetacek V (1998) Biogeochemical controls and feedbacks on ocean primary production. Science 281: 200–206. and much of the Pacific Ocean is extremely low in available iron which is a limiting resource for many marine organisms.Butler A (1998) Acquisition and utilization of transition metal ions by marine organisms.

At the Bodavian Embassy in New York, Silencer abducted Sigjid where he had him write a confession retracting the editorials. Afterwards, Silencer killed him. Barzon later became Silencer again and attacks a Communist rally to throw off suspicion. This led him into conflict with Falcon where Silencer threw a grenade that Falcon had to dispose of which enabled Silencer to get away. During a rally in Sigjid's honor, Barzon hired a thug named Hal Doerner to pose as Silencer so that Barzon can kill him to throw off any suspicions. Falcon followed a clue in Sigjid's confession letter. After figuring it out, Falcon apprehended Barzon and handed him over to the police.Marvel Premiere #49. Marvel Comics. Akyia Badaranaike Akiya Badaranaike lived a peaceful life in Africa, until the alien race known as the Horde declared war on Earth, frequently plundering its resources and periodically slaughtering or enslaving parts of the population. Unfortunately, the Horde also decided to set up its earthbound headquarters in Africa, conquering most of it through war and forming a base in South Africa. Akiya's family was killed throughout this expedition of the Horde. Later, her lover was also killed in a raid of the Horde, leaving her with intense hatred for the aliens and a desire to avenge her loved ones. Later, while in a refugee camp in Gabon, Akiya was tested and found genetically eligible to undergo the elite Morituri process. Akiya decided to volunteer for the program. Her self- described goal was to make the world a better place for lovers by killing as many Hordians as possible.Strikeforce: Morituri #13Strikeforce: Morituri #22 The Morituri process granted superhuman abilities to ordinary humans, to be used as soldiers of Earth in its fight against the Horde. The powers came at a terrible price, however: the recipients were aware they would die within a year of receiving it, owing to a fatal flaw to it that made it unstable. Nevertheless, Akiya enthusiastically underwent the process and emerged with the ability to psychically break down sound waves, thus producing silence. Akiya named herself \\"Silencer\\" and officially debuted as a member of the third generation of Strikeforce: Morituri.Strikeforce: Morituri #13 Months later, the Morituri found out that a team of doctors, authorized by their employers, the Paedia Council, had attempted to produce new Morituri without the supervision of the inventor of the process, Dr. Kimmo Tuolema. Unfortunately, the rushed and careless efforts of the doctors turned the new Morituri into horrible monstrosities. The new Morituri, suffering in their new form, begged the veteran Morituri to release them from their agony and kill them. Silencer respected their wish and euthanized them by stopping their hearts. After they had all died, Silencer screamed with rage and sorrow.Strikeforce: Morituri #17 Sometime later, fellow team member Hardcase confessed to Silencer that he would die a virgin, without ever having felt the love of a woman. Surprised, Silencer offered to introduce him in the joy of love. The two struck a relationship and made love together. Shortly afterwards, the team defended a chocolate factory from being plundered by the Horde. The fight proved unusually easy, and Hardcase decided to exit the factory and hunt down some of the fleeing Hordians, taking Silencer along with him. As they exited hand-in- hand, however, the Hordians from a ship above activated a microwave cannon which incinerated both Hardcase and Silencer, leaving behind their charred skeletons. Silencer and Hardcase were then seen hand-in-hand moving to the afterlife together.Strikeforce: Morituri #23 Dean Helm Crossfire hired Silencer to kill Hawkeye when Hawkeye and Mockingbird found out there were illegal activities taking place at Cross Technological Enterprises. Silencer followed Hawkeye back to his apartment and attempted to kill him in his sleep. Hawkeye awoke before Silencer was able to shoot and, with the help of Mockingbird, foiled the assassin's attempt at his life. Silencer was able to escape by jumping out a window. Later that night, Hawkeye and Mockingbird broke into Cross Technological Enterprises to try to find incriminating evidence, but were interrupted by Silencer. During the fight, both Silencer and Hawkeye fell out of a window and landed on Hawkeye’s skycycle. The two fought on the skycycle until they both fell towards a smokestack. Hawkeye fell into the smokestack, while Silencer fell onto the rim. Believing Hawkeye to be dead, Silencer turned away looking for a way to climb down. It was then that Hawkeye grabbed Silencer’s foot and pulled him into the smokestack and (presumably) falling to his doom.Hawkeye #2 Although the character's name is unrevealed during his first appearance, Silencer's real name is revealed to be Dean Helm in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Hardcover #3.Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Hardvover #3 Mob enforcer The Silencer is an unnamed mob enforcer who joined some gang members into looking for the evidence that linked the crime boss Alphonse Scarpetti to the courthouse killings. They start by tracking down Sam \\"Big Bear\\" Lincoln who used to be a boxer and mob enforcer and now works as a janitor at the Hayden Planetarium. They were unable to get the answers out of Lincoln, so Silencer snapped his neck. They headed to MacKinley Stewart upon figuring out that Lincoln sent the evidence to him. As Elektra was friends with Stewart, she came to his rescue causing Scarpetti to send in Silencer. Elektra was defeated by Silencer as his fellow gangsters looted Stewart's room and found what they are looking for. With help from Spider-Man, Elektra figures out that Scarpetti is behind the attacks. As Spider-Man prevents Elektra from killing Scarpetti, Silencer appears where he attacks Elektra with an axe. Spider-Man leapt towards Silencer and suddenly went through him. When Silencer threw Spider-Man and Elektra out the window, they did events that led to them getting the audiotape. Upon tracing the information the Hayden Planetarium, Spider-Man and Elektra started looking until they ran into Silencer who was posing as a part of the black hole mural. During the fight, Silencer discovered that a meteorite on display had a magnetic pull. Spider- Man then pushed the meteorite into Silencer which absorbed him and started burning. The meteorite was then placed in an airtight cell at Ravencroft.Peter Parker, Spider-Man/Elektra Annual 1998 Unnamed Silencer The fifth Silencer is an inmate at the Big House.

Powers and abilities The Count Barzon version of Silencer wielded a gun that removed the power of speech from whoever it struck. The Akiya Badaranaike version of Silencer has the ability to nullify sound waves. She also has enhanced strength. The Dean Helm version of Silencer has no superhuman abilities. His uniform contains a device which nullifies all sonic energy within his vicinity. Hence, he cannot speak, nor does he make any noise as he moves. He is also equipped with a semi-automatic German Luger pistol, which in turn does not make any noise either. Silencer's uniform is insulated, making him immune to electronic attacks. The mob enforcer version of Silencer has super-strength, teleportation, and a body composed of an unnamed murky substance which left him invulnerable and enabled him to shapeshift. The unnamed Silencer can generate a \\"null sound\\" which nullifies any sound within a certain distance.

Plot In 260 BC, the Qin state inflicts a devastating defeat on the Zhao state at the Battle of Changping. A group of refugees flees from Zhao and settles down in the Lively Valley, an isolated paradise-like world. Two young men, Jing Ke and Fan Wuji, grew up in the valley with their common love interest, Ye Xiaohu. When Fan Wuji learns that his ancestral roots are actually from Qin, he leaves them and returns to his native state, where he becomes a subordinate of the infamous Qin general Bai Qi. On the other hand, Jing Ke and Ye Xiaohu travel to the Qi state and settle there. As Ye Xiaohu is tired of leading a wandering life, she leaves Jing Ke and marries a rich man, who abuses her all the time. Ye Xiaohu plots with the rich man's henchman, Nie Wuya, to kill her husband and seize his fortune, and then frame Jing Ke for the murder. Jing Ke is arrested and almost executed, but is saved by Tian Guang, who recommends him to join an assassin organisation. Later, he becomes an apprentice of a powerful swordsman and inherits his master's legendary skills. However, as he completes more missions, he feels that he is pursuing a life that he does not want, especially after he witnesses the death of his second love interest, Yunxi. At the same time, he strikes up a close friendship with the musician Gao Jianli. Meanwhile, in the Qin state, Fan Wuji wins the favour of Ying Zheng, the King of Qin, for his distinguished service on the battlefield, but unknowingly incurs the jealousy of the chancellor Lü Buwei. Jing Ke's adventures lead him to the Yan state, where he meets Crown Prince Dan, who requests his help in assassinating the ruthless Ying Zheng to save the other states from being conquered by the Qin state. Dan was initially held hostage in Qin, but was released by Fan Wuji. Fan Wuji, who is now denounced as a traitor by Ying Zheng, flees to Yan to join Jing Ke and Crown Prince Dan. Jing Ke accepts the mission. Fan Wuji aids him by committing suicide because Ying Zheng has already placed a high price on Fan's head for treason. Jing Ke embarks on his no-return quest, bringing along with him Fan Wuji's head and a map of Dukang with a dagger concealed inside. Jing Ke's attempt on Ying Zheng's life would be a celebrated story in Chinese history.

Jones is part of the rap-rave group Die Antwoord. Jones also has had a number of acting roles, including a self-styled role as Ninja in the 2015 Neill Blomkamp film Chappie.  Early life  Jones was born in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1974. According to Die Antwoord bandmate Yolandi Visser, Jones has been on the South African hip hop scene since he was 13. He frequented nightclubs where he would develop his skills as a rapper.  Career   1993–1996: The Original Evergreen  Jones was part of the South African rap band The Original Evergreen, which were signed to Sony Music. He released one single with the group, 'Puff the Magik', which was banned from radio for its controversial lyrics about marijuana usage. He left in 1996 to release a solo album under Chameleon Records.  2001–2002: Memoirs Of A Clone and Max Normal  In 2001, Jones released his debut solo album Memoirs Of A Clone. At the time, he was the lead vocalist of Max Normal, a hip hop act, which released their debut album entitled Songs From The Mall in 2001, which he disbanded in 2002. Their last gig was played with Faithless on the group's 2002 South Africa tour.  2002–2003: The Constructus Corporation  When Jones disbanded Max Normal in early 2002, he and musician Sibot invited Markus Wormstorm and Felix Laband to collaborate on The Constructus Corporation project, which resulted in the concept album and graphic novel The Ziggurat, released on 3 June 2002. Jones asked Anri du Toit, better known as his Die Antwoord bandmate Yolandi Visser to lend vocals for the project. She was credited as Anica the Snuffling. The Constructus Corporation disbanded in 2003.  2005: The Fantastic Kill  In 2005, Jones released his second solo album The Fantastic Kill. It was released in France in 2007 as MC Totally Rad And DJ Fuck Are Fucknrad under the name Fucknrad.  2007–2008: MaxNormal.TV  In 2007, Jones resurrected and revamped Max Normal as the 'corporate' hip- hop group \\"MaxNormal.TV.\\" The new lineup consisted of Watkin Tudor Jones revising as Max Normal, and Anri du Toit as Yolandi Visser. The band also featured Neon Don playing various recurring characters and Justin De Nobrega making instrumentals. The group released their debut and only album Good Morning South Africa in 2008. A DVD featuring 13 skits, music videos and short films was released in the same year, titled Goeie More Zuid Afrika.  2008–present: Die Antwoord  Jones is currently a member of the South African rap-rave group Die Antwoord. The group was formed by Jones as Ninja, Anri du Toit as ¥o-Landi Vi$$er and producer Justin De Nobrega as HITEK5000 (formerly referred to as DJ Hi-Tek and God). They have since added a second producer Lil2Hood. Die Antwoord is part of the South African counterculture movement known as Zef. The band released their debut album $O$ in 2009. It was made freely available online and attracted international attention for their music video \\"Enter the Ninja\\". They briefly signed with Interscope Records, and left after pressure from the label to be more generic. du Toit explained that Interscope \\"kept pushing us to be more generic\\" in order to make more money: \\"If you try to make songs that other people like, your band will always be shit. You always gotta do what you like. If it connects, it's a miracle, but it happened with Die Antwoord.\\". They formed their own independent label, Zef Recordz and released their second album Tension through it. They have since released 2 other albums; Donker Mag in 2014, and Mount Ninji and da Nice Time Kid in 2016. As well as this, Jones played a self-styled role as Ninja in the 2015 Neill Blomkamp film Chappie. Controversy  Zheani Sparkes and sexual assault allegations  In March 2019, Australian musician Zheani Sparkes released a diss track titled \\"The Question\\" detailing an alleged sexual assault on her by Jones in South Africa in 2013. Sparkes claimed that Jones drugged her, as well as human traffick[ed] her to Africa, and sent sexually explicit photos of her to cast members of Chappie. He also expressed having an active interest in her because of her resemblance to his now teenage daughter, Sixteen Jones, who in 2013, was only 8 years old. A conflict between Die Antwoord and Sparkes ensued on social media afterwards, where Jones accused Sparkes of catfishing him. In September 2019, Sparkes filed a police report in Queensland, Australia formalizing her accusations of sexual assault and revenge porn. Italian-American singer Dionna Dal Monte also accused Jones of sexual assault, which she claimed occurred at a Die Antwoord show in 2014. Jones has denied all these allegations.  Fight against Andy Butler  In 2019, a video from 2012 surfaced, showing Jones and Die Antwoord bandmate Yolandi Visser fighting Hercules and Love Affair founder Andy Butler while calling him insults that could be seen as homophobic, such as \\"faggot\\". Butler openly identifies as gay. After fighting him, Visser and Jones alert security staff, and, while crying, Visser claims she was sexually assaulted in a bathroom by Butler. Later on in the video, Jones tells her that her performance was \\"Oscar-winning\\". Jones responded on Facebook, claiming that the person who filmed the video edited it to make it seem like he and Visser were in the wrong. He claims that Butler harassed them in the days leading up to the fight, and that it had nothing to do with him being gay. Jones also claimed that he told Visser to act as \\"dramatic as possible\\" about what Butler did to avoid getting detained by security after the fight. Die Antwoord was subsequently dropped from the lineup of several upcoming festivals.  Personal life  Jones has a daughter, Sixteen Jones, born in 2005 from a previous relationship with Die Antwoord bandmate Yolandi Visser. He also has 3 adopted children. Tokkie and his sister Meisie were adopted in 2010, and Jemile was adopted in 2015. Jones lives in Cape Town.

History Gauda and Pandua Gauda was once the \\"capital of the ancient bhukti or political division of Bengal known as Pundravardhana which lay on the eastern extremity of the Gupta Empire.\\" During the rule of the Sena Dynasty, in the 11th-12th century, Gauda was rebuilt and extended as Lakshmanawati (later Lakhnauti), and it became the hub of the Sena empire. Gauda was conquered by Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji in 1205. During the Turko-Afghan period, \\"the city of Lakhnauti or Gauda continued to function initially as their capital but was abandoned in 1342 by the Ilyas Shahi sultans in favour of Pandua because of major disturbances along the river course of the Ganga.\\" \\"Pandua then lay on the banks of the Mahananda, which was the major waterway of the sultanate at the time. However, when the Mahananda too began to veer away from the site of Pandua in the mid-15th century, Gauda was rebuilt and restored to the status of capital city by the Hussain Shahi sultans\\"... With the ascent of Akbar to the Mughal throne at Delhi... the Mughals annexed the ancient region of Gauda in 1576 and created the Diwani of Bengal. The centre of regional power shifted across the Ganga to Rajmahal, Following the demise of the independent sultanate, the regional importance of the Gauda or Malda region declined irreversibly and the city of Gauda was eventually abandoned. Malda district With the advent of the British, their trading and commercial interests focused on the new cities of Malda and English Bazar. Malda district was formed in 1813 with \\"some portion of outlying areas of Purnia, Dinajpur and Rajshahi districts\\". A separate treasury was established in 1832 and a full-fledged Magistrate and Collector was posted in 1859. Malda district was part of Rajshahi Division till 1876, when it was transferred to Bhagalpur Division, and again transferred in 1905 to Rajshahi Division. With the partition of Bengal in 1947, the Radcliffe Line placed Malda district in India, except the Nawabganj subdivision, which was placed in East Pakistan. Geography Kaliachak I community development block is located at Kaliachak I CD Block is part of the Diara, one of the three physiographic sub-regions of the district. \\"The Diara is a relatively well drained flat land formed by the fluvial deposition of newer alluvium in the transitional zone between the Barind upland and the marshy Tal tract. The soil is light with sandy appearance and is very fertile. Mango gardens are common and mulberry is also grown in this natural division.\\" It covers 32.16% of the total area of the district. 42.81% of the population of the district live in this sub-region. Left bank erosion of the Ganges upstream of Farakka Barrage has rendered nearly 4.5 lakh people homeless in Manikchak, Kaliachak I, II and III and Ratua blocks over the last three decades of the past century. The worst hit area is between Bhutnidiara and Panchanandapore in Kaliachak II block.

North Bengal in general, and Malda in particular, has been witness to large scale population movement from other states in India and other districts of West Bengal, as well as from outside the country. The District Human Development Report for Malda notes, \\"Malda district has been a principal recipient of the human migration waves of the 20th century.\\" There are reports of Bangladeshi infiltrators coming through the international border.

History Gauda and Pandua Gauda was once the \\"capital of the ancient bhukti or political division of Bengal known as Pundravardhana which lay on the eastern extremity of the Gupta Empire.\\" During the rule of the Sena Dynasty, in the 11th-12th century, Gauda was rebuilt and extended as Lakshmanawati (later Lakhnauti), and it became the hub of the Sena empire. Gauda was conquered by Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji in 1205. During the Turko-Afghan period, \\"the city of Lakhnauti or Gauda continued to function initially as their capital but was abandoned in 1342 by the Ilyas Shahi sultans in favour of Pandua because of major disturbances along the river course of the Ganga.\\" \\"Pandua then lay on the banks of the Mahananda, which was the major waterway of the sultanate at the time. However, when the Mahananda too began to veer away from the site of Pandua in the mid-15th century, Gauda was rebuilt and restored to the status of capital city by the Hussain Shahi sultans\\"... With the ascent of Akbar to the Mughal throne at Delhi... the Mughals annexed the ancient region of Gauda in 1576 and created the Diwani of Bengal. The centre of regional power shifted across the Ganga to Rajmahal, , Following the demise of the independent sultanate, the regional importance of the Gauda or Malda region declined irreversibly and the city of Gauda was eventually abandoned. Malda district With the advent of the British, their trading and commercial interests focussed on the new cities of Malda and English Bazar. Malda district was formed in 1813 with \\"some portion of outlying areas of Purnia, Dinajpur and Rajshahi districts\\". A separate treasury was established in 1832 and a full-fledged Magistrate and Collector was posted in 1859. Malda district was part of Rajshahi Division till 1876, when it was transferred to Bhagalpur Division, and again transferred in 1905 to Rajshahi Division. With the partition of Bengal in 1947, the Radcliffe Line placed Malda district in India, except the Nawabganj subdivision, which was placed in East Pakistan. Geography Manikchak is located at Manikchak CD Block is part of the Diara, one of the three physiographic sub-regions of the district. \\"The Diara is a relatively well drained flat land formed by the fluvial deposition of newer alluvium in the transitional zone between the Barind upland and the marshy Tal tract. The soil is light with sandy appearance and is very fertile. Mango gardens are common and mulberry is also grown in this natural division.\\" It covers 32.16% of the total area of the district. 42.81% of the population of the district live in this sub-region.

History Gauda and Pandua Gauda was once the “capital of the ancient bhukti or political division of Bengal known as Pundravardhana which lay on the eastern extremity of the Gupta Empire.” During the rule of the Sena Dynasty, in the 11th-12th century, Gauda was rebuilt and extended as Lakshmanawati (later Lakhnauti), and it became the hub of the Sena empire. Gauda was conquered by Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji in 1205. During the Turko-Afghan period, “the city of Lakhnauti or Gauda continued to function initially as their capital but was abandoned in 1342 by the Ilyas Shahi sultans in favour of Pandua because of major disturbances along the river course of the Ganga.” “Pandua then lay on the banks of the Mahananda, which was the major waterway of the sultanate at the time. However, when the Mahananda too began to veer away from the site of Pandua in the mid-15th century, Gauda was rebuilt and restored to the status of capital city by the Hussain Shahi sultans”… With the ascent of Akbar to the Mughal throne at Delhi… the Mughals annexed the ancient region of Gauda in 1576 and created the Diwani of Bengal. The centre of regional power shifted across the Ganga to Rajmahal,,, Following the demise of the independent sultanate, the regional importance of the Gauda or Malda region declined irreversibly and the city of Gauda was eventually abandoned. Malda district With the advent of the British, their trading and commercial interests focused on the new cities of Malda and English Bazar. Malda district was formed in 1813 with “some portion of outlying areas of Purnia, Dinajpur and Rajshahi districts”. A separate treasury was established in 1832 and a full-fledged Magistrate and Collector was posted in 1859. Malda district was part of Rajshahi Division till 1876, when it was transferred to Bhagalpur Division, and again transferred in 1905 to Rajshahi Division. With the partition of Bengal in 1947, the Radcliffe Line placed Malda district in India, except the Nawabganj subdivision, which was placed in East Pakistan. Geography Habibpur community development block is located at Habibpur CD Block is a part of the Barind Tract, one of the three physiographic subregions of the district, that spreads beyond the boundaries of the district. “This region is made up of the ancient alluvial humps that are remnants of old riverine flood plains that remained unaffected subsequently by inundation and renewed silting.” It forms an upland slightly higher than the surrounding areas. Habibpur and Bamangola CD Blocks constitute the Tangon-Punarbhaba interfluves area.

A member of the Republican Party, he is the son of the 44th Vice President of the United States, Dan Quayle. Prior to serving in Congress he worked as an associate lawyer and eventually founded his own security company. In the 2010 Republican primary he defeated 10 other candidates before winning the general election. In his first bid for re-election, due to redistricting, he faced a Republican challenge from fellow Representative David Schweikert, ultimately losing the seat in the primary. After leaving Congress, he joined the lobbying firm Clark Hill and currently works for advocacy firm Hobart Hallaway Quayle. Early life, education, and career Quayle was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana on November 5, 1976, three days after his father was first elected to the United States House of Representatives. As a child, Quayle frequently visited the White House with his family during the Reagan administration. Quayle moved to the Phoenix, Arizona area with his family in 1996. He graduated from Duke University in 1998 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and earned his Juris Doctor from Vanderbilt University Law School in 2002. Quayle has been admitted to the Arizona, New York, and California bar. Quayle worked as an associate lawyer at Schulte Roth & Zabel from 2004 to 2005, and Snell & Wilmer from 2006 to 2007. In 2007 Quayle founded Tynwald Capital, a firm specializing in the acquisition and nurturing of small businesses. He was a founding member of APG-Southwest, a full-service provider of security services for businesses, for which he served as the managing partner of its Arizona branch. Quayle currently works for the Washington lobbying firm Clark Hill. U.S. House of Representatives Elections ;2010 Quayle was a member of the Tea Party movement, which had many of its members swept into office during the 2010 elections. After Republican Congressman John Shadegg decided to retire, Quayle launched his campaign following his father's announcement on America Live with Megyn Kelly that Ben was a candidate for . On August 11, 2010, Quayle released an advertisement in which he called Barack Obama the \\"worst President in history\\". Quayle's prior involvement with the controversial rumor and gossip website \\"DirtyScottsdale.com\\" complicated his run for office. According to the site's founder, Quayle was one of the \\"original contributors\\" to the site, which covered Scottsdale nightlife with features including sexy photos of women, and was the predecessor to the gossip website TheDirty.com. Quayle initially denied the rumors, before admitting several weeks later that he did, in fact, write material for the site using the pen name Brock Landers. Quayle won the 10-candidate Republican primary on August 24, 2010 with a plurality of 23% of the vote. In the general election in November, Quayle defeated Democratic candidate Jon Hulburd 52%–41%. ;2012 After redistricting, Quayle's district was renumbered the , while his home in Phoenix was drawn into the . But Quayle's home was just a few yards outside the 6th, leading a source close to Quayle to tell National Journal that Quayle would run in his original district. While the 6th is as heavily Republican as its predecessor, the 9th was drawn as a fair-fight district. On February 6, 2012, Quayle confirmed that he would run in the 6th. He faced fellow freshman Republican Congressman David Schweikert in the Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district. In an unusual twist, Schweikert's home in Fountain Hills had been drawn into the 6th, while Quayle's home had been drawn into the 9th, the geographic successor to Schweikert's 5th. During the bitter primary campaign, Schweikert was widely criticized for a mailer that accused Quayle of \\"going both ways\\", suggesting that he was bisexual. On the reverse, the mailer listed issues on which it claimed Quayle had taken both liberal and conservative positions. Senator Jon Kyl said that \\"such campaign tactics insult the voters, degrade politics and expose those who stoop to them as unworthy of high office\\" and Senator John McCain said the mailer was one of the \\"worst that I have seen\\" and that it \\"crosses the boundary of decent political dialogue and discourse\\". Quayle's spokeswoman called the mailer \\"utterly false\\" and \\"a sleazy smear tactic\\". Schweikert's spokesman responded that people \\"should get their minds out of the gutter\\" because the mailer was \\"obviously\\" referring to \\"both ways—as in liberal and conservative\\". The Arizona Republic asked two political scientists to review the mailer, who both said that they had \\"never seen anybody accuse someone of flip-flopping [on political issues] that way\\" and said it was \\"difficult to believe\\" that the sexual suggestion was unintentional. Although the 6th contained almost two- thirds of Quayle's constituents, Schweikert defeated Quayle in the Republican primary with 53% of the vote. Matt Jette, a business professor at the Thunderbird School of Global Management who ran for governor of Arizona as a Republican in 2010, won the Democratic nomination. Schweikert defeated Jette in the November 6, 2012, general election with 62% of the vote. Tenure After being elected to Congress, Quayle announced that he would opt out of the taxpayer-funded Congressional health care and pension plan. In 2012 Quayle was named \\"The Most Conservative Member of the House of Representatives\\" by the National Journal. He was awarded the 2011 \\"National Taxpayers’ Friend Award\\" by the National Taxpayers Union, the \\"Spirit of Enterprise Award\\" by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and was given a 98% scorecard by the Club for Growth. Controversy arose after a bill to increase combat pay for military personnel was rejected, and Quayle and David Schweikert high-fived, happy about the bill's failure. After the incident, Maria Meacham, the mother of an active- duty soldier upset about the vote, began shouting from the gallery, and was removed by security.

It was written by Michele Anna Jordan and was published by William Morrow Cookbooks in the United States in June 2003. Jordan is a food writer and has written for The Press Democrat; The BLT Cookbook is her 14th published book. She researched the book for ten years and in the process she taste-tested hundreds of variations on the sandwich, describing it as America's most beloved sandwich. She instructs the reader on how to acquire and prepare the best ingredients for the sandwich. The book includes recipes with varying ingredients, though each recipe includes tomatoes. Many recipes in the book are not sandwiches, and include appetizers, soups, salads, and desserts. Jordan also suggests wines to accompany the sandwich. The book was positively received, and the National Pork Board highly recommended it. A review in The Detroit News said that the book includes \\"mouthwatering recipes\\", and the San Francisco Chronicle called it a \\"neat little book\\" on the subject. The food editor for the Daily Herald wrote that the book's recipes \\"will surely shake up your next toasted meal\\". The Anchorage Daily News called it the \\"definitive book\\" on the BLT sandwich. Content summary The BLT Cookbook discusses the author's love of the BLT sandwich, which according to Jordan is \\"America's favorite sandwich\\". The author wrote, \\"There are times when the BLT just tastes right, primal and true, the best thing you could ever eat. The play of the salt and acid, the silk of the tomato against the salt crunch of the bacon ... It is sheer delight.\\" She discusses ways the combination can be used in soups, appetizers, and salads. Recipes are provided for multiple versions of the BLT sandwich. Jordan writes that to make the best sandwich, one should select the finest ingredients. She recommends shopping at farmers' markets for fresh tomatoes, a butcher for choice bacon, and a bakery for fresh bread. The author recommends mayonnaise brands Hellmann's and Best Foods, and Niman bacon from California. Jordan writes, \\"For lettuce, remove the first outer leaf and then use only the next three layers. Further in, iceberg lettuce gets a little cabbagey.\\" The BLT Cookbook begins with a recipe for a mini-cocktail selection of the BLT, followed by a larger version that the author recommends for large gatherings such as picnics. Non-traditional presentations of the BLT combination include \\"Tomatoes Stuffed with Bacon Risotto\\", \\"Potato Soup with Tomatoes and Bacon\\" and \\"Tomato Bread Pudding\\". The author presents varieties of the BLT that omit one ingredient. \\"The Fisherman's BLT\\"which uses seafoodis an alternative to the standard sandwich and the \\"ZLT\\" comprises zucchini, lettuce and tomato. Jordan was inspired by a salmon sandwich she bought at Pike Place Market in Seattle to create a BLT sandwich with salmon. The \\"Bacon, Leek and Tomato Strudel\\" is a dish that does not use bread. All recipes presented in The BLT Cookbook include tomatoes. Towards the end of the book, recipes for bread pudding, strudel and tomato pie are included. Selected wines that Jordan recommends to accompany her dishes include a Rhone-style red, beaujolais, or pinot noir. Background Food writer Michele Anna Jordan has contributed columns published in the food and wine section of The Press Democrat. and restaurant reviews for the San Francisco Chronicle. The BLT Cookbook is Jordan's 14th book. She decided to write about the BLT sandwich after discovering it was a good remedy for morning sickness, and that others who frequented a food website shared her love of the BLT. Jordan spent ten years researching for the book, and spent a winter writing it. During her research, Jordan taste-tested hundreds of variations on the BLT sandwich. In 2003 the author hosted two radio programs on KRCB-FM, \\"Mouthful with Michele Anna Jordan\\" and \\"Red Shoes Rodeo\\". The year the book was published, Jordan crafted a BLT sandwich at the Kendall-Jackson Tomato Festival. Reception The BLT Cookbook is \\"highly recommended\\" by the National Pork Board. Kate Lawson of The Detroit News wrote that the book offers \\"mouthwatering recipes ranging from variations on the classic sandwich to soups, salads and pastas.\\" Karola Saekel of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, \\"Recipes for recommended basics like aioli and tomato concasse round out the neat little book.\\" Food editor of the Daily Herald Deborah Pankey wrote in her review of the book, \\"While giving the titled trio its due respect, author Michele Anna Jordan introduces a host of other ingredients that will surely shake up your next toasted meal (yes, she favors toast to help maintain the sandwich's structure.)\\" The Cincinnati Post said, \\"[Jordan's] book presents practically all the possibilities for BLT combinations as she leaves the two slices of white toast far behind\\". Staff writer for ANG Newspapers Jolene Thym wrote, \\"Not simply a cookbook, the little handbook is a discourse on the sandwich that is elegant enough to coax even the most virtuous eaters to gobble pork fat and mayonnaise with abandon.\\" T.C. Mitchell of the Anchorage Daily News said The BLT Cookbook is the \\"definitive book\\" on the sandwich.

It is a dramatization of Hezarfen Ahmet Çelebi's reported flight across the Bosphorus from Galata. Plot The film takes place in the 17th century. Two brothers Hezarfen Ahmet Çelebi and his brother Lagari Hasan Çelebi are researching bird flight. The new Sultan Murat IV resists the domination of his mother, the Valide Kösem Sultan and tries to enforce strict law and order in the empire. Meanwhile, a Venetian ship that has been captured by Algerian pirates is brought into Istanbul. One of those on the ship is a girl with a manuscript showing how to fly, the latter of which comes into Hezarfen's possession. However, this manuscript can't be deciphered by anyone. Hezarfen and Hasan are caught examining a dead body (which is against the law) and sent to be executed. At the intervention of the Sultan, they are sent for a court trial. Hasan tries to justify the research and experiments by claiming that they could be used as a weapon to defeat the enemies of the Ottomans. Murat forbids experiments on dead human bodies but gives his blessing to the duo's research on flying, hoping for a new army of flying soldiers that could get past ground level barriers like walls and the sea, and drop bombs. To go about their task, Hezarfen and Hasan tell Murat of the undecipherable script and ask him to release the girl from the dungeon. The script belongs to Leonardo da Vinci and they realise that he too had the same idea of flying with wings, but the text is coded so they are unable to read it. Hezarfan and the girl (whose name turns out to be Franceska) fall in love. After witnessing some fireworks, Hasan tries experimenting with rockets and during a grand launch, manages to reach a reasonable altitude before bailing out and landing in the water below. When some drinks are accidentally spilt on the manuscript, the coded text becomes visible and Hezarfen uses his own ideas and that of Da Vinci's to build a flying machine consisting of artificial wings. The conservative Şeyh- ül İslam who is against Hezarfen tries to turn the Sultan against him. He succeeds when the Sultan bans Hezarfen from flying and orders his arrest. Hezarfen (with Franceska) manages to escape with the help of Evliya Çelebi to the Maiden's Tower and launches his flying machine across the Bosporus.

He is widely recognised for attending every home match the Indian team has played since 2007. For some overseas tours, he also collects funds from the cricket loving public. He is usually seen in stadium with his body painted in the national colours of India, waving the national flag in the live telecast of the matches. Personal life Sudhir Choudhary was born in a very poor family in a semi-rural place of Muzaffarpur, Bihar. He became obsessed with Indian cricket and a fan of Sachin Tendulkar at the age of 6. He left his studies at the age of 14 when he was in his secondary school. He is unemployed, having previously worked for a milk company and trained as a teacher. He postponed his marriage so that he could watch all the matches played by the Indian cricket team, and wants to follow the team all over the world, wherever it plays. This style of living followed by Sudhir Kumar has made his parents unhappy, and he once threatened self-immolation if he was not assured of watching all cricket matches played by the Indian cricket team. He declared that his life is dedicated to watching Indian cricket matches and he lives his life on public support. Sudhir Kumar is one of three principal roles of a documentary film Beyond All Boundaries which tells the stories of three different personalities of Indian cricket and he is shown as a super fan of the sport. Made by film maker Sushrut Jain, the film shows details about the personal life of Sudhir Kumar. After the retirement of Sachin Tendulkar, Sudhir keeps cheering for the Indian cricket team sporting \\"Miss-U Tendulkar\\" on his body. Cricket fan Sudhir Chaudhary at the Chepauk stadium, Chennai Since 2003, Sudhir Chaudhary's passion has been to watch cricket matches played by India and to support the team. By April 2010, he had attended approximately 150 matches, often traveling by bicycle to reach the venue of match. He sometimes pedals his cycle to cricket playing venues, as he did to Bangladesh to witness a cricket match in 2007 and to Lahore, Pakistan in 2006. To save money, he sometimes braves ticketless travel in trains to reach venues.http://www.cricketcountry.com/cricket-articles/Sachin-Tendulkar-s-most- dedicated-fan-to-complete-a-decade-of-god-worship/32398 When attending cricket matches, he paints his body with the tri- colour, the colours of India flag, and he usually paints the name of Tendulkar on his chest. He carries a conch with him and blows the conch to announce the arrival of the India cricket team. Sudhir Chaudhary paints his body on the previous day of a match and skips sleep that night to preserve the paint on his body. He cycled for 21 days from Muzaffarpur, Bihar to Mumbai to watch Sachin play for India against Australia on 28 October 2003 and this was the first tri-series match where he started supporting India by waving Indian tri-colour.  2011 ICC Cricket World Cup  During the World Cup, Sudhir sported a kooky crown - a replica World Cup trophy. Sudhir's crowning moment came on April 2, 2011, the day India defeated Sri Lanka in the final at Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai, to become the world champions. Sachin Tendulkar himself signaled Sudhir who was sitting among the cheering Indian fans, to come to the Indian dressing room and join the team's celebrations. Tendulkar asked Zaheer Khan to bring the World Cup over. Tendulkar shook hands with Sudhir Gautam, hugged him and finally let him lift the cup from Zaheer’s hands. Tendulkar allowed Sudhir to hold the World Cup along with him and Sudhir celebrated the occasion by posing for photographs. Sudhir chanted ’India’ as he lifted the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 trophy. Apology by the police In March 2010, a Senior Police officer intercepted and thrashed Sudhir Kumar in Kanpur, when he tried to shake hands with Sachin Tendulkar during a practice session. Later, after Tendulkar's intervention and request he was let off, and the police officer tendered an apology to Sudhir Kumar, repenting the event. Sudhir Kumar stopped the practice of scaling fences to reach the team to celebrate a win, only after Tendulkar advised against such practice. After this incident, the BCCI has sponsored Sudhir Kumar for every match.  Attack by Bangladesh Cricket fans  In 2015, during India - Bangladesh series in Mirpur, he was attacked and harassed by Bangladesh fans booing against India, when he was trying to leave the stadium. He feared for his life but was eventually rescued by Bangladesh Police.

Prehistoric time (until around 1000 AD)  Four grain types dominated in the Nordic countries: barley and rye are the oldest; wheat and oats are more recent. During the Iron Age (500 AD – 1050 AD), rye became the most commonly used grain, followed by barley and oats. Rye was also the most commonly used grain for bread up until the beginning of the 20th century. Today, older grain types such as emmer and spelt are once again being cultivated and new bread types are being developed from these grains. Archaeological finds in Denmark indicate use of the two triticum (wheat) species, emmer and einkorn, during the Mesolithic Period (8900 BC – 3900 BC). There is no direct evidence of bread-making, but cereals have been crushed, cooked and served as porridge since at least 4,200 BC. During the Neolithic Period (3900 BC – 1800 BC), when agriculture was introduced, barley seems to have taken over to some extent, and ceramic plates apparently used for baking are found. Moulded cereals, with water added to make a dough and baked or fried in the shape of bread, are known as burial gifts in Iron Age graves (200 AD onwards) in the Mälardalen area of central Sweden. However, it is not certain that this bread was eaten; it could just have been a burial gift. During the Bronze Age (1800 BC – 500 AD), oats and the triticum species spelt seem to have been the most commonly used grains, and we see the first real ovens, probably used for baking small loaves and perhaps the first bread (probably around 400 AD). Scandinavian soldiers in Roman times apparently learned baking techniques when working as mercenaries in the Roman army (200–400 AD). They subsequently took the technique home with them to show that they had been employed in high status work on the continent. Early Christian traditions promoted an interest in bread. Culturally, German traditions have influenced most of the bread types in the Nordic countries. In the eastern part of Finland, there is a cultural link to Russia and Slavic bread traditions. In the Nordic countries, bread was the main part of a meal until the late 18th century. Four different bread regions can be found in the Nordic area in the late 19th century. In the south, soft rye bread dominated. Further north came crisp bread, usually baked with rye, then thin and crispy barley bread. In the far north, soft barley loaves dominated. During the 19th century, potatoes began to become the centrepiece of meals and bread was put aside as an extra source of carbohydrates in a meal. Bread still retained its key function for breakfast, as the open sandwich is a starter for most Nordic people today and potatoes are used as a centrepiece in lunches and dinners. A history of Nordic bread from around 1000 AD and some contemporary types and bread innovations is presented below. Countries are presented in alphabetic order (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden). The names of the bread types are mostly given in both the contemporary national language and in English.  Denmark  History Not much is known about the bread types used in Denmark up until the Middle Ages, but we believe that they were mostly unleavened and that the flour was a mixture of various types of grain, as a pure monoculture was probably not possible at the time. Rye bread was still baked at farms well into the 19th century, as most people lived in the countryside. The loaves were oblong in shape, made from ground whole rye, leavened with sour dough and sometimes sweetened with malt syrup. The loaves weighed up to 15–16 kg. They were baked once a month, as heating the oven was both time-consuming and used a lot of firewood. The bakers in the towns baked their rye bread for the day. We only know little about the other types of bread in the olden times. More refined bread types for special occasions and feasts were prepared from sifted rye flour, and loaves made from wheat must have been eaten. Around 1400, the emblem of the bakers’ guild became the triangular skonrogge (i.e. a small leavened rye bread that is cleaved and baked again until dry, also Danish beskøjt, French biscuit, Latin bis-coctus: baked twice). Around 1600, the skonrogge was replaced as the baker’s emblem by the pretzel-shaped kringle, which is still the emblem of the bakers’ guild today. We find the first systematic description of Danish bread in 1821 in Charles Adolph Dénys Mourier’s book on bread and bread-making. He describes various leavened bread types: rugbrød (whole rye bread), franskbrød (white wheat bread), sigtebrød (sifted rye bread) and tvebakker (wheat biscuits), as well as unleavened bread types: fladbrød (wheat, rye, oats, bran in various combinations) and wafers. Today In the late 19th century, Danish bakers in the larger towns created the idea of freshly baked bread in the morning (morgenbrød) in various shapes and with a variety of seasonings, baked from wheat intended for the rising bourgeoisie. Since then, freshly baked bread has been produced in every Danish baker’s shop together with all the other kinds of bread. This decentralised form of baking bread alongside the industrialised production of bread seems to be characteristic of the Danish bread sector. The quality of Danish bread declined in the latter part of the 20th century, but it has dramatically recovered during the past 20 years due to many factors: a growing interest in bread, criticism from gastronomes, the marketing of better quality flour, better baking entrepreneurship, top restaurants baking their own bread and, last but not least, inspiration from immigrants. Consumption has to a great extent switched from rye bread to wheat bread. 21st century innovations New types of flour have played a pivotal role in the improvements in Danish bread. Aurion, a Danish organic company, has spearheaded these improvements by obtaining interesting types of grain from many sources, e.g. The Nordic Gene Bank and a few grain types found in an old farmhouse. This strategy has resulted in the marketing of organic flour made from emmer, einkorn, spelt, kamut, ølandshvede, durum and svedjerug. Ølandshvedebrød New bakers – The baker’s traditional monopoly in delivering fresh baked bread has been challenged by petrol station outlets selling good quality bake-off bread.Gastronomisk Leksikon, udgivet af Det Danske Gastronomiske Akademi, Gyldendal 1998, revidert udgave udkommer maj 2010.  Finland  History Ruisreikäleipä Centuries ago, bread was an important part of the daily meal; for the poorest households, it was the only meal of the day. Cultivated varieties were barley, which is the oldest cultivated grain, followed by rye and oat; all used for porridge and baking. When grain was scarce, people used many different types of tree bark such as birch and pine as a substitute to make bark bread. Around the 10th century, wheat became a more commonly used cultivated grain, but it did not overtake rye or oats. In the Early Middle Ages, the most commonly used cultivation technique was three- shift cultivation. This type of cultivation method involved using one third of the field for autumn grain (especially rye), one third for spring grain and the rest for fallow. This approach enabled good harvests and provided good pasture for cattle. The method also guaranteed crucial grain supplies for bread flour. Finland’s cultural position between East and West has also left its mark on bread-making. Western Finland was influenced by baking and cultivation techniques from Scandinavia, whereas eastern Finland was exposed to Russian influences. In North Karelia, in eastern Finland, households baked their bread in large ovens several times a week and the bread was eaten fresh. Bread was made from rye and dough heart (sourdough starter) could be hundreds of years’ old, bread raised without added yeast. In western Finland, it was not as common for bread to be baked weekly. Baking happened probably once or twice a month using barley and oats. Added yeast was used in the dough. Before baking, a small hole was made in the corner of the round, flattened bread, and after baking the bread was hung on poles suspended just below the kitchen ceiling to dry and for storage: see ruisreikäleipä. Barley, and sometimes wheat, was used in the western part of Finland. The most frequently cultivated grain was rye, followed by barley. Bread culture in central Finland was influenced by both the East and the West. Bread was also influenced to some extent by Lapland; bread was called “rieska”, but it was much thicker than Lappish rieska. Lapland was strongly influenced by both Swedish Lapland and Norway. The most varied bread traditions in Finland are to be found in the regions of Karelia and Kainuu, where cereals have been ingeniously combined with other natural products such as berries, fish and vegetables. Rice is a traditional filling in the Karelian pastry and the latest research show that this influence has a Russian origin, where rice was used in pastries as early as the 17th century. Today In the 19th century, bread-making in the cities moved to local bakeries. Poor households baked their own bread daily in small apartments. The bread consisted of thinner, multigrain breads, elongated sekaleipä mixed-cereal bread. Bread was made from all four of the cereals grown in Finland: wheat, rye, barley and oats, usually ground into various grades. Rye bread can be either light or dark in colour, depending on the type of flour mixture used, and it is typical for rye bread to include about 20% wheat flour. New trends and old traditions are bringing old-fashioned rye breads back to the shelves in shops. These rye breads are made entirely from rye flour and are the most common breads in the Finnish diet. Other types of sour bread are still baked in the residual heat of ovens and the longer baking time at low temperature gives the bread both a darker colour and a higher density and hardness than ordinary rye bread. A few wheat breads are still made in Finland, although most are simple buns or loaves of sliced or unsliced bread. Vesirinkeli, water rings, are small, almost tasteless rings of yeast- leavened wheat bread, which resemble bagels. They are cooked in salted boiling water before being baked. Oats are the most commonly produced grain in Finland and many oat bread types are available, although they are not as popular as rye breads. The most common bread types in Finland are bread rolls or buns, “sämpylä” or flat soft bread pieces. The potato, although a late introduction to Finland in the early 19th century, features heavily in food culture and has found its way into many kinds of bread. Dough made with potato is usually very soft and the bread will be moister and fluffier than plain wheat or oat bread. This bread is widely used, particularly in northern Finland and Lapland. 21st century innovations “Ruisnappi“ – In Tampere, central Finland, a large bakery has invented a rye snack, flavoured with chilli, lemon, onion and garlic. The innovation originated from the idea of using the bread taken from the holes which were removed from traditional round crispbreads, which was considered as waste. Rye hazelnut yoghurt – Finland has its own favorite yoghurt – rye-hazelnut. This product was developed from Finnish rye bread crumbs and yoghurt. Kolmonen, J.

See also :fi:Leipä, Breads of Finland  Iceland  History With the settlement of the country (around 800–900 AD), grain (barley) was brought to Iceland, cultivated and used for bread and porridge. In Mediaeval times, wheat was to some extent imported. However, it was mostly used for bread for chiefs and for oblates. Grain cultivation is thought to have been abandoned before 1600 due to harsher climatic conditions, and subsequently most grains such as barley and rye were imported. Until the late 19th century, wheat was mostly bought by richer people. In the 17th century, rye and barley were the most common grains, with rye becoming more prominent in the 18th and 19th centuries. The issue of a lack of grain was overcome in different ways in different parts of the country. In some areas, grain was made to go further using Dulse (Palmaria palmata; ), Iceland Moss (Cetraria islandica; IS: fjallagrös) or Irish Moss (Chondrus crispus; ) in compotes and breads, or by flattening the dough so thin that the bread became almost transparent. In the SE region (Skaftafellssýslur), locals knew how to use the lyme grass (Leymus arenarius) (; sometimes called the Icelandic grain) for centuries, where it was used in compotes, bread, pancakes, etc. These grain substitutes gave the bread a distinctive character. Dulse breads and biscuits can be made by mixing Dulse, rye, and Icelandic Moss in equal proportions. Only in the last few decades has grain (barley) been cultivated. It is still cultivated on a very small scale, mostly for feed. Other grains, such as varieties of rye and wheat, have been cultivated, although this is still very much at an experimental stage. It was not until the 18th century that it became common practice to make leavened rye breads. Sour dough was mostly used (older rye dough which had started to ferment). These breads were called pottbrauð (pot breads) because they were baked (or rather steamed) on a stove under a pot (upside down) – i.e. a kind of oven. Around 1900, it was common to bake these breads in sealed containers (i.e. from imported sweets, today often from milk cartons). When ovens became a household item, the containers were placed in them. Where thermal springs were available nearby, they were (and still are) used to bake these dark, moist and rather sweet breads (taking up to 24 hours). Rye breads baked in hot springs are a popular item today, being served for local consumption as well as for tourists. In general, stock fish () was served as a bread substitute, eaten with butter on the side with almost every meal. Today, stock fish has lost its role as a bread substitute. It is however still eaten in the same way, either with or without butter. It is a popular snack, which has found a new target group within the sports food sector due to its high protein content and favourable amino acid content. There have always been some imported breads in Iceland (as indicated by reports from the 14th century). However, these breads where mostly consumed by chiefs/richer people until the 20th century. Foreign sailors often paid for services on land with different kinds of bread (double-baked bread, cookies, skonrogge, etc.). Today Most types of breads available in other Western countries are now also available in Iceland, either baked in Iceland or imported. Everyday bread is mostly made by industrial bakeries or bought at the local bakery. However, baking at home is still a common practice amongst young and older households alike, especially in connection with having guests and celebrations. Both traditional recipes and modern/new recipes are popular, with new methods replacing older ones to some extent. Of the bread types currently available, flatbrauð (flatbread) and laufabrauð (leaf bread) have the longest traditions. Flatbrauð came in various sizes and thicknesses and was made from rye-flour and hot water. Sometimes wheat was added as well. The bread was kneaded and flattened into a round form by a cake roller or by hand, picked and baked on a hot stove or in ashes. Before the Second World War, flatbrauð was only served with a meal. However, since then it has become a popular feature on the coffee table. Today, flatbrauð with hangikjöt (smoked, cooked lamb, in thin slices) is often served, both in restaurants and at home. Several types of fried bread can be categorised as traditional; laufabrauð (leaf bread), kleinur (bows), lummur (small pancakes), pönnukökur (crêpes). With the exception of laufabrauð, none of these is mentioned in written records until the late 18th century. Laufabrauð is sometimes called “snowflake bread” in English because of its intricate cut-out pattern. Through the centuries, it was probably only served to chiefs, made from wheat and sugar and fried with butter. By the 19th century, it had become a festival bread for public consumption. At the time, it was made from cheaper ingredients, barley and rye meal, and fried in sheep fat (tólg). In the late 19th century, laufabrauð was a festival bread in the north and northeast, mostly at Christmas. Since then, the tradition has spread across the whole country. Making this crispy bread is still a popular family event today and for many an essential part of the Christmas preparations. Dozens of family members or friends will often spend an entire December afternoon kneading, rolling, decorating and frying the bread, which is then kept until Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, when it is eaten with smoked lamb. 21st century innovations “Mýbiti” (Midge bite) – Students from The Icelandic Academy of Arts have developed a local “fastfood” in cooperation with farmers around lake Mývatn (Midge lake). The “fastfood” is a sandwich made from rye bread that is baked in the hot springs nearby and shaped to resemble a unique green algae, lakeball (; Aegagropila linnaei), which is found in the lake (this algae is only found in a few lakes in the world). The sandwich is then filled with local ingredients, such as smoked Arctic char. Rye bread ice cream – Café Loki in Reykjavík is an example of a café/restaurant that is experimenting with new applications of rye bread. One of its recent products is an ice cream spiced with roasted and ground rye bread (similar to krokant).  Norway  History Since the early history of Norway, two types of bread have been mentioned: the white wheat loafs in the homes of noblemen and the heavy loafs of coarse bread in the thrall’s cabin. Barley is the oldest grain and dominated in the mountainous northern parts of the region, while oats were most common in humid areas. Because of the cold climate, rye and wheat were cultivated only in southern Norway, and importing was necessary. Wheat products were very exclusive and primarily enjoyed by the elite on festive occasions. Wheat was also used in the holy bread in churches. The coarse loafs were simply made from flour or crushed grain that was kneaded with hot water or some other liquid and shaped into a flat cake of dough. These cakes were placed on a flat stone beside the fire, in the ashes or on the embers of the fire. They were used as a bread plate with fish, meats and vegetables. These breads were mainly baked from barley and oats and had in common the fact that they could not be kept for more than a few days. They needed to be preserved. This led to the development of very thin, dry and crispy flatbreads (flatbrød) that could be stored for many years. Lefserull or wrap For festive occasions, especially Christmas, the Norwegians have a long tradition of making various kinds of very thin flatbread called lefser, tunnbrød, kling, klining or krotekake. Both men and women participate in baking these traditional breads; one rolls the dough and the other fries on wide, flat pans (takke). Lefser can contain fine wheat, fine barley and perhaps potatoes, milk and eggs. After frying, they can be served with meat, sausages or fish. Today, they are used for making wraps with various fillings. In olden days, grain was ground on manually operated rotary querns. However, during the Middle Ages, millstones powered by a waterwheel were introduced, and large amounts of grain could be ground more quickly. These mills depended on a good flow of water, which mainly occurred during the autumn and spring. These two seasons were the time for baking flatbread and lefser. Once rye began to be cultivated around 1500, the baking techniques changed to leaven breads in ovens, e.g. with sour dough and later with other leavens. The rye in oven-baked bread was often mixed with barley for economy. It was only baked once a month, or more often during the summer. During storage, these breads gradually became drier and drier, even if they were carefully wrapped in cloth or placed in grain bins. However, dry bread was also more economical and eating fresh bread was considered a luxury. A high intake of wholegrain bread has been typical of Norwegian bread eating habits for both breakfast and lunch. A special preparation was used to make leavened oven baked bread longer-lasting. This was particularly necessary for ships’ crews on long voyages. This consisted of wholegrain balls cut in two and dried in an oven until dry and crispy. Such bread is called kavring or tvebak, meaning ‘baked twice’, and can be stored for a long time. Today These days, we are travelling more and experiencing globalisation, new immigrants are bringing their cuisines, classic national and regional products are being revitalised, high-end restaurants for the business elite are springing up, and we are seeing a growing interest in healthy organic food. A research report from 2008 shows that eight out of ten respondents reported eating bread for breakfast and lunch regularly. However, few of them reported eating bread for their evening meal. The report also shows that bread and bread meals have a high food cultural value in Norway. Six out of ten considered taking a packed lunch (matpakke) to work or school a good habit and something that they enjoyed. Many new types of bread have reached the market in recent years. A high percentage of people reported eating bread types such as spelt, specialty, gourmet, and fibre/bran bread, as well as ciabattas and baguettes, regularly, although very few reported doing so on a daily basis. Norwegian bakers now have competition from abroad. The wholegrain bread from local bakers must give way to huge lorry loads of baguettes and frozen dough offering cheaper products. 21st century innovations Bank of recipes and information – In 2007, the information office for bread and cereals (Opplysningskontoret for brød og korn) was founded. Their slogan is “Bread for every meal”. Their aim is to increase the consumption of bread and cereals. They have created websites for: Nutrition, Facts, Recipes, School and Press. Last year, they held an innovative competition for pupils to make the best school bread.  Sweden  Thin bread or flatbread in a contemporary square shape. History Since the very beginning, bread-making has always been a male task and associated with high status in Sweden. These first breads were baked using barley flour, or perhaps wheat for thin or flat bread cakes (tunnbröd).Bergström, L., (2008). Gräddat. Thesis and Papers in Scientific Archaeology 9. Stockholm: Stockholms universitet (diss.). Bread became an important item in the new Christian religion (AD 900) for celebrating Holy Communion (bread and wine), which emphasised bread as being both new and important. Thin bread was baked on stones or iron plates or in a large oven, and this tradition is still in existence today. In Medieval times (1100–1200 AD) in central and southern Sweden, rye flour was baked into soft loafs or, in the central regions, into crispbread (knäckebröd, “bread which can be broken”). The crispbread was baked with a hole in the middle so that it could be threaded over a beam and stored suspended from the ceiling. From Medieval times and the introduction of the first simple watermills, these flatbreads and crispbreads were baked only once or twice a year and kept dry in a storage chamber. Contemporary knäckebröd with its traditional hole. Rye flour was sometimes mixed with pea flour or, in times of famine, bark. From the 18th century, it was mixed with grated potatoes to make it last longer. Oatmeal was used in southwestern Sweden to bake thin breads or flatbreads. Sour dough was used as yeast, along with yeast from beer production (from the 19th century).Campbell. Å., (1950). Det svenska brödet: en jämförande etnologisk- historisk undersökning. Stockholm : Svensk bageritidskrift. Around 1860–70, industrial pressed yeast production started to result in more voluminous bread. In southern Sweden, rye bread was more often baked into softer and thick bread cakes (kavring, “round bread”), and from the 19th century flavoured with syrup or molasses. Professional male bakers started to sell bread in the cities during the 13th century. However, in the countryside, everyday bread was baked at home by the women. Swedish recipe books dating from the 17th–18th century contain recipes of cakes, but not everyday bread, indicating that cakes were baked less often and amongst the higher echelons of society. The process of how to make everyday bread was kept among women as tacit knowledge. Bread types in Sweden around the 1880s. Note – the boundaries between the regions fluctuated. A minority group in northern Sweden in the valley of Torneå, known as the Tornedalians, baked a soft bread called rieska (unleavened bread). Quite unlike other types of bread in the surrounding northern region, rieska is a type of bread that does not keep, which is why it is baked daily or weekly. The Sàmi people have also baked soft bread on stones on a more daily basis. The large Finnish minority group in Sweden has eaten a stiffer rye bread baked with sour dough. Bread was historically served in one of two ways, either broken into pieces in a soup or dipped in a hot drink, or served in the form of butter spread on a slice of bread and served as an open sandwich.Keyland, N., (1919). Svensk allmogekost: Bidrag till den svenska folkhushållningens historia. Stockholm: Svenska Teknologföreningen. In regions where they lacked cereals or bread, dried fish has functioned as bread. In order to make it edible, the fish was first beaten with a stone until it became soft. The fish was spread with butter and eaten like a sandwich. Potato came to replace bread as a staple food during the 19th century and bread retained its position as the main component of breakfast, but it became a side-dish to hot luncheons and dinners when potato took over the former central role of bread.Swahn, J.-Ö., (2000). Fil, fläsk och Falukorv. Svenska mattraditioner genom tiderna. Lund: Illustrerad historia. Figure to the right shows the bread regions that existed around 1880, according to Åke Campbell (1950), before industrialisation led to all types of bread becoming available nationwide. Throughout history, the cities have always had a wider variety of bread types, as well as more expensive and higher status bread products in the form of cakes baked with sugar, butter and oriental spices. The boundaries should not be interpreted as being definitive, as cultural ideals always tend to vary along a boundary. Today During the switch to a modern urban and industrialised society, bread types changed when large industrial bakeries introduced new soft bread, which from the early 1920s was often sweetened (sötlimpa, sweet thick bread). From then on, bread was bought from stores and bakeries, rather than baked at home, as had previously been the case. Regional variations decreased due to the transportation and marketing of bread as a national product. The consumption of bread products of various kinds has increased since the 1990s and wholegrain bread and wheat bread are the most popular. All older bread types still exist alongside the new ones, indicating the much greater variety open to individuals today than has been the case in the past. Soft bread consumption has increased by more than 60% since the 1990s, from 30 kg to 50 kg per person and year today (2007). The older types of bread are still eaten in Sweden, but today they are usually professionally baked. New international types such as naan bread, ciabatta, focaccia, pita and bagels have been popular since the 1990s. 20% of Swedes are first- or second-generation immigrants and use bread both as they did in their home countries and as it is used today in contemporary Swedish normative food culture.Swahn, J.-Ö., (2002). Matens historia. Historia B för gymnasiet. Stockholm: Natur & Kultur. 21st century innovations Bread Ice Cream – In Grythyttan in central Sweden, the local ice cream and chocolate shop has invented a new ice cream. They have taken an ordinary white vanilla ice cream and flavoured it with dry crispbread of rye (knäckebröd). Small pieces of the bread are also added to the ice cream, giving it the texture of both smooth ice cream and hard and sometime soggy bites of the crispbread. The ice cream is very popular among young people.  Similarities and diversities in Nordic breads  Nordic food culture in the south and east of the region comprises a tradition of baking softer rye breads. In Denmark and especially in Sweden, the soft rye bread is sweeter; in Finland, a drier sour rye bread type is traditional. Iceland has for the past hundred years imported grain to make bread, as grain is not cultivated on the island. Due to the lack of grain, local ingredients such as Dulse or Iceland Moss were sometimes used to partly replace the grain. Soft sweet rye bread has also been baked for centuries in Iceland (i.e. the rye bread baked in hot springs) – the difference is that the rye has been imported from the other Nordic countries. People in the northern regions of Norway, Sweden and Finland have a tradition of baking thin flat, crispy breads using barley. Since Medieval times, bread was only baked once or twice a year and stored in dry chambers. In central Sweden and central Finland, there is a belt where a tradition of baking thin rye bread has developed. A paradox is that amongst people in the northern sub-alpine regions of Norway, Sweden and Finland and amongst the Sámi people, bread has been baked on a weekly basis and eaten as soft bread cakes. In all Nordic countries, dried fish has been used as a bread substitute, being served buttered. Today, international bread types are mixed with the old ones, and bread is used both in food innovations such as yoghurt with bread and fastfood bread and in new meal settings.

Plot The film is set in a rundown, crime ridden neighborhood of Istanbul dubbed \\"Cholera Street\\" (Kolera Sokağı). Salih is a mechanic and son of a respected barber Ali. A woman Tina arrives at Cholera street where she takes up residence and works as a prostitute. Deniz is a gangster who gives himself the nickname \\"Reiss\\" (\\"Chief\\"), tries to take control of the neighbourhood through intimidation. After Reiss takes over a horse stable and causes the suicide of the owner, Arap Sado (a close friend of Salih) challenges Reiss to a knife duel and after defeating him, demands that he leave the neighborhood. One night, a prostitute is murdered with her genitals cut out, and this causes fears of a serial killer on the loose called the \\"Kolera Canavarı\\" (\\"Cholera Monster\\"). Sado is targeted by Reis' men in a drive by shooting and he dies in Salih's arms after giving him his prized pocket knife. With Sado dead, Reiss opens a casino and seeks to dominate the neighbour. At the opening of Sado's bust, Salih and Reiss clash on the street, during which the public defies Reis and side with Salih. Tina invites Salih to her home that night, after which Tina and Salih become a couple. Salih gets Tina to promise that she will give up prostitution, but this causes hardship because they now have no income. The \\"Cholera Monster\\" strikes again and murders \\"Puma\\" Zehra (the madame of a brothel) on Salih's watch. Reiss takes advantage of the situation, declaring himself protector of the neighborhood and turning the public against Salih. Salih becomes suspicious after Tina returns late and confronts her about it. Tina tries to justify her returning to prostitution by saying that they needed money to survive. While Tina runs away from an angry Salih, she is attacked by the \\"Cholera Monster\\" but Salih manages save her and subdue him. Tina's former pimp Nihat is distraught at the loss of his livelihood and his treatment at hands of Tina. He goes to Reis who takes him in and draws up a scheme to get rid of Salih. After being provoked by Reis, Nihat attacks Tina and slashes her cheek with a blade at a wedding. Salih runs him down, kills him and cuts his cheek off with a knife. The corrupt police chief who is under Reis' pay, arrests Salih and tries to force him to confess to the murder. Reis approaches Tina and makes a deal that he will get Salih released if she gives herself to him. When Salih returns home, he finds Reiss and Tina together in bed; he becomes distraught and cuts himself and bleeds to death. As an act of revenge, Tina gets into Reis' car and blows it up with Reiss and herself in it.

Jovanovic, 263 A.D.2d 182, 700 N.Y.S.2d 156 (N.Y. App. Div. 1st Dep't 1999), was a highly publicized criminal case in New York. In 1996, Oliver Jovanovic (born 1966) was accused of sadomasochistic torture of a woman, later identified as Jamie Rzucek, whom he had met shortly before on the Internet. He was convicted in 1998 and the conviction was overturned on appeal in 1999 because parts of email messages between the two had been improperly excluded as evidence at trial. Rzucek declined to testify during the retrial in 2001 and the case was dropped. The incident In the summer of 1996, Rzucek (then a 20-year-old student at Barnard College), made the acquaintance of Jovanovic (then a graduate student in microbiology at Columbia University) in an internet chat room. They exchanged several email messages and talked on the telephone. In the messages, Jovanovic mentioned Joel-Peter Witkin's photographs of corpses, and Rzucek expressed her interest in snuff films. On November 22, the two met for a dinner date and then went to Jovanovic's apartment, where they watched a Meet the Feebles video. Rzucek later alleged that then she was held there against her will for 20 hours, bound and gagged, sodomized and tortured in various ways. Jovanovic maintained that the acts were consensual. The two exchanged further emails after the event, with Rzucek describing her state at one point as \\"quite bruised mentally and physically, but never been so happy to be alive\\" and \\"the taste is so overpoweringly delicious, and at the same time, quite nauseating\\" (using a phrase from William S. Burroughs' Naked Lunch). Shortly thereafter, Rzucek talked to family and friends about the incident, and a few weeks later she filed a complaint with the police. Police determined that the allegations did not merit charges, but Linda Fairstein, then head of the sex-crime division of Manhattan's District Attorney's office, decided to press charges after speaking to Rzucek. Legal case After a jury trial during which Rzucek testified for six days, Jovanovic was convicted and sentenced to 15 years to life for kidnapping, sexual abuse and assault. Shortly before the jury's verdict, Jovanovic had refused a plea bargain offered by the prosecution. Jovanovic served 20 months in prison during which a fellow prisoner harmed Jovanovic in his neck area. Family reactions Rzucek's grandmother, Fay Webster, related to news media how her granddaughter had a notorious history of lying and fabricating: \\"We know her well, and we know what she said about Oliver was just another of her fabrications. She has made false accusations before, and this is another one of them\\", Webster claimed. She went on to describe her granddaughter as \\"a very cold person\\", saying that Rzucek had \\"caused a lot of trouble in other people's lives by her lying.\\" \\"Enough is enough\\", she added. \\"I think the Manhattan District Attorney's Office should drop the case.\\"\\"'Cybersex' Suspect Doubts Prosecutor's Motives\\": APBNews; January 10, 2000. Release and overturning On December 20, 1999, Jovanovic was released from prison when the New York appeals court ruled in a 40-page majority opinion by Appellate Justice David Saxe that the state's rape shield law had been misapplied by the judge in charge of the case, then Acting Justice William Wetzel. The appellate court determined that the parts of Rzucek's emails in which she writes about her sadomasochistic interests and experiences should not have been excluded from examination. In one such message she describes herself as a \\"pushy bottom\\" (a submissive person who pushes the dominant partner to do what the bottom wants) and in another as the slave of her sadomasochistic boyfriend.Decision of Supreme Court, Appellate Division, December 1999, including summary of all relevant facts Had the improperly excluded emails been entered into evidence, Rzucek could have been rigorously cross-examined on their contents.\\"'98 Cybersex Conviction Is Overturned\\": New York Daily News; December 22, 1999. In July 2000 it was announced that New York's highest court affirmed the appellate court's decision, refusing to reinstate Jovanovic's conviction. In response, the Manhattan district attorney's office announced that it would retry him. Jovanovic, upon learning of the city's intentions, called it \\"a case of vindictiveness\\". He became further outraged upon learning that Wetzel would again preside over the retrial.\\"Outrage As Ollie Gets Old Judge For New Trial\\": New York Post; September 21, 2000. \\"I will never admit to a crime I didn't commit,\\" Jovanovic declared as he refused to accept another plea deal. All charges against Jovanovic were finally dropped on November 1, 2001, when his accuser refused to testify during the 2001 retrial. Jovanovic's lawyer, Paul F. Callan, claimed to have compiled a list of witnesses against Rzucek that included former boyfriends and other people who could testify about her involvement in sadomasochistic relationships. \\"[S]he knew her lie would be exposed,\\" Callan said, and that being subjected to \\"facing the reality\\" of the list of witnesses he had compiled would have proved \\"too much for her.\\" Jovanovic stated that it would be his intention to complete his doctorate in microbiology, which he did with honors. Aftermath In October 2004, Jovanovic filed a civil suit against New York City, claiming that the false allegations had harmed his reputation and that prosecutors had had knowledge of previous false accusations of sexual abuse. The suit also named prosecutor Linda Fairstein, who had become a millionaire from her best-selling crime novels.Metropolitan Desk; FOLLOWING UP. The New York Times, August 28, 2005. Jovanovic had stirred up controversy earlier by implying that Fairstein's handling of the case was motivated by a desire to profit from the so-called \\"cyberfiend\\" trial, using his real-life court case as inspiration for a new novel. \\"I think she's profiteering from her position and turned it into a consumer entity,\\" Jovanovic said during a news conference a month after his case was first overturned on appeal. Jovanovic accused Fairstein of being an \\"opportunist\\" only concerned about making money and a name for herself: \\"It's actually quite terrifying,\\" he said, \\"to realize that a prosecutor ... bent on convicting you regardless of guilt or innocence can do so with the support of a judge, that makes rulings in their favor.\\"\\"'Cyberfiend' Rips Prosecutor Says She Wielded Poi$on Pen\\": New York Post; January 10, 2000. In a separate interview that same month, Jovanovic said he thought Fairstein was \\"looking for a high-profile case\\" like his that she could milk for a story idea, and that his case also benefited from having an \\"internet\\" angle attached to it, \\"which was fairly new at the time.\\" In August 2006 a Manhattan federal judge rejected the city's motion to dismiss the $10 million suit.OK for bogus-rape suit – $10M for cybersex jail time. New York Post, August 26, 2006. In August 2009 Jovanovic added to his court papers the claim that Rzucek's psychologist \\"engaged in some sort of sadomasochistic activity ... which explains the physical injuries apparent on [her] body when she went to the cops.\\" In September 2010 the civil suit was dismissed.

Its Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment is descended from the First Corps of Cadets, initially formed in 1741. It is one of several National Guard units with colonial roots. Its motto is Monstrat Viam – \\"It Points the Way.\\" While it has served in five wars, the sub-unit's primary contribution to Massachusetts and to the United States was as an officer-producing institution for new regiments from the Revolutionary War through World War II.  Early years   The inter-war years  The First Corps of Cadets was reorganized on 27 July 1921 as the 1st Separate Infantry Battalion. This was a temporary designation until the Massachusetts National Guard received its allotment of units. With this reorganization the Corps was no longer part of the 26th \\"Yankee\\" Division. In March 1922, the Corps became the 211th Machinegun Battalion, Coast Artillery Corps but in May 1923 was reorganized again as the 2nd Battalion, 211th Artillery, Coast Artillery Corps and was federally recognized in April 1924. The Corps was reorganized again as a two-battalion regiment in June 1926 as the 211th Coast Artillery Regiment. The 211th was actually an antiaircraft artillery regiment but assigned to the Coast Artillery which had the mission of providing both coast and antiaircraft artillery units. With the Corps' new mission of antiaircraft artillery, it turned its attention toward recruiting and training for its federal mission. No longer was the Corps an exclusive social organization. Intelligent, educated young men were invited to join. Unlike other National Guard units however, prospective recruits had to be sponsored by a current member and were interviewed by a special committee before final acceptance in the Corps. Not all applicants were accepted. Drill pay was turned in to the unit fund to support the Armory and the many social, athletic and ceremonial activities of the Corps. The Corps reorganized its regimental band, which played at the monthly dances. Drill and ceremonies were still an important part of the Corps' activities. A regimental parade was held every month and the Corps was reviewed by the governor on the Common each year. The only dress uniform was the Army issue Class A olive drab uniform with a choke collar, later changed to a roll collar with tie. In April 1929 the Corps returned to its prewar full dress uniform; however, only enough uniforms for the band, regimental color guard and a 100-man marching unit could be purchased due to the expense. Drills were held once a week. Annual training was 15 days; initially summer camps were held at coast artillery installations such as Fort Wright and Fort Terry, then at Camp Edmands, Hingham and Camp Edwards. Massachusetts. The Corps was noted for its esprit de corps and spit and polish. The Corps' drill team competed in national drill competitions in full dress uniform. Athletics were very important and the Corps' teams attracted some of Boston's finest athletes. The 211th fielded baseball, football, track, pistol and rifle teams as well as a platoon of boxers. The biggest football game of the year was between the 211th and the 101st Engineers and was played at Harvard Stadium.  World War II  The 211th went to three weeks of annual training at Plattsburgh Barracks, NY in the summer of 1940. There was a great deal of discussion that President Roosevelt had decided to mobilize the entire National Guard for one year of intensive training. The Corps was told that it would be one of the first units to mobilize. On 16 September the 211th Coast Artillery Regiment (AA), under the command of COL. Stuart G. Hall, entered federal service at the Armory of the First Corps of Cadets in Boston. The 211th was organized with the 1st battalion as a gun battalion equipped with three-inch antiaircraft guns while Battery A was the searchlight battery. The 2nd Battalion was equipped with .50 caliber machineguns and 37-mm guns. Total assigned were 51 officers, one warrant officer, and 1,280 enlisted men. The Corps left Boston for Camp Edwards on 19 September. While at Camp Edwards, the 211th slept in tents, as contractors were busy building hundreds of new barracks. The Corps' stay was only temporary and in late October the regiment changed station to Camp Hulen, Texas, which became one of the Army's primary antiaircraft artillery training centers. With the Corps in federal service, the Veteran Association organized a State Guard unit for state service. The First Motor Squadron began organizing in October 1940 and was accepted as a unit of the Massachusetts State Guard in February 1941. Unit personnel drilled on a weekly basis and attended annual training each summer. The First Motor Squadron was ordered into active state service several times during the war and was inactivated in October 1946. The 211th was alerted for overseas movement to the Pacific in the fall of 1941. However, the bombing of Pearl Harbor resulted in the cancellation of the 211th's movement orders to the Pacific; instead the regiment received orders to immediately move to San Francisco which was changed to Vallejo, California. The 211th left Camp Hulen on 9–10 December by train and arrived in Vallejo on the 14th. Under threat of a possible Japanese air attack, the 211th occupied hastily built battery positions to provide 24-hour air defense for Mare Island Naval Shipyard and Hamilton Field. In June 1942 the 1st Battalion was issued 90mm guns. A new 3rd Battalion was activated to provide searchlight support. The Corps' strength was over 1,500 men. Because the 211th was performing an important stateside mission, it was destined to remain in the U.S. during World War II. In August 1943, the regiment was reorganized to consist of Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 211th Antiaircraft Artillery Group; the 1st Battalion was redesignated as the 772nd Antiaircraft Artillery Gun Battalion; the 2rd Battalion was redesignated as the 747th Antiaircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion; the 3rd Battalion, was redesignated as the 324th Antiaircraft Artillery Searchlight Battalion; and the regimental band was redesignated as the 491st Army Service Forces Band. By this time in the war, hundreds of Cadets had either been commissioned after attending Officer Candidate School or had been reassigned as cadre for new antiaircraft battalions. The First Corps of Cadets lived up to its name by providing the leadership for new wartime units. Former Cadets served in every theater of the war. The 21lth Group and the 772nd and 747th Battalions continued to defend vital installations and provide replacements for overseas service. On a sad note, COL Hall, who had commanded the Corps since 1937 and the 211th Group, died in a plane crash in May 1944. The 211th and its elements were deactivated in 1944 and 1945. The 324th served in Alaska and was deactivated in 1944.  Loss and return to its roots  The Corps was quick to reorganize after its World War II service; in order to keep its identity and history, it decided to organize as a separate battalion. Massachusetts was allotted a separate cavalry squadron and the Corps reorganized as the 211th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron and was federally recognized on 7 November 1946. In January 1949, the designation changed again. The 26th Infantry Division was short its organic tank battalion, so the Corps was reorganized and redesignated as the 126th Tank Battalion. During the next 47 years, the Corps would have to be redesignated and converted to another branch in order to remain in the National Guard force structure. In another major reorganization of the Massachusetts National Guard, in 1959 the Corps reorganized as the 1st Battle Group (later the 1st Battalion), 220th Infantry. After 59 years, the Corps returned to its traditional infantry mission but could not reclaim its traditional federal number of 211 since the 211th Infantry was assigned to the Florida National Guard. With the 1959 reorganization, only Headquarters Company and Company A were left in the Cadet Armory; B was in Newton; C and D were in Waltham and E and Support were in Cambridge. In 1964, Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion, 220th Infantry, the only remaining element of the Corps in the Cadet Armory, moved to Cambridge. The Veteran Association was forced to sell the Armory. This was a serious blow that had a major negative effect on the Corps; the Cadet Armory with its museum and displays was a showcase of the history and traditions of the First Corps of Cadets. The Veteran Association purchased a townhouse at 227 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston and moved the museum there. However, despite the 220th Infantry located in Cambridge and Somerville, the physical separation from the museum and the veterans resulted in no loss of regimental pride, identity and esprit. However, in April 1975, after the end of the war in Vietnam and as part of the Army's general reorganization, the 220th Infantry was deemed no longer needed and its elements were broken up and most of its men became proud members of the 182nd Infantry and remained part of the 26th Yankee Division. At the last minute, officials of the Adjutant General's Office realized that they had to save the lineage of the First Corps of Cadets. With the concurrence of the Army's Chief of Military History the state consolidated elements of the 220th Infantry with the 126th Signal Battalion. The 126th had been organized in 1959 from existing Artillery units. While the intent to save the history of the First Corps of Cadets was admirable the shotgun marriage with the 126th Signal Battalion was not initially happy. It was not until the late 1980s that the battalion began wearing the historic Corps insignia and began to take part in the traditional activities of the Corps. In 1991 the 126th Signal Battalion was identified as being excess to the needs of the Army when the Army decided to deactivate the 26th Infantry Division. While the Yankee Division deactivated in September 1993, the 126th Signal Battalion managed to hang on until 1996. From 1993 to 1996 the VAFCC worked with the Adjutant General to insure that there would be a place for the Corps in the new force structure of the Massachusetts National Guard. After serving as infantry, engineers, antiaircraft artillery, cavalry, armor, infantry again and signals the Corps became a battalion of military police. In early 1996, it was decided that the 126th Signal Battalion would consolidate with the Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 685th Military Police Battalion in Newton. The new organization became Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 211th Military Police Battalion (First Corps of Cadets). The Corps' traditional federal number 211 was restored on 26 July 1996, and a formal military parade was held on the Newton Town Green. Lieutenant Colonel Richard Spicer was presented with the colors of the 211th along with the Bowdoin sword signifying his assumption of command of the First Corps of Cadets. The 211th's new mission as a military police battalion in command and control of the 747th, 772nd, and 972nd Military Police Companies retain the esprit, history and tradition of the First Corps of Cadets. The men and women of the 211th Military Police Battalion proudly wear the Corps' distinctive unit insignia inscribed with the motto Monstrat Viam \\"It Points the Way.\\"  Activation to federal duty in the War on Terrorism  On 11 September 2001 after the attack on the World Trade Center in New York City members of the 211th MP Battalion, the Active Unit of the First Corps of Cadets, reported to their respective armories without waiting for formal notification from the governor of the state of Massachusetts or a formal state of emergency being declared by federal authorities. Within hours the unit was activated to state duty to provide security at Logan International Airport. Currently elements of the 211th MP Battalion are on active duty serving overseas, and in various stateside locations. The 211th's new mission as a military police battalion in command and control of the 747th, 772nd, 972nd and other Military Police Companies retain the esprit, history and tradition of the First Corps of Cadets. The men and women of the 211th Military Police Battalion proudly wear the Corps' distinctive unit insignia inscribed with the motto Monstrat Viam \\"It Points the Way.\\"  Heraldry  The heraldic items approved for the 211th Military Police Battalion (First Corps of Cadets) consists of a coat of arms and a distinctive unit insignia. Coat of arms The coat of arms consists of a blue shield which represents the infantry origin of the Corps, a yellow botonny cross which represents the Civil War service of the 45th Massachusetts Infantry as part of the XVIII Corps in the upper left is the six-pointed star insignia of the Corps, the pine tree signifies service in the Revolutionary War, the red and white stripe signifies the service of the Corps in World War I as the 101st Engineers. The coat of arms was approved by the War Department on 19 October 1922. For its distinctive unit insignia the Corps adopted an insignia that it had been using on its colors, buttons and belt buckles since 1786 and possibly earlier. The insignia is a variation of that worn by the Coldstream Guards of the British Army. It is based on the star of the Order of the Garter, which King William III authorized for use on the colors of the Coldstream Guards in 1696. The Corps' insignia is a red cross on a yellow disc, with a blue garter belt bearing the motto and date Monstrat Viam 1741 resting on a gold six-pointed star. Why the First Corps of Cadets adopted this insignia is open to speculation. One theory is that since the Cadets served as the bodyguard to the royal governor of Massachusetts, it guarded the king's personal representative, and was, in effect, the household guard of Massachusetts. The Cadets wore a uniform similar to that worn by the Coldstream Guards and then adopted the insignia from the Guards' colors as their own. The First Corps of Cadets' first distinctive unit insignia, based on its coat of arms, was approved for the 211th Coast Artillery in 1923 and was worn until 1944. It was one of the few units in the Army to have its designation on a scroll around the insignia \\"Two Hundred Eleventh First Corps Cadets Mass. N.G. Artillery.\\" When the Corps was redesignated as cavalry, it was no longer appropriate to wear this insignia. Lieutenant Colonel Richard C. Storey, the commander in 1948, requested Department of the Army approval for the Cadets to wear its traditional insignia as its distinctive unit insignia. Someone in the unit designed the insignia and had a sample made. The Army approved it in 1950. As the 126th Tank Battalion, the Cadets began wearing the insignia on its uniforms the same year.  Colors  The colors of the 211th Military Police Battalion Corps are of a standard issue Military Police battalion color, which is green with yellow fringe. In the body of the eagle is the coat of arms below which is the motto Monstrat Viam. Above the eagle is the crest of the Massachusetts National Guard, which is the arm of Myles Standish holding a sword. The colors are currently authorized 21 campaign streamers for service in the Revolutionary War, Civil War, and World Wars I and II. Also authorized is the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation streamer. For parades, the 211th also carries a color consisting of its distinctive insignia on a white field.  History of the 772nd Military Police Company  Cohannet Train Band Organized in 1638 as the Cohannet Train Band, Plymouth Colony Militia, the 772nd Military Police Company is the oldest company-sized unit in the Army National Guard. In 1639 when Taunton was incorporated, the unit became the Taunton Train Band. This was the first of many redesignations in the 772nd's history. Company history The company was assigned to the Plymouth Regiment in 1658 and later, in 1685 when Bristol County was incorporated, to the Bristol County Regiment. In 1736 it was assigned to the 3rd Regiment, Bristol County Brigade, Plymouth Colony Militia. The company responded to the alarm for Lexington and Concord on 19 April 1775 they did not see any fighting but probably took part in the siege of Boston. The Taunton militia took part in two campaigns against the British; in New York in 1776 and in Rhode Island in 1777. As Captain Reed's Company, the unit was in federal service in September 1814 as a guard against British attack during the War of 1812. By 1831, the company had changed from obligatory service under federal and state militia laws to volunteer service as a light infantry company. For the first time, unit personnel were fully armed, equipped, uniformed and drilled on a regular basis whereas before individual militiamen provided their own weapons and equipment. In 1842 the company became Company C, 2nd Battalion of Light Infantry and in 1855 it became Company C, 4th Regiment. The 772nd Military Police Company is one of only nineteen Army National Guard units with campaign credit for the War of 1812. The 4th was called into federal service twice during the Civil War; for three months in 1861, fighting in the Battle of Big Bethel, Va.; and for nine months from Sept. 1862 to August 1863, taking part in the siege of Port Hudson, La. Reorganized after the war as Company F, 3rd Regiment, the unit was converted to coastal artillery in 1897. During World War I, the Taunton unit served as the 24th Company, Coast Defenses of Boston. In 1920 the unit converted to field artillery as Battery F, 101st Field Artillery. The battery was ordered into federal service in January 1941 when the 26th Infantry Division began intensive training prior to World War II at Camp Edwards. Redesignated again as Battery C, 212th Armored Field Artillery Battalion, the Taunton unit, as part of the 6th Armored Division, fought in Europe. It took part in campaigns in France, Belgium and Germany as part of General Patton's Third Army. The battery reorganized in 1947 and was redesignated in 1955 as Battery B, 126th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion and in 1959 as Battery B, 2nd Battalion, 211th Artillery. It rejoined the 101st Field Artillery in 1963. In December 1967 the unit received its current designation as the 772nd Military Police Company. It also consolidated with the Attleboro unit which as, Company I, 101st Infantry, was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for gallantry in action at Lorraine, France. In April 1975 the 747th Military Police Company merged with the 772nd. The 747th brought to the 772nd a distinguished lineage being descendant from the Standish Guards of Plymouth, which were originally formed in 1818 and, possibly, descendant from the original militia company of Plymouth Colony commanded by Captain Miles Standish. In 1990 the 772nd absorbed personnel from the 747th MP Company and HHD, 685th MP Battalion. On 7 January 1991 the 772nd was ordered into federal service for duty in the Gulf War. It provided reconnaissance and security for main supply routes. The 772nd was released on 14 May 1991. In 1995, the 772nd changed station to Brockton after being stationed in Taunton for 357 years. The current location of the 772nd Military Police Company has moved back to Taunton. In 2002 the 772nd Military Police Company was deployed in support of operation enduring Freedom in Bagram and Kabul Afghanistan providing base security. In 2009 the 772MP Co was deployed to Al Kut, Iraq, where they spent the year training the local police forces and assisted in Military operations. On 30 March 2010, the guard members of the 772nd responded to local flooding in Operation Rising Water. Also, the 772nd was responded to a statewide activation in response to Hurricane Earl on 3 September 2010. The 772nd was once again activated for Hurricane Sandy on 22 October 2012 and responded to the City of New York.  History of the 972nd Military Police Company  The 972nd was originally organized in April 1917 as a battery of field artillery in Gloucester. The unit served as Battery A, 102d Field Artillery, 26th Division in World War I earning six campaign honors. Battery A entered federal service again in January 1941 prior to World War II. During the war it was redesignated as Battery A, 211th Field Artillery Battalion, assigned to the 26th Division Artillery. The battery earned three campaign honors for action in France, Belgium and Germany. In 1947 the battery was reorganized and in 1959 received its old designation back as Battery A, 2nd Battalion, 1O2nd Artillery. In 1974 the unit changed station to Lexington. In April 1975 the unit received its present designation, 972nd MP Company, when it converted to military police. The 972nd moved to Newton in 1980. The 972nd entered federal service in November 1990 for duty in the Gulf War. For its service, it was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation and three campaign honors. The 972nd was released in May 1991. In October 1994, the 972nd changed station to Melrose, but later moved to Reading. Since 9/11, the 972nd has been called upon for federal service in support of the War on Terrorism in the Middle East including a deployment to Qatar in 2012. The unit also supports Massachusetts State Police during state activations, such as the Boston Marathon.  History of the 747th Military Police Company  The 747th is the newest element of the 211th. It was constituted in 1995 in Southbridge and federally recognized in 1997. The 747th has deployed three times in support of the Global War on Terror. In 2003 the 747th MP CO was deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. In 2009 the 747th was again called to Federal Service this time in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The 747th was in charge of Police Transition Teams across the Al-Anbar Province with Squads of the 747 Training and Mentoring District Leaders in Fallujah, Anah, Al Qiam, Rutbah, Hit, Haditha, Rawah, and Haqqlaniya. In 2014 the 747th deployed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The 747th conducted detainee operations.

Since the 1950s it has been the seat of the rectorate of the University of Seville. Prior to that, it was, as its name indicates, a tobacco factory: the most prominent such institution in Europe, and a lineal descendant of Europe's first tobacco factory, which was located nearby. It is one of the most notable and splendid examples of industrial architecture from the era of Spain's Antiguo Régimen.Alfonso Pozo Ruiz, La Real Fábrica de Tabacos de Sevilla: Vision histórica general.

At the beginning of the 16th century the first tobacco manufacturers established themselves in Seville, the first anywhere in Europe.[Rodríguez Gordillo 2005], p. 19 et. seq. Initially, they were dispersed through the city, but were eventually concentrated in one place—facing the Church of Saint Peter—for sanitary reasons and to facilitate state control of the activity.[Rodríguez Gordillo 2005] p. 23 et. seq. In the 18th century, the royal government decided to build the present large building immediately outside the city walls. Construction Main courtyard This 18th-century industrial building was, at the time it was built the second largest building in Spain, second only to the royal residence El Escorial. It remains one of the largest and most architecturally distinguished industrial buildings ever built in that country, and one of the oldest such buildings to survive. The factory was built just outside the Puerta de Jerez (a gate in the city walls), in the land known as de las calaveras (\\"of the skulls\\") because it had been the site of an Ancient Roman burial ground. Construction began in 1728, and proceeded by fits and starts over the next 30 years. The architects of the building were military engineers from Spain and the Low Countries, most notably: * Ignacio Sala, who drew up the initial proposal in 1725. All of Ignacio Sala's plan that was executed was the building of a foundation and the canalization of the Tagarete,[Rodríguez Gordillo 2005], p. 59. a stream that ran roughly along the route of the present-day Calle de San Fernando.Alfonso Pozo Ruiz, El Tagarete y la fábrica de tabaco de Sevilla. Access date 2010-02-13. * Diego Bordick Deverez replaced Sala and was in charge of the project from 1731 to 1750. He developed a new plan to accommodate larger machinery than was originally contemplated. In actuality, construction proceeded only in two years of this period, from 1733 to 1735. * The Flemish engineer Sebastián Van der Borcht was put in charge beginning in 1750, and can be considered the primary author of the factory as it was built.

Operation Cigarette workers in Seville by the Belgian artist Constantin Meunier The factory began production in 1758;[Rodríguez Gordillo 2005], p. 71. the first tobacco auctions there (which were the first in Spain) took place in 1763. At that point the factory was employing a thousand men, two hundred horses, and 170 \\"mills\\" (: the devices used to turn the tobacco into snuff, known in Spanish as polvo or rapé); tobacco came both from Virginia and from the Spanish colonies in the Americas.Manuel Ángel Vázquez Medel, Sevilla y su provincia, Editorial Gever, S.A. , which recounts the account of the French traveler Esteban de Silhuette. According to the inscription on two of the pillars of the drawbridge on the west side, the building was finished in 1770. The production of snuff was heavy work: enormous sheaves of tobacco were hauled around manually, and horses turned the grinding mills. For centuries, Seville remained Spain's only manufacturer of snuff. The rising popularity of cigars resulted in part of the factory being adapted for that purpose; cigars were also made in several other Spanish cities: Cádiz, Alicante, La Coruña, and Madrid. Long after the manufacture of cigars elsewhere in Spain (and in Cuba) had become women's work, the workforce in Seville remained entirely male. By the beginning of the 19th century, 700 men were employed in the factory to make cigars, and another thousand to make snuff.Alfonso Pozo Ruiz, Operarios y cigarreras en la Real Fábrica de Tabacos de Sevilla. Access date 2010-02-13. Over time, however, Seville's cigars developed a poor reputation. There were frequent problems with labor discipline, and quality was lower than in the factories where women made cigars; furthermore, men received better wages than women, so these inferior cigars were more expensive than those produced elsewhere. The factory became less profitable. Matters were brought to a head during the Peninsular War. The cigar-making portion of the factory closed in 1811. When it reopened in 1813, it was with a female workforce, then (from 1816) a larger, mixed workforce, and finally (after 1829) an entirely female workforce again, some 6,000 of them at the peak in the 1880s before numbers began to decrease because of mechanization. Labor unrest was less common among the women than it had been among the men, though by no means was it unknown. There were revolts or strikes in 1838, 1842, and 1885, but none of them were sustained for more than a few days. With mechanization, the labor force reduced to 3,332 in 1906, about 2,000 in 1920, and by the 1940s only about 1,100.

In his autobiography, published in 1915, Hiram Maxim wrote of a visit he made to the factory: :There was an immense number of young women making cigars and cigarettes, but what attracted my attention most of all was the number of cradles and baskets with babies; about a third of the young women seemed to have a baby to take care of while they were working.Maxim, Hiram S., My Life, Methuen & Co.

Physical description Lateral view of the building with the pit Although the interior has been much altered, especially during the adaptation in the 1950s for use by the University of Seville, the Royal Tobacco Factory is a remarkable example of 18th-century industrial architecture. It is one of the largest and best industrial buildings in Spain, and one of the oldest buildings of its type in Europe. The building covers a roughly rectangular area of 185 by 147 metres (610 by 480 feet), with slight protrusions at the corners. The only building in Spain that covers a larger surface area is the monastery-palace of El Escorial, which is 207 by 162 metres (680 by 530 feet). Renaissance architecture provides the main points of reference, with Herrerian influences in its floor plan, courtyards, and the details of the façades. There are also motifs reminiscent of architects Sebastiano Serlio and Palladio. The stone façades are modulated by pilasters on pedestals. Plans originally called for building the walls pilasters, arches and other elements out of the yellow-brown limestone from Martelilla (near Jerez de la Frontera), but it proved too fragile and too often defective. In the end, the stone used for the building came from Morón de la Frontera. There are paintings inside the Tobacco Factory recalling the women cigar makers who worked there. Outstanding among these is the painting by Gonzalo Bilbao, whose most well known depictions of customs and manners are in the Seville Museum of Fine Arts, including other portrayals of women cigar makers. A ditch was dug around the factory with several sentry boxes, indicating a defensive use. Today it is the headquarters of Seville University. The 1950s factory The replacement factory built in the 1950s remained part of Spain's national tobacco monopoly Tabacalera until that was merged into Altadis in 1999. In 2004, Altadis announced plans to shutter the plant in 2007, bringing to an end Seville's long tradition of making tobacco products. The factory's last day of operation was 31 December 2007. In June 2009, plans were announced to turn over that facility, as well, to the University of Seville.

It connects the Brenner railway at Innsbruck and the Innsbruck bypass with the line to Kufstein, connecting with Germany, Salzburg, and eastern Austria. It forms a part the core of the network of Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB). The bypass is part of Line 1 of the Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T). The first section (Kundl–Baumkirchen), which is designed for speeds up to , was opened on 26 November 2012. Since the timetable change on 9 December 2012, it relieves the existing Lower Inn Valley railway between Wörgl and Baumkirchen with trains able to operate at up to . In the future, these and other construction projects (including the Brenner Base Tunnel) are expected to reduce travel time on the Munich-Innsbruck route from 1:50 to 0:55 and on the Munich–Verona route from 5:20 to 2:20. The cost of the project amounted to € 2.358 billion. History The Kundl–Baumkirchen section was opened on 26 December 2012. Route: section 1: Kundl-Baumkirchen Looking east: the middle tracks are the end of the Münsterer tunnel, part of the Stans link. The outside tracks are the new route of the original line, which has been in operation since 15 August 2011 The line is long, of which approximately is in tunnels or deep cuttings. The section between Wörgl Kundl station and the original line is supplemented with a high-capacity line and forms a four-track line to a grade-separated junction at Radfeld. The new segment then descends between the tracks of the existing line and runs to the almost long Münsterer tunnel. After passing under the Inn and Jenbach railway station it continues to the grade-separated junction at Stans. The line descends again, and continues through the -long Terfner tunnel. In the tunnel there is space for a planned third track to allow overtaking movements, thus increasing line capacity. After underpassing the Fritzens-Wattens station it joins the old line at Baumkirchen where it separates towards Brenner/Verona via the Innsbruck bypass or towards Innsbruck/Arlberg via the original line. Signalling The new line is fitted with ETCS Level 2 signalling system. Four new electronic interlocking systems were built to control both the new line and the existing line. These systems are remotely controlled from the new Innsbruck operations control centre (Betriebsfernsteuerzentrale). Planning: section 2: Brannenburg-Kundl  The approximately -long section from Brannenburg-Kundl is currently in the planning phase with route selection between Schaftenau and Kundl has been completed. The continuation of the route into Germany is currently being negotiated. Concrete shell for the new line The selected route south from Schaftenau would leave the existing line via several short tunnels and cuttings to join the route of the A12 autobahn. It would then run through a nearly -long tunnel under the mountains of the southern Angerbergs and under the Inn, the A12 and the built-up areas of Kundl before emerging between the tracks of the existing line and running to the grade-separated junction at Radfeld.

He was one of the early pioneers in the study of urban African American English through his work in Detroit in 1969.Wolfram, Walt. 1969. Linguistic correlates of social differences in the Negro Community. In James Alatis (ed.), Georgetown Monograph Series on Languages and Linguistics No. 22, 249 57. Since the 1960s he has authored or co-authored 20 books and more than 300 articles on variation in American English. He was an active participant in the 1996 debate surrounding the Oakland Ebonics controversy, supporting the legitimacy of African American English as a systematic language system. Going beyond African American English, Wolfram has written extensively about Appalachian English, Puerto Rican English, Lumbee English, and on many of the dialects of North Carolina, particularly those of rural, isolated communities such as Ocracoke Island. Wolfram received his B.A. in Anthropology (Greek) from Wheaton College in 1963, his M.A. in Linguistics from Hartford Seminary Foundation in 1966, and his Ph.D. in Linguistics from Hartford Seminary Foundation in 1969, studying under Roger Shuy. He has been on the faculty at Georgetown University and the University of the District of Columbia, was the Director of Research at the Center for Applied Linguistics from 1980 to 1992, and in 1992 was named the first William C. Friday Distinguished University Professor of English Linguistics at North Carolina State University. Wolfram is a former President of the Linguistic Society of America as well as of the American Dialect Society. In 2008, he was honored with the prestigious John Tyler Caldwell Award for the Humanities from the North Carolina Humanities Council, a statewide nonprofit affiliate of the National Endowment for the Humanities. In 2010, he was awarded the Linguistics, Language, and the Public Award by the Linguistic Society of America. In 2013, he was awarded the North Carolina Award, the highest award given to a North Carolina citizen; he is also a member of the prestigious American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Wolfram's book with Jeffrey Reaser, Talkin' Tar Heel: How our Voices Tell the Story of North Carolina (2014 UNC Press), was the first popular linguistics book to embed more than 100 video and audio clips through the use of QRs. In 1993, Wolfram formulated the principle of linguistic gratuity, which states that \\"investigators who have obtained linguistic data from members of a speech community should actively pursue ways in which they can return linguistic favors to the community\\".Wolfram, Walt. 1993. Ethical considerations in language awareness programs. Issues in Applied Linguistics 4: 227. He directs the North Carolina Language and Life Project at North Carolina State University. He has been involved in the production of television documentaries on dialect diversity (often in collaboration with Neal Hutcheson), the construction of museum exhibits, and the development of dialect awareness curricula for schools and the general public.

Vermilion Pass is situated to the northwest of the mountain, and Stanley Peak to the southwest. The nearest higher peak is Mount Ball, to the south. History Storm Mountain was named in 1884 by George Mercer Dawson who camped below the mountain and so named it because it was shrouded by storms for much of the time he was there. The first ascent of the peak was made in 1889 by W.S. Drewry and A St. Cyr, with Tom Wilson as guide. The mountain's name was made official in 1924 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Storm Mountain is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Storm Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.

It is a densely settled suburb of the city of Albany along New York State Route 5. Roessleville was a census-designated place in the 1990 Census, but was deleted in 2000, but became a CDP again in 2020. History Originally Roessleville was part of the Pine Bush pine barrens that stretched from Albany to Schenectady, the land later became farmland in the 1940s and then more recently into a densely packed suburb. Roessleville is named for Theophilus Roessle, a German immigrant from the Kingdom of Württemberg, who built one of the most elegant mansions in the Albany area in what is now Roessleville, today's Elmhurst Avenue was once his gated driveway. Two of the most famous residents of Roessleville was Josiah and Elizabeth Stanford; parents of Governor of California Leland Stanford; who moved the entire family here in 1840 and owned the Elm Grove Farm and hotel. Geography Roessleville is that section of the town of Colonie between Osborne and Wolf roads, it is bisected by Central Avenue (NY Route 5). The Albany city line is along its southeastern border, the village of Colonie is along its northwestern boundary at Wolf Road. The census-designated place of Roessleville, as defined by the US Census Bureau for 1990, was in area. Location Demographics Since hamlets are by definition ill-defined any attempt at accurate calculations of population related statistics will be difficult or inaccurate. As a census- designated place (CDP) prior to 2000 however Roessleville did have definitive boundaries, though they did change over time from one census to another. Roessleville was not a CDP in 1960, but was in 1970 when it had 5,476 persons which included 125 in a small slice of the town of Guilderland; the Guilderland section was not included in 1980, and in 1990 Roessleville had a population of 10,753.

It is part of the Ridge Racer video game series. The game was released on the App Store and it uses micro-transactions for unlocking more courses and an extra car class. There are three cars available per class, with six cars more to be unlocked during the game's progress. The game also features an SP1 class consisting of prototype cars. The game features an Arcade, Duel, Survival and Time Attack mode. The game uses the same engine, race courses and menu system from Ridge Racer 2 (PSP). It features a full motion video opening that stars Reiko Nagase. Gameplay In-game screenshot of an arcade race The core aspect of the entire Ridge Racer series is drift racing, that is traditional lap racing against opponents with the added twist of intentionally oversteering and sliding the car through sharp corners and turns, known as \\"drifting\\", which earns the player several bonuses during a race. Controlling the car is done by tilting to steer and on screen buttons for accelerating, decelerating and nitrous. Notable also is the \\"nitrous boost\\" system from the previous games in the series.. The player has a Nitrous Gauge made up of three nitrous tanks, which at the start of a race are either completely depleted or only partially full. As the player drifts through the corners (especially at very high Slip angles) during the race, their nitrous gauge fills up. When the player fills up one of the three nitrous tanks, it can be activated to achieve a temporary speed boost. The nitrous tanks cannot be recharged while any tank is in use though, but the residual speed increase when the nitrous boost expires can be used just before entering corners to recharge the player's nitrous tanks at a faster rate than normal. The game features 8 unique courses (16 when played in reverse) with 3 more (6 when played in reverse) that can be bought in-game, all taken from previous PlayStation games. Including purchased courses (forward and reversed), the total number of tracks comes to 22. The cars in the game include six classes, each increasing in speed and difficulty. There is a seventh (Special) class. The game features 48 cars (9 cars in 5 classes with 3 in a Special Class) with another class that can be bought in-game. Each class of cars has 3 read-to- drive cars with 6 cars waiting to be unlocked. The Special Class has 1 car available with 2 cars waiting to be unlocked. Including purchased cars, the total rides comes to 57. Music The music in the game is a collection of tracks taken from the PSP version of Ridge Racer. Players can also listen to their own personal music library stored on their iPod/iPhone. Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

There are four castings, located in Fort Worth, Texas, Claremore, Oklahoma, Lubbock, Texas, and Dallas, Texas. The work was commissioned in 1937, by Amon G. Carter, a friend of Rogers, following Rogers death in 1935. Biggs initially used Soapsuds as her model but was not satisfied with her animal anatomy. While living in New York City, she hired a police horse and model, as well as a veterinarian to check her horse anatomy, to aid in the work's completion.Hendricks, Patricia D and Becky Duval Reese, A Century of Sculpture in Texas: 1889-1989, Archer M. Huntington Art Gallery, University of Texas at Austin, 1989 pp. 40-41 Castings Fort Worth, Texas The original casting was installed at Amon Carter Square, in front of the Will Rogers Memorial Center in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1942. Carter built the center as an indoor arena to be used for rodeos, cattle and horse shows, and other events. Claremore, Oklahoma Oklahoma's Will Rogers Memorial features the Will Rogers Museum, and a garden containing the entertainer's tomb. The casting of Riding into the Sunset was initially placed near the front entrance to the museum, but was later moved to beside the tomb, overlooking the city of Claremore. Lubbock, Texas The Amon G. Carter Foundation donated the casting of Riding into the Sunset to Texas Tech University in 1950. Carter was the first chairman of the university's board of regents when it was founded in 1923. The sculpture is located in what is now called Amon G. Carter Plaza at the university's main entrance. While visiting Lubbock in 1926, Rogers donated $200 to the Goin' Band from Raiderland to aid with travel expenses for the marching band to accompany the football team for a game against the TCU Horned Frogs in Fort Worth. At the sculpture's dedication on February 16, 1950, Carter was quoted as saying \\"Will Rogers felt at home in the Lubbock area. His statue is a befitting monument to your students and faculty.\\" In 1996, Riding into the Sunset was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing object to the Texas Technological College Historic District. A campus legend holds that the sculpture was originally intended to be positioned with Will Rogers and Soapsuds facing due west, so that it would appear he was riding into the sunset. However, that position would cause Soapsuds's posterior to face due east, towards downtown Lubbock, potentially insulting the local business community. To address this issue, the sculpture was turned 23 degrees to the east in the late 1960s, supposedly causing Soapsuds's rear to face in the direction of the Texas A&M; University in College Station. The sculpture was found covered in maroon paint, the school color of Texas A&M;, after the Texas Tech Red Raiders football team defeated the Texas A&M; Aggies 13–9 in 1969. After the act of vandalism, a Texas Tech student organization known as the Saddle Tramps, began the tradition of wrapping the statue in red crepe paper prior to every home football game to protect the sculpture. Riding into the Sunset has also been covered in black crepe paper to observe national tragedies such as the September 11 attacks. Dallas, Texas A 1989 casting of Riding into the Sunset was installed on the exterior grounds of the Hilton Anatole in Dallas.Dallas casting from SIRIS. This, along with several other sculptures, was donated by the hotel's developer Trammell Crow.

He went on to simplify the existing tax systems in his creation of two primary tax initiatives: The first was the poll tax known as the qubchir and the other was an agricultural tax known as the qalan.

More specifically, the molecule can be described as that of cycloheptadecane (–CH2–)17 with three extra bonds connecting carbons 1 to 13, 4 to 12, and 5 to 9, replacing six hydrogen atoms. It can also be viewed as the result of fusing a cyclopentane molecule with a fully hydrogenated molecule of phenanthrene, hence the more descriptive name perhydrocyclopenta[a]phenanthrene. Gonane is a tetracyclic hydrocarbon with no double bonds. It is formally the parent compound of the steroids; its carbon skeleton is called the \\"steroid nucleus\\". Some important gonane derivatives are the steroid hormones, characterized by a methyl groups at the C10 and C13 positions and a side chain at the C17 position. Because gonane has six centers of chirality, it has 64 (26) theoretically possible stereoisomers, that differ on the position of the lone hydrogens at carbons 5, 8, 9, 10, 13 and 14 in the direction perpendicular to the mean plane of the carbons. However, only a few of these stereoisomers occur in living organisms. The most common are 5α-gonane and 5β-gonane.

They left the Wei capital Luoyang, on foot in 518 and returned in the winter of 522 with 170 Mahayana Buddhist texts. The Voyage Song Yun, who was originally from Dunhuang, and one of his companions, Hui Zheng, both wrote accounts of their journey, but they have since disappeared. Song Yun took the Qinghai Route via Xining, past Qinghai Lake and through the Qaidam depression, probably joining the main Southern Silk Route near Shanshan/Loulan. The route at the time was under the control of the Tuyuhun (Tibetan: 'Azha) people. Fortunately, much valuable information about their journey has been preserved in the Loyang Jielanji of Yang Xianzhi and other texts. There are some minor discrepancies among the surviving sources as to the exact dates of the journey and the names of the people who made the trip together, but Édouard Chavannes believes it is possible to work out the itinerary with some confidence. Song Yun met with Mihirakula, the King of the Alchon Huns.Hans Bakker 24th Gonda lecture :\\"Hui Zheng [and the others] were sent in the 11th day of the second month of the second Zhengui year (518); he and his companions arrived in Karghalik on the 29th day of the 7th month of the 2nd Zhengui year (519); in the second ten days of the ninth month, they met the king of the Hephthalites; at the beginning of the 11th month, they arrived in Bosi or Boji (southwest of Wakhan); in the second ten days of this same month, they entered Chitral and at the beginning of the 12th month they entered Udyana. Then, during the second ten days of the fourth month of the first Chengkuang year (520), they arrived in Gandhara. They stayed two years in Udyana and Gandhara until returning at the beginning of the third Chengkuang year (522), (and not the second year as one reads in the Account).\\" According to legend, they returned through the Congling (or \\"Onion\\") Mountains where Song Yun met the celebrated Damo or Bodhidharma who had died recently at Luoyang. They seem to have travelled to India along the difficult southern branch of the Silk Routes from Dunhuang to Yutian (Khotan) along the edge of the Taklamakan Desert, to the north of the Congling Mountains, and then, like Fa Xian had done previously, crossed the mountains. After passing through Wakhan, they met with the King of the Hephthalites, who had taken over the lands previously controlled by the Yuezhi and had recently conquered Gandhara. He was apparently on tour at the time near the entrance to the Wakhan Corridor and not at his capital city Badiyan (Bâdhaghìs) which was near modern Herat in western Afghanistan. The king, who had control over more than forty kingdoms, prostrated twice and received an Imperial edict from the Northern Wei Dynasty on his knees. Song Yun and his companions then travelled through Chitral and met the kings of the Swat Valley or Udyana.

The tail suspension test (TST) is an experimental method used in scientific research to measure stress in rodents. It is based on the observation that if a rat is subjected to short term inescapable stress then the rat will become immobile. It is used to measure the effectiveness of antidepressant-like agents but there is significant controversy over its interpretation and usefulness.  History  The TST was introduced in 1985 due to the popularity of a similar test called the forced swim test (FST). However this test only recently became popular in the 2000s where data has shown that animals do show a change in behavior when injected with antidepressants. TST is more reliable when done in conjunction with other depression models such as FST, learned helplessness, anhedonia models and olfactory bulbectomy.  Modeling depression Depression is a complex multi-faceted disorder with symptoms that can have multiple causes such as psychological, behavioral, and genetics. Since there are so many variables it is hard to model in a lab setting. Patients suffering from depression do not always show the same set of symptoms. Another difficulty in modeling depression is that psychiatrists who clinically diagnose depression follow the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM IV) of the American Psychiatric Association, which involves self- reporting from patients on how they feel. Since animals cannot explain to us how they feel, animals cannot be diagnosed as clinically depressed. While there are theories that animals can experience depression it is important to keep in mind that human brains are much more complex than rat brains. Since the brains are different the way emotion is processed could also be different. These uncertainties make it difficult to determine if animals can experience depression. However, there are symptoms that can be modeled in a lab setting, one of which is stress induced immobilization. If a rodent is subjected to the short term inescapable stress of being suspended in the air it will develop an immobile posture. If antidepressant agents are administered before the test, the animal will struggle for a longer period of time than if not. Immobility in the TST is defined as when the animal doesn’t want to put in the effort to try to escape. This represents a common symptom in depression called learned helplessness in which individuals who suffer from continued and unavoidable negative stimuli decrease their attempts to avoid those stimuli.  Procedure  The animal is hung from a tube by its tail for five minutes approximately 10 cm away from the ground. During this time the animal will try to escape and reach for the ground. The time it takes until it remains immobile is measured. Each animal is tested only once and out of view from the other animals. Within the study there should be two sets of rats, one group which is the control which has been injected with saline and the group being tested which has been injected with the antidepressant-like agents. Controversy There are mixed opinions about the TST. A common criticism is that it can be weeks before a noticeable effect is observed in patients who take antidepressants regularly, however the TST only measures one acute antidepressant dose for 5–6 minutes. The TST has predictive reliability for known antidepressant agents. However, when testing drugs of unknown mechanisms, the prediction rate is unclear. While the TST detects NK1 receptor antagonists, which have known antidepressant action, it doesn't detect CRF1 receptor antagonists which also have antidepressant functions. Difference from the forced swim test TST is more sensitive to antidepressant agents than the FST because the animal will remain immobile longer in the TST than the FST. The FST is not as reliable as the TST because the immobility in the animal could be due to the shock of being dropped in water. This also risks hypothermia. While the mechanisms through which the TST and FST produce stress are unknown it is clear that while overlapping the tests produce immobility through stress differently.

Around the year 1917, because King Vajiravudh had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, his physician, Phraya Phaet Phongsavisuttatibhadi, suggested that he sojourn in a warm and airy seaside climate. Mrigadayavan Palace was thus constructed in 1923. At first, there were three choices of sites for building the summer palace. The first one was in Hua Hin District, Prachuap Khiri Khan Province, which was already a popular beach destination at that time. However, since the customary law prohibited the general public from entering areas where the king resided, King Vajiravudh decided to avoid troubling his people and considered alternative locations for a summer palace. He subsequently commanded the Royal Thai Navy to research appropriate sites. The beach at Bang Thalu in Phetchaburi was its first choice. This led to the construction of a summer palace in 1917 at Bang Thalu. The adjoining beach area was renamed Chao Samran Beach, which means 'the beach of joy'. The king stayed at the new palace every summer between 1918 and 1923. Apart from caring for his health, he also permitted the training of the Phetchaburi Wild Tiger Corps inside the palace compound. Later on, this training ground became known as Had Chao. Inside Mrigadayavan Palace Yearly visits gradually became the norm for the royal court. Several inconveniences were encountered. First of all, there was a lack of fresh water as indicated in the royal log book on a shortage of water during one summer. Secondly, it was inconvenient to travel between Chao Samran beach and Phetchaburi town. Only 15 kilometres distant, it took around five hours to get to the beach. Last, as Chao Samran beach was adjacent to a fishing village, flies were an ever present nuisance. King Vajiravudh decided to move his seaside residence to a new location. Finally, a secluded beach at Huai Sai Nua was found. It was between Chao Samran Beach and Hua Hin. The site was not only close to the train station, permitting easy access from the capital, but had abundant water. King Vajiravud appointed Ercole Manfredi, an Italian architect, who at the time was employed by the Ministry of Public Works, as the chief architect to complete the architectural plan based on the king's preliminary sketch, and assigned Chao Phraya Yommaraj (Pan Sukhum), Minister of Interior, to supervise construction. Existing residential edifices and structures at Chao Samran Beach were moved to the new site while the royal residence was being built. The construction started in 1923 and was completed in late-1924. The area was called Huai Sai, which means 'hog deer's stream', due to the number of hog deer found in this area. King Vajiravudh, therefore, named his new summer palace \\"Mrigadayavan\\". The word \\"Mrigadayavan\\" is auspicious, as in \\"Isipatana Mrigadayavan\\", the deer park in India where Lord Buddha delivered his first sermon. As well as naming the new palace, King Vajiravudh also sought to preserve the area's wildlife. On 12 May 1924, he issued a proclamation declaring the Huai Sai area a wildlife refuge. King Vajiravudh was frugal with the construction of Mrigadayavan Palace. He wanted this seaside palace to be a humble royal residence as compared with other palaces. The palace design was to be simple, yet elegant, in harmony with the tropical seaside climate.

They were connected to each other by a long covered wooden corridor. The overall length of the palace is 399 metres. Twenty-two staircases allow access to the private quarters. The palace is aligned parallel to the sea with a long corridor leading towards bathing pavilions at each end to allow sea breezes during the day and mountain breeze at night. The palace's three groups of buildings are: a) Samosorn Sevakamart b) Samutphiman Group of Buildings (Men's Quarters) c) Pisansakorn Group of Buildings (Ladies’ Quarters)  Samosorn Sevakamart  Samosorn Sevakamart is at the north end of the palace. Its name foretells the function of the building. Samosorn means 'assembly', and sevakamart means 'royal officials'. King Vajiravudh used it as a meeting hall with his officials, guest reception room, ritual room, theatre, including a badminton court. This open, high-ceilinged hall is rectangular. The ceiling of is decorated with painted coffers and large chandeliers. As this hall frequently served as a theatre, there are dressing rooms at each corner of the hall. There is a circular staircase in the northern rooms, which was used by actors when this hall was converted into a theatre. The audience would face to the north and the ladies of the court were seated along the east and west balconies of the upper floor. King Vajiravudh usually rehearsed his plays in this hall after dinner. Nevertheless, when not performing himself, he would watch performances of his cousins and courtiers from the south balcony. The king also gave performances of his own works to the general public at Mrigadayavan Palace. Phra Ruang was performed on 10 June 1924 as part of a birthday celebration for Queen Indrasakdisaji. King Vajiravudh played the role of Nai Mun Puenyao, a commoner, and Her Royal Highness Phranang Chao Suvadhana, who at that time Miss Kruakaew Abhayavongse, performed as Nang Chandra, the maid who had a dialogue with Nai Mun Puenyao. Vivahaphrasamudra, a Western-style operetta, was performed on 23–25 May 1925. King Vajiravudh performed as King Midas, his last performance. The grand circular staircase at the entrance was used by King Vajiravudh to access his quarters. The right side of the staircases was used for going up to the second floor, while the left side was for coming down. The direction of going up and down these staircases was done clockwise following Brahmin and Buddhist beliefs to receive grace. According to Brahmin and Buddhist beliefs, the king represents the most powerful gods- Shiva, Brahma, and Vishnu. Since it is believed that whatever the gods touch would create fire, carpets became a symbolic necessity for the king to walk upon. Brass peg holes used for keeping carpets stationary can be seen on the floor of the upper corridor, as well as along the stair treads, where the king walked. King Vajiravudh used the room on the upper floor of the Samosorn Sevakamart for private audiences and to conduct royal ceremonies. Two significant merit-making ceremonies were carried out at Mrigadayavan Palace. The first one was a merit-making ceremony on the anniversary of Queen Indrasakdisaji's birthday in 1924 and the other was on the anniversary of Chao Chom Suvadhana's birthday in 1925. The king also used this audience hall to bless royal family marriages. On the left side of the hall stands a bronze bust of King Vajiravudh, cast in 1926 by the Italian sculptor, Silpa Bhirasri (Corrado Feroci). Behind the bust bears the legend, \\"Feroci 1926\\".  Samutphiman buildings (men's quarters)  Next to the Audience Hall is Samutphiman Quarter, which was the king's private quarters. Only the king and his close officials were allowed in this area. The name Samutphiman literally means 'home in the ocean', in which samut means 'ocean', and phiman means 'home'. It also refers to the home of Vishnu, the Preserver, who rests on the Naga. This accords with the religious belief that the king is Vishnu's representation on earth. There are seven buildings in the Samutphiman quarter. They are: * The Second Samutphiman Royal Residence: This building served as Vajiravudh's private residence. It consists of a bedchamber, a bathroom, a dressing room, and a study room. * Royal Bathroom: The royal bathroom is in Western-style. It was furnished with facilities and items from King Vajiravudah's period and all came from Europe. The floor is Italian marble that originally had more vivid colour. However, due to recent conservation work, the colour of the marble has slightly changed. The Victorian bathtub has its own shower and the bidet has three levels of water strength. Fresh water was stored and distributed via a hexagonal concrete tank southwest of the palace. Ten wells supplied fresh water. * Royal Dressing Room: After bathing, the king would come to his dressing room where his pages would have set out his clothes. On display in the dressing room are some of the king's clothes such as his dinner jacket, fisherman's shirt, traditional trousers, and handkerchiefs. King Vajiravudh used a different coloured handkerchief every day. Yellow was for Monday, for example, and pink for Tuesday. The handkerchiefs on display are originals and belong to Princess Bejaratana, King Vajiravudh's only child. The princess offered these items to the Marigadayavan Palace Foundation for exhibition purposes. During his reign, King Vajiravudh initiated the dressing pattern of the ladies of the courts. Women were to wear clothes according to the colour of each day, as of yellow for Monday, pink for Tuesday, green for Wednesday, orange for Thursday, blue for Friday, purple for Saturday, and red for Sunday. * Royal Bed Chamber: The bedroom has a four- poster bed with a mosquito net covering it. Next to the bed is a cabinet that houses a Buddha in Naga Prok posture (the Buddha protected by the mythical serpent). This posture of Buddha statue is for those who were born on Saturday, which was the day King Vajiravudh was born. A candlestick was also available as night lamps during that period, if generators did not work. *Royal Study: The display in King Vajiravuh's study is simple and straightforward. His desk and chair face to the sea, to the east. The king preferred working at night and usually retired to bed at three or four in the morning, therefore, a mosquito net would also provide cover above the desk and chair while he was working. The king preferred using sharp flat carpenter pencils when writing his plays. As for pens, he used original spring ballpoint pens with black or red ink. King Vajiravudah also preferred lined loose paper pads that he would send for binding after he finished his writings. He also kept a diary. The letter paper box with the royal monogram is made of dark purple fabric, which is the colour of Saturday – the King’s birthday. On the box there is also an embroidered Garuda (a mythical bird), an ancient symbol of Thai kings. This symbol originates from the Hindu belief that the king is the incarnation of Vishnu. * Chao Phraya Ramaraghava Residence: To the right of the king's quarters, between the Samutphiman and Samosorn Sevakamart buildings, is the residence of Chao Phraya Ramaraghava (Mom Luang Fua Phungbun 4), King Vajiravudh's Chief Aide-de-camp and the Grand Chamberlain. His residence consists of an office area, a living room, and a bathroom. In 1925, even though King Vajiravudh had built him a house on the north side of the palace when he married, Chao Phraya Ramaraghava still stayed in these quarters most of the time. However, since the palace building is open and has many staircases, the king sometimes assigned him to guard the palace at the north and that would make him stay at his house. General/ Admiral Chao Phraya Ramaraghava was born on 5 October 1890. He was the son of Phraya Prasiddhisuphakan and Phra Nom Tad, the king's wet nurse. Chao Phraya Ramaraghava joined the king's service at the age of eighteen, and was in charge of kitchen and secretarial operations. He attained his aide-de-camp job rank as the Grand Chamberlain, Privy Council Member, Vice President of the Wild Tiger Corps, Royal Thai Army General, and Admiral of the Royal Thai Navy * Front Court’s Dining Pavilion: Opposite Samutabhiman Royal Residence is a dining pavilion for Western cuisine. Mrigadayavan Palace has two dining pavilions: one for Western cuisine and another for Thai cuisine. During King Vajiravudh's reign, a Chinese chef was in charge of Western cuisine. On display, as in the old days, the dining table is set up in Western fashion. The chairs are British Chippendale. Dinners included several courses: hors-d'oeuvre, a fish or seafood plate, a meat plate. Red or white wine, desserts, fruits, and coffee and tea. On display is a dinner menu from 12 May 1926. King Vajiravudh usually dined around nine in the evening. White-tie, the most formal form of dressing, was his preferred choice of attire. It consists of a white stiff-fronted shirt, a white bow tie, a white low-cut waistcoat, a black tailcoat and black trousers with a single stripe of black satin. * First Samutphiman Royal Residence: Until 1925, this had been King Vajiravud'’s private residence. When Chao Chom Suvadhana, the king's wife, was five months pregnant during the summer sojourn, the king allowed her to stay here. By doing so, King Vajiravudh abandoned the court tradition of separating the men's and ladies' quarters, as the king was so delighted with his wife's pregnancy and wanted to be close to her. The furniture in this residence - the chairs, the dressing table, the bed - once belonged to Phranang Chao Suvadhana. They were mostly purchased during her stay in England and used at Ruenrudee Palace in Bangkok. The furniture now belongs to Princess Bejaratana, the only daughter of King Vajiravudh and Phra Nang Chao Suvadhana, who lent these private items to The Mrigadayavan Palace Foundation for exhibition purposes. The circular table is partly made of walrus tusks. * Phraya Anirudhdeva's Residence: Phraya Anirudhdeva (Mom Luang Fuen Phuengbun), the brother of Chao Phraya Ramaraghava, was one of King Vajiravudh's favourite pages. He was in charge of the administration of all pages of the court, and his specific duties included looking after the king's bedroom and his diet. As a result, his residence was close to the king's quarters. In 1925, when Chao Chom Suvadhana used the first Samutphiman quarter, Phraya Anirudhdeva's residence became bedrooms for her female attendants. Phraya Anirudhdeva then moved to the courtier's building that was close to the main building. The Foundation of Mrigadayavan Palace has restored this courtier's building and created an exhibition on the lifestyle of the royal pages and female courtiers. Similarly to Chao Phraya Ramaraghava's residence, Phraya Anirudhdeva's residence consists of a bedroom, a living room, and a bathroom. Phraya Anirudhdeva's bath is in red concrete. * Front Court’s Bathing Pavilion: *At present the two bathing pavilions are closed for restoration. To the east of the first Samutphiman quarter, along the roofed corridor, lies the open portico to the bathing pavilion of the front (male) quarter. Mrigadayavan Palace has two bathing pavilions. The northern one was for the king and the male attendants and the southern one was for the queen and the female attendants. King Vajiravudh enjoyed sea-bathing and this activity was also good for his health. The Front Court's bathing pavilion has a private changing room and a storage room for the king's canvas deck chairs. King Vajiravudh usually sunbathed in the afternoon around five. He had a special clothing style for this activity. \\"His Majesty would wear a red buttonless elbow-length cotton shirt that was slit open to the chest, and belt his shirt with red cloth. As for trousers, he used mid-length red Chinese-style trousers:, said one of his royal pages. Wearing red is a common practice of Thai kings. Vajiravudh's entourage would wear white shirts with grey, brown or black sports shorts. When the king bathed in the sea, thirty to forty male attendants would surround him for his security and keep watch for jellyfish. A cross-shaped wooden pole was fixed to the roof of the front court's bathing pavilion to hoist lanterns for communicating with royal family members, the king's guests, and his entourage who resided outside the royal residential complex. For example, when the king was getting dressed for dinner, the pole would display a yellow lantern, which was the signal to those involved in the fête that evening to get ready. If the signal lantern was green, it meant that the king was performing state duties, such as giving audiences, so no one was allowed into the palace's main gates at that time.  Bisansagara buildings (ladies' quarters)  From the king's bathing pavilion, southwards along the long corridor is the Pisansakorn group of buildings, the ladies’ quarters. King Vajiravudh originally built this quarter for Queen Indrasakdisaji. No males, except the king and boys aged under twelve of the royal family, were allowed to stay in this quarter. It was a royal court tradition to have female security officers in the ladies' court, known as klon or 'court police'. Small balconies in the corridor at the inner court were used as guard posts for the klon and working spaces for ladies of the court. * Living Room: The first room to the right is the living room. It was once the audience chamber of the ladies' quarter. At present this room is used as a classroom for Thai classical music lessons. The living room stores and displays various types of classical Thai instruments with the most significant of all is the ranad, a Thai xylophone. This ranad - which is covered with purple cloth - belongs to Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, the daughter of the current monarch. The princess played it with the border patrol police classical music ensemble in the 1990s when she visited the palace. There are also paper-mâché masks of classical music teachers ensconced on gold-leaf tiered tables. * Inner Court Dining Hall: Turning left and down the corridor is the palace's second dining hall on the right. King Vajiravudh regularly had lunch in the ladies' quarters. This dining hall served traditional Siamese cuisine, eaten in the traditional manner. The king would dress casually in a white loose-fitting Chinese jacket with a squirrel-tail-design pantaloon. He would be seated on the carpet and would eat in the Thai fashion with his hands. Food was cooked and prepared in the main kitchen on the west side of the palace. A food officer would taste all dishes before they were brought to the dining room. Dishes that had good taste and were poison-free would be transferred onto silver pedestal trays. They would then be placed inside gold-embroidered silk bags. The bags would be tied with cotton strings and a clay seal would cover the ends of strings. When ready, lady courtiers would carry them to the dining room and the seals would be broken in front of the king. Traditional Thai meals consist of a fried dish, a curry dish, a steamed dish, and clear soup, with dips and condiments. All dishes are served in three separate bowls for sharing, and they would be arranged in a half circle with a main dish in the centre. After the main courses, King Vajiravudh would wash his hands with lavender soap flakes. A lady courtier would then serve desserts, consisting of peeled seasonal fruits, traditional Thai sweets, or fruits in syrup or coconut milk. * Pisansakorn Royal Residence: Beyond the second dining room is the Pisansakorn royal residence. King Vijiravudh originally had this building for Queen Indrasakdisaji (née Praphai Sujaritkul), who was a daughter of Chao Phraya Suthammamontri and Thanphuying Kimlai. She was married to King Vajiravudh in 1921, and was titled \\"Somdech Phranang Chao Indrasakdisaji\\", the 'royal consort'. When she became pregnant, she was given the highest title as the queen. Queen Indrasakdisaji later suffered two miscarriages and resumed her rank as royal consort. Her residence consists of a living room, a bedroom, a dressing room, and a bathroom with a private balcony facing the sea. Periodic exhibitions display one of her dresses in this residence. It shows that the ladies back in those days preferred to wear long strands of pearls and wrap-around sarongs. * Phra Sujaritsuda’s Residence: The palace's southernmost residence was for Phra Sujaritsuda, an elder sister of Queen Indrasakdisaji. Phra Sujaritsuda was also King Vajiravudh's royal concubine. Her residence consists of a bedroom, a dressing room, a bathroom, and a private balcony. * Khun Thao Vorakhananan's residence: Khun Thao Vorakhananan (Mom Rajawongse Pum Malakul) and Khun Thao Somsak (Mom Rajawongse Poom Malakul) were household managers of the ladies’ quarter. Projects  From the Ladies' Court, gardening areas can be seen on both sides. These are part of Mrigadayavan's garden and ground restoration project to commemorate King Vajiravudh's distinct activities and his support for Thai literature. The project aims to develop the landscape of the palace that will meet requirements for the forest and animal protection scheme of 1924. This 1924 Government Gazette states that 2,200 rai of palace ground be conserved. Design of the gardens and their plants involve references from King Vajiravudh's literary works such as Sakuntala, Mattanabhata, Benjanaridham, and Venice Vanich.  King Vajiravudh's passion for music  King Vajiravudh was a poet and understood the importance of music to his people. In keeping with the king's vision, the Marigadayavan Palace Foundation has set up a Thai youth ensemble and a Thai Classical Music Scholarship Program (TCMSP). TCMSP provides free Thai classical music lessons to the children of border patrol police who serve in the Rama VI camp and the adjacent Naresuan Camps as well as children of The Mrigadayavan Palace Foundation employees. The program invites well-known musicians to teach on weekends. Prominent figures are Mr Sirichaichan Fakchumrun, former director of the Fine Arts Department and acclaimed National Artist in classical Thai music, teachers from the Plainern Palace, a palace associated with Thai classical music teaching, and teachers from Phetchaburi's Ladies Ensemble. The lessons include traditional Thai classical music and the compositions of King Vajiravudh and his contemporaries. King Bhumibol's vetiver grass project  In preparing the soil for the gardens, vetiver grass was planted to stabilise the soil and organic fertilisers are used to support the plants. Since the soil condition at Mrigadayavan Palace is both sandy and permeable, and the deeper soil is also hard and compact, it is not suitable for gardening. The Foundation of Mrigadayavan Palace has been working closely with the Phetchaburi Huay Sai Royal Development Project and the Phetchaburi Soil Development Unit to revitalize the soil. One solution is to plant vetiver that will loosen the soil and enable plant growth. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, or King Rama IX, initiated the use of vetiver to harmonize the soil. He stated in a speech on 22 June 1991 that vetiver was sturdy, had long roots and could grow in a net- like shape that could pierce the ground. The grass would also serve as natural walls in holding water, while protecting the fertile soil from crumbling and being a natural shield against weeds. Mrigadayavan Palace's soil development project also uses organic fertilizers in ploughing fresh vegetation into the fields, which will increase soil richness. After ploughing, the ground are cultivated with plants such as green beans and striped Crotalaria. Apart from having garden development project, The Foundation of Mrigadayavan Palace also uses its produce from the gardens in exhibitions, including flower arrangement demonstrations, perfume making, and traditional food decoration. Plants grown in the palace gardens are flowers such as jasmine, crown flower, bachelor's button, and herbs. The Foundation of Mrigadayavan Palace hopes that the garden area could serve as a cultural learning centre about local flora and court customs and traditions.

Kolderie at Fort Apache in 1997 during the month of June and released in early February 1998, Gently, Down the Stream is Come's fourth and, as it would eventually transpire, final album. As its predecessor, 1996's Near-Life Experience, a number of different musicians joined Thalia Zedek and Chris Brokaw to fill the void caused by the departure of drummer Arthur Johnson and bassist Sean O'Brien, the band's original rhythm section. Winston Bramen, who would later work with the Thalia Zedek Band and with Chris Brokaw in Consonant, played bass, whilst Daniel Coughlin was in charge of percussion and drums. Coughlin would also go on to perform with Zedek throughout her entire solo career. The name of the album can be seen as either a reference to the title of Su Friedrich's 1981 short film Gently Down the Stream or an allusion to the lyrics to English language nursery rhyme \\"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\\". As Zedek has stated, Arthur Johnson, the band's \\"drummer had made this recording of all these songs he had written, one of the songs involved 'row, row, row your boat.' Plus there was the cover we used (of someone watching an enormous wave collapse from shore), and I was thinking, 'gently down the stream' seems like a good theme for a record.\\" Moreover, Zedek has described the title as a \\"urination analogy\\". Personnel * Thalia Zedek – vocals, guitar, clarinets * Chris Brokaw – guitar, vocals, percussion, piano, organ * Winston Bramen – bass guitar * Daniel Coughlin – drums, percussion with * Beth Heinberg – piano on \\"The Fade-Outs\\" and \\"New Coat\\" * J. Michael Billingsley – acoustic basses on \\"The Former Model\\"  Track listing  Critical reception Upon its release, CMJ New Music Monthly called Gently, Down the Stream \\"a king-size record from a colossal band; those who like hard rock and have never heard Come are missing out,\\" whilst Musician Magazine began its praiseful review of the album with a rhetorical question lamenting the fact that Come was clearly fated to remain in the underground: \\"Have you ever noticed how the music industry regularly champions its disposable waste but can't seem to hold faith in the staying power of its true talent?\\" Billboard magazine listed Gently, Down the Stream as one of the \\"10 Essential Matador Releases\\", placing it alongside Interpol's Turn On The Bright Lights, The Belle and Sebastian's The Boy With the Arab Strap, Pavement's Slanted and Enchanted and Liz Phair's Exile in Guyville, among others. The Rough Guide to Rock states that Gently, Down the Stream showcased the band's \\"new-found delight in melody and volume settings lower than eleven (...) with the introspection overwhelmed by rage and thrashing guitarwork often enough for maximum listener comfort.\\" Speak magazine commented that \\"Come's fourth album doesn't meander gently down any stream. If anything, it's more like Whitewater rafting through a thundering maelstrom of guitars that empty occasionally into shallow pools,\\" going on to describe its songs as \\"12 gorgeous mini-epics [that] are by turns spooky and sleazy.\\" The Sunday Times' review of Gently, Down the Stream praised the album in unambiguous terms, suggesting that \\"as sandpaper-larynxed Zedek shares vocals with co-guitarist Chris Brokaw's softer tones, and Come abandon overdriven effects in the name of economy and songwriting, suddenly they're a great American rock band.\\" The review concluded that \\"Gently Down the Stream renders Come's indie ghettoisation absurd\\", stating the band's importance in no uncertain terms: \\"This is a world-class act.\\" References Category:1998 albums Category:Come (American band) albums ","title":"Gently, Down the Stream"},{"id":"26183918","text":"Plagiobothrys chorisianus is a species of flowering plant in the borage family known by the common name artist's popcornflower.

It was aired on January 27, 1976, was written by Burt Prelutsky and directed by Harry Morgan. As Prelutsky had written a number of episodes of Dragnet, of which Morgan had been a main cast member, the episode could be said to be a reunion, of sorts, between the two men.  Synopsis  Timeline:October 1952.Frank Burns has filed charges of mutiny against Hawkeye Pierce for an incident that happened during a busy surgical shift in the operating room. A preliminary hearing is convened to determine whether Hawkeye should face a court-martial, which could lead to his execution if he is found guilty. B. J. Hunnicutt is called as the first witness and begins to recount the events that led to the alleged mutiny. As soon as Colonel Potter departed for Tokyo, Frank assumed temporary command and immediately began to implement his gung-ho vision for the camp, including a ban on gambling. When he learned that Staff Sergeant Zale had lost $300, he instituted a camp-wide search for the money, ignoring repeated insistences that Zale had lost it to Radar O'Reilly in a poker game. Radar is called as the next witness and testifies to Frank's intrusive search methods, ending at Radar's own bunk in the camp office. Frank never found the money because Radar had hidden it in his teddy bear. The presiding officer, Lt. Colonel Carmichael, now calls Frank to describe the mutiny itself. Frank embellishes his account to cast himself in a heroic light - performing multiple difficult surgeries, bolstering everyone's spirits, and even taking over for an exhausted Father Mulcahy to administer last rites for a patient. He claims that an overworked Hawkeye drugged him into unconsciousness and took command of the unit. Hawkeye disputes the entire story, stating that Frank had been sending patients into the OR at risk of death during surgery, instead of doing the proper pre-op workup on them. Frank accused Hawkeye and B.J. of nitpicking and complained that the surgical staff would have no chance of keeping up with the influx of wounded. When Hawkeye half-jokingly threatened Frank with physical violence, Frank backed away and was hit in the face and knocked out by an opening door. Hawkeye sent Mulcahy to work in pre-op and had Corporal Klinger drag Frank out of the OR. Carmichael decides that the evidence does not warrant a court-martial and dismisses the proceedings, expressing his derisive opinion that Frank might have been made a pastry chef if he had not been drafted as a doctor. Afterward, back at camp, Hawkeye and B. J. start a new poker game and Potter joins in, ignoring Frank's un-rescinded order against gambling.

In 1985 he won two plane tickets anywhere in the United States and, on a whim, chose to go to Phoenix. When he got there, he felt connected to the place, and stayed. He began making mozzarella in his apartment and selling it to Italian restaurants.

Life Janko was born on 9 November 1905 in Ernsthausen () to a Roman Catholic farming family of Swabian descent. He studied law in Graz.Stefan Karner, Die deutschsprachige Volksgruppe in Slowenien. Aspekte ihrer Entwicklung 1939-1997, (Klagenfurt u. a. 1998), Anm. 95, pg. 45 (nachfolgend zit. als: Karner, Die deutschsprachige Volksgruppe19) Janko became increasingly racialist and pan-Germanic in his politics. On 6 June 1939, he was elected the president of the Swabian-German Cultural Association in Yugoslavia at the suggestion of the Reich agency Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle (VoMi). On 12 December 1940, he was awarded the Yugoslav Kronen-Orden Class III by Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković. After the invasion of the Wehrmacht early in 1941, the Cultural Association was disbanded and VoMi organised the Deutsche Volksgruppe in Serbien und Banat (DVSB) under Janko's leadership. Janko was simultaneously appointed an SS Obersturmführer in the Nazi-occupied Banat region of Serbia. \\"Like other wartime [German] minority organizations, the DVSB was restructured along the lines of the NSDAP. Its most important branch was the paramilitary formation, the Deutsche Mannschaft, which here, as elsewhere, came under control of the SS. Janko and the DVSB cooperated fully with VoMi, and as a step in the minority's total Nazification, it even introduced a system of classifying the local Volksdeutsche similar to that used by the DVL in Poland.\\"Valdis O. Lumans, Himmler's Auxiliaries: The Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle and the German Minorities of Europe, 1939-1945 (1993), pp. 234-35. World War II Danube Swabian German Cultural Association, delivers a speech to his fellow nationals in a refugee camp near Zemun 1940, during the resettlement of Bessarabian Germans into Nazi Germany according to an agreement between the Third Reich and the Soviet Union (then friends). After an initial burst of enthusiasm to join the German-sponsored Selbschutz (\\"self defence force\\") most Danube Swabians lost interest in the Third Reich. Voluntary enlistment collapsed quickly and in August 1941 the Waffen-SS enforced conscription and drafted local men into the Waffen-SS.Hans Rasimus, Als Fremde im Vaterland, München (1989), pg. 524. Janko objected and took the position that the legal obligation to provide services in the German Army for the members of the German ethnic groups (Volksdeutsche) did not exist, as this violated the Hague Regulations on war. Heinrich Himmler responded with dismay: “Es ist unmöglich, dass Deutsche in Europa irgendwo als Pazifisten herumhocken und sich von unseren Bataillonen beschützen lassen …“ (\\"It is impossible that Germans can be sitting around somewhere in Europe as pacifists and be protected by our battalions ...\\")Bundesarchiv Koblenz: R57/165 Janko responded by offering to set up a regiment of about 3,000 local ethnic Germans, with limited service interaction with the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS. In April 1942, Himmler created the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen and began to conscript Volksdeutsche from Banat and Romania. In his book (referenced below) Sepp Janko bragged about his ability to recruit sons of ethnic Germans from Banat region. This excerpt was used in Nuremberg war crimes trial in May 1946: > “ … I put at the disposal of the Fuehrer almost the entire German national > group in the former State of Yugoslavia and gave him so many volunteers as > soldiers, is to me a subject of great pride.\\" The Division was based in Banat but served across former Yugoslavia. > \\"The Waffen SS immediately enlisted 600 Volksdeutsche, and in July it > announced plans for the formation of an exclusively German regiment. But in > the Banat the SS encountered competition from the Wehrmacht, which had in > mind sponsoring its own unit, a militia force of some 8,000 men. Himmler, > alarmed by this development, took the case to Hitler and secured permission > not only to create a new, exclusively Volksdeutsche SS division but also to > take over the Wehrmacht's militia.\\" Escape Janko was able to escape the National Liberation Army (Yugoslavia) in late 1944 to Austria, where he was arrested by United States forces and taken to the Wolfsberg camp in Carinthia.Anton Scherer. Suevia Pannonica, Graz (2009), S. 112-14. He was interned with the Nazi ambassador in Independent State of Croatia (Siegfried Kasche) and the German minority leader in Croatia (Branimir Altgayer). Both of the latter were delivered by the British to Tito and executed, but Janko managed to flee internment to Italy before his extradition from the camp. In 1951 he fled to Argentina with a pass from the Red Cross, issued in the name of José Petri. (José stands for Joseph; Petri was his wife's maiden name. He had married Leni Petri in 1936 in a church wedding.) Janko was indicted by the Yugoslav government for war crimes. At the instigation of the Yugoslav government, he was arrested and imprisoned until his extradition. Due to intervention by President Juan Perón, Janko was released. He remained in Belgrano, Buenos Aires until his death in 2001, aged 95. Works * 1943: Reden und Aufsätze (In a series of the German ethnic group in Banat and Serbia).

After sex, the man had slit her throat open while she was asleep, then left in the morning. The murder became an ongoing source of prurient sensationalism in the press. For several years Sickert had already been painting lugubrious female nudes on beds, and continued to do so, deliberately challenging the conventional approach to life painting—\\"The modern flood of representations of vacuous images dignified by the name of 'the nude' represents an artistic and intellectual bankruptcy\\"—giving four of them, which included a male figure, the title, The Camden Town Murder, and causing a controversy, which ensured attention for his work. These paintings do not show violence, however, but a sad thoughtfulness, explained by the fact that three of them were originally exhibited with completely different titles, one more appropriately being What Shall We Do for the Rent?, and the first in the series, Summer Afternoon.

They are similar to but slightly thicker than the thinnest Japanese noodle type called sōmen. The Western style noodle that most closely resembles hiyamugi is probably vermicelli. They are the second thinnest type of Japanese noodle after sōmen, while the well-known udon is a thicker style of wheat noodle. Hiyamugi, like sōmen is traditionally enjoyed cold during the summer months. While sōmen are sometimes served hot in a dish called nyumen, hiyamugi is typically served cold, sometimes over ice or floating in water in a clear glass bowl. The chilled noodles are served with a dipping sauce on the side called tsukejiru that is made with dashi, soy sauce and mirin.  History  Hiyamugi are mentioned in Zenrin Kouta, a 14th century text by Ryoyo Shogei, critical of Zen Buddhism. This text was written shortly after the end of the Kamakura era and is one of the only known literary mentions of noodles from this period. According to Shogei, the Shōkoku-ji Temple complex had facilities for the production of udon and hiyamugi noodles and steamed buns called manjū. Within the Shōkoku-ji complex, the Uncho-in Temple was responsible for hiyamugi production. Due to the popularity of this style of noodle in the summer months, production of hiyamugi began on April 14 each year at the Uncho-in Temple. The Onryo-ken Nichiroku records kept by Kikei Shinzui between 1435 and 1466 at the Rokuon-ji Temple (also part of the Shōkoku-ji Temple complex) do not mention the \\"daily noodles\\" served to monks each day. It does, however, mention hiyamugi among the noodles served to visitors and guests as part of the toki (時) lunch meal. Hiyagumi are mentioned in the 15th century diaries of Japanese nobleman Yamashina Noritoki which states that on 19 June 1405 he was visited by one Genseido, who was offered a summer meal of hiyamagi.

Originally played by Yul Brynner, he is the functional equivalent of Kambei Shimada, the character portrayed by Takashi Shimura in the 1954 film Seven Samurai.  Description  Chris Adams, a Cajun, is the laconic leader of a band of seven gunmen. He always wears black, smokes cigars, and shoots sharp. He is a man of principle, incorruptible and sturdy.Tom Pendergast, Sara Pendergast \\"St. James encyclopedia of popular culture\\", vol.3. Published by: St. James Press, 2000 - 584 p. , 9781558624030 (P.240)  Character analysis  Chris, and to a lesser extent the others of the Seven, are examples of the \\"western hero\\"-archetype who is resolute, \\"single minded\\", \\"independent\\", \\"strong\\", \\"loyal\\", and \\"honorable\\" as well as having various other positive characteristics. \\"The key lesson that Chris teaches is the distinction between law and ethics, laid out in 1924 by the British jurist Lord Moulton, who distinguished between the realms of law and of ethics. Law requires obedience to the enforceable, while ethics requires 'obedience to the unenforceable'\\".Bob Stone, Mick Ukleja \\"The Ethics Challenge: Strengthening Your Integrity in a Greedy World\\". Published by: Wordclay, 2009 - 142 p. , 9781600376085 (P.10) Hence, Chris and the other members of the Seven \\"help the locals focus on the survival skills they will need\\" and their \\"leadership is necessary\\", even though it is essentially transient. They are \\"desperate for money, but equally in need of self-esteem, of belonging and a sense of worth.\\" Chris is not as cruel as Calvera, but like Calvera represents a way of life that is antithetical to humane civilization. Nevertheless, Chris and Calvera are morally equivalent and Calvera is in some ways preferable or at least, seems to be the more powerful and inescapable of the two. As a result, Chris has been called \\"a black-clad Shane\\". Portrayal Yul Brynner originally played Adams in The Magnificent Seven (1960) and reprised the role in the Return of the Seven (1966). Brynner's character in the 1973 science fiction Western thriller Westworld is visually based on Adams. George Kennedy played Adams in the Guns of the Magnificent Seven (1969), while Lee Van Cleef portrayed the character in the fourth film, The Magnificent Seven Ride (1972). Chris Larabee Portrayed by Michael Biehn, Larabee is loosely based on the \\"Chris Adams\\" character from the original films. His wife and son were murdered before the start of the series, turning him into a reserved but deadly individual. His quest for vengeance ia a recurring theme through several episodes of the series.  Sam Chisolm  Sam Chisolm, a warrant officer from Wichita, Kansas, and leader of the Seven, is Adams' counterpart in the 2016 remake. He is played by Denzel Washington.

It was filmed entirely in California over the course of 22 days. It was written, directed, and narrated by Richard Gale. The film won the Special Jury Prize at the Fantastic Fest, the Best Short Film award at the Fantasia International Film Festival, and the Citizen's Choice Award and the Grand Prize for Short Film at the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival, and was named the Best Short Film of 2009 by Rue Morgue. It was shot on a budget of $600, on a Panasonic HVX200 digital video camera with special effects created in Adobe After Effects, and edited on Final Cut Pro. It was not stated if the budget included equipment, software costs or salaries for the 30-day shoot. Plot The movie itself is presented as being a trailer for a 9 hour long movie. It starts with a voice- over, telling the viewer that: \\"some murders take seconds; some murders take minutes; some murders take hours; this murder... will take years!\\". The movie portrays the story of a forensic pathologist called Jack Cucchiaio (played by Paul Clemens; \\"cucchiaio\\" means spoon in Italian), who finds himself being haunted by a deranged-looking man (Brian Rohan), who is, without any clear reason, hitting him with a spoon. No one seems to believe this though as the mysterious attacker only shows up when Jack is alone. He is seen developing a phobia of spoons, stirring his coffee with a fork. Jack attempts to defend himself - stabbing the murderer in the throat with a kitchen knife. But to Jack's surprise his enemy turns out to be immortal, pulling the knife out of his throat and throwing it away, then continuing to hit Jack with the spoon. However, in this scene Jack also notices a strange sign on the arm of his attacker. Jack travels to the far East where he learns that his attacker is known as the Ginosaji (\\"silver spoon\\" in Japanese), an immortal and unstoppable being. It searches for a victim to terrorise and slowly kill by repeatedly hitting them with a spoon. The Ginosaji will follow Jack to the ends of the Earth, and it will never stop attacking Jack until he is dead. After this, Jack is shown travelling around the world, trying to escape from the Ginosaji or to fight it. He uses various weapons, including dynamite, guns, and an RPG. Since the Ginosaji is immortal, however, he will always survive and find Jack again. The last scene shows a weakened, wounded Jack, crawling in the desert, with the Ginosaji still striking him with the spoon. Then, suddenly, the spoon breaks. However, Jack's final hope is brief as the Ginosaji opens his jacket and shows dozens of spoons. Finally, the title and credits are shown in typical trailer style. Sequels A sequel, Spoon Vs. Spoon was later released on YouTube, in which Jack takes on the advice of a viewer to fight back with another spoon. This, however, backfired as the Ginosaji took away Jack's other spoon, and mercilessly used the second spoon for double-hitting. The Ginosaji has since used dual weapons with two spoons. Another sequel, Save Jack, was also released in the form of a game in which the player has to choose what Jack Cucchiaio should do, choices involving wearing protective clothing, using a giant magnet, giving the Ginosaji a hug or kicking it in the crotch. All of these choices backfired horrendously, making the situation more tormentingly difficult. The only one which almost succeeded was the magnet one. Unfortunately, the Ginosaji had a wooden spoon. A third sequel was named Spoon Wars and featured a duel between Jack (as a Jedi and armed with a blue lightsaber) and the Ginosaji (as a Sith armed with a spoon). The Ginosaji's spoon seemed to be made of an anti-lightsaber alloy. The duel eventually ended in the water when Jack was killed and then woke up from the dream. At first he thought that the whole Ginosaji thing was a dream, but he was proven wrong when the Ginosaji attacked him again. A fourth sequel, Ginosaji Vs. Ginosaji, featured Jack attempting to convince the Ginosaji not to attack him since he is another Ginosaji. Wearing make-up and a hoodie, Jack attacks another person with a spoon, but the person hits Jack instead and the Ginosaji is not convinced. An injured Jack tries to commit suicide by jumping in front of a bus, but instead gets attached to it and is dragged by the bus for a while. After getting loose, an insane old woman tries to kill him very slowly by hitting him with a cane whilst the Ginosaji also hits him with a spoon. Jack is knocked out as a passer-by tries to keep the old woman at bay, and finds himself in his 'Happy Place', where he meets the 'Happy Squirrel' who tries to motivate him. Jack then wakes up in a hospital where the nurse turns into the Ginosaji and chases Jack to the top of the hospital. Then, he attempts suicide by throwing himself off of the hospital roof. When he falls, he hits a fat woman who dies. The Happy Squirrel then tells Jack who is then admitted in the hospital that he won't be seeing him anymore. After a year of recovering, Jack tries again to make up himself as the Ginosaji, but far more convincingly. The fight happens in the Gobi Desert, where Jack loses and tries to kill the Happy Squirrel. Angry at Jack's betrayal, the Happy Squirrel urinates in Jack's face and runs off. At the end of the last video of Ginosaji vs Ginosaji, Richard Gale announces that there will be a real film of the story, which will be called GINOSAJI - The Horribly Slow Murderer With The Extremely Inefficient Weapon. Feature film Richard Gale confirmed he will be writing and directing a feature film based on his original short. On September 10, 2015, a 55-day Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign was launched by Richard Gale to help fund a real feature-length motion picture based on his short. The campaign was cancelled prior to completion, having raised over $100,000 in pledges. Gale launched a second campaign with a more modest $50,000 goal stating that he would receive partial funding from private investors but needed the additional crowd sourced funds to produce the movie.

The Swiss Ornithological Institute was founded in 1924 as a ringing station for researching bird migration in the Alpine region. Since then, it has grown from a one-man volunteer operation into an internationally recognised institute with more than 130 employees. In 1954, the Swiss Ornithological Institute was registered as an independent foundation under Swiss law. In 1955, it moved from the town hall in Sempach to a new building on Lake Sempach. Since 1958, the institute has also operated a bird ringing station on Col de Bretolet at 1923 m asl. The Swiss Ornithological Institute monitors Switzerland's native birdlife, studies the behaviour of wild birds and seeks to understand the threats they face. It develops protection and conservation measures for threatened species and, together with its partners, works to ensure that the results of its research are used for the benefit of nature and birds. The Swiss Ornithological Institute operates a care centre for sick, injured and orphaned birds. As a national centre of expertise in ornithology and conservation, it also provides information and consulting services to the public, the media and the authorities. The institute offers programmes for schools and environmental education services to raise awareness for the protection of birds, a purpose primarily served by the state-of-the-art visitor centre that opened in 2015. The three-storey loam construction is the first of its kind in Switzerland. The private status of the Swiss Ornithological Institute is unique and distinguishes it from other ornithological institutes, many of which are governmental organisations. The Swiss Ornithological Institute is funded by donations and can count on more than 2,000 volunteers to support its nationwide bird-monitoring programmes.

Westport: Greenwood Press, 2003, , p. 142. Life He was the son of a Huguenot French nobleman, who left France after the Huguenot-war of 1629. Having fought against Louis XIII at the siege of La Rochelle, Souches went to serve into the Swedish Army during the Thirty Years' War, when he fought under Gustavus Adolphus and Johan Banér and rose to the rank of colonel. In 1642 Jean-Louis felt insulted by the Swedish general Torsten Stalhansk and challenged him to a duel. As regulations forbid to challenge a superior officer, Jean-Louis joined the Imperial Army to continue the feud and distinguished himself as the commander of Brno's defense against the overwhelming numerical superiority of Swedish forces in 1645. After this success he was promoted to the rank of general and rewarded by previously confiscated estates in Moravia. Between 1657 and 1660, he fought in the Second Northern War where he invaded Swedish Pomerania in 1659. In the Austro-Turkish War (1663–1664), he commanded the Habsburg Northern Army operating in Upper Hungary. In 1664 he conquered Nitra and Levice.

Clinical cardiac electrophysiology enables patients with cardiac arrhythmias to be subjected to catheter electrode mapping and stimulation studies. Paul Puech, first in Mexico and later in France; Benjamin Scherlag and Onkar Narula in the USA; and Dirk Durrer and Philippe Coumel in Europe were the field's pioneers in the 1950s and 1960s. The field's second wave of innovators used these techniques to unravel the mechanisms of tachycardia in humans and set the bases for their treatment. Among them, Hein Wellens in Europe and Kenneth Rosen, John Gallagher, and Mark Josephson in the USA had the greatest impact as researchers and teachers. Josephson is the author of the first and most successful textbook of clinical cardiac electrophysiology, now in its fourth edition.Josephson, Mark E. Clinical Cardiac Electrophysiology: Techniques and Interpretations, Fourth Edition. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams Wilkins, 2008. Wellens, known among European cardiologists as \\"the giant of Maastricht\\", has for many years been associated with the University of Limburg School of Medicine in Maastricht, Netherlands.Smeets, Joep L.R.M., ed. Professor Hein J.J. Wellens: 33 Years of Cardiology and Arrhythmology. Amsterdam, the Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers; 2000. At his department of cardiology, many future clinical cardiac electrophysiologists trained from 1976 until his retirement in 2002.  Career  As a pupil and collaborator of Professor Dirk Durrer (1918-1984) in Amsterdam, Netherlands, Wellens was involved in the early developments in programmed electrical stimulation of the heart in patients with the Wolff- Parkinson-White syndrome. In these patients, cardiac arrhythmias it was shown for the very first time that were first shown to be possibly initiated and terminated by critically timed premature beats. In 1971, he reported on the use of programmed electrical stimulation of the heart in patients with atrial flutter, AV nodal tachycardia, and accessory atrioventricular connections. In 1972, he showed that the arrhythmia of patients with ventricular tachycardia could also reproducibly be initiated and terminated by timed premature stimuli. These investigations were the basis for the new surgical and pacing approaches to the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias that became known as \\"cardiac electrophysiology\\".Maloney, James. \\"Biography of Hein J. J. Wellens.\\" Heart Rhythm Society Online, Internet, , May 19, 1995. Wellens also demonstrated that the reproducible initiation and termination of arrhythmias by programmed electrical stimulation of the heart allowed the study of the effect of antiarrhythmic drugs on the mechanism of the arrhythmia. In 1977, he moved to the new University of Limburg in Maastricht, Netherlands, to develop academic cardiology there. Starting from scratch, he created an internationally known center for the study and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Wellens has published more than 600 manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals and more than 200 book chapters, and has written or edited 18 books on cardiology. More than 150 cardiologists from abroad have come to Maastricht for six months to two years for postgraduate training in cardiac electrophysiology. At present, Wellens directs a large academic cardiology department with a staff of 20 cardiologists and a cardiology training program. He is also a teacher and lecturer and member of a number of international cardiological societies. For over 30 years, he has been coaching a \\"How to Approach Complex Arrhythmias\\" course for cardiologists http://cardioacademy.info/documents/cy12/How%20to%20Approach%20-%20Berlin%202012.pdf and EP fellows, together with Mark Josephson. In 1990 he became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Biography Wellens, MD was born November 13, 1935 in The Hague in the Netherlands. He studied medicine at the University of Leiden. Following two years of internal medicine he did three years of cardiology in the Wilhelmina Gasthuis Hospital of the University of Amsterdam under the guidance of Prof Dirk Durrer In the late sixties, at the University Hospital of Amsterdam, he started to investigate patients with cardiac arrhythmias by placing catheters into the heart allowing the recording of cardiac activation at different sites. By connecting these catheters to a pacing device, he showed that it was possible not only to initiate and terminate the clinically occurring cardiac arrhythmias but also to localize the site of origin of the arrhythmia and to discover its mechanism. By using this approach, called programmed electrical stimulation of the heart, Wellens not only unravelled mechanisms and localization of arrhythmias in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, but also of the other types of supra ventricular tachycardias. In the early seventies, a major breakthrough came when he showed that programmed electrical stimulation of the heart could also be used to study the mechanism and localization of ventricular tachycardia, opening new ways for its treatment. In 1971 he published the first book on programmed stimulation of the heart in patients with tachycardias. In 1973 Wellens was appointed Professor of Cardiology at the University of Amsterdam. At that time it had become clear that this new approach allowed the investigation of the effect of drugs on the tachycardia mechanism and the development of new therapeutic strategies such as the termination of tachycardias by specially designed pacemakers, the surgical removal or isolation of the tachycardia substrate and ultimately cure from cardiac arrhythmias by catheter ablation. The work of Wellens has not only been the basis for the way arrhythmias are currently investigated and treated, but by carefully analyzing electrocardiographic recordings in relation to information from programmed stimulation of the heart, he opened new ways to use the electrocardiogram as a reliable (non-invasive) source to become informed about the site of origin and mechanism of a cardiac arrhythmia. Wellens left Amsterdam in 1977 to become Professor and Chairman of the Department of Cardiology at the Academic Hospital of the new Maastricht University. There he created his school of arrhythmology, educating in the period 1977-2001 more than 130 cardiologists from all over the world. Many of them, after returning to their home country, became leaders in cardiology. Wellens, who also directed from 1993 to 2003 the Interuniversity Cardiological Institute of the Netherlands (ICIN), an Institute of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, in which the Dutch research activities in cardiovascular research are combined at the national level, wrote or co- authored over 670 peer-reviewed articles, 254 chapters in books, and was author or (co) editor of 21 books on cardiology. In his scientific career Wellens made several contributions that changed the approach to investigate and treat cardiac disease.

He was a survivor of the \\"lost generation\\" who came of age in 1914, and was scarred, both mentally and physically, by the First World War. Lamb completed his training in 1915 as a right-handed artist. A war wound incapacitated his right hand, so that after the war he had to retrain as a left-hander. His urge to create was in no way diminished and his preferred medium was sculpture. Lamb's most productive period was from 1924 to 1933. As a result of an education on strictly traditional lines, he developed a style of modelling that was classically accurate, but which expressed the character and background of his subject.Obituary – RSA Annual Report 1951 p6. Although he modelled Queen Elizabeth II as Princess Elizabeth aged six, in 1932,Zealand, Gillian 1993 p33. he generally eschewed the rich, the famous and the heroic. Instead Lamb settled permanently in his native Montrose, Angus, Scotland, and sculpted the inhabitants of the town and neighbourhood, concentrating upon working class models, especially from the fishing community.Stansfeld, John 2013 p73 Fiercely independent, Lamb despised the young modernists and pre-war baroque fashions alike. He became isolated and developed severe depression around 1935/36,WLC e.g. letter of 31 January 1936. turning into something of a recluse. He never escaped poverty, never married and until the publication of a biography in 2013, his work was largely forgotten outside east central Scotland. Biography Lena Gaudie 1921. Early life and training William Lamb was born on 1 June 1893 in Montrose, Scotland. He was educated in the town and apprenticed into the family firm of monumental masons. His childhood was overshadowed by the alcoholism of his father. At an early age he became interested in art and attended evening classes at Montrose Academy.Montrose Review of 30 May 1968 p4. He completed his apprenticeship in his craft, and then moved to Aberdeen to work and to attend Gray's School of Art (now part of Robert Gordon's University). He volunteered in 1915 and served in the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders.Enlistment Book of Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders. Lamb was wounded three times and the third wound, in August 1917 at the Battle of Passchendaele, was a severe one, crippling his dominant right hand and arm. He convalesced in Montrose, and then in Edinburgh, where he received medical attention and attended Edinburgh College of Art. He learned to draw, paint, engrave and model with his left hand.Atkinson, Norman K. 1979 p2. In September 1922, Lamb journeyed to Paris where he briefly attended the École des Beaux Arts. In summer of 1923 he toured France on a bicycle, sketching what he saw. In the autumn, he went to Rome for several weeks and also visited Florence and Milan. He returned to London before the end of the year.WLC 2 December 1923. Ferryden Fisherwife 1929. Artistic career Lamb set up a studio in Montrose in 1924. He earned a livelihood initially by print making, almost all etchings,Stansfeld, John 2013 p61 and by drawing. Simultaneously he started to model whenever he had time or a commission. He gradually fell under the influence of Hugh MacDiarmid and the Scottish Renaissance literary movement which was centred in Montrose. This confirmed his resolve to make his work distinctly Scottish by modelling the ordinary men and women working in the community around him. In 1929 he won the Guthrie Award for the best work shown by a young Scottish artist at the Royal Scottish Academy's summer exhibition. The work was a bust entitled Ferryden Fisherwife.Bell, Leonard J.A. 1950 p16. Princess Elizabeth 1932. In 1931 he was elected an Associate of the Royal Scottish Academy (ARSA).Hartley, Keith 1989 p141. The following year he modelled Queen Elizabeth II, as Princess Elizabeth, aged 6½, and her sister Princess Margaret Rose. These were followed in 1933 by a head of their mother, the Duchess of York, later the Queen Consort and then Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. After 1930 the demand for prints declined and Lamb turn to water-colours for his bread and butter.Stansfeld, John 2013 p120 After his royal commissions, he built himself a new studio, but the collapse of a personal relationship triggered a mental breakdown and his artistic output suffered. As he recovered from his depression, Lamb found that the approach of war made it difficult, and later impossible, to procure materials for modelling.WLC e.g. letter of 18 December 1942 p2. He turned to wood carving and also went back to his craft, as a monumental mason, to earn his living. From 1942 the artist's life became a battle between his urge to create and debilitating kidney disease. He would die of kidney failure, having worked up until two weeks before his death. Works Sculpture Sou'wester 1947. Lamb's first major work was The Cynic, a head modelled from an apprentice in 1924. It was exhibited at the Salon (Paris) in 1925 as Tȇte de Garcon. The Young Fisherman was exhibited at the Royal Academy (RA) in London and the Young Musician (WSC) at the Royal Scottish Academy (RSA) in Edinburgh all in the same year. This trio of exhibits was unusual for an artist's first year. Betsy Baxter 1937.In the years following, Lamb's more important works were Old John (Père Jean Salon 1926), Violet Jacob (Doncaster 1926), Betty (Printemps Salon 1926), Purpose (RSA 1926), Self Portrait (Portrait d'un Artiste Salon 1927), Bob (Glasgow 1928), Old Salt (RSA 1927), Passing Shower (Dorothy Salon 1929), the Bud (Bébé Jeanette Salon 1927), Hugh MacDiarmid and Pittendrigh MacGillivray (RSA 1932), Ferryden Fisherwife (RSA 1929), My Model listens to a Tall Story (RSA 1940), Paresseux (RSA 1931), Princess Elizabeth (RA 1933), Princess Margaret Rose (RSA 1933), Duchess of York (RSA 1933), The Daily News (1935), Robert Burns 1936 (Sunderland Museum), Bill the Smith (RSA 1937) , Betsy Baxter (RSA 1937), Seafarer (Trawl Hand RSA 1938) and Edward Baird c1932 (Fleming Collection, London 2004). With the approach of war, Lamb turned to wood carving. In this genre, the more noteworthy works are The Beardless ChristRoberts I 1978 p388. (Five Figures set above the rood screen in the Episcopal Church of St. Mary, Newport-on-Tay), Wind frae the Baltic, Sou- Wester, The Shrew & Gale Force. Altogether 109 of Lamb's works were shown at the RSA annual exhibition 1925–1951. These included 84 works of sculpture, 5 prints and 20 drawings.Laperrière, Charles B. de 1991 p7. A number of his works can be seen in the William Lamb Memorial Studio in Montrose, and elsewhere in the town. Prints Calm Montrose 1928. Between 1924 and 1929 Lamb produced more than one hundred prints for the market. They are almost all etchings. Many are derived from the sketches he made in France in 1922/23 and most of the rest are of Scottish origin. There is an almost complete collection of his known prints in the William Lamb Memorial Studio in Montrose. Around 1929 the fashion for etchings came to an end and Lamb turned to water colours. Water-colours Although William Lamb relied on his prints and water-colours for much of his livelihood, his marketing skills were non-existent. This meant that he was never able to turn his talent to much advantage, or to escape from poverty. In addition to poor marketing, the artist was possessive about his water-colours. When he heard that a buyer was to visit, he would hide away his best works, in case the potential customer chose them.WLC e.g. letters of 29 September 1929 and 10 February 1930. Some critics have found the water-colours dull, but they are expressive of the Scottish east coast and they depict the working lives of those who live there. Drawings There are almost one thousand of Lamb's drawings in the William Lamb studio. It has been said that it is worth making the trip to Montrose to see these alone.Montrose Review 25 August 1955 p4 refers. The artist's style was minimalist and he was fond of portraying effort, both in men and in horses. The collections of pencil sketches and more formal drawings cover much of his life. Sadly his sketches of World War I and his life in the trenches became lost when he was wounded in 1917. Influences and Legacy Inspiration Torso II 1925. Hugh MacDiarmid 1927. William Lamb was fiercely independent and on occasion declared that his work was not subject to the influence of others. Nevertheless, influence can be detected throughout his work and, in moments of reflection he acknowledged this.WLC e.g. letter of 6 February 1926 p1. Firstly Lamb was an inheritor of the Scottish Enlightenment and the strong classical tradition rooted at that time in the country's educational system. When he went to Rome and saw for the first time the Greek and Roman sculpture and architecture, he described them as old friends.WLD – see entry for 13 October 1923. He admired their accuracy to life, their grace and simplicity. The second major influence was the Arts & Crafts Movement, active throughout the period of his education. He completed an apprenticeship in stone carving, as a monumental mason, and attended art classes in his free time. Around 1912 he decided that art was to be paramount in his life, but this did not stop him from practising his craft when convenience or necessity made it advantageous to do so. Old John 1925. When Lamb went to Paris he came under the influence of Auguste Rodin. He was a frequent visitor to the Hotel Biron. Rodin also had started life as a stonemason and decorative carver.Goldscheider, Ludwig 1939. His later sculpture displayed the realism and movement that Lamb judged so important. The Scot also acknowledged his debt to the Italian Renaissance and the subsequent French schools. The First World War made Lamb distrust authority and admire art that was simple and down to earth. He was irritated by Academism and disliked the Baroque form fashionable before the war. When he returned to Scotland in 1924, Lamb came within the orbit of the Scottish Renaissance. This movement was largely inspired by Hugh MacDiarmid who lived at the time in Montrose near to the sculptor. The aim of this movement was to make the arts central to Scottish life.Bold, Alan 1988. The rebirth was to be rooted in the great European tradition, but should exemplify Scotland. This was to be achieved through portraying Scots working in their local community and by describing the life of ordinary people. The sculptor grew to accept this tenet and lived and worked for the rest of his life in Montrose.Bell, Leonard J.A. 1950 p19. William Lamb was also a gifted draughtsman. He followed the teaching of Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran who had taught several of the French artists whom Lamb admired. The idea was to gaze at the subject for some time and commit it to visual memory. The drawing done afterwards would capture the essentials without extraneous detail. He respected Edmund Blampied, a skilled draughtsman, who was exhibiting in Paris while the Scot was there. He also liked the etchings of Charles Méryon and this artist's style influenced Lamb's prints.MMP e.g. letter to Jean Orkney Dec 1939. The final influence upon Lamb's art was World War II. Unable to buy artists' materials, he turned to wood carving. His sculptures in this medium are anonymous and often beaten by the wind. His figures had become cogs in the machine, lashed by the winds of war. Lamb's Legacy Bill the Smith 1936. With the exception of his commissions and in spite of his poverty, Lamb was reluctant to sell his work and especially anything that he thought was any good. This meant that he amassed a large and representative collection of his œuvre in his Montrose studio. When he died, he left the studio and its contents to the local authority. The present owners are Angus Council. The collection has received little public attention outside east central Scotland and is virtually unknown to the wider world. Nonetheless it shows Lamb as a master, possibly the best sculptor that Scotland has produced. Apart from the sculpture, his drawings, water-colours and etchings are all remarkable. They achieve the aim of the Scottish Renaissance by illustrating the life and the countryside of the Scottish Lowlands realistically and in humble terms.

The karuta are usually connected to each other by chainmail and sewn to a cloth backing, Met Museum New York. Tatami (畳具足), or tatami gusoku (from tatamu 畳む, \\"to fold\\") and gusoku (meaning full suit of armour), was a type of lightweight portable folding Japanese armour worn during the feudal era of Japan by the samurai class and their foot soldiers (ashigaru). The Tatami dō (a foldable cuirass) or the tatami katabira (an armoured jacket) were the main components of a full suit of tatami armour. Structure A tatami gusoku (complete suit of folding armor) includes a tatami dō or tatami katabira (jacket) and a tatami kabuto (helmet) chochin kabuto, or tatami zukin (hood) or similar type of head protection along with the other related parts of a full suit of Japanese armour. Collapsible head protection such as hachi gane and other collapsible armor are also tatami armor; a traditional kabuto could also be part of a tatami gusoku. Tatami armour was lightweight, portable, convenient for transportation, and they were manufactured inexpensively for the ashigaru light infantry. Tatami armours were worn by all samurai classes from the highest class to the lowest class. The higher class samurai wore elaborate armour while the lower class samurai and retainers wore simpler versions.

Dark purple wave represents the light from the light source. The light purple waves are the reflections from the cell membrane and from the glass surface. Upon hitting the glass surface, the reflected waves are shifted half a wavelength. When the membrane is very close to the glass, the reflected light will be reflected out of phase with the reflected beam from the glass. This will cause destructive interference (see red line), resulting in a dark pixel. If there is more distance between the membrane and the glass, the returning waves will be less shifted and will cause constructive interference (see red line), resulting in a brighter pixel in the final image. Indicated are the typical refractive indices of the glass, medium and the cell membrane, which determine the amount of reflection. Interference reflection microscopy (IRM) is an optical microscopy technique that utilizes polarized light to form an image of an object on a glass surface. The intensity of the signal is a measure of proximity of the object to the glass surface. This technique can be used to study events at the cell membrane without the use of a (fluorescent) label in contrast to TIRF microscopy. History The method was first used for the studying of thin films of oil. In 1964, the first application of the technique in cell biology was introduced by Curtis to study embryonic chick heart fibroblasts. He used IRM to look at adhesion sites and distances of fibroblasts, noting that contact with the glass was mostly limited to the cell periphery and the pseudopodia. The technique was refined and the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the technique were later described by several researchers in the 70s and 80s: Bereiter-Hahn and his colleagues correlated the technique with electron microscopy, showing that different mammalian cell lines adhere to the glass substrate in specific focal adhesion sites. Theory To form an image of the attached cell, light of a specific wavelength is passed through a polarizer. This linear polarized light is reflected by a beam splitter towards the objective, which focuses the light on the specimen. The glass surface is reflective to a certain degree and will reflect the polarized light. Light that is not reflected by the glass will travel into the cell and be reflected by the cell membrane. Three situations can occur. First, when the membrane is close to the glass, the reflected light from the glass is shifted half of a wavelength, so that light reflected from the membrane will have a phase shift compared to the reflected light from the glass phases and therefore cancel each other out (interference). This interference results in a dark pixel in the final image (the left case in the figure). Second, when the membrane is not attached to the glass, the reflection from the membrane has a smaller phase shift compared to the reflected light from the glass, and therefore they will not cancel each other out, resulting in a bright pixel in the image (the right case in the figure). Third, when there is no specimen, only the reflected light from the glass is detected and will appear as bright pixels in the final image. The reflected light will travel back to the beam splitter and pass through a second polarizer, which eliminates scattered light, before reaching the detector (usually a CCD camera) in order to form the final picture. The polarizers can increase the efficiency by reducing scattered light; however in a modern setup with a sensitive digital camera, they are not required. Theory Reflection is caused by a change in the refraction index, so on every boundary a part of the light will be reflected. The amount of reflection is given by the reflection coefficient r_{12} \\\\\\\\!, according to the following rule:{n_{1}+n_{2}}}} Reflectivity R \\\\\\\\! is a ratio of the reflected light intensity (I_r \\\\\\\\!) and the incoming light intensity (I_i \\\\\\\\!):{I_{i}}=\\\\left \\\\lbrack \\\\frac{n_{1}-n_{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}} \\\\right \\\\rbrack^2={r_{12}}^2}} Using typical refractive indices for glass (1.50-1.54, see list), water (1.31, see list), the cell membrane (1.48) and the cytosol (1.35), one can calculate the fraction of light being reflected by each interface. The amount of reflection increases as the difference between refractive indices increases, resulting in a large reflection from the interface between the glass surface and the culture medium (about equal to water: 1.31-1.33). This means that without a cell the image will be bright, whereas when the cell is attached, the difference between medium and the membrane causes a large reflection that is slightly shifted in phase, causing interference with the light reflected by the glass. Because the amplitude of the light reflected from the medium- membrane interface is decreased due to scattering, the attached area will appear darker but not completely black. Because the cone of light focused on the sample gives rise to different angles of incident light, there is a broad range of interference patterns. When the patterns differ by less than 1 wavelength (the zero-order fringe), the patterns converge, resulting in increased intensity. This can be obtained by using an objective with a numerical aperture greater than 1. Requirements In order to image cells using IRM, a microscope needs at least the following elements: 1) a light source, such as a halogen lamp, 2) an optical filter (which passes a small range of wavelengths), and 3) a beam splitter (which reflects 50% and transmits 50% of the chosen wavelength) The light source needs to produce high intensity light, as a lot of light will be lost by the beam splitter and the sample itself. Different wavelengths result in different IRM images; Bereiter- Hahn and colleagues showed that for their PtK 2 cells, light with a wavelength of 546 nm resulted in better contrast than blue light with a wavelength of 436 nm. There have been many refinements to the basic theory of IRM, most of which increase the efficiency and yield of the image formation. By placing polarizers and a quarter wave plate between the beam splitter and the specimen, the linear polarized light can be converted into circular polarized light and afterwards be converted back to linear polarized light, which increases the efficiency of the system. The circular polarizer article discusses this process in detail. Furthermore, by including a second polarizer, which is rotated 90° compared to the first polarizer, stray light can be prevented from reaching the detector, increasing the signal to noise ratio (see Figure 2 of Verschueren). Biological applications There are several ways IRM can be used to study biological samples. Early examples of uses of the technique focused on cell adhesion and cell migration. Vesicle fusion Two chromaffin cells imaged with DIC (left) and IRM (right). Vesicle fusion visualized using IRM. Scale bar represents 2 μm. More recently, the technique has been used to study exocytosis in chromaffin cells. When imaged using DIC, chromaffin cells appear as round cells with small protrusions. When the same cell is imaged using IRM, the footprint of the cell on the glass can be clearly seen as a dark area with small protrusions. When vesicles fuse with the membrane, they appear as small light circles within the dark footprint (bright spots in the top cell in the right panel). An example of vesicle fusion in chromaffin cells using IRM is shown in movie 1. Upon stimulation with 60 mM potassium, multiple bright spots begin to appear inside the dark footprint of the chromaffin cell as a result of exocytosis of dense core granules. Because IRM doesn't require a fluorescent label, it can be combined with other imaging techniques, such as epifluorescence and TIRF microscopy to study protein dynamics together with vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis. Another benefit of the lack of fluorescent labels is reduced phototoxicity.

They became very popular among Catholics in the later medieval period. Typically made of lead alloy, they were sold as souvenirs at sites of Christian pilgrimage and bear imagery relating to the saint venerated there. The production of pilgrim badges flourished in the Middle Ages in Europe, particularly in the 14th and 15th centuries, but declined after the Protestant Reformation of the mid-16th century. Tens of thousands have been found since the mid-19th century, predominantly in rivers. Together they form the largest corpus of medieval art objects to survive to us today. Pilgrimage sites housed a saint's relics: sometimes the whole body, sometimes a body part or significant object owned or touched by the saint. For example, St Thomas Becket was martyred at Canterbury Cathedral in England in 1170 and his body remained there, becoming the epicentre of an enormously popular cult. In 1220 it was translated into a costly shrine. The pilgrim souvenirs associated with his cult have a particularly diverse array of imagery, including that of his shrine, his head reliquary and scenes from his life. Other major sites that produced badges were Santiago de Compostela, Cologne, Our Lady of Rocamadour and Jerusalem. Their badges bore images that were iconic and easily recognisable, such as the scallop shell, the Adoration of the Magi, the St Peter or the Jerusalem Cross. Shrines to the Virgin were common all over Christendom, as are badges associable with her. They often show her holding the Infant Christ, or represent the first letter of her name. The practice is continued by some today. For example, knights and dames of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre receive a pilgrim badge when they travel to the Holy Land.  Origins  4th-7th century clay pilgrim flask or ampulla. Pilgrims used ampullae like this to carry water or oil from the pilgrimage site for Saint Menas: a late-third-century Egyptian Roman soldier who was martyred for his Christian faith. He is shown between the two camels who returned his body to Egypt for burial Various cultural practices converged to bring about the pilgrim badge. Pilgrims had long sought natural souvenirs from their destination to commemorate their trip and bring home some of the site's sanctity. The earliest and still iconic pilgrim 'badge' was the scallop shell worn by pilgrims to the shrine of Santiago de Compostela. Along with badges, vendors at holy sites sold ampullae, small, tin vessels designed to carry holy water or oil from the site. The later metal examples derive from clay ampullae sold from the Early Middle Ages to pilgrims to the Holy Land and other sites in North Africa and the Middle East. These often bore images from the saint's life. The main vessel of the early ampullae from the shrine of St Thomas Becket is often textured to appear like a scallop shell, showing how flat, wearable signs and ampullae came to be conflated in the medieval imagination. Badges and ampullae were worn while travelling and allowed others to identify the wearer as a pilgrim and the saint they were visiting. They showed the wearer's special relationship with the saint and could be called upon in times of crisis. Badges were an artistically legible and affordable accessory for the ordinary medieval pilgrim to wear. Manufacture and use A medieval cast lead alloy monogram of Maria pilgrim badge. The badge is in the shape of a Lombardic 'm' with crown above. The crown is formed of three projections; the two outer projections are trefoil and the central is a single collared knop. The outline of the 'm' has a beaded border and in the gaps between the columns of the 'm' the casting seam can be seen. The reverse of the badge is plain; the catchplate has survived intact but only the stump of the pin remains Pilgrim badges were cheaply mass-produced in bronze, cuttle-bone or limestone moulds or, less frequently, by die-stamping. Their easy reproducibility and modest media meant that everyone could afford them. British pilgrim badges often have an integral pin and clasp on the reverse whereas continental European badges more usually have sewing loops, but this is not a hard and fast rule. Pilgrims wore badges on their outer clothing and hats or around the neck to show where they had been on pilgrimage. Some were designed to be fixed to the top of pilgrim staffs. Freshly cast, lead alloy is shiny and bright but it tarnishes rapidly. To make thin, lead alloy badges, makers would have to create a eutectic alloy. Only at a specific ratio would lead and tin cast thin enough to make the most of the cheapest metal. The quality of pilgrim badges varied considerably, with some being naive and crudely made and others displaying great craftsmanship and skill. Ampullae, vessels for holy water or oil, were harder to make than badges, necessitating a process called slush casting. Much rarer examples were made in precious metals for the wealthy; these have mostly been recycled for their valuable materials over the centuries.Viewing Renaissance art By the later Middle Ages, thin, precious metal badges were being produced that were perfectly designed for being sewn into books. Manuscripts survive with badges still in them, or imprints on the pages where they once were. It is often possible to identify the shrine from the imprint. As artists became increasingly fascinated by illusionism or the trompe l'oeil technique, representations of pilgrim badges painted into the margins of prayer books appear. The most popular shrines sold over 100,000 badges a year, making pilgrim badges the first mass-produced tourist souvenir. In 1520, the church at Regensbury sold over 120,000 badges to medieval pilgrims, after a drastic shortage the previous year.  Archaeology  Today, most pilgrim badges are recovered in or near rivers. Lynn Museum in Norfolk has a large collection of medieval badges that were collected in the 19th century by children, whom the local antiquarian would pay for their finds. It has been suggested that this is because medieval pilgrims believed that the badges would bring good luck if they were thrown into water, however that theory is now contested.Pilgrim badge depicting St George and the dragon in the British Museum; J. Lee, Medieval pilgrims’ badges in rivers: the curious history of a non-theory, Journal of Art Historiography Number 11 (2014) https://arthistoriography.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/lee.pdf Many of the pilgrim badges in the collection of Salisbury Museum were found when the town's medieval sewers were excavated. This, among other evidence, suggests they were eventually just thrown away.  Modern Use  A scallop shell symbol is used to mark the route of the Camino de Santiago, whilst the practice of collecting and wearing a shell continues. Pilgrims walking with Student Cross wear a red fabric cross, along with carrying a wooden one.  Imagery  This badge represents the ornate head reliquary of St Thomas Becket and was probably sold near his shrine in Canterbury Studying the imagery of pilgrim badges quickly leads to an ability to identify the shrine or saint associated with them. For example, St Thomas of Canterbury is often shown being martyred by one of a group of four knights. The iconography of the scallop shell associated with pilgrimages along the Way of St James to the shrine of Saint James at Santiago de Compostela in modern Spain derived from shells collected by pilgrims on the beach. The relic of St John the Baptist's head, which was famously venerated at Amiens, is shown as a face on a plate. The images are frequently related to iconographic types found on monumental artwork, showing how mobile iconographies were across media and social spheres. Badges were made in the Middle Ages for purposes beyond pilgrim souvenirs; livery badges were presented to employees and allies by great figures, and became highly controversial in the decades leading to the Wars of the Roses. Some political badges have survived, including a fine one for the Black Prince.British Museum badge of the Black Prince 3D model of the British Museum's Black Prince Badge https://sketchfab.com/models/2f4f2bd7ed9a4ce6b10ac0d1fdec8257 Other badges, with motifs such as lovers' tokens and mini brooches, were perhaps a form of cheap jewelry. Erotic badges showing winged phalluses or vulvas dressed as pilgrims are prolific, although their cultural significance is still debated. Gazing at a collection of pilgrim souvenirs and medieval badges is to gain an insight into the visual world of medieval Christendom. In England the tradition of making and wearing pilgrim badges died out in the early 16th century as pilgrimage initially declined in popularity and was then banned completely as the country became Anglican during the English Reformation, when pilgrimage became regarded as a superstition and idolatrous; this halt on the practice was only temporary, as the practice of Christian pilgrimage once again became popular among Anglicans. The tradition continued in Catholic Europe, in some cases to the present day. Those of other branches of Christianity, such as Lutherans and the Reformed, also continue the practice of Christian pilgrimage, going to places such as the Holy Land, Iona Abbey, and Taizé.

He lived in Paris and in London and was awarded the Prix de Rome in 1823 as well as the Légion d'honneur in 1862. Labarre was born in Paris studied the harp with Jacques-Georges Cousineau and at the Paris Conservatoire with François Joseph Naderman and Nicolas-Charles Bochsa, also harmony with Victor Dourlen and composition with François-Adrien Boieldieu. In 1823, after having won the Prix de Rome, he travelled to England for the first time to give several solo concerts, also including Ireland. This was followed by travels to Switzerland and Italy, before he returned to France in 1831. He tried his hand, with varying degrees of success, in opera and ballet, but his popularity largely stemmed from his romances and melodies rather than from his large-scale works. The main focus of his work were compositions for the harp. In 1837, he married the singer Mlle. Lambert, with whom he regularly performed in England. He was conductor of the Opéra Comique between 1847 and 1849, afterwards \\"inspecteur accompagnateur\\" of the Imperial Chapel of Napoléon III, and finally (from 1867), professor of harp at the Conservatoire. His pupils included Joseph-Léon Gatayes and Félix Godefroid. He died in Paris.Biographical account mainly based on Labarre's entry in Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart (MGG), biographical part vol. 10, Kassel: Bärenreiter, 2003, cc. 949.

There were passing loops at Littleham and Budleigh Salterton. History From the beginning of the proposals for the Sidmouth Railway, promoters in the town of Budleigh Salterton had been putting forward schemes for an extension to their town from Tipton or from Sidmouth itself, and also from Exmouth. Exmouth had gained its own railway, the Exmouth Branch railway, direct from Exeter in 1861. One such scheme was put forward to extend from a junction at Tipton to Budleigh Salterton and through to Exmouth, getting an Act of Parliament in 1863, although Sidmouth itself had not got a railway at that date. The scheme came to nothing, and a number of abortive schemes followed. In one case in 1893 the Exmouth Dock Company opposed the bill on the basis that they derived £500 annual income from the conveyance of goods (by coastal shipping) from Exmouth to Budleigh Salterton. Finally the Budleigh Salterton Railway was incorporated on 20 July 1894, with powers to build a line from Tipton (later Tipton St Johns) on the Sidmouth Railway to Budleigh. The connection at Tipton gave access to the L&SWR;'s London to Exeter main line at Sidmouth Junction, and no direct connection towards Exmouth was included in the proposals, perhaps in response to the Dock Company's opposition. The L&SWR; was to operate the line, taking 60% of receipts (plus certain minor fixed costs). The contractors Lucas and Aird proceeded with the construction, and notwithstanding the loss of two temporary bridges when the River Otter was in flood during 1896, construction was completed early. Major F Marindin of the Railway Inspectorate passed the line for opening when he visited on 10 April 1897. The line was constructed to full main line standards with 82 lb/yd steel rails and creosoted softwood sleepers. Signalling was only provided at Salterton, the terminus, and by the Sidmouth Railway company at the junction at Tipton. The line accordingly opened on 15 May 1897, with stations at Budleigh and Salterton. There were eight passenger trains each way, one of them mixed, and one goods train. Budleigh was renamed East Budleigh, and Salterton was renamed Budleigh Salterton on 27 April 1898. Newton Poppleford station opened on 1 June 1899.Derek Phillips, From Salisbury to Exeter: The Branch Lines, Oxford Publishing Company, Shepperton, 2000, Closure Major reduction in the services along the line in the 1960s led to a corresponding decrease in usage. The line closed to freight traffic on 27 January 1964 and to passengers on 6 March 1967.

Macerola (January 31, 1942 – November 8, 2018) was a Canadian lawyer and film executive. He held a number of senior positions with the National Film Board of Canada and Telefilm Canada.  Early life  Macerola was born in Montreal, Quebec. He studied at the Université de Montréal, gaining his BA degree there in 1963, and then becoming a Bachelor of Civil Law in 1970. He was called to the Bar of Quebec in 1971, and began practising law with the firm Malouf, Pateras, Macerola.  Career  Macerola became involved in the film industry in 1976, when he was appointed Director of the French Program at the National Film Board (NFB).Evans, p. 243. During this time, he tried to make sure that the predominantly freelance film-makers of the French Program could not claim the status of permanent employees, which helped to save the NFB money, as more salaried employees would mean less budget available for actual film production. There was also a concern at the NFB that if a core regular team of French Canadian film-makers was allowed to build up, they could cause political problems with Quebec nationalism.Evans, p. 255. In April 1979, he was promoted to the position of Assistant Film Commissioner, making him James de Beaujeu Domville's deputy in the running of the NFB.Evans, p. 254. Domville stepped down from his role in January 1984 and Macerola succeeded him, initially on an interim basis but from May 1984 as the official new Government Film Commissioner. One of his first tasks as Commissioner was to develop a new five-year plan for the future of the NFB, after Minister of Communications Francis Fox tasked the organisation with becoming \\"a world centre of excellence in production of films and videos\\" and \\"a national training and research centre in the art and technique of film and video\\". Macerola dealt with the controversy surrounding the 1982 docudrama The Kid Who Couldn't Miss, about the life of fighter pilot Billy Bishop. Although produced before Macerola had become the Commissioner, in 1985 he was called before a sub-committee of the Senate to answer charges that the film inaccurately portrayed Bishop's career and achievements. Macerola refused to withdraw the film from circulation, although a caption was later added to the start of it to clarify that it was a drama-documentary and not a pure documentary. In December 1988, six months before his contract was due to come to an end, Macerola stepped down as Commissioner of the NFB to join Lavalin Communications. In 1991 he left Lavalin to take up a position as Vice President of the Board of Directors of the film company Malofilm Distribution Limited. He remained with Malofilm until 1995, when he joined the Canadian government's film and television funding agency Telefilm Canada. He served as the organisation's Executive Director from 1995 until 2001, and was Chairman of the Board from 2000 until 2002. He then worked as a lawyer for the Canadian government before joining the Cirque du Soleil, as the head of its legal department.

The accident killed all 65 passengers and crew on board. It was the deadliest aviation disaster to occur in El Salvador. Accident Aviateca Flight 901 took off on a nighttime flight from La Aurora International Airport in Guatemala City, Guatemala, to El Salvador International Airport in San Salvador, El Salvador. There were 58 passengers and 7 crew on board. The flight crew consisted of 39-year-old Captain Axel Miranda, 36-year-old First Officer Victor Salguero and five Flight Attendants. Two passengers left the aircraft before take-off: Jean B. Dupoux, an American, and Mark Dienstag, a German. After a 20-minute flight the crew of Flight 901 contacted air traffic control at their destination, El Salvador International Airport. The controller informed them that there was a thunderstorm with heavy rain over the airport and instructed them to fly over the storm and start their approach downwind to land on Runway 07. But the pilots and air traffic control were confused as to the position of the aircraft as it started its approach, and the aircraft entered the same bad weather that it had flown over. When it was at 5,000 feet (1,524 m), the Ground Proximity Warning System sounded; power was applied but it was too late. At 20:14 local time Flight 901 crashed into the side of the volcano San Vicente and burst into flames. All 65 passengers and crew on board were killed. An Aviateca Boeing 737-200, similar to the one involved Cause The Dirección General De Transporte Aéreo determined that the probable cause of the accident was the flight crew's lack of situational awareness in relation to the 7,159-foot obstruction, the flight crew's decision to descend below the MSA while deviating from a published transition or approach, and the ambiguity of position information between the flight crew and the air traffic controller, which resulted in the controller's issuance of an altitude assignment that did not provide terrain clearance. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the First Officer to direct his concern regarding reported positions to the Captain in a more direct and assertive manner and the failure of the controller to recognize the aircraft's reported position relative to obstructions and give appropriate instructions and warnings. An ineffective crew resource management program at Aviateca was held to have contributed to the accident.

Biography He was born in Bat Yam as Ya'akov Pijade to Bulgarian Jewish parents. At the age of 14, he started writing for a youth newspaper. After serving in Galei Tzahal and graduating from Tel Aviv University, he lived in New York and worked there as a US correspondent for Yedioth Ahronoth for several years. Media and journalism career Eilon at i24 news studio On 4 November 1993, Eilon anchored Channel 2's first news broadcast. In 1995, he was among the people who covered the release of the Kempler video in the aftermath of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin. He frequently presented the news together with Miki Haimovich until he left Channel 2 in 2000 and moved to Channel 10 in 2002. He was reunited with Haimovich a year later, when she joined Channel 10. In February 2012, Eilon sent his resignation to Channel 10 CEO Uri Rozen via email. Eilon and Haimovich weathered the economic storms that have frequently rocked Channel 10, but Eilon – among other highly paid staff members – did not get his January salary on time and was subsequently informed that the channel's management would be instituting a 15-percent pay cut among employees in the higher wage bracket. The Jerusalem Post, 22 February 2012 It is believed he quit because Channel 10 recently had to start broadcasting the main edition out of Jerusalem, whilst the rest of the producers, editors and reporters remained in the Tel Aviv studio. He claimed: \\"Even if the viewers do not fully understand that the studio picture is being projected behind me electronically, they notice, for example, that there are no more interviews in the new studio, and that we recently experienced a series of technical failures.\\" Walla, 21 February 2012 He presented his last broadcast on Channel 10 at 29 April 2012. Afterwards, he returned to Channel 2 as a news anchor for Keshet. During that period, he hosted an acclaimed documentary about anti- Semitism. He also anchored at Israel-based I24 News, presenting the weekly English-language program The World This Week. That program had disappointing viewer rates and was therefore taken off air. In January 2015, he returned to TV as a host of the prime time news program Mabat on the IBA's Channel 1 and remained on this program for almost two years. In 2017, he became an anchor and editor at Walla! News. Since 16 January 2019, the day Reshet-Channel 10 merger took effect, Eilon is the main presenter of the 5 pm IST edition of HaHadashot 13 (renamed from Hadashot Eser on that day). He presented a one- time special bulletin broadcast at midnight 15-16 January 2019, which was preceded by a pre-merger special.

Participating law enforcement agencies (domestic and foreign) with access to the internet can acquire 24/7 real-time capabilities to electronically submit firearm trace requests, monitor the progress of traces, retrieve completed trace results, and to query firearm trace related data in Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) firearms registration database at the National Tracing Center. Firearms tracing is the systematic tracking of the movement of a firearm from its creation by the manufacturer or its introduction into U.S. commerce by the importer, through the distribution chain to the first retail purchase. Release 4.0, a bilingual version (English and Spanish) of eTrace was deployed in December, 2009 for the benefit of Spanish-speaking countries. Features Through eTrace, registered users have the capability to initiate a search for traces in various ways. For example, users can search by a firearm's serial number, individual name, type of crime, date of recovery, and numerous other identifiers. Registered users can also generate various statistical reports regarding the number of traces submitted over time, the top firearms traced, the average time-to-crime rates, and more. This will allow any law enforcement agency to develop investigative strategies to reduce firearms-related crime and violence. The ATF's National Tracing Center assists Federal, State, local and foreign law enforcement agencies by tracing the origin of U.S. source firearms (only to the first retail purchaser) that have been recovered in police activities. Law enforcement can trace a firearm to develop investigative leads that may link a suspect to a firearm in a criminal investigation; identify potential traffickers; and detect in-state, interstate and international patterns in the sources and kinds of crime guns. eTrace includes the ability to interactively develop investigative leads relative to trace requests; a significant decrease in the turnaround time required to process a trace request; improved data quality of trace related information by providing real time data validation; the ability to monitor the status of traces in a real-time environment; the ability to view/print/download completed trace results; and the ability to generate various statistical reports and perform on-line analytical research relative to a jurisdiction. There are over 35 foreign countries now participating in the eTrace program as well as thousands of police agencies throughout the United States. Each participating law enforcement agency must sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with ATF and designate each authorized user by name.  Basics of ATF tracing  ATF's tracing system can only trace guns made in the United States or legitimately imported into the United States by a licensed importer in recent years. Guns imported prior to 1968 are extremely difficult or impossible to trace. All war trophy firearms brought back by returning veterans are impossible to trace. However, if such a gun was sold in recent years through a dealer who went out of business, it might be traced. The basis for ATF to trace a firearm is Make, Model and Serial Number. * Serial Numbers: Serial numbers on guns are not sacrosanct. Recording of serial numbers by ATF, police or dealers is subject to human error, as it is easy to misread a serial (for example: confusing the number 0 with the letter O, 2 with Z, or 5 with S), omit a digit or two, or transpose a couple of numbers. These and similar errors when entering a serial into the tracing system result in false traces. Certain categories of firearms will provide false results because of multiple duplicate serial numbers (German Luger pistols, P.38 pistols, K.98 rifles, for example). To further complicate the issue, it is relatively simple to add letters or numbers to a firearm serial (an illegal act) which will cause the trace to fail or produce a false trace. It is also simple to exchange parts on multiple guns such that (on certain pistols) the frame has one serial, the slide has another number and the barrel yet another number. According to the ATF National Tracing Center data, an invalid serial number was the most common reason for unsuccessful traces from Mexico, but the report doesn't clarify how a serial number can be \\"invalid\\". * Make: In a recent report, ATF has acknowledged that counterfeit firearms play an increasingly important role in the Mexican Cartels. Such counterfeit firearms could be completely unmarked or fraudulently marked with a manufacturer's name. * Model: Many firearms are not marked with a model designation, and many models look identical. The configuration of a firearm can sometimes be easily changed by exchanging parts to conform to a completely different model, or a completely different manufacturer. In 1998/1999, ATF repeatedly published the following disclaimer, \\"ATF emphasizes that the appearance of a Federal firearms licensee (FFL) or a first unlicensed purchaser of record in association with a crime gun [i.e. traced gun] or in association with multiple crime guns [i.e. traced guns] in no way suggests that either the FFL or the first purchaser has committed criminal acts.\\" In 2002, ATF reported, \\"A crime gun trace alone does not mean that an FFL or firearm purchaser has committed an unlawful act.\\" These statements have now disappeared from more recent ATF publications and reflects a shift in the official ATF position - such that ATF now considers individuals and dealers associated with multiple traces more likely to have committed criminal acts. Despite that many (if not most) traces are not directly connected to crime, a 2010 ATF eTrace PowerPoint Presentation to a United Nations Firearms Workshop publicly stated, \\"When you find several traces associated with multiple sales, you may have identified a straw purchaser\\", and \\"Identify FFL’s [dealers] in your Area Who May Cater to Criminals. By utilizing the Top Source Dealer report, you can potentially identify FFL’s who are known as a \\" criminal friendly FFL.\\"  ATF firearms databases  The ATF Firearms Tracing System (FTS) contains firearm tracing information from millions of traces performed since 1989, and consists of several databases: :1. Multiple Sale Reports. Over 460,000 (2003) Multiple Sales reports (ATF F 3310.4 - a registration record with specific firearms and owner name and address - increasing by about 140,000 per year). Reported as 4.2 million records in 2010. :2. Suspect Guns. All guns \\"suspected\\" of being used for criminal purposes but not recovered by law enforcement. This database includes (ATF's own examples), individuals purchasing large quantities of firearms (including collectors of older firearms rarely used in crime), and dealers with \\"improper\\" record keeping. May include guns “observed” by law enforcement in an estate, or at a gun show, or elsewhere. Reported as 34,807 in 2010. :3. Traced Guns. Over 1.2 million (2002) detail results from all traces. ATF reported 343,746 guns were traced in 2009, and a total of 4 million traces since inception. This is a registration record which includes Names and Addresses of the first retail seller and purchaser. :4. Out of Business Records. Data is manually collected from paper Out-of-Business records (or input from computer records) and entered into the trace system by ATF. These are registration records, indexed by serial number, which include name and address, make, model, serial and caliber of the firearm(s), as well as data from the 4473 form - in digital or image format. In March, 2010, ATF reported receiving several hundred million records since 1968. :5. Theft Guns. Firearms reported as stolen to ATF. Contained 330,000 records in 2010. Contains only thefts from licensed dealers and interstate carriers (optional). Does not have an interface to the FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) theft data base, where the majority of stolen, lost and missing firearms are reported.  Firearm data sources  For newer firearms not yet entered into the tracing system, ATF contacts the manufacturer or importer, wholesaler, and individual dealer to determine the identity of the first retail purchaser. The Firearm Tracing System provides manual & automated data retrieval from: # All previous firearms traces from all sources, # Dealer, Importer, and Manufacturer computer, paper or microfilm “Bound Book” Out-of-Business records (including digital files required by ATF Ruling 2008-2), # Dealer “Bound Book” records (computer and/or paper) copied or photographed by ATF during annual inspections. # ATF Form 4473 from dealers copied or photographed during annual inspections and in Out-of-Business records. # Multiple Firearm Sales reports (ATF F 3310.4) # Traditional phone calls to the manufacturer, distributor and final selling dealer, # Additional data sources, such as some state firearms sales records as required by state law or policy. # Dealer “Bound Books” over 20 years old voluntarily sent in to ATF. # Includes some antique firearms allowed to be entered in “Bound Books”. # Stolen firearms reported to ATF. (Note: Does not include stolen firearms reported to the FBI - NCIC, a separate system) # System 2000 automated retrieval system from manufacturers, importers and distributors (100 companies as of 2010) # Certain firearms dealers are required by ATF to report certain used firearms transaction to ATF for entry into the Firearms Tracing System. # For every firearm reported stolen to the NCIC stolen firearms database, New Jersey now automatically submits a trace to ATF (NJ Trace System). ATF is reported as working on a similar program. # Some state firearm registration systems are being loaded into the tracing system. # In a press release, New Jersey admits tracing (from police records) all of private gun purchases into the ATF Firearms Tracing System through eTrace. By state law, New York and Connecticut also require tracing of all such private purchase firearms. # ATF hired private consultants to catalog information on firearms and submit trace requests from police departments to ATF. # ATF has imposed a requirement (pilot project) to report all dealer multiple sales (2 or more) of all semi-auto rifles with a detachable magazine greater than .22 caliber. (Currently restricted to California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas - border states with Mexico). Reported justification is to identify \\"straw purchasers\\" and weapons traffickers. However, this ruling will include 100-year-old Model 1907 Winchester rifles, WWII M1 Carbines, German G43 rifles, FN 49 rifles, and many other historic firearms of primary interest to collectors and are not known to be used by Mexican drug catels. William J. Hoover (ATF Acting Deputy Director) denied that ATF is seeking to create a national registry (a national registry already exists, see above), and said records would be kept for 24 months and then destroyed if not acted on by investigators. However, this is contrary to current ATF practice and neither assertion is supported by the documentation.  Firearms tracing reports   Criticism of eTrace statistics  As far back as 1992, and as recently as 2009, the Congressional Research Service has warned about the use of statistics from ATF's tracing system. \\"The ATF tracing system is an operational system designed to help law enforcement agencies identify the ownership path of individual firearms. It was not designed to collect statistics.\\" According to the Congressional Research Service, the information from firearms searches is limited and may be biased by several factors: :• traced firearms are generally recovered by law enforcement, and they may not be representative of firearms possessed and used by criminals; :• there remains significant variation over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction as to \\"when, why, and how\\" a firearm is recovered and selected to be traced; and :• a substantial percentage of recovered firearms cannot be successfully traced for several reasons.\\" On June 9, 2009 the Department of Homeland Security criticized ATF's tracing system, observing that it has numerous problems with data collection and sample populations which render some of ATF's statistics as unreliable. DHS actually contributed to the problems with the data errors and ATF's statistics problems by entering incomplete trace data from open sources and not entering the complete information on the firearm (make, model, caliber, manufacturer, importer if any). On many occasions, either ATF or CENAPI would go in and try to enter the full and correct data on a firearm only to find that DHS had already started an entry in ETrace causing problems. 'Most trace requests that are submitted to ATF from Mexico are considered “unsuccessful” because of missing or improperly entered gun data'. Nevertheless, ATF has continued to generate and quote misleading eTrace statistics, particularly regarding seized Mexican guns.  Firearms trace summary report  Individual trace results can be printed directly from eTrace and summarizes the firearm's trace pedigree to the first purchaser. The Firearms Trace Summary shows the full firearm description, requesting agency information, and possessor and recovery location (if provided by the requestor). If the firearm is traced successfully, the name of the [first] purchaser, the identification used, physical description, place of purchase, and a calculation of the time period between the retail sale and the criminal recovery (time-to-crime) is also given. What Trace Results Look Like: In addition to seeing the most recent trace results on the home page, users can select views of any or all of their trace results by going to the Search for Trace Results screen. eTrace's analytical tool allows the user to perform both quick searches or detailed, multilayered searches from trace data. For example, a typical search can be for all persons with the same last name or who used identical identification when purchasing firearms. A multilayered search might involve purchasers of a specific caliber of firearm who show a place of birth in a specific foreign country. eTrace's referral list identifies other departments and agencies with information in common and provides the contact information for their linked traces. A referral list is included in every trace result. Specifically, if a department's firearms trace has a purchaser and/or possessor who match by date of birth and name, or a firearms licensee, and/or a recovery location in common, this list will display the name and contact information for the other department or agency. This remarkable resource can make departments with common points able to work together if warranted.  Firearms trace summary report detail  (See above report image) This report contains no disclaimer that the report identifies only the first purchaser, who may have no connection to the person found in possession of the firearm, nor any indication of presumed innocence of the purchaser nor the selling dealer. This report is provided to Mexican police (see Mexican Police Corruption below) from the bilingual eTrace program provided to Mexico. * Firearm Information: Manufacturer, Model, Caliber, Serial Number, Type (Pistol, Rifle, etc.), Country of manufacture & Importer. * Recovery Information: Recovery date, \\"Time to Crime\\" (age of firearm), Recovery address. * Purchaser Information: (First purchaser only). Purchase Date, Full Name and Full Address, Date of Birth, Place of Birth, Race, Sex, Social Security Number, Drivers License Number, Height, Weight. * Dealer Information: FFL Number, Name and Full Address, Phone Number, Ship Date (Date of Receipt). * Summary of Results: Narrative by ATF of the trace results. * Additional Dealer Information: Full transfer path from Importer or Manufacturer, to Distributor, to Dealer. Includes Full Name and Full Address of each, Point of Contact Name, Dealer Notes, Associated Traces (All other traces connected to dealer), Phone Number, Fax Number, FFL Number, Invoice Number (if any), Date of Last ATF Inspection * Additional Individual Information: All information from 'Purchaser' above, plus: Criminal History, AKA (Alias) Name, AKA Date of Birth, Associated Traces (All other traces or multiple gun purchases for that last name and Date of Birth). * Recovery Location: All the information in 'Recovery' above, plus Type of Recovery (On Person, etc.), detail Vehicle Information (including license number), all other traces for that Street Name, City and State. Limitations eTrace only tracks firearms to the \\"first retail purchase\\". Many (if not most) such guns have been subsequently sold or stolen - perhaps many times. Nevertheless, eTrace only points to the first purchaser, who is then automatically reported to the requesting agency, including foreign police. eTrace does not and cannot (at the present time) trace firearm ownership to the last owner, nor to any intermediate owners, which is a major limitation in the eTrace system. All traced guns are called \\"crime guns\\" by ATF, regardless of involvement in a crime. ATF has defined \\"crime gun\\" to mean \\"any firearm that is illegally possessed, used in a crime, or suspected to have been used in a crime.\\" An abandoned firearm may also be categorized as a crime gun if it is suspected it was used in a crime or illegally possessed.\\" Since any firearm \\"might\\" have been involved in a crime, ATF considers any and all firearms to be a \\"crime gun\\" or a \\"suspect gun\\" and any trace to be a \\"bona fide law enforcement investigation\\". Regardless of disposition or current ownership, ATF sometimes trace, track, or enter as a \\"suspect gun\\", every firearm entered in a dealer's records to see if any will link to a crime in the past, or might be connected to a crime in the future. ATF's position is that gun tracing is voluntary for other law enforcement jurisdictions, but urges law enforcement to trace every firearm under the \\"bona fide law enforcement investigation\\" rationale. Some agencies or jurisdictions trace all recovered guns as a matter of state or local policy or law, while others trace all guns reported as sold within the jurisdiction as required by law or policy, and other agencies trace only when needed for specific investigations. Some jurisdiction do not trace. Implementation ATF publicized global eTrace access in United Nations Disarmament Marking and Tracing Workshops held in Nairobi, Kenya in December, 2007, Lomé, Togo in April, 2008, Rio de Janeiro in June, 2008, and other locations. ATF reports over 2,000 agencies around the world and over 10,000 individuals have access to first purchaser American gun owner personal information. Tracing data is of no value without identifying the individual purchaser (name & address), so ATF specifically provides \\"a description of the original retail purchaser\\" to the requestor. In GAO Report 09-709, ATF reports the National Tracing Center, “conducts the gun traces, and returns information on their findings to the submitting party”. The U.S. Tiahrt Amendment and the 2008 Appropriations Bill specifically (financially) prohibits ATF from disclosing certain personal information from the Firearms Tracing System and retrieving information by name. However, foreign governments and agencies are under no such restriction. There is a legal restriction in the Memorandum of Understanding to prevent disclosure of names and addresses, but it is difficult to detect and enforce. Colombia and Mexico were provided with their own in-country tracing centers with full access to ATF firearm registration records. In Colombia, a joint ATF-CNP Center for Anti-Explosives Information and Firearms Tracing (CIARA) opened on December 6, 2006. In Mexico, The National Center for Information, Analysis and Planning in order to Fight Crime (CENAPI) was established in 2003. ATF states these are models for planned future tracing centers throughout Central and South America and the Caribbean Basin. This raises major privacy issues for first purchaser American gun purchasers because the data includes: Name, address, date of birth, place of birth, height, weight, sex, driver's license information, and vehicle information. Social Security Number is frequently included in ATF Form 4473, and may be accessed during a trace. Some 17,000 individuals have formal access to eTrace. Foreign police agencies (33 currently known) formally provided with eTrace software and access to first purchaser American gun owner suspect names and addresses include: :Albania, Anguilla, Antigua, Aruba, Australia, the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Belize, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Canada, Cayman Islands, Colombia, Costa Rica, Curacao, Czech Republic, Dominica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Finland, Germany, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Jamaica, Japan, Kosovo, Mexico, Montserrat, Nicaragua, Panama, Slovakia, Spain, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United Kingdom. Of these, many have police corruption issues or known anti- firearms bias. ATF plans to add more countries in the near future. A Spanish- language version of the eTrace System was deployed in 2009 to Mexico, Guatemala and Costa Rica.ATF Press Release (30 December 2009) All three countries have widespread police corruption issues. ATF declared a specific goal to provide eTrace software to all 31 states within Mexico. Testimony by William Hoover , Assistant Director, Field Operations, ATF. Feb. 7, 2008.  Tracing seized Mexican guns  Project Gunrunner is part of ATF's effort to collaborate with the Mexican authorities and its \\"cornerstone\\" has been the expansion of eTrace. Since 1992 (and as recently as 2009), the Congressional Research Service has repeatedly stated that the ATF tracing system is an operational system designed to help law enforcement agencies identify the ownership path of individual firearms and was not designed to collect statistics. Nevertheless: * In February 2008, William Hoover, Assistant Director for Field Operations of ATF testified before Congress that over 90% of the firearms that have either been recovered in, or interdicted in transport to Mexico, originated from various sources within the United States.. * In May, 2008, William Newell, Special Agent in Charge of the ATF Phoenix Office reported: \\"When 90 percent-plus of the firearms recovered from these violent drug cartels are from a U.S. source, we have a responsibility to do everything we can to stem the illegal flow of these firearms to these thugs.\\" * On 17 March 2009, Senator Dick Durbin stated in a Congressional Hearing, \\"According to ATF [the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives], more than 90 percent of the guns seized after raids or shootings in Mexico have been traced right here to the United States of America.\\" Senator Feinstein added: \\"It is unacceptable to have 90 percent of the guns that are picked up in Mexico used to shoot judges, police officers, mayors, kidnap innocent people and do terrible things come from the United States.....\\" * On 25 March 2009, while in Mexico City, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recorded an interview with Lara Logan, saying, \\"the guns that are used by the drug cartels against the police and the military, 90 percent of them come from America.\\" * On April 2, 2009, Fox News published \\"The Myth of 90 Percent: Only a Small Fraction of Guns in Mexico Come From U.S.\\". * In April, 2009, President Barack Obama was in Mexico City and at a joint press conference with Mexican President Felipe Calderon, and repeated the same statement (just discredited by Fox News): \\"More than 90 percent of the guns recovered in Mexico come from the United States....” * On June 19, 2009, The U.S. Government Accountability Office reported to Congress \\"Using ATF’s eTrace data......Over 90 percent of the firearms seized in Mexico and traced over the last 3 years have come from the United States.\\" * On July 16, 2009, William McMahon, Deputy Assistant Director for Field Operations, ATF, testified before Congress that about 90 percent of the guns recovered in Mexico that ATF has traced were initially sold in the United States. (Committee on Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border, Maritime, and Global Counterterrorism, U.S. House of Representatives, concerning “Combating Border Violence: The Role of Interagency Coordination in Investigations”). * in September 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) issued a draft report critical of Project Gunrunner, followed by the final version in November, 2010. The OIG analysis of ATF data shows, of the guns submitted for tracing, a much lower percentage of guns traced to the United States, ranging from 44 percent in FY 2005, falling to 27 percent in FY 2007 and 31 percent in FY 2009. These percentages significantly differ from those in ATF testimony before Congress (see above). * Between September and November 2010, ATF admitted that “the 90% figure cited to Congress could be misleading\\" because it applied only to the small portion of Mexican crime guns that are traced.” During this 2010 review by the OIG, ATF could not provide updated information on the percentage of traced Mexican crime guns that originated in or imported through the United States. * In October 2010, ATF announced they would no longer release estimates of how many guns came from the United States because the numbers have become \\"too politicized\\". ATF stated, \\"It doesn't matter if 20 percent are coming from the U.S. or 80 percent...\\". * On December 14, 2010, despite ATF's announcement they would no longer release estimates, NBC reported \\"U.S. firearms agents estimate that around 80 percent of the weapons used by Mexican drug traffickers come from the United States...\\", a percentage previously disavowed by ATF and discredited by the DOJ OIG in November 2010 (see above). * On February 10, 2011, Stratfor Global Intelligence published an analysis which concluded \\"almost 90 percent of the guns seized in Mexico in 2008 were not traced back to the United States.\\" * On June 10, 2011, The Wall Street Journal reported new ATF statistics provided by ATF Acting Director Kenneth E. Melson to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.), that 70% of the firearms recovered in Mexico and submitted for ATF tracing, passed through the U.S. at some point. The statistics do not show how many were legitimate export sales to Mexico and other countries; a serious discrepancy. The findings come as ATF defends itself in congressional hearings for ATF Project Gunrunner, which lawmakers say permitted, encouraged and facilitated trafficking thousands of firearms to Mexican drug cartels. The OIG analysis of ATF data concluded that ATF's attempts to expand gun tracing in Mexico have been unsuccessful. Increasingly, ATF finds that Mexican cartels transport firearms and munitions into Mexico from Guatemala, situated on Mexico's southern border. Although the number of trace requests from Mexico has increased since FY 2006, most seized guns in Mexico are not traced. Moreover, most trace requests from Mexico do not succeed in identifying the gun dealer who originally sold the gun, and the rate of successful traces has declined since the start of Project Gunrunner. Most Mexican crime gun trace requests that were successful were untimely and of limited use for generating investigative leads. The average age of traced Mexican guns is 14 years, and over 75 percent of traced Mexican guns were over five years old and the information considered useless for law enforcement purposes. Senior Mexican law enforcement authorities interviewed by U.S. OIG officers do not view gun tracing as an important investigative tool because it implicates only the innocent and legitimate parties in the gun production and distribution network, due to limitations in the information tracing typically provides. It is important to note that Mexican law enforcement has no jurisdiction in the United States. ATF fails to address misleading factors in statistics of seized Mexican guns. For example, ATF fails to separately identify: *1. American origin guns legitimately sold to the Mexican military. *2. American origin guns legitimately and commercially exported to the Mexican gun shop in Mexico City. *3. American origin guns legitimately sold to Mexican police - at the Federal, state or local level. *4. American origin guns legitimately sold to Mexican banks, private security firms, or other companies. *5. American origin guns legitimately sold to other Mexican government entities. *6. American origin guns legitimately sold to police, military, security companies or private parties in other countries, which have been smuggled into Mexico. *7. American origin guns exported to Mexico many years ago. (The average age of traced guns from Mexico is over 14 years). *8. Foreign guns with American markings which were never imported into the United States for any number of reasons. *9. Counterfeit guns made elsewhere with fake American markings. ATF has acknowledged this is a problem. *10. Frequently, pictures of seized Mexican guns show many .22 rimfire rabbit rifles and sporting shotguns. Are these included in ATF statistics? ATF doesn't say. If ATF or Mexican police do not collect tracing information quickly, it becomes unavailable. In accordance with Mexican law, all guns seized by the Mexican government must be surrendered to the Mexican Army within 48 hours. After the Mexican military obtains custody of the guns, ATF or Mexican federal police is unlikely to gain timely access to them to gather the information needed to initiate traces. Mexican Army officials interviewed by OIG personnel said their role is to safeguard the weapons and that they have no specific authority to assist in trafficking investigations. To gain access to the weapons, ATF officials must make a formal request to the Attorney General of Mexico for each gun, citing a specific reason that access is needed, demonstrating that the requested information is related to a Mexican criminal investigation, and providing a description of the gun with the serial number. However, if ATF had the gun description and serial number, ATF officials would not need to request access to the gun. Due to these barriers, ATF and wider Department efforts to gain access to weapons in Mexican military custody have not been successful. The majority of seized Mexican crime guns are not traced. The report states that the poor quality of the tracing data and the resulting high rate of unsuccessful traces suggest that the training is insufficient, training has been provided to the wrong people, or there are other unidentified problems with Mexican law enforcement's crime gun tracing. The final OIG report, which was released in November 2010, concludes that because ATF has not been able to communicate the value of gun tracing to Mexican law enforcement officials, Mexican police are less likely to prioritize their efforts to obtain tracing information from seized crime guns and enter it into eTrace. This hinders ATF's plans to deploy Spanish eTrace throughout Mexico. Because the expansion of tracing in Mexico is the cornerstone of Project Gunrunner, this presents a significant barrier to full implementation of ATF's Gunrunner strategy. The OIG report also revealed ATF has been unable to respond to many training and support requests from Mexican government agencies, and ATF's backlog of requests for information from Mexican authorities has hindered coordination between ATF and Mexican law enforcement. In addition, it was found that ATF has not staffed or structured its Mexico Country Office to fully implement Project Gunrunner's missions in Mexico. In 2009, Mexico reported they held 305,424 confiscated firearms. Regardless of innocence, first purchaser American gun owner names and addresses, detailed personal information from gun purchases (from form 4473 - including date of birth, possibly Social Security Number), and detail on other guns purchased by owner name is directly available to some 35 foreign governments, including governments with known corruption issues. Over 360,000 trace requests were processed in fiscal year 2014. Trace requests have been accepted by ATF from over 60 foreign governments (some with terrorist connections). ATF admits the identity of the firearms purchaser provided to a foreign law enforcement agency is of particular concern to people, because the purchaser is not necessarily involved in any crime. However, ATF claims it has no record of an American being at risk in a foreign country as a result of innocent involvement in the history of a firearm subsequently recovered and traced by a law enforcement agency, although ATF does not mention how they would know if an American was at risk. According to the U.S. State Department, Americans have become victims of harassment, mistreatment and extortion by Mexican law enforcement and other officials. In Mexico (as in many other countries), anyone accused of a crime is \\"guilty until proven innocent\\", and cash bail may be the only option to avoid incarceration. ATF Project Gunrunner has a stated official objective to stop the sale and export of guns from the United States into Mexico in order to deny Mexican drug cartels the firearms considered \\"tools of the trade\\". However, under Project Gunrunner, Operations \\"Fast and Furious\\", \\"Too Hot to Handle\\" and others, are alleged to have done the opposite by ATF permitting and facilitating 'straw purchase' firearm sales to traffickers, and allowing the guns to 'walk' and be transported to Mexico. This has resulted in considerable controversy. When U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was murdered 14 December 2010, suspicions centered on \\"Fast and Furious\\" weapons. The break in the case can be traced to a 22 December 2010 posting on the Forums (Message Board) of the CleanUpATF web site by \\"1desertrat\\", who stated \\"One of these [\\"Fast and Furious\\"] rifles is rumored to have been linked to the recent killing of a Border Patrol Officer in Nogales, AZ.\\"  Chronicle and development of Project Gunwalker  In response to pressures by Mike Vanderboegh, ATF Special Agents Vince A. Cefalu and Jay Dobyns, among others, Senator Charles E. Grassley (IA) initiated an investigation with a letter to ATF on 27 January 2011, and again on 31 January 2011. ATF responded through the Department of Justice by denying all allegations. Senator Grassley responded with specific documentation supporting the allegations in letters to U.S. Attorney General Holder on 9 Feb 2011 and 16 Feb 2011. ATF refused to answer specific questions in a formal briefing to Senator Grassley on 10 Feb 2011. Indictments filed in federal court, documentation obtained by Senator Grassley, and statements of ATF agents obtained by Senator Grassley and CBS News, show that the ATF Phoenix Field Division allegedly allowed and facilitated the sale of over 2,500 firearms (AK-47 rifles, FN 5.7mm pistols, AK-47 pistols, and .50 caliber rifles) in 'straw man purchases' likely destined for Mexico. According to ATF agents, Mexican officials were not notified, and ATF agents operating in Mexico were instructed not to alert Mexican authorities about the operation. Some ATF agents and supervisors strongly objected, and gun dealers (who were cooperating with ATF) protested the sales, but were asked by ATF to complete the transactions, purportedly to expose the supply chain and gather intelligence. Many of these same guns are being recovered from crime scenes in Arizona and throughout Mexico, which is artificially inflating ATF's eTrace statistics of U.S. origin guns seized in Mexico. One specific gun, an SKS rifle recovered at the scene, is alleged to be the weapon used to murder Customs and Border Protection Agent Brian Terry on 14 December 2010. Operation Gunwalker has already had deadly consequences with the death of Agent Terry, and countless other murders in Mexico. A less obvious (intended?) consequence is the artificial inflation of ATF's eTrace 'statistics' which will show thousands more U.S. origin guns seized in Mexico - thanks to Operation Gunwalker. The dealers encouraged by ATF to complete sales to traffickers will be penalized with each trace which will show them as the selling dealer of 'crime guns' and may cause them to be labeled as \\"Criminal Friendly FFL\\" by ATF. \\"Criminal Friendly FFL\\" dealers are subject to more intense scrutiny by ATF Investigators during annual inspections, which could result in loss of their license.  Mexican police corruption  The Mexican Army recently (see citations) disarmed corrupt Mexican police in the cities of Tijuana, Cancun, Rosarito, Nuevo Laredo, Reynosa and Matamoros \\\\- and arrested a number of police commanders in Mexico City. Yet, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), during FY 2007 and 2008, ATF conducted twelve eTrace training sessions for Mexican police (over 961 Mexican police officers) in several Mexican cities, including the same cities where corrupt police were disarmed and arrested: Mexico City, Tijuana, Nuevo Laredo, and Matamoros. Despite the GAO report, ATF now claims (October 2010) only about 20 people have been trained to use eTrace in Mexico. This discrepancy has not been explained. According to Mexican and U.S. government officials, extensive corruption at the federal, state, and local levels of Mexican law enforcement impedes U.S. efforts to develop effective and dependable partnerships with Mexican government entities in combating arms trafficking. Mexican federal authorities are implementing anticorruption measures, but government officials acknowledge fully implementing these reforms will take considerable time, and may take years to affect comprehensive change. According to Mexican government officials, corruption pervades all levels of Mexican law enforcement — federal, state and local. Almost half of Mexican police officers examined during 2008 failed background and security tests, a figure that rises to nearly 9 of 10 police agents in the border state of Baja California. Additional reports indicate the Mexican Army may be just as corrupt as the Mexican Police. Nothing can prevent corrupt or incompetent police (foreign or U.S.) from making false, phony or fraudulent traces and retrieving gun owner personal information for their own purposes. “An alleged trafficker in the X Caliber case, Fidel Hernandez, told investigators at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives [ATF] that he was “selling the guns to people who were ‘cops’ in Mexico.” According to ATF’s report, “At this location, approximately one mile inside Mexico, Hernandez would meet with the Mexican police officers, who were in uniform. Hernandez said the officers would pay him for the guns, which he had inside the bags.”\\" See also *Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) *Project Gunrunner *National Tracing Center *Mexico Drug War *Firearm Owners Protection Act *Gun politics in Mexico References External links * United States Department of State Category:United States federal firearms law Category:Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ","title":"ETrace"},{"id":"26185278","text":"Fiachra Finn, 3rd king of Uí Maine, fl. 5th-century.
