Crull was born in Boston, MA, but lived in Seattle until 1976, after which he moved to Los Angeles to embark on his professional career. While still an art student at the University of Washington, he won many prizes at local arts festivals, and was the youngest ever artist to be invited to show at the Northwest Art Annual. Considered a precocious talent, Crull joined Foster White Gallery, one of Seattle's premier at galleries where he had several exhibitions before graduating university. From 1976 to 1983 Crull's paintings focused on organic, biomorphic shapes on white backgrounds, a gestational period for the artist that expressed in a pure abstract manner with impasto like surfaces. He joined the Stella Polaris Gallery in 1983, where he met art critic and writer Edward Goldman, and host of KCRW's ‚ÄúArt Talk.‚Äù Goldman championed Crull's works, which were acquired by corporate art collections, and was also instrumental in Crull's first significant non-gallery show at the USC Fisher Museum of Art (then, the Fisher Gallery) at the University of Southern California. In 1983 Crull relocated to New York City, and became a seminal figure in the East Village art scene. He was discovered by Colin de Land, founder of Vox Populi, and the Armory Art Show. Crull had several shows at the Vox Populi, a time marked also by commercial success, and national recognition for the artist. Crull's works were acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art,Ford Crull, Metropolitan Museum of Art catalog (accessed 01-05-2018) the Brooklyn Museum,Ford Crull, Brooklyn Museum catalog (accessed 01-05-2018) the National Gallery of Art, and the Dayton Art Institute. In 1989, Crull was part of the very first showing of American artists in the USSR, Painting Beyond the Death of Painting at the Kuznetsky Most Exhibition Hall in Moscow curated by American art critic and historian, Donald Kuspit. This coincided with the time Crull was influenced by the Philosophy of Dualism. Upon his return from Russia, Crull began using steel framing for his paintings, with the edges burned. It was an invention that came to him after seeing the ancient icons in Russia. The new works were titled, ‚ÄúRelic Series‚Äù. In a 1994 interview on the artist's work at Howard Scott Gallery in NYC noted art critic Eleanor Heartney stated,\\"The key to Crull‚Äôs vision is his simultaneous embrace of the uncertainties of the contemporary world and his affirmation of the reality of the individual consciousness within it. In his work, the authentic self remains the last bulwark against an anarchic world.\\" From 2006 - 2010, Crull made several visits to Shanghai, China, culminating in the first of his subsequent interdisciplinary live art works. At the opening of the Bund 1919 art bank, a cultural and art enclave developed from five 1919 buildings at Shanghai No. 8 Cotton and Textile Factory, Crull executed a public art project to a live performance of pianist Shi Wen.

The farm is operated by the non-profit Gorman Heritage Farm Foundation, whose mission is to educate visitors about agriculture, nutrition, sustainability, and the environment. The farm is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Brown‚ÄìGorman Farm. History The farm was started by Edward Brown, an immigrant from Scotland, who built the main barn in 1835 and later moved to Illinois. His cousin, George Brown, took over the farm. It was eventually handed down to Jim and Dorothy Gorman in 1943. In 1996, the Cincinnati Nature Center took ownership of the farm and converted it into an outdoor educational facility. The main barn was turned into an interpretive center. The Nature Center turned the farm over to the Village of Evendale, which established the Gorman Heritage Farm Foundation. In 2012, the entire farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Brown‚ÄìGorman Farm, owing to its historically significant architecture.

It is found in the Caribbean and North America. Description =Adult= The beetle is long and is yellow to bright red with black spots. It is one of the largest leaf beetles native to North America. The name Argus comes from the mythical Greek giant Argus Panoptes, who was sometimes depicted with 100 eyes, because the beetle is able to stretch out its red head beyond its pronotum, as if it were a single red eye. The species resembles a small turtle and is similar to a ladybug. =Egg, larva, and pupa= Larvae with fecal shields The Argus tortoise beetle lays eggs on leaves, in clusters of 15 to 30. The eggs hatch within 10 days. Its larvae are yellowish-green or orange-yellow. The larvae feed on leaves until they are fully grown, then they drop to the soil to pupate, overwintering as pupae before emerging as adults in the middle of summer. It takes them almost three weeks to become pupae. Habitat The beetle can be found throughout North America in meadows and roadsides. It can also be found in the Caribbean. It feeds on the foliage of plants, including milkweed, raspberry, maize, and sweet potato. It can defoliate entire plants. One plant that it feeds on is the morning glory, which has leaves that are protected by alkaloids. Some alkaloids can poison nerves and can be deadly to people and animals. It is possible that the beetle stores the alkaloids in its body to protect itself from predators. Predators Predators of the beetle include the hymenopteran egg parasite Emersonella niveipes, the tachinid larval parasite Masicera exilis, and the predatory stink bug Apateticus bracteatus.

In 2016, Miss Krystle officially launched Delgado Entertainment Law, PLLC, an entertainment law firm based in Scottsdale, Arizona. People analogize Miss Krystle to being a superhero: lawyer by day, musician by night, but Miss Krystle says that music will always be her No. 1 passion, priority, and chosen career. In 2017, Miss Krystle independently released her Inevitable EP through Dukes Up Records, produced and co-written by That Orko. The Inevitable EP was mixed by Jason Goldstein, and mastered by Reuben Cohen with Lurssen Mastering. Some of the notable remixes from that album include Dukes Up (Andy Gerold Remix), a former Marilyn Manson member. In March 2018, Miss Krystle landed air play on 93.3 Alt Az Radio station for her single, \\"Relevant\\" and additionally showcased at SXSW as an SXSW approved artist. Miss Krystle has covered classic songs like \\"God Only Knows\\" by The Beach Boys (2018), \\"Cruel Summer\\" by Bananarama (2016), and \\"Soon We‚Äôll Be Found\\" by Sia (2015). Her new single \\"Save Yourself\\" is due out in Fall 2018, and will be an exploration of her Aggropop sound. Miss Krystle's sound is currently described as aggressive pop, but critics report her songs could easily find a home in any club or favorite Top 40 radio station. Miss Krystle Symbol The tattoo on Miss Krystle's left ribs is the official Miss Krystle symbol, which is a number of straight lines, intersecting at a singular point. Miss Krystle says she would draw this symbol on her wrist during law school as a ritual, in instances of extreme stress, as a reminder to take a refreshed perspective.https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/55707069/javajuly2016 She says Tony Robbins inspired this \\"minimalizing\\" method, and says the symbol reminds her that she is in control of her reality.  Philanthropy and charity  Miss Krystle began a 501(c)3 child abuse prevention and awareness charitable organization in 2006, Young Ones United, at the age of 16. The charity continues to provide support to children and families in Arizona today.  Vegan lifestyle  Miss Krystle became vegan in 2013. She says she was suffering from chronic fatigue and extreme digestive issues for years prior, and although she had seen a multitude of doctors and specialists, no one could figure out what was wrong. Miss Krystle says that when she switched to an all plant-based diet, her chronic fatigue and digestive issues disappeared in one week. Miss Krystle promotes a no calorie restriction, high carb lifestyle that focuses on maintaining a healthy metabolism. Miss Krystle notes that she finally made the switch to a vegan lifestyle after discovering the \\"Raw Till 4\\" lifestyle and nutritional program started by vegan activist, Freelee the Banana Girl. In 2018, Miss Krystle started Cookin‚Äô Vegan with Miss Krystle YouTube series, where she shares her vegan recipes with viewers.

Modus operandi  Legoretta's modus operandi was to take advantage of his job as a driver on Route 2 that runs from Metro Chapultepec to Tlalnepantla de Baz, where late at night and early in the morning he would rape and kill women aged between 17 and 34. To commit his act, he simulated that his vehicle had broken down; he would then drop off all the passengers except one girl, then offered to take her outside if she wanted to help fix the problem, but before arriving at the place he would change the route, rape the girl and kill her afterwards, dropping her body in the Tlalnepantla channel. Sometimes this method would vary, since the victim would be the last passenger before arriving at the destination.  Capture and evasion  C√©sar Armando Librado Legorreta, \\"El Coqueto\\", is 31 years old, lived in the municipality of Tultitl√°n with his wife and two children, worked as a driver on Route 2 through public transport driving a minibus with registration 712TL066, where he committed his murders. According to the investigation folder that was made after his capture and trial, his first crime was committed on July 14, 2011; his second on November 26; his third on December 13 and his fourth on the 30th. His last two murders were committed in December 8 and 18, 2012, respectively. Initially he was captured on February 26 in the Federal District, and was arrested and transferred to the facilities of the Deputy Attorney General's Office, based in Barrientos de la Vega. He was connected to eight feminicides committed in the Metropolitan Area, where the killer was driving a minibus that ran from Valle Dorado to Chapultepec, but he evaded the facilities of the Attorney General's Office of the State of Mexico. The authorities offered a million pesos for information leading to the arrest of Librado Legoretta. Finally, on March 3, 2012, agents of Magdalena Contreras borough learned his location. With the reforms to the Penal Code of the State of Mexico at the end of the year 2011, if convicted, it would be the first case of life imprisonment for feminicide and rape in Mexico.  The escape of 'El Coqueto'  C√©sar Armando escaped from the Deputy Attorney General of Tlalnepantla; After the PGJEM reported that he had been arrested for multiple homicides and rapes over the weekend, early morning Armando eloped with the help of his guards, state prosecutor Alfredo Castillo confirmed. He explained that by not having the figure of arraigo, detainees can only be cared for but without violating their individual guarantees, so in any oversight, such as this case, they can escape. He explained that in the early hours of Sunday morning to Monday, the agent of Public Ministry realized that both the detainee and the three ministerial policemen were not in the facilities. After the release of the news, the police started tracking them down. \\"This Tuesday at dawn one of the three ministerial policemen was arrested, saying that upon realizing that this person had jumped off out of a window and knowing they would be blamed, they fled as not to be detained\\", Castillo Cervantes said. Despite the error, the prosecutor said that in the next few hours Armando will be arrested because his arrest was after months of investigation, so \\"we have it perfectly located, now it will be easier to stop him\\". He said that they discharged the ministerial policemen for negligence and attempting to flee. Finally, on Saturday, March 3, 2012, agents of the Attorney General's Office of the State of Mexico in Magdalena Contreras recaptured Armando.  Sentence  On December 12, 2012, Legoretta was convicted and sentenced to 240 years in prison for the rape and murder of six women.

It covers all three main dimensions of economic globalization, cultural globalization, and political globalization. The concept first arose in the 2011 work by Dani Rodrik, an economist and professor of International Political Economy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, who described it in The Globalization Paradox. Rodrik criticized the state of globalization, questioning the wisdom of unlimited economic integration beyond national borders. He sees a conflict between the workings of the nation state and free flow economic globalization that has gone too far \\"toward an impractical version that we might call hyperglobalization\\". In 2013, economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Arvind Subramanian and Martin Kessler invoked the concept in \\"The Hyperglobalization of Trade and Its Future\\", to describe the dramatic increase in world trade that has occurred since the founding of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. Public Relations consultant and academician, Takashi Inoue extended the concept to beyond the economics into the realms of culture and politics in his 2018 book Public Relations in Hyper- Globalization; He argues that the world is being transformed by three forces of hyper-globalization: economic, social media, and new disruptive technologies that together are accelerating the pace of change in all spheres. Inoue argues that this is the new reality in which leaders must now operate in.  Hyper-globalization as globalization gone too far  Dani Rodrik defines hyper-globalization as a type of globalization aimed at the elimination of all transaction costs associated with the movement between the natural borders of nation states of goods, services, capital and finance. These costs are not limited to just tariffs and quotas, but also includes things such as domestic regulations, standards, rules on product safety, rules on intellectual property, and banking regulations. In other words, Rodrik sees hyper-globalization as a type of globalization that allows multinational companies to avoid the rules and regulations of nation states. The deep integration of hyper-globalization conflicts with and threatens the sovereignty of the nation state. Rodrik concludes that hyper-globalization is globalization that has gone too far. He rejects the solution of using intergovernmental organizations as a way to provide governance, because by definition that requires nation states to give up sovereignty and thus it is not compatible with democracy. He does not argue to stop or reduce globalization, but rather to change the rules of globalization away from hyper-globalization to activity that does not conflict with national sovereignty.  Hyper-globalization‚Äôs origins, its size, scope and velocity  Subramanian and Kessler argue that the world is now in an era of \\"hyper- globalization, where world trade has soared much more rapidly than world GDP\\". They note that in the period since the late 1990s, there was a surge in economic activity in the developing world. Prior to the late 1990s, only 30 percent of the developing world or 21 countries out of 72 were catching up to the United States as the economic frontier, but since the late 1990s that number jumped nearly 75 percent or 75 out of 103 countries. The rate at which convergence with the U.S. was occurring jumped from 1.5 percent per capita per year to 3.3 percent per capita after the late 1990s. They call the period between 1870 and 1914 the Golden Age of globalization in which world trade in terms of GDP went from a 9 percent to 16 percent share. However, in the current age of hyper-globalization, which includes both goods and services, the GDP share has reached 33 percent.They explain that China, which gained entry into the WTO in 2001, has become the world's sole mega-trader. At the height of the Golden Age of globalization in 1913 Great Britain was the world's megatrader with its share of GDP of 18.5 percent. In contrast, China's share of GDP has reached 50%.  Three forces of hyper-globalization  Takashi Inoue describes three forces of hyper-globalization: (1) Economic force in which extensive growth in global trade creates cross-border economic integration, (2) Human communications force via the Internet in which instant and global communication of social media and the Internet are changing norms of human communication blurring social barriers, and (3) Technological disruption force coming from new innovations in technology driven by Internet- of-Things (IoT), big data, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) bringing massive economic and rapid social changes leading to a world of Singularity. His main argument is that these three forces are creating a new reality for which global leaders must now be proficient in stakeholder relationship management of strategic public relations.

Geology  This volcanic field lies northeast of Hoggar. Volcanism in northern Africa, such as in Darfur, Hoggar and Tibesti, has variously been proposed to be due to mantle plumes, reactivated tectonic lineaments in the crust and several more geologic mechanisms. In Hoggar, after Cenozoic uplift, volcanism peaked in the Miocene after an Eocene start and continued to this day. The field has also produced lapilli, lava bombs and melilitic rocks which contain xenoliths. Minerals found at In Teria include granite, granulite, garnet and spinel peridotite, phlogopite, phlogopitite and pyroxenite. These xenoliths have interacted with melts and testify to the presence of old, thick lithosphere.  Eruption history  The field was emplaced during the Quaternary, with possible Holocene activity.

He previously worked with the University of the West Indies, Caribbean Policy Development Centre, Commonwealth of Nations, Caribbean Community, and the City and Guilds of London Institute. Hewitt has been a strong advocate for the Commonwealth of Nations and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) particularly for a change in the OECD Development Assistance Committee rules to allow Caribbean and other SIDS to access development financing when devastated by catastrophic storm systems. In 2016, to celebrate Barbados' Fiftieth Anniversary of Independence he published Fathering A Nation on the life and legacy of Errol Barrow, the first Prime Minister of Barbados and one of the Barbadian National Heroes. He previous wrote extensively on gender responsive national budgets. In 2018, he was one of the leading advocates on the Windrush scandal, in which he criticised the outcomes of the immigration policies of the British government on undocumented, elderly, West Indian-born, long-term UK residents which included the denial of the right to work, denial of benefits, denial of healthcare and also for some detention and deportation. He published articles with Chatham House and the University of the West Indies on the Windrush scandal in which he outlines the strategy adopted to make the Windrush scandal a national concern and global issue and bring about a major policy u-turn. Hewitt's agitation was included in the podcast series 100 Campaigns that Changed the World. In addition to his assignment to the Court of St James, Hewitt was the Permanent Representative to the UN International Maritime Organization, and a Governor on the Board of the Commonwealth Secretariat. He has also published a number of books and as an Anglican priest has ministered in Barbados and the wider Caribbean, the UK, North America and Europe. He is currently based in Southeast Florida.

A former criminal, he has since undergone a personal transformation towards advocacy for animal liberation and veganism, through social media and public speaking engagements, as well as debates and various televised interviews.  Personal life  Carbstrong was born Joseph Armstrong in Adelaide, Australia. He has publicly stated that before his fame he was involved in substance abuse and crime. He became a vegan after his release from incarceration. He has a ‚ÄúVegan‚Äù tattoo behind his right ear. At the age of 14, he had left school and developed a heavy drug addiction. He had various blue collar jobs before receiving welfare at age 22. By this point he had gained a lengthy criminal record which included three assaults. He spent 18 months under house arrest. An arrest in September 2011 was the result of police discovering a concealed, loaded shotgun which Armstrong was bringing to a drug deal. Multiple weapons and additional ammunition in his hotel room were also discovered and he spent six months in jail. In May 2017, he released a video to celebrate his completion of four years being sober.  Animal rights advocacy  Carbstrong has been involved in animal rights street activism in Australia, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom, promoting groups such as Anonymous for the Voiceless and the Save Movement, an organization that holds vigils outside slaughterhouses and promotes veganism by sharing images and footage from farms and slaughterhouses on social media. During one protest against a slaughterhouse in Spennymoor, he stated, \\"Slaughterhouses are usually on the outskirts of towns and hidden away.

Lutheran art consists of all religious art produced for Lutherans and the Lutheran Churches. This includes sculpture, painting, and architecture. Artwork in the Lutheran Churches arose as a distinct marker of the faith during the Reformation era and attempted to illustrate, supplement and portray in tangible form the teachings of Lutheran theology.  Reformation era  Law and Gospel, by Lutheran painter Lucas Cranach the Elder and Lucas Cranach the Younger (1536). Martin Luther encouraged the display of some religious imagery in churches, seeing the Evangelical Lutheran Church as a continuation of the \\"ancient, apostolic church\\". He defended the use of \\"importance of images as tools for instruction and aids to devotion\\", stating that \\"If it is not a sin but good to have the image of Christ in my heart, why should it be a sin to have it in my eyes?\\"Noble, 67-69 His attitude towards images became more positive after his dispute with Andreas Karlstadt began in 1521. Luther had left Karlstadt in effective charge of his church in Wittenberg when he went into retreat in the Wartburg, but Karlstadt introduced a considerably more Radical Reformation than Luther approved, which included the removal of all religious images from churches. As with the later Calvinist programmes of complete destruction of images, this aroused more popular opposition than other aspects of the radical innovations, and Luther's support for images was in part an attempt to distinguish his positions from more radical ones, as well as an attempt to avoid stirring up opposition over an issue he did not see as central. Luther also understood the value of crude polemical woodcuts in the propaganda battle, and commissioned some himself. He also appears to have worked personally with artists to develop didactic compositions that were used as book frontispieces, including for the Luther Bible which had an elaborate frontispiece in all early editions, prints, and relatively small versions in oils. Law and Gospel (1529) by the Lutheran painter Lucas Cranach the Elder is the earliest painting of this type,Noble, 1, 12-14 on the extent of Cranach's \\"Lutheranism\\" in the early years painted in different versions, and turned into a woodcut. Several share a similar composition, divided vertically into two by a tree, also found in many polemical prints; typically there is a good side and a bad side. Lutheran catechisms, an important means of disseminating Lutheran teachings among the congregations, were often illustrated with woodcuts, as were prayerbooks and other religious literature.Heal (2017), 33-38 In the beginning of Lutheranism's spread to German territories in the 1520s and 1530s, local ordinances set out a variety of treatments of existing imagery in churches. Where, as was sometimes the case, nothing was said, it is presumed that it was intended that many images could be retained. In the Lutheran churches of Nuremberg, for example, \\"side altars, sacrament houses and saints' shrines provided (and continue to provide) the visual backdrop for evangelical worship\\".Heal (2017), 46 Elsewhere, depending on the views of the ruler or council, all images were to be removed, as in Hesse in 1526, although Martin Luther objected to this decision, apparently ineffectively.Heal (2017), 43-45. \\"In Hesse, for example, the Homberg Synod that met in 1526 at the behest of Landgrave Phillip made no concessions with regard to images: all should be removed, whatever the status and subject matter. Although Luther objected to the conclusions reached by this synod, Phillip again decreed the removal of images in 1527.\\" Some ordinances specified that only \\"images near and before which particular worship and idolatry and special honour with candles and lights have been practiced\\" should be removed but also emphasized that \\"we may not be iconoclasts\\", in the words of a Hamburg ordinance of 1529.Heal (2017), 43-44 In Brandenburg, an injunction was pronounced to retain 'altars...images and paintings' and in W√ºrttemberg, images that were neglected or damaged were restored or replaced.Heal (2017), 52 The Augsburg Interim and Leipzig Interim settled the issue, both pronouncing that sacred art would be preserved in the Lutheran Churches, though they would not be the focal point of worship, thus making the Lutheran position a via media between what Lutheran theologians perceived as 'Roman Catholic idolatry' and 'Calvinist iconoclasm'.Heal (2017), 51 A few Lutheran altarpieces, including those of the Last Supper, were commissioned under the purview of Martin Luther. The Schneeberg Altarpiece was placed at the high altar of St. Wolfgang im Salzkammergut and as Lutheran sacred imagery, reflected \\"the devotional forms of fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century northern art\\". The Schneeberg Altarpiece (1539), along with the Wittenberg Altarpiece (1547) and the Weimar Altarpiece (1555), were Christocentric in their iconography and \\"these altarpieces reinforced the key teachings of the new church and helped consolidate a sense of confessional identity.\\" In eastern Germany, Lutheran patrons erected some thirty new altarpieces. Most pre-Reformation altarpieces were preserved within Lutheran churches as the \\"altar was still believed to be a particularly holy place, and should be adorned accordingly.\\" Lutheran sacred art gained a new function in addition to exciting one's mind to thoughts of the Divine by also serving a didactic purpose. Cranach's Law and Gospel, for example, \\"enshrines the specific authority of the word of the Bible by including biblical passages as prominent parts of the composition.\\" Lutheranism was responsible for \\"an explosion of creativity in the graphic arts\\" with works such as Passional Christi und Antichristi by Philipp Melanchthon, being described as \\"richly illustrated\\". The Lutheran Mass depicted in the Nikolaikirche in Berlin, Martin Schulz, 1615. Daniel Hisgen's paintings are mostly cycles on the parapets of Lutheran church galleries. Here the Creation (left) to the Annunciation can be seen. With respect to the Divine Service, \\"Lutheran worship became a complex ritual choreography set in a richly furnished church interior.\\" Ornate church interiors in Lutheran churches reflected Lutheran Eucharistic theology, which taught the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist as a sacramental union.Lamport, 138. \\"Lutherans continued to worship in pre-Reformation churches, generally with few alterations to the interior. It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. Joseph Leo Koerner has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. \\"An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments\\" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: \\"You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return\\" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's theologia crucis. ... In contrast, Reformed (Calvinist) churches are strikingly different. Usually unadorned and somewhat lacking in aesthetic appeal, pictures, sculptures, and ornate altar- pieces are largely absent; there are few or no candles; and crucifixes or crosses are also mostly absent. Lutheran churches, as well as homes, displayed a prominent crucifix as it highlighted their high view of the Theology of the Cross. It became a popular devotional image for Lutherans, who \\"prayed, meditated, and even wept before them.\\" Thus, for Lutherans, \\"the Reformation renewed rather than removed the religious image.\\" During the Beeldenstorm or Iconoclastic Fury, bands often categorized as Calvinists violently removed sacred art from churches.Arnade, Peter J., Beggars, Iconoclasts, and Civic Patriots: the Political Culture of the Dutch Revolt, pp. 97-142, Cornell University Press, 2008, , Lutherans generally opposed the iconoclasm, one saying: \\"You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return\\". As such, Calvinist iconoclasm, \\"provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs\\" in Germany. Lutheran theologian and priest Johann Arndt was forced to flee Anhalt when it became Calvinist in the 1580s, due to his defense of Christian sacred art. He wrote a treatise Ikonographia, in which he criticized the Reformed faith for consecrating the Eucharistic elements on wooden tables rather than on stone altars. As Calvinism, along with its associated aniconism spread, \\"Lutherans responded by reaffirming their commitment to the proper use of religious images.\\"  Baroque period  Lutheran Church of Our Lady, by Adolf von Donndorf. (1885) Mosaic depicting Christ the Almighty, ceiling within Ascension Church the Lutheran Ascension Church at Augusta Victoria Foundation, Jerusalem Artists who designed Lutheran Baroque art not only took their inspiration from Martin Luther, but from popular Lutheran piety in the latter part of the 16th and 17th centuries. The Dresden Frauenkirche serves as a prominent example of Lutheran Baroque art, which was completed in 1743 after being commissioned by the Lutheran city council of Dresden: In the second half of the 17th century, high baroque art continued to spread through Saxony, under the rule of Johann Georg II. Pieces like the altar of Johanneskirche resembled the Descent from the Cross by Peter Paul Rubens. More typically, Daniel Hisgen (1733-1812) was a German painter of the rococo period who worked as a painter of Lutheran churches in Upper Hesse, specializing on cycles of paintings decorating the front of the gallery parapet in churches with an upper gallery. His discreet cycles demonstrate the modest prominence expected of Lutheran art in German churches of his day, taking a middle route between the large and prominent images in Catholic churches, and the complete absence of images in Calvinist ones.  19th century  Gothic Revival Lutheran church in Bautzen, Saxony. In the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Denmark, several Lutheran altarpieces were designed and housed within parish churches. Many of these were designed by artists such as Carl Bloch and Joakim Skovgaard.  Present day  With respect to artwork adorning Lutheran churches in the modern era: Within the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Denmark, religious artists including Arne Haugen S√∏rensen, Peter Brandes, Hein Heinsen and Maja Lisa Engelhardt continue to design Lutheran art today. It has been claimed that more pre-Reformation Marian altarpieces survive in German Lutheran churches than Catholic ones, where many were replaced in the Baroque period.

Flathead motorcycles have side-valve contained within the engine block, instead of in the cylinder head, as in an overhead valve engine. This early engine design has mostly fallen into disuse.However, flatheads are currently experiencing a revival in low-revving aero-enginessuch as the D-MotorD-Motor image Cleveland Model 4-45 In 1925 Cleveland Motorcycle Manufacturing Company released a motorcycle with a T-head four-cylinder engine designed by L. E. Fowler. Harley-Davidson flatheads Indian Chief Black Hawk Harley-Davidson flathead engine BMW R12 =Model W, singles, and 45s (DL, RL, and WL)= The flathead engine saw service in Harley-Davidson motorcycles beginning with the Model W's flat-twin, produced from 1919 to 1923, and continuing in 1924 with single-cylinder export-model and singles and continued in Servi-Cars until 1973. In the domestic U.S. market, the (primary VIN letter) D model (1929 to 1931) and its technical descendant, the (primary VIN letter) R model (1932 to 1936), started Harley's side-valve tradition in the 45-cubic-inch displacement class. The D and R models featured a total-loss oiling system and were succeeded in 1937 by the (primary VIN letter) W 45, which had recirculating oil lubrication. The WLA (W = return oil, L = performance, A = army) went on to serve in World War II as the U.S. and Canadian Army's WLC (C = Canada) primary two-wheeled mount and subsequently as a civilian middleweight through 1952. The engine continued virtually unchanged with 2.745\\" bore and 3.8125\\" stroke with various G-based designations in the three-wheeled Servi-Car until production ceased in 1973. =K-series and developments= In 1952, the K series flatheads was introduced with the same bore and stroke, selling in parallel with the W series (which was discontinued after 1952), designed to compete with British sporting motorcycles of the time. The K models featured a 750cc unit construction engine and transmission case, right side foot shift and left side foot brake. From 1954 to 1956, the KH received an increase in stroke to 4-9/16\\" to bring displacement to 888cc (54 cubic inches). The K series was replaced by the overhead valve Sportster series in the retail market in 1957. The American Motorcycle Association (AMA) class C rules of 1952 allowed sidevalves of 750cc to compete against 500cc overhead valve bikes. The 750cc KR factory racer was highly competitive in dirt track and road racing, and was produced in limited numbers until 1969, when the AMA changed the rules by increasing the Class C displacement limit to 750 cc. Without the displacement advantage, the KR flatheads were not competitive against 750 cc overhead valve bikes. =Flathead big twins= In 1930, the VL flathead replaced the JD Big Twin, which had featured intake-over-exhaust (IoE) valve configuration. The VL had a single downtube frame and total loss oiling, culminating in an version (VLH) in 1935. In 1937, that engine was redesigned to include a recirculating lubrication system, and designated the model U, and it went into the same frame and running gear configuration as the model E Knucklehead, which had originated in 1936. The U continued to be produced in varying configurations as a 74 cubic inch U & UL (1937 to 1948), and 80 cubic inch UH & ULH engine (1937 to 1941). By 1948, the first year of the aluminum-head Panhead, it had been thoroughly superseded and outsold in the marketplace by the superior performance of the overhead valve model Big Twins.

Everyone that paid a minimum of $1 had the opportunity to vote on 25 concept ideas from employees. After the completion of the voting period, the top two picks were developed into prototypes. In addition, Tim Schafer chose an additional prototype, and the Double Fine Productions staff that was working on Amnesia Fortnight chose another. This was done to give the team a bit of control, rather than have all of the choices be as a result of online voting. Double Fine developed these four concept ideas from employees into game prototypes that became available to those that purchased the bundle after they were completed. In addition, fan projects were also included this year. Three fan pitches were presented in a video and everyone that paid a minimum of $1 could choose between the three pitches. All three games, Pongball, Amnesia Adventure and The Lost Dev Team were developed into prototypes by fans. The top choice, Pongball, was included with the Amnesia Fortnight downloads. 2 Player Productions filmed a documentary about the making of the prototypes, which was also released on YouTube. I Have No Idea What I'm Doing I Have No Idea What I'm Doing, was Tim Schafer's choice. It is a multi-player virtual reality party game that was led by Zak McClendon. One player wears the headset, and the players not wearing the headset play using the standard display. Kiln Kiln, led by Darek Brand, was the Double Fine Productions team's choice.

It is found in North America. These two subspecies belong to the species Listronotus oregonensis: *Listronotus oregonensis oregonensis (LeConte, 1857) *Listronotus oregonensis tessellatus Casey, 1895 *  Pest status  This species was first recognized as a pest in 1902 on parsley in Virginia. It mainly attacks cultivated Apiaceae species such as parsley, carrot, celery and dill. By feeding on the root, larvae of the carrot weevil cause direct damage to the vegetable, causing yield losses of up to 50%.  Life cycle  Adult carrot weevil, Listronotus oregonensis Carrot weevil adults spend the winter in a quiescent state, hiding in the top five centimeters of soil and in weed, grass and debris left in the field, or in field borders. In spring, the female lays her eggs in a cavity that she digs at the base of the petiole of the carrot leaf. The larva passes through four larval stages that will form tunnels through the carrot to feed. The last larval stage leaves the host plant to form the pupa in the soil, from which an adult will emerge a few days later. The carrot weevil performs between one and three generations per year depending on the latitude. However, under unfavorable conditions, this species will undergo a reproductive diapause that delays egg-laying behavior until the following spring.  Pest management  Because this pest has a very low migration capacity, moving mainly by walking, control is made mainly through crop rotation. Insecticide applications that target the adult stage may be necessary when the population density is high. The monitoring of the overwintering generation of adults using carrot-baited traps is an effective means of assessing the level of infestation and predicting the need for insecticide treatments. Several natural enemies such as micro-organisms, nematodes, predatory insects and parasitoids can attack the carrot weevil. The eggs of the weevil are mainly attacked by parasitoids that are naturally present in the environment, especially by the species Anaphes victus and A. listronoti. Smaller species of ground beetles, such as Bembidion quadrimaculatum and Clivina fossor, can also attack weevil eggs. In addition, pupae that are found under the ground and adults that move on the litter are mainly attacked by larger ground beetles The nematode Bradynema listronotii has the ability to inhibit the reproductive system of the female, reducing the oviposition on host plants.
