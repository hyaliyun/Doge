It is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 31787. The mill is to the south of the Westfriesedijk (part of the Westfriese Omringdijk) just outside Aartswoud. It is owned by Stichting de Westfriese Molens. History The mill is probably the oldest of its type in North Holland, dating to c. 1541\\\\. It was one of 24 mills that drained water from the Vier Noorder Koggen into the Zuiderzee The mills drained an area of . In 1869, a steam-powered pumping station was built in Medemblik. It drove two Archimedes' screws and two scoopwheels. These were replaced by centrifugal pumps in 1897. Following the replacement of the steam engines by gas engines in 1908, it was decided to abandon the use of wind power in the area. Two of the mills were converted to residential use, and the others were demolished. One of the two conversions was later demolished, leaving Westuit Nr. 7 as the sole survivor. In 1990, it was decided that the mill should be restored. By 1997, it had been restored externally and was able to turn in the wind. Restoration of the internal machinery was completed in 2009, and the mill was again able to pump water. This is done on a closed-circuit basis. The mill is listed as a Rijksmonument, No. 31787. Description Westuit Nr. 7 is a three-storey smock mill on a single-storey base. The smock and cap are thatched. The cap carries four common sails of span. They are carried on a cast iron windshaft, which was cast in 1875 by De Prins van Oranje, Den Haag. Winding is by an internal winch. The mill drives a wooden Archimedes' screw.

In traditional rituals, infant body parts are claimed to bring benefits. Those who continue these practices describe it as \\"mercy killing\\", meaning that the children are spared from enduring painful disabilities. Rituals =Process= Most of the time, a witch doctor will resort to these rituals to save the disabled children from their painful disability after the failure of multiple attempts using other methods that include herbal remedies or animal sacrifices which are less powerful. During the rituals of child sacrifice, the witch doctor is in presence of his accomplices and starts by verifying any evidence of demonization in the child. Then, he removes different parts of the child‚Äôs body by force and uses the blood to make a potion mixed with herbs. These body parts are mostly heads, genitals, eyes, tongues, limbs, teeth, and organs. According to the perpetrators, these rituals are necessary to bring about success, healing or wealth. =Practitioners= The ‚Äòkilling‚Äô of disabled children in Uganda is perpetrated by witchdoctors who praise the power of these rituals to their clients in search of wealth, health or fame. Those witchdoctors are often compared to traditional healers which have resulted in the propaganda stating that witchcraft is associated with the healing practices of the indigenous culture although they are, in reality, responsible of horrible crimes unlike traditional healers who do not use human organs. The parents of disabled children also play a major role in the rituals by allowing it and leading their children to death because they believe that the so-called ‚Äòmercy killing‚Äô would avoid them the pain of enduring these disabilities. Investigations The parliament of Uganda highly condemns \\"mercy\\" killing of newborn disabled children in Uganda as they regard it as an inhumane act. =Findings= The European Parliament was involved in finding resolutions for the killings of disabled people in Uganda. They argued that the killings should not take place because: human rights should be respected at all times, everyone has a right to life despite their disabilities. People with disabilities are often excluded from community activities. Disabled children are usually hidden from the public, cast out, and even killed. Mothers of these children experience isolation from their extended families, while most of the fathers neglect their families. The Ugandan National Household Survey reports only record disabled people of age 5 and above; leaving out most children. 7.1% of Ugandans, which is equivalent to 2.1 million people are reported to be disabled. =Actions and penalties= In Uganda, the law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities in employment, education, air travel and other transportation, access to health care, and the provision of other state services. However, the government's efforts in enforcing these laws have not been effective. The form of treatment given to people with disability has not been encouraging of late. A July report released by the National Council on Disability (NCD) indicated 55 percent of persons with disabilities lacked functional literacy skills, and only 33 percent studied to primary grade seven. The report found some children with mental disabilities were sometimes denied food and were tied to trees and beds with ropes in order to control their movements. The report further stated the needs of children with autism and learning difficulties were ignored due to an insufficient number of special needs schools. Government agencies responsible for protecting the rights of persons with disabilities included the Ministry of State for Disabled Persons, the NCD, and the Ministry of Gender, Labor, and Social Development, but these entities lacked sufficient funding to undertake any significant initiatives. In the government‚Äôs effort to ensure that there is adequate representation of people with disability in roles of position, there are 5 seats in parliament which have been reserved for persons with disability. Read Final Report On Elections for Member of Parliament Representing People with Disabilities 2016 These initiatives by the government will ensure that the minority group which have been oppressed systematically for decades will now have a form of empowerment.

Many of his works, which are strongly influenced by the country's 1973‚Äì90 military regime, satirize the national condition through metaphors. He is the author of more than 70 titles translated into several languages, including plays, novels, storybooks, and essays. Biography Marco Antonio de la Parra studied at the National Institute and later enrolled at the University of Chile, where he graduated as a surgeon in 1976 and specialized in adult psychiatry. His career as a dramatist began at the university, where he directed the Theater of the Faculty of Medicine from 1974 to 1976, and became known as a playwright. In 1975 he received an honorable mention in the university's dramaturgy competition for Matatangos, disparen sobre el zorzal, which would be released three years later. In 1978, his play Lo crudo, lo cocido, lo podrido was censored prior to its premiere at the Catholic University. Hern√°n Larra√≠n, the head of a commission representing the military regime, insisted that this was not a political persecution, writing, \\"We suppress it for the language and its content, which we consider disrespectful.\\" Mar√≠a de la Luz Hurtado, a researcher for the university's theater school, disagreed with this, writing, \\"The work was not censored because there was rudeness, but for a political issue, obviously. There is no doubt that what is symbolized there is the authoritarian order.\\" Between 1984 and 1987, de la Parra directed the company La Teatroneta. He then founded the Theater of the Inextinguishable Passion. He was later artistic director of the Transatlantic Project, for scenic investigation and expanding the exchange of theatrical teaching between Chile and Spain. As an actor, he has interpreted many of his own works. With Chile's return to democracy, after Augusto Pinochet was forced to surrender power due to his defeat in the 1988 plebiscite, de la Parra was appointed cultural attach√© to the embassy in Spain by the government of Patricio Aylwin. He served in this position from January 1991 to September 1993. On his return from Spain, he was a television critic for the evening edition of La Segunda, under the pseudonym Zap Zap, until 1998. De la Parra has ventured into several literary genres: story, novel, drama, essay, script, and chronicle. In addition, he has taught at the Catholic University, where he was Professor of Dramaturgy from 1993 to 1995. Beginning in 2005, he directed Finis Terrae University's School of Literature of the Faculty of Communications and Humanities and, from 2012 to 2015, its Theater School. At this house of studies he also directs the 21st Century Chair, which puts forward reflections on the great trends that are prevailing in the fields of culture, science, and social disciplines. He was the host of Puro cuento on . In addition, he conducts dramaturgy workshops both in Chile and abroad. As of 2014, he has a column in La Segunda. In 1997 he was elected an active member of the Chilean Academy of Fine Arts, where he occupies chair No. 22. His works have been translated into several languages. He is married to the journalist Ana Josefa Silva.

Right: The princess stares longingly out a window, awaiting the return of her prince, The Prince's Progress and Other Poems is Christina Rossetti's second volume of poetry, published by Macmillan in 1866. Christina's brother Dante Gabriel Rossetti designed the illustrations and bindings for the publication, just as he had for her first volume, Goblin Market and Other Poems. The Prince's Progress tells the story of a princess awaiting the return of her prince. After tarrying due to a series of temptations and self-indulgences, the prince returns only to find that the princess has died. Dante Gabriel Rossetti's frontispiece illustration depicts the grief-stricken prince upon hearing the news of his princesse's death; the title illustration depicts the princess staring longingly out the window as she waits for her prince to return. The 1866 edition contains 46 poems in addition to \\"The Prince's Progress.\\" Dante Gabriel Rossetti disagreed with the gaudy ornamentation of many Victorian books, and thus attempted to refine the heavily ornamented book with his own bindings. In this publication, he employs a combination of minimalist motifs and contemporary technology, seen specifically in the gold stamping. The hand and machine work of this design ensured the perpetuation of Rossetti‚Äôs aesthetic through wider accessibility. Gold stamped 'nailheads' on green cloth. The gold design makes reference to clasps and nailheads on medieval books, and it is repeated on both the cover and back of the book. In conjunction with the wood-engraved illustrations, this binding has an integrated role in the art of the book as a whole. In addition to the medieval allusion, the organic motifs reflect the theme of growth and change within the text. In this way, the binding becomes a part of the narrative. Poems include: The Prince's Progress Maiden-Song Jessie Cameron Spring Quiet The Poor Ghost A Portrait Dream-Love Twice Songs in a Cornfield A Year's Windfalls The Queen of Hearts One Day A Bird's-Eye View Light Love A Dream A Ring Posy Beauty Is Vain Lady Maggie What Would I Give?

He is a founding member and managing director of German Parcel (now GLS Group). He was the CEO of Royal Mail from 2018 to 2020. Early life Rico Back was born in 1954 in Hamburg, Germany. Career In 1989, Back was a founding member and managing director of German Parcel, a European-wide parcel logistics firm. In 1999 Back led the sale of German Parcel to Royal Mail, subsequently rebranded as GLS. The company is now one of the largest ground-based deferred parcel networks in Europe. Its revenues grew from ¬£1 billion in 2002 to ¬£3 billion in 2019. It contributed 64% of Royal Mail Group‚Äôs adjusted operating profit from 30% of group revenues. In 2019 the division was estimated to be worth ¬£2 billion based on an operating profit of ¬£180 million. Back served as the CEO of GLS for 18 years before taking over as Royal Mail Group CEO in 2018. As CEO of Royal Mail Parcels (2016 to 2018), Back was responsible for all international activities as well as the national parcel business.[2] [3] He succeeded Moya Greene as Royal Mail CEO when she retired in June 2018. He received the same ¬£790,000 pay and benefits package as Greene, plus a possible ¬£1.3 million bonus and a ¬£6 million golden hello; his personal taxes were paid in and to the UK. During his tenure, UK parcel volume growth reached a four-year peak in 2018 and Royal Mail‚Äôs share of the UK parcel market grew to 53% by volume by March 2018, driven by winning business from online retailers. In its 2019 full-year results, a year into Back‚Äôs tenure as CEO, Royal Mail announced a five-year turnaround plan focused on expanding the company‚Äôs parcels business internationally, addressing the growth in online deliveries. As part of the plan, Royal Mail pledged to invest a further ¬£1.8 billion in its UK postal service. On 15 May 2020, Back resigned as CEO of Royal Mail, with chairman Keith Williams succeeding him as interim CEO. His departure came as Royal Mail experienced a rise in parcel volumes and a downturn in letter volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's revenues annual revenues in April 2020 had fallen by ¬£22 million against the previous year.

The driver targeted pedestrians, killing 10 and injuring 16, some critically. The attack started at the intersection of Yonge Street and Finch Avenue and proceeded south along the sidewalks of Yonge Street to near Sheppard Avenue. The driver was taken into custody just south of the crime scene, after leaving the van and reportedly attempting to commit suicide by cop. The arrest was made at 1:32 p.m. EDT, seven minutes after the first 9-1-1 call reporting the incident was made. The attack is characterized as revenge for perceived sexual and social rejection. The incident is the deadliest vehicle-ramming attack in Canadian history. Incident The first 9-1-1 call reporting pedestrians being hit was received at 1:25 p.m. Eastern Time. At Finch Avenue, a white Chevrolet Express van, rented from Ryder, ran a red light, then drove southbound on the west- side sidewalk of Yonge Street, striking multiple pedestrians. The van continued along the sidewalk for several more blocks, hitting additional pedestrians. Security camera video from a local business shows the van reaching Tolman Street, which is one block south of Finch Avenue, at 1:24 p.m. A witness said the driver looked the victims directly in the eye during the attack and acted as if he was \\"playing a video game, trying to kill as many people as possible\\". At one point, the van re-entered the roadway due to the narrowness of the sidewalk, but at Park Home Avenue, the van again drove onto the sidewalk, hitting pedestrians in front of Mel Lastman Square, a civic plaza on the west side of Yonge Street, south of Finch Avenue (16 blocks). Paramedics were dispatched immediately to the site and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre was activated as an emergency centre. Nine people died at the scene and sixteen were injured. At 8:15 p.m., the Toronto Police Service (TPS) announced that a tenth person had died. Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre reported that two persons arrived without vital signs and were pronounced dead on arrival, five were in critical condition, two serious and one in fair condition. alt= aerial view of Mel Lastman Square looking west from across the street A single police officer in traffic control capacity, TPS constable Ken Lam, intercepted the damaged van, which was stopped on the north sidewalk on Poyntz Avenue, just west of Yonge Street and two blocks south of Sheppard Avenue, about south of where the attack began. Lam stopped his cruiser near the van and confronted the suspected driver, later identified as Alek Minassian, standing near the opened driver-side door. During the confrontation, Minassian repeatedly drew his hand from his back pocket and pointed a dark-colored object toward the police officer as if it were a pistol. Lam ordered Minassian to drop to the ground, while Minassian tried repeatedly to provoke the officer to kill him, demanding he be shot \\"in the head!\\" when the officer warned him he may be shot. Lam then went to his cruiser and turned off its siren. As Minassian and Lam advanced towards each other, the officer recognized that the object in Minassian's hand was not a gun, holstered his pistol, and took out his baton to avoid the use of unnecessary lethal force. Minassian then dropped the object from his hand, lay down on the ground and surrendered to Lam. He was arrested at 1:32 p.m. Victims #Torontostrong memorial in Olive Square, North York, April 27, 2018 *Beutis Renuka Amarasinghe, 45, nutritionist *Andrea Knafelc Bradden, 33, Slovenian-Canadian account executive *Geraldine Brady, 83, Avon saleswoman *So He Chung, 22, University of Toronto student *Anne Marie D'Amico, 30, financial analyst *Mary Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Forsyth, 94, retiree *Chul Min \\"Eddie\\" Kang, 45, chef *Ji Hun Kim, 22, Seneca College student from South Korea *Munir Najjar, 85, Jordanian retiree visiting family *Dorothy Sewell, 80, retiree Several others were injured, including Robert Anderson, Amir Kiumarsi, Aleksandra Kozhevinikova, Mavis Justino, Morgan McDougall, Jun Seok Park, Samantha Peart, So Ra, Catherine Riddell, Sammantha Samson, Beverly Smith, Amaresh Tesfamariam and Yunsheng Tian. Suspect Police identified the suspect as Alek Minassian, who had no prior criminal history. According to his LinkedIn profile, he was a student at Seneca College in North York from 2011 to 2018 and lived in Richmond Hill. Minassian had attended Sixteenth Avenue Public School, an elementary school in Richmond Hill, in a special education class. He was a software and mobile app developer. His former classmates at Thornlea Secondary School in Thornhill described him as \\"not overly social\\" and \\"harmless\\". Minassian attended a special needs class for students within the autism spectrum while at Thornlea Secondary School; Minassian's mother is quoted as saying in a 2009 article that her son has Asperger syndrome. In late 2017, Minassian enrolled in the Canadian Armed Forces for two months, before requesting voluntary release after 16 days of recruit training. A senior military official said that Minassian \\"wasn't adapting to military life, including in matters of dress, deportment and group interactions in a military setting\\" and \\"there were no red flags and nothing that would point to anything like this.\\" Following the attack, a Facebook post made by Minassian was uncovered in which he identified himself as an incel (\\"involuntary celibate\\"). The state of involuntary celibacy refers to being unable to find sexual partnersKoulouris, Theodore. \\"Online misogyny and the alternative right: debating the undebatable.\\" Feminist Media Studies (2018): 1‚Äì12. and its subculture consists of primarily male online communities, many of whom also belong to the alt-right movement.https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/canadian- right-wing-extremism-online-1.5617710 The post, dated to shortly before the beginning of the attack on April 23, allegedly read: > Private (Recruit) Minassian Infantry 00010, wishing to speak to Sgt 4chan > please. C23249161. The Incel Rebellion has already begun! We will overthrow > all the Chads and Stacys! All hail the Supreme Gentleman Elliot Rodger! \\"Chad\\" and \\"Stacy\\" are nicknames used on incel-related forums within 4chan and Reddit, to refer to popular, attractive, sexually active men and women, respectively. The term \\"Incel Rebellion\\" is sometimes used interchangeably with the term \\"Beta Uprising\\" or \\"Beta Male Uprising\\", which refers to a violent response to sexlessness, which incels view as sexual deprivation. Elliot Rodger was the mass murderer behind the 2014 Isla Vista killings in California, and someone whom Minassian claimed to have contact with up until days before the 2014 attacks. Rodger intended to target attractive women and sexually successful men, which led to him being posthumously idolized by some people on misogynistic online fringe communities, including several incel websites. Facebook, Inc. verified the account as Minassian's. A source in the Department of National Defence told media that C23249161 was Minassian's military identification number during his army training. Legal proceedings On April 24, 2018, Minassian appeared without a lawyer before the Ontario Court of Justice in a Toronto courthouse, shackled and wearing a white prison jumpsuit. He was charged with 10 counts of first degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder and ordered not to contact any of the alleged attempted murder victims. His father, Vahe Minassian, attended the hearing and cried. He told reporters that he had not spoken to his son. Minassian was charged with three additional counts of attempted murder on May 10: a total of 16 counts. He has since retained Toronto criminal lawyer Boris Bytensky to represent him. His trial was initially scheduled for February 10, 2020, later moved to March 2, and later moved to April 6, but was postponed again because of the COVID-19 pandemic, to November 9. Aftermath The Toronto subway and bus services in the area were immediately closed or rerouted by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). Parts of Yonge Street were cordoned off until late on April 24 for the police investigation. Civic buildings in the area were closed late April 23 and remained closed throughout April 24. Area businesses were allowed to remain open, but in areas of pedestrian deaths, those fronting on Yonge Street were allowed access from only the rear entrances. Many businesses in the most- affected areas chose to close down for all of April 24, while some opened at different times of the afternoon of April 24. The area was fully open and transit services resumed by April 25. Security was heightened around a meeting of G7 security ministers being held in Toronto in advance of the 44th G7 summit in La Malbaie, Quebec. The ministers were briefed on the attack shortly after it occurred and the day after the attack, the meeting's agenda included discussion on \\"soft targets\\", terrorism and social media, and online youth radicalization. The incidence was included in the 2018 Public Report on the Terrorism Threat to Canada. Faisal Hussain, the alleged perpetrator of the 2018 Toronto shooting had also developed an interest in inceldom prior to his attack but police found no evidence of radicalization. =Sporting events= Around the Air Canada Centre, roads were closed and blocked off with dump trucks, due to safety concerns for fans gathered at Maple Leaf Square to watch the National Hockey League playoff game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Boston Bruins on the evening of April 23. A moment of silence was observed during the game in sympathy for the victims. Concrete barriers were put up along the edge of the northern sidewalk along Bremner Boulevard in front of the Rogers Centre, due to the same safety concerns prior to the Toronto Blue Jays game against the Boston Red Sox on April 24, 2018. Prior to the game, the Blue Jays honoured a few of the first responders in a ceremony, which included a video memorial for the victims of the attack followed by a moment of silence. Reactions Memorial scene in Mel Lastman Square, April 27, 2018 #Torontostrong vigil in Mel Lastman Square, April 29, 2018 Many domestic leaders expressed their support and condolences in the immediate aftermath of the attack, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer, and Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne. Toronto Mayor John Tory added that the city would support the police investigation. Constable Ken Lam was lauded as a hero for his measured use of force to achieve a non-fatal resolution of his confrontation with Minassian, despite Minassian's seeking suicide by cop. Lam insisted that he was simply performing his duty. Lighting at the CN Tower and the 3D Toronto sign at Nathan Phillips Square were colourless and dimmed for the evening of April 23. Flags were placed at half- mast at most government locations in Toronto and surrounding municipalities. An impromptu memorial at Olive Square Park on the east side of Yonge Street, directly across the street from where the attack began, was started by a local resident at 5:15 p.m. of the same day for people to place flowers and express their grief in writing. The person who started the memorial indicated that all the other public spaces along Yonge Street, including Mel Lastman Square, were cordoned off by police tape so he chose Olive Square which was not cordoned off. Small memorials ranging from a few bunches of flowers to about two dozen bunches of flowers, plus paper messages, photographs and candles in some cases, were established at each location from just south of Finch Avenue to just south of Park Home Avenue where a pedestrian was killed (at the southwest corner of Yonge Street and Park Home Avenue two victims were killed). Next to the fountain at the entry to Mel Lastman Square, where the greatest number of people were struck (at least two killed), another memorial gradually grew to become a hub memorial almost as large as the one at Olive Square. =#TorontoStrong= Several crowdfunding campaigns were set up to raise money for the expenses of the victims' families. Prominent Canadian Muslim charities included Islamic Relief Canada and Canada Zakat, that raised funds after the Quebec City mosque shooting, collected large numbers of donations. To better coordinate crowdfunding, the City of Toronto established the #TorontoStrong Fund to support victims and their families, first responders, and those affected by trauma. The hashtag was reused in memoriam of the victims of a fatal mass shooting that occurred in the Danforth on July 22 of the same year. Several vigils were held in the following week. A small vigil was held at Lastman Square on the evening of April 24. Another was held by the Toronto Korean Community Association on April 27 at Lastman Square. An official #TorontoStrong Vigil was held by the City of Toronto on April 29, attended by several thousand. It began with a march from Yonge and Finch and ended with a gathering at Lastman Square. Speaking at the gathering were community leaders and the event was attended by Prime Minister Trudeau, Governor General Julie Payette, Premier Wynne, Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard, and Mayor Tory. The two main impromptu memorials at Olive Square Park and Mel Lastman Square were decommissioned on June 3, 2018, and later replaced with a temporary plaque. Mayor John Tory announced plans to erect a permanent memorial for the attack. On June 13, 2018, the #TorontoStrong's volunteer steering committee announced the appointment of former Toronto mayor Barbara Hall as fund administrator. She was tasked with distributing the money raised for the victims and survivors. By December 2018, over $4 million from the fund had been distributed to victims and families of both the van attack and the Danforth shooting.

Kleeb Lamduan cookies are uniquely made by placing them in a container with a Tian Op scented candle used for dessert making. When the container is closed the candle is extinguished and the aromatic smoke is trapped inside. Modern recipes are also often adapted from the original by using icing sugar instead of caster sugar, vegetable oil instead of lard and some bakers add a portion of salt.  History of kleeb lamduan  Kleeb lamduan is one of the auspicious authentic Thai desserts served only inside the palace. Nowadays, it is easy to find because descendants of couriers have baked and sold the dessert for the public. As time passes, kleeb lamduan has been changed from the original recipe in terms of the baking process, the number of petals, color, or even the ingredients. The original recipe used only flour, sugar, and lard (now vegetable oil can be used instead) before mixing all ingredients and turning it into a dough. Flour was then laid under the sun to make flour fluffy. It is a process of how ancient people made desserts and avoided using baking powder or baking soda. When being made, kleeb lamduan must have six petals in total, three petals on the outside and three petals on the inside. When this process is complete, the next process is to bake it at the proper temperature and flip them regularly to create perfect cooking. Kleeb lamduan should be evenly cooked and contains crunchy texture. The final process, before served, kleeb lamduan must be smoked with a scented candle.

He is also a novelist and publicist in Israel known for his extremely divisive views. Biography Hetsroni was born in Tel Aviv in 1968, the only child of Sima (nee Kolker; 1932‚Äì2011) and David Hetsroni (originally Shtagovsky; 1933-2016). Upon finishing high school studies he was conscripted into the Israel Defense Forces for three years. He was initially deployed in Nablus and as a security guard at a military base in Tel Aviv before serving as a military correspondent for two years. He graduated with BA in Psychology and Cinema and Television from Tel Aviv University in 1993 and received an MA in 1996 and PhD in Communication from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1999. He worked as a senior lecturer at Max Stern Yezreel Valley College from 2000 to 2009 and then became a professor at Ariel University which fired him in 2014 following an article he wrote that supported the BDS movement and objected to the 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict. In May 2015, he left Israel for Denmark.https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001037007 After living in Copenhagen for a while, he moved to China and taught at Xi'an Jiaotong- Liverpool University in Suzhou for a year, then moved to Turkey and became a full-time associate professor at Ko√ß University in Istanbul. Hetsroni published hundreds of op-ed articles expressing post-Zionist views, one novel ◊§◊ô◊¶◊ï◊ó◊ô◊ù (\\"Family Feud\\" ‚Äì Hebrew) about wallflower upbringing in the 1980s, and one graphic novel ◊ê◊ë◊ï◊ì ◊ë◊°◊ô◊ü (\\"Lost in China\\" ‚Äì Hebrew) written in collaboration with Racheli Rottner and based on his turbulent partly open relationship with Shirin Noufi ‚Äì an Israeli-Arab lawyer. Hetsroni is intentionally child free. In May 2020, as part of Switzerland International Film Festival (SIFF) official competition, a feature-length documentary \\"Amir Hetsroni: Case Study\\" made by the Swiss-Israeli psychologist and film director Giuseppe (Yossi) Strenger was screened. The film was shot in late 2016, on the month following David Hetsroni's ‚Äì Amir's father ‚Äì death, and unfolds Amir's mourning process and his relationship with Shirin Noufi, his partner at the time. The film won the first place in the festival's \\"Best Documentary\\" category. Academic Work Hetsroni wrote and edited four books and nearly 100 journal articles and book chapters. His main areas of research are sex, violence, and other objectionable contents on television programs and commercials and their effect on our perception of daily life. He showed that in contrast with common wisdom, inpatients in medical drama are more likely to die than in real hospitals and that religious viewers tend to be less afraid of crime and terror as they watch more television than are non-religious viewers. In the main, Hetsroni aligns with the cultivation school which suggests that routine viewing of television unconsciously influences the viewers to see the world through TV eyes, but he often adopts a more limited effect paradigm than the theory proponents George Gerbner and Larry Gross. Hetsroni's most original contribution to the scientific literature is the conception of pluralistic media ignorance according to which the more saturated the home screen is with objectionable content, the more likely viewers are to over-estimate the content's actual prevalence because of the difficulty in counting. He was associate editor of Communication Research Reports and Corporate Communications and is listed among the 100 most prolific authors in advertising scholarship im a study published in 2008 in Journal of Advertising. Political Opinions and Ideological Debates Hetsroni describes himself as an \\"anti-Zionist who is not pro-Arabic\\". He has made comments in favor of colonialism and against absorption of refugees from the Third World. Since the early 2010s, Hetsroni's name has been associated with various scandals where he expressed a divisive outlook. In 2011, when a socialist protester set himself alight at a demonstration, Hetsroni commented that this was \\"an inexpensive way to get rid of a social parasite\\". In 2013, he described feminist women marching in the SlutWalk as \\"too bulky to be looked at\\" and said that if he needed to choose between rescuing a feminist and rescuing a cat, he would rescue the cat as cats are more grateful than are feminists. He sued for slander a feminist activist who called him \\"misogynist consumer of prostitution\\" and won. In 2014, he described the Israeli war in Gaza as a massacre, and in 2015 he blamed Mizrahi Jews in the victory of the right wing in the parliamentary elections, and added that these Jews should have stayed in their homeland. This brought about public outcry and demands to interrogate Hetsroni for spreading racism and hate speech. Further demands came in 2016, when Hetsroni desecrated the national flag by posting a picture in which he uses the flag to mop the floor at his house and in 2017 when he posted a picture of himself smiling on the graves of soldiers saying that they were \\"idiots who did not know how to avoid the draft\\".

The spiritual institution Paramhans Satyarthi Mission was led and governed by him. In 1985, Shri Paramhans Swami Ramanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj anointed him as his spiritual successor and the patron saint of the Paramhans Satyarthi Mission. Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj travelled around the world and preached about spirituality and enlightenment. Swami Ramanand Satyarthi Trust, Shri Satyarthi High School, Shri Satyarthi Sevadal and Shri Satyarthi Sandesh Magazine were also administered under his guidance.  Life  He was born on 5 September 1943, in a religious family and was named as Shri Khairati Lal Bhardwaj. His father, Pandit Khushiram Bhardwaj was a devotee of Lord Krishna and a scholar of Sanskrit, Astrology, Vedanta, Shastras and Upanishads. Pandit Khushiram Bhardwaj Ji became a disciple of Swami Swarupanand Ji Maharaj, adopted a life of renunciation (Sanyas) and was later famed as Shri Rajyogacharya Paramhans Swami Ramanand Satyarthi ji Maharaj. Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj acquired knowledge of Rajyoga from Shri Swami Ramanand Satyarthi ji Maharaj. By the age of ten years, he used to go into state of super-consciousness (Samadhi) with ease. He continued his practices of Raj Yoga with his schooling and graduation. He completed his degree of M.A. and married a well-read girl hailing from a cultured family. Shri Swami Advaitanand Ji Maharaj (1846-1919) the \\"First Spiritual Master\\" of the Advait Mat, initiated Shri 1008 Paramhans Swami Swarupanand Ji Maharaj (also known as Shri Nangli Nivasi Bhagwan Ji) in the early 1900s. Swami Swarupanand Ji Maharaj is considered a super-eminent spiritual master in India. Thousands of people visit Shri Nangli Sahib where resides the Samadhi temple of Shri Swami Swarupanand Ji Maharaj. He had initiated more than a thousand Mahatmas and Baijis as disciples. In 1930, Shri Swami Swarupanand Maharaj Ji permitted Shri Swami Ramanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj to give Updesh to devotees acknowledging his spiritual state. Accordingly, Shri Swami Ramanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj started preaching in Saalam Ashram in West Punjab (now in Pakistan). Shri Paramhans Swami Ramanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj laid the foundation of Raj Yog Mandir in Delhi on the day of Kartik Poornima in 1964. He also founded the spiritual institution Paramhans Satyarthi Mission. On 2 July 1985 (the day of Vyas Pooja), Shri Swami Ramanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj declared Shri Khairati Lal Bhardwaj as his spiritual successor and the patron saint of Paramhans Satyarthi Mission and named him as Shri Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj. Shri Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj and his wife (Sant Maa Divyanand Satyarthi Ji) took sanyaas and vowed to publicize the supreme knowledge of Paramhans tradition on 8 January 1995 at Shri Satyarthi Samadhi Mandir, Shri Nangli Sahib, Meerut. Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj founded various Satyarthi Dhams (Ashrams) at New Delhi, Haridwar, Lucknow, Chhatarpur, etc. Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj organised Gyan-Yagyas at different places and camps for spiritual and moral understanding every year at Rajyog Mandir, New Delhi.  Primary teachings  The primary teachings of Shri Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj are Bhakti, Sewa (Service), Prem (love) and RƒÅja yoga (meditation). The spiritual institution (Paramhans Satyarthi Mission) led by Shri Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj believes in the principle of Vasudev Kutumbkam. The symbol of the mission is Hans or the swan bird on the lotus flower. \\"Satya\\" (truth) is the methodology of the mission. Shri Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj preached the concept and relevance of Advaita Vedanta, self-realization (Aatm Gyan) and the practices of Dhyana and meditation. Advait refers to the idea that the soul (Atman) is the same as the highest metaphysical reality (Brahman). Advaita Vedanta emphasizes the idea that moksha is achievable in this life in contrast to Indian philosophies that emphasize moksha after death. Advaita Vedanta is one of the most studied and most influential schools of classical Indian thought. Advaita philosophy is non-dualistic. = Raj Yoga = Raj yoga is variously referred to as \\"Royal Yoga\\", \\"Sahaj Marg\\", \\"Surat Shabd Yog\\", 'Sahaj Yog'. Raj yoga refers to the goal of yoga (which is samadhi). Raja Yoga meditation is an inwardly oriented practice. Shri Swami Keshwanand Satyarthi Ji Maharaj initiated disciples on the meditation of the Holy Name (mantra). This mantra is given to the devotees as Updesh (teaching). It is known to make the person‚Äôs life free of all hassles, to show and guide him in the right direction. Advanced practices of Raja Yoga are known as Sehaj Samadhi Vigyan. He has written several books on Rajyog, Sewa, Satya, etc. = Sewa = In his view, Sewa is the best way of practicing Bhakti. It could be in any way, by going to temples and physically contributing to the activities happening there, by remembering the Lord in our hearts and doing Pooja (worship) at home, or by donating to the funds meant for spiritual uplifment of the masses. = Bhakti = Bhakti means devotion. Bhakti yoga means to surrender to the supremacy of the Lord / Master in a child-like innocence. The goal of the one who practices Bhakti yoga is to dwell in a state of constant remembrance of his beloved Lord and see the world as a manifestation of God.

The summit of the volcano reaches a height of , and its caldera is the largest caldera of the Tibesti. Neighbouring volcanoes include Doudriki east, Ehi Dosoatou south and Ehi Fodoboro southwest of the caldera. The Enneri Yega river drains the caldera westward and then south, before joining the Enneri Debarsar; in the past (Holocene) the rivers reached Lake Chad. The history of the volcano is characterized by the emission of tephras, with the downsagging of the caldera floor generating a depression. Basaltic vents and Lava domes were emplaced within this caldera, and an intrusion named Ehi Yod√©√Ø developed farther south. The caldera is heavily eroded, with almost the entire southern side eroded away, and the younger Voon ignimbrite has been emplaced inside of it; it belongs to a different volcano, Tarso Voon. Humans have used the caldera for irrigated agriculture.

The papal conclave of March 1605 was convened on the death of Pope Clement VIII and ended with the election of Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici as Pope Leo XI on 1 April 1605. It was the first of two papal conclaves in 1605, with Leo dying on 27 April 1605, twenty-six days after he was elected, and the conclave to elect his successor being held in May. The conclave saw conflict regarding whether Cesare Baronius should be elected pope, and Philip III of Spain, the Spanish king, excluded both Baronius and the eventually successful candidate, Medici. Philip's exclusion of Medici was announced by Cardinal √Åvila after his election to the papacy, and the other cardinals did not view it as valid since Medici had already been elected pope. Nicholas II had reserved the right to elect the pope to the cardinal bishops, priests, and deacons of Rome in 1059. The cardinal bishops were the highest rank, being the bishops of the ancient suburbicarian dioceses, the priests ranked next, who served as the titular head of historically important churches in Rome, and last ranked the cardinal deacons, who were nominally assigned one of the ancient diaconia where traditionally deacons had administered the temporal property of the Church of Rome. Cardinals were required to have been ordained at least to the rank of their order within the College of Cardinals, but could also be ordained to a higher order as well. In 1586, Pope Sixtus V mandated that the maximum number of cardinals would be seventy. Of these, the College of Cardinals had sixty- nine total members at the time of Clement VIII's death, but only sixty were present for the first conclave of 1605 when it opened, and sixty-one total electors were present for the election of Leo XI. The electors present had been created by six different popes: Pius IV, Gregory XIII, Sixtus V, Gregory XIV, Innocent IX, and Clement VIII. Of these, Clement's creations were the most numerous, having created thirty-eight of the cardinal electors. Innocent IX had created one of the conclave's electors, Gregory XIV had created five, Sixtus V had created eleven, Gregory XIII had created four, and Pius IV had created one. Pietro Aldobrandini, the cardinal-nephew of Clement VIII, was the elector who controlled the largest number of votes with twenty-two of Clement's thirty-eight creations following his instructions. Alessandro Peretti di Montalto, the nephew of Sixtus V, controlled eight votes. Thirteen of the cardinal electors were loyal to the Spanish monarchy, and these electors and the faction loyal to Montalto were aligned. In addition to these groups, eight of the electors formed a faction that were loyal to the French crown.

It was written by Andre Jacquemetton and Maria Jacquemetton and directed by Tim Hunter. The episode originally aired on AMC in the United States on August 17, 2008. The episode tackles on the professional and personal lives of three of its main characters- Don, Roger and Peggy-over the three most religious Sundays of the year. The workers at Sterling Cooper anxiously prepare for a pitch for American Airlines. Peggy develops a relationship with the priest at her church. Don meticulously tries to perfect the right presentation for their potential client. Roger struggles to find a romantic companionship with a call girl.  Plot  = Passion Sunday = The episode begins with Peggy and her family at the Church of the Holy Innocents. In an attempt to leave, Peggy lies to her sister and says that she feels sick. On her way out she meets Father Gill, a visiting priest. After a short conversation, Peggy decides to go back into the church for the rest of service. In the next scene, Don and Betty are sleeping in bed at home, but are woken up by a phone call from Francine about her barbecue. In the living room, Sally makes Don a drink of vodka and tomato juice. In the midst of this, Bobby is reprimanded for touching the stereo, but he lies about doing so. At the Olson residence, Father Gill comes over to their house for dinner. The Olson women ask the father to do a prayer before eating. During dinner, Peggy announces that she needs to be headed to work. Her mother tells Father Gill about Peggy's career as a copywriter at Sterling Cooper, leading Father Gill to offer her a ride to work. At a restaurant, Roger and Mona have dinner with Margaret and her fianc√©, Brooks. Margaret doesn't want a big wedding, which contrasts to Mona's want for her daughter to have a huge wedding with family and friends. Roger defers to Brooks for his opinion, to which he agrees with Margaret. = Palm Sunday = Father Gill gives Peggy's sister, Anita, and their mom a copy of the sermon from that day. Anita's jealousy starts to grow when she realizes she caught the attention of their priest. Back at the Draper residence, Don is making pancakes, when he receives a phone call from Duck. The American Airlines pitch has been moved up to Friday, instead of in two weeks, so Don must come into the office. While Don is distracted by the phone call, Bobby burns himself on the pancake griddle. Betty has to take Bobby to the hospital, so Don brings Sally to work. At Sterling Cooper, Duck prepares the account men and the creatives for the American Airlines presentation. Not satisfied, Don sets the creatives aside to review and revise the idea behind the pitch. During their lunch break, Don demands the creatives start with the new idea of American Airlines pushing towards their new frontier. He doesn't want them to mention anything of the airline's past. As the workers focus on the pitch, Sally indulges in adult-like activities which include: asking Joan about her ‚Äúbig ones‚Äù, asking Paul about his intimate relationship with his girlfriend, and drinking an alcoholic beverage. Not in attendance, Roger sleeps with a call girl named Vicki. Afterwards, Roger asks her to dine with him at Lut√®ce. On Good Friday, the Sterling Cooper crew perfectly prepares the boardroom for American Airlines. Unfortunately, Duck reveals moments before the meeting that their client contact, Shel Kenneally has been fired, essentially destroying their chances of landing the account. The Sterling Cooper team must present to the remaining American Airlines team, knowing there is no chance they will get the work. Later on that day, Anita makes a confession to Father Gill about her anger towards Peggy's sin of having an illegitimate child. Although stunned by this information, he tells Anita to try to forgive Peggy, since she is not as strong as Anita. In the evening, Don and Betty get into a heated argument about raising their children, particularly disciplining Bobby. After the argument, Bobby and Don have a conversation about Don's late father. Don later reveals to Betty his abuse as a child and how they should be grateful for a child like Bobby. = Easter Sunday = At the Holy Innocents‚Äô egg hunt, Father Gill thanks Peggy for advising him in giving his sermon. Before he left the lawn, he gave an egg to Peggy and told her to give it to the ‚Äúlittle one‚Äù; referring to her child. Peggy looks back puzzled wondering if he knows her secret.  Themes  = Resentment = Resentment is a recurring theme that develops throughout the episode. The Olson family is a prime example of this, specifically in Anita, Peggy's sister. Anita believes that her mother, Katherine, lets Peggy get away with too much. When she goes to the confessionals, she spills a variety of sins, also revealing (unbeknownst to Father Gill) that Peggy had a child out of wedlock, and had seduced a married man (Pete) in the process of doing so. = Nostalgia = The entire series develops along the idea of nostalgia. This episode is no different. Don and Betty's marriage hits another rocky road when it comes to the way that Bobby should be disciplined. Bobby's inability to listen to Betty when she constantly tells him to stop touching things and his actions of doing the opposite and lying about it leads Betty to have an argument with Don about spanking Bobby. She even tells him ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt be the man you are today if your father didn‚Äôt hit you‚Äù. This entire argument results in a heart to heart conversation between Bobby and Don, specifically about Don's past. Bobby asks Don if his father ever got mad, to which Don replies with yes. After a series of other questions, Bobby tells Don that he needs to ‚ÄúGet a new daddy‚Äù. Later that night, Don reveals to Betty that his father beat him a lot, and that she should be happy to have a son like Bobby because he was worse as a child. = The Egg = On the third Sunday, Easter, the Church of the Holy Innocents have an Easter Egg Hunt. At the egg hunt, Father Gill approaches Peggy with a blue egg, and ends their conversation they had by giving her the egg and saying ‚ÄúFor the little one‚Äù. He is referring to the young child that he assumes is Peggy's after Anita's confession. Eggs are commonly known as a sign of fertility and rebirth; it's a sign that Father Gill knows about Peggy's secret about her child.  Reception The episode has generally received positive reviews. Noel Murray from The A.V. Club gave the episode an A stating that it gives ‚Äúlittle slices of life , in which small gestures-Roger pining for his old ways, Peggy taking pride in the way her career aspirations impress an unattainable‚Ä¶‚Äù IGN gave the episode a rating of 8.7/10 explaining how the show ‚Äúcan bring the funny, but it excels in the sorrow.‚Äù Will Dean of The Guardian praised the episode for its attention to Peggy's personal life. He stated that the ‚Äúwhole plot was deftly done‚Äù and that Father Gill's presence ‚Äúwas a subtle and nuanced trick‚Ä¶.\\" Predictable scenario made infinitely more interesting by keeping protagonists away from each other.‚Äù Sally Tamarkin from The Slate suggested for the episode to be used as an introduction for first-time watchers. She implied that if one needed to know a little backstory to Mad Men that ‚Äú‚ÄòThree Sundays‚Äô was the one to watch first.‚Äù  References   External links  * Three Sundays at AMC * Three Sundays on IMDB * Three Sundays on TV.com Category:Mad Men (season 2) episodes Category:2008 American television episodes ","title":"Three Sundays"},{"id":"57212973","text":"was a Japanese politician who served as Governor of Saga Prefecture from 1991 to 2003.

Partisan elections involve judges political party to be listed on the ballot. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has not always elected judges through this process. History The first state constitution was created in 1776, shortly after the country declared its independence from Great Britain. After heated debate over the issue, it was decided that the Pennsylvania governor would appoint state judges and justices. They served seven years, and could be replaced at any time for ‚Äúmisbehavior‚Äù or ‚Äúmaladministration.‚Äù After the seven years, they could be positioned at the same previously-held post, or replaced, depending on the wishes of the governor. In the age of President Andrew Jackson, there was a movement within the state, and country, that all government positions should be held accountable to the will of the people, i.e. the voters. During a Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention, there were more talks about going to an elected judiciary.https://www.pmconline.org/uploads/1/0/8/8/108820081/history-of- judicial-selection-pennsylvania.pdf However, it did not have enough votes to make any substantial change; the tenure for Supreme Court justices was reduced, though, from life to fifteen years. This would mark the first step in reforming the judiciary within the Commonwealth. In 1850, members of the General Assembly proposed legislation for an elected judiciary. The ‚Äúelection versus appointment‚Äù battle raged on within the state. It would not pass for another twenty years. At the 1872 Constitutional Convention, there was considerable pushback from the advocates of the appointment system. A compromise was reached ‚Äì the term for Supreme Court Justices was increased from fifteen years to twenty-one years, but it was made illegal to serve more than one term. Therefore, every justice appointed would be for two decades, then replaced. Almost a century later, at the Constitutional Convention of 1967, the issue erupted again. This time, however, the advocates of judicial elections were far more abundant. The result was to insert in the 1968 primary election a new judicial article which instituted partisan election of judges.http://www.pavotesmart.com/WhydoesPAhaveretentionelectionsforjurists.pdf The article passed, but critics of judicial elections claimed that the language of the article confused voters. Because of this, there was another statewide vote that spring, in which the results were much closer, but still held that people wanted to elect their judges rather than having the governor appoint them. As of 2015, the Brennan Center for Justice lists 16 states in which the high court judges are appointed by the governor and reselected in unopposed retention elections, 15 states in which the high court judges are selected in contested nonpartisan elections, and 7 states in which the high court judges are selected in contested partisan elections. Pennsylvania Judicial System The judiciary of Pennsylvania can be found in Article V of the State Constitution. It established a pyramid-like structure for courts, closely resembling the federal court system, with three main levels called the Supreme Court, Superior Court, and Commonwealth Court. It states that all courts are to be ‚Äúunited‚Äù for the common good. The highest level is the Supreme Court. This court consists of seven justices with the Chief Justice presiding over the chamber. The middle level of the system is the intermediary appellate courts. Pennsylvania contains two intermediary appellate courts: the Superior Court of Pennsylvania and the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth Court has jurisdiction over appeals from decisions typically involving state agencies or cases in which the Commonwealth is a party. The Superior Court generally hears most other appeals. Both the Superior and Commonwealth courts are subservient to the Supreme Court. The Superior Court hears cases from across Pennsylvania and because there is only one Superior Court, its holdings apply statewide. The number of courts and judges are established by the Pennsylvania Constitution and law originating from the General Assembly in Harrisburg. The Court of Common Pleas is the court of general jurisdiction over many civil and criminal matters in Pennsylvania. Before entering the main court system, usually people have to pass through magisterial district courts which are smaller-scale local courts that typically have jurisdiction over traffic citations, preliminary hearings in many criminal matters, and small claims civil cases. Typically, at least one of these exists for every judicial district, if not several depending on the size and population of the county in which the district is located. Alternatively, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh have both established municipal courts ‚Äî the only municipal courts in Pennsylvania ‚Äî that function in much the same way as their magisterial district court counterparts. Election process Before judges and Justices can be elected, they must meet certain basic requirements, such as residency and citizenship. First, all judges (excluding magisterial district judges) have to be a member of the Pennsylvania Bar Association. Elections occur in odd-numbered years. Every judge can run for reelection until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 75. If there is a vacancy, due to death or retirement, it is filled by gubernatorial appointment until there is another election. For the Supreme Court, Superior Court, Commonwealth Court, and Court of Common Pleas, there is a 10-year term. For magisterial district courts and municipal courts, judges serve a 6-year term. Each aspiring judge runs with their political party listed on the ballot, but after victory the party affiliation is erased from his/her name to prevent political pressures. Advantages and disadvantages  Due, among other factors, to Pennsylvania having an overwhelming number of male governors, there were few to no women in the court system. With the change in 1968, however, more women became involved in the judiciary by way of election. The people of Pennsylvania are more likely to elect women to serve as judges and justices than male governors were to appoint them. By the numbers, conservative governors never chose women to be judges, and more liberal ones appointed women about 30% of the time. In recent times, however, more than 28% of judicial seats in the Commonwealth are held by women. The two main disadvantages often argued to counter the affirmative viewpoint is the palpable corruption within the Pennsylvania judicial system and the problems which arise from integrating politics and law, which the state founders warned against. Three separate judges, all having been elected to the Court of Common Pleas, have been involved in scandals while in office in the past ten years (one term). All have been prosecuted in Federal court, with charges ranging from bribery to the artifice to defraud. Another problem is the mixing of politics and law. Massive amounts of money are being spent on these races, which reinforces the notion that these positions are actually political and not purely legal. During the 2015 Supreme Court elections, more than $15 million was raised and spent trying to advertise the candidates to the population, despite the low voting rate for judicial elections in the state.http://www.judicialselection.us/uploads/documents/AJS_PA_study_31810_rev_4BA9652A47AD2.pdf Because these candidates run as either Republican or Democrat, they also got help from PACs; in 2008-2009, about $2.9 million was spent by PACs on Supreme Court elections. Possible future revisions There have been many factions in Pennsylvania that continue to push for reverting to an appointment system for judges. The increasing political emphasis on these elections, as well as the cases of corruption, are beginning to convince the population that the old system was both better for the state and more efficient. There are also talks of subsequently increasing term lengths, reducing judge's salaries, requiring more formal education, and abolishing the retirement requirement for age 75.

E. W. Mason, originally published by Hodder & Stoughton. Set largely in Morocco, the story follows the adventures of Paul Ravenel as he seeks to atone for the disgrace that still attaches to his family name due to the actions of his father who many years earlier in British India had been court-martialled after leaving a key hill fort unguarded. Plot Paul Ravenel, the son of a French mother and a British father, has been educated largely in France. His mother died when he was young and he had a distant relationship with his father, never understanding why he had renounced his own country, taken his wife's name and nationality, and cut himself off completely from his British friends. Following his father's death, Ravenel comes back to England, aged 18, to seek information from his father's old London lawyer about the mystery. When he explains that he wishes to resume his old surname and nationality, and to take a commission in the British Army, he is warned that this might not be possible because of the disgrace that is still attached to his father's name, Revel. He learns that as a young British officer in India his father had been court- martialled and disgraced after leaving a key hill fort unguarded, contrary to orders. Determined to atone for his father's crime, Ravenel seeks a commission in the French army and is sent to Morocco where he meets and falls in love with Marguerite Lambert, a penniless English woman who ‚Äì although from a good family ‚Äì has been forced to earn her keep as a dancer at a disreputable establishment in Casablanca. When Marguerite loses her job Ravenel rescues her, secretly taking her on to Fez when his battalion is posted there. Hearing one night that there is to be an uprising against the French who now rule the city he tries to warn his superior officers, but they do not believe him. Afraid that Marguerite is in mortal danger, he decides to stay with her rather than rejoin his unit. Facing inevitable disgrace as a deserter, Ravenel disappears. Most of his comrades believe him to have been killed in the subsequent massacre of Europeans in the city, but his friend and fellow officer Gerard de Montignac is not so sure and tries to trace him. Discovering that Ravenel had been helped by some moorish friends, de Montignac abandons his search. Some two years later, de Montignac is ordered to take a battalion into the sacred and closed city of Mulai Idris, to force it at last to open its gates to the world. There he discovers Ravenel, living under an assumed name as a moor, along with Marguerite. Still angry at Ravenel‚Äôs treachery, de Montignac contemplates shooting him, but changes his mind when he understands that Marguerite will inevitably take her own life. The couple realise that the day-to-day constraints upon them have become intolerable. They agree that Ravenel should stake all on one final 'splendid throw', and rejoin the French army - this time as a moor. He fights bravely, is awarded the m√©daille militaire, and is discovered in a military hospital by de Montignac, who seeks his help for a secret mission. Ravenel is to infiltrate an enemy camp and relay its changing position to his French commanders so that aeroplanes - frightening devices never before seen by the soldiers - can be brought in to bomb it. Ravenel is almost killed but his mission is successful, the camp is ultimately destroyed, and he is reunited with Marguerite. The London lawyer, now an old man, receives a telegram informing him that Ravenel is returning home, invalided, with a wife. He asks his clerk to get out the necessary forms for securing English nationality. Literary significance and criticism On the book's publication The Spectator said that the story \\"is concerned with the difficulties of the French in their occupation of their portion of Morocco, and presents a vivid picture of that country\\". The reviewer considered that admirers of Mr. Mason's writing would find it pleasant reading, and noted that the book was already proving itself to be a best seller. Title The novel's title comes from a passage in Francis Bacon's Essays Civil and Moral: Of Great Place, which is quoted as the frontispiece: \\"All rising to great place is by a winding stair\\".

The North Korea‚ÄìRussia and China‚ÄìNorth Korea borders run along the middle of the Tumen River, while the China‚ÄìRussia border approaches the junction point overland from the north. Because the theoretical tripoint is in the middle of the river, where it would be impractical to install a border monument, the agreement provides instead that the three countries install border monuments on the riverbank, and that the position of the tripoint be determined with respect to those monuments. The administrative unit on the Russian side of the border is the Khasansky District of Primorsky Krai; on the Korean side, it is the city of Rason; on the Chinese side is Fangchuan. The main Russian border guard station in the area is Peschanaya. =Border line versus border zone= Interpretation of various treaties may mean that a China‚ÄìNorth Korea border zone exists in the river (or even an international condominium). In this case, the tripoint would not strictly be a point where the three countries' sovereign territory meets.

Costumed parties to view the Krewe of Carrollton parade in Uptown were transformed into a krewe with a Queen reigning over the festivities, a ball captain, and sometimes a King. Emulating the format established by traditional Carnival krewes and their courts, such as the Krewe of Proteus and the Mystick Krewe of Comus, the Krewe of Yuga also declared itself a royal krewe with its Yuga Regina. The queen was always a gay man in drag and these celebrations mark a significant point in the history of the city.http://www.glbtqarchive.com/ssh/new_orleans_mgk_S.pdf Homosexuality was against the law at the time, so the tableau balls of the Krewe of Yuga were always clandestine, hidden away, and known only to those invited to participate in the festivities. Due to a police raid in 1962, the krewe dissolved. However, the template for other gay krewes had been set in place, and the Krewe of Petronius, along with the Krewe of Amon-Ra, the Krewe of Ganymede, and the Krewe of Armeinius, boldly continued to declare themselves, albeit always behind closed doors, as a royal krewe.Smith, Howard Philips, Unveiling the Muse: The Lost History of Gay Carnival in New Orleans, 2017, (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, pp. 2-12).

Aphelidium belongs to the phylum Aphelida, and is part of the Opisthosporidia, a sister clade to Fungi.Karpov, S. A., Mamkaeva, M. A., Aleoshin, V. V., Nassonova, E., Lilje, O., Gleason, F. H.. 2014: Morphology, phylogeny, and ecology of the aphelids (Aphelidea, Opisthokonta) and proposal for the new superphylum Opisthosporidia. Front. Microbiol.. https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00112 The cells of Aphelidium are much smaller than the cells of its green algae host, which is protected by a robust cell wall. Aphelidium have evolved a remarkable life cycle to defeat host's defenses. The infection process for Aphelidium is notable for its method of entry. An Aphelidium cyst attached to a potential host will raise its internal pressure by expanding the posterior vacuole before using the sudden release of this pressure to defeat the host cell wall and jet itself into the host. As parasites of green algae, Aphelidium have important implications for the production of biofuels using algaculture.Ding, Y., Peng, X., Wang, Z., Wen, X., Geng, Y., Li, Y.. Isolation and Characterization of an Endoparasite from the Culture of Oleaginous Microalga Graesiella sp. WBG-1. Algal Research. 29: 371-379  History of research  Aphelidium was first described in 1885 by Wilhelm Zopf, however the current phylogenetic organisation was not solidified until the 2010s. In the first half of the 20th century, Aphelidium was put in the Monadinea group, a group of organisms with life cycles resembling a fungus but have amoebic trophic stages. Beginning from the 1950s Aphelidium were included in class Rhizopoda, and for the rest of the 20th century while studies in Aphelidium life cycles and ecology continued Aphelidium was not included in the updated phylogenetic classifications. Interest in classifying Aphelidium renewed in the 21st century when class Aphelidea was established by Gromov, which includes Aphelidium, Amoeboaphelidium, and Pseudaphelidium. rRNA analysis provided the needed resolution for Aphelidium‚Äôs position in the phylogenetic tree, placing it with Cryptomycota (Rozella and the like), and Microsporidia to form the ARM branch. The ARM branch, also known as the Opisthosporidia, forms a monophyletic sister group to fungi. Typical Aphelidium life cycle. Depicts infection of Scenedesmus sp.  Ecology and life cycle  All known examples of Aphelidium are obligate parasites of freshwater phytoplankton.Gleason, F. H., Carney, L. T., Lilje, O., and Glockling, S. L.. Ecological potentials of species of Rozella (Cryptomycota). Fungal Ecol. 5: 651‚Äì656. doi: 10.1016/j.funeco.2012.05.003 As parasites, the life cycle of Aphelidium is closely tied to its ecological relationship with its hosts. The cycle begins with the motile Aphelidium zoospore contacting its host, a green alga. The singular flagellum of the zoospore is lost as part of the attachment process. A pseudopodium extends from the zoospore and probes the host surface, seeking a weakness or gap in the cell wall.Gromov, B. V., and Mamkaeva, K. A. (1975). Zoospore ultrastructure of Aphelidium chlorococcarum Fott. Mikol. Fitopatol. 9, 190‚Äì193. The attached zoospore first encysts then inserts an infection tube into the host cell, priming the ingress of the Aphelidium. The cyst forms a posterior vacuole, which expands and raises the internal pressure of the cyst. Ultimately the pressure pushing against the chitin wall of the cyst punctures the cell wall of the host green alga at the point of insertion of the infection tube, and the Aphelidium enters its host abruptly, leaving the cyst cell wall behind. Once within the host, Aphelidium becomes an amoeboid that proceeds to consume the host from the inside out by phagocytizing host cytoplasm before digesting it internally in a central digestive vacuole.Schnepf, E., Hegewald, E., Soeder, J.. 1971: Elektronenmikroskopische Beobachtungen an Parasiten aus Scenedesmus- Massenkulturen. Archiv f√ºr Mikrobiologie. 75(3): 209-299 As the parasite expands within the host cell, it develops into a multinucleate plasmodium which grows to eventually replace the entirety of the host cytoplasm. Now all that remains of the green alga is its cell wall and the residual body, a clump consisting of host cell fragments indigestible to the parasite. The Aphelidium plasmodium then proceeds to divide into uninucleate cells which develop into zoospores, using the cell wall of the host alga as a sporangium. Finally, the uniflagellate zoospores erupt the husk of the host cell via the same puncture made by the infection tube of the parent Aphelidium to seek new green alga hosts.  Practical importance  Microalgae are candidates for biofuel production, thanks to their fast generation times and low space requirements. In the high-density environment of algal agriculture, parasites can quickly propagate and devastate the algae population, which makes algal endoparasites such as Aphelidium important targets for study.

She uses her middle name \\"Shelbia\\" as her professional surname, which was inherited from her Djerban great-grandmother's Tunisian-Jewish family (of Sephardic Jewish descent), as it is believed to protect against the evil eye. She began by uploading selfies she took by herself on Instagram shortly before her 16th birthday. As a result of finding her photos on her Instagram account, she later received an offer to take photos from the professional photographer Marina Moskowitz. She attended a religious Ulpana high school for girls.L-5150572,00.html The Israeli model who excited Messi Posted: 08.03.18, ynetnews Her modeling soon led to controversy and opposition in her Ulpana, which threatened to send a letter to the Israeli Education Ministry to expel her. Her family however, had been supportive of her career, so long as it would not interfere with her religious studies. And after consultation with Israel's Religious Education Ministry, she was allowed to continue her studies on condition of following certain guidelines. However, combining a modeling career with a religious lifestyle, has led to difficulties, including in terms of modesty of clothing. During a modeling campaign in Milan, she had to live on crackers for four days, as she could not find kosher food.The headmaster told me: Either you stop modeling or you leave By Shimon Ifergan, 8 June 2017, Mako She says she had lost many modeling contracts, due to her keeping of the Sabbath and choices in clothing.

She plans to serve as a soldier in the Israel Defense Forces, rather than serving in the Sherut Leumi as a civilian. The latter is what most religious Jewish girls in Israel opt to do.

It identifies the buying power of the middle class as the necessary ingredient for job creation and economic growth. With consumption typically responsible for two-thirds of the Gross Domestic Product in the Americas consumer spending is key. Middle-out economics maintains it is only the middle class that can create the aggregate demand necessary for business to support full employment levels. Given the wealthy's high propensity to save, middle-out economics holds that large concentrations of wealth are not sufficient cause for job creation. Middle-out economics maintains companies don't hire when they have an abundance of profits; they hire when they have an abundance of customers. The middle-out economic framework is rooted in the scientific fact that economies are complex, adaptive, and eco-systemic. Economies are characterized by the same ‚Äòcircle of life‚Äô like feedback loops found in natural eco-systems. Middle-out economics claims a fundamental law of capitalism must be ‚Äúif workers have no money then businesses have no customers‚Äù. In this sense, it claims that the true ‚Äújob creators‚Äù in a capitalistic economy are customers and not rich business people. It maintains that a thriving middle class is the cause of growth and not the consequence of it. Therefore, the only way to prosperity is from the middle-out. Middle-out economics favors governmental policies that help to ensure the buying power of the middle class. Middle-out economics is held in opposition to Reaganomics, sometimes referred to as trickle-down economics. The term middle-out economics was coined by Eric Liu, a former speechwriter for Bill Clinton, and Nick Hanauer, a venture capitalist.

Early public opinion on NAFTA was ambivalent, where a plurality of polled Americans was either unsure about NAFTA or did not have an opinion about NAFTA. As public opinion on NAFTA evolved, there were intermittent shifts in polls and surveys between support and opposition for NAFTA. However, support or opposition to NAFTA was frequently out of a plurality, as there was regularly a significant portion of respondents that were unsure about NAFTA and or did not have a substantial opinion on NAFTA. Notably, during the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump became a briefly polarizing force on public opinion about NAFTA, where negative views of NAFTA not only proliferated among Republican voters, but also the general population. Broadly, present public opinion on NAFTA is positive, with recent surveys finding that a majority of Americans viewing NAFTA as good for the U.S. economy. However, to note, public opinion towards NAFTA greatly fluctuated when survey data was organized into different categories (e.g. political party, level of education). Currently, accessible public opinion scholarship on NAFTA is scarce with two studies done in the late 1990s. Each examined two different aspects about public opinion on NAFTA. On one hand, Jeffrey E. Cohen‚Äîa professor of political science at Fordham University‚Äîobserved if NAFTA was a case of how well public opinion was taken into consideration by presidents. On the other hand, Eric M. Uslaner‚Äîa professor of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland‚ÄîCollege Park‚Äîstudied whether or not the case of NAFTA demonstrated that shifts in public opinion are in response to major events.  Early public opinion and polling on NAFTA (1992‚Äì1993)  Although the proposed trilateral free trade agreement was one of the more hotly contested issues during the 1992 presidential election, early polling data from NBC/the Wall Street Journal demonstrated that an overall plurality of Americans either had no opinion or were unsure about the policy. From the first administration of the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll on September 12, 1992, 40% were either unsure or did not have an opinion on NAFTA, 27% supported NAFTA, and 34% opposed NAFTA. Likewise, this plurality of ambivalence towards NAFTA persisted until the final administration of the poll on November 14, 1993. On the final poll, the plurality of poll respondents were in favor of NAFTA (36%). The known cause of this shift was due to a televised debate on NAFTA that pitted the then Vice President Albert Gore against Ross Perot. The debate was held on November 9, 1993. In terms of positions, Ross Perot was a staunch opponent of NAFTA, stating that the policy would harm American workers (as the presumption was that American companies would outsource their labor to Mexico as soon as the agreement was put into effect); Albert Gore was in support of NAFTA, stating how beneficial the agreement would be for both the U.S. economy and its trade due to lower trade barriers (e.g. tariffs). As indicated by the positive uptick in support for NAFTA on the last administration of the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll, Albert Gore was perceived by the public as the winner of the debate, ultimately augmenting public support towards NAFTA.  Evolution of public opinion on NAFTA (1999‚Äì2015)  In scope, the evolution of public opinion on NAFTA from 1999 to 2015 frequently switched between support and opposition to the policy. Results from a study done by the Program on International Policy Attitudes in the fall of 1999 illustrated that a plurality of Americans (44%) thought that NAFTA was good for the U.S. In contrast, by 2004, a Newsweek Poll indicated that a plurality of Americans (35%) thought that NAFTA was bad for the U.S. Oppositely, within a year or so, an international policy attitudes poll done in June 2005 revealed that 46% of respondents saw NAFTA as a policy that was good for the U.S. Again in spring 2008, opinions shifted negatively, as a Pew Research Center/Council on Foreign Relations survey saw that 48% of respondents thought that NAFTA was bad for the U.S. A Rasmussen Report apportions this particular shift in opinion towards rising oil and food prices, along with other economic factors. By April 2015, an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll found that a plurality of respondents (32%) thought that NAFTA did not have much of an impact on the U.S. and its economy.  Public opinion on NAFTA since 2016  = 2016 presidential election = During the 2016 election, Donald Trump‚Äîthe Republican candidate for president‚Äîpromulgated a view that was critical of free trade agreements like NAFTA, citing that such agreements affected the U.S. economy negatively and that these were only beneficial to other countries. In terms of influence on partisan voters, a recent study done by researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health noted how registered Republican voters positively received Trump's view, with 68% of those voters opining that free trade agreements like NAFTA were \\"a bad thing\\" for the United States. As a result, a Bloomberg National Poll that was conducted shortly after the inauguration of Donald Trump into office (from February 19 to February 22 of 2016) showed that proportionally, 29% of respondents thought that NAFTA was good for the U.S. economy, 44% of respondents thought that NAFTA was bad for the U.S. economy, and 27% of respondents were unsure. Later, when the same poll was conducted in 2017, the results demonstrated a positive shift in views on NAFTA, whereas 41% thought that NAFTA was good for the economy, 37% thought that NAFTA was bad for the economy, and 22% were unsure. = US public opinion = According to a recent survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, when prompted on whether or not NAFTA was good or bad for the U.S., 56% of all respondents viewed NAFTA as good for the U.S. Similar results were found in a survey run by the Chicago Council of Global Affairs, where 53% of respondents thought that NAFTA was good for the U.S. (and its economy in particular). Categorically, respondents with greater education had more pro-NAFTA views. Overwhelmingly, 70% of postgraduates viewed NAFTA as good for the U.S. In contrast, 57% of college graduates, 52% with some college, and 54% with a high school education or less held the same view. However, along ideological (i.e. partisan) lines, conservative respondents were more likely to hold unfavorable views of NAFTA whereas liberal respondents were more likely to hold favorable views of NAFTA. Numerically, a survey done by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found that 71% of Democrats had a positive view on NAFTA and that 34% of Republicans had a positive view on NAFTA. In the Pew Research Center's survey, 74% of respondents who identified as \\"liberals\\" thought that NAFTA was good and that 31% of respondents who identified as \\"conservatives\\" had the same view as the liberals. = Public opinion scholarship = As of now, there are two accessible studies about public opinion on NAFTA. One study by Jeffery E. Cohen investigated whether or not NAFTA was a case of presidential responsiveness to public opinion. The other study by Eric M. Uslaner inquired into whether or not the case of NAFTA was representative of how public opinion may shift in response to major events. Fundamentally, at its core, both studies attempt to validate whether or not‚Äîwith different methods of examination‚Äîpublic opinion on NAFTA could be validated as a comparable case study. Both studies used data from early polls done by NBC/the Wall Street Journal from 1992 to 1993 to determine if their original hypothesis correlated with the evidence. However, in the end, both scholars were unable to support their hypotheses as both found different results that were contrary to their original hypotheses. Jeffery E. Cohen suggested that NAFTA is not a case of presidential responsiveness to public opinion as \\"too many people had no opinion, and the rest (of the polling categories) were almost evenly divided.\\" Likewise, Eric M. Uslaner suggested that \\"people made up their minds on NAFTA on the basis of arguments about trade, not about their own self-interest.\\"  References  NAFTA United States ","title":"US public opinion on the North American Free Trade Agreement"},{"id":"57213605","text":"Pycnocoris is a genus of plant bugs in the family Miridae.

In Florida, this sanguinivorous (blood-feeding) fly is seen as an adult from March through September, but is most active from May to mid-July. The female has the ability to sense carbon dioxide, which helps it feeds on mammals, especially during the night when it is most active. The larvae are also predaceous and live in the soil adjacent to water and on floating vegetation but can also live in forest sand. The insect's blood is blue.

Built in 1870 to house soldiers sentenced for military offences, the building derived its name from its large, glass lantern roof. The term glasshouse has since become synonymous with all military prison establishments but it has its origins in Aldershot.'Inside the Glasshouse' - the Picture Post, 30 May 1942 Aldershot's first military prison opened in 1856 and was made up of standard wooden barrack huts in the North and South Camp and holding around 200 prisoners. An 1864 report from the Inspector of Military Prisons called for the rebuilding of the military prison in cell formation 'to prevent the evils of association'. Re-building of Aldershot's military prison started in 1870 at an estimated cost of about ¬£6,000. Described in Sheldrake's Guide to Aldershot as a 'large aggressive looking building', the new prison had been constructed in the area bordered on its north and south sides by North Road and Redvers Buller Road, and to the west by James Road. The new three-storey building was very similar to conventional Victorian civil prisons such as Wormwood Scrubs and was originally designed to house 165 inmates, considerably fewer than the wooden huts of Aldershot's original prison. Additional building work was carried out to the main buildings in 1880 at a cost of about ¬£5000 while the main cell block was extended after 1885 to create a further 20 cells on each floor. In the 1930s a medical inspection unit and gymnasium were added. By 1946 the prison held between 400 and 500 prisoners which was more than double the number it had originally been designed to accommodate. This severe overcrowding caused riots on 23/24 February 1946 which led to the destruction of the main building while further damage was caused by the water from high- pressure hoses used to stop the riot. In 1948 the War Office considered rebuilding the 'Glasshouse' at an estimated cost of ¬£18,000 but eventually decided against it resulting in the prison being demolished in early 1958.The Aldershot 'Glasshouse' - Aldershot Military Museum website References Category:Aldershot Category:Buildings and structures in Aldershot Category:Military prisons Category:Demolished buildings and structures in England Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1958 ","title":"Aldershot military prison"},{"id":"57213690","text":"Disonycha figurata is a species of flea beetle in the family Chrysomelidae.

Starritt was educated at Somerville College, Oxford. He came to public attention in 2017 with the release of his novel The Beast. He was also one of the founding team on the policy platform Apolitical, which in 2018 was listed by US business magazine Fast Company as one of the World's Most Innovative Companies. Starritt has published several translations from German, including works by Stefan Zweig and Arthur Schnitzler.  The Beast  The Beast is a satire of British tabloid journalism and has been described by critics as a successor to Evelyn Waugh's novel Scoop. It tells the story of a downtrodden sub-editor, Jeremy Underwood, who notices two figures dressed in burqas outside the offices of the tabloid newspaper where he works. When he mentions this to his colleagues, their paranoia and hunger for a story take over. The Beast's journalists come to believe they are the target of an imminent terrorist attack and events quickly escalate out of control. The novel deals with themes such as the rapaciousness of the tabloids, the decline of print journalism and Islamophobia in the British media. Several critics have pointed out that as well as satire, the novel contains a great deal of affection for the world it describes. For example, the Scottish journalist Hugh Macdonald, reviewing the novel in The National, wrote, \\"This may not be a love letter to the ailing print media but it will serve as an elegy.\\"  Bibliography  = Books =  = Translations =  = TEDx lectures = *  References  Category:Living people Category:1985 births Category:Alumni of Somerville College, Oxford Category:German writers Category:Scottish writers ","title":"Alexander Starritt"},{"id":"57213733","text":"Scoloposcelis pulchella is a species of bugs in the family Lyctocoridae.

The main room boasts a 65-foot stage with an expansive installation of LED video walls as well as outdoor grand terraces. The mezzanine hosts the central bar which includes built-in seating. The venue opened as \\"the Docks Nightclub\\" n 1996. A major renovation in 2016 split the venue into four rooms: \\"The Main Room\\", \\"City Bar\\", \\"Noir\\" and the \\"Purple Room\\". The entire venue (as a whole) can house 3,700, with the concert venue holding up to 2,500 spectators. History The club has gone through several ownerships changes over the past two decades. After former Docks owner Jerry Sprackman lost his liquor licence, Polson Pier Entertainment (PPE) took over. A newly formed company called Maya Corp. applied for the liquor licence. Charles Khabouth owns 42.5 per cent of Maya, his business partner Daniel Soberano and a group controlled by PPE each own 25 per cent, and Ralph Soberano owns 7.5 per cent. Venture capitalist Michael Kimel soon entered the picture and started a new company with Khabouth and others called \\"Powerhouse\\". At the end of 2015, Khabouth began a reported $10-million renovation of the complex (which was then called Sound Academy) and the adjoining outdoor Cabana Pool Bar. After 10 months, the complex reopened under the name Rebel. The Rebel complex has four rooms, a 65-foot stage, LED video walls, a grand terrace overlooking the city skyline, and a central bar.

It was a French industrial company during the Second French Empire, whose activity was principally in sugar mills, railway locomotives and metal bridges. History The new company succeeded the Soci√©t√© Ch.Derosne et Cail, which was in difficulty following the French Revolution of 1848. The headquarters of the enterprise and the factories were in the Chaillot district at 46 Quai de Billy (now the Avenue de New York). The business capital comprised 7 million Francs, making it the largest industrial enterprise in Paris. It had a factory for locomotives and a design office at its headquarters in Chaillot. In the Grenelle district, on the other side of the Seine, and in Denain there were facilities for Forges, Casting (metalworking) and Metal fabrication that made the company self-sufficient for these demands. Other factories were in Valenciennes, Douai and Bruxelles. The factory in Chaillot had almost 1,000 employees. It was destroyed by fire in the night of 24-25 December 1865. It was not rebuilt, and its activities were transferred to the Grenelle factory. In September 1861, the Soci√©t√© J. F. Cail & Cie. started a joint venture with the newly founded company Soci√©t√© Parent, Schaken, Caillet et Cie. Two months later this cooperation took the name Participation JF Cail, Parent, Schaken, Houel et Caillet, Paris et Fives-Lille (In 1865 Parent, Schaken, Caillet et Cie became the Compagnie de Fives-Lille). This joint venture lasted until January 1870. Back on its own the Soci√©t√© J.F Cail was placed in liquidation in 1870. A new company Nouvelle Soci√©t√© J.F Cail succeeded. The Soci√©t√© J.F Cail & Cie disappeared in 1883. It was replaced by the Soci√©t√© Anonyme des Anciens √âtablissements Cail, which had its own successors.  Activities  Locomotive 4-2-0 type No 80 build in 1852 by JF Cail & Cie for the Paris-Strasbourg Railway. Locomotive M-151, 060-060T type (Meyer System) of the chemins de fer de l'H√©rault in 1872 = Sugar mills = In 1853 the company founded an annex in Bruxelles for producing machines under the name J.F. Cail, Halot et Cie. In turn this factory made a joint venture with Van Vlissingen en Dudok van Heel in Amsterdam under the name Van Vlissingen, van Heel, Derosne et Cail. This was focused on creating machines for the sugar industry. = Locomotives = The predecessor of Cail & Cie had acquired a license for producing Crampton locomotives. In the end the French Revolution of 1848 practically put an end to this production. The new company Cail & Cie then resumed production. From 1852 till 1857 it built 72 of these locomotives for regional French railroads. After 1857 the slump in internal demand was compensated by growing exports. At one time the company exported 57% of its locomotive production. In 1857 it exported locomotives to Spain and Russia. From 1866-1870 the company produced about 90 locomotives for the Chemins de Fer du Nord. It also build dozens of locomotives for other regional railroads in France. However, in general the market for locomotives declined, and competition was fierce. The Franco-Prussian War would become a turning point after which production further declined. = Bridges = The old Willemsbrug over the Meuse in Rotterdam opened in 1878 The Pont de l'Europe by Caillebotte The first bridge built by J.F Cail & Cie was the Pont d%27Arcole built in 1855 in Paris. It has a span of 80 m and was remarkable for being made of Iron instead of Cast iron. From October 1857 till July 1859 the company then built the iron bridge over the Allier in Moulins, Allier. Next came the bridges for the line from Lausanne to Fribourg. In the 1860s the factory for iron bridges in Grenelle occupied 1.8 hectares, and had 500 employees. In the 1860s the joint venture between J.F. Cail and Fives-Lille (cf above) was also effective in bridge building. In 1864 it built the Viaduc de Busseau of 56.5 m height. In 1866 the joint venture finished the Pont de l'Europe made of Structural channels and sheet metal. In 1868-1869 it built the Viaduc du Belon and the Viaduc de la Bouille for the railroad from Gannat to Commentry. The joint venture also built part of the main building of the Exposition Universelle (1867) Back on its own feet J.F. Cail company finished the Willemsbrug over the Meuse in Rotterdam in 1878.  In Culture  The factory of J.F Cail on the quay of Grenelle was painted by Gauguin in 1875. The Pont de l'Europe, was immortalized by Gustave Caillebotte in 1876.

Youth  Zaouche was born into a wealthy bourgeois family which had arrived in Tunis from Andalucia via Algeria in the eighteenth century. His father Tahar and his uncle Hassan occupied high-ranking positions under Ali Bey: they were, respectively, General of the royal guard and Brigadier-General in charge of tax-raising. He was born in his family's mansion in La Marsa to an Italian mother.Daniel Goldstein, Lib√©ration ou annexion. Aux chemins crois√©s de l‚Äôhistoire tunisienne, 1914-1922, √©d. Maison tunisienne de l‚Äô√©dition, Tunis, 1978, His secondary education was at the Coll√®ge Saint- Charles in Tunis and then the lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand in Paris where he took his baccalaur√©at. In 1894, he matriculated at the law faculty in Paris while also studying at the Institut des sciences politiques and the Coll√®ge de France. Strongly influenced by Jean Jaur√®s, he was also a pupil of √âmile Durkheim, √âmile Boutroux, Henri Poincar√©, Antoine Aulard and Ernest Lavisse.Sadok Zmerli, Figures tunisiennes. Les successeurs, √©d. Maison tunisienne de l'√©dition, Tunis, 1967, He graduated in law and returned to Tunis in 1900 where he involved himself in public affairs. In 1901, together with the Ramella brothers, he founded a flour mill, and in 1903 he hosted a visit by Muhammad Abduh. In 1903 he set up the first scientific press in the Arab world, Al Matb√¢a Al Ilmiya.  Economic reform and political campaigns Letter from Mustafa Kamil Pasha to Zaouche (1906) Zaouche was noted for the emphasis he placed on economic issues - agriculture, manufactures and trade. He devoted much of his work to advancing professional qualifications, management standards, creativity and competitiveness. In 1908 Zaouche took part in the first mixed session of the Tunisian Consultative Conference and chose to be a rapporteur and member of the Finance Commission of the Tunisian section of this body. From its first session, Zaouche demanded the suppression of the mejba (poll tax), which accounted for a sixth of the government's income and was used to pay a number of officials. including ca√Øds, khalifas and cheikhs. Tunisia's declining agriculture made the mejba ever more unbearable to the people, and had triggered a number of uprisings, including the major Mejba Revolt of 1864-65. His proposals for replacement sources of public income included reductions in taxes on labour and increases in taxes on (colonial) capital as well as on mining and extractive industries.Interventions personnelles des 11 et 19 novembre 1907 √† la Conf√©rence consultative. These proposals were vigorously opposed by the French colonials who dominated the Conference. In 1910, a loan was proposed to fund the extension of the railway network, which was to be repaid by additional taxes on the Tunisian population. Zaouche used this as an opportunity to renew his attacks on French capital, arguing that the infrastructure paid for by ordinary Tunisians would bring them little benefit.Rapports sur l'emprunt de la ligne de chemin de fer publi√©s par la Conf√©rence consultative en 1910 If a loan was to be taken out, he argued, part of it should directly benefit Tunisians by being invested in schools and basic training.Rapport sur l'√©conomie et l'apprentissage publi√© par la Conf√©rence consultative en 1910 Zaouche also served as a member of the Higher Government Council (Conseil Sup√©rieur du Gouvernement) (1911-1912) as well as on various bodies such as the Commission for the Revival of Indigenous Arts, and the Mixed (i.e. Franco- Tunisian) Commission for the Coll√®ge Sadiki. At the same time, Zaouche spoke out about issues in public administration and argued for republican principles. He sought to preserve the integrity and distinctiveness of Tunisian institutions by emphasising the importance of appointing individuals of competence, probity and independence. He was a co-founder of the Coll√®ge Sadiki alumni association and of the Cercle tunisien (an intellectual club interested in current affairs which sought to articulate the defence of Tunisian interests), and President of the Khaldounia. He was also a shareholder and board member of a number of newspapers, including La D√©p√™che tunisienne, Le Progr√®s, La Poste tunisienne, L'Autonome and, in Paris, of Le Temps. Zaouche also edited a number of articles for the socialist daily Le Lib√©ral. He was one of the founders of the nationalist Young Tunisian movement, and had links with the Young Turks, with reforming Egyptian nationalists such as Muhammad Abduh and Mustafa Kamil Pasha, as well as with supporters of panarabism like Pierre Loti and Charles G√©niaux. For the five years that Le Tunisien was published, he campaigned alongside Ali Bach Hamba ‚Äî whose first cousin Ch√©rifa he married ‚Äî and other Young Tunisians, producing a steady stream of articles highly critical of the French Protectorate of Tunisia.  Educational reform  B√©chir Sfar, Zaouche et Mohamed Lasram at the Khaldounia (1908) School for Tunisian girls in 1914 For Abdeljelil Zaouche, education was the key to reviving economic growth and social stability. It was the only means of ensuring that positions in the civil service would be opened to Tunisians (from which they were excluded at the time) and a necessary prelude to building a competent and independent judiciary. Zaouche summarised his position by citing Danton: \\"After bread, education is the first need of the people.\\" Tunisians, he argued, needed a basic education in the Arabic language, \\"to preserve his place in his own country.\\" He also advocated reformed kouttab schools and mixed Franco-Arab institutions.Abdeljelil Zaouche, L'enseignement arabe en Tunisie, tome XX, √©d. Soci√©t√© d'√©ditions maritimes et coloniales, Paris, 1932 He also argued for access for Tunisians to modern education institutions both in Tunisia and in France. He published a number of brochures, including \\"Native education\\" (L'enseignement des indig√®nes) (1900) and \\"The Franco-Arab School\\" in which he argued for education for both sexes and all classes. The education of women was a theme to which he frequently returned in his speaking and writing,Propos d'Abdeljelil Zaouche tenus lors du Congr√®s de l'Afrique du nord organis√© √† Paris en 1908 and which was also taken up by other Young Tunisian spokesmen such as Sadok Zmerli and Khairallah Ben Mustapha.Propos de Khairallah Ben Mustapha tenus lors du Congr√®s de l'Afrique du nord organis√© √† Paris en 1908 He was a member of the Commission on the Modernisation of Teaching at the University of Ez-Zitouna after the student strike of 1910, as well as on the mixed (Franco-Tunisian) Commission for the Reform of Sadiki College. He denounced the discrimination faced by Tunisian students who wished to study at the Lyc√©e Carnot de Tunis, which was the only institution giving access to modern university studies.  Reform of agriculture and manufacture  After the destruction of the First World War and the fall in French agricultural production, the French colonists stepped up the expropriation of land in Tunisia, soon controlling 4m hectares, or 20% of the cultivable land. Zaouche, a member of the Commission for Property Law, worked to safeguard Tunisian landholdings and modernise farming methods. He also advocated measures to make credit more easily available to small farmers, and to build up a resilient social infrastructure of cooperatives. Provident societies could be established following a 1907 decree, but their formalities and restrictions meant that funding for farmers was both limited and slow. In 1913 he spoke in favour of the creation of Tunisian Chamber of Agriculture to represent the interests of small farmers and retailers to the government. The French protectorate of Tunisia allowed tariff-free imports for French goods, which often undercut local manufacturers. Foreign industries set up in Tunisia and local craftsmen and manufacturers could not complete. The general economic decline this created was greatly resented by Zaouche. He argued forcefully for education and training to allow local businesses to reskill, and for access to credit on modest terms to allow them to retool and explore new markets. He also spoke in favour of tariff protection for local markets and export incentives for Tunisian manufacturers to export into French Algeria. He argued for comprehensive legislation to protect workers, providing for equality in access to positions, salaries and taxation; for the creation of professional bodies and the establishment of a self-regulating industrial and commercial sector. He foresaw new cooperatives, new municipal institutions and new, modern technical education as the keys to future success. He was instrumental in getting the small shopkeepers (Djerbiens) to form a cooperative to buy goods in bulk at a discount. He also created the Es-Saadia cooperative, with more than 800 balgha-makers in Tunis and more than 100 in Kairouan, purchasing raw materials and supporting training and the well-being of its members.Propos tenus dans la Revue du monde musulman en 1907 The success of the Es-Saadia cooperative encouraged the grocers and ironmongers to for a Commercial Union that he led himself. Parallel social organisations emerged in other sectors, including Le Progr√®s (woolen cloth) in 1910, Ikbal (foodstuffs) in 1911, Les Soci√©t√©s tunisiennes in 1912, Itidal (glassware) in 1913, l'Aide mutuelle (grains et spices) in 1914 and La Renaissance √©conomique (farming equipment) in 1920.  The Jellaz Affair Abdeljelil Zaouche during the Jellaz trial The Jellaz Affair was a controversy which broke out in 1911 over a proposal by the City Council of Tunis to register the land. Zaouche, a member of the Council, raised the alarm at one of its sessions, warning of a huge public backlash. The Council withdrew the proposal and Zaouche went to the cemetery in person to try and prevent violence, but such was the anger and tension that several days of riots across the city, in which several people lost their lives. Victor de Carni√®res, leader of the French colonists and owner of the newspaper Colon fran√ßais, used the edition of 26 November 1911 to accuse Zaouche of being the main instigator of the disturbances.Mary Dewhurst Lewis, Divided Rule: Sovereignty and Empire in French Tunisia, 1881-1938, Univ of California Press 2013 p.108 On 30 November Zaouche replied in his own newspaper, Le Tunisien, accusing Carni√®res of defamation. After unsuccessful attempts to have these accusations dealt with by other administrative or judicial means, Zaouche brought a case against him. Carni√®res' defence was that he was relying on rumours he had picked up from Tunisians. The presiding judge described Zaouche as 'a man of good' and the Attorney General described his actions as worthy only of praise. Nevertheless, the court simply dismissed the case on the grounds that anything damaging Carni√®res had said about Zaouche was only of secondary importance, and that his primary aim had been to defend French interests. The court also ruled that Zaouche should pay the costs of the action, which tended to support the view among colonists that the accusations were well-founded. Exonerated by the court, Carni√®res continued his attacks on Zaouche and the Young Tunisians in his newspaper. Zaouche pursued the matter at the Court of Appeal in Algiers, where Carni√®res' standing in the settler community in Tunis counted for less. The Algiers court found in Zaouche's favour and awarded him costs with interest against Carni√®res, taking into account his bad faith and his intention to defame. However the court also decided, 'considering the circumstances' not to announce its decision in the Tunis newspapers, which meant that it went largely unnoticed.'Colons fran√ßais et Jeunes-Tunisiens (1882-1912)' p.148 accessed 29/12/2016  High office  Zaouche in ministerial uniform From April 1917 Zaouche served for 17 years as ca√Ød of Sousse, but did not abandon the cause of the national movement. He published many reports on education and agriculture, and created special support funds for the farmers of the Sahel and encouraged the planting of olive trees. On 18 May 1934 he became Mayor of Tunis and on 7 October 1935, Minister of the Pen. From April 1936 until the confrontation with the French Resident General Esteva in December 1942, he was Minister of Justice. He resigned from this position in protest, together with all the other ministers in the cabinet of H√©di Lakhoua at the request of the Bey. Founder of the co- operative movement, reformer, lawyer, editor, journalist, businessman and minister, Zaouche was also one of the most outspoken Young Tunisians when it came to criticising traditional religion. He was somewhat isolated from the Sadikian group among the Young Tumisians because he spent his time in mainstream French institutions. His old opponent, the colonist leader Victor de Carni√®res hailed him as ‚ÄúYoung Tunisian, hothouse plant, two centuries ahead of his co-religionists.‚Äù  References   Bibliography  = Biographies = * Tawfik Ayadi, Mouvement r√©formiste et mouvements populaires √† Tunis, √©d.

She is of Filipino descent. Her life is featured in the National Museum of African American History and Culture at the Smithsonian and she was recorded by the Library of Congress regarding her experiences with civil rights in the United States. In the 1940s and 1950s, she served as a stenographer and private secretary for the NAACP in Washington D.C. and was married to Thurgood Marshall, the first African- American U.S. Supreme Court Justice, from 1955 until his death in 1993.  Biography  Cecilia \\"Cissy\\" Suyat was born in Pu'unene, Maui, in Hawaii on July 20, 1928. Her parents emigrated from the Philippines in 1910. Her father owned a printing company and her mother died when she was young. She was raised in Hawaii with many siblings. Suyat moved to New York City to live with her maternal uncle and aunt, on the advice of her father, before starting work for the NAACP in Washington D.C. In her first assignment, she picketed the movie The Birth of a Nation at a local theater, which soon stopped playing the movie. Suyat took night classes at Columbia University to become a court stenographer and eventually became the private secretary of Dr. Gloster B. Current, the head of the NAACP, from 1948-55. She played a role in the historic Brown v. Board of Education case. Suyat met Thurgood Marshall, then married him in 1955 after Marshall's previous wife, Vivian Burey, died of lung cancer. Suyat married Marshall on Dec. 17, 1955. Roy Wilkins, who was secretary of the NAACP, presided over the service at St. Philip‚Äôs Episcopal Church in Harlem, New York. Visitors to their apartment included Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks. Suyat and Marshall are the parents of John W. Marshall, a former Virginia Secretary of Public Safety and former U.S. Marshals Service Director, and Thurgood Marshall Jr. Juan Williams reported Suyat worked extensively in Marshall's later years to keep his explosions of \\"frustration with the conservative court and what remained of the Civil Rights Movement\\" out of the public, afraid they would embarrass him. Suyat has spent her life preserving history and has continued to fight for civil rights after her husband's death, which she believes still has a long way to go. She gave an oral history interview for the Library of Congress conducted by Emilye Crosby in Washington, D.C. on June 30, 2013. Her story is now featured in the National Museum of African American History and Culture at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. The interview was authorized by the U. S. Congress on May 12, 2009, in the Civil Rights History Project Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-19). The exhibit was created as part of a 5-year initiative to survey existing oral history collections with relevance to the Civil Rights Movement and record new interviews with people who participated in the social and political movement.

The station played a significant role in beaming taped Yoruba traveling theatre productions to households. In 1975, the Federal Government of Nigeria established Nigerian Television Authority network service and acquired all T.V. stations in Nigeria to form the network. WNTS then became NTA Ibadan. WNTS was created as a partnership between the Western regional government and a foreign firm. It was designed to be an educational tool for the masses and also a medium to beam local culture, foreign news and aims of the government to the homes of people in the region. Establishment of the station was enhanced by a constitutional change that removed broadcasting from an exclusive item to a concurrent item and political resolution of the regional premier, Obafemi Awolowo and the regional minister of Information, Anthony Enahoro. WNTV was a partnership between Overseas Rediffusion and the Western regional government. The first television broadcast was on October 31, 1959. In 1962, the government parted ways with its foreign partner, WNTV solely came under the control of the regional government. The change in ownership structure from a mixture of social and commercial interest to solely social and political interest made WNTV an organ of government information and tool of the party in power. News programs such as WNTV News, Highlight were the ratings powerhouse of the station. Between 1959 and 1964, imported dramas dominated programming and reruns of children shows such as Adventures of Robin Hood, Cisco Kid, Hop Along Cassidy were popular among children. Beginning in 1962, the station increased audience through outreach programs in rural areas and schools starting with Omi-Adio Lalupon TV viewing project where TV sets powered by generators were purchased for joint viewing at rural community centers. The station had two educative programs that were well received News and You, a current affairs discussion program produced by Christopher Kolade and the Ministry of Education and Careers, a show that featured people in their various occupations. During this period there was little measurable statistics but the station played a pivotal role of promoting Yoruba traveling theatre. It taped and beamedDuro Ladipo's play including ·ªåba k√≤ so for television viewing and a popular series Bode Waasimi. In the 1970s, it broadcast popular shows like Alawada by the Alawada Group that included Moses Olaiya also known as Baba Sala. In 1976, Kootu Asipa by Duro Ladipo was a popular drama.

The medical team and the child's parents disagreed about whether to maintain Evans's life support or to withdraw it, resulting in a legal battle. Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust sought a declaration that continued ventilatory support was \\"unkind and inhumane\\", and not in Evans's best interests. Alfie's parents, Kate James and Thomas Evans, contested the application. The ventilatory support was removed on 23 April 2018 following a series of unsuccessful appeals from Alfie's family. Alfie continued to breathe naturally for five days after the removal of his breathing tube. He died at 2:30 a.m. on 28 April 2018.  Treatment  Alder Hey Children's Hospital, where Alfie Evans was treated from December 2016 until his death. In November 2016, at six months of age, Alfie Evans was reviewed at the general pediatric outpatient clinic at Alder Hey Children's Hospital. He was found to be functioning in a range appropriate for a 6-week to 2-month-old infant. On 14 December 2016, Alfie was admitted to Alder Hey Accident and Emergency Department with a history of coughing, high temperature, and a reported episode of rhythmic jerking of his jaw and all four limbs. On 15 December, he showed sudden unprovoked movements compatible with infantile/epileptic spasms. An EEG performed on 16 December 2016 confirmed hypsarrhythmia. A further EEG was taken in January 2017 and \\"was markedly different, showing attenuation with little in the way of reactive response for protracted periods of time. Changes only really occurred when Alfie had an epileptic seizure.\\" Alfie's parents wished to remove him from Alder Hey and seek further care at the Bambino Ges√π Hospital in Rome. In September 2017, Italian doctors from Bambino Ges√π Hospital produced an assessment report on the possibility of transferring Alfie to Italy. According to their report on the case, they could offer prolonged ventilator support, with a surgical tracheostomy and would remove a nasogastric tube, replacing it with a gastrostomy. During assessment, Alfie suffered \\"epileptic seizures induced by proprioceptive stimuli\\", the report warned \\"due to stimulations related to the transportation and flight, those seizures might induce further damage to the brain, [putting] the whole procedure of transportation at risk.\\" Alfie remained in Alder Hey Hospital for the duration of 2017, with no improvement in his condition. At the end of the year, the hospital applied to have life support switched off.  Publicity and public reaction  Alfie Evans's case drew significant public attention in the United Kingdom and overseas, with his parents establishing \\"Alfie's Army\\", an online campaign group dedicated to seeking further treatment and opposing the withdrawal of life support. Supporters established a petition on change.org, calling on Alder Hey Hospital to allow Alfie Evans to be transferred to a hospital of his parents' choice. His parents also approached Dr Michio Hirano, a US-based neurologist who had offered treatment in the case of Charlie Gard. Alfie's parents claimed a parental right to make decisions about their son's care, arguing that the hospital itself should not be able to make care- decisions for their son without their consent. Large protests emerged outside Alder Hey Hospital on 12 April after his family insisted on their right to take him home. On 16 April, Merseyside Police launched an investigation into \\"instances of verbal abuse and acts of intimidation\\" with judges raising concerns about threatening conduct by protesters towards hospital staff. Alfie's parents apologised, saying they did not intend to \\"harm or cause conflict or upset\\". Merseyside Police Chief Inspector Chris Gibson released a statement regarding social media posts regarding the Alder Hey Hospital and Alfie Evans's situation: \\"malicious communications and threatening behaviour will be investigated and, where necessary, will be acted upon.\\" = Overseas support = On 18 April 2018 Alfie's father flew to Rome for a 20-minute meeting with Pope Francis. The case was commented on by the Pope via Twitter, who stated his \\"sincere hope that everything necessary may be done in order to continue compassionately accompanying little Alfie Evans, and that the deep suffering of his parents may be heard.\\" He restated his support after the removal of life support, saying \\"Moved by the prayers and immense solidarity shown little Alfie Evans, I renew my appeal that the suffering of his parents may be heard and that their desire to seek new forms of treatment may be granted.\\" The President of Poland Andrzej Duda also expressed his support. On 23 April, Alfie was granted Italian citizenship under the request of Brothers of Italy's leader Giorgia Meloni. The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it hoped Alfie would be allowed \\"immediate transfer to Italy\\".  Legal proceedings  On 19 December 2017, Alder Hey applied to the High Court to withdraw parental rights from Alfie's parents and to withdraw ventilation. The case was heard at a public hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London. Alder Hey claimed that continuing life-support treatment would not be in the best interests of Alfie and sought declaration that \\"is not lawful that such treatment continue\\". Lawyers acting on the hospital's behalf further claimed that further treatment for Alfie would be \\"unkind and inhumane\\". A doctor treating Alfie further stated that there was \\"no hope\\" for the child, and that he was in a semi-vegetative state from a degenerative neurological condition that medics have not been able to definitively identify. The parents denied this, with Alfie's father claiming that his son \\"looks him in the eye\\" and \\"wants help\\". The High Court ruled in favour of the hospital on 20 February 2018. In their judgement, the High Court stated that an MRI scan taken in February 2018 revealed that \\"[Alfie's] brain [was] entirely beyond recovery\\" and that \\"the brain was now only able to generate seizure\\" with \\"progressive destruction of the white matter of the brain which Dr R interpreted as now appearing almost identical to water and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\\" The Court noted that the medical consensus, including of doctors asked to testify by the parents, was that Alfie had a fatal and untreatable condition, but they differed over the best course of action concerning his end-of-life care. High Court judge Mr Justice Anthony Hayden concluded that \\"I am satisfied that continued ventilatory support is no longer in Alfie's best interest\\". =Appeals= Alfie's parents appealed against the decision in late February. On 6 March, the Court of Appeal upheld the earlier ruling of the High Court. They stated that the High Court judge was \\"meticulous and thorough\\", and that medical evidence showed Alfie was \\"deeply comatose\\" and \\"to all intents and purposes unaware of his surroundings\\". The parents applied to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom on 20 March, which refused the right for another appeal. On 28 March the European Court of Human Rights ruled the case inadmissible, finding no violation of human rights. In a High Court judgement of 11 April 2018, the judge remarked that \\"by the end of February the connective pathways within the white matter of the brain which facilitate rudimentary sensation ‚Äî hearing, touch, taste and sight, had been obliterated. They were no longer even identifiable on the MRI scan\\". The High Court backed an end-of-life care plan drawn up by medical specialists attached to Alfie Evans's case. Alfie's father said that Alfie was wrongly \\"detained\\" at Alder Hey. High Court judge Hayden dismissed that complaint, and appeal judges upheld his decision. On 17 April Mr Evans and Ms James asked the Supreme Court to consider their case again. Their application to appeal was refused on 20 April. The justices wrote, \\"Alfie looks like a normal baby, but the unanimous opinion of the doctors who have examined him and the scans of his brain is that almost all of his brain has been destroyed. No-one knows why. But that it has happened and is continuing to happen cannot be denied. [...] there is no hope of his ever getting better.\\" The European Court of Human Rights again determined their appeal on these grounds to be inadmissible. The case concerned the family's argument that the prevention of Alfie's transfer from Alder Hey Hospital constituted deprivation of liberty and a violation of Article 5 (right to liberty and security) of the European Convention on Human Rights. The decision resulted in a protest of at least 200 people taking place outside of Alder Hey hospital. =Withdrawal of life support= On 23 April, it was reported that Alfie's life support had been withdrawn. Alfie continued to breathe after the removal of his breathing tube, although his parents gave conflicting reports, at one time claiming they needed to perform mouth-to- mouth resuscitation. Other than a post on social media no evidence of mouth- to-mouth ever being performed has ever been made public. Alfie's father stated to the media the next morning that Alfie had been breathing unassisted since shortly after life-support had been withdrawn, and that life-support should be reinstated.Alfie Evans's father reveals son has been breathing unassisted after life support stops, The Telegraph, 24 April 2018. The evening of the same day, High Court judge Justice Hayden rejected the parents' appeal for permission to fly their son to a hospital in Italy. The judge concluded how previously he had come, \\"the consensus of every doctor from every country who had ever evaluated Alfie's condition, to the inevitable conclusion (following 7 days of evidence) that Alfie's brain had been so corroded by his Neurodegenerative Brain Disorder that there was simply no prospect of recovery. By the time I requested the updated MRI scan in February, the signal intensity was so bright that it revealed a brain that had been almost entirely wiped out. In simple terms the brain consisted only of water and CSF. [...] All that could be offered by the Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome was an alternative palliative care plan.\\" According to the Liverpool Echo, Alfie's father told reporters later that evening that the court had said it could set aside three judges that evening to hear his case again.Alfie Evans latest: Parents say they had to keep him alive using mouth to mouth resuscitation, Liverpool Echo, 24 April 2018. On 25 April, the appeal was rejected. Alfie Evans's father sought to issue a private prosecution alleging \\"conspiracy for murder\\" against several staff members at Alder Hey.https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/alfie-evans-father-tom-evans-bids-to- bring-private-prosecution-against-three-of-his-sons-doctors-a3823946.html A statement had been prepared by Pavel Stroilov of the Christian Legal Centre, but was rejected by a district judge. On 26 April, Mr Evans issued a statement, thanking supporters, and staff at Alder Hey Hospital. He stated the family wished to \\"form a relationship, build a bridge and walk across it\\" with the hospital where their son has been treated and work with the treating team on a \\"plan that provides our boy with the dignity and comfort that he needs\\". Outcome Alfie died at 2:30 a.m. on 28 April 2018. Later that day his father, Tom Evans, released a statement on Facebook announcing his death: \\"My gladiator lay down his shield and gained his wings... absolutely heartbroken.\\" References Category:2018 controversies Category:2017 in British law Category:2018 in British law Category:Medical controversies in the United Kingdom Category:Medical lawsuits ","title":"Alfie Evans case"},{"id":"57214236","text":"Vivian \\"Buster\\" Burey Marshall (February 11, 1911 ‚Äì February 11, 1955) was an American civil rights activist and was married for 25 years, until her death, to Thurgood Marshall, lead counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, who also managed Brown v. Board of Education (1954). Following her death, her husband was later appointed as the first African-American U.S. Supreme Court Justice.  Biography  Vivian Burey was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on February 11, 1911. She grew up in a middle-class black family; her parents Christopher and Maud Burey worked in catering in the city. She attended local schools. She met Thurgood Marshall at age eighteen, while she was a student at the University of Pennsylvania and he was a student at nearby Lincoln University. Buster married Thurgood Marshall on September 4, 1929, during Marshall's last year at Lincoln. She is credited with helping her husband become a better student. Buster's husband graduated cum laude and went on to graduate first in his law class at Howard University. Upon meeting his family after they were engaged, Buster was warned by Marshall's uncle to avoid Marshall because he was a bum, and would \\"always be a bum.\\" After Buster's husband Thurgood graduated from college in 1930, they moved to Baltimore where she worked as a secretary. Burey had several miscarriages during her marriage and never had any children. Her husband had some affairs. After Buster's husband completed law school, they moved to New York. In the mid-1940s he served as legal counsel for the NAACP, which was then based in New York. Buster also worked at the NAACP, alongside other civil rights activists such as Edward W. Jacko and Jawn A. Sandifer. In the 1950s, Marshall was diagnosed with flu or pleurisy, but was sick for months. She eventually learned that she had lung cancer. She hid her sickness from her husband for months, as he was leading the case of Brown v. Board of Education at the US Supreme Court. After it ruled on May 17, 1954, Marshall told her husband about her illness. Richard Kluger credits Burey with being one of two people who had been indirectly active but important influencers of the Brown v. Board of Education decision, in his book, Simple Justice: The History of Brown v. Board of Education and Black America's Struggle for Equality (2011). Marshall died of lung cancer on February 11, 1955, her 44th birthday, after 25 years of marriage. Marshall's husband remarried in December 1955, to Cecilia Suyat, a woman who worked as a secretary at the NAACP headquarters.  Legacy  Named in her memory, the Vivian Burey Marshall Academy was founded in 2016 as a program of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. It pairs students with U.S. Army scientists and engineers to encourage their studies in STEM. It serves students grades 6‚Äì10 in the Baltimore, Maryland, and Vicksburg, Mississippi, areas with a focus on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) learning programs. The 2017 movie Marshall is a Thurgood Marshall biopic about his early career, directed by Reginald Hudlin. It featured Keesha Sharp as Vivian Marshall.

Although sporadic efforts have taken place since the war began in 2001, negotiations and the peace movement intensified in 2018 amid talks between the Taliban, which is the main insurgent group fighting against the Afghan government and American troops; and the United States, of which 20,000 soldiers maintain a presence within the country to support the Afghan government. The Taliban also attack civilian targets. Most of the talks have taken place in Doha, the capital of Qatar, where a Taliban office is based. It is expected that a mutual agreement between the Taliban and the United States would be followed by a phased American withdrawal and the start of intra-Afghan peace talks. Besides the United States, regional powers such as Pakistan, China and Russia, as well as NATO play a part in facilitating the peace process. On February 29, 2020, the U.S. signed a conditional peace agreement with the Taliban, which calls for the withdrawal of foreign troops in 14 months if the Taliban uphold the terms of the agreement. On March 1, 2020, however, the Afghan government, which was not a party to the deal, rejected the U.S. and Taliban's call for a prisoner swap by March 10, 2020, with President Ashraf Ghani stating that such an agreement will require further negotiation and will also not be implemented as a precondition for future peace negotiations.https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/01/afghan-peace-deal- prisoner-release-118473title=Afghan peace deal hits first snag over prisoner releasesauthor=Associated Presspublisher=Politicoaccessdate=March 1, 2020}} On March 10, 2020, Ghani signed a decree agreeing to swap 1,500 Taliban prisoners starting March 14, 2020, but on the condition that they sign pledges agreeing to not return to combat. The same day, it was also revealed that there were no plans for a full U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. On March 10, the United Nations Security Council unanimously backed the U.S.-Taliban peace deal. On March 11, 2020, however, the Taliban rejected Ghani's prisoner swap proposal. On March 14, 2020 the U.S.-Taliban peace deal became endangered when Ghani delayed the release of Taliban prisoners. On April 7, 2020 The Taliban officially withdrew from prisoner swap talks, which had been taking place in Kabul starting 30 March 2020 and only resulted in the release of 100 Taliban prisoners on 8 April 2020. On May 13, 2020, following a spike in violence, President Ghani ordered the Afghan military to resume offensive against the Taliban.  Background  The Taliban, which refers to itself as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, is a Sunni Islamic organization that operates in Afghanistan, a country in Central/South Asia. The Taliban emerged in 1994, taking advantage of the power vacuum that was left following the aftermath of the Afghan Civil War. The group was mainly composed of religious students in Pakistani madrassas (who had fought in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War) under the leadership of Mohammed Omar. Al-Qaeda, an international terrorist network, were granted sanctuary in Afghanistan on the condition that it did not antagonize the United States, but Osama bin Laden reneged on the agreement in 1998 when he orchestrated bombings of US embassies in East Africa. The episode was indicative of tensions that emerged between the two groups. The Taliban was fundamentally parochial while Al-Qaeda had its sights set on global jihad. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. under President George W. Bush made a request to the Taliban leadership to hand over Osama bin Laden, who was the prime suspect in the attacks. The Taliban refused to hand bin Laden over, demanding evidence of his participation in the attacks. Consequently, the U.S., together with its NATO allies, launched the United States invasion of Afghanistan, code-named Operation Enduring Freedom, on October 7, 2001. By December 17 that year, the U.S. and its allies had driven the Taliban from power and begun building military bases near major cities across the country. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was later created by the United Nations Security Council to train Afghan National Security Forces to oversee military operations in the country so as to prevent any resurgence of the Taliban group. The Taliban has launched numerous attacks on the Afghan forces, government facilities, and any organization that they believe are in alliance with the US. The US has been on the ground and directly involved in the war for 18 years, with analysts describing the situation as a stalemate. Although al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan are now considered to be \\"diminished\\", the war with the Taliban insurgents continues. Ending the 18-year conflict has eluded former US presidents, and Donald Trump has said that he considers the war too costly. Similarities with the process to end the Vietnam War‚ÄîAmerica's longest war prior to 2010‚Äîhave been noted, which resulted in the Paris Peace Accords in 1973. Negotiations =2007‚Äì2016= Negotiations had long been advocated by the former Afghan President, Hamid Karzai, as well as the British and Pakistani governments, but resisted by the American government. Karzai offered peace talks with the Taliban in September 2007, but this was swiftly rejected by the insurgent group citing the presence of foreign troops. By 2009 there was broad agreement in Afghanistan that the war should end, but how it should happen was a major issue for the candidates of the 2009 Afghan presidential election that re-elected Karzai. In a televised speech after being elected, Karzai called on \\"our Taliban brothers to come home and embrace their land\\" and laid plans to launch a loya jirga. Efforts were undermined by the Obama administration's increase of American troops in the country. Karzai reiterated at a London conference in January 2010 that he wanted to reach out to the Taliban to lay down arms. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cautiously supported the proposal. At the United States Institute of Peace in May 2010, Karzai stated that a \\"peace process\\" would be with the Taliban and other militants \\"who are not part of al-Qaeda or other terrorist networks or ideologically against us\\". Of the Taliban specifically, he stated, \\"They're countryside boys who don't hate the United States, perhaps a lot of them would like to visit the United States given the opportunity\\". The Taliban's co-founder and then-second-in-command, Abdul Ghani Baradar, was one of the leading Taliban members who favored talks with the US and Afghan governments. Karzai's administration reportedly held talks with Baradar in February 2010; however, later that month, Baradar was captured in a joint US-Pakistani raid in the city of Karachi in Pakistan. The arrest infuriated Karzai and invoked suspicions that he was seized because the Pakistani intelligence community was opposed to Afghan peace talks. The Afghan Peace Jirga 2010 took place in June 2010, however the Taliban did not attend the conference. A mindset change and strategy occurred within the Obama administration in 2010 to allow possible political negotiations to solve the war. The Taliban themselves had refused to speak to the Afghan government, portraying them as an American \\"puppet\\". Sporadic efforts for peace talks between the US and the Taliban occurred afterward, and it was reported in October 2010 that Taliban leadership commanders (the \\"Quetta Shura\\") had left their haven in Pakistan and been safely escorted to Kabul by NATO aircraft for talks, with the assurance that NATO staff would not apprehend them. After the talks concluded, it emerged that the leader of this delegation, who claimed to be Akhtar Mansour, the second-in-command of the Taliban, was actually an imposter who had duped NATO officials. Karzai confirmed in June 2011 that secret talks were taking place between the US and the Taliban, but these collapsed by August 2011. Further attempts to resume talks were canceled in March 2012, and June 2013 following a dispute between the Afghan government and the Taliban regarding the latter's opening of a political office in Qatar. President Karzai accused the Taliban of portraying themselves as a government in exile. In January 2016, Pakistan hosted a round of four-way talks with Afghan, Chinese and American officials, but the Taliban did not attend. The Taliban did hold informal talks with the Afghan government in 2016. =Since 2017= US President Donald Trump accused Pakistan of harboring the Taliban and of inaction against terrorists, first in August 2017 then repeated the accusations in January 2018. On February 27, 2018, following an increase in violence, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani proposed unconditional peace talks with the Taliban, offering them recognition as a legal political party and the release of the Taliban prisoners. The offer was the most favorable to the Taliban since the war started. It was preceded by months of national consensus building, which found that Afghans overwhelmingly supported a negotiated end to the war. Two days earlier, the Taliban had called for talks with the US, saying \\"It must now be established by America and her allies that the Afghan issue cannot be solved militarily. America must henceforth focus on a peaceful strategy for Afghanistan instead of war.\\" On March 27, 2018, a conference of 20 countries in Tashkent, Uzbekistan backed the Afghan government's peace offer to the Taliban. However, the Taliban did not publicly respond to Ghani's offer. A growing peace movement arose in Afghanistan during 2018, particularly following a peace march which the Afghan media dubbed the \\"Helmand Peace Convoy\\". The peace march was a response to a car bomb on March 23 in Lashkar Gah that killed 14 people. The marchers walked several hundred miles from Lashkar Gah in Helmand Province, through Taliban-held territory, to Kabul. There they met Ghani and held sit-in protests outside the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and nearby embassies. Their efforts inspired further movements in other parts of Afghanistan. Following the march, Ghani and the Taliban agreed a mutual ceasefire during the Eid al-Fitr celebrations in June 2018. During the Eid ceasefire, Taliban members flocked into Kabul where they met and communicated with locals and state security forces. Although civilians called for the ceasefire to be made permanent, the Taliban rejected an extension and resumed fighting after the ceasefire ended on June 18, while the Afghan government's ceasefire ended a week later. American officials secretly met Taliban members in July 2018, at the latter's political office in Qatar. In September 2018, Trump appointed Zalmay Khalilzad as special adviser on Afghanistan in the US State Department, with the stated goal of facilitating an intra-Afghan political peace process. Khalilzad led further talks between the US and the Taliban in Qatar in October 2018. Russia hosted a separate peace talk in November 2018 between the Taliban and officials from Afghanistan's High Peace Council. The talks in Qatar resumed in December 2018, though the Taliban refused to allow the Afghan government to be invited, considering them a puppet government of the US. The Taliban spoke with Afghans including former President Hamid Karzai, held at a hotel in Moscow in February 2019, but again these talks did not include the Afghan government. A further round of talks in Qatar were held in February 2019, this time including Baradar in the Taliban delegation  he had been released by Pakistan in October 2018 at the US' request. Khalilzad reported that this round of negotiations was \\"more productive than they have been in the past\\" and that a draft version of a peace agreement had been agreed. The deal involved the withdrawal of US and international troops from Afghanistan and the Taliban not allowing other jihadist groups to operate within the country. The Taliban also announced that progress was being made in the negotiations. A delegation of Taliban officials and senior Afghan politicians met in Moscow for peace talks in February and May 2019. Reuters reported that \\"Russian officials as well as religious leaders and elders had asked for a ceasefire.\\" Between April 29 and May 3, 2019, the Afghan government hosted a four-day loya jirga to discuss peace talks. The Taliban were invited but did not attend. Later in May, a third meeting was held in Moscow between a Taliban delegation and a group of Afghan politicians. An eighth round of US-Taliban talks in Qatar was held in August 2019. The Washington Post reported that the US was close to reaching a peace deal with the Taliban and was preparing to withdraw 5,000 troops from Afghanistan. In September, Khalilzad stated that an agreement had been reached by the US and the Taliban, pending approval by Trump. However, less than a week later, Trump canceled the peace talks in response to an attack in Kabul that killed an American soldier and 11 other people. Following the collapse of the talks with the US, the Taliban sent a delegation to Russia to discuss prospects for a withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. On September 18, 2019, the Taliban stated that their \\"doors are open\\" should Trump decide to resume peace talks in the future. Peace negotiations resumed in December 2019, leading to a seven-day partial ceasefire which began on February 22, 2020. 2020 agreement US representative Zalmay Khalilzad (left) and Taliban representative Abdul Ghani Baradar (right) sign the agreement in Doha, Qatar on February 29, 2020 On February 29, 2020, the United States and the Taliban signed a peace agreement in Doha, Qatar. The provisions of the deal include the withdrawal of all American and NATO troops from Afghanistan, a Taliban pledge to prevent al- Qaeda from operating in areas under Taliban control, and talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government. The United States agreed to an initial reduction of its force level from 13,000 to 8,600 by July 2020, followed by a full withdrawal within 14 months if the Taliban keeps its commitments. The United States also committed to closing five military bases within 135 days, and expressed its intent to end economic sanctions on the Taliban by August 27, 2020. The resulting intra-Afghan negotiations were scheduled to begin on March 10, 2020 in Oslo, Norway. The composition of the Afghan government negotiating team has not yet been determined, because the results of the 2019 Afghan presidential election are disputed. The deal requires the Afghan government to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners by the start of the talks, in a prisoner exchange for 1,000 government soldiers held by the Taliban. The Afghan government was not a party to the deal, and on March 1 Ghani stated that he would reject the prisoner exchange: \\"The government of Afghanistan has made no commitment to free 5,000 Taliban prisoners. [...] The release of prisoners is not the United States authority, but it is the authority of the government of Afghanistan.\\" Ghani also stated that any prisoner exchange \\"cannot be a prerequisite for talks,\\" but must be a part of the negotiations. On March 2, a Taliban spokesperson stated that they were \\"fully ready\\" for the intra-Afghan talks, but that there would be no talks if about 5,000 of their prisoners are not released. He also said that the agreed-upon period of reduction in violence was over and that operations against Afghan government forces could resume. The Taliban resumed offensive operations against the Afghan army and police on March 3, 2020, conducting attacks in Kunduz and Helmand provinces. On March 4, the US conducted airstrikes on Taliban fighters in Afghanistan's southern Helmand province. The intra-Afghan negotiations did not begin as planned on March 10, 2020. However, on that day Ghani signed a decree ordering the Afghan government to start releasing 1,500 Taliban prisoners on March 14 if they agreed to sign pledges guaranteeing they will not return to battle If they do not sign the pledges, the decree will not go into effect. The same day, the U.S. started withdrawing some troops. Despite the fact that the terms of the peace agreement also received unanimous backing from the UN Security Council, sources close to the Taliban, including Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen, afterward announced that the group had rejected Ghani's prisoner swap decree and still insisted on the release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners. On March 14, 2020, Javid Faisal, a spokesman for the National Security Council, announced that President Ghani had delayed the release of Taliban prisoners, citing a need to review the list of the prisoners, thus endangering the peace agreement between the U.S. government and Taliban. On 27 March 2020, the Afghan government announced the formation of a 21-member negotiation team for the peace talks. However, on 29 March the Taliban rejected the team, stating that \\"we shall only sit for talks with a negotiation team that conforms with our agreements and is constituted in accordance with the laid out principles.\\" On 31 March 2020, a three-person Taliban delegation arrived in Kabul to discuss the release of prisoners. They are the first Taliban representatives to visit Kabul since 2001. The Afghan government had also previously agreed to hold the talks in Bagram Prison. The same day, however, the Afghan government announced that the Taliban's refusal to agree to another ceasefire and the Taliban delegation's refusal to show up at the prison at the scheduled time both resulted in the postponement of the prisoner swap.https://borneobulletin.com.bn/afghan-prisoners-exchange- postponed/ Following the arrival of the Taliban delegation, a senior Afghan government official told Reuters \\"the prisoner release might go ahead in a few days if everything goes as planned.‚Äù On 31 March 2020, the UN Security Council urged for all warring parties to declare a ceasefire in order for the peace process to progress further. On 1 April 2020, it was revealed that the both the Taliban and Afghan government did in fact hold face-to-face talks in Kabul the previous day, unlike the previous video conference talks, and that they were overseen by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). However, Afghanistan's Office of the National Security Council stated that the only progress made so far was \\"on technical matters\\" and Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid afterward stated, \\"There will be no political talks there.\\" Outside the talks, tensions between the Afghan government and Taliban also showed when Afghan authorities blamed the Taliban for a 1 April 2020 explosion which killed several children in Helmand. On the second day of negotiations, it was agreed that on 2 April 2020, up to 100 Taliban prisoners would be released in exchange for 20 Afghan military personnel On 7 April 2020, the Taliban departed from the prisoner swap talks, which Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen described as \\"fruitless.\\" Shaheen also stated in a tweet that hours after walking out of the talks, the Taliban's negotiating team was recalled from Kabul. The Taliban also failed to secure the release of any of the 15 commanders they sought to be released. Arguments over which prisoners to swap also resulted in a delay of the planned prisoner swap. The next day, Faisal maintained that only 100 Taliban prisoners would be released. Faisal later stated that the 100 prisoners, who were incarcerated at Bagram, were released. The Taliban refused to verify these releases, in part due to the fact that the Taliban's withdrawal from Kabul prevented its \\"technical team\\" from making verifications of the prisoner identities. As the Afghan government solely determined which prisoners were released, it also could not be confirmed if any of the prisoners released were on the Taliban's list of preferred names. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meets with the Taliban delegation in Doha, Qatar, on September 12, 2020 On 17 May 2020, Ghani signed a power-sharing deal with his rival Abdullah Abdullah. This deal ended the long-running dispute about the results of the 2019 Afghan presidential elections, and assigned responsibility for peace negotiations to Abdullah. By August 2020, the Afghan government had released 5,100 prisoners, and the Taliban had released 1,000. However, the Afghan government refused to release 400 prisoners from the list of those the Taliban wanted to be released, because those 400 were accused of serious crimes. President Ghani stated that he did not have the constitutional authority to release these prisoners, so he convened a loya jirga from 7 to 9 August to discuss the issue. The jirga agreed to free the 400 remaining prisoners. On 14 August 2020, one of the 21 members of Afghanistan‚Äôs peace negotiating team, Fawzia Koofi was attacked by gunmen, along with her sister Maryam Koofi, near Kabul. Fawzia Koofi is a prominent human rights activist of Afghanistan, who has been vocal in denouncing the Taliban. She was also a part of the team representing the Afghanistan government in the peace talks with the Taliban. Taliban officials have accused the Afghan government of intentionally postponing the release of 100 Taliban detainees in order to hamper intra-Afghan negotiations. To date, the Afghan government has free about 5,000 Taliban prisoners under request from the Trump administration. The Afghan government denies the claims and insists that all Taliban prisoners have been freed. A government mediation team is on standby to travel to Doha for talks with the Taliban but delays have been persistent. Talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban began in Doha on September 12, 2020. The negotiations were set for March but have been delayed over a prisoner exchange dispute. Mawlavi Abdul Hakim will lead negotiations for the Taliban, he is the group's chief justice and a close confidant of Haibatullah Akhundzada. Abdullah Abdullah will be one of the leading figures for the Afghan government negotiating team. The Afghan government team also comprises of women's rights activists.  Surge in insurgent attacks  Despite the peace agreement between the U.S. and the Taliban, insurgent attacks against Afghan security forces were reported to have surged in the country. In the 45 days after the agreement (between 1 March and 15 April 2020), the Taliban conducted more than 4,500 attacks in Afghanistan, which showed an increase of more than 70% as compared to the same period in the previous year. More than 900 Afghan security forces were killed in the period, up from about 520 in the same period a year earlier. Meanwhile, because of a significant reduction in the number of offensives and airstrikes by Afghan and U.S. forces against the Taliban due to the agreement, Taliban casualties dropped to 610 in the period down from about 1,660 in the same period a year earlier. The Pentagon spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, said that although the Taliban stopped conducting attacks against the U.S.-led coalition forces in Afghanistan, the violence was still \\"unacceptably high\\" and \\"not conducive to a diplomatic solution.\\" He added: \\"We have continued to do defensive attacks to help defend our partners in the area and we will continue to do that.\\" On 22 June 2020, Afghanistan reported its \\"bloodiest week in 19 years,\\" during which 291 members of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) were killed and 550 others wounded in 422 attacks carried out by the Taliban. At least 42 civilians, including women and children, were also killed and 105 others wounded by the Taliban across 18 provinces. During the week, the Taliban kidnapped 60 civilians in the central province of Daykundi. On July 1, 2020, the U.S. House Armed Services Committee overwhelmingly voted in favor of a National Defense Authorization Act amendment to restrict President Trump's ability to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Issues Issues which are expected to arise during the negotiations include women's rights; the 2004 Constitution of Afghanistan protects women's freedom of speech and education, which had been suppressed under Taliban rule of Afghanistan. Khalilzad, Ghani, Abdullah, and several other senior Afghan officials have all stated that these rights should be protected, and should not be sacrificed in a peace agreement. The First Lady of Afghanistan, Rula Ghani, has been active in protecting women's rights. Continued violence on both sides remains an obstacle to a final peace agreement. While preliminary talks were going on, the Taliban continued to fight on the battlefield and launch terror attacks in the capital city, and also threatened the 2019 Afghan presidential election on September 28. According to US Air Force statistics released in February 2020, the US dropped more bombs on Afghanistan in 2019 than in any other year since 2013. The US ambassador to Afghanistan warned that a peace agreement could risk the Taliban coming back into power, similar to the aftermath of the 1973 Paris Peace Accords, during which the US-supported South Vietnamese government was defeated in the Fall of Saigon. Pakistan warned that rising tensions in the Gulf region after the killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani could affect the already-delayed US-Afghanistan peace process.

Ancient Greece had a number of different offices in charge of worship of gods and goddesses, and both women and men functioned as priests. While there were local variations depending on cult, the Hiereiai had many similarities across ancient Greece. Appointment There were mainly three methods in which a priestess was appointed: allotment, appointment, or inheritance. Regardless of method, a religious official was normally chosen from among the elite class and aristocracy, as such an office had great prestige. A priestess was counted among the officials of the city, and her office was considered an honor and commemorated with pride by her family. Some sanctuaries honored their priestesses with inscriptions and portrait statues. For this reason, the education necessary for performing was often customarily given to all daughters of aristocratic families with the right position and status for being appointed to the office. Requirements Local variations of cults made different requirements. Normally, goddesses had priestesses and gods priests. The virgin goddess Artemis was, for example, served by young virgins, while Hera, goddess of marriage, was served by adult married women. Tenure In most cults a priestess served only for a limited time. This was especially true of virgin priestesses. Priestesses required to be unmarried virgins during their tenure served for a limited time prior to marriage, often only a year. The priestesses serving the cult of Athena Alea of Tegea, Artemis of Aigeira, Artemis Triklaria of Patrai, Artemis of Ephesus and Poseidon of Kalaureia all served only for a short time between that of reaching adulthood until their wedding. In contrast, the priestess of Heraion of Argos, who was a married woman, served for life. Tasks The priestess was the custodian of the keys to the temple. She was the caretaker of the cult statue of the temple. She officiated at sacred rituals, presided over and lead rituals of worship, and performed ritual sacrifice.

The Jahriyya then tried to violently jailbreak Ma Mingxin which led to his execution and the crushing of the Jahriyya rebels. The Qing used Xinjiang as a place to put deported Jahriyya rebels.

The image is successively split into quadrants based on a homogeneity criterion and similar regions are merged to create the segmented result. The technique incorporates a quadtree data structure, meaning that there is a parent-child node relationship. The total region is a parent, and each of the four splits is a child.  Algorithm  * Define the criterion to be used for homogeneity * Split the image into equal size regions * Calculate homogeneity for each region * If the region is homogeneous, then merge it with neighbors * The process is repeated until all regions pass the homogeneity test  Homogeneity  After each split, a test is necessary to determine whether each new region needs further splitting. The criterion for the test is the homogeneity of the region. There are several ways to define homogeneity, some examples are: * Uniformity- the region is homogeneous if its gray scale levels are constant or within a given threshold. * Local mean vs global mean - if the mean of a region is greater than the mean of the global image, then the region is homogeneous * Variance - the gray level variance is defined as \\\\sigma^2 = (1/(N-1))\\\\sum_{(r,c)\\\\epsilon R}[I(r,c)-\\\\bar{I}] ^2 where r and c are row and column, N is the number of pixels in the region and \\\\bar{I}=(1/N)\\\\sum_{(r,c)\\\\epsilon Region}I(r,c) An example incorporation would be that the variance of a region be less than a specified value in order to be considered homogeneous.

The work depicted a black jazz musician playing the saxophone while a naked white woman dances, as if in a trance. Amid outrage in the British press, the painting was withdrawn from the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1926 after one week at the request of the British Colonial Office as the subject matter \\"was considered to be obnoxious to British subjects living abroad in daily contact with a coloured population\\". The painting was then destroyed by its author and his wife, but Souter preserved his preparatory drawings and made a reconstructed version in 1962, one decade before his death. The painting has been described as embodying the fears of Western civilization towards jazz music.  Description and themes  In Souter's painting, a negro jazz musician is in full white tie evening dress with a top hat; he sits on a cast down and shattered classical statue of Minerva, the goddess of virginity and traditional values. Nearby, an androgynous female dancer ‚Äî a flapper with short bobbed hair ‚Äî has her eyes are closed, as if she is in a trance. Her hastily discarded lingerie and green leather shoes are scattered on the ground, with just one green earring visible. A flesh-colored stocking lies draped over the statue's broken arm. The musician's race and instrument signifies that he is playing jazz music. He is black and the woman is white, playing on contemporaneous concerns about the popularity of (predominantly black) jazz music to the (predominantly white) British public, and the perceived threat posed by hypersexualised and exoticised black men to white women, in the wake of thousands of brown babies born to British women following World War I. However, according to critic Karl Toepfer, \\"the musician gazes not at the woman but out toward the spectator, and the implication is that jazz and dance together allow man and woman to cross racial barriers and form a new and mysteriously intimate (or trusting) sort of couple, each immersed in separate aspirations.\\" Souter's stated intention was to \\"illustrate the tendency nowadays for Jazz's influence to permeate our daily lives\\", and to \\"suggest the fascination exercised by the primitive and savage upon the over-civilised\\". The title of his painting was a twin reference to both \\"a musical breakdown,\\" in which a jazz musician has the freedom to express their own improvised statement, and \\"a societal breakdown\\" in which women in British society could express a similar freedom now that gender roles had been redefined.  Reception  = Popular enthusiasm = The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition starting on 3 May 1926, the day before the start of the 1926 General Strike. The painting was viewed by King George V, British statesman Ramsay MacDonald, the Countess Baldwin of Bewdley, Lady Cynthia Asquith, Dame Lloyd George, and other notable personages. Initially, Frank Dicksee, the President of the Royal Academy, praised Souter's piece as \\"a work of great promise by executed with a considerable degree of excellence\\". According to Catherine Tackley, professor of music at the University of Liverpool, \\"the reaction to the painting epitomise[d] the response to this new jazz music\\" with \\"huge popular enthusiasm\\" mixed with \\"an undercurrent of suspicion that this was a dangerous new art form subverting decent society.\\" Ultimately, at the request of the Colonial Office which deemed the painting to be a threat to the interests of the British empire, the painting was removed after merely five days and replaced by an uncontroversial portrait of Lady Diana Manners by James Jebusa Shannon. Despite its removal, word of Souter's painting had already spread, and crowds of excited visitors thronged to the exhibition only to search the walls in vain for the sequestered work. Explanations by the exhibition's attendants did little to convince disappointed audiences that it had been withdrawn upon \\"the request of the Colonial Office who disapproved, from the Colonial standpoint, of the subject‚Äîa negro playing jazz for a nude white dancer.\\" The only remaining evidence that the painting had been exhibited was a photograph of the work displayed in the front hall. = Press condemnation = The work was widely condemned in British newspapers and periodicals and its exhibition quickly became controversial. In an early edition of the Melody Maker, a British weekly music magazine, London-born critic Edgar Jackson demanded the painting be encindered: The world press likewise fixated upon the painting. In the United States of America, a journalist for The New York Times assailed the work as \\"this year's problem picture.\\" After conceding that \\"as a protest against the jazz age, the picture seems undoubtedly effective,\\" the Times journalist nevertheless opined that the work would excite needless controversy and should not have been exhibited. Similarly, Boston Evening Transcript criticised the work under the headline \\"A Racial Outrage\\" and claimed the painting was designed \\"to horrify decent people\\". Likewise, in South Africa, the Cape Argus deemed the work to be a \\"problem picture ... Negro Supersedes Minerva\\".  Destruction  Following outrage by the press and the painting's withdrawal from exhibition, Souter and his wife Christian Grace Reid destroyed his original 1926 painting, but Souter kept his preparatory drawings. For decades the work was only known from a photograph published in the exhibition catalogue but, towards the end of his life, Souter made a second version in the 1960s. A charcoal study was acquired by the Aberdeen Art Gallery in 2016, with funding from the Scottish National Fund for Acquisitions. Legacy and influence English writer Evelyn Waugh attended the exhibition in its first week. The controversy over the painting may have inspired him to include a mixed-race relationship between his fictional characters of the white Margot and black Chokey in his 1928 novel Decline and Fall. According to Gemma Romain, a historian and researcher focusing on black history in Britain, Souter's now-destroyed Jazz Age work retains considerable legacy as a landmark in British culture:  References   Bibliography           External links  * John Bulloch Souter's The Breakdown (Lyon & Turnbull) Category:1926 paintings Category:1962 paintings Category:Works about jazz Category:Musical instruments in art Category:Black people in art Category:Women in art Category:Nude art Category:Erotic art Category:Black British history ","title":"The Breakdown"},{"id":"57214589","text":"Pinkerton Park is a 34-acre municipal park located in Franklin, Tennessee, United States at 405 Murfreesboro Road, east of the Harpeth River, near downtown Franklin.

He had edited and co-edited a number of magazines, and contributed columns on art and literature to the national Urdu language newspaper Daily Jang. Education and early life Shafi Aqeel was born in 1930, close to Saddar Bazaar, Lahore. Aqeel did not have formal education, learning to read the Quran at mosque. About his early life, he said, \\"Poverty is nothing to abhor or be ashamed of. Rather, it may work as a stimulus. I think if I hadn't been poor, I wouldn't have achieved what I have.\\" Aqeel served in the National Guard of Pakistan. While working for the guards, Aqeel was witness to extreme scenes of poverty including the spread of cholera amongst migrants. Aqeel received no pay and even had to bring food from home. In later years, he completed the Munshi-Fazil and Adeeb-Fazil exams. Writing career His first article appeared in the Zamindar newspaper in 1947, and he changed his name from Mohammad Shafi to Shafi Aqeel. It was the result of his outpouring on the then raging issue of Ilm-ud-din (Shaheed). He did not have a traditional teacher for poetry, which he initiated in 1948 but began composing in earnest in 1957. \\"I think anybody with 'mauzoon tabiyat' ‚Äî a particular bent of mind for poetry ‚Äì can judge for himself whether the metre and rhyme of his lines is correct\\" he said.

He edited and co-edited a number of magazines, and contributed columns on art and literature to the national Urdu-language newspaper Daily Jang. Aqeel wrote 30 books in Urdu and Punjabi, two of which were collections of his poetry written in Punjabi.

Settlements Due to the remoteness of the loch, there are very few settlements in the area. The main A832 road that is part of the Wester Ross Coastal Trail, leaves the main A835 road, at the Falls of Measach and passes the eastern end of the loch. Walking Loch a' Bhraoin is an considered an excellent location for walkers.There are essentially four routes into the mountains surroundig the Loch a' Bhraoin.

On a north by northeast direction from a' Chailleach, the mountains have been folded extensively. Two corries overlook Loch a' Bhraoin to the north. The first of these is formed by the mountain Toman C√≤innich at 935 metres, forms the corrie that contains Loch Toll an Lochain, where the direction of the corrie faces the northern end of the loch, similar to a giants seat. Further east again, is Sgurr Breac, which forms the peak of the second fold, which creates the corrie, that is intersected by a long shallow valley that descends from 600metres down to the north-east end of the loch. On the northern end of the loch, there is several small hills, that make a shallow cliff that follows the curve of the loch. Overlooking the southwest end of the loch, is Creag Rainich at 807 metres and Meall Dubh at 748metres comprising two hills.

The school's mission is to teach \\"deaf and hearing children to listen, talk, learn, and achieve excellence together\\". Tucker Maxon is a 501c(3) non-profit corporation governed by a 14-member Board of Directors and managed by a 30+ member staff and faculty. History Tucker Maxon School was founded in 1947 by Stoel Rives attorney Paul Boley, a pioneer in oral education and related technology, and five Portland families who dreamed of providing their deaf children with the gift of speech. Boley‚Äôs daughter Barbara Ann contracted meningitis and lost her hearing at the age of 18 months. Initially, the Boleys enrolled their daughter in the preschool program at Portland‚Äôs Hosford Public School for Deaf Children. At Hosford, he was introduced to instructor Alice Maxon, who believed \\"Deaf children can talk‚Äù.Unknown author. \\"Profile of Alice Maxon - Hear Say\\", The Portland Center for Hearing & Speech May‚ÄìJune 1963. Boley toured oral schools in the Midwest and on the East Coast, and was particularly impressed with the Wright School, Helen Keller‚Äôs Alma mater. At the suggestion of the president of the Wright School, Boley began to dream of opening a small school in Portland where his daughter and other deaf children could learn to speak. .Morrison, Wilma. \\"Parents of Deaf children Strive for Model Oral School\\", The Oregonian, July 25, 1948. At Boley‚Äôs request, the president of Cascades Plywood Corporation, Max Tucker, sponsored the school during its earliest years, and made sizable donations which allowed Tucker Maxon to build and open its first school building in 1953.Unknown author. \\"Lumberman's Bequest New Hope for Deaf\\", Salem Statesman Journal, February 9, 1950. The building was designed by architect Pietro Belluschi. In 1963, Tucker Maxon opened their second building with classrooms, offices, and a gymnasium. In 2014, the school began Tucker Arts Camp that focuses on art, music, dance, sculpture, film, photography and the culinary arts each summer. The camp focuses on a different country or continent each week for 8 weeks. In 2015, 2017 and 2018, Tucker Maxon was named one of the Top 100 Nonprofits in Oregon Educational Approach Tucker Maxon is one of approximately 40 schools that teach children who are deaf to speak. Tucker Maxon began co-enrolling students who were not deaf or hard of hearing in the mid-1980s, when it leased space to a neighborhood preschool. Tucker Maxon formally adopted co-enrollment in 2002, when it extended enrollment to include students with typical hearing, and became one of the first schools in the country to co-enroll students with hearing loss and those with typical hearing. At Tucker Maxon students with hearing loss do not use sign language, even though sign language acquisition has been proven to be critical for the cognitive and psychosocial functioning of deaf childrenhttps://ssa.uchicago.edu/ssa_magazine/sign-language-best-deaf- children; instead, they use assistive technologies such as cochlear implants with FM transmitters and hearing aids, under the guidance of trained professionals, and they listen, talk, play, and learn alongside their hearing peers. Tucker Maxon offers classrooms with an average student to teacher ratio of 8:1 to allow for individual attention that ensures each child is developing appropriate language and academic skills. Students become comfortable using technology with interactive digital whiteboards and Chromebook laptop computers. In 2013, Tucker Maxon was evaluated by OPTION Schools Inc. and exceeded the organization‚Äôs standards for Listening and Spoken Language schools. Programs and Services Tucker Maxon is the only Listening and Spoken Language school in Oregon. Tucker Maxon offers: * Highly qualified teaching staff ‚Äî almost all have master's degrees * Specialized instruction for children who are deaf or hard of hearing, birth through 5th grade * Direct Early Intervention services for infants and toddlers (birth to 3) who are deaf or hard of hearing with their families * Instruction for children with typical hearing, preschool through 5th grade * Sound-field speaker systems to help students access the teacher's verbal instructions * On-site speech therapy and audiology services * Small class sizes with individual attention * Physical Education five days per week * Weekly art and music classes * Outdoor play where children creatively explore the playground equipment and natural resources * Extended Care Programs offering before and after school care * A focus on social and emotional intelligence * Opportunities for children to value differences and help one another Campus Tucker Maxon School is located on SE Holgate Blvd, in the Reed neighborhood of inner Southeast Portland.

Personal life 't Hoen was the son of the Utrecht grocer and cheese merchant Reinier 't Hoen, and Johanna Masman. He started his studies at the elite Hi√´ronymusschool (a Latin school in Utrecht) in 1755, but was so unruly that his father had him put in a borstal, called De Vurige Kolom (The Fiery Column) for a year on 29 December 1761, but he was allowed to leave after less than a year in November 1762. Soon hereafter, in April 1763, he married the then 17-year-old Annemietje Nihof, daughter of a Leiden textile merchant. They would remain married for almost 63 years, and have four sons and four daughters between 1764 and 1781. The couple moved in with his parents at the Neude in Utrecht, and he probably worked in his father's business until 1777. Career To compensate for his spoiled scholastic career 't Hoen indulged in self-study in his spare time and tried to gain entry to the literary circles of his time, which was difficult for someone without scholastic credentials. He therefore made an attempt to draw the attention of the Leiden poet Johannes le Francq van Berkheij by writing an Ode dedicated to this person in October 1774. The poet indeed took him under his wings and introduced him in polite society. Together with twelve other amateurs 't Hoen started the Utrecht society for poetry Volmaakter door den tijd (More perfect through time). In the next few years he became a successful writer of poetry (especially verse for children't Hoen is seen by literary critics as an epigone of Hieronymus van Alphen, and not a very good one;Cf. Ros, pp. 1-3) and plays. As he received a sinecure in the form of the stewardship of the Collegium Willebrordi, a boarding school associated with the Hi√´ronymusschool, in March 1777, he had more time to dedicate himself to his literary work.One of the perks of the job was the use of an apartment in the building of the College. The office also gave him an entry in the world of the Utrecht regenten and Utrecht politics. Between 1778 and 1780 he wrote a number of moralizing and political essays under the pseudonym J.A. Schasz, M.D.According to Theeuwen this pseudonym would later be appropriated by the Patriot journalist Gerrit Paape. However, Ros claims that the pseudonym was always Paape's and the early plays with the pseudonym were also written by Paape. Cf. Ros, p. 2 He also wrote four political comedies, inspired by the American Revolution and the American Revolutionary War, with an anti-British tenor, under this pseudonym. These plays were popular under the pro-American citizenry of the Dutch Republic at this time. Those sympathies were not shared by the regime of stadtholder William V, Prince of Orange who was related to the British king George III of the United KingdomHe was a grandson of king George II of Great Britain, just like George III himself, through his mother, Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange. and therefore preferred a pro- British and anti-American/French policy. Despite this official policy of the Republic, Great Britain was so displeased with a number of pro-American Dutch policies that it declared war on the Republic in December 1780. This war did not go well for the Dutch, and the population blamed the stadtholder. 't Hoen, sharing this feeling, started a publication, entitled De Post van den Neder- Rhijn, on 20 January 1781, which in the following six years would become a thorn in the side of the stadtholder's regime.One of the scoops of De Post was the publication of the secret Acte van Consulentschap in 1784 De Post was published by the printer's firm G.T. van Paddenburg & Zoon in Utrecht (who used his own name). Most of the contributors to the journal (that was published weekly in a format of 8 Octavo pages, and cost 1 1/2 stuiver) used pseudonyms, however, because of the risk of prosecution for \\"sedition\\". The weekly soon enjoyed a wide circulation (2400 copies per issue) in the entire Netherlands, probably because of its moderate and reasoned presentation of radical points of view.It was less of a scandal sheet than its competition, such as the Politieke Kruyer from Amsterdam. It became one of the leading Patriot journals in Utrecht, with great political influence. In November 1782 't Hoen became a member of the Patriot club Getrouw voor het Vaderland (Loyal to the Fatherland), a leading Utrecht political society, together with Pro Patria et Libertate in which the other Patriot leader in Utrecht Quint Ondaatje was a member. He also in November 1785 took up a commission as a lieutenant in the Utrecht schutterij in the Turkije company. As such he got engaged in the exercitiegenootschap-movement that was important in Patriot politics. De Post published a large number of articles about this movement in this period. It became one of the major organs of Patriot propaganda in this way. Both as journalist and political activist 't Hoen became involved in the democratization process of the Utrecht city and provincial government in 1784-1785, which led to the first democratically elected city government in the Dutch Republic in August 1786. The adherents of the stadtholder, the Orangists formed a rival States of Utrecht in December 1785 that moved to Amersfoort under the protection of a garrison of Dutch States Army troops that repeatedly threatened Utrecht. On 9 May 1787 't Hoen, with his company of schutters took part in the Battle of Jutphaas to repel one of those threatening moves. This success was, however, soon followed by the Prussian invasion of Holland, during which Utrecht was given up to the Prussians without a fight. 't Hoen followed the Patriot troops in their retreat to Amsterdam in September 1787. After the fall of Amsterdam on 10 October, 't Hoen fled like many other Patriots to first Brussels, and later northern France with his family. In 1789 he was sentenced in absentia to 25 years banishment.Ros, p. 1 In France he received a pension of 2,400 livres from the French government in recognition of his work as a journalist, who had often been supportive of French policies. He lived for short periods of time in Saint-Omer, Gravelines, Dunkirk, and eventually Watten near St. Omer, where he joined a \\"commune\\" of other Dutch Patriots, like his colleagues Wybo Fijnje and Gerrit Paape. In this period he remained active as a journalist. He started a new publication, entitled Gedenkschriften van Martinus Scriblerus den Jongen (Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus the Younger) that had an anti- clerical character. He also cooperated with the journalist Joost Vrijdag in editing the periodical Duinkerksche historische courant (Dunkirk historical journal), but this went bankrupt, according to Vrijdag because of 't Hoen's financial incompetence. When the new French government ended his pension in 1793 't Hoen started a tobacco factory, and sold his real estate in Utrecht. He was sufficiently successful as a writer that he could live from his writings. In 1793 he published Kort historisch verhaal en onzydige aanmerkingen over de gesteltenis van Braband (Short historical narrative and neutral remarks about the situation of Braband) by Jan Frans Vonck. Meanwhile, 't Hoen became embroiled in the internal strife of the exiled Patriots between the followers of Johan Valckenaer and Court Lambertus van Beyma on the side of Valckenaer. Together with the latter and several other Dutchmen he became active in French revolutionary politics as a member of the Jacobin party in Watten, though he kept apart from the turmoil of the Reign of Terror of Maximilien Robespierre c.s. He followed the French army that in November 1794 and early 1795 overran the Dutch Republic, and helped found the Batavian Republic as the secretary of the Provisional Representatives of the People of Utrecht (the Utrecht equivalent of the Provisional Representatives of the People of Holland) in February 1795. This was made permanent when on 17 March 1795 he was made secretary of the Finance Committee. On 18 April 1796 he was appointed secretary of the new provincial government of Utrecht. Meanwhile, he also founded a new journal, De Nieuwe Post van den Neder-Rhijn. This weekly would have 260 issues with a circulation of 1,400 copies between 10 March 1795 and 6 December 1799. In this new journal he published a draft for a new constitution for the Batavian Republic that had a decided '\\"unitarist\\" slant in that it proposed the abolition of the federal structure of the Republic. This was an important issue in those days. The strife between the \\"federalists\\" and \\"unitarists\\" would in January 1798 issue into a coup d'etat that brought the '\\"unitarists\\" in power. 't Hoen supported this overturn of the political order, and he was as a result confirmed in his post as secretary of the new regional government that in 1799 replaced the old provinces of Utrecht and Gelderland with a Department that encompassed both. In this same period 't Hoen promoted religious emancipation of dissenters and Roman Catholics, who under the old Republic had been discriminated against in favor of members of the Dutch Reformed Church in De Nieuwe Post. In the Summer of 1799 't Hoen, as secretary of the departmental government, got very busy with defensive measures against a threatening invasion by Orangist √âmigr√©s from Germany, in support of the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland. For that reason he was forced to neglect his work for De Nieuwe Post and this caused the cessation of its publication in December 1799. The coup d'etat of October 1801 brought a far more conservative regime in the Batavian Republic to power, which attracted many former Orangists. 't Hoen lost his post as secretary and was demoted to Commies (clerk), with a large diminution of salary in 1802. 't Hoen lost his political influence and returned to private life. He started writing plays again, but ceased his literary work in 1806. In 1811 (after the annexation of the Netherlands by the First French Empire) 't Hoen managed to obtain a post as clerk of the court in Amersfoort. He and his wife lived in a comfortable home in this city until their deaths (his wife died in 1826). His last years were difficult because of financial troubles, and because six of his children predeceased him. He himself died on 9 January 1828, 83 years old.

Early life Appleton was born in Chelmsford, Essex. He served in the Royal Navy during the Suez Crisis and the Korean War upon HMS Implacable, and first met Queen Elizabeth II as a 17-year-old seaman during a royal inspection of the ship. After leaving the navy, Appleton dredged diamonds in Southern Africa and later owned a carpet shop. Appleton also owns a care home in his hometown. Career as a crier Appleton later trained as a toastmaster and has opened events in Milan, Amsterdam, and Las Vegas. Appleton recalls being told by a young child at a fete opening that \\"he looked like a town crier\\", and having \\"never looked back\\" since then. In the early 2000s, Appleton became the official town crier of Romford in East London. Appleton cites himself as the President of the Guild of International Millennium Town Criers on his website. Appleton later had unofficial crier duties at the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the 2012 Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, and the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. Despite having no formal royal role, Appleton is most famous for his unofficial announcements of royal births and other events. Appleton gained international fame in 2013 by announcing the birth of Prince George of Cambridge from the steps of the Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London. Appleton, who describes himself as a royalist, stated that he arrived at the hospital unannounced and did not expect to be allowed onto the steps of the hospital to announce the birth. Appleton‚Äôs decision to turn up uninvited was misconstrued by American journalists Anderson Cooper and Rachel Maddow, who describes him as a royal crier when they aired his announcements on their shows. When it became clear Appleton had no formal status and was simply acting as a private citizen, Maddow issued a correction. In May 2015, Appleton announced the birth of Princess Charlotte, Prince George's sister, from the same place as he had announced Prince George's birth. In an interview with Us Weekly, Appleton stated that in contrast to his earlier announcement, the royal entourage was expecting his attendance outside the hospital. Later in that year, Appleton announced from the gates of Buckingham Palace that Elizabeth II had surpassed her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria as the longest-reigning monarch of Britain. In November 2017, Appleton ‚Äì again in an unofficial capacity ‚Äì announced the engagement of Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle from the gates of Kensington Palace in London. Appleton returned to public attention in April 2018, when he announced the birth of Prince Louis of Cambridge from the steps of St Mary's Hospital. Appleton's announcement was once again assumed official by American news outlets, with CBS Morning News, who broadcast the announcement live, describing Appleton's announcement as \\"official\\" on the air and over the official CBS News Twitter account. The Independent journalist Jon Stone compared Appleton's unofficial role to the presence of bishops in the House of Lords and the inability of Members of Parliaments to officially resign their seats in the House of Commons, whereas Huffington Post UK journalist Jess Brammar compared Appleton to the role of Black Rod and the corresponding spectacle relating to Black Rod's invitation to MPs to the annual Speech from the Throne. Autobiography In 2016, Appleton self published Now or Never, an autobiographical account of his time spent in the orbit of celebrities.

Calhoun's portrait, done by Washington Bogart Cooper, was given to the Odd Fellows' Grand Lodge in 1896. His daughter Mary bequeathed her estate to Vanderbilt University for the construction of Calhoun Hall in 1918.

The Bedford Introduction to Literature. 11th ed., Bedford/St. Martin‚Äôs, 2016.Shivani, Anis. \\"How Good Was American Social Poetry of the Forties?.\\" Antigonish Review, no. 157, 2009, p. 73. It is written in the form of a job advertisement. In it, Fearing satirizes the autonomy of killing in the European theatre of World War II. He uses verbal irony to mock how ‚Äúcasually and mindlessly people are prepared to accept the horrors of war‚Äù. Synopsis and structure The poem, being in the form of a job description, attempts to recruit men into a ‚Äúnew, tremendous‚Äù.Fearing, Kenneth. ‚ÄúAD.‚Äù The Bedford Introduction to Literature. 11th ed., Ed. Michael Meyer, Bedford/St. Martin‚Äôs, 2016, p. 717. field. Fearing then asks the reader if they have experienced a series of detailed gruesome acts, such as having ‚Äúheavenly visions of people, by the thousands, dying in flames‚Äù. This digression of imagery is broken off by an invitation to apply for the position. The subject is dehumanized further by requiring a new race of men to fight who possess no skill, ambition, intelligence, or character. The poem closes with a final promotion and stating ‚ÄúWages: Death‚Äù The job advertisement structuring of the poem lends itself to a further emotional detachment from the act of killing. The speakerless listing of ‚ÄúAD,‚Äù such as in lines 9 and 10, ‚ÄúWanted: A race of brand-new men. / Apply: Middle Europe‚Äù. This trait conveys that there are simply roles to fill in order to achieve the objective of mass murder. While being a soldier is a respectable profession, it does not necessarily have to come with the same apathy to tragedy that is displayed in the poem. Using a break from italics and an ending em dash, lines 4-6 act as an aside from the rest of the work. The lines preceding and following this remain in the rigid listing format of an advertisement, while the aside itself escapes the bulleted staccato rhythm by detailing several barbaric deeds that a person interested in the ad might have done. This section abruptly segues back into the primary pattern as if to snap the reader‚Äôs attention back to the purpose of the ad. The sudden transition is exaggerated by the em dash ending the aside: ‚ÄúIf you thrill at the thought of throwing poison into wells, have heavenly visions of people, by the thousands, dying in flames‚Äî / You are the very man we want‚Äù. In this, the poem emphasizes a description of the repulsive kind of person who would enjoy war, contrasting it with the dryness and emotional dissociation of an advertisement. Context and purpose Although World War II was Fearing‚Äôs primary motivation to write ‚ÄúAD,‚Äù it was not the only incentive. Fearing was an avid proletarian writer and was heavily influenced by communist ideologies. His poetry regularly described ‚Äúthe feelings of a normally mute and ignored underclass‚Äù.Lewis, Leon. \\"Kenneth Fearing.\\" Critical Survey of Mystery & Detective Fiction, Revised Edition, January 2008, pp. 1-5. He also wrote in common language which anyone can understand. Therefore, Fearing saw a world war as poor men fighting a rich man‚Äôs battle and used his poetry to convince the working class to reject the political and social concepts surrounding the war. In ‚ÄúAD‚Äù he uses understatement to emphasize the atrocities of a war that should not concern those fighting it. By characterizing someone who would enjoy war as psychopathic, he repels the reader from warfare. The primary purpose is to draw attention to the insanities of war and to disrupt nations‚Äô hailing of soldiers. Analysis Fearing utilizes language, structure, imagery, and overall tone to completely dehumanize the act of killing another human. His candid language in ‚ÄúAD‚Äù not only reaches out to a wider audience, but also dramatizes the inhumanity in WWII. The first line of the poem, ‚ÄúWanted: Men,‚Äù may as well say ‚ÄúWanted: Bodies‚Äù. Personalities and ambitions are not wanted in soldiers, as Fearing explains. The advertisement only calls for brainless men to pull triggers, with no extra intuition. The reader is simply characterized as a part of the business of war as well as of a new race of men. The rapidity of the disconnected statements in the poem also lends itself to brutal nature of the Second World War. Each line is essentially a bulleted point, providing little sense of stability or linearity. The primary element each line shares is the goal to dehumanize the human puppets of war. This separation of statements also contributes to a further dissociation of empathy and emotional desensitization to the subject matter. Men that thrive in war are described by Fearing as ‚Äúfigure[s] in a chamber of horrors‚Äù and psychiatric ward escapees. He continues, indicating that they are a new race of men who are wanted in Middle Europe. This incites imagery in the reader of a fantastical subhuman race akin to the orcs in Tolkien‚Äôs Lord of the Rings. Fearing uses this implicit comparison to further barbarize war. Finally, the reader is informed of what they will gain if they choose to accept the much demanded job. The only thing an applicant gains in this position is a wage of death. Fearing implies that they are worthless if they are not alive and fighting; otherwise, they may as well be dead. When they are paid their wage of death, another man is simply needed to fill their place.

The show was hosted by former Fleetwood Mac singer-songwriter-guitarist Bob Welch and was produced by Lawrence Smith. Later episodes were hosted by Mackenzie Phillips. The show's theme was written and recorded by Carmine Appice, who included a reworked version on his eponymous album the following year. Taking advantage of music videos being produced more commonly by record labels to promote their records, the show was a precursor to MTV, which launched the following year. Beyond the record label-produced music videos, original music videos focusing on the hot acts from the Los Angeles club scene were produced exclusively for the show. Musicians making some of their first televised appearances included Berlin, The Plimsouls, Toni Basil, Shandi, Paul Warren & Explorer, Gary Myrick and the Figures, Surf Punks, 20/20 and The GoGos. Welch would do the wraparound content, frequently from the back of a convertible driving around the Sunset Strip and similar club areas at night. He would also conduct interviews with celebrities such as Stewart Copeland, Madame Wong, Dave Hlubek, John Densmore and Joan Jett.

His collection's debut was an art installation at Universal Studios instead of a traditional fashion show. The installation involved art scenes depicting a car accident, an altar to Our Lady of Guadalupe, and footage of Fox News and U.S. President Donald Trump underneath a neon sign spelling out Hell. His 2016 Autumn/Winter line was featured in Vogue. Getty's Spring 2018 collection made its debut at the Four Seasons Hotel in Milan.

She was a reporter for the Daily Province in Vancouver from 1910 to 1919, which took her to Europe to cover the war and the subsequent peace treaty. Early life and family Nasmyth was born to Deborah (nee Dignam) and James Nasmyth on August 12, 1885 in Stratford, Ontario. Her father was a pharmacist. She was the third child born out of five and the only daughter. Her aunt was Mary Dignam, a painter and the first president of Women's Art Association of Canada. Dignam influenced Nasmyth in her suffragette and feminist views. Nasmyth graduated from Woodstock Collegiate Institute and then attended finishing school at Alma College in St. Thomas, Ontario. After graduation, she studied at the University of Toronto before leaving in 1907. Her first journalist job was at the Woodstock Sentinel- Review. After a few years, she moved to Vancouver, British Columbia where one of her brothers was living.

She also joined the Vancouver Province also known as the Daily Province. Nasmyth was a charter member of the Vancouver branch of the Canadian Women's Press Club. Her activity with the club made her close friends with poet and writer Pauline Johnson. In 1914, Nasmyth took part in the Komagata Maru incident where she spent time watching the ship, preventing the Indian immigrants from coming ashore.  First World War  The Province sent Nasmyth to London to cover the war in 1914, arriving before the end of 1914. She was known for trying to evade press censorship by smuggling her articles past the censors. She would provide articles to her brother, a businessman who often traveled to England. He would smuggle the reports back to Canada. Nasymth covered the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. One of the Canadian delegates to the conference was Arthur Sifton, who was her second cousin. Political activism  In 1917, Nasmyth was the campaign manager for Roberta MacAdams, a military dietitian who ran for the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, who became the second woman ever elected to the Assembly. Later life  Nasmyth married Mackenzie Furniss in 1918. The couple arrived back in Canada in 1920, settling in Montreal. In 1921, they had a son named Henry, and then in 1924, they had a daughter named Monica. Nasmyth started writing fiction for the British magazine Modern Woman and the Canadian magazine Chatelaine. Nasmyth died in Vancouver, British Columbia, on October 23, 1977.

It stars Elisabeth Moss, Cara Delevingne, Dan Stevens, Agyness Deyn, Gayle Rankin, Ashley Benson, Dylan Gelula, Virginia Madsen and Amber Heard and follows Moss as fictional rock star Becky Something, whose band experiences brief fame but is broken up by her self-destructive behavior. The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2018, and had its general release on April 12, 2019, by . The film has received positive reviews from critics. Plot The film is told with five distinct scenes punctuated with some home movie footage from early in the band's career when they were successful‚Äîappearing on magazine covers, attending photo shoots, and receiving gold records. In the first scene, punk rock group Something She wraps up a show and lead vocalist Becky Something (Elisabeth Moss) goes backstage to attend to a brief ceremony with her personal shaman. Her mood swings violently from happy to aggressive as her bandmates, ex-husband, manager, and a former musical collaborator all try to steer her toward positive choices: recording their next album, playing future shows, and finding stability for her child. The scene ends as she turns a corner with her infant in her hands and falls over inebriated, puking on herself. In the second vignette, Something She is in the studio several months later, aimlessly trying to record the band's next album. Drummer Ali van der Wolff (Gayle Rankin) becomes frustrated and quits, followed by bassist Marielle Hell (Agyness Deyn), leaving their manager Howard Goodman (Eric Stoltz) distraught as he tries to clear the space for his new band Akergirls to record. Becky refuses to leave and butts in on their session. The third scene is set after Akergirls have become famous and Becky is opening their show, with Ali back to support her. She shows up two hours late with a film crew in tow, berating ex-husband Danny (Dan Stevens) and her mother Ania (Virginia Madsen), who are the last persons in her life still willing to put up with her selfishness. When Ania gives her some papers from her estranged father, Becky becomes violently upset and hurls verbal abuse at her mother and assaults Ali before rushing onstage and collapsing in another stupor. Several years later, Becky is sober and her daughter Tama (Daisy Pugh-Weiss), now a young girl, is coming to visit. As Dan drops her off, he gives his ex some paperwork for some of the many lawsuits facing Becky and tells her that Mari has also come with them. Becky has brief tender moments with all three, but her thinking appears disordered: she believes that leaving her house will kill her and that her love for her daughter will destroy her; she also recounts a dream from a past life that she thinks justifies her cruelty and selfishness toward her ex. In the final piece, 11 years have passed since Howard first signed Something She and four years since they have performed together, but they have reunited to perform a single song at a showcase event that features all of Howard's popular musical acts. Becky appears nervous and has to rely on all of the musicians performing a seance with her before she can gather her courage to go onstage. She briefly walks away after cryptically thanking all of them for staying with her until the end. Several of her loved ones become concerned, but they find her ready to take the stage and she performs one song with her bandmates and fellow musicians all collaborating. It is successful and they step backstage where Howard tells her the crowd wants more and asks if she has another one in her. Becky says that she is done, embracing Tama and smelling her hair. Cast Production In January 2018, it was announced Elisabeth Moss would star in the film, with Alex Ross Perry directing from a screenplay he wrote. Perry and Moss also served as a producers on the film, alongside Matthew Perniciaro, Michael Sherman and Adam Piotrowicz under their Bow and Arrow Entertainment banner. In April 2018, Agyness Deyn, Gayle Rankin and Amber Heard joined the cast of the film. In May 2018, it was announced that Ashley Benson, Cara Delevingne, Dan Stevens, Eric Stoltz, Virginia Madsen and Dylan Gelula joined the cast of the film. Keegan DeWitt composed the film's score. Principal photography began on April 23, 2018, in New York City. Production concluded on May 18, 2018. Moss called the performance her most physically challenging in a 2020 interview for Bullseye with Jesse Thorn. Release The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2018. It also screened at the New York Film Festival on September 29, 2018. Shortly after, Gunpowder & Sky acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film. It also screened at AFI Fest on November 10, 2018. and was screened at South by Southwest in March 2019. It was released on April 12, 2019. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 125 reviews, and an average rating of 7.39/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"Held together by a gripping lead performance from Elisabeth Moss, Her Smell is challenging and admittedly uneven, but ultimately worth the effort.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 69 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". A. A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film a B+, praising Moss' performance in particular and the film's attempt to de-glamorize the rock and roll lifestyle. The publication later placed it fifty-fifth in their 100 best films of the decade and sixth-best of 2019. On 27 November 2019, Perry wrote an open letter that premiered on IndieWire urging the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to consider Moss for the Academy Award for Best Actress at their 2020 ceremony. Soundtrack The film's original rock music was written by Bully's Alicia Bognanno with the score composed by Keegan DeWitt.

They are colored dark brown and often covered with bits of soil. The thorax has three \\"teeth\\" on each lateral edge, after which the species is named (denticollis is Latin for \\"toothed-collar\\"). The beetles drop from their food plants to the ground and hide when they are disturbed, making them difficult to find. Southern corn leaf beetles overwinter as adults beneath the soil and plant debris and in clumps of some species of weeds. The adults emerge again in early spring, to feed on young weed hosts such as cocklebur, smartweed, and crabgrass as well as early- planted corn.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù.Virginia's Mountain Treasures, report issued by The Wilderness Society, May, 1999 At 2202 acres, the area is almost as large as the adjacent Little Dry Run Wilderness, one of the most lightly used wilderness areas in the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area. The area is part of the Mount Rogers Cluster. Location and access LittleDryRunVA Wytheville 188819 1982 100000Scaled geoAreaThe area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia about 8 miles west of Cripple Creek, Virginia, between Blue Springs Rd (Va 672) on the south, Dry Rd. (Va 612) on the north, Grayson Turnpike (US 21) on the west and Hale Lake Rd. (VA 798) on the east. It is on the south side of Little Dry Run Wilderness. Trails and roads into the area include: *Route 337,open seasonally *The Iron Mountain Trail, adjacent to the area *Little Dry Run Trail, 4.13 miles *Virginia Highlands Horse Trail, FS 337, 82 miles *Iron Mountain Trail, FS 301, 44.3 miles Motorcycles are allowed on part of the Virginia Highlands Horse Trail from October 1 through April 1. The boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Map 786. A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land‚Äôs coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable., Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Little Dry Run Wilderness Addition is covered by USGS topographic maps Speedwell and Cedar Springs. Natural history The forest is composed mostly of broadleaf deciduous species with some yellow pine. About 1/3 of the area, with colluvial drainages, toeslopes and stream floodplains, has a rich habitat that supports yellow poplar, northern red oak, white oak, basswood, cucumber tree, white ash, eastern hemlock, and red maple. The remainder of the area, on the north and west slopes, contains white oak, northern red oak and hickory, and ridgetops and eastern slopes contain chestnut oak, scarlet oak and yellow pine. There are 77 acres of table mountain pine, one of Virginia‚Äôs few remaining stands of pure table mountain pine. In addition there are mixed forests of table mountain pine and hardwoods. The proportion of table mountain pine and pitch pine, which require fire to reproduce, is diminishing because of fire suppression practices. There are 128 acres of possible old growth forests; three small tracts south of Panther Knob and several along the border on Iron Mountain. And there is a small tract at least 140 years old. Ecological community types include 21 acres of Dry and Dry-Mesic Oak-Pine, 102 acres of Dry Mesic Oak, 4 acres of Mixed and Western Mesophytic, and 1 acre of Xeric Pine and Pine-oak. The golden-crowned kinglet, associated with mature forests and rare in Virginia, is found in the area. Turkeys are featured species. There are about seven acres of maintained wildlife openings. Streams in the area are recognized for their water quality. Wild natural trout streams in Virginia are classified by the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries by their water quality, with class i the highest and class iv the lowest.9VAC25-260-370. Classification Column.: 9VAC25-260-370. Classification Column., accessdate: April 23, 2018 Kinser and Jones Creeks are class iii streams. Topography As part of the Southern Blue Ridge Mountains Subsection within the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province, there are tectonic uplifted mountain ranges composed of igneous and metamorphic rock with many high gradient, deeply incised streams. Buzzard Rock and Panther Knob are dominant high points. The area is drained by Kinser Creek, through the middle, and Jones Creek, on the north. Both streams flow into Cripple Creek, about three miles north of the area. Elevations range from 2540 feet on Jones Creek near the northern border, to 4000 feet near the summit of Comers Rock, a prominent high point to the southeast. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. The area was inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore protected from possible road construction and timber sales. Hale Lake and Comers Rock Campground are recreational resources adjacent to the area. On the south, Hale Lake, a five-acre lake built in the 1960s, has a one-mile loop trail and parking for 20 vehicles. Comers Rock Campground, on the southeastern border with ten camp sites, is 0.5 miles from the Comers Rock overlook, an observation platform with a ‚Äúdramatic‚Äù 360 degree view of the surroundings. Cultural history A survey for cultural resources within 151 acres of the area found two prehistoric transient camps and a historic cabin complex. There is a potential for additional historic resources. An old road into the area, in the southwest corner, was used to access several old cabins 0.5 miles from the boundary. Only the foundations of the cabins remain, as well as an open 20 foot by 20 foot concrete reservoir that supplied water to the cabins.

From the year 1906 women's organizations were formed and many women participated in constitutionalism. But the National Women's Movement was just a minority movement and part of the great national movement of Iran with the goal of the independence of the country and the implementation of the constitution. The participation of women in these political events was spontaneous, with their new nationalist sentiment and willingness to be recognized.\\" 426\\"Eliz Sanasarianÿå pp. 42‚Äì44 Women's organizations were assorted and numerous in the Constitutional Revolution. During the first period of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution, the establishment of the right to equality and the elimination of oppression of women, were numerous.\\"parsa\\" Ÿæÿßÿ±ÿ≥ÿß ÿ®ŸÜÿßÿ®ÿå €åŸàŸÜÿ≥ The external activities *external activity of women increased during the political transformations of the Constitutional Revolution. Private associations and secret organizations, participation in demonstrations, and for constitutionalism, both armed struggle and non-violent acts were some of the activities that the women held and contributed.Eliz Sanasarianÿå page. 38 Although the Constitution of the Persian Constitution of 1906 eventually neglected many of women's rights (Marriage laws, divorces, child care, etc.), women were deprived of their right to vote, along with those known as criminals.Eliz Sanasarianÿå page. 30 Background In the Qajar period, women's attitudes to acceptance were fate and surrender. For example, girls were taught to sit quietly and have little mobility, not to question and had to obey men-even their younger brother. This socialization pattern continued until many periods later. At that time, no social group could defend its rights and interests. This became more intense for women in terms of the gender segregation that existed at that time.They were faced severe restrictions, such as being deprived in relationship and interaction with the outside world. The beginning of the constitution In the early stages of the Constitutional Revolution (late 1891 ‚Äì early 1901), women were mostly influenced by clerics. But, because of their support for constitutionalism, they managed to emerge from their homes and participated in demonstrations and other behaviors that were considered non-traditional, such as the \\"rioting of bread\\". Slowly the movement of women became more tangible and more independent. They set up associations, private courses, and did social awareness activities which made them become more active and grew higher in the world outside their homes. Some women's associations and organizations organized armed battles for constitution. For example, in the armed struggle between pro-opposition and constitutional opposition in Azerbaijan, 20 women were found dead in men's clothing. In 1911, when it was rumored that some parliamentarians gave up themselves to the demands of the Russians, about 300 women went to the parliament with a pistol to force them to protect the country's freedom and territorial integrity.Eliz Sanasarianÿå page. 39-41 In Azerbaijan, we can see the Zainab Pasha uprising in 1931. This was when the armed struggle began to rise, many women were secretly involved in men's clothing, and some of them were accidentally known. For example, a soldier who had been injured and was to be treated at the clinic refused any therapy. The refusing reached to the point where Sattar Khan came and asks him, \\"My son, you should not die. We need your strength, we need your iron will. Why don't you let them cure your wound? And the soldier in whispers in his ear, saying that I am a woman\\". Another recorded case illustrates that during one of the fights in Azerbaijan, a group of 20 dead constitutionalists were found and, it became clear that all of them were women.ŸÜÿßŸá€åÿØÿå ÿπÿ®ÿØÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜ page. 86 Women's associations did a lot of non-violent actions in defense of the constitution, as well as forcing Britain and Russia to leave Iran. Also during the establishment of the National bank by the Parliament, they sold jewelries and purchased shares from the government. Modern women were boycotting foreign goods, for example, they tried to persuade cafes to shut down sugar imports. These associations held massive meetings about the role of women in the 1911 national movement to remove Britain and Russia from Iran. At one of the meetings between the women's associations and the Russian delegation, the panel tried to convince women that, because the Iranian constitution does not observe women's rights in Iran, they should not try to protect it. But the women's groups‚Äô responses were that they are dissatisfied with their own circumstances, and the culprit is the political complexity of the presence of foreign powers. The women's groups even contacted women activists in England in 1911, asking them to use the British government's political influence to support the Iranians. But, unfortunately, they responded that they have no political privilege in their government and power to support the Iranian people.  Women and Conquer Tehran in the Constitutional Revolution  Commander Bibi Maryam Bakhtiari known as the daughter of Hossein-Gholi Khan Ilkhani, sister of Ali-Qoli Khan Bakhtiari, Commander Asad, and wife of Zargham Al-Saltanah Bakhtiari, was one of the constitutional revolutionary women. She was a well-educated and an enlightened woman during that period of time. Bibi Maryam rose to support freedom-loving ones and did not hesitate to do anything about it. She was also an expert in shooting and horse racing techniques. Since she was the Khan's spouse, she had the opportunity to be in charge of horse riders, and was supported by constitutionalists at urgent times of wars. Commander Bibi Maryam Bakhtiari was one of the main proponents of Ali-Qoli Khan Bakhtiari to conquer Tehran. She wrote in various letters and telegrams between the heads of the tribe and the spectacular speeches of the tribe's leaders to fight the minor tyranny (Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar's tyranny). Bibi Maryam was also known as one of the anti-colonial and authoritarian characters of the Qajar era. Commander Bibi Maryam Bakhtiari, before the Triumph of Tehran, secretly entered Tehran with some of the riders and settled down in her father's house, Hossein Saghafi. Once the attack on Sardar Asad was brought to Tehran, she stoned the roof of the house overlooking Baharestan Square, and with some of Bakhtiari's riders, engaged in the war. She even captured a gun herself and fought with Ghazaghan. Her role in conquering Tehran increased her popularity in the tribe and gained a lot of supporters, who honored her as a commander. Women's organizations The great constitutional writers like Ahmad Kasravi, Melkzadeh, Adamiat, Nezam Mafi, Mohit Mafi, Nazem al-Islam Kermani, Safa'i, Sediqeh Dowlatabadi, and Rezvani conceive in their works references to women's organizations in the revolution: There is no information from these associations, since many of them had worked in secret. Morgan Schuster also writes in the book, \\"Contradiction Iran\\" on how he had dealt with the women constitutional associations several times. For example, once through the Treasury Office Secretary, he and his wife were told not to go with the monarchists. When he asked how you know about my spouse coming and going with the monarchists, he gets the response that your spouse's mother who is a member of the women's secret associations had sent the message.ŸÜÿßŸá€åÿØÿå ÿπÿ®ÿØÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ≥€åŸÜ page. 95 Women's organizations: * Women's Freedom Association in 1907 * Patriotic Drug Association in 1910 * Women's Absence Union in 1907 * Iranian Women's Association in 1910 * Native Women's Association in 1910 * Khatoon Iran Co. 1910 * Women's Union in 1911 * Great Women's Efforts Association in 1911 * Central Board of Great Women Council in 1911 After the Constitutional Revolution Only a few pro-constitutional women were activists for women's rights. The first women who participated in the Iranian Women's Rights Movement were constitutionalists themselves or activists of the national movement of the 1901 such as Sediqeh Dowlatabadi, Banoo Amir Sahi Mahsultan, or those from nationalistic intellectual families, such as Mohtaram Eskandari. After the constitutional went down, the mass of uneducated women returned to their former affiliations, and only the educated and enlightened women of the Women's Rights Movement continued their activities for women rights. At that time, constitutional intellectual men such as Mirzadeh Eshghi, Malkolshaera Bahar, Iraj Mirza, and ... supported the newly-created Women's Rights Movement, especially the right to education and the abandonment of the veil. For example, on 12 August 1911, Haj Mohammad Taghi Vakilalaraia, the parliament's first MP in Iran, raised the issue of equality between men and women in the Shura Council and called for women's right to vote. This shocked the parliament and faced opposition from one of the clerics in the parliament. Although these supports were not very fruitful, but they were more significant than supporting the demands of women during the 1979 revolution.Janet Afari. Women's Semi-constitutions in the Constitutional Movement, =Sediqeh Dowlatabadi= Sediqeh Dowlatabadi (1882‚Äì1982) was an Iranian journalist and activist of the Constitutional Revolution and the Women's Movement in Iran. Eliz Sanasarianÿå pages.62‚Äì63 She was the founder of the constitutional forum of the Patriotic Association. Eliz Sanasarianÿå page. 43 She later became the first female rights activist in Iran and published the Women's Language Journal on women's rights. Dowlatabadi was born in Isfahan in 1882. Her father's name was Haj Mirza Hadi Dolatabadi and her mother's name was Khatemeh Bigom. Her father was known as a modern cleric of that time. Sedigheh Dowlatabadi began her education in Persian and Arabic in Tehran. Then she continued her secondary education at Dar Al Fonoun. She was fifteen years old when she married Dr. Adzad Al-Hakma. But, their marriage didn't last long. In 1917, with her efforts, she opened one of the first elementary girls' schools, named \\"Shariah School\\". Her father, Haj Seyyed Mirza Hadi Dolatabadi, was a well-known local and renowned clergyman who led the elderly branch of Babiyah.ÿØÿßŸÜÿ¥ŸÜÿßŸÖŸá ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ€å⁄©ÿß His father, ·∏§ƒÅjj Sayyed Mƒ´rzƒÅ HƒÅdƒ´ DawlatƒÅbƒÅdƒ´,reputed to have been leader of the Azalƒ´ Babis (q.v. i) in Persia. He was the representative of Sobeh Azal in Iran. The events leading up to the Constitutional Revolution opened a new chapter in the life of Yahya Dolatabadi and his younger brother Ali Mohammed. They were among the first members of the small but influential circle of elderly believers (Azali) who included Jamal Al-Din Vaez Esfahani and Malik Al-Mutkelimin.An encounter with the ascetic Babi preacher Shaikh Mo·∏•ammad Man≈°ƒÅdƒ´ Yazdƒ´ influenced him, as well as two other, later proponents of the Constitutional Revolution (q.v.), Na·π£r-AllƒÅh Behe≈°tƒ´ (later Malek-al-Motakallemƒ´n) and JamƒÅl-al-Dƒ´n WƒÅ øe·∫ì E·π£fahƒÅnƒ´. The thoughts of Sheikh Mohammad Munshahidi Yazdi, who was said to be from the Azali believers had influenced him along with Jamal Al-Din Vaez Esfahani and Malik Al-Mutkelimin. Sediqeh Dowlatabadi died in Tehran on 6 August 1961 at the age of 80. She was buried next to her brother in the cemetery of Imam Zadeh Esmail in Zargerte. Some ruined her tomb after the 1979 revolution.

He was a member of the Marwanid lineage and the only Andalusian Umayyad caliph not descended from  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn III.D. J. Wasserstein, \\"Mu _dj_ ƒÅhid, al-Muwaffa·∏≥ ibn  øAbd AllƒÅh al- øƒÄmiri, Abu  æl- _Dj_ ay _sh_ \\", The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. VII (Leiden: Brill, 1993), pp. 292‚Äì93. He was a puppet of his ·∏•ƒÅjib (chamberlain) MujƒÅhid al- øƒÄmirƒ´, who was the actual ruler of the kingdom of D√©nia. His authority did not extended beyond D√©nia and the Balearic Islands. Al-Mu øay·π≠ƒ´'s name consists of the kunya, Ab≈´  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn (meaning \\"father of  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn\\"); his actual given name,  øAbd AllƒÅh; and a series of patronymics indicating his descent from his father,  øUbayd AllƒÅh, as far back as an author wished to go. The historian Ibn BashkuwƒÅl recorded al- Mu øay·π≠ƒ´'s genealogy back to Umayya ibn  øAbd Shams, namesake of the dynasty. The name al-Mu øay·π≠ƒ´ itself indicates that he belonged to the branch descended from Abƒ´ Mu øay·π≠.F√©lix Retamero, \\"La formalizaci√≥n del poder de los mul≈´k de Denia (siglo V h./XI d.C.)\\", Al-Qan·π≠ara '27, 2 (2006): 417‚Äì45. The seizure of Almer√≠a by MujƒÅhid's rival, KhayrƒÅn, in July 1014 provided the impetus for MujƒÅhid to legitimise his rule by proclaiming a caliph of his own.  øAbd AllƒÅh ibn  øUbayd AllƒÅh al-Mu øay·π≠ƒ´, as a descendant of Mu·∏•ammad and of the Qurayshƒ´ tribe, was a legitimate claimant. He was a faqƒ´h (religious scholar), originally from Egypt, who had fled C√≥rdoba and sought refuge in D√©nia when SulaymƒÅn, with an army of Berbers, had deposed the caliph HishƒÅm II in 1013. He was proclaimed caliph in December 1014 with the honorific title al-Munta·π£ir bi ællƒÅh (Victor in God).Peter C. Scales, The Fall of the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba: Berbers and Andalusis in Conflict (Leiden: Brill, 1994), p. 137. MujƒÅhid then performed the bay øa (oath of allegiance) and was appointed ·∏•ƒÅjib.Scales (1994), p. 92.

Although the da øwa (call) of al-Mu øay·π≠ƒ´ was not widely heeded outside of the lands ruled by MujƒÅhid,Scales (1994), p. 97. it did receive the support of the great scholar Ibn ·∏§azm when in 1016 al-Mu øay·π≠ƒ´ was briefly the only Umayyad claimant. For this, the scholar was imprisoned by KhayrƒÅn, a support of the non-Umayyad caliph.Bruno Soravia, \\"A Portrait of the  øƒÅlim as a Young Man: The Formative Years of Ibn ·∏§azm, 404/1013‚Äì420/1029\\", Ibn ·∏§azm of Cordoba: The Life and Works of a Controversial Thinker (Leiden: Brill, 2013), pp. 25‚Äì50, at 34. Within months of al-Mu øay·π≠ƒ´'s appointment, MujƒÅhid set out on an expedition to conquer the island of Sardinia in the name of the new caliph. During his absence, an uprising led by  øAlƒ´ ibn ·∏§amm≈´d deposed and executed SulaymƒÅn. According to the historian Ibn  øIdhƒÅri, SulaymƒÅn was distracted by the elevation of al- Mu øay·π≠ƒ´ as his rival and did not foresee the uprising of  øAlƒ´, who soon had himself, although a non-Umayyad, proclaimed caliph. Al-Mu øay·π≠ƒ´ himself took advantage of MujƒÅhid's absence to assert his own authority. When the ·∏•ƒÅjib returned from his second failed expedition to Sardinia in 1016, he deposed al- Mu øay·π≠ƒ´ and exiled him to Africa. There he \\"eked out his remaining days as a wandering teacher, no doubt enthralling his pupils with tall stories of how he had once been the successor of the Prophet\\".D. J. Wasserstein, The Caliphate in the West: An Islamic Political Institution in the Iberian Peninsula (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992), p. 127. He died in 1041, either at KutƒÅma in Morocco or at Baghdad. With al-Mu øay·π≠ƒ´ removed, MujƒÅhid recognised SulaymƒÅn ibn al-Musta øƒ´n's successor in C√≥rdoba,  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn al-Murta·∏çƒÅ, as caliph in 1017 or 1018. It has even been suggested that al-Mu øay·π≠ƒ´'s deposition was precipitated by the need for a united front against the anti-Umayyad usurpers of the ·∏§amm≈´did dynasty after 1016.

She worked for the GHQ Wallinger London unit in 1917-18, reporting to (Sir) Ivone Kirkpatrick who was based in Rotterdam. Anne Dawson was one of only two known British female agents operating behind German lines in Flanders, the other being Edith Cavell who had been a long time resident of Belgium prior to WW1. Early life Anne Dawson was born in Camberwell County, London on 29 October 1896. Her birth certificate shows her (Dutch) given names to be Anna Henderika. Her father, Francis Dawson was British and her mother, Catherine Dawson (n√©e Steffer), was born into a Dutch family that had migrated from Eastern Europe to Holland around the middle of the 19th century. They appear to have settled in The Hague, where the birth of Catherine's older sister Jaantje Steffer was registered in 1865. The family was most likely of Jewish descent, but if so there is no evidence that it any longer observed any religious or cultural practices. Catherine had left Holland to move to England, where she married Francis in the mid 1890s. The Dawsons had three children, Anne, Frank Gerard, and Catherine Mina. Catherine spoke Dutch to her children. After the birth of the third child, her husband - who was a partner in a timber business with his brothers - left the family and never returned. He died in 1948. Anne, as the eldest child in a fatherless household, grew up assisting her mother to care for her younger siblings. Catherine's sister, Jaantje Steffer (by then Oudshoorn) appears in the 1911 Census as a Dutch visitor to the Dawson household, together with her daughter. When Anne left home for her war duty she would have been twenty, and her siblings in their later teens. She appears never to have lived in England again. Her mother became ill in England in the late 1920s and returned to Holland, where Anne had settled in Roosendaal. Anne took care of Catherine until the latter's death in 1929. Little is known about Anne's youth, as she never spoke about it. Her children would later learn that questions about her past were unwelcome. It is known however from her sister Catherine that Anne was a prizewinning scholar who excelled in languages, including Latin and Greek. Besides her English, Anne was fluent in Dutch, with a good grasp of French and German. First World War At some stage during the First World War she joined an intelligence unit that reported to GHQ Army, for covert work behind enemy lines. As a good linguist and a natural Dutch-speaker she would have been an obvious candidate for operations in Flemish-speaking Belgium. Her unit, named ‚ÄòWallinger London‚Äô, operated at first in Britain, interviewing both refugees and ordinary travellers arriving daily in Tilbury, and from 1917 was active in Rotterdam. In a conversation with her eldest son just before her death in 1989, Anne confirmed that her work for Wallinger consisted of making ‚Äòenquiries from refugees and locals about German troop movements to and from the front lines‚Äô, and making ‚Äòreports‚Äô that she then handed to her ‚Äòliaison officers (Ivone, later Sir Ivone) Kirkpatrick and (George) Bennett‚Äô, at the Dutch border. That type of work would have carried a huge risk for Anne. Getting caught as a British citizen doing covert work in German occupied territories would have meant almost certain execution. It was unusual for the British intelligence services to use British citizens behind the German lines in the First World War. Edith Cavell was a rare other example, but nurse Cavell had lived in Belgium since well before the war. British intelligence services normally preferred to use locals for such work. The high level of danger that Anne was exposed to, especially as a British national and non- resident, would have been one reason for her being awarded the insignia of a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in the New Year's honours of 1920. The then still military award had been created in 1917 to recognise outstanding service of civilians and non-combatant officers to the military. thumb The insignia of the Military MBE Anne received in Koblenz, Germany in 1920. Donated to the Imperial War Museum London by Anne Dawson's family in July 2017 Inter-Allied Rhineland High Commission After the war, from 1919 to 1922, Anne first worked for Sir Harold Stewart, British High Commissioner to the Inter-Allied Rhineland High Commission based in Koblenz, and from late 1920 for Victor Hay, 21st Earl of Erroll, Stuart's successor. It is not known what she did there, as she never spoke about it. In the 1989 conversation referred to above she merely confirmed that she had worked at the High Commission and that it was the British High Commissioner who handed her the award in 1920. She must have declined an invitation to travel to Buckingham Palace for the ceremony. That urge to keep a low public profile would prove a blessing to her two decades later. Post-war years After leaving the High Commission, in 1922, she started on a degree in English literature at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, graduating in 1927. Simultaneously Anne commenced teaching part- time at St Norbertus Lyceum in Roosendaal, where she would later buy a house with a friend and colleague, Hildegonda Rijckholt. Sometime after the war, Anne had adopted Roman Catholicism, although in later life she was first to challenge many of its doctrines and teachings and then gradually to abandon the faith altogether. From an essay on the history of the lyceum it appears that there were doubts amongst members of the lyceum council as to whether she ‚Äòconducted herself in a sufficiently Catholic way‚Äô. Perhaps to erase those doubts she wrote a pamphlet on Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman's ‚ÄòFabiola or the Church of the Catacombs‚Äô. She nevertheless twice came close to her appointment not being renewed. The essay refers to tensions in the council about having a female English teacher for the senior forms. It mentions that in the early years, when Anne's annual reappointments came up, fierce debates would rage about the presence of women in those forms - even though academically and didactically Anne ticked all the boxes ‚Äì and permanent appointments for female teachers remained a controversial issue for years to come. Further issues came up: in deeply conservative Roosendaal, worried parents complained about ‚Äòthe way she dressed‚Äô, and there was criticism in the council regarding Anne and Hildegonda's ‚Äòeccentric lifestyle‚Äô. Personal life Anne was introduced to her future husband in Roosendaal around 1928. She called off their subsequent engagement when she had to care for her seriously ill mother. The two however got together again after Anne's mother died in 1929. Anne married Xavier Fran√ßois Marie G√©rard Wolters, a Dutch national and resident, in England in 1931. In addition to having graduated in classic languages, Xavier was a true polymath, whose serious spare time interests ranged from astronomy to electronics, engineering, journalism and poetry. Anne and Xavier moved to Eindhoven in 1932, after Xavier had been advised not to apply for a permanent vacancy to teach Latin and Greek at St Norbertus, on the basis that ‚Äòit was feared that he as an independent thinker would have a negative influence on critical elements of the teaching staff‚Äô. Eindhoven had for seven centuries been a small market town that had grown exponentially after Anton and Gerard Philips established an industrial empire there in the 1890s. Its population was much more open and diverse than Roosendaal's as the development of electronics and engineering industries had attracted bright scientists and engineers from far and wide. Both Anne and Xavier flourished there in their own ways. Second World War in Holland They would have five of their six children by the time Holland was invaded by the Nazis in May 1940. Anne had given them English names (Patricia Mary, Eileen Flavia, Sheila Anne, John William, and Donald Robert), and after the birth of their first child, at her wish, the family's daily language would change to English. English continued to be spoken in the big white house at 164 Geldropsweg Eindhoven right through the Nazi occupation, although it abruptly stopped outdoors after one of the children, to his parents‚Äô horror, spoke English on a train when a uniformed German unexpectedly boarded it and sat down in their compartment. It fortunately had no consequences because the soldier would most likely not have recognised the language. It is a testament to Anne's feeling of pride as a Briton and contempt for the Nazi regime, and to her steely courage, that she called her third son, born in 1942, ‚ÄòFrank Allan‚Äô after the eponymous newsreader of the BBC's broadcasts to occupied Europe. In July 1944, handy with a sewing machine, she could be seen in her living room - with her back to a giant map of Europe with coloured pins indicating Allied progress in Normandy - stitching together the large Union Jack that she would hang out when her British and American liberators reached Eindhoven on 18 September that year. If, as a British citizen living under Nazi occupation, Anne was never interned as an enemy alien, she could thank both the silence of the many people who knew her to be English, and the action of courageous unknown officials in the Eindhoven population registry who changed her name from Anne Dawson to Anna M√ºller, and altered her place of birth. (In Holland, maiden names remain the registered name of a woman; they can, but need not, hyphenate their husband‚Äôs family name in front of their own but this does not affect the status of their registered birth name.) She would not find out about this act of patriotic courage until the end of the war. The same appears to have happened to all of the known British women then living in Eindhoven. Later life Anne Dawson at home in Eindhoven, Holland 1989 Life as a housewife was not what Anne most relished. Although she loved cooking, the remainder of household tasks was left to others, so that she could engage in her passions. She was an amateur painter and loved sketching, although writing was her real forte. Before the war she published two children's books and one major historical novel, ‚ÄòCardinal, Chancellor and King‚Äô in Dutch. Shortly before that she had managed to nudge Xavier towards completion of his doctoral thesis, which she translated into English. After the publication of her second historical novel ‚ÄòMary d‚ÄôArcy‚Äô, in 1948, she no longer wrote books. For a long time she threw her energy into translating a major academic work - requiring familiarity with classic mythology, folklore and history - into English. She found time to study Hebrew and Italian, and would read Roman writers in the original. She had long before that taken up secondary teaching again and did so until her retirement age. Anne later did voluntary work translating the publications of a religious charity operating in Communist Eastern Europe, and frequently coached individual tertiary students in literature and Middle English. Indefatigable and fiercely proud, with her full mental capacities and never accepting her advancing age, she died on 9 October 1989, three weeks short of her 93rd birthday.
