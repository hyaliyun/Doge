All of his beats are produced by Paper Platoon, which is also the name of his unique collective that includes visual artists and musicians. Spark Master Tape‚Äôs second mixtape, 2013‚Äôs The #SWOUP Serengeti, was described by Mishka NYC as, ‚Äúenough bump and 808s to satisfy y‚Äôall that think Juicy J is god and enough verbal dexterity to have everyone that misses the old days of rappity rapping.‚Äù Masking his voice by pitching it down and sampling everything from 2pac to rare soul, Spark Master Tape has been described as ‚Äúa gimmick, a sonic choice, or something in- between.‚Äù In 2014, Spark Master Tape became unresponsive. His Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram had been abandoned. There was no information about Spark's whereabouts. The rest of the Paper Platoon collective were also gone. Rumors circulated that he may be in prison, but were never plausibly confirmed nor denied. No official word was given by anyone in Paper Platoon. On January 25, 2016, after about two years since his mysterious disappearance, Spark Master Tape tweeted \\"#SWOUP\\". This was the first communication from Spark since 2014. A week or so later, a video was posted to the official Spark Master Tape YouTube and Facebook, which showed a small group of people, filmed in black and white, wearing strange masks. At the end of this video, which was titled \\"SUNKKEN\\", words appear on the screen that say \\"Silhouette of a Sunkken City\\" and \\"March\\". This is in reference to his long-awaited third album, Silhouette of a Sunkken City. He then released his first song since his return, \\"Livin' Lavish\\", on February 19. The music video for \\"Livin' Lavish\\" was released on February 23. In an interview with The Fader explaining his new video and sudden return, Spark Master Tape said, ‚Äú2016 the year of that sewage and garbage, we out here militant and ignorant.

Life and career Rayment was born in West Hartlepool, County Durham. His father, also called Joe, had played football for Hartlepools United in the 1920s. Rayment began his football career as a youngster with First Division club Middlesbrough, while doing an electrical engineering apprenticeship at a local company. Having spent the 1951‚Äì52 season in the fourth team, and beginning the 1952‚Äì53 in the third eleven, Rayment made his first-team debut on 20 September 1952, at the age of 17, in a 4‚Äì1 defeat away to Liverpool. Middlesbrough's manager suggested the club would be abandoning their policy of paying big transfer fees to concentrate instead on producing home-grown players, and wanted Rayment to commit to the club as a full-time player, but his reluctance to abandon his apprenticeship prevented him from so doing. By the start of the 1954‚Äì55 season, new manager Bob Dennison reportedly had \\"great hopes\\" of the club's youngsters, Rayment included, but his engineering employer sacked him for losing too much time to his football commitments. A company spokesman said that although staff participation in sport was encouraged, \\"there is a limit and he must make up his mind whether he wants to be one thing or another.\\" Rayment himself said he had tried to do his best for both parties, but because the apprenticeship was important to him, he left Middlesbrough and joined Hartlepools United, where he was able to complete his final year with a local firm. His Hartlepools career was also interrupted by the requirement for National Service. Rayment served with a Royal Engineers bomb disposal squad based in Sussex, more than distant. He was able to appear for the club when military duties permitted. Over three years with Hartlepools, he scored 17 goals from 65 matches in League and FA Cup, and signed as a full-time professional for local rivals Darlington in 1958. In the inaugural season of the League Cup competition, Rayment made a significant contribution to Darlington reaching the third round, and coming close to taking First Division Bolton Wanderers to a replay. In the first round, Rayment scored the only goal of the first-round match against Crystal Palace after missing several chances. In the next round they beat First Division club West Ham United 3‚Äì2: Rayment scored the second and debutant Lance Robson, then a dental student, the winner. In front of a club record attendance of 21,023, Rayment opened the scoring after 16 minutes of the third round, against Bolton, with what the Guardian's reporter called \\"a terrific shot\\", but the First Division side, with England international Nat Lofthouse at centre forward, came back to win 2‚Äì1 in the last seconds of the match. Rayment remained with Darlington for seven seasons. He scored 28 goals from 173 league appearances, all in the Fourth Division. He finished his football career with a season at Gateshead, then playing in the North Regional League. He helped the club reach the second round proper of the 1965‚Äì66 FA Cup, in which they lost 4‚Äì0 at home to Hull City. After leaving football, Rayment spent eight years as an engineer in the Merchant Navy. He was married three times. He died in North Tees Hospital, Stockton, in July 2019 at the age of 84.

Life Born around 1160, Domald was the son of a ≈æupan, or Count, of Klis in Dalmatia. According to historian John V. A. Fine, he most probably was a member of the noble Kaƒçiƒá family. Domald held ≈†ibenik and Klis and possessed lands in the region between the Krka River, the Adriatic Sea and Zadar. The townspeople of Split elected him their Prince in 1209. Having captured Zadar from the Republic of Venice in the same year, the grateful citizens also elected him its Count. His rule in Zadar proved to be short-lived, because the town accepted the suzerainty of the Republic without resistance after the Venetian navy approached its port in 1210. In the same year, King Andrew II of Hungary, who ruled Dalmatia, bestowed upon Domald the ≈æupa, or county, of Cetina. He was expelled from Split by the citizens in 1221. The citizens of Split elected a member of the ≈†ubiƒá family, Visan of Zvonigrad their new Prince, causing a feud between Domald and the ≈†ubiƒái. King Andrew's son, Duke B√©la, who administered Dalmatia at that time, intervened in the conflict on behalf of Domald's opponents in 1223. The Duke laid siege and seized the Fortress of Klis. Domald was forced to renounce his domains which were distributed among his opponents. Domald died in 1243.

He signed for Second Division club West Ham United on 31 May 1946, ahead of the first postwar Football League season. He made his debut towards the end of that campaign, and played just once in 1947‚Äì48, but became a more frequent member of the first eleven over the next couple of years. An injury sustained in a 1‚Äì0 defeat of Queens Park Rangers on 4 February 1950 put an early end to his 1949‚Äì50 season, and although a regular selection in August and September 1950 he picked up an injury while contributing two own goals to a 5‚Äì3 loss at home to Sheffield United, lost his place, and rarely regained it. He played just nine more league matches over the next two-and-a-half years. Devlin returned to the north-east to sign for Third Division North club Darlington in 1953. He remained with the club for four years, and played 115 league matches. He scored just once, the first goal in a 3‚Äì0 home win against Workington on 19 April 1954.

Co-founder of the Ark Project (1992-2005), she was founding president of the Independent Investigation into Raoul Wallenberg‚Äôs Fate, an educational human rights organization that furthers groundbreaking research carried out in the former Soviet Union, independently (1992 ‚Äì 2003) and under the aegis of an official Swedish-Russian working group (1991 ‚Äì 2001). Early life and education Mesinai was born September 25, 1942 in Detroit, Michigan to Manuel Bromberg, war artist for the European Theatre (1943‚Äì45) and Jane Dow Bromberg.They Drew Fire, Brian Lanker and Nicole Newnham, TV Books, May 1, 2000. ‚ÄúSnapshots of War,‚Äù The Guardian, Adam Levy, May 14, 2004. Her father‚Äôs career as a painter, muralist, and professor of art and design placed her as a child in North Carolina, Europe and Woodstock, New York where she graduated salutatorian from Onteora Central School. During these years she had personal contact with Buckminster Fuller, James Shotwell, Eleanor Roosevelt and Gore Vidal who each influenced her direction in life.‚ÄúWheels Within Wheels: Dreams of Resurrection and Return,‚Äù Susan Mesinai, Parabola Magazine. Summer 2003. Mesinai entered Barnard College in 1960, intent upon a diplomatic career. However, her correspondence with Nobel Prize-winning author Hermann Hesse led instead to her study of myth, philosophy and comparative religion. A student of the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr and his wife Ursula,Niebuhr papers, Manuscript Collection of the Library of Congress, Susan Mesinai file. she graduated magna cum laude from the Columbia University School of General Studies in 1965. From 1983-85, she studied philosophy at Jewish Theological Seminary, where she continued the project that led to the 1994 publication of Shlomo‚Äôs Stories.Ophir, Nathan. Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach: Life, Mission & Legacy. Urim Publications, January 5, 2014. In 2004 Mesinai was designated, on an honor roll of 250 alumni spanning a 250-anniversary period, as Number 199 of Columbia University‚Äôs ‚Äúgreatest graduates.‚Äù Her selection was in response to her research into the Raoul Wallenberg case and her continued concern for the rights for the Disappeared.  Career  Susan Mesinai is best known for her efforts to resolve the case of missing Swedish diplomat, Raoul Wallenberg. Wallenberg was revered for saving thousands of Jews from genocide in Nazi- occupied Hungary in the last half of 1944, and disappeared from Budapest on January 17, 1945. His status as a neutral and a diplomat as well as his humanitarian achievements fuel an ongoing international interest in determining his actual fate. In 1981, as assistant to Dr. Irving Greenberg, then chairman of the U.S. President‚Äôs Commission on the Holocaust, Mesinai read a confidential eyewitness report that stated that Raoul Wallenberg remained alive in captivity, and posted a letter to him in the reported prison location. She would not become directly involved in the Wallenberg case until October 1989, after Soviet authorities returned Wallenberg's possessions to his next-of-kin, acknowledging their ‚Äútragic mistake,‚Äù but failing to present any evidence of his death. At this point, Mesinai states, she committed herself to the task of ascertaining Wallenberg's fate ‚Äúbeyond reasonable doubt.‚Äù\\"Beyond Reasonable Doubt\\" (\\"Ryssarna doljer viktiga uppgifter\\"), Dagens Nyheter, January 4, 2001. In 1991, Mesinai and Mikhail Kazachkov, a recently released Soviet prisoner, created the Ark Project, dedicated to enforcing ‚Äúrule of law‚Äù in the case of foreign prisoners in the Gulag. Kazachkov and Mesinai initiated a trans-Russia appeal for information regarding missing American prisoners of war, both through publication in the human rights press and radio networking. Ark's discovery of Victor Hamilton, a former NSA cryptologist being held in a psychiatric prison hospital under another name in the Soviet Union, was world news.‚ÄúAmerican Defector Found in Soviet Prisons‚Äù, New York Times, June 4, 1992.‚ÄúThe Defector Time Forgot,‚Äù Doug Stanglin, US News & World Report, June 15, 1992.Good Morning America with Lillie Belle Hamilton, June 1992. Because of this case and others in which she became involved, Mesinai was able to establish that anonymous foreign prisoners or dual nationals were still being held in asylums and psychiatric facilities throughout the former Soviet Union. Ark also worked with the families of American pilots lost in Cold War shoot-downs, leading to extensive media coverage through the NBC News Moscow Bureau, as well as a prize-winning article in U.S. News & World Report, in which Mesinai spoke of the Soviets' ‚Äúpolicy of denial.‚Äù .‚ÄùNBC News and Dateline, 1992‚ÄúSecrets of the Cold War,‚Äù U.S. News & World Report, March 15, 1993. In 1994, at the invitation of Wallenberg‚Äôs half-brother, Dr. Guy von Dardel, Mesinai became an ad hoc consultant to the official Swedish-Russian Working Group on Raoul Wallenberg‚Äôs Fate and instigated an archival research project to seek traces of Wallenberg in psychiatric facilities in Western Russia. As the majority of the earlier records had been removed to the East, she reverted to her comprehensive study of eyewitness reports, focusing also on other Swedes in the Gulag who could be mistaken for Wallenberg.‚ÄúSomebody‚Äôs Swede,‚Äù (‚ÄúFler Svenskar I Moskas fanglager,‚Äù) Dagens Nyheter, July 5, 2002.\\"New Clues in Mystery Behind Holocaust Hero,\\" Associated Press, April 28, 2008. In 1997, after assisting U.S. News & World Report with the reporting for a feature article, ‚ÄúThe Angel Was A Spy,‚Äù Mesinai was employed by the Government of Sweden to do a full-time study of selected cellmates, indirect eyewitnesses and analogous cases, which might offer a paper trail that could lead back to Wallenberg.‚ÄúThe Angel Was a Spy,‚Äù Victoria Pope and Chsrles Fenyevesi, U.S. News and World Report, May 13, 1996. Having gained unprecedented access to numbered prisoner files in 2000, Mesinai was able to place Wallenberg in a series of six missing numbered prisoners, should he have been convicted rather than executed in 1947. That Wallenberg was a numbered prisoner in 1947 was later substantiated by the Russians' admission that he was \\"most likely\\" Prisoner Number 7 interrogated one week after his alleged death date.Max, Arthur and Isachenkov, Vladimir. \\"Wallenberg Possibly Outlived Death Date\\". AP Online, September 26, 2011. In 2001, the Working Group, which had served under different Soviet/Russian leadership for a decade, was disbanded. On January 4, Mesinai addressed the question of Wallenberg‚Äôs returned possessions in an op ed piece in Sweden‚Äôs prominent newspaper, Dagens Nyheter. She argued that according to prison regulations, a prisoner‚Äôs belongings taken at the point of arrest were either confiscated by the State or followed him throughout the Gulag until his repatriation or death. This raised the question of whether the invitation to Wallenberg‚Äôs next of kin in October 1989 was in fulfillment of the requirement that the possessions be returned within six months of a prisoner's death. That same week, Mesinai presented a report at an international press conference in Stockholm titled ‚ÄúLiquidatsia: The Question of Wallenberg‚Äôs Death or Disappearance in 1947‚Äù. Here, Mesinai again challenged the Soviet argument of an early death against the more prevalent practice of ‚Äúdisappearing‚Äù an important prisoner either by giving him a series of false identities, or a number.‚ÄúThe Truth About Wallenberg,‚Äù Dr. Amy Knight. New York Review of Books, September 20, 2001.(Coverage of \\"Liquidatsia: The Question of Wallenberg's Death or Disappearance in 1947,\\" as released in International Press Conference, Prime Minister's Office, Sweden, January 11, 2001) Because of Russian insistence that all documents regarding Wallenberg's fate have been destroyed, Mesinai focuses on reconstructing Wallenberg‚Äôs paper trail through actual prison data as an alternative to a \\"smoking gun\\". In 2007, she joined her independent colleagues, Dr. Marvin Makinen of the University of Chicago, himself a former inmate of Vladimir Prison, and Ari Kaplan, prize-winning mathematician and statistician, to continue their combined studies initiated in Russia between 1997 and 2000. Building upon Makinen and Kaplan‚Äôs original report, Cell Occupancy Analysis of Korpus 2 of the Vladimir Prison, Mesinai focused on day-by-day movements of ‚Äúunlisted‚Äù prisoners, without name or number. Together with Associate Aaron Slavik, who researches Soviet methods of concealment, Mesinai has added seven new findings that would verify previous eyewitness reports. Using the Russians' own registration system, she has further pinpointed one who remains \\"most likely\\" Raoul Wallenberg coming and going from Vladimir Prison over a 25-year period.  Personal life  A former Board member of the Temple of Understanding, an international interfaith organization founded by Juliet Hollister, with Eleanor Roosevelt and Jawaharlal Nehru, Mesinai has worked in the not-for-profit sphere in welfare rights, indigenous rights, Holocaust and Jewish life, and environmental concerns. Mesinai has two children: Maya Draisin Farrah, Associate Publisher, Marketing at Wired and arstechnica.com; and Raz Mesinai, composer, filmmaker and author. She currently resides in New York City.

It is held in a private collection. The painting The painting depicts the recognisable view of Saint-Paul-de-Vence, one of the oldest medieval towns on the French Riviera, dominated by the church at its top. The work is particularly rich in color and has a very balanced composition.MIllionenpreise f√ºr Chagalls Sp√§twerk bei Kornfeld in Bern Die Welt July 14th 2007. Retrieved 31 March 2014. The blue sky above the town contains a large, bright yellow Sun as well as various other elements from the artist's iconography ‚Äì animals, musicians, and the flying couple. By juxtaposing this imagery, Soleil dans le ciel de Saint-Paul combines Chagall's love of his Mediterranean home with his characteristic dream-like pictorial vision. With its free-flowing style and bright, translucent colours, the work exemplifies the effect that the south of France had on Chagall's art.Impressionist, Modern & Surrealist Art Evening Sale Sotheby's London. Retrieved 31 March 2014. ‚ÄòThe Southern French landscape has astonished Chagall with its wealth of colours and its lyrical atmosphere, had captivated him with the beauty of its flowers and foliage. These impressions found their way into his paintings of that period, refined their peinture and lent them a hitherto unknown radiance‚Äô.Walter Erben. \\"Marc Chagall\\". London, 1957, p. 134. With its fantastical, dream-like composition, the painting becomes an expression of the artist's internal feelings and souvenirs rather than an objective projection of the outside world and of the familiar landscape. As such, Chagall's paintings defy symbolic meaning and categorisation. In particular, his dreamscapes resist interpretation despite the ubiquity of repeated pictorial symbols; through repetition they become both familiar and meaningless, manifestations of a rich and colourful imagination that can be understood not through intellect but through intuition. As the artist himself proclaimed: ‚ÄòFor me a picture is a surface covered with representations of things (objects, animals, human beings) in a certain order in which logic and illustration have no importance. The visual effect of the composition is what is paramount‚Äô.Susan Compton. \\"Chagall (exhibition catalogue)\\". Royal Academy of Arts, London, 1985, p. 21.

It has over 200 employees and ¬£25 million turnover. The company founded a social welfare charity, Recycling Lives Charity, and is committed to undertaking only commercial ventures with a demonstrable charity or community benefit. Recycling Lives Limited was founded by entrepreneur and current chief executive Steven Jackson, OBE, who was recognised for his services to employment and the community in Lancashire in the 2013 New Year Honours list.  Recycling and waste management operations  Recycling Lives undertakes a broad range of commercial services for commercial and domestic clients, and public sector organisations. These services include the recycling of scrap metal, end-of-life vehicles, car batteries, waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) including CRTs and FPDs, glass and plastics. The company also offers skip and container hire and waste collection services via the SkipHireNetwork and BulkyWaste websites. They operate a centre for the public to bring in waste and their eBay shop sells salvaged flat panel display parts.  History  Recycling Co Ltd was incorporated on 2 Jun 1999 as company number 03783452 in Berkely Street, Preston. Recycling Lives Limited itself was founded in 2008 following the acquisition of Preston Recycling Limited; changing it into the new social business model in order to provide initial commercial momentum and revenue. In 2009, Recycling Lives Limited opened its first Recycling Lives Centre to members of the public and charity residents after being completed in the previous December. The following year, the company was awarded the Queen‚Äôs Award for Enterprise in Sustainable Development. This was due to, in part, the welfare work such as furniture 'up- cycling' with residents and Shabby2Chic CIC. In March 2011, the firm established the first fully dedicated Flat Panel Display (FPD) recycling centre in England, costing ¬£250,000. This is despite concerns from industry body WRAP about the dangers of mercury in such facilities. It also launched its eBay shop, enabling the company to sell working parts from dismantled FPD units as it prioritises reuse over recycling. In 2012, Recycling Lives was featured as a case study in a report by the Department of Work and Pensions, entitled \\"Social Justice: Transforming Lives\\". Following the ban on cash payments for scrap metal, and the subsequent introduction of the Scrap Metal Dealers Act in 2013, which requires all scrap dealers to be licensed by their local authorities, Recycling Lives developed a top-up trade card system for scrap metal transactions. Similar in use to credit and debit cards, the card allows scrap metal sellers to be paid directly, and can also be used to pay for goods/services and withdraw cash from cash points. Also in 2013, Recycling Lives Limited launched a new scheme, developing FPD processing lines at the Kirkham prison. The scheme gives prisoners the opportunity to learn new skills and earn a wage, while improving local rates of FPD recycling and reducing unnecessary transportation of recyclable materials. The same year saw the Recycling Lives UK charity enter into a 15-year contract with Chorley Borough Council to jointly occupy the Council‚Äôs Bengal Street site and establish scrap metal buying and WEEE recycling facilities there. Planning permission has also been submitted for the conversion of the existing offices on site into accommodation for further charity residents. The company acquired Preston- based skip hire firm, City Skips and its staff in 2013. On 9 April 2015 Recycling Lives suffered a major fire overnight at its Longbridge Road scrap metal site at, which required 15 fire engines and 100 fire-fighters. The fire lasted from 21.40 to 5 o'clock the following morning.  Recycling Lives UK charity  Recycling Lives‚Äôs commercial operations have provided financial support to the Recycling Lives UK social welfare charity via significant annual contributions. Registered as a charity in 2006, Recycling Lives UK (Reg. No. 1116562) did not begin trading immediately but became active in early 2008. It operates throughout England and Wales, Lancashire in particular, and received almost ¬£500,000 in 2014 from its parent company. The charity‚Äôs aim is to tackle poverty by reducing homelessness and unemployment in the community. Participants in the charity‚Äôs six-stage programme, known as residents, are provided with accommodation at a Recycling Lives Centre and offered training, education, financial support and work experience placements that enable them develop life and employability skills. Residents who complete the full programme leave their accommodation at the Recycling Lives Centre when they are in full-time employment and able to live independently. They are provided with a range of floating support services by the Recycling Lives UK team and other local organisations. The charity is planning to expand its operations across Lancashire, and then nationwide. However, the charity still relies on public donations, such as for a minibus to enlarge the area in which it works.  Community Dotcom schemes  Recycling Lives Limited operates a number of charity-led recycling and waste management services via online portals and regional collection partners. These services, known as Community Dotcoms, are available nationwide and include furniture donation, scrap car collection, skip hire, and bulky waste collection. Bookings are made on centralised online systems and sent to the most appropriate collection partner in the local area. The strategy for Community Dotcoms is to prioritise collection partners that are registered charities, offering them long-term support in becoming self-sufficient. Revenues from Community Dotcom services are used to sustain UK charities, including Recycling Lives UK.  Awards and press  Recycling Lives has won a number of local and national awards: *2010 Queen's Award for Enterprise (Sustainable Development) *2014 Queen's Award for Enterprise (Sustainable Development) *2010 LEP Lancashire Green Awards- Best Recycling Project *2010 BAE Systems Bronze Chairman's Award *2011 National Training Awards- Linda Ammon award winner *2011 ESF Sustainable Development Specialist Project Leader Award  References  External links * Recycling Lives - company site * Recycling Lives - Charity site Category:Companies based in Preston Category:Waste management companies of the United Kingdom ","title":"Recycling Lives"},{"id":"42360351","text":"Barbu Brezianu (; March 18, 1909-January 14, 2008) was a Romanian poet, art critic, art historian and judge. Biography Born in Bucharest, he graduated from Spiru Haret National College in 1928, having already shown an interest in modernist literature. It was his mathematics teacher Ion Barbu, also a poet, who nurtured this interest. When the latter, whose class was poor at its subject, heard the boys were publishing the literary magazine Vl«éstarul, he began spending his classes talking to them about Edgar Allan Poe, St√©phane Mallarm√©, Comte de Lautr√©amont, Arthur Rimbaud, Paul Val√©ry and other writers. A number of Brezianu's classmates became prominent in the literary field, Vl«éstarul was edited by Mircea Eliade, two years his senior, and received contributions from Eug√®ne Ionesco, who attended another school. Lauri Lindgren, \\"Un punct de vedere finlandez despre Barbu Brezianu\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 9/2008 Entering the Law Faculty of the University of Bucharest, he received his degree in 1932. His father, also named Barbu, was a lawyer at the High Court of Cassation and Justice, and the son was expected to enter the same profession. His first volume of verse was published in 1929, which upset the father, as people thought he had written it; from then on, the son signed himself \\"Barbu B. Brezianu\\". He eventually became a judge. In 1934, he happened to purchase an 1867 first edition of the Finnish epic Kalevala, in French translation. The League of Nations was holding a contest for the best translation for the following year, the centenary of the work's publication. Working with this copy and with a 1931 French translation, also helped near the end by an employee of the Finnish Legation in Bucharest, he managed to publish a prose translation in 1942, prefaced by Ion Marin Sadoveanu. The Finnish government awarded him the Order of the White Rose of Finland and, in 1985, the Kalevala Medal. In 1943, with Romania and Finland finding themselves on the same side in World War II, Brezianu was a founding member of a friendship society linking the two countries. In 1941, Brezianu worked as grefier (registrar or court reporter) at the military court in Odessa, then part of the Romanian-administered Transnistria Governorate. He had pleasant recollections of the city, marred by the horror he felt at seeing hanged bodies as part of the reprisals for an explosion that killed a number of Romanian and German troops (see 1941 Odessa massacre). Later in the war, he was back in Bucharest. George Arion, \\"Interviu: Barbu Brezianu\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 12/2003 As Romania's justice system came under control of the Romanian Workers' Party and its Justice Minister Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, Brezianu was obliged to leave his work and become an accountant in a wire factory. Soon, he found himself performing forced labor on the Danube‚ÄìBlack Sea Canal, which closed in 1955. Following his release, he was unable to return to legal work, and so he turned to art history and criticism. He wrote studies about Nicolae Tonitza and Nicolae Grigorescu, but his focus, through articles and books published starting in 1964, dealt with Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi. His most important book, which came out in 1974, analyzed Br√¢ncu»ôi's Romanian sculptures.

His debut novel was Relatively Guilty and subsequent works have included Duty Man, and Sharp Practice. He is a lawyer working in criminal defence. Biography McIntyre was born in Linlithgow attending Linlithgow Primary School and Linlithgow Academy. He studied law at the University of Edinburgh. He has been a partner of Russel + Aitken LLP since 1988. McIntyre is married and has four sons. He writes in his spare time, blogs for the Scottish Legal News and coaches East Stirlingshire F.C.'s 1999 youth (under 16) football team. Novelist =Best Defence Series= The protagonist is Robbie Munro, a Scots criminal defence lawyer who tends to do the wrong thing for the right reason or, failing which, for the right price. Robbie's office is situated in the Royal Burgh of Linlithgow; not a stone's throw from the birthplace of Mary Queen of Scots, but the action takes place throughout Scotland and further afield. Based in Scotland and drawing on McIntyre's thirty years as a criminal defence lawyer, there is a rich vein of dry-humour running through the stories which he describes as an antidote to a tendency in crime/legal fiction these days to feature either a serial killer, dispatching people in ever more interesting and gory ways, or very serious lawyers who only ever seem to have one case on the go at any given time. The protagonist, Robbie Munro, is very much a real life lawyer, constantly juggling a series of cases, battling with the Scottish Legal Aid Board and awkward clients, while trying to retain some form of personal life. One gets the distinct impression that McIntyre is not only writing about what he knows, but from the heart and, probably due to his own experiences, can't resist the occasional dig at the Scottish Government and what he sees as its constant meddling with the criminal justice system. Notwithstanding their relatively light-hearted approach, the books open the lid on the Scottish courts, while dealing with some very serious issues. Each story raises an interesting philosophical or ethical question, such as, in the first book in the series, Relatively Guilty, what is crime, and does the end justify the means? Though the plots are often complex, they are never confusing such is McIntyre's deftness of touch. The books have been well received by many fellow professionals, on both sides of the Bar, due to their accuracy in law and procedure and the main character's frank, if sardonic, view on the idiosyncrasies of Scots criminal justice system.

He is Halley Professor of Physics Emeritus at the University of Oxford. Early life and education Taylor was born in Amble, Northumberland, England. His father, William, was a joiner who had been wounded in World War II, and his mother, Ena, was a teacher. In 1949, the family moved to Howick, Northumberland. He was educated at The Duke's School, then an all-boys school in Alnwick. He studied physics at the University of Liverpool, graduating with a first class Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree. He then undertook postgraduate research in atmospheric physics at Jesus College, Oxford under the supervision of Sir John Houghton, and graduated from the University of Oxford with a Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) degree. Academic career In 1970, Taylor joined the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology. He was principal investigator for the first experiment into the meteorology of the atmosphere of Venus, building an instrument for the Pioneer Venus Orbiter that launched in 1978. Arriving at Venus in December 1978, this included the first British-built hardware to travel to another planet. He was also involved in the mission that sent the unmanned spacecraft Galileo to study Jupiter and its moons. In 1980, he returned to Oxford University where he became Professor and Head of Department. Under his leadership, the Group was involved in space missions to study the atmospheres of Earth, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Titan, as well as Mercury, the Moon, and a comet. In 1999, one of the Oxford projects placed the first British-built hardware on the surface of Mars, albeit unwittingly. Taylor has written twelve books on atmospheric and planetary physics.See his comment underneath http://www.theambler.co.uk/2012/03/05/mapping-the-world-and-beyond/ In September 2011, he retired from full-time academia and from the Halley Professorship of Physics.

Early life  Cannon was born in New Orleans, Louisiana and moved to New York City in 1962.  Career  During the civil rights era, he was a member of the Society of Umbra, a collective of Black writers. Cannon taught humanities at Medgar Evers College, helping to integrate the public school system in New York. In 1969 Cannon penned the novel Groove, Bang, and Jive Around, which author Ishmael Reed called the precursor to rap and author Darius James called in the New York Press \\"an underground classic of such legendary stature that New York's black cognoscenti have transformed the work into an urban myth.\\" Cannon, along with Joe Johnson and Ishmael Reed, began an independent publishing house that focused on multicultural literature in the 1970s called Reed, Cannon and Johnson. In 1973 he also collaborated with Reed to interview the first Black sci-fi writer, George S. Schuyler, for Yardbird II, Reed's own publication. Cannon met his friend, artist David Hammons on a park bench in the 1970s. The two collaborated on certain works, including Invisible Paintings, where Hammons traced Cannon's painting collection with pencil and then removed the physical works. Hammons once bottled Cannon's voice speaking poems. Cannon wrote poems about Hammons' work and made public appearances for him. Cannon was a mentor to many writers, including Eileen Myles, Norman Ohler and Paul Beatty. In 2013 he was featured with curator Lydia Y. Nichols in an artist talk about Black bodies and migration for Curator's International. = A Gathering of Tribes = In 1990 Cannon was visiting the Nuyorican Poet's Cafe with Hammons when he was inspired to create A Gathering of the Tribes first as a literary magazine to document the vibrant culture that was happening in the Lower East Side. The first issue was published with less than 1000 copies in 1991 on a Xerox machine. By 1993 Tribes quickly grew into a salon and non-profit multi-cultural interdisciplinary arts organization run from his home in the New York City borough of Manhattan's East Village neighborhood. Cannon wanted it to be a multicultural, multigenerational space for both local and traveling art lovers. The collective also hosted a gallery and performance space where numerous exhibitions and concerts have taken place, supporting and inspiring many notable artists and musicians such as the Sun Ra Arkestra (1995), David Henderson, Chavisa Woods, John Farris, Bob Holman, Ishmael Reed, Billy Bang, Max Blagg and David Hammons. One of Cannon's exhibitions at Tribes Gallery he titled Exquisite Poop was inspired by his own relationship with visual art as a blind person. A painter included in the exhibition would describe a piece to participating writers, who would then describe the painting for a different painter who would in turn paint it. In April 2014 both the organization and Cannon were forced to relocate and the gallery permanently shut when the occupancy agreement they had with the woman to whom the building had previously been sold, Lorraine Zhang, ended. Simultaneously a wall which retained some of an art-piece by David Hammons (which had previously been sold to an art collector after having been reproduced and the originality of the object transferred) was removed and relocated by the organization and replaced by another minus the pedigree adornment. Tribes magazine began publishing online and Cannon published an anthology in hard copy in 2017. Personal life Cannon went completely blind in 1989 from glaucoma. Death and memorials Cannon died on July 7, 2019, from sepsis at an assisted nursing facility in New York City at the age of 84.\\"Poet Steve Cannon, 84, of A Gathering of the Tribes\\", AMNY, 2019-07-08.

Cap., D.D., (24 July 1899 ‚Äì 18 December 1970) was a prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, serving as Bishop of Aga√±a, Guam, from 1945 to 1970.  Biography  = Early life and education = William Baumgartner was born in College Point, Queens, New York City, New York, United States, to William Lawrence Baumgartner and Elizabeth (n√©e Wurtz) Baumgartner. He attended St. Fidelis School, the parochial elementary school of St. Fidelis Parish in College Point, and already had decided to become a Capuchin friar by the time he was to start high school. He boarded at St. Lawrence College in Mount Calvary, Wisconsin, a seminary high school run by Capuchin Franciscans. He later received a Doctor of Divinity. = Priesthood and episcopacy = Baumgartner was ordained a Capuchin priest on 30 May 1926, taking the name Apollinaris, the name of many famous Catholic saints and bishops. On 25 August 1945, Pope Pius XII appointed him Vicar Apostolic of Guam and Titular Bishop of Ioppe. He was consecrated on 18 September 1945, with Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, Titular Archbishop of Laodicea in Phrygia, serving as Consecrator, and Bishop Eugene Joseph McGuinness, Titular Bishop of Ilium, and Bishop Bartholomew Joseph Eustace, Bishop of Camden, serving as Co-Consecrators. He arrived in Guam on 23 October 1945, shortly after the end of the World War II, flying in on the personal plane of Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, who was leading the post-war military administration on the island. The vicariate apostolic was in ruins at that time, with most of Guam's churches damaged beyond repair, all the American missionary priests still held captive in Japan, and only one Chamorro, or native Guamanian, priest remaining, with no Chamorro nuns left. From 1947 to 1949, he also served as Apostolic Administrator of Okinawa and the Southern Islands, Japan, in addition to his work in Guam. = Work in education = Almost immediately after arriving on Guam, Baumgartner set to work reestablishing Catholic schools on the island, all of which had been destroyed in the war. He quickly arranged for nuns to set up houses on the island to staff his schools, while also hiring Chamorro lay teachers. This was a new trend in Catholic education on Guam, where for all of its history, most Catholic school teachers had been foreign-born priests and nuns. The schools were attended mostly by native Guamanian children, but also children of American military personnel. Besides founding schools, he was also active in acquiring scholarships for Chamorro children to Catholic seminaries, colleges, and universities on the mainland United States. Some of the schools he founded are noted in detail as follow:  Father Due√±as Memorial School  On 1 October 1948, Baumgartner established Father Due√±as Memorial School as a seminary high school, named in honor of Father Jesus Baza Due√±as, a Chamorro priest executed by the Japanese during World War II. The Stigmatine Fathers arrived to administer and teach at the school, and 11 men made up the first graduating class in 1950.  Academy of Our Lady of Guam  Baumgartner founded the Academy of Our Lady of Guam on 8 September 1949 as the first all- girls high school on Guam and the second Catholic high school. It was administered by the Sisters of Mercy of Belmont, North Carolina, who provided three nuns, including Sister Mary Inez Underwood, RSM, the first principal.  Santa Barbara Catholic School  Santa Barbara Catholic School opened in September 1950 with grades 1-4 and 150 students. The school was part of Santa Barbara Parish and was run by the Sisters of Mercy.  St. Jude Thaddeus Junior High School & Cathedral Grade School (Bishop Baumgartner Memorial Catholic School)  In 1955, Baumgartner founded St. Jude Thaddeus Junior High School, a K-10 school staffed by six Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration from La Crosse, Wisconsin. Later, the ninth and tenth grades were eliminated, and in the 1980s, the school merged with Cathedral Grade School to form the new Bishop Baumgartner Memorial Catholic School, named in honor of the bishop who founded both of the merging schools. = Later life and death = On 14 October 1965, the Vicariate Apostolic of Guam was raised and renamed the Diocese of Aga√±a, and Apollinaris Baumgartner was appointed its first bishop. He reigned for five more years, before dying on 18 December 1970 in Hag√•t√±a, the seat of the bishop. He advised Father Louis Brouillard to \\"pray\\" after being accused of molesting over 20 boys on the Island of Guam.  Legacy  Baumgartner is best remembered for creating Guam's Catholic education system, founding nearly a dozen schools in just a few years. Today, Bishop Baumgartner Memorial Catholic School, an elementary school created by a merger of two schools he founded, is named in his honor.  Coat of arms  For his episcopal coat of arms, Baumgartner chose a phoenix as the main charge. The bird was chosen because of its mythological ability to be reborn out of ashes, which he believed would be representative of the future of his see on Guam.

It was formed under a climate of controversy around the name of the team, which some consider offensive. According to a letter from Snyder, it \\"will address the urgent challenges plaguing Indian country based on what tribal leaders tell us they need most.\\" In the letter to season ticket holders, announcing the Foundation, Snyder stated that he and other team representatives had visited 26 reservations in twenty states to \\"listen and learn first-hand about the views, attitudes, and experiences of the Tribes\\". The letter quotes Pueblo of Zuni Governor Arlen Quetawki, saying \\"I appreciated your sincerity to learn about our culture and the real life issues we face on a daily basis\\". Torrez-Martinez of Desert Cahuilla was quoted in the letter as saying, \\"There are Native Americans everywhere that 100 percent support the Redskins\\". Snyder also used his letter to cite instances of support for the team name by other Native Americans during his visits. After decades of defending the name, amidst the removal of many names and images as part of the George Floyd protests, and pressure from investors and sponsors, the Redskins began the process of changing their name. On July 23, 2020 the team announced that, given that a rebranding will take 12 to 18 months, they will be called the Washington Football Team with a block \\"W\\" logo for the 2020 season. Background Prior to the official announcement of the foundation, there had been news reports of meetings by Snyder with tribal leaders in Alabama and New Mexico to discuss charitable donations and economic development; which received mixed responses from Native Americans. Some welcome any assistance with poverty and the other problems poverty creates; while others see it as purely public relations. Robert McGhee, treasurer of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians in Atmore, AL said: \\"I thought the whole meeting was odd.\\" On his visit to the A:shiwi A:wan Museum and Heritage Center in New Mexico, Snyder was given a guided tour by the director, Jim Enote. When Enote told Snyder he was not pleased with the Redskins mascot and team name Snyder snapped back with, \\"We are a football team.\\" Gary L. Edwards (Cherokee), the chief executive of the National Native American Law Enforcement Association (NNALEA) was named director of OAF. As CEO of NNALEA, Edwards serves or has served on the following advisory committees and task forces: the National Incident Management System; the National Response Plan; the Funding of First Responders; Preparedness and Information Sharing; Pilot Capabilities Assessment Project; SAFECOM Advisory Group; the Department of Homeland Security's National Preparedness Goal State, Tribal and Local Working Group; as well as the Department of Justice's Counter-Terrorism Training Coordination Working Group, Intelligence Training Coordination Working Group and Officer Safety and Wellness Task Force. The NNALEA was cited in a US Dept. of Interior Inspector General's (IG) report for failing to produce any usable work to fulfill a contract with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, leading to cancellation of that contract. Edwards was not mentioned by name. The IG report was most critical of the BIA for allowing language in the contract that resulted in the NNALEA being paid almost $1 million without requiring results. Reception and criticism NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that he takes the creation of the foundation as an indication that Snyder is \\"doing his due diligence when it comes to listening to the public about the franchise's controversial name, and he continues to stand behind the name due to strong public support.\\" The National Congress of American Indians issued a statement saying it is glad that Snyder is dedicating time and resources to Native American issues. \\"However, this Foundation will only contribute to the problems in Indian Country if it does not also address the very real issue of how Native people are consistently stereotyped, caricatured, and denigrated by mascot imagery and the use of the R-word slur,\\" the statement read. \\"For Mr. Snyder and the Foundation to truly support and partner with Indian Country, they must first change the name of the D.C. team and prove that the creation of this organization isn't just a publicity stunt.\\" In an editorial in the Washington Post, Brian Cladoosby, the president of the NCAI wrote: \\"Snyder, his team and the NFL are welcome to join Indian country as allies and partners but only when they make their most significant contribution up front: Retire the name of this team. Only then will we truly know Snyder's commitment to Indian country, to Native youth and to a future where tribal nations and our people are treated as equal to all other Americans.\\" The initial critical responses to the foundation from some Native American advocates was almost overshadowed in the media by the response to Stephen Colbert's attempt at satire. In response to the foundation, ESPN commentator Keith Olbermann asked why, if \\"Redskin\\" is not insulting, Snyder never uses the term to refer to Native Americans? Senator Harry Reid called the foundation \\"a phony deal\\" and predicted that the name will change within three years. In a letter posted on her website, Congresswoman Betty McCollum (D-Minn.) calls the foundation an \\"attempt to buy the silence of Native Americans with a foundation that is equal parts public relations scheme and tax deduction.\\" In The New York Times, author David Treuer (Ojibwe) places the creation of the foundation in the context of the long history of Native American being given gifts rather than real change that would make a difference. In an editorial Rick Cohen, a former executive director of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy (NCRP) notes that there are signs that any assistance given to Native Americans will be contingent on silence, if not support of the team name by the recipients. Also, the creation of a new foundation, by joining the team name with Native Americans, is an obvious public relations tactic, since both Snyder and the team have existing charitable foundations which could have made contributions to existing Native American organizations. Diana Aviv, president and CEO of Independent Sector, a leadership organization representing nonprofits, foundations and corporate grant makers, criticized the Washington NFL team's Original Americans Foundation stating: \\"Creating a new foundation using the language found in the Washington NFL team's name is offensive not only to Native communities, but to all people of goodwill who believe it is important to treat others with respect and dignity\\". The Joint Affinity Groups and Native Americans in Philanthropy have issued a statement that the OAF's \\"laudable philanthropic goals are undermined by the continued use of a racist slur in the name of the foundation and the franchise that founded it\\", and asks \\"Is it exploitive to offer funds or other financial benefits to under- served tribal communities in exchange for tacit permission to continue using that identifiably racist/stereotypic mascot term?\\" Redskins general manager Bruce Allen responded to the criticism by saying the foundation is not intended to buy support. Funded projects and results For recipients of one of the initial donations, the Lame Deer, Montana public schools on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, there is a range of opinion regarding the name of the Washington team, but the tribe's Economic development administrator Steve Small, said \\"We had to weigh need against principle.\\" The publisher of the reservation newspaper called the foundation \\"...a slick PR move to gain support from poor Native Americans to keep the Redskins mascot. It's cheaper than changing the brand name and commerce associated with the current mascot and logo.\\" Upon learning that the OAF would be the title sponsor of a celebrity golf tournament in Arizona, two of the other sponsors withdrew their participation in protest. First was the National Indian Gaming Association, whose chairman, Ernest Stevens, said his organization finds the NFL team's name to be offensive and is skeptical about the motives of the foundation\\". Next was the Notah Begay III Foundation, its executive director Crystal Echo Hawk stating: \\"I find it underhanded and despicable that the Washington football team would co-opt this event. As soon as we found out about their involvement we withdrew our support.\\" Later, an additional sponsor, the Navajo Nation Gaming Enterprise, stated that they would have declined sponsorship had they known in advance of the Redsk*ns involvement. After the event, the Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly thanked the sponsors and expressed disappointment at those who had withdrawn support. Members of the Fort Yuma Quechan Tribe say they refused a \\"bribe\\" from the Washington Redskins organization, which tribal members say offered a blank check to fund a skatepark in their community. The Quechan Memorial Skatepark is an existing project intended to provide an activity for young people, while serving as a memorial to those lost to suicide. The Chippewa Cree Tribe of Montana accepted money from the foundation to build a playground, leaders stating that they do not care about the controversy. The Zuni Pueblo tribe sent notice to Native artists that representatives of the OAF would be visiting on August 11, 2014 to buy artwork, in particular anything that incorporated the team logo or colors. The director of the Zuni Museum and Heritage Center characterized the event as part of a \\"spin doctoring\\" campaign, and wondered why the purchases would not be made through the existing markets for Zuni artworks. According to a report filed with the IRS, the OAF donated $3.7 million to 20 tribes during 2014, its first year of operation. The amount dropped to 1.6 million in the second year, with no explanation being given. However, the team has spent at least a half a million dollars lobbying Congress regarding the foundation since 2014. Current status It has been noted that there has been no reports of activity by the foundation in the first months of 2015, and references to the OAF have disappeared from the main website of the team. The chairwoman of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah , Gari Pikyavit Lafferty, has been removed from office by a majority vote of the tribal council for accepting personal gifts in exchange for her support of the OAF and the Redskins team name. Lafferty's subsequent appeal of her impeachment has been denied. Phil Gover, a member of the Paiute tribe and one of the petitioners in the case that cancelled the Redskins trademarks, states that the foundation is having a corrupting influence. In August, 2015, the Cheyenne River Sioux Council in South Dakota voted to return a $25,000 check issued to the Cheyenne River Rodeo Association on July 10, and decline any further donations from the Original Americans Foundation. After accepting a $200,000 donation for the prior year, the Indian National Finals Rodeo (INFR), which says it is the U.S.' and Canada's largest rodeo organization for Native Americans, sent a letter refusing any further donations. INFR Vice President Michael Bo Vocu stated \\"After much soul searching, we have decided that we cannot in good conscience accept resources from you on the terms you have offered, no matter how desperately we need it ... because, as you know, the resources you are offering are not truly philanthropic ‚Äì they come with the expectation that we will support the racial slur that continues to promote your associated professional football team's name.\\" Last year the Redskins primary logo appeared at many Native rodeo events, creating a backlash from those offended by it. With the announcement in July, 2020 that the Redskins management is doing a review of the team name, Sports Illustrated investigated the foundation and found that funding was cut back after the resolution of the trademark cases in 2017. In addition, some of the funds that were spent went not to Native Americans, but to schools that also used Redskins as their sport team name, such as St. Johns High School in Arizona and McLoud High School in Oklahoma were Native Americans are only a minority of students, 7% and 13% respectively. In popular culture Comedy Central aired a segment of The Colbert Report that attempted to satirize the establishment of the Washington Redskins Original Americans Foundation by proposing a foundation called the \\"Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever\\". The resulting campaign to \\"CancelColbert\\" by Asian Americans overshadowed the initial response from Native Americans opposed to the Redskins foundation.

It is roughly bounded by the University of Maryland campus, the B&O; Railroad tracks, and US Route 1. The area was platted out in 1889, and built out over the next several decades, its developers seeking to attract commuters to Baltimore and Washington, DC, and individuals affiliated with the Maryland Agricultural College (as the school was then known). Most of the neighborhood is residential, with American Foursquare and Cape style housing predominating. Closer to the university campus, the developers built garden-style apartment houses and other types of housing to cater to the academic community.

The coat of arms of Krasnoyarsk is the heraldic symbol of Krasnoyarsk, Russia. The first version was approved on March 12, 1804. The coat of arms was divided horizontally into two parts, the upper part containing the coat of arms of Tomsk Governorate, and the lower part picturing the Krasny Yar cliff on a silver background. A revised coat of arms, approved on November 23, 1851, had the golden figure of a lion placed on a red heraldic shield with a spade in the right fore paw and a sickle in the left fore paw, both made of the same metal. The shield was topped with the golden crown of the Russian Empire. The current coat of arms (as depicted here) was approved on November 28, 2004. It contains the same red shield as in 1851 but with a slightly changed figure of the lion in the officially approved image. The shield is topped with a form of the mural crown, which is the golden five- tower coronet of rank of a federal subject administrative center. In 2005, a tall pillar with a bronze statue of the Krasnoyarsk heraldic lion upon its top was erected at the Krasnoyarsk Railway Station square.

Holmes is known best for her biblical trilogy which began with the novel Two From Galilee, a love story about Mary and Joseph, published by Fleming H. Revell. Biography Born in 1910 in Storm Lake, Iowa, to tractor salesman Sam Holmes and his wife, Marjorie Holmes began writing as a teenager, selling her first story during the Great Depression before graduating from Cornell College in 1931. She met engineering student Lynn Mighell (pronounced mile), a native of Holstein, at a writers' workshop at the University of Iowa. They married in 1932, living first in McLean then Manassas, Virginia, and had four children, including a daughter named Melanie. In her spare time, Holmes wrote a twice- weekly syndicated family-life column, \\"Love and Laughter,\\" for the Washington Evening Star newspaper from 1959 to 1973 and a monthly column, \\"A Woman's Conversations With God,\\" from 1970 to 1975. She wrote articles in magazines such as Woman's Day, McCall's, Ladies Home Journal, Reader's Digest, Better Homes & Gardens, Today's Health and Daily Guidepost. She also taught university level writing courses. Her first novel, World By the Tail, was published in 1943. She attracted a loyal audience with her commonsense parables and pick-me-ups published in such volumes as \\"Hold Me up a Little Longer, Lord\\" and \\"Secrets of Health, Energy, and Staying Young,\\" an ode to the miraculous properties of nutritional supplements. Two From Galilee trilogy Holmes was inspired to write Two From Galilee after attending a candlelit Christmas Eve church service in 1963, where the nativity scene was reenacted. Sitting beside her thirteen-year-old daughter, near the hay, Holmes felt transported back to \\"the fields and barns\\" of her Iowa childhood. In the introduction of the book, she wrote, \\"For the first time in my life, I realised, 'Why, this really happened!' On this night, a long time ago, there actually was a girl having a baby far from home...in a manger, on the hay...and I thought, astonished: 'When Mary bore the Christ child, she couldn't have been much older than my Melanie here beside me!' With this sudden awareness came a thrilling conviction about Joseph: He must have been a young man too. Old enough to protect and care for Mary and her child, but young enough to be deeply in love with her. And she with him. Why not? They were engaged to be married. Surely a God, who loved us enough to send his precious son into the world, would want that son to be raised in a home where there was love‚Äîgenuine human love between his earthly parents.\\" Holmes spent the next three years researching and writing the story, including traveling to Israel to do research for her novels with the help of Dr. Roy Blizzard, who spoke fluent Hebrew and worked on archaeological excavations throughout Israel. For six years, she took the manuscript from publisher to publisher, only to be told, \\"You've made the Holy Family as real as the people next door! You can't do that.\\" That, however, was precisely what Holmes had intended to do. Eventually, the book was published in 1972, nine years after that Christmas Eve church service. The book was published simultaneously in the United States and Canada. It has never been out of print since Bantam books has published it as well as the sequels Three From Galilee and The Messiah. =Reviews = The trilogy about the Holy Family did receive some criticism, due in part to things in the novels which contradict things in the New Testament of the Holy Bible. For example: * In Two From Galilee, Mary's mother Hannah is described as the stereotypical Jewish mother and Joseph's father Jacob dies from alcoholism. This is unbiblical and such insinuations could be considered disrespectful. * In Three From Galilee, 13-year-old John the Baptist urges his 12-year-old cousin, Jesus, to come worship God with wine and song and outeat all the others. This contradicts the Bible, which states John never drank wine Luke 1:11-17 and often fasted.Matthew 9:14-17Luke 5:33-39 * Also in Three From Galilee, 29-year-old Jesus falls in love with a 17-year-old Am-ha-aretz girl named Tamara, with whom he becomes enthralled after seeing her bathe in a waterfall. The similarity to the story of King David and Bathsheba is unmistakable.2 Samuel 11:1-3 The fictitious Mary Sue character, Tamara, is underage and causes Jesus to neglect his sheep. This \\"relationship\\" would also make him unfaithful to his bride, the church.2 Samuel 12:1-4The Church's One Foundation * Also in Three From Galilee, both John and Mary have to tell Jesus he is the Messiah and what he must do. The Bible says Jesus knew at age 12 without being told and told his parents.Luke 2:41-51 * In The Messiah, some of the disciples are described as having blond hair and blue eyes, unlikely for Middle Eastern Jewish men. See also: race and appearance of Jesus. Holmes stated in an author's note at the beginning of Three From Galilee, \\"I do not pretend to claim this is the way things actually happened; only that, given the facts of Jesus' life and times as we know them, this is the way they could have happened.\\" =Musical= Two From Galilee was made into a musical created and written by Robert Sterling and Karla Worley. Personal life Holmes' husband Lynn Mighell rose eventually to become a top executive with the Carrier Corporation. He died of cancer in 1979 after years of illness. During the period of her grieving, Holmes wrote the book To Help You Through the Hurting. In 1981, when she was 70, Holmes met physician George Schmieler. Both had lost their mates after nearly 50 years of marriage. Schmieler, grieving the loss of his wife six months earlier, had discovered a book his wife had been reading, I've Got to Talk to Somebody, God by Marjorie Holmes. Six weeks later he traced Holmes through relatives, called her unlisted phone number and announced, \\"I love you. You saved my life.\\" She agreed to meet him and, nineteen weeks after they met, Holmes and Schmieler were married. Writer Marjorie Holmes Celebrates a Marriage Made in Heaven and Set to Words and Music in Pittsburgh They moved to Pittsburgh, where they lived until his death in 1992. Holmes dedicated books to him, including Three From Galilee. She also wrote the book Second Wife, Second Life specifically about him. Holmes returned to the area of Washington D.C. to live after his death. Holmes died March 13, 2002 at a nursing home in Manassas after suffering a series of strokes. She is survived by three children, a sister, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.

For the last 50 years, it is home to some 2,800 families of magicians, snake charmers, acrobats, singers, dancers, actors, traditional healers and musicians and especially puppeteers or kathputli-performers from Rajasthan. This makes it world‚Äôs largest community of street performers. The colony is undergoing an in situ redevelopment plan by Delhi Development Authority (DDA) of Government of Delhi. Etymology The name Kathputli Colony comes from Hindi language word for puppet, Kathputli. History The colony started in the 1950s, as a cluster of makeshift tents in an open field on the outskirts of Delhi, set up by itinerant puppeteers from Rajasthan, which gave the colony its name. In the coming decades street performers of Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra also moved in. Today, it is prime real estate area surrounded by Mayapuri and Naraina. Redevelopment plan In 2010, Government of Delhi initiated the redevelopment project of the colony on a public-private partnership basis. The contract was granted to Raheja Developers. As per the plan, 2800 flats will be built in 10-story buildings on the 5.2 hectares, apart from that a portion of the land will be given to the developer to construct its own commercial and residential buildings. Amid protests by residents and controversy, in early 2014, ahead of the 1 April 2014 deadline, some of the 2,754 families started shifting to transit camps built at Anand Parbat area 2 km away by the developer Rahejas. They are expected to stay here for the next two years, while the site undergoes construction. https://thewire.in/government/delhi- kathputli-colony-demolition  References  Bibliography *  External links  * Kathputli Colony, DDA Rehabilitation website * Kathputli Colony, photo documentary of the slum of Delhi artists * Category:Puppetry in India Category:Street performance Category:Neighbourhoods in Delhi Category:West Delhi district Category:Culture of Delhi ","title":"Kathputli Colony"},{"id":"42361114","text":"Chinese Internet slang is informal Chinese language coined to express ideas on the Chinese Internet in response to events, the influence of the mass media and foreign culture, and the desires of users to simplify and update the Chinese language.

Mizumura's family meanwhile enters a period of decline after her father is demoted and her mother leaves him for another man. She and her sister squander their education and youth. Later, Mizumura manages to begin a career for herself as an academic and begins writing novels. She returns to America occasionally where she catches up with old friends and learns of Azuma's rise to success. One year she returns and discovers that he has disappeared and no one has heard anything of him. In 1998 while teaching at Stanford University, Mizumura is approached by a young man, Yusuke Kato, who tells her that he met Azuma a few years before he disappeared in Karuizawa, Nagano where he mentioned he knew the novelist Minae Mizumura. Yusuke and Mizumura spend the night discussing Azuma and Mizumura, who had been struggling with her third novel, decides that Azuma's story would make a perfect novel. She explains to the reader that while she had originally intended to write an \\"I Novel\\", her work is a \\"True Novel\\", i.e. a novel that is pure fiction. =Volume I= Yusuke Kato is persuaded by a wealthy friend to spend time with him in his vacation cottage in Karuizawa. While traveling through Oiwake at night he has a bicycle accident in front of an old run-down house. The house is owned by an unfriendly middle-aged man, Taro Azuma, but Kato is persuaded to stay the night by the maid of the house, Fumiko Tsuchiya. The following day he encounters Fumiko again and is taken to the house of three snobbish elderly sisters, Harue, Natsue and Fuyue. The sisters are there to scatter the ashes of Yoko, Natsue's daughter. They hint at their relationship to Taro who they dismiss as the relation of one of the sister's rickshaw drivers. Afterwards, Fumiko invites him back to Taro's house in order to tell him about Taro and his relationship to the sisters. Fumiko begins the story by telling how she was born in 1937 to poor farmers in Saku, Nagano. Her early memories are of the extreme poverty suffered during World War II. As a teenager, she moved to Tokyo with her uncle Genji \\"George\\" who secured her a position as a maid on an American army base. When Fumiko was 17 he contacted wealthy acquaintances in order to try to find her work as a maid in a private household. She was eventually sent to work as a maid and nanny for Natsue and her two young daughters Yuko and Yoko. Natsue is the middle daughter of the Saegusa family, a snobbish clan descended from wealthy landowners. The family is close to the Shigemitsu family who, despite being financially poorer, are descended from nobility. The two families share adjoining plots of land in Tokyo as well as in Karuizawa where they both vacation. The families celebrate Western ideals over Japanese ones with each family having spent significant time in Europe. Each Saegusa sister had once held aspirations of marrying into the Shigemitsu family but the only son, Noriyuki, died during the war. Fumiko spends her time taking care of Yoko, Natsue's youngest child, who doesn't fit in with the rest of her Saegusa and Shugemitsu members of her generation and who is kept close to home. Shortly after Yoko begins to attend school Roku, an old servant of Yoko's grandfather, invites his nephew and his family to stay with him. The youngest of the nephew's children is Taro. Taro is routinely abused by his family and Fumiko later learns that he is actually the illegitimate child of one of Roku's nieces and was raised by his uncle after his mother died. When local children begin to bully him Yoko joins in, only to be discouraged from doing so by her father. She eventually shows him small kindnesses and he becomes enraptured by her. At the same time Fumiko and Yoko's step-grandmother Mrs. Utagawa conspire to have him work in the Utagawa household so as to spare him the abuse from his aunt. =Volume II= Yoko and Taro grow increasingly close throughout the years, encouraged by Mrs. Utagawa, who hides their relationship from Yoko's parents. The only time they spend apart is her vacation months in Karuizawa. Mrs. Utagawa eventually persuades her step-son to build her a villa in Oiwake. She takes Taro with her to help around the house, however he is hurt when he visits Yoko in Karuizawa and the Saegusas and Shigemitsus treat him as a handyman. Eventually Mrs. Utagawa dies. Her final wish being that her step-son provide enough money for Taro to go to high school. The family complies with her wishes, however shortly after Yoko's father transfers to a university in Sapporo. Yoko and Taro stay in sporadic contact throughout the years, aided by Fumiko. When Yoko is eighteen she contacts Taro again and she and Fumiko are surprised to discover that his adoptive family used the money meant for his education as a down payment for a small business. When they finally meet, chaperoned by Fumiko, Yoko is humiliated by Taro‚Äôs sullen behaviour but arranges a more clandestine meeting with him. After a few days she is discovered naked in the summer home in Oiwake, sick with pneumonia. Yoko's family is humiliated, believing that Taro and Yoko had sex; Yoko later reveals to Fumiko that Taro refused to have sex with her after she told him she would never marry him. Taro runs away from his adoptive parents to live with Fumiko. He drinks heavily and gives up his plans for education instead focusing his sights on moving to America. Fumiko's uncle Genji helps to secure him a position as a chauffeur in New York City and Taro leaves, disappearing for fifteen years. After seven years Yoko marries Masayuki, the only son in the Shigetmitsu family, finally fulfilling the desire of the Shigemitsus and Saegusas to unite through marriage. Taro eventually comes back into Fumiko and Yoko‚Äôs lives when he anonymously buys the old Oiwake villa and enlists Fumiko to renovate it. Spending a week there on vacation he is hesitant to contact Yoko, but Fumiko intervenes and the two are briefly reunited. Their first meeting is interrupted by a weeping Masayuki. Yoko pledges to stay married to him. After her second husband dies Fumiko is persuaded by Taro to work for him in Tokyo and, in her late forties, eventually becomes the career woman she longed to be. Yoko and Taro become lovers with Masayuki‚Äôs blessing. Their unconventional relationship works for seven years until the Saegusa sisters stumble upon Taro and Yoko in public. Hatsue confronts Masayuki who in turn fights with Yoko to the point where he says he no longer wishes to be married to her. Unable to bear the thought of her husband leaving her, Yoko runs away. She is eventually found days later in one of the Karuizawa homes that Fumiko failed to search properly. She develops pneumonia and dies although not before forcing Taro to promise her that he will not kill himself before Masayuki dies. A few years later Masayuki develops cancer and dies and he and Yoko's remains are meant to be scattered around the Karuizawa which is why Fumiko is there in the present. As Fumiko's story ends Fuyue arrives at the Oiwake villa and informs Fumiko that now that both Yoko and Masayuki are dead Taro is leaving her with both the Oiwake and Karuizawa homes. Fuyue then drives Yusuke home, but not before revealing that during the period where Taro lived with Fumiko in Tokyo the two became lovers. Before his vacation ends Yusuke returns to the Oiwake villa in secret where he watches Fumiko and Taro scatter Yoko and Masayuki's ashes.

The album, the first of a trilogy that Oxley recorded for major labels, has enjoyed legendary status for years as an avant-garde classic. Background Oxley won the Melody Maker Readers Jazz Poll this year and was more or less permanent drummer at London's Ronnie Scott Club in an accompanying role. But his music, as presented on this record, had not been heard. The album features an all-star lineup of British avant jazz carefully chosen with trumpeter Kenny Wheeler, saxophonist Evan Parker, guitarist Derek Bailey and bassist Jeff Clyne. Music The opener, \\"Crossing\\", was written by Oxley in 1964, when he was still living in his native Yorkshire studying and teaching. \\"Stone Garden\\" is an arrangement of a tune Oxley culled from his experience of accompanying its composer, altoist Charlie Mariano, at the Ronnie Scott club.

Founded in 1994 by Andrew Phong Vo, Texas Iron Spikes was established to serve the University and Central Texas region through active philanthropy. The Texas Iron Spikes also serve as the official spirit organization for the University of Texas baseball team.  History  In January 1994, Vo envisioned creating a multi-faceted service organization that would benefit the university and surrounding communities while, at the same time, providing its members the opportunity to develop lifetime, fraternal bonds through spirit, social, and intramural activities. In April 1994, after obtaining approval by the University of Texas administrators and securing support from legendary UT baseball coach, Cliff Gustafson, Vo recruited 16 other students to officially create a premier organization that embodied a common vision while allowing its members to maintain their individual values, personal integrity, and academic goals. In its first year of existence, the Texas Iron Spikes focused on supporting two key organizations: Special Olympics Texas and Neighborhood Longhorns. With Special Olympics Texas, the Texas Iron Spikes participated in a variety of hands-on interactive events with the Area 13 Special Olympians to support the athletes. The Iron Spikes also began a series of monthly group panhandling efforts across Austin to raise funds for this non-profit organization - a tradition that still remains strong to this day. Partnering with Neighborhood Longhorns, the Texas Iron Spikes focused on tutoring academics and coaching sports to low-income elementary school students on a weekly basis throughout the school year and quickly became the first student group to serve as ambassadors for the UT-sponsored program. In both 1994 and 1995, the University of Texas recognized the Texas Iron Spikes with the Outstanding Group Service to the Community Award. To complement their focus on volunteerism, the Texas Iron Spikes quickly gained recognition as the first and only official men‚Äôs spirit group for the University of Texas baseball team. Vo felt that the Texas Iron Spikes' commitment to both community service and promotion of UT spirit would attract well-rounded student leaders to the organization by giving them a forum to demonstrate their passion to give back to others while also allowing them to enjoy their love for baseball, America‚Äôs favorite pastime, which has proved time and again that it has the power to bring people together. As a result of the strong foundation established by the Spring 1994 founding class and through the continued commitment to the core values by its early leaders, in the less than five years of the existence, the Texas Iron Spikes were recognized by the University of Texas as the Most Outstanding Service Organization (1998) and Best Overall Organization (1999). Texas Iron Spikes is an organization that selects well-rounded students at the University of Texas from a variety of backgrounds and helps develop them into rising leaders within the community. Since 1994, these individuals have demonstrated commitment to the values expressed in the Texas Iron Spikes vision and creed, and strive to live by these values daily. As a result of their active involvement in Spikes, past members have been invited to become members of other honorary organizations on campus and have also received prestigious awards from the university and surrounding communities. Throughout the short history of the Texas Iron Spikes, strong leaders have emerged to leave their lasting legacy on campus as both students and alumni.  Service  Texas Iron Spikes are serious about their responsibility to the University and Austin community. As a result, the Spikes take great pride in being recognized as one of the premier service organizations on campus. Individual members take pride in the quality of each service hour they perform. Each member is expected to complete a minimum number of hours per semester, but most do substantially more than their requirement each semester.

This article presents examples of technologies that have been hypothesized or proposed, but that have not been developed yet.  Artificial general intelligence  Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a hypothetical artificial intelligence that demonstrates a human-like ability to learn. AGI is a machine which could do all human activities with the efficiency of a machine. It is a primary goal of artificial intelligence research and a common topic among science fiction writers and futurists. Artificial general intelligence is also referred to as strong AI, or see Advanced Human Intelligence where he defines strong AI as \\"machine intelligence with the full range of human intelligence.\\" full AI or one that has the ability to perform \\"general intelligent action\\".. This the term they use for \\"human-level\\" intelligence in the physical symbol system hypothesis. AGI is associated with traits such as consciousness, sentience, sapience, and self-awareness, which are observed in living beings. Some examples of hypothetical technology are flying cars, jetpacks, teleportation or robot helpers.  Mind uploading  Whole brain emulation (WBE) or mind uploading (sometimes called mind copying or mind transfer) is the hypothetical process of copying mental content (including long-term memory and \\"self\\") from a particular brain substrate and copying it to a computational or storage device, such as a digital, analog, quantum-based, or software-based artificial neural network. The computational device could then run a simulation model of the brain information processing, such that it responds in essentially the same way as the original brain (i.e., indistinguishable from the brain for all relevant purposes) and experiences having a conscious mind.A framework for approaches to transfer of a mind's substrateCOALESCING MINDS: BRAIN UPLOADING- RELATED GROUP MIND SCENARIOS Mind uploading may potentially be accomplished by at least two methods: Copy-and-Transfer or Gradual Replacement of neurons. In the former method, mind uploading would be achieved by scanning and mapping the salient features of a biological brain, and then by copying, transferring and storing that information state into a computer system or another computational device.NON-DESTRUCTIVE WHOLE-BRAIN MONITORING USING NANOROBOTS: NEURAL ELECTRICAL DATA RATE REQUIREMENTS The simulated mind could be within a virtual reality or simulated world, supported by an anatomic 3D body simulation model. Alternatively, the simulated mind could reside in a computer that's inside (or connected to) a humanoid robot or a biological body.  Space flight  There are many forms of spaceflight that have been proposed that have not, so far, been developed but are thought to be possible. Some, like the space elevator are under active development.Gaia Staff, \\"Japan's space elevator expected to be built by 2050\\", gaia.com, 29 January 2018 (archive). Others, like Project Orion, a nuclear bomb propulsion system, are entirely paper exercises. As it happens, Orion is thought to be entirely achievable (the obstacles to it are environmental and political rather than technological),George Dyson, Project Orion: The True Story of the Atomic Spaceship, Henry Holt and Company, 2003 . whereas the space elevator depends on the development of a material for the cable with a very high specific strength.Nicola Pugno, \\"A review of the design of superstrong carbon nanotube or graphene fibers and composites\\", ch. 18 in, Mark Schulz, Vesselin Shanov, Zhangzhang Yin (eds), Nanotube Superfiber Materials, William Andrew (Elsevier), 2013 . = Space elevator = A space elevator is a proposed type of space transport system. Its main component is a ribbon-like cable (also called a tether) starting at or near a planetary surface and extending into space. It is designed to permit vehicle transport along the cable directly into space or orbit without the use of large rockets. An Earth-based space elevator would consist of a cable with one end attached to the surface near the equator and the other end in space beyond geostationary orbit (35,800 km altitude). The competing forces of gravity, which are stronger at the lower end, and the outward/upward centrifugal force, which is stronger at the upper end, would result in the cable staying up under tension, and stationary over a single position on Earth. Once deployed, the tether would be ascended repeatedly by mechanical means to orbit, and descended to return to the surface from orbit.Edwards, Bradley Carl. The NIAC Space Elevator Program. NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts On Earth, with its relatively strong gravity, current technology is not capable of manufacturing tether materials that are sufficiently strong and light enough to build a space elevator. However, recent concepts for a space elevator are notable for their plans to use carbon nanotube or boron nitride nanotube-based materials as the tensile element in the tether design. = Rotating skyhook = The rotating skyhook, or momentum-exchange tether, is an idea related to the space elevator concept. It is one of the many proposed applications of space tethers, which include some propulsion systems. The tether is rotated from a heavy orbiting vehicle such that the far end, weighted with a docking station, periodically enters Earth's atmosphere. With the right timing, a fast aircraft can transfer cargo and passengers during the brief time the skyhook is at the bottom of its cycle and stationary relative to Earth's surface. = Light sail = A light sail is a proposed propulsion system that uses the momentum transferred to a sail by light impinging on it. A light sail could use sunlight to achieve interplanetary travel without carrying large quantities of onboard fuel. Just as a sailboat on Earth can tack into the wind, the light sail can be tacked against the direction of light for a return journey from the outer planets.Colin R.

It bears evidence of almost continuous human occupation, starting at least 16,000 years ago‚Äîmaking it one of the few archaeological sites in the Americas at which compelling evidence has been found for human occupation dating to before the appearance of the Clovis culture. Part of the Gault site; the tent covers the 2007‚Äì2014 excavation. Significance Probably the major issue troubling American archaeology over the last several decades has been establishing when the first humans arrived in the western hemisphere. For nearly half a century the large majority of working archaeologists adhered to the notion that people making and using the distinctive Clovis \\"point\\" and its associated lithic technology were the first to arrive about 13,500 calendar years ago and to have spread quickly throughout the Americas. However, there was always a small archaeological minority who contended that the first Americans (in the broadest, two-continent, sense) had been here long before Clovis times on both the east and west margins of both continents. In the last several decades, with the location, investigation, and reporting of a growing number of sites with reliable dating, more and more American archaeologists now believe the western hemisphere was occupied at least several thousand years prior to the appearance of diagnostic Clovis materials. Most of these sites are widely spaced geographically and do not contain an extensive array of associated lithic materials that would show a diagnostic pattern of tool production and use. An attempt to define the characteristics of these older technologies can best be accomplished by investigating sites which are both well-stratified, containing both the older and Clovis materials‚Äîin order to compare technologies in use in the same location under similar conditions‚Äîand show evidence of extended periods of occupation where a wide range of activities took place employing the whole array of lithic tools. The Gault site contains strata which date to prior to the appearance of Clovis (more than 13,500 years B.P.) and to Clovis (13,500 to 13,000 years B.P.), as well as the entire subsequent occupational sequence of the Central Texas region, from late Paleoindian (13,000 to 9,000 years ago) to Archaic (9,000 to 1200 years B.P.), and finally to Late Prehistoric (1200 to 500 years B.P.). A reason for this intensive and almost continuous occupation appears to be the site's location adjacent to two different but resource-rich ecosystems (the uplands of the Edwards Plateau and the lower Blackland Prairie) where water from Buttermilk Creek was available even in drought years, and where a wide variety of local food resources was concentrated. Another is that Gault was also a quarry site, where good quality Edwards chert toolstone (the Edwards Plateau is geologically one of the largest chert bearing formations in North America) was readily available, weathering out of the banks of both modern and ancient watercourses; chert from the Edwards Plateau has been identified as being used for toolmaking as far away as the Lindenmeier site in Colorado. Additionally, the Clovis presence at the Gault site occurs in unprecedented abundance. A preliminary count of Clovis artifacts at the site numbers around 650,000 (including flakes, cores and formal tools), suggesting that a large number of people aggregated at the site and/or people resided at the site for an extended period of time. This evidence calls into question the traditional view of Clovis groups as highly mobile, dedicated big game hunters. Additionally, faunal material from the Gault site includes an array of large, medium-sized and small game such as mammoth, bison, horse, deer, rabbit, birds, and turtles, suggesting a generalized diet. One of the most significant finds at the Gault site is that it is one of only twenty mammoth kill sites in the United States. The national significance of the Gault site was recognized on May 29, 2018, by its official listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The site is also registered as a Texas State Antiquities Landmark. History Henry Gault, from whom the site takes its name, put together a 250-acre farm in the Buttermilk Creek Valley, starting in 1904. At some point in the early 20th century he found extra income as an informant for early archaeological explorations in Central Texas working with the first professional archaeologist in Texas, J.E. Pearce, as well as avocational archaeologists (Alex Dienst, Kenneth Aynesworth and others). The first excavations were carried out at the Gault site in 1929, by Professor J. E. Pearce of the University of Texas. He was attracted by the large size and prolific artifact content of the Archaic midden at Gault. Letters in the Pearce archives contain reference to extensive looting at the Gault site in 1929, and this continued (it was actually a \\"pay-to-dig\\" site for many years) until 1998, when new owners stopped the practice. Fortunately, the looters and collectors apparently rarely dug into the earlier deposits below the Archaic midden due to the lower density of collectible or marketable artifacts. Limited test excavations were conducted in 1991, and sustained geoarchaeological investigations began in 1998, and continued through 2002, and from 2007 to 2015, under the auspices of the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin, the Gault School of Archaeological Research (GSAR) and the Prehistory Research Project at Texas State University . In 2007, the site was purchased and donated to The Archaeological Conservancy . Currently a majority of the site is managed and administered by the GSAR on behalf of the Conservancy and tours and educational opportunities are available. Excavations Gault site: the 2007‚Äì2014 excavation at bedrock. Excavations have been conducted in 15 areas, augmented by numerous machine-dug trenches and boreholes as well as the use of non-invasive geophysical procedures. The work in 1998‚Äì2002 focused on relatively undisturbed, early deposits beneath the looted midden. A sequence of cultural materials from early Paleoindian to early Archaic times was documented, including the technology styles identified as Clovis, Folsom, Wilson, St. Mary's Hall, Cody, Golondrina, Barber, Angostura, Hoxie, and Gower. Clovis was by far the most abundantly represented of these manifestations. Of the 11 cultures possible to find represented on archaeological sites in central Texas, the Gault site has samples of all 11. Excavations in 2007‚Äì2014 in Area 15 of the Gault Site specifically targeted an occupation predating Clovis, evidence of which had been seen in two test units dug in 2002 and 2007. The excavation of a large block of Area 15 () penetrated from the surface to bedrock through culture-bearing alluvial fill eventually exposing at bedrock. Unexpectedly, part of this area had escaped the looting and collecting and had intact archaeology just below the surface. Physical and cultural stratigraphic evidence as well as luminescence dating are consistent in showing a coherent sequence of lithic material evidencing this older occupation followed by Clovis, Late PaleoIndian, Early Archaic, and Middle/Late Archaic occupations over an apparent span of more than 16,000 calendar years. Tools numbering in the thousands were removed from the site before professional excavations began, however a large quantity of tools and debitage remained. Currently, the number recovered is estimated at ca. 2.6 million from 3% of the site. This includes artifacts from all the main cultural periods in Central Texas with the largest quantities belonging to the Clovis-age (more than 600,000 artifacts) and a significant number (150,000 - \\"The Gault Assemblage\\") of artifacts from the intact older strata. The findings from this part of the excavation are described more fully in \\"Evidence of an early projectile point technology in North America at the Gault Site, Texas, USA.\\" A pavement of at least Clovis age with surrounding debris may represent early evidence of a structure or dwelling. More than 100 incised stones and one engraved bone have been recovered and the oldest, dating from the Clovis period, may represent the earliest portable art from a secure context in North America.

A specialist in the Italian repertoire, he was frequently heard in the bel canto operas of Bellini, Donizetti, and Rossini, and in the verismo operas of Leoncavallo, Mascagni, and Puccini. He was notably the first singer to make a complete recording of the role of Rodolfo in Puccini's La boheme in 1917. He also recorded duets from La traviata with Maria Galvany and one duet from Massenet's Manon with Riccardo Tegani with the Gramophone Company. Life and career Born in Florence, Andreini studied at the Conservatorio Luigi Cherubini in his native city. He made his debut at the Teatro Nicolini in Florence in 1902 as Arturo to Luisa Tetrazzini's Elvira in Vincenzo Bellini's I puritani. Later that year he portrayed Elvino in Bellini's La sonnambula at the Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi in Trieste. In 1903 he sang the title role in Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann at the Teatro del Corso in Bologna, and appeared in roles at the Teatro Petruzzelli in Bari. In 1904 Andreini was committed to the Teatro Massimo in Palermo where he notably portrayed Turiddu opposite Eugenia Burzio's Santuzza and Pasquale Amato's Alfio in a lauded production of Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. Other roles he sang at Palermo that year included Edgardo in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor and Almaviva in Rossini's The Barber of Seville. In 1905 he sang Hoffmann for his debut at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome and in 1906 he toured Russia where he was seen as the Duke of Mantua in Giuseppe Verdi's Rigoletto at both the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg and the Solodovnikov Theatre in Moscow. In 1907 Andreini returned to Italy to join the roster of artists at the Politaema Parma where he made his debut as Canio in Ruggero Leoncavallo's Pagliacci. This was followed by performances of Milio Dufresne in Leoncavallo's Zaz√† and Donizetti's Edgardo di Ravenswood later that year. Andreini later sang Milio for his debut at the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples in 1910. He was also seen at the Teatro del Giglio in Lucca in 1910 as Chevalier des Grieux in Giacomo Puccini's Manon Lescaut. In 1911 Andreini was committed to the Teatro Regio in Turin where he made his debut as Walter in Alfredo Catalani's Loreley. In Turin he also created the role of Luciano in the world premiere of Raffaele De Miero's Morgana on February 16, 1911. In 1915 he returned to Palermo to sing Cavaradossi in Puccini's Tosca. In 1916 he was committed to the Havana Opera in Cuba where he performed Alfredo in La traviata to Amelita Galli-Curci's Violetta for his debut with the company. He also was Galli-Curci's partner in productions of Lucia di Lammermoor and in La Sonnambula in Havana that year. In 1917 Andreini returned to Italy to once again join the roster of singers at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. Roles he sang in Rome over the next two seasons included Dick Johnson in Puccini‚Äôs La fanciulla del West, Don Jos√© in Bizet's Carmen, and Pinkerton in Puccini's Madama Butterfly. That same year he became the first person to record the role of Rodolfo in La boheme, singing the role on disc with the Orchestra and Chorus of La Scala under conductor Carlo Sabajno.March et al.

In 1805 James, at the age of 24, built and launched his first small ship, a 59-ton schooner named Thistle. The ship that Moran is best known for is Waterloo, a 392-ton ship built in 1815. It was the first three-masted square- rigged ship built in the Bay of Fundy. In order for a shipbuilding family to function the support of a wife was needed. James built ships and operated a shipyard for over four decades. During his life span he produced at least 20 ships, with the firsts being on the smaller end of tonnage. Between 1840 and the late 1850s James was one of the leading shipbuilders in the Fundy area. In 1856 his son James H. took over the shipyard which later expanded to Saint John, New Brunswick.

The ministry was formed by Presidential decree of Vladimir Putin, who appointed the economist Oleg Savelyev as the federal minister with responsibility for the economic and social development of the region. Background On 11 March 2014, during the Crimean crisis, the Crimean parliament and the Sevastopol City Council issued a letter of intent to unilaterally declare independence from Ukraine. The document specifically mentioned Kosovo as a precedent in the lead part. The declaration was made in an attempt to legitimize a referendum on the status of Crimea where citizens were to vote on whether Crimea should apply to join Russia as a federal subject of the Russian Federation, or remain part of Ukraine. On 16 March 2014, a large majority (reported as 96.77% of those 81.36% of the population of Crimea who voted) voted in favour of independence of Crimea from Ukraine and joining Russia as a federal subject. After the referendum, Crimean lawmakers formally voted both to secede from Ukraine and ask for membership in the Russian Federation. The Sevastopol City Council, however, requested the port's separate admission as a federal city. On 18 March 2014, the self-proclaimed independent Republic of Crimea signed a treaty of accession to the Russian Federation. The accession was granted but separately for each the former regions that composed it: one accession for the Autonomous Republic of Crimea as a federal subject, and another accession for Sevastopol as a federal city. The newly formed federal subject comprising the former Autonomous Republic of Crimea now bears the name Republic of Crimea ‚Äî the same name as the short-lived, self-proclaimed independent republic. During the transition period, which lasted until January 1, 2015, both sides resolved the issues of integration of the new subjects \\"in the economic, financial, credit and legal system of the Russian Federation\\".

He was the proprietor of the Chico Iron Foundry.  Early life and family  He was born in Germany on April 4, 1851, the son of Jacob Mery. His family emigrated to the United States in 1854, when he was three years old. The family made it as far west as Toledo, Ohio, where Jacob had begun to establish a residence, but died only three months after arriving, and his wife died a week later. The family with seven sons, and one daughter, with Michael as the youngest were orphaned. In 1865 Mery went to Detroit, and learned to be a machinist. After four years in Detroit, he traveled through the Mississippi Valley, including to Louisville, Kentucky, New Albany, Indiana. He landed engineering jobs in New Orleans, and Rockport, Texas. In the spring of 1870, he returned to St. Louis and worked constructing city water works. From there he went to Cairo, Illinois, where he worked in an iron foundry. He also worked for a while as a machinist in Houston, Texas, and then returned to New Orleans, to enter the machine shops of the New Orleans and Jackson Railway. This prompted a return to St. Louis in 1871. He went to East St. Louis, Illinois to supervise the Ohio and Mississippi machine shop. It was from there he emigrated to California.  Life in California  Upon arriving in California in 1872, he was immediately hired by the Marysville Foundry, in Marysville, to supervise their expanding operation. The next year, he went to Lake Tahoe, where he was an engineer on steamboat Emerald. Mery was married March 14, 1874, to Sarah Seaward, a native of New York, who grew up in Marysville. He came to Chico on January 10, 1875, and with his brother-in-law, J.O. Rusby as his partner, founded the Chico Iron Works under the business name of Rusby & Mery. It was the first iron foundry in Butte County. The business grew and in January 1882, he bought out his partner, but only a month later, the business was destroyed by fire. Although he carried little insurance, he recovered quickly, and rebuilt a larger foundry and machine-shop where he did repair work, and made store fronts, barley crushers, steam engines, threshers and traction engines. He did almost all of the iron work to be done in Northern California at the time, including work for the ten saw mills which became the Sierra Lumber Company, and he continued to serve the mills after they were absorbed by the Diamond Match Company. He was also the inventor of the Mery double-acting gas engine, which was awarded first prize at the California State Fair. In addition, he also built his own automobile. Eventually, he also purchased a ranch where he planted French prunes, Bartlett pears. He was active in the political affairs of Butte County, and was for some time chairman of the Butte County Republican Central Committee. He held the office of city trustee for six years; and was chairman of the board from 1888 to 1889 and from 1890 to 1891. In 1900, Mery took a trip to Nome, Alaska, when there was placer mining on the beach at that town. He took four plants with him, one being a self-propelling dredger that could go up the stream. All this was packed with definite directions as to where it was to be unloaded; but the crew disobeyed orders and went on to the mouth of the Yukon River with the machinery in the hold. At length the entire consignment was landed; but when it was set up and put in operation, it developed that too much of the earth and gravel would have to be disposed of, and that the yield of gold was not enough to make it pay.

Detail of a Kore's dress 14th-century military martyr wears four layers, all patterned and richly trimmed: a cloak with tablion tunic Greek dress refers to the clothing of the Greek people and citizens of Greece from the antiquity to the modern times. Ancient period Clothing in ancient Greece primarily consisted of the chiton, peplos, himation, and chlamys. While no clothes have survived from this period, descriptions exist in contemporary accounts and artistic depictions. Clothes were mainly homemade, and often served many purposes (such as bedding). Despite popular imagination and media depictions of all-white clothing, elaborate design and bright colors were favored.Ancient Greek Dress Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000-2013. Retrieved 7 October 2013. Ancient Greek clothing consisted of lengths of linen or wool fabric, which generally was rectangular. Clothes were secured with ornamental clasps or pins (, per√≥nƒì; cf. fibula), and a belt, sash, or girdle (zone) might secure the waist. Men's robes went down to their knees, whereas women's went down to their ankles. Byzantine period The Byzantine dress changed considerably over the thousand years of the Empire, but was essentially conservative. The Byzantines liked colour and pattern, and made and exported very richly patterned cloth, especially Byzantine silk, woven and embroidered for the upper classes, and resist-dyed and printed for the lower. A different border or trimming round the edges was very common, and many single stripes down the body or around the upper arm are seen, often denoting class or rank. Taste for the middle and upper classes followed the latest fashions at the Imperial Court. As for the colour, purple and tyrian purple (porphyra) was reserved for the imperial dynasties; other colours in various contexts conveyed information as to class and clerical or government rank. Lower-class people wore simple tunics but still had the preference for bright colours found in all Byzantine fashions. The Byzantine love for colour had its sinister side. The races in the Hippodrome used four teams: red, white, blue and green; and the supporters of these became political factions, taking sides on the great theological issues. Ottoman period Greek merchant (16th century) by Cesare Vecellio Inside the Ottoman empire, Greeks were part of the Rum Millet. The administrators occasionally brought about legal regulations on clothes (see sumptuary laws). The clothing of Muslims, Christians, Jewish communities, clergy, tradesmen state and military officials were strictly regulated during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent. Political crises of the 17th century were reflected as chaos in clothes. During the period, each area had its own different clothing style. The islanders, from the westernmost Ionian islands to the easternmost Cyprus, used to wear the Vraka, a type of traditional breeches. At the rural areas, a popular clothing was the fustanella, a traditional skirt-like garment. Fustanella was worn also by the klephts and the armatoloi.. and predominantly by the Arvanites of Greece as described by foreign travelers. Apart from them, the wealthy Greeks of the urban centres adopted the Western European-style dress. Modern period Spyros Louis wearing a fustanella In the independent Greece, Otto and Amalia were the first to be interested in fashion matters. Amalia created a romantic folksy court dress, which became a national Greek costume still known as the Amal√≠a dress. National Costume of Greece It follows the Biedermeier style, with a loose-fitting, white cotton or silk shirt, often decorated with lace at the neck and handcuffs, over which a richly embroidered jacket or vest is worn, usually of dark blue or claret velvet. The skirt was ankle-length, unpressed-pleated silk, the color usually azure. It was completed with a soft cap or fez with a single, long, golden silk tassel, traditionally worn by married women, or with the kalpaki (a toque) of the unmarried woman, and sometimes with a black veil for church. This dress became the usual attire of all Christian townswomen in both Ottoman Empire-occupied and liberated Balkan lands as far north as Belgrade. Otto adopted the fustanella for his personal guard, still in use by the Evzones, members of the Presidential Guard. Since then, the Greek fashion follows the European standards. However completely black clothing is worn for one year in mourning. A clich√© depicts also the mountainous Cretans wearing black trousers, shirts, black stivania (Cretan type of boot), black sariki (Cretan type of woven headscarf), and gold neck chain.

Background Eckels' father, Robert Young \\"Bob\\" Eckels, Jr., was a trustee of the Houston Independent School District who in 1972 was elected the Precinct 3 county commissioner, a position that he filled until shortly before his death on Christmas Eve in 1989.Each Texas county regardless of population has four county commissioners from single-member districts. The county judge, who is elected countywide, can break a 2-2 deadlock on the commission. As commissioner, the senior Eckels was accused of having tapped his office telephones, mail fraud, and theft of timber used on county bridge construction. In 1987, he pleaded no contest to charges that he had accepted from a county contractor the construction of a road on his farm in Austin County within the Houston metropolitan district. Eckels told The Houston Chronicle that his father \\"played the [political] game by their rules. The world has moved.\\" The senior Eckels had close political ties with Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush. In 1984, while his son was a first-term legislator, Commissioner Eckels turned the Harris County government into a virtual arm of the Reagan-Bush re-election campaign. He used county telephones, computers, and employees to establish an organization called the National Conference of Republican County Officials. An official in Roanoke County, Virginia, said that the conference was \\"a working arm for the White House and the national [Republican] Party.\\" Eckels later said that he had used at least $20,000 of his own funds for Reagan-Bush mailings and did not report the expenditure to the Federal Election Commission. Eckels died less than a year after Bush became the U.S. President. The seventeen-year commissioner was convicted of theft and forced to resign. Eckels' uncle, Paul Glenn \\"Buck\\" Eckels, Sr. (1931-2011), for many years owned the Lawyers Title Insurance Company of Houston. Eckels graduated from Houston Christian High School, the University of Houston, and the South Texas College of Law in Houston. He currently practices law with Husch Blackwell. He is also the president of Texas Central High-Speed Railway, also called Lone Star High Speed Rail. He was formerly affiliated with Fulbright & Jaworski in Houston. His wife, the former Jet Winkley (born c. 1957), was a lobbyist for the Metropolitan Transit Authority while she and Eckels were engaged and he was a state legislator. Eckels said that because of their relationship he avoided sponsoring transit authority bills. The couple has a daughter, Kirby Eckels. Political life In 1982 at the age of twenty-five, Eckels was elected to the first of his six terms in the House. At the time Bill Clements, the first Republican governor of Texas since Reconstruction, was simultaneously unseated by the Democrat Mark White, then the state attorney general. Eckels did not seek a seventh term in 1994, when George W. Bush was elected governor. He represented the newly numbered House District 133 in Harris County. In his last general election for the legislature in 1992, Eckels had no Democratic opponent but defeated Clyde Garland, nominee of the Libertarian Party, 39,518 votes (88 percent) to 5,413 (12 percent). Eckels was succeeded in the House in 1995 by the Houston lawyer Joe Nixon, a Republican who also served District 133 for six terms. Upon leaving the house, Eckels began a twelve-year stint as the county judge of the most populous county in Texas. He succeeded the 20-year incumbent, Moderate Republican Jon Lindsay, who caught up in scandal did not run again for county judge. Lindsay and the senior Eckels had been colleagues and occasional rivals on the commissioners court. However, Lindsay supported the younger Eckels for county judge in 1994, when Eckels defeated the Democrat Vince Ryan (born c. 1947). Lindsay himself rebounded politically to win election in 1996 to the District 7 seat in the Texas State Senate. As county judge, Eckels also chaired the Harris County Toll Road Authority, the only county-owned toll road system in the United States. Judge Eckels received international recognition for the response by Harris County to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The Astrodome and Reliant Park became the largest shelter operation in American history, with more than 250,000 residents given refuge during the storm. In 2005, Esquire named Eckels the \\"Best and Brightest - Citizen of the Year\\" for his leadership during the storms: \\"When the City of New Orleans evacuated to Houston, Harris County Judge Robert Eckels was an island of competence in the face of catastrophe.\\" The American City and County Magazine named Eckels \\"County Leader of the Year 2006.\\" In 2006, Eckels was actually elected to a fourth term as county judge but left some four months later to enter the private sector. Commissioners named transportation consultant and former state Representative Ed Emmett of Kingwood in northeast Houston to succeed Eckels as county judge. Upon his death, Eckels will be interred at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin.

Created in 2000, IRENav is labeled (EA3634) within the framework of the laboratories of the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Arts et M√©tiers and evaluated by the HCERES (Haut Conseil de l‚Äô√©valuation de la recherche et de l‚Äôenseignement sup√©rieur). It is also a member of the Institut Carnot Arts, a major research network that drives industrial innovation at the national level. IRENAV develops maritime and naval research activities in the fields of mechanical engineering, energy conversion and maritime information systems and underwater acoustics. IRENav is the essential support for the scientific training of Naval Engineering student cadets in the fields of Mechanics, Energy, Underwater Acoustics, Signal Processing, Computer Science and Information Systems. It is made up of about 65 research and teaching members of staff, including 25 academics and post-doctoral researchers, about 25 PhD students and 15 technical and administrative support. The institute's activities are intended to be dual, addressing both military and civilian research problems in the context of the ship of the future. Research activities are oriented towards mechanics and energy from a hydrodynamic and electrotechnical point of view, observation of the marine environment using underwater acoustic techniques (ASM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The research is conducted by two groups. IRENAV - Cavitation tunnel  The M2EN group (Mechanics and Energy in Naval Environment)  Flexible hydrofoil during experimental campaign in cavitation tunnel The Marine Engineering and Energy Group (M2EN) is a multidisciplinary group in fluid mechanics and electrical engineering. The research is organized along two axes in interaction. The first relates to hydrodynamics, and in particular fluid structure interactions in heavy fluid and two-phase flows. The second deals with energy conversion from the angle of modeling and the design of conversion chains and the development of unconventional electric machines for propulsion. The team has unique experimental means (hydrodynamic platform, instrumentation) and develops high value-added measurement techniques to characterize and understand the physical phenomena specific to naval systems. The upstream and dual character of the team's research makes it possible to open up research in the field of energy in the broad sense as that of the naval propulsion for the ship of the future and the prospective one of the Marine Energies.  The group MOTIM (Modeling and Processing of Maritime Information)  The Maritime Information Modeling and Processing Group (MoTIM) is a multidisciplinary group whose research focuses on the processing of maritime information, involving three complementary areas of research: information science, acoustic acoustics, marine and signal processing. In the field of Information Science, the research developed is based on the theory and modeling of geographic and temporal information. Underwater Acoustics work resides in the interaction between real work and the development of physical models and signal processing tools (time-frequency analysis). One of the group's research projects is Cyber Defense related to the Chair of Cyber Defense of Naval Systems.  The Chair of \\"Cyber Defense of Naval Systems\\"  The Chair of \\"Cyber Defense of Naval Systems\\" was created in October 2014 under the tutelage of the French Navy as part of the Cyber Action Plan decided by the Minister of the Armed Forces ; it hasa strong legitimacy in the naval field. The chair includes two privileged academic partners: IMT Atlantique and ENSTA Bretagne. The two industrial partners Naval Group and Thales (leaders of their sector) and research scientists(scientific experts in cyberdefense) reinforce the cyber expertise of the chair. The Chair of Cyber Defense of Naval Systems is at the heart of a strategic ecosystem driven by issues of cybernetic attacks in the maritime environment. The project has, since the beginning, benefited from the support of the French Navy, the Brittany region and the Cyber Center of Excellence.  A Research Center for Maritime Innovation and Technology Transfer  Through its research institute, the French Naval Academy contributes to the generation of new knowledge and technology transfers in the naval field. The research and innovation draw on contractual relationships with large industrial companies and SMEs to which researchers provide their expertise through PhD programs, contracts, services, collaborations, industrial chairs... These actions are supported by a series of major valorisation partners: * Institut Carnot ARTS (Research Actions for Technology and Society): The Carnot label is given to public research laboratories which develop research activities alongside with socio-economic actors, in order to respond to their needs. * AMValor: technology transfer branch of Arts & M√©tiers which promotes research partnerships activities through collaborations between laboratories and businesses. * SATT Ouest Valorisation: ensures public research results valorisation in order to offer innovation resources. * R√©seau NO√â: network that gathers actors of the European research and innovation projects in the Western part of France.  Civil training courses at IRENAV  *The M2 research master's degree in Mechanics and Energy in Naval Environment (Ecole Navale-Arts et M√©tiers ParisTech) This M2 level training focuses mainly on the acquisition of in- depth knowledge of the upstream study of naval environment systems through a substantially multidisciplinary approach. This training builds on the unique skills and resources of IRENav in the research areas. This M2 research master is proposed in co-supervision between the √âcole Navale and the ENSAM and opens perspectives of doctoral training within the IRENav and its academic and industrial partners. *Atlantic Master in Ship Operations and Naval Engineering (AMASONE) The √âcole navale and the √âcole Centrale de Nantes have joined forces to offer an international master's degree course in naval engineering and naval operations. This master is aimed mainly at foreign students who wish to perfect their training in France in the disciplines of marine engineering. This training in hydrodynamics and propulsion is based on a practical experience of ship steering and gives an important place to the techniques of conducting operations.

Founding a band at thirteen, in 1974, Janson today works with both domestic and international artists. Career =Early years= Janson was born and raised in Hammar√∂, in the province of V√§rmland, Sweden. At the age of nine, he began taking cello lessons while three years later starting to learn how to play the guitar, today his main instrument. Before entering high school, where he studied music, Janson already had founded his own jazz-rock band, Mantra, in which he played the guitar and wrote all the music. The band was dissolved in 1981 when Janson decided to move to Stockholm, where he lives today. Settled in the capital, Janson became a coveted studio musician also frequently being engaged as a record producer and music arranger. In addition he worked as a guitarist on tours with artists such as Roxette, Michael Ruff Band, Nils Landgren Funk Unit, Tomas Ledin and Ratata. In 1989 Janson recorded and released a solo album, Livingroom, for which he was nominated a Swedish Grammis Award, equivalent to the Grammy in the USA. =String- and orchestra arranger= In 1992 Henrik teamed up with his brother Ulf Janson starting to write music arrangements for orchestras, both also working as conductors. Through the years they have collaborated with The London Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and The Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra. The opera crossover quartet Il Divo was formed by the music manager Simon Cowell in 2003. Their self-titled debut album was released in November the following year and went straight to number one in the UK and in seven other countries. Henrik and Ulf Janson arranged the orchestra and worked as conductors on parts of the album, which they also did on the group‚Äôs following two UK number one studio albums Ancora and Siempre. On each three records, Henrik also was engaged as a guitarist. In June 2007, the British tenor Paul Potts was crowned winner of the first season of ITV‚Äôs talent show Britain‚Äôs Got Talent. Potts‚Äô debut album One Chance, including Jansons‚Äô arrangements for orchestra which the brothers also conducted, came out a month later. Just like Il Divo‚Äôs first album it went to number one in the UK, as well as in eight other countries. Two years later, in 2009, they returned working with Potts on his sophomore album Passione. String arrangements by Janson are also found on seven UK Top 40 number one songs: *\\"Hallelujah\\" with Alexandra Burke, the 2008 X Factor-winner *\\"That‚Äôs My Goal\\" with Shayne Ward, the 2005 X Factor-winner *\\"Evergreen\\" with Will Young, the 2002 Pop Idol-winner *\\"Anyone of Us (Stupid Mistake)\\" with Gareth Gates, the 2002 Pop Idol runner-up *\\"If I Let You Go,\\" \\"Fool Again\\" and \\"My Love,\\" all with Westlife, released in 1999-2000.

He served as the marzban of Persian Armenia briefly in 482.  Biography  Coin of Peroz I. Shapur belonged to the House of Mihran, one of the Seven Parthian clans; he was the son of a certain Mihran. He was a foster brother of the Sasanian shah Peroz I, who was himself married to a princess from the Mihran family. During the reign of Peroz, the Mihran family enjoyed a high status, and played an important role in Sasanian politics. Shapur, during his youth, was raised in Armenia, which made him, unlike other Sasanian nobles, act more tolerant towards Christianity.Pourshariati (2008), p. 74 Map of Persian Armenia. In 475, the Mamikonian princess Shushanik was murdered by her husband Prince Varsken, who was a convert to Zoroastrianism, and related to the Mihran family. The reason for this murder was because she had refused to convert to Zoroastrianism and wanted to stay Christian. Varsken, because of his actions, was in 482 executed by Vakhtang I, king of Iberia. Peroz I sent an army to punish Vakhtang for intervening. However, Vakhtang was joined by the Armenians, and a revolt broke out in Armenia, led by Vahan I Mamikonian. Peroz I, eager to avenge Varsken, sent his general Shapur Mihran to Iberia. To defend himself, Vakhtang appealed to the Huns and the Armenian nobles, citing solidarity between Christians. After carefully weighing the decision, Vahan Mamikonian agreed to revolt against the Sasanians. He defeated the marzban Adhur Gushnasp, and declared Sahak II Bagratuni as the new marzban. He also kept defeating several Sasanian counter-attacks. In 482, Shapur Mihran began to become a big threat to the security of Iberia, which made Vakhtang request Armenian help. Vahan and Sahak shortly arrived to Iberia at the head of a big army, but were defeated in Akesga, where Sahak was killed. Vahan fled with the remnants of the Armenian army into the mountains, where he led guerrilla actions against the Sasanians, while Shapur managed to regain control of Armenia. However, Shapur was shortly ordered to return to the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon. Vahan quickly used the opportunity to regain control of Armenia. In the spring of 484, however, Shapur Mihran returned as the head of a new army and forced Vahan to flee to refuge near the Byzantine frontier, at Tao and Taron.Grousset (1947), p. 223 During the same period, the Sasanian noble Zarmihr Karen from the Karenid family, was also successful in a campaign against the Armenians, and managed to capture several of them, including nobles from the Kamsarakan family. Zarmihr shortly delivered the Armenian captives to Shapur, who delivered them to Izad Gushnasp, and promised the Armenian captives to make Peroz spare them.Pourshariati (2008), p. 74 During the same period, several of Shapur's relatives, including his father Mihran,Pourshariati (2008), p. 75 were summoned by Peroz to aid him in his campaigns against in Central Asia against the Hephthalites. However, the campaign ended disastrously, and all of the Sasanian army, including Peroz and Mihran, were exterminated. After hearing about the death of Peroz I, Shapur left Caucasus and returned to Ctesiphon, in order to protect the Sasanian Empire from the Hephthalites and to elect a new king. Balash, the brother of Peroz I, was crowned as the new king of the Sasanian Empire. However, it was in reality the father of Zarmihr Karen, Sukhra who exercised real power over the Sasanian Empire.Pourshariati (2008), p. 75Schindel (2013), pp. 136-141 After this event, Shapur is no longer mentioned in any sources.

The bill also sought to authorize NOAA to carry out various other activities related to weather forecasting and research. The bill was introduced in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background \\"Severe weather\\" refers to any dangerous meteorological phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life. Types of severe weather phenomena vary, depending on the latitude, altitude, topography, and atmospheric conditions. High winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, downbursts, lightning, tornadoes, waterspouts, tropical cyclones, and extratropical cyclones. Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and duststorms. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Weather Forecasting Improvement Act of 2013 meant to require the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere (and also the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration [NOAA]) to make certain weather-related activities concerning public safety and the national economy the top priority in the planning and management of programs within all relevant NOAA line offices. Had it been enacted, it would have directed the Assistant Administrator of the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) to: (1) undertake a program to develop an improved understanding of forecast capabilities for atmospheric events; (2) establish a tornado warning extension program; and (3) issue a plan for restoring U.S. leadership in weather modeling, prediction, and forecasting. The Under Secretary would have been required to: (1) develop a prioritized list of observation data requirements necessary to ensure weather forecasting capabilities to protect life and property; (2) undertake ongoing systematic evaluations of observing systems, data, and information needed to meet the requirements developed under such priority list; (3) identify current and potential future data gaps in observing capabilities related to such requirements; and (4) determine a range of options to address the gaps identified. The OAR Assistant Administrator would have been instructed to undertake Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) to assess the relative value and benefits of observing capabilities and systems. Allows technical and scientific OSSE evaluations to include assessments of the impact of observing capabilities on global weather prediction, hurricane track and intensity forecasting, tornado warning times and accuracy, and prediction of mid-latitude severe local storm outbreaks. OSSEs would have been required to determine the potential impact of proposed space-based, sub-orbital, and in- situ observing systems on analyses and forecasts; to evaluate and compare observing system design options; and to assess the relative capabilities and costs of various and combinations of observing systems in providing data necessary for the protection of life and property. Conducting an OSSE would have been required before the acquisition of major government-owned or government-leased operational observing systems, before the purchase of new commercially provided data critical to forecast accuracy, and for any existing commercially provided observing system data contracts exceeding $15 million. Permits OSSEs to be conducted on existing observing systems where such data costs NOAA in excess of $20 million. Procedural history The Weather Forecasting Improvement Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on June 18, 2013 by Republican Jim Bridenstine of Oklahoma's 1st congressional district. It was referred to the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology and the United States House Science Subcommittee on Environment. On December 5, 2013, it was ordered to be reported in the nature of a substitute (amended) by a voice vote of the Science Committee. On March 21, 2014, it was reported (amended) alongside House Report 113-383. Debate and discussion The bill's sponsor Rep. Bridenstine introduced the bill in response to several 2013 Oklahoma tornadoes. Bridenstine said that \\"my state has seen all too many times the destructive power of tornadoes and severe weather. In the wake of the latest outbreak in May that cost 48 lives, it is painfully clear that we must do more.\\" Bridenstine noted that he believed more money should be spent on weather forecasting instead of climate change. According to Republican Chairman of the Environment Subcommittee Chris Stewart, the bill \\"prioritizes protection of public safety and forward-looking weather research, improves procurement of observing system data from space, air, and land, and opens up NOAA's process to encourage private sector weather solutions.\\" When it was introduced, the bill only had Republican support, although at least seven Democrats later became co-sponsors, in part due to language changes from the committee stage. According to liberal blog Think Progress, \\"both sides agree that increased funding for weather forecasting research is critical, but Democrats criticized Republican plans to take money away from climate change research, which already contributes to weather prediction capabilities.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Weather forecasting *Global Forecast System *Climate change in the United States *Climate change policy of the United States References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 2413 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 2413 *GovTrack.us H.R. 2413 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 2413 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 2413 *Congressional Budget Office's report on H.R. 2413 *House Republican Conference's legislative digest on H.R. 2413 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress ","title":"Weather Forecasting Improvement Act of 2013"},{"id":"42362118","text":"The 2014 World Snooker Championship (also referred to as the 2014 Dafabet World Snooker Championship for the purposes of sponsorship) was a professional snooker tournament, that took place from 19 April to 5 May 2014 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England.

Six-time runner-up Jimmy White lost in the second qualifying round to Ian Burns 10‚Äì4, whilst two-time runner-up Matthew Stevens lost to Tom Ford. For the first time, no Welsh player automatically qualified to play at the Crucible. Three Welshmen, Dominic Dale, Michael White, and Ryan Day, won places in the first round through qualification. At the age of 44, 1997 champion Ken Doherty defeated Dechawat Poomjaeng 10‚Äì5 in qualifying to become the oldest player to reach the main stage. Kyren Wilson, Michael Wasley, Xiao Guodong, and Robbie Williams all made their debuts in the competition by coming through qualifying. =First round= Debutant Michael Wasley defeated fourth seed Ding Junhui 10‚Äì9 in the opening round The first round was played as best-of-19 over two between 19 and 24 April 2014. Defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan drew world number 122 Robin Hull in the first round. O'Sullivan defeated Hull 10‚Äì4. The 2010 World Snooker Championship winner Neil Robertson won his first round match against Robbie Williams, leading 7‚Äì2 after the first session, and later 10‚Äì2. In his victory, he compiled breaks of 102, 102, 103, 132, and the tournament's highest of 140 to take his season total of century breaks to 97. The 2005 champion Shaun Murphy trailed 5‚Äì7 behind against Jamie Cope, before the pair played a deciding frame at 9‚Äì9. Murphy took the frame 65‚Äì49 to win the match. Third seed Mark Selby also won a deciding frame, as he defeated Michael White 10‚Äì9.

He's been the best player over 17 days, that was tough he had me in all sorts of trouble. In the end I was numb as he was too strong and tough.\\" Selby dedicated the title to his late father, who died two months before he turned professional.

Birth He was born in 1958 in the old city of Sana'a in Yemen. His father is a well- known public figure in Yemen, a scholar and judge in Islamic Sharia‚Äôa and the Mufti of the Republic of Yemen Allama Mohammed bin Ismail Al Amrani. About his life He completed his preliminary studies in Yemen, then continued in the University of Baghdad, College of Political Science, and after graduating Bachelor in political science with a \\"B‚Äù grade, he continued his postgraduate studies and was awarded a higher diploma in International Politics. He joined the diplomatic corps in the mid-eighties until he became ambassador in the Yemeni Foreign Ministry. He represented his country in Yemen's missions to Arab countries, Europe and America. He also participated as a member of the Yemeni delegation in international conferences such as the Non-Aligned Summit and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation During his career, Alamrani received invitations from Arab and international scientific bodies, organizations and institutions to participate and attend seminars and political, cultural, intellectual and social activities, in Brussels and the European Union, on the one hand, and on bilateral relations between the European Union and Yemen or the European Union relations, on the other, including a conference on religions (Christian, Islamic, Muslim) in Brussels when he was in office in the Yemeni Mission in Belgium and the European Union. He also attended similar events in Washington, capital city of the USA and in Arab and non-Arab capitals. He also participated in cultural events and seminars inside and outside Yemen. During office at the Embassy to Washington in the nineties, he was awarded membership of the Academy of Political Science after publishing a study in an American magazine specializing in political development. He visited about thirty-five countries, whether officially or privately and mentioned them in his literary book \\"Yemeni vision in travel literature\\", observations and impressions from East and West. His name appeared in the International Encyclopedia as a diplomatic figure, who was given the opportunity to travel and see round the world. He wrote his memoirs in articles specialized in travel literature and collected them in his book, which became part of the international encyclopedia (Yokopedia). His name was included within the (Yemeni Encyclopedia for Media and Authors of Yemen), which is a comprehensive knowledge encyclopedia of twenty volumes on the past and present most prominent Yemeni figures, devoting a full-page to his biography as a diplomat and author. Alamrani began press-writing at an early age and published a series of articles in Yemeni and Arabic newspapers [2] that were characterized by sharpness and criticism of the foreign policy of the regime, to the extent that he was banned from writing by the Yemeni authorities for years. Then he returned to writing after the fall of the regime of President Ali Abdullah Saleh following the revolution that broke out in Yemen in early 2011. He was banned again from writing in early February 2014 along with some ambassadors who write in the newspapers, because of their continuous criticism of corruption and performance of the government [3] as well as their criticism of the foreign policy and state formation, especially with regard to federalism and the outcomes of the national dialogue [4] [5] [6], although there are Yemeni diplomats and ambassadors who write in the newspapers to-date without being prosecuted or banned because they are affiliated with political, partisan or family power centers. Observers believe that the reason for this ban is because the change has not been complete in Yemen, and oppression of freedom continues according to the mood of those in power in the post-11 February revolution. The incidence of harassment in Yemen has increased for journalists and politicians, and freedom of opinion has completely disappeared during the last six years following the fall of Sana‚Äôa, the Yemeni capital, in the hands of the Houthi militia in September 2014. Oppression of freedoms has reached its utmost due to the war. Violations against local and regional human rights bodies and organizations and against authors and influential figures, whether political or cultural, reached a record during the war years. Alamrani had left Yemen a few weeks after the period between the fall of Sana'a in the hands of the Houthis and the outbreak of the war to receive treatment outside Yemen. Large numbers of Yemenis had left Yemen, some of them had political stands such as writers, media specialists and diplomats, including \\"the author of this biography\\", the writer and author Abdul Wahab Alamrani, who is persecuted by the Houthi authorities inside Yemen, and whose family cannot return to Yemen in these circumstances. Yemen has become an insecure region, whether in the north (the Houthis) or in the south (which is controlled by the Emirates and the coalition countries that are waging war on Yemen) While the legitimate government itself spent more than five years outside Yemen, and because the writer Alamrani continued to criticize corruption and lack of respect for human rights of all the conflicting parties in Yemen, whether the illegal militia (the Houthi and the Southern Movement) or the internationally recognized legal authority that lies outside Yemen, the outcome of the absence and corruption of the legal government was reflected on the lives of many Yemeni. Ambassador Alamrani, even though he was an official employee in the diplomatic corps of the internationally recognized Yemeni legitimate government, the latter's position is no longer loyal to its Employees.

His early life and schooling was Biddeford where his father ran a boot and shoe shop. During his school life when he was 14, Walter started an amateur newspaper, \\"The Snow Flake\\". He was a collector of newspapers and had a collection of over 130 papers from 25 states and Canada in this manner and had an interest in telegraphy which he started studying during his school years. Walter was also known to be active in productions put on by Universalist Society, of which he was a member. Walter graduated from Biddeford High School in 1876. From a telegraph operator to a stage actor to a film actor, Walter Perkins' life covered numerous stage shows and sixteen films. He died in Brooklyn, New York, on June 3, 1925, following a short illness caused by food poisoning. Perkins was memorialized both in Maine and back in New York. His New York funeral took place at the famous Frank E.

The next day Perkins' remains arrived home in Biddeford for the local funeral at the family home on Chadwick Place, and he was then laid to rest at the family plot at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Saco. In this tribute, written to accompany his obituary in the Biddeford Daily Journal by Mrs. Estelle Tatterson, Perkins was remembered as: Walter had no enemies. His acquaintances were at once his friends. That was one of his greatest gifts‚Äîfriendship. He never married. There were too many flowers in Cupid's garden for him to choose. He loved them all. His friends are thankful that he had not to pass through long months of suffering, but left us as he would have desired. All honor to a beloved son of old Biddeford and let us all stop in our busy lives to pay a silent tribute and offer a silent prayer of thanksgiving for having known Walter E.

A year later, he left for Boston to pursue his dream of becoming a stage actor. Till 1920s, he acted small parts in various comedies when he was hired by Charles Frohman, a Broadway producer. The first notable role came his way, at the age of 37, when Henry A. Souchet, who was a friend, wrote a part specially for Perkins in his farcical play My Friend from India. The play, which opened on 6 October 1896 at the Bijou Theatre, in Broadway, was a success and elevated the status of both the actor and the author, with Perkins in the starring role as \\"A. Keene Shaver\\". Advertisement for My Friend From India, 1899. Du Souchet and Perkins had a successful professional relationship, and went on to produce other successful shows including The Man from Mexico, Toppy, and Who Goes There? together.

He also had successes in non-Du Souchet productions, including All the Comforts of Home, Charley's Aunt (in which he acted in drag), The Lost Paradise, Held by the Enemy, and Pa Potter. Perkins is reported to have played in every city and town of consequence in every state of the Union, though much of his time was spent in the long runs of his several successes in the bigger cities of the country. Through his performances across the country, Perkins reported to have become famous as a comedic actor.

They were intended to police Germany's recently acquired colonial empire. Leo von Caprivi, then the Chief of the Kaiserliche Marine, requested cruisers that had the range to operate abroad, but which also possessed sufficient combat power to be useful in time of war; the old sailing ships so poorly armed that they were ineffective as combat ships.Sondhaus, pp. 166‚Äì167 Schwalbe and Sperber were therefore armed with a main battery of eight guns.Gr√∂ner, p. 93 Both ships served abroad for the majority of their careers, primarily in Germany's African colonies and in Asia and the Pacific. Their service lives were generally uneventful, apart from the normal routine of colonial policing. They were both sent to German East Africa to help put down the Abushiri Revolt in 1889‚Äì90, and Schwalbe joined the Eight Nation Alliance against the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz Vol. 7, p. 147 Both ships were decommissioned by 1911 and were thereafter used for secondary roles: Schwalbe as a training ship and Sperber as a target ship.

They were larger and faster, with a comparable cruising radius and the same number and caliber of guns, though all but the first ship were equipped with new quick-firing models. The Bussard class was also the last cruiser design to incorporate a sailing rig in the German Navy.Gr√∂ner, pp. 93‚Äì99Gardiner, p. 253 All five ships served extensively in Germany's colonial possessions in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.

Cormoran and Geier remained in the Pacific at the outbreak of World War I; the former's engines were worn out and she was scuttled in Tsingtao. Geier briefly attacked British shipping in the Pacific but put into Hawaii after running out of fuel. She was interned, seized by the US Navy in 1917, and commissioned as USS Schurz; she briefly served in the US Navy before she was accidentally rammed and sunk by a freighter in June 1918. Meanwhile, Seeadler was destroyed by an accidental explosion in 1917.

The resulting design was unsatisfactory, since the requirements for the roles were contradictory. For example, powerful engines necessary for the high top speeds needed in a fleet scout were also very coal hungry, which reduced the ship's endurance; a long cruising radius was mandatory for ships intended to police Germany's far-flung colonial empire, however.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz Vol. 3, p. 194 Construction of the ship was extended due to ventilation problems discovered during sea trials, which necessitated lengthy modifications. She spent the first two and a half years in Germany before being deployed to the East Asia Squadron at the end of 1897. She was present during the Boxer Rebellion and took part in the Battle of Taku Forts in 1900. Gefion returned to Germany in late 1901, where she was modernized and then placed in reserve. She was to be recommissioned after the start of World War I, but shortages of personnel prevented her return to active service. Instead, she was used as a barracks ship. After the war, she was converted into a freighter and renamed Adolf Sommerfeld, though the conversion was not particularly successful and she was scrapped in 1923.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz Vol. 3, pp. 194‚Äì196 { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Gefion class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  10 √ó 10.5 cm SK L/35 guns  2 √ó 3-cylinder triple expansion engines,  1892Gr√∂ner, p. 99  5 June 1895  Converted to freighter, 1920, scrapped 1923 } Notes =Footnotes= =Citations= References   Unprotected cruisers German unprotected cruisers ","title":"List of unprotected cruisers of Germany"},{"id":"42362667","text":"Killanena () is a townland and formerly a District Electoral Division (DED) in County Clare, Ireland, in the Catholic parish of Killanena and Flagmount.

Having two or more different cell types is called mosaicism. Diploid-triploid mosaicism can be associated with truncal obesity, body/facial asymmetry, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), delays in growth, mild differences in facial features, fusion or webbing between some of the fingers and/or toes (syndactyly) and irregularities in the skin pigmentation. Intellectual disabilities may be present but are highly variable from person to person ranging from mild to more severe. The chromosome disorder is usually not present in the blood; a skin biopsy, or analyzing cells in the urine is needed to detect the triploid cells. A regular human carries 23 pairs of chromosomes in his or her cells. Cells containing two pairs of chromosomes are known as diploid cells. Those with diploid triploid mosaicism have some cells which are triploid, meaning that they have three copies of chromosomes, or a total of 69 chromosomes. Triploidy is distinct from trisomy, in which only one chromosome exists in three pairs. A well-known example of trisomy is trisomy 21 or Down syndrome.

Initially, he focused on decorative painting, but soon turned to genre scenes, featuring Martin Luther and Queen Louise. In the 1890s, he once again switched styles, this time to portrait painting. He made himself welcome at court, where he produced canvases of the Grand Duke and Duchess of Baden and the Crown prince Friedrich III. He also painted several portraits of University professors (including Arthur Auwers and Karl M√∂bius). Later, he ventured into painting scenes from history and literature (such as Gretchen in Prison, a scene from Goethe's Faust).

History Saint Martha Catholic School was opened in 1950 and had its first campus near St. Martha Catholic Church. In the early 1990s, the school felt they needed to move campuses to a new and bigger location, so they selected the present day location. Funding was secured by parish donations and other benefactors. Construction began and was finished in 2002 when both school's and the campus finally opened.

The reason for this murder was because she had refused to convert to Zoroastrianism and wanted to stay Christian. Varsken, because of his actions was in 482 executed by Vakhtang I, king of Iberia. The Sasanian shah Peroz I shortly sent an army to punish Vakhtang for intervening. However, Vakhtang was joined by the Armenians, and a revolt broke out in Armenia, led by Vahan I Mamikonian and Sahak II. Vahan and Sahak managed to defeat the marzban Adhur Gushnasp, and Sahak was shortly declared by Vahan and the other Armenians as the marzban of Armenia. However, in 482, Peroz sent an army under Shapur Mihran, which defeated the Armenian rebels, killing Sahak. Vahan then fled to the mountains, while Shapur regained control of Armenia. Sahak hah a son named Spandiat, who was given the title of aspet after his death.

The name, which dates much further back than the creation of the civil parish, refers to a small settlement in the eastern area of Ludlow. History The civil parish was formed in 1884 when the southern part of Stanton Lacy parish that bordered Ludlow was transferred to Bromfield, Bitterley and a third part to the new civil parish of East Hamlet.Vision of Britain East Hamlet Due to the eastwards growth of Ludlow's urban area, East Hamlet had parts ceded to Ludlow's civil parish in 1901 and again in 1934. In 1987 the remainder (a small rump of what was originally a small parish) was largely transferred to Ludford civil parish (the part to the east of the A49 by-pass) and small parts to both Ludlow (the part within the by-pass) and Bromfield (Wigley and Fishmore). This abolished East Hamlet, with Ludford named as its successor parish.South Shropshire Parishes Order 1987 Present-day The post office on Gravel Hill in Ludlow is still formally East Hamlet Post Office.

History Boylan, from County Louth, was the owner of a trucking firm in Ardee and had numerous drugs convictions in England and Ireland. In December 2003, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI) caught him at Dublin Port in possession of heroin and cocaine worth ‚Ç¨¬Ä750,000. He was sentenced to five years imprisonment in December 2005. On 6 October 2005, while on bail, members of the Garda National Drug Unit (GNDU) caught Boylan in possession of heroin and cocaine worth ‚Ç¨1.7 million in the yard of his trucking firm. The case against him was withdrawn twice, the second time in July 2008 when his trial collapsed, leading to reports that the convicted drug dealer had been assisted by garda√≠ (members of An Garda S√≠och√°na). Inquiry The publicity around this matter led to the Garda S√≠och√°na Ombudsman Commission's widest, longest and costliest inquiry, with the Ombudsman sending the Kieran Boylan file to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) In December 2012. In May 2013, the investigation concluded with no evidence established of any improper conduct by garda√≠. It was later revealed that garda√≠ had disrupted the GSOC's investigation and refused to co-operate with it. In 2014, the GSOC disclosed to the general public that there had been a security alert at their office, an event which, it was later revealed, resulted from a suspicion that garda√≠ were bugging the office due to the GSOC's investigation into the Kieran Boylan affair. Sinn F√©in President Gerry Adams told the D√°il on 19 February 2014 ‚ÄúToday, following a radio interview in which I was asked about the Boylan angle, I was contacted at my D√°il office by a man who said he was the Kieran Boylan in question. He objected strongly to Sinn F√©in highlighting this aspect of the bugging scandal.‚Äù In the midst of these events, Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan was granted a further two years in his role by justice minister Alan Shatter, due to last until August 2015. However, on 25 March 2014, Callinan resigned over his remarks about whistleblowers, leaving in his wake the first revelations to the general public of widespread Garda phone recordings of civilians.

Robinson pushed for equal opportunities for African-Americans during his early career, and was able to open his own eponymous aviation school in addition to initiating a program for black pilots at his college, the Tuskegee Institute. Robinson's achievements as an aviator were in stark contrast to the limited opportunities for most African-Americans in aviation careers, and were an important factor in reducing racially based prohibitions in the United States. Robinson is sometimes referred to as the \\"Father of the Tuskegee Airmen\\" for inspiring this all-black group of pilots who served in the United States Army Air Forces following the United States' entry into World War II.  Early life  Robinson was born in 1903, in Carrabelle, Florida, and spent his early years in Gulfport, Mississippi. His birth father died when he was a baby, leaving him and his four-year-old sister, Bertha, with their mother Celeste Robinson, who then married Charles Cobb. Robinson was inspired by flight at an early age. According to one account, in 1910, Robinson was seven years old when he witnessed a float-equipped biplane flown by John Moisant in Gulfport, Mississippi.  Education  Robinson completed his education at Gulfport High School for the Colored in 1919, where he developed a strong interest in mechanics and machinery. However, Robinson could not continue his education in Gulfport; African-Americans were barred from continuing their education beyond the tenth grade. Robinson subsequently made preparations to attend the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. He first attended college at the Tuskegee Institute in September 1921 to study automotive mechanical science, graduating three years later. In addition to studying automobiles, he learned math, literature, composition and history. He repeatedly applied to the Curtiss- Wright School of Aviation in Chicago, but was denied each time. He ended up getting a job there as a janitor and unofficially sat in on classes until an instructor managed to secure a place for him, and was the first black student at the school.  Early employment  Prior to entering college, Robinson held a short-term job as shoeshine man before getting a job as warehouse personnel. After finishing his college degree, Robinson was unable to find a suitable career in his hometown of Gulfport. Robinson attributed this to racial discrimination as many of the local garages were under white ownership; speaking to his father, he said, \\"[The garage owners will] give me a job sweeping, filling gas tanks, changing tires, or washing, but I'm an engine man ... When I talk to [them] about automotive science they smile, look at each other, and then look at me like I belong behind a mule and a plow.\\" Robinson consequently moved to the Detroit area, where jobs in the automotive industry might be more plentiful. There, he had difficulty finding a line of work that his college degree would have ensured him, mainly due to his extensive knowledge on the trade being unwelcome by those who could not keep up with his intellect. Robinson continued to refuse jobs sweeping or as a messenger boy, and managed to become a mechanic's assistant instead. Despite continued discrimination and failure to acknowledge his experience from some of his white coworkers, Robinson's skill was noticed and he was promoted to a full mechanic and was given a pay raise. Sometime later, he was approached by taxi cab owner named Fitzgerald who offered to double his pay to work for his garage. Robinson took the job, but was never comfortable working for a business that secretly bootlegged whiskey to Canada during the Prohibition Age.  Aviation  = Early flights = Despite his successes as a mechanic, Robinson began searching for means to take to the air. He was eventually directed to a small field, where he met pilots Robert Williamson and Percy, and earned his first flight in Robert's Waco 9 after fixing the engine on Percy's Curtiss JN-4D (Jenny). Robinson was determined as ever to get back into the air, and sought his next best chance to do so in Chicago. After opening a garage for income, he repeatedly applied for the Curtiss-Wright School of Aviation. Robinson was rejected every time, but circumnavigated this roadblock altogether by becoming a janitor on Saturday nights, thereby being able to listen in on the lessons being taught in the evening class at the time. Becoming exposed to like-minded individuals in the subject, Robinson started the Aero Study Group, one that successfully manage to build its own airplane, tested out by the same night teacher whose class Robinson cleaned, Bill Henderson. Impressed by the plane, Henderson got Robinson a slot at the school, and, under the instructions of Mr. Snyder, Robinson became a licensed pilot. Before long, Robinson convinced the school to allow his peers from the Aero Study Group to enroll and become pilots as well. Later, Robinson, along with his friend Cornelius Coffey formed the Challenger Air Pilots Association for African Americans wanting to fly. = Expanding black aviation = Deciding that aviation school should not be closed to African-Americans, Robinson and his friend Cornelius Coffey opened their own airfield in Robbins, Illinois, the John Robinson School of Aviation. To further promote black pilots, Robinson convinced his old college, the Tuskegee Institute, to open up a school of aviation, as soon as funds were available to do so.  Ethiopia  In January 1935, Robinson announced his intentions to volunteer to defend Ethiopia in its ongoing conflict with Italy,. The announcement took place at a meeting of black business owners and community leaders sponsored by the Associated Negro Press (ANP) in Chicago. Dr. Melaku Bayen, a cousin of Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie, became aware of Robinson's announcement and qualifications, and met with Robinson directly. Bayen subsequently made a favorable recommendation for Robinson to Selassie. In April 1935, Selassie wired an official invitation to Robinson offering an officer's commission in Ethiopian. Robinson's decision to accept the commission was based on several factors. First, Robinson and his colleagues were political and military activists motivated to aid Ethiopia as it was threatened by an imperialistic Italy under Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini; and as Ethiopia was non- colonized, it represented the larger idea of a free and independent Africa that Robinson supported. Second, opportunities for black aviators in the United States were limited, particularly in the U.S. Army Air Corps, where all African-Americans were explicitly prohibited from service. Lynchings by white mobs also continued to be common both in Robinson's hometown in Florida as well as in Mississippi. Finally, having already earned recognition for his all-black military aviation unit in Illinois as a part of the National Guard, Robinson was interested in building and maintaining a similar unit in Ethiopia to promote black political consciousness. After arriving in 1935, Robinson initially conducted pilot training at a recently opened officer training school close to Addis Ababa. On 8 August 1935, Robinson was assaulted by fellow aviator Hubert Julian at the Hotel de France in Addis Ababa. Julian, a recognized aviator from Trinidad who volunteered to help develop the Ethiopian Air Corps, was then ordered by the Emperor to leave the country. Soon after the incident, Robinson was then named the commander of the Ethiopian Air Force. The air force consisted of about two dozen aircraft, which included four Potez 25 biplanes, but all of the aircraft were weaponless. Early in his command, Robinson participated in a reconnaissance mission to provide supplies and soldiers from Addis Ababa to Adwa. The Italian invasion began on October 3, 1935. The eventual force totaled to 19 aircraft and 50 pilots. Ethiopian forces, however, were ultimately outmatched by the Italian airforce, who had advantages in experience and in sheer numbers. On May 9, 1936, Italy annexed Ethiopia. Robinson was also a witness to an Italian bombing of the city of Adwa in October 1935. He observed that the city was unprepared for the attack, and resulted in much confusion and residents fleeing to the city outskirts. \\"I saw a squad of soldiers standing in the street dumbfounded, looking at the airplanes. They had their swords raised in their hands,\\" he described. For his service, Robinson received considerable press attention for his service through NBC Radio, the Transradio Press Service, and the Chicago Defender. Robinson returned to the United States in 1936. Contemporary historians also recognize his achievements in Ethiopia. Robinson's documented achievements in Ethiopia are considered to be the catalyst that inspired demands for social equality to allow African-Americans to serve in the U.S. Army Air Corps, and allowed for the organization of the African-American military pilot group, the Tuskegee Airmen, during World War II. Robinson is therefore sometimes referred to as the \\"Father of the Tuskegee Airmen\\".  Later life and death  In 1944, after Ethiopia's liberation by the Allies, Robinson returned to the country to establish a pilot training school. He also played a role in the foundation of Ethiopian Airlines. He died in Addis Ababa on March 27, 1954, from injuries he suffered in a plane crash.  Legacy  Robinson's Aero Club is the subject of the novel, The Challengers Aero Club by Severo Perez.Perez, Severo, The Challengers Aero Club,Los Angeles: Script & Post Script, 2012. On February 19, 2015, a reading garden at the U.S. Embassy in Ethiopia was dedicated to commemorate Robinson's contributions to Ethiopian aviation during and after war with Italy.

It focuses on wealth and income inequality in Europe and the United States since the 18th century. It was initially published in French (as Le Capital au XXIe si√®cle) in August 2013; an English translation by Arthur Goldhammer followed in April 2014.\\"Piketty's Capital: An Economist's Inequality Ideas Are All the Rage\\" by Megan McArdle, Bloomberg Businessweek, May 29, 2014 The book's central thesis is that when the rate of return on capital (r) is greater than the rate of economic growth (g) over the long term, the result is concentration of wealth, and this unequal distribution of wealth causes social and economic instability. Piketty proposes a global system of progressive wealth taxes to help reduce inequality and avoid the vast majority of wealth coming under the control of a tiny minority. However, at the end of 2014, Piketty released a paper where he stated that he does not consider the relationship between the rate of return on capital and the rate of economic growth as the only or primary tool for considering changes in income and wealth inequality. He also noted that is not a useful tool for the discussion of rising inequality of labor income. On May 18, 2014, the English edition reached number one on The New York Times Best Seller list for best selling hardcover nonfiction and became the greatest sales success ever of academic publisher Harvard University Press.Marc Tracy (24 April 2014).

Jahrhundert\\": Einf√ºhrung, Debatte, Kritik , Bertz + Fischer Verlag, Berlin 2014, . Contents The central thesis of the book is that inequality is not an accident, but rather a feature of capitalism, and can only be reversed through state interventionism. The book thus argues that, unless capitalism is reformed, the very democratic order will be threatened. Piketty bases his argument on a formula that relates the rate of return on capital (r) to economic growth (g), where r includes profits, dividends, interest, rents and other income from capital and g is measured as growth of society's income or output. He argues that when the rate of growth is low, then wealth tends to accumulate more quickly from r than from labor and tends to accumulate more among the top 10% and 1%, increasing inequality. Thus the fundamental force for divergence and greater wealth inequality can be summed up in the inequality r > g. He analyzes inheritance from the perspective of the same formula. Income inequality as measured by the income of the top 1% in several countries. Inequality tended to drop in the middle of the century but has increased in the past several decades. The book argues that there was a trend towards higher inequality which was reversed between 1930 and 1975 due to unique circumstances: the two world wars, the Great Depression and a debt-fueled recession destroyed much wealth, particularly that owned by the elite. These events prompted governments to undertake steps towards redistributing income, especially in the post-World War II period. The fast, worldwide economic growth of that time began to reduce the importance of inherited wealth in the global economy. The book argues that the world today is returning towards \\"patrimonial capitalism\\", in which much of the economy is dominated by inherited wealth: the power of this economic class is increasing, threatening to create an oligarchy. Piketty cites novels by Honor√© de Balzac, Jane Austen and Henry James to describe the rigid class structure based on accumulated capital that existed in England and France in the early 1800s. Piketty proposes that a progressive annual global wealth tax of up to 2%, combined with a progressive income tax reaching as high as 80%, would reduce inequality, although he says that such a tax \\"would be politically impossible\\". Piketty believes the growth rate will once again fall below the rate of return, and the twentieth century will be an aberration in terms of inequality Without tax adjustment, Piketty predicts a world of low economic growth and extreme inequality. His data show that over long periods of time, the average return on investment outpaces productivity-based income by a wide margin. He dismisses the idea that bursts of productivity resulting from technological advances can be relied on to return sustained economic growth; we should not expect \\"a more just and rational order\\" to arise based on \\"caprices of technology\\", and return on investment can increase when technology can be substituted for people. Reception The book's exceptional success was widely attributed to \\"being about the right subject at the right time\\", as The Economist put it. Piketty himself recognized that there is a common sense \\"that inequality and wealth in the United States have been widening.\\" The Occupy movement's \\"We are the 99%\\" slogan made talk of inequality \\"the zeitgeist of our age ‚Äì an age of seemingly permanent crisis and austerity,\\" as Adam Booth put it. British author Paul Mason dismissed charges of \\"soft Marxism\\" as \\"completely misplaced\\", noting that Marx described social relations trying to unveil capitalism's inner tendencies, where Piketty solely relies on social categories and historical data. Piketty rather \\"placed an unexploded bomb within mainstream, classical economics,\\" he concludes. Other scholars have built upon Piketty's work, such as historian Walter Scheidel, who concurs with Piketty in his own study of inequality (The Great Leveler, 2017) that the gap will continue to widen as the decades pass, but contends that Piketty's solutions are untenable. =Appraisal= The author Thomas Piketty Paul Krugman called the book a \\"magnificent, sweeping meditation on inequality\\"Paul Krugman (May 8, 2014).

Clive Crook, while being strongly critical of the book, acknowledged that \\"it's hard to think of another book on economics published in the past several decades that's been praised as lavishly\\". In the introduction to the essay collection After Piketty (2017), Piketty is praised for arguing, before Donald Trump's election, that those with property will dominate the twenty-first century political economy and set in motion forces to keep the rate of profit high enough to create plutocracy. =Criticism= Critique of the normative content One strand of critique faults Piketty for placing inequality at the center of analysis without any reflection on why it matters. According to Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf, he merely assumes that inequality matters, but never explains why. He only demonstrates that it exists and how it worsens.Martin Wolf, \\"Capital in the Twenty-First Century, by Thomas Piketty\\", Financial Times, April 15, 2014, . Or as his colleague Clive Crook put it: \\"Aside from its other flaws, Capital in the 21st Century invites readers to believe not just that inequality is important, but that nothing else matters. This book wants you to worry about low growth in the coming decades not because that would mean a slower rise in living standards, but because it might ... worsen inequality.\\" Professor Hannes H. Gissurarson asserts that Piketty is replacing American philosopher John Rawls as the essential thinker of the left. In addition to questioning common measures of wealth distribution, he also criticizes Piketty for being, unlike Rawls, \\"much more concerned with the rich than with the poor\\". Hannes admits that the \\"rapid rise in the income of the super-rich of the world\\" is happening, but doesn't view this trend as being a problem so long as the poor do not get poorer. American right-libertarian George Leef attacked Piketty's work as \\"an apology for the use of state coercion to take property away from some people who supposedly have too much\\", which in the words of Fr√©d√©ric Bastiat he calls \\"legal plunder\\". Diverting more resources from the voluntary, \\"generally efficient\\" private sector and into the coercive, \\"generally inefficient\\" government sector, he says, was a bad trade-off, especially for poorer people. Methodological critique Lawrence Summers criticizes Piketty for underestimating the diminishing returns on capital, which he believes will offset the return on capital and hence set an upper limit to inequality. Summers challenges another of Piketty's assumptions: that returns to wealth are largely reinvested. A declining ratio of saving to wealth would also set upper limits on inequality in society. Of 400 wealthiest Americans in 1982, only one in ten remained on the list in 2012, and an increasing share of wealthiest people have not increased their fortunes. Moreover, top 1% incomes are now mostly salaries, not capital incomes. Most other economists explain the rise of top 1% incomes by globalization and technological change.The Inequality Puzzle, Lawrence H. Summers, Democracy Journal, Issue #33, Summer 2014. James K. Galbraith criticizes Piketty for using \\"an empirical measure that is unrelated to productive physical capital and whose dollar value depends, in part, on the return on capital. Where does the rate of return come from? Piketty never says\\". Galbraith also says: \\"Despite its great ambitions, his book is not the accomplished work of high theory that its title, length and reception (so far) suggest.\\" Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson used the economic histories of Sweden and South Africa to show that social inequality depends much more on institutional factors than Piketty's factors like the difference between rate of return and growth. Cross-country analysis also shows that the top 1%'s share of income does not depend on that difference. The professors write that general laws, which is how they characterize Piketty's postulations, \\"are unhelpful as a guide to understand the past or predict the future because they ignore the central role of political and economic institutions in shaping the evolution of technology and the distribution of resources in a society\\". Paul Romer criticises that while the data and empirical analysis is presented with admirable clarity and precision, the theory is presented in less detail. In his opinion the work was written with the attitude \\"Empirical work is science; theory is entertainment\\" and therefore an example for Mathiness. Lawrence Blume and Steven Durlauf criticized the book in the Journal of Political Economy for being \\"unpersuasive when it turns from description to analysis... Both of us are very liberal (in the contemporary as opposed to classical sense), and we regard ourselves as egalitarians. We are therefore disturbed that Piketty has undermined the egalitarian case with weak empirical, analytical, and ethical arguments.\\" Critique of Piketty's basic concepts German economist Stefan Homburg criticizes Piketty for equating wealth with capital. Homburg argues that wealth does not only embrace capital goods in the sense of produced means of production, but also land and other natural resources. Homburg argues that observed increases in wealth income ratios reflect rising land prices and not an accumulation of machinery. Joseph E. Stiglitz endorses this view, pointing out that \\"a large fraction of the increase in wealth is an increase in the value of land, not in the amount of capital goods\\". This idea is furthered by Matthew Rognlie, then a graduate student at M.I.T., who published a paper in March 2015 with the Brookings Institution that argues that Piketty did not take the effects of depreciation into account enough in his analysis of the growing importance of capital. Rognlie also found that \\"surging house prices are almost entirely responsible for growing returns on capital.\\" Marxist academic David Harvey, while praising the book for demolishing \\"the widely-held view that free market capitalism spreads the wealth around and that it is the great bulwark for the defense of individual liberties and freedoms,\\" is largely critical of Piketty for, among other things, his \\"mistaken definition of capital\\", which Harvey describes as: > ... a process, not a thing ... a process of circulation in which money is > used to make more money often, but not exclusively through the exploitation > of labor power. Piketty defines capital as the stock of all assets held by > private individuals, corporations and governments that can be traded in the > market no matter whether these assets are being used or not.David Harvey > (May 20, 2014). Taking on 'Capital‚Äô Without Marx: What Thomas Piketty misses > in his critique of capitalism. In These Times. Retrieved May 20, 2014. Harvey further argues that Piketty's \\"proposals as to the remedies for the inequalities are na√Øve if not utopian. And he has certainly not produced a working model for capital of the twenty-first century. For that, we still need Marx or his modern-day equivalent\\". Harvey also takes Piketty to task for dismissing Marx's Das Kapital without ever having read it. IMF economist Carlos G√≥es researched the basic thesis put forth by the book - that when the rate of return on capital (r) is greater than the rate of economic growth (g) over the long term, the result is concentration of wealth - and found no empirical support for it; in fact, an opposite trend was identified in 75% of the countries studied in depth. Piketty's response noted, however, that G√≥es used measures of income inequality rather than wealth inequality, and inappropriately took the interest rate on sovereign debt as his index of the rate of return on capital, which makes his results not commensurate with those of Piketty's study. Critique of the proposed measures In a similar vein, philosopher Nicholas Vrousalis faults Piketty's remedies for misconstruing the kind of political \\"counter-agency\\" required to remove the inequalities Piketty criticizes and for thinking that they are compatible with capitalism. Critique of the conventional paradigm Norwegian economist and journalist Maria Reinertsen compares the book to the 2014 book Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics, by Ailsa McKay and Margunn Bj√∏rnholt, arguing that, \\"while Capital in the Twenty-First Century barely touches the boundaries of the discipline in its focus on the rich, Counting on Marilyn Waring challenges most limits of what economists should care about\\". =Allegation of data errors= On May 23, 2014, Chris Giles, economics editor of the Financial Times (FT), identified what he claims are \\"unexplained errors\\" in Piketty's data, in particular regarding wealth inequality increases since the 1970s. The FT wrote in part: > The data ... contain a series of errors that skew his findings. The FT found > mistakes and unexplained entries in his spreadsheets, similar to those which > last year undermined the work on public debt and growth of Carmen Reinhart > and Kenneth Rogoff. The central theme of Prof Piketty's work is that wealth > inequalities are heading back up to levels last seen before the World War I. > The investigation undercuts this claim, indicating there is little evidence > in Prof Piketty's original sources to bear out the thesis that an increasing > share of total wealth is held by the richest few. Piketty wrote a response defending his findings and arguing that subsequent studies (he links to Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman's March 2014 presentation, The Distribution of US Wealth, Capital Income and Returns since 1913) confirm his conclusions about increasing wealth inequality and actually show a greater increase in inequality for the United States than he does in his book.Thomas Piketty (May 23, 2014).

He was the William Powell Mason Professor of Music at Harvard University from 1961 to 1985.John Milton Ward, Harvard Music Department  Biography  Ward's memories of growing up in Oakland included his father John Milton Ward II, a physician, treating survivors of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Ward attended San Francisco Junior College, and then San Francisco State College. He received a Master of Music from the University of Washington in 1942, and a Doctor of Philosophy in 1953 from New York University with a dissertation entitled The 'Vihuela de mano' and its Music (1536-1576). His teachers were Otto Gombosi, Curt Sachs, Gustave Reese and George Herzog, and he took private composition lessons with Darius Milhaud. Prior to Harvard he taught at Michigan State University and the University of Illinois.Anne Dhu Shapiro, editor, Music and Context: Essays for John M. Ward (1985) He married Ruth Neils in 1945 and was predeceased by her in 2004. He died peacefully at home, and is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery, on Harvard Hill. A memorial was held at Harvard University on May 6, 2012, with performances by lutenist Douglas Freundlich and the Pinewoods Morris Men.  Professional work and honors  John Ward was the author of many articles on folk dance and Renaissance music. He also published editions of the Dublin Virginal Manuscript and the lute works of John Johnson. Ward taught at Harvard continuously from 1955 to 1985. Among his course offerings that first year was a seminar, unusual for the time, on Claudio Monteverdi, culminating in a performance of Il ballo delle ingrate in the courtyard of the Fogg Art Museum. His courses would eventually span film music, music in Native American ceremony, Peking opera, Noh and jazz. Several of these were taught in collaboration with his former student and long-time colleague Rulan Chao Pian. Typically, Ward's courses in what he called \\"MOWFAT,\\" or \\"Music Outside the Western Fine Art Tradition,\\" were not named by geographical region but instead combined music with other disciplines: \\"Music and Drama,\\" \\"Music and Ritual.\\" While his interests were wide-ranging, a constant in his own scholarly work and in his teaching was attention to detail, both stylistic and substantive. In 1976 he established Harvard's first formal collection of audio material relating to non-Western music. Initially consisting entirely of commercial and field recordings Ward had acquired in his travels, the Archive of World Music moved to the Eda Kuhn Loeb Music Library in 1992 and continues to develop in support of ethnomusicological research at Harvard. The collection's principal areas of coverage are the musics of the Middle East, Asia and Africa.Elliott Forbes, A Report of Music at Harvard from 1972 to 1990 (1993) Upon retirement John Ward concentrated his energies on building and curating an important collection for Harvard University. Growing from Ward's interest in primary sources for music and ballet, the Ward Collection at Harvard Library reflects a post-structuralist belief in \\"the infinite variability of performance\\":Gordon Hollis, \\"Introduction,\\" in Gordon Hollis, editor, John Ward and his Magnificent Collection (2010) Ward sought to acquire multiple iterations of works, insisting that even apparently identical printings, for instance, could differ in small but significant ways. He sought signs of use, explaining that these show \\"the hand of the performers: how they worked, what was important to them, and even sometimes (if we are lucky) how they adapted the music to their own talents, or contemporary musical styles.\\"Andrea Cawelti, \\"Introduction to the John Milton and Ruth Neils Ward Collections at Harvard University,\\" in Gordon Hollis, editor, John Ward and his Magnificent Collection (2010) Subjects with particularly strong representation in the Ward Collection are music of the French Revolution, the King's Theatre and the Strauss family. One Festschrift, Music and Context: Essays for John M. Ward, edited by Anne Dhu McLucas (n√©e Shapiro), was published by Harvard University immediately upon Ward's retirement in 1985. Another, John Ward and His Magnificent Collection, edited by Gordon Hollis, was published by Golden Legend in 2010. His papers are housed at Harvard University's Houghton Library, where two staff members are employed full-time to catalog Ward Collection materials. The John M. Ward Fellowship in Dance and Music for the Theatre is awarded annually to support visiting fellows in their work with Ward Collection and other materials at Houghton Library.

Several of Tindall's classic works of criticism, including A Reader's Guide to James Joyce and A Reader's Guide to Finnegans Wake are still in print. He wrote a total of thirteen books on UK and Irish writers including Joyce, Dylan Thomas, W. B. Yeats, and Samuel Beckett. Indeed, Tindall nominated Beckett for the Nobel Prize in Literature; Beckett was the 1969 laureate. Born in Vermont, he studied at Columbia, both as an undergraduate and graduate student. Between those courses of study, in 1925 he set off to see Europe. He went to Paris and bought a copy of Joyce's Ulysses ‚Äî then banned in America. By chance, he bought it on June 16, Bloomsday, the day in which all the events in the book take place. He had it rebound as a French novel to carry it through US Customs. That began Professor Tindall's study of and advocacy for Joyce's works in America; in fact, he started teaching Ulysses even before the book was allowed in the US. Therefore, students in his first Ulysses course were forced to read the dean's copy kept secured in the university library. Finally in 1933, the United States District Court in New York City ruled that the novel was not obscene and could be published in America. In January, 1934 Ulysses was finally available legally in the US and no one had to rely on the library copy any more. Professor Tindall's teaching career at Columbia lasted from 1931 to 1971. For four decades, he taught some of the most popular literary criticism courses in the curriculum. He pioneered a method of reading Joyce's most difficult novel Finnegans Wake with a small group of graduate students, everyone adding a bit of their academic knowledge to the task. He called this Reading by Committee, saying that the group brought to it \\"a variety of languages and learning, [and] might do more with the book than I alone, with small learning and less Greek.\\" References  External Links  * Finding aid to William York Tindall papers at Columbia University.

This is in order to remove the incentive some companies may have to reduce their employees' hours in order to avoid the employer healthcare mandate. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's employer mandate is a penalty that will be incurred by employers with more than 50 employees that do not offer health insurance to their full-time workers. This provision was included as a disincentive for employers considering dropping their current insurance plans once the insurance exchanges began operating as an alternative source of insurance. Proponents of the reform law wanted to address the parts of the healthcare system they believed to not be working well, while causing minimal disruption to those happy with the coverage they have. Lawmakers recognized that approximately 80% of Americans already have insurance, of whom 54% (44% of the total population) are covered directly or indirectly through an employer, and 29% (23% of the total population) are covered by the government‚Äîmainly though Medicare and Medicaid. While 73% of the total population reported themselves satisfied with their insurance situation, significant minorities, even among those that reported favorably, had medically-related financial troubles and/or dissatisfaction with aspects of their insurance coverage, especially among the poor and sick. The intent of the employer mandate (along with a grandfather clause in the ACA) is to help ensure that existing employer-sponsored insurance plans that people like will stay in place. As no company with fewer than 50 full-time employees will face this penalty, many are concerned that the employer mandate creates a perverse incentive for business to employ people part-time instead of full-time. Several businesses and the State of Virginia have clarified the contracts of their part-time employees by adding a 29-hour-a-week cap, to reflect the 30-hour threshold for full-time hours, as defined by the law. Some labor market experts claim such shifts are not clearly attributable to the implementation of the ACA: pre-existing, long-term trends in working hours, and the effects of the Great Recession correlate with part-time working hour patterns. The impact of this provision on employers' decision-making is partially offset by other factors: offering healthcare helps attract and retain employees, while increasing productivity and reducing absenteeism; and to trade a smaller full-time workforce for a larger part-time work force carries costs of training and administration for a business. The number of employers with over 50 employees is relatively small, and more than 90% of these already offer insurance, so changes in employer plans from this provision are expected to be small. Workers who do not receive insurance from an employer plan would be able to purchase insurance on the exchanges. Regardless of the rationale for maintaining existing insurance arrangements for those happy with them, most policy analysts (on both the right and left) are critical of the employer mandate provision on the policy merits. They argue that the perverse incentives regarding part-time hours, even if they do not change many existing insurance plans, are real and harmful; that the raised marginal cost of the 50th worker for businesses could limit companies' growth; that the costs of reporting and administration‚Äîthe paperwork for businesses and the state enforcement‚Äîare not worth the trade-off of incentivizing the maintenance of current employer plans; and note that the employer mandate, unlike the individual mandate, is a non-essential part of the law. Some analysts have suggested that an alternate 'pay or play' version of the employer mandate would partially avoid these problems, by instead taxing business that do not offer insurance by a percentage of their payroll rather than using the 50-employee and 30-hour cut-offs. Furthermore, many healthcare policy analysts think it would be better to transition away from the employer- based system to systems (whether state- or market-based) where insurance is more portable and stable, and hence think that it is a bad idea to even try to maintain existing employer insurance systems. The effects of the provision have also generated vocal opposition from business interests and some unions not granted exemptions.\\"Union Letter: Obamacare Will 'Destroy The Very Health and Wellbeing' of Workers\\", The Wall Street Journal, July 12, 2013 Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Save American Workers Act of 2014 would amend the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to redefine \\"full- time employee,\\" for purposes of the mandate requiring employers to provide health care coverage for their employees, as an employee who is employed on average at least 40 hours of service a week (currently, at least 30 hours of service a week). The bill would make this Act applicable to months beginning after December 31, 2013. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Ways and Means on February 4, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 2575 would alter the calculation of the number of full-time equivalent employees for the purposes of determining which employers are subject to penalties under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for not offering health insurance for their employees or for offering insurance that does not meet certain criteria specified in the law. In addition, the legislation would change the definition of \\"full-time employee\\" used for the calculation of those penalties. Specifically, the bill would raise the threshold that defines full-time employment from 30 hours per week under current law to 40 hours per week. Those changes to the employer responsibility requirements of the ACA would reduce the number of employers assessed penalties and lower the penalties assessed against employers that do not offer insurance (or offer insurance that does not meet certain criteria) and that have at least one full-time employee receiving a subsidy through a health insurance exchange. As a result, the largest budgetary effect of H.R. 2575 would be to reduce the amount of penalties collected from employers. As a result of those changes in who would pay penalties and what amounts they would have to pay, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the staff of the United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate that enacting H.R. 2575 would change the sources of health insurance coverage for some people. Specifically, in most years over the 2015-2024 period, the CBO and JCT estimate that the legislation would: :*Reduce the number of people receiving employment-based coverage‚Äîby about 1 million people; :*Increase the number of people obtaining coverage through Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), or health insurance exchanges‚Äîby between 500,000 and 1 million people; and :*Increase the number of uninsured‚Äîby less than 500,000 people. As a consequence of the changes in penalties and in people's sources of insurance coverage, the CBO and JCT estimate that enacting H.R. 2575 would increase budget deficits by $25.4 billion over the 2015-2019 period and by $73.7 billion over the 2015-2024 period. The 2015-2024 total is the net of an increase of $83.0 billion in on-budget costs and $9.3 billion in off-budget savings (the latter attributable to increased revenues). Pay-as-you-go procedures apply because enacting the legislation would affect direct spending and revenues. JCT has determined that H.R. 2575 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The Save American Workers Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on June 28, 2013 by Rep. Todd C. Young (R, IN-9). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Ways and Means. It was reported (amendment) by the committee alongside House Report 113-386. The White House threatened to veto the bill. Debate and discussion Republicans argued that this bill is necessary because the ACA's definition of full-time as 30 or more hours a week has led to some employers reducing employees' hours to under 30, which lowers the paychecks of those workers by as much as 25 percent. Rep. Michael C. Burgess (R-TX) said that the ACA \\"fundamentally changed the labor law in this country, creating a new standard called the 30-hour workweek.\\" He argued that the result of this change was cut hours for workers and cut productivity, calling the whole situation an example of \\"what an onerous government regulation can and will do: suppress innovation and disadvantage our businesses.\\" Burgess also argued that this bill is a small fix to the ACA rather than an attempt to repeal it again. Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-NY) opposed the bill on the basis of the CBO's report, arguing that \\"this legislation would increase the deficit by $74 billion and force 1 million people to lose their sponsored healthcare coverage and increase the number of uninsured.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 2575 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 2575 *GovTrack.us H.R. 2575 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 2575 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 2575 *House Republican Conference's legislative digest on H.R. 2575 *Statement of Obama Administration Policy on H.R. 2575 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Legislation attempting to reform or repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ","title":"Save American Workers Act of 2013"},{"id":"42363319","text":"Haruna Yakubu (born 24 October 1955) is the Vice-Chancellor of University for Development Studies.

Theodorescu (most common rendition of Demetru Theodorescu or Teodorescu, first name also MiticƒÉ; October 26, 1888 ‚Äì April 11, 1946) was a Romanian journalist, humorist, and critic, remembered for his social-themed novels but also for his controversial political stances. A committed opponent of the National Liberal Party establishment, Theodorescu frequented the avant-garde and socialist circles. During World War I, he transformed himself into a supporter of the Central Powers, and lived the occupation of Romania as a collaborationist. Like his friend Tudor Arghezi, he was imprisoned on a verdict of treason, but pardoned in December 1920. Returning to the literary and political press, gravitating between Contimporanul, AdevƒÉrul, and Cuv√¢ntul, Theodorescu radicalized his vision of public affairs. He came to support fascism, and publicly praised the Iron Guard movement before and during World War II. In late 1944, the return of multi-party rule led to his marginalization and public condemnation. Theodorescu's work as a satirical novelist was generally considered an extension of his journalistic polemics, although various critics and historians also made a point of noting the author's literary skill. Comprising three standalone books, but tied together as a \\"Mischianu family\\" saga, it stirred controversy for its political undertones and, in some cases, for its frank eroticism. Biography =Early life= The son of Ion and Aurelia Theodorescu, the future writer hailed from the village of Roe»ôti, in V√¢lcea County, where he was born on October 26, 1888CƒÉlinescu, p.774Ion Simu»õ, \\"Theodorescu, Dem.\\", in Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic»õionarul biografic al literaturii rom√¢ne, Vol. II, Editura Paralela 45, Pite»ôti, 2004, p.706. (some sources have 1889).CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.339; Straje, p.720 A high school student in Craiova, he published poems and philosophical fragments in Ramuri. Between 1900 and 1910, Theodorescu began contributing to the daily press of Bucharest, using such aliases as D.T., D.C.H., D. Chirca and, later on, Todry,Straje, p.193, 194, 720, 721, 726 also enlisting at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Letters. He sent pieces to N. D. Cocea's socialist review, Facla, under the pen name Fidelio (used before him by the literary critic Ilarie Chendi).Straje, p.263, 720 His literary debut was in humorous drama, with the one-act play Domnul Traian Traianescu-Laocoon (\\"Mr. Traian Traianescu-Laocoon\\", 1907).CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.599 Constantin Beldie, Nae Ionescu, Theodorescu and Spiru Hasna»ô, photographed as staff members for Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ (1912) Around 1912, Theodorescu was a sympathizer of the Symbolist movement, the radical side. Alongside journalists Nae Ionescu and Constantin Beldie, he was employed by the literary and art magazine Insula, put out by poets Ion Minulescu and N. Davidescu.Cernat, p.26-28 As assessed by literary historian Paul Cernat, Insula represented Symbolism \\"in revolt\\", \\"segregated\\" from cultural conservatism.Cernat, p.27 Theodorescu and Ionescu wrote collectively or interchangeably on the same satirical column, as Nae & MiticƒÉ.Cernat, p.28; Straje, p.352, 472, 720 Both had as main targets the iconic figures of traditionalism (Alexandru Vlahu»õƒÉ) or moderate aestheticism (Victor Eftimiu, Eugen Lovinescu, Cincinat Pavelescu).Cernat, p.28 In tandem, Theodorescu was co-opted on the staff of Constantin RƒÉdulescu-Motru's Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, where he usually signed his contributions as Ravaillac, Ravaiac, and (presumably) Teo.Straje, p.590, 712, 720-721 He also signed with his name, covering topics such as the British railway strike. \\"Bibliografii. Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ\\", in Tribuna Poporului, September 5, 1911, p.8 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) =World War I controversies= Theodorescu became more politically involved with the outbreak of World War I in 1914. During the early stages of the war, when Romania balanced her neutrality, Theodorescu was working as Chief Editor of the political daily Dreptatea, under patrons Nicolae Fleva and Pache Protopopescu. He pushed the newspaper into a position of full support for the Entente Powers, making use of strong anti-Germanic imagery: \\"Once you meet a German, wring his neck!\\"Boia, p.319 He urged Romania to enter the war on the Central Powers and annex Transylvania, while condemning the Germanophile politicians of the day‚ÄîAlexandru Marghiloman, of the Conservative Party, was a canalie (\\"scoundrel\\"), and Ioan Slavici an \\"enemy of the national ideal\\". During 1915, as the Central Powers gained the upper hand, Dreptatea slowly discarded the Ententist cause, and took a neutralist stance.Boia, p.94, 319 Theodorescu returned with sarcastic comments on Ententists such as Octavian Goga and Take Ionescu, accused of having \\"sold\\" Romania to the Russian Empire. As Toader Chirca, Theodorescu was already contributing articles to Libertatea, the Germanophile sheet managed by Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti; in November 1915, he formalized this affiliation, and resigned from Dreptatea. At Libertatea, and subsequently at Cronica, he became colleagues with poet-journalist Tudor Arghezi, the only one among Libertatea contributors to have proved himself more prolific than Theodorescu, as well as with writers such as Adrian Maniu, Perpessicius, Drago»ô Protopopescu, I. C. Vissarion, and Ion Vinea.Boia, p.103, 319 In the essay Morala cea nouƒÉ, carried by Cronica in May 1916, Theodorescu opined that the German Empire was a model-civilization. In his view, the German order stood to conquer and subdue \\"rampant\\" individualism, thus turning the page on the ideals of the French Revolution.Boia, p.320 Some three months later, a National Liberal government of Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu announced Romania's affiliation to the Entente. This put a stop to Libertatea and Cronica, which went out of print immediately.Boia, p.194 The following moths were chaotic, leading to the invasion of Romania by the Central Powers; Bucharest fell after a month-long attack, but the legitimate government continued to resist the enemy in Moldavia. Others, including Theodorescu and various other Germanophiles, opted to remain in Bucharest. Gazeta Bucure»ôtilor, the collaborationist daily put out by Slavici and Arghezi, enlisted Theodorescu, who contributed there mainly under the pseudonym Ion Olteanu.Boia, p.96, 320 Theodorescu was by then fully committed to the Central Powers and the puppet administration set up by Lupu Kostaki. In August 1917, during what was designed as the final German attack on Moldavia, Gazeta Bucure»ôtilor carried his appeal Pedeapsa (\\"Punishment\\"). It presented the Germans as liberators, noting that \\"our true enemy\\" was the \\"hideous\\" political system set up by Take Ionescu and BrƒÉtianu. His articles turned against high society Francophilia (or Fran»õuzomania, \\"Frenchy-mania\\"), perceived as the real reason for war: \\"Those dames who spoke in French, they have for the large part created Romania's war.\\" Early in 1918, as the state authorities in Moldavia considered alternatives for peace with the Germans, the old Germanophile leader Marghiloman was awarded Premiership. There followed a transitional period, during which Marghiloman negotiated the Buftea Armistice. Although an old rival of Marghiloman's, Theodorescu found himself promoted Chief Editor of the Conservative daily, Steagul, for which he began reusing his old pen name, Fidelio.Straje, p.720 For a while, he was even relocated to Ia»ôi, the former seat of BrƒÉtianu's government, where he served as head of government censorship. =Imprisonment and return= This interregnum came to an abrupt end in November 1918, when the Armistice of Compi√®gne signaled a general defeat for the Central Powers. Marghiloman presented his resignation, leaving his former allies exposed to formal investigations for treason. As D. Ghirca, Theodorescu became staff writer for Pamfil »òeicaru's »öara NouƒÉ, working alongside Cezar Petrescu, Victor Ion Popa, and Gib MihƒÉescu. This newspaper campaigned for an emergent left-wing group, the Peasants' Party, which channeled its efforts into defeating the \\"oligarchic\\" National Liberal establishment.FƒÉnel Todora»ôcu, \\"The Journalistic Path of Pamfil »òeicaru, I.

In March of that year, Theodorescu, Arghezi, Slavici, Saniel Grossman and Dumitru Karnabatt were all taken into custody, pending trial. They stood accused of having placed themselves in direct service to the occupying power, for which Theodorescu received a five- year prison term.Boia, p.339 Theodorescu was also purged from the Romanian Writers' Society, based on the motion of its President, Mihail Dragomirescu.

The monarch responded to pressures from a Transylvanian National and Peasantist government, which mainly saw the sentencing as a political squabble between the National Liberals and their adversaries.Boia, p.344 Theodorescu soon returned to his career in the press, with articles published in Cocea's Rampa and in the illustrated monthly Gloria Rom√¢niei.Ileana-Stanca Desa, Dulciu MorƒÉrescu, Ioana Patriche, Adriana Raliade, Iliana SulicƒÉ, Publica≈£iile periodice rom√¢ne≈üti (ziare, gazete, reviste).

Via»õa »ôi opera, Editura Biblioteca Bucure»ôtilor, Bucharest, 2001, p.184-185, 395. Theodrescu served as editor of both AdevƒÉrul and its supplement Diminea»õa. In June 1922, Theodorescu's former Cronica associate, Vinea, issued the influential magazine Contimporanul. Later a tribune for the artistic avant- garde, it was at the time mainly a political venue with socialist and Peasantist leanings, as evidenced by its original list of contributors: Theodorescu, Arghezi, Eugen Filotti, Benjamin Fondane, Henric Streitman, Nicolae N. Lupu, Camil Petrescu.Cernat, p.132-133 Theodorescu's earliest contribution to the paper was a defense of the Socialist-Communist Party, whose members, affiliates of the Comintern, faced prosecution for dissent (see Dealul Spirii Trial).Cernat, p.132 In 1924, Theodorescu joined the staff of Cuv√¢ntul Liber, Filotti's own newspaper, where he debuted with an article on a major social issue, that of knowledge workers and their payment.\\"»òtiri artistice\\", in Ilustra»õiunea SƒÉptƒÉm√¢nalƒÉ, Nr. 18/1924, p.5 Also in 1924, he became co-editor of Titus Enacovici's Cuv√¢ntul daily, sharing responsibilities with his old friend Nae Ionescu, as well as with Octav Onicescu and Titus Devechi. Ioana P√¢rvulescu, \\"Cuv√¢ntul »ôi cuvintele lui Sebastian\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 30/2009 The newspaper, which, in 1933, became a voice for the antisemitic far right, still styled itself \\"politically independent\\" outlet, employing members of the Jewish Romanian community. At Cuv√¢ntul Liber, Theodorescu embarked on a personal polemic with the far-right intellectual Nichifor Crainic, who, years later, still alleged that Theodorescu was merely \\"a hireling of the Jews\\".Nichifor Crainic, \\"DupƒÉ douƒÉzeci de ani\\", in G√¢ndirea, Nr. 10/1941, p.514 Theodorescu stayed with Cuv√¢ntul after »òeicaru took over as publisher, but he also continued to write for the rival AdevƒÉrul. He solved this conflict of interest by switching to the pen name of Rastignac for his Cuv√¢ntul articles, which reputedly managed to confuse his own colleagues there.Mircea Eliade, Autobiography: 1907-1937, Journey East, Journey West, University of Chicago Press, Chicago & London, 1990, p.120. The AdevƒÉrul publishing venture put out Theodorescu's second novel, Sub flamura ro»ôie (\\"Under the Red Banner\\"), in 1926. He was interviewed by novelist I. Valerian for a 1927 issue of his Via»õa LiterarƒÉ, detailing his previous work in the press.Straje, p.352, 721 =Fascism= By the end of the 1920s, Theodorescu was becoming a political radical. His mounting dissatisfaction with the electoral mores of Romanian liberalism was given voice in a 1929 piece for Contimporanul, where he ridiculed the political marches of the opposition People's Party, as well as the indifference of governing National Liberals. He concluded, sarcastically: \\"Only those who are either Bolshevik or shameless will dare speak with the voters; an honest mind and a true Romanian spirit are well satisfied with the [notion of a] country. This is all the more true if you consider that the electoral corps is something local and petty, whereas 'the country' is something integral, that will only head for Bucharest if promised free food and drink.\\" Dem. Theodorescu, \\"Un banchet ≈üi un program\\", in Contimporanul, Nr. 84/1929, p.1 (digitized by the Babe≈ü-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) He was drifting nonetheless away from the modernist left-wing, as noted by Geo Bogza: \\"AVANT-GARDE! Why does the word frighten you so, Mr. Dem. Theodorescu? Its letters, when counted, are found to be only a quarter of the teeth you're missing.\\"Geo Bogza, \\"Gonococi\\", in Urmuz, Nr. 1/1928, p.4 In 1932, Theodorescu was still a contributor to the leftist press, with articles published in Progresul Social review.\\"CƒÉr»õi‚Äîreviste\\", in AdevƒÉrul, March 24, 1932, p.2 By the end of 1933, Ionescu and Theodorescu's sympathy for the fascist Iron Guard, which had just been outlawed by government, was cemented. In December, they produced a Cuv√¢ntul issue which hosted musings by Guard founder Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, concerning a supposed \\"Judeo-Masonic\\" plot against his movement, as well as homage pieces by both editors, deploring the fate of Guardsmen in police custody. Marta Petreu, \\"Diavolul »ôi ucenicul sƒÉu: Nae Ionescu - Mihail Sebastian\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 13/2008 In 1936, under contract with Alcaly Company, Theodorescu published his third and final novel, Robul (\\"The Slave\\"). That year, he signed a congratulatory telegram to the pro-fascist Stelian Popescu, editor of Universul daily, who had set himself the goal of eradicating Jews from the press.Sebastian, p.80-83 The Jewish writer Mihail Sebastian, his former employee at Cuv√¢ntul, claimed that, in private, Theodorescu was more conciliatory than Popescu. As quoted by Sebastian, Theodorescu declared himself deeply ashamed by the telegram signing, but concluded: \\"What can I do? That's life!\\"Sebastian, p.83 Theodorescu sided with the new establishment after the arrival to power of the fascist National Christian Party, and then after the creation of a National Renaissance Front. According to Sebastian, Theodorescu was taking an active, if informal, part in censoring works by Jewish authors, including Sebastian's own comedies.Sebastian, p.178 His own Robul was translated in 1939 and published in New York City as One House Contains Us All. Married to the actress Marioara Zimniceanu, Theodorescu was working on a translation of the Sardou‚ÄìMoreau comedy Madame Sans-G√™ne, which premiered at the National Theater Bucharest, under the management of novelist Liviu Rebreanu. His text earned critical attention for having updated and adapted the original to Romanian street- language, with direct borrowings from Ion Luca Caragiale. Cicerone Theodorescu, \\"Cronica dramaticƒÉ\\", in Universul Literar, Nr. 4/1938, p.7 (digitized by the Babe≈ü-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) His other works in the field were a free adaptation from Lope de Vega's comedies (Castiliana), and a version of Sardou's F√©dora (1944). His work with Lope's text was controversial: Theodorescu took an exact translation by Alexandru Popescu-Telega and changed it as he had done with Madame Sans-G√™ne, sparking a dispute between theater professionals, with Rebreanu as an arbiter.Nicolae Carandino, \\"Via»õa artisticƒÉ. Spectacole teatrale bucure»ôtene. Moartea lui Danton, Richard II, Dinu PƒÉturicƒÉ, Castiliana\\", in Steaua, Nr. 1/1967, p.85 During 1941, the National Renaissance Front having crumbled, the Iron Guard seized power, creating Romania a \\"National Legionary State\\". Theodorescu was employed as a Romanian Radio propagandist. According to Sebastian's diaries, he had \\"an unbearable style\\", with \\"the same phrases and epithets he used to serve three regimes, [...] now serving a fourth\\", and with \\"clownish\\" undertones.Sebastian, p.321-322 Theodorescu maintained official positions throughout most of World War II and the Ion Antonescu dictatorship, when Romania was allied to Nazi Germany. The King Michael Coup of August 1944 reversed this situation, and restored political pluralism. On October 16, following an investigation carried out by the Romanian Communist Party and the National Peasants' Party, Theodorescu was formally excluded from all professional journalistic bodies. This controversial purge also affected other journalists, many of whom had been active on the far right: »òeicaru, S. Popescu, Crainic, D. I. Cucu, and Romulus Dianu. Z. Ornea, \\"Imaginea unei vremi √Æncr√Æncenate\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 24/2000 The Writers' Society followed suit on November 9, expelling Theodorescu from its ranks Pavel »öugui, \\"G. CƒÉlinescu. Un text cenzurat, Denun»õurile\\", in Caiete Critice, Nr. 1-2-3/2009, p.52 for a second and final time. The marginalization process was interrupted by Theodorescu's death, which occurred on April 11, 1946. He left an unpublished novel inspired by theatrical life, Rita Rizu. Novels Among his novelist colleagues, Rebreanu was fond of Theodorescu's work, citing it as one of the best accomplishments in the field.Felix Aderca, MƒÉrturia unei genera»õii, S. Ciornei, Bucharest, 1929, p.292-293 Reviewer »òerban Cioculescu, of Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, noted that, although \\"the spawn of journalism\\", Theodorescu was \\"a committed writer, who knows how to neatly lay down the issues and then solve them courageously. [...] The objective manner is, in his view, rather stale. Hence, he despises it. He discards impersonal descriptions and the cold dispassion of the social novelist, who has a fear of taking sides.\\"Cioculescu, p.422 Other critics and literary historians were less impressed. George CƒÉlinescu, for instance, notes Theodorescu's works in passing, as \\"entirely journalistic chronicles\\". Octav Botez, literary columnist at Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, spoke of Theodorescu as \\"an astute social analyst\\", but not in fact \\"the sort of spirit who is endowed with the mysterious gift of creation.\\"Botez, p.319 √én cetatea idealului was part of a family of political novels specifically dealing with the social and moral upheavals of the 1910s, standing alongside N. Davidescu's Conservator & Comp., and Eugen Todie's H√ÆrdƒÉul lui Satan (\\"Satan's Bucket\\").Botez, p.318 In writing it, Theodorescu took revenge on his political opponents of World War I.CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.339 As noted by culture critic Eugen Lovinescu, the book is seasoned with irony, which is \\"an admirable weapon when it comes to clashes of ideas\\", but \\"a dissolving factor in matters of creativity\\".Lovinescu, p.199 Critic Ovid CrohmƒÉlniceanu also describes the narrative as \\"tiresome\\", with its \\"vulgarity and lampoonish overbidding.\\" Contrarily, journalist Nicolae Carandino sees it as \\"one of the best Romanian novels\\". At core, the novel is about the game of wits between two aristocratic women: Sofia Mihailidis, the Francophile, and Ang√®le Mischianu, her Germanophile rival. Francophile commitments appear to be a tool for the spoils system: Mihailidis pushes her lover, the demagogue Titi Niculcea, for the position of government minister. A plot twist occurs when Mihailidis opts to stay behind in occupied Bucharest, trying to convince Niculcea, by then a military officer, to desert with her.CƒÉlinescu, p.774; CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.339 The secondary plots are more \\"lively\\", according to Lovinescu: \\"we only retain here the profile of one Gonciu [...], the unmissable, but also selfless, partaker in all high life events, an encyclopedic dictionary of all things scientific, a genealogist and heraldist, an arbiter of taste, who, late at night, after having participated in the most 'selective' reunions of the grand salons, unbeknown to all, sinks back into his distant mahala, by the Sf√¢nta Vineri Cemetery, and into the home of his mother, a laundress\\".Lovinescu, p.199-200 Sub flamura ro»ôie expands on the Mischianu saga, recounting events set to the backdrop of the general strike of 1920. As argued by Lovinescu, there is \\"visible progress\\", with almost no irony discernable in the narrator's voice.Lovinescu, p.200 In the main plot, Vasile Stancu, the labor organizer and anticapitalist orator, is shot at by an erstwhile socialist admirer, Firina, whom Vasile has raped. The murder attempt is accidentally discovered by a high society houri, Roxana Mischianu, who is infatuated with Vasile and follows him in his missions abroad, while Firina, no longer in control of her actions, turns to political assassination. The socialist movement is half-compromised, with Stancu arrested upon his return to the country, then isolated in VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti prison.Botez, passim; »òƒÉineanu, p.160-163. See also CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.339-340 He is made to defend himself in a lengthy trial which ends with his acquittal, but finds that Roxana has deserted both him and the cause.Botez, p.318; »òƒÉineanu, p.161-162 Lovinescu describes the work as \\"interesting\\", with \\"a portraitist's vigor\\", but rejects the subplot, which focuses on renewed erotic clashes between the Mischianus and the Mihaildises. This, he argues, is the stuff of \\"licentious engravings\\", not literature. The same was noted by Botez. He finds the text to be \\"nervous and personal\\", with a \\"relentless verve\\" and \\"intelligent and judicious remarks\\" about socialist ideology; however, the erotic scenes seem to him \\"gross and obscene.\\" Critic Constantin »òƒÉineanu also gave a rather positive review to the narrative, praising Theodorescu for conjuring an \\"intense emotion\\" by means of the central love story.»òƒÉineanu, p.159-160 He also notes that, stylistically, Sub flamura ro»ôie is a failure: \\"[Theodorescu] has made pointless efforts to pour in all sorts of adjectives and belabored expressions, with convoluted phrases, bizarre neologisms and with risky images and comparisons that defy common sense and wear out the most benevolent of his patient readers.\\"»òƒÉineanu, p.162 As CrohmƒÉlniceanu notes, the \\"concupiscent\\" imagery adds a \\"sensationalist tint\\".CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.340 The book was especially unpopular among literary men affiliated with either the Social Democrats or the Romanian Communist Party. Socialismul newspaper complained that Theodorescu painted a grim picture of Romanian socialism, showing Stancu as bereft \\"of one's basic spiritual qualities\\".Traian Vlad, \\"Note marginale\\", in AdevƒÉrul, August 26, 1926, p.1 The communist party organ Cultura ProletarƒÉ gave Sub flamura ro»ôie a poor review, objecting to its depiction of socialist men undone by sheer erotic instinct. This perspective, the reviewers wrote, showed Theodorescu as a \\"petty bourgeois\\", unreceptive of revolutionary idealism, but \\"overly familiar with the world of horse-racing, hags, and prostitutes\\".CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.146 Other figures on the left, such as Contimporanul editor Ion Vinea, contrarily cherished Theodorescu as an anti-bourgeois from the same ideological family as Vasile Demetrius or Panait Istrati.Cernat, p.74 The former socialist Constantin Mille also admired the novel's \\"verve\\". Robul is an attack on modern democracy, but, as Lovinescu argues, generally objective in tone‚Äîinstead of editorial commentary, it satirizes by creating hardly credible situations. It thus shows influences from Arghezi's lampoons, and not to the \\"flowing style\\" of N. D. Cocea's novels. The eponymous \\"slave\\" is Nicolin, a starving war invalid who takes up the job of ghostwriting for the career politician Obogea. As a result, the profiteering Oblogea becomes a rising star, whereas Nicolin lives in anonymity, his only real friend a former prostitute, Margot; Elvira Obogea, the object of Nicolin's final passion, leaves him for the sporty Raul Mischianu.Cioculescu, p.422-424. See also CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p.340 Again, the novel alludes to real events: the Great Depression, the Bucharest war invalids' march, and its violent repression. These events, Cioculescu notes, are poorly narrated, as are political and social themes (Theodorescu's depiction of the \\"sociogenic\\" mass and its passion for sports).Cioculescu, p.423-424 Notes References *Lucian Boia, \\"Germanofilii\\".

Life and career  Blaisdell was born in Newport, Rhode Island in 1927, and grew up in Quincy, Massachusetts. He sketched and built models since early childhood, and eventually attended the New England School of Art and Design in Boston. Following his graduation, he married his wife Jackie and they moved to California, where he worked for Douglas Aircraft; on the side, he drew artwork for various science fiction magazines, eventually meeting noted literary agent - and founding creative director/editor of the long-running monster magazine Famous Monsters of Filmland - Forrest J Ackerman, who ended up becoming his agent. In 1955, Blaisdell was hired to create the creature effects for Roger Corman's low- budget film The Beast with a Million Eyes, after which he spent several years designing the monsters for a number of B movies, earning a reputation for working quickly and cheaply. In many cases, he was also the actor portraying the respective creature on screen. However, after a few years, he became disenchanted with the business. Blaisdell, together with film editor/archivist/actor Bob Burns, formed the company Black Shield, to publish the Famous Monsters-inspired magazine Fantastic Monsters Of The Films for seven issues during 1962-63, for which Jim Harmon and Ron Haydock edited and wrote text. He gave up on the magazine when the plates for the eighth issue were destroyed in a fire at his printers. Eventually he quit all involvement in movie culture to work as a carpenter instead.

The manor is grade II listed by Historic England. History It was recorded in the Domesday Book as a monastery. The monastery was dissolved by Henry VIII and by 1580 was owned by William Morgan. William's son, John was knighted at Cadiz in 1596. Sir Ernest Randyll, whose family held Chilworth for over a century, married John's daughter. During the time when Chilworth Manor was owned by the Randylls, the South front was built. This is the earliest recognisable part of the Manor - the architect is unknown. Morgan Randyll was MP for Guildford from 1680 to 1712. As a result of the costs involved in the Elections, the property was sold to Richard Houlditch, a director of the South Sea Company. After losses involved with the 1720 South Sea Bubble, the manor was again sold. In 1725 the widowed Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, became the owner. She added the Marlborough Wing, developed a tiered garden excavated in the sloping hillside and still known as the \\"Duchess's Garden\\". It then passed from her grandson, John Spencer, through inheritances to the Dukes of Northumberland who held it until the 1930s. It was then acquired by Alfred Mildmay who carried out major renovations to the building. Walls of Chilworth Manor garden Sir Lionel and Lady Heald bought the manor in 1945 and lived there for over 60 years. Elected MP for Chertsey in 1950, he was Attorney-General in Churchill's post-war government. She worked for many charitable causes including the National Garden Scheme of which she was chairwoman. Since Lady Heald's death in 2004 extensive restoration work has been carried out and the garden, fittingly, opened as part of the National Garden Scheme. In popular culture John Bunyan, who lived nearby at one time, is reputed to have based The Hill of Difficulty in Pilgrims Progress on the path from the manor to St Martha's Chapel. The house has been featured in a number of films and TV series over the years. =Films= *The Passionate Stranger (1957) *I Don't Speak English (1995) *Sliding Doors (1998) *Parting Shots (1998) *The Wedding Date (2005) =TV= *Just William - Boys will be Boys (1995) *Daniel Deronda (2002) *Foyles War - The Funk Hole (2003) *Agatha Christie's Marple - A Murder is Announced (2005) *Agatha Christie's Poirot - Taken at the Flood (2006) References Category:Country houses in Surrey Category:Gardens in Surrey Category:Grade II listed buildings in Surrey ","title":"Chilworth Manor, Surrey"},{"id":"42363695","text":"The history of Koreans in Baltimore dates back to the mid-20th century. The Korean-American community in Baltimore began to grow in the 1960s and reached its peak between the 1970s and 1990s. The Korean population is anchored in central Baltimore, particularly the neighborhoods of Charles North and Charles Village, a portion of which has an historic Koreatown. Since the 1990s, the Korean-American population has decreased due to suburbanization, with many Korean-Americans settling in nearby Howard County. Demographics The Korean American community in Baltimore, Maryland numbered 1,990 as of 2010, making up 0.3% of Baltimore's population. At 93,000 people, the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington metropolitan area has the third largest Korean American population in the United States. The Baltimore metropolitan area is home to 35,000 Koreans, many of whom live in suburban Howard County, particularly Columbia and Ellicott City. As of 2000, the Korean language is spoken at home by 3,970 people in Baltimore. History Korean-American food stalls at Lexington Market, May 2009 The Korean-American population in Baltimore first exceeded 100 people in the 1960s. Prior to the 1960s, few Koreans settled in the city. Almost no Koreans immigrated to Baltimore between 1883 and 1950. Koreans first started appearing in Baltimore in large numbers after the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 was passed, which abolished the national origin and racial quota system. By 1978, Koreans were the largest Asian-American group in the city. The new law encouraged the immigration of skilled Korean workers, including mechanics and engineers for the city's industries. Many Korean immigrants founded groceries, dry cleaners, and other mom and pop businesses. The Korean immigrant community in the city was the most solid from the 1970s until the 1990s, after which urban flight led many Koreans to settle in surrounding counties, particularly Howard County. A cluster of Korean restaurants still exist in the lower part of Charles Village, north of the location of the first Korean grocery in Baltimore (the Far East House). The community numbered 17,987 as of 2000, making up 0.7% of Baltimore's population. At that time Koreans were the largest non-white group in Baltimore after African-Americans. In 2004, Korea was the fifth highest country of birth for new residents of Baltimore. As of September 2014, immigrants from Korea were the seventh largest foreign-born population in Baltimore and the Korean language was the fifth most spoken language after English. Institutions The Korean-American Grocers & Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland, Inc. () or KAGRO of Maryland assists Korean-American business owners. In 1995 the organization launched a program that gives $1000 scholarships to students.Owens, Donna M. \\"Korean-American grocers celebrate students' success.\\" The Baltimore Sun. March 31, 2012. Retrieved on September 4, 2014. The new \\"Transform Baltimore\\" Zoning Code, was passed by the City Council and was signed into law on December 5, 2016. The new \\"Transform Baltimore\\" Zoning Code affected approximately 90 Korean owned liquor stores in Baltimore. In response, Julian Min, a political activist organized and founded The Asian-American Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland, Inc., or ALBA. Jong-ho Lee, a businessman, owner of Penn Liquors on Greenmount Ave., served as 1st president of ALBA. Race relations Koreans in Baltimore report anti-Korean bigotry from the city government and African-Americans. Cultural differences and language barriers, resulting in lack of communication and collaboration, have contributed to animosity between African-Americans and Koreans. At the city- owned Lafayette Market, the government cancelled the leases of Korean shop- owners in order to increase the number of African-American shop-owners, a move that has been accused of being discriminatory to Koreans. Race relations between African-Americans and Korean-Americans were tense during the 1990s. African-Americans mistreatment by Korean migrants and believed that Korean grocery stores were selling poor quality food. Korean-Americans feared for their personal safety after a rash of robberies and murders against Koreans and questioned whether these crimes were racially motivated. Tensions between the two communities reached a boiling point after a mostly African-American jury acquitted an African-American who was accused of the robbery and murder of a Korean college student. Representatives of the Korean community filed complaints with the Maryland Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, accusing the city government and law enforcement of failing to protect Koreans and Korean businesses. In response to these complaints, African-American and Korean community leaders sought ways to better race relations and the city government expanded language services and other outreach to Koreans. Under federal law, Baltimore city government and law enforcement are now required to offer language services to Korean speakers. () Many Koreans are distrustful of the government. Language barriers, lack of political representation, fear of retaliation when criminal court cases fall apart, and lack of police response contributes to distrust for the criminal justice system. In 2012, a proposed change in the city's zoning laws made many Korean shop-owners worry that they could be put out of business. Koreans own most corner liquor stores in Baltimore and many feel that they have been unfairly targeted by city government. Over 40 years ago, in 1971, many dozens of liquor stores were grandfathered into city zoning changes. Proposed changes in zoning laws could strip many of these Korean-owned stores of their licenses. If the zoning law were passed, liquor stores with grandfathered licenses would be forced to stop selling liquor within two years, sell their liquor license to someone else, or move their business to an area zoned for liquor. In response, several dozen Korean grocery and liquor store owners have alleged they are being unfairly targeted. A law proposed in 2012 that would ban youths from buying any items from liquor stores was alleged to be racist against Koreans by the Korean-American Grocers & Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland. The legal adviser for the association compared the law to 19th century Chinese Laundry Laws which were used to close down Chinese-owned businesses in San Francisco. Following the death of Freddie Gray, many Korean- owned stores in Baltimore were damaged or looted during the 2015 Baltimore riot. Of the 380 businesses damaged or looted by the rioters, 100 of them were owned by Korean-Americans. Despite the riots costing Korean-American business owners approximately 2 million dollars in damages, some stores have reopened with the fundraising efforts from Julian Min, a political activist and other Korean-American fundraisers. While Baltimore has a history of racial tension between African-Americans and Korean-Americans, some Korean-Americans such as Eunhae Gohng believe that Korean-owned stores were targeted for economic rather than racial reasons. In response to the damage caused by the riots to Korean-American businesses, a performance titled \\"Bmore Seoul to Soul\\" was held in the Station North Arts and Entertainment District featuring both African-American and Korean-American dancers in an attempt to relieve tensions between the two communities. Koreatown There is a small portion of lower Charles Village, (officially referred to as the Station North Arts and Entertainment District, that is sometimes referred to as Koreatown or Little Korea and is home to a number of Korean restaurants, but it has not been officially designated as a Koreatown. This informal Koreatown is bound on the north by 24th Street, on the south by North Avenue, on the west by Maryland Avenue, and on the east by St. Paul Street. In 2017, Julian Min was appointed as Director of International Affairs, where he advocated for Koreatown in Baltimore to attract and retain Korean-American owned businesses. Culture An annual Korean Festival is held at Baltimore's War Memorial Plaza every September. The festival is organized by the Korean Society of Maryland and has been held for over 35 years. Many Baltimore Koreans are Christians. There are over 40 Korean churches in the Baltimore area. Health Koreans in Baltimore are an under-served population and many lack access to healthcare. This lack of access to healthcare has been an ongoing problem for the city's Korean community. According to one study, only 40% of Koreans received healthcare when they needed it and 86% who did obtain healthcare had difficulties doing so, primarily due to language barriers. In response to these difficulties, the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing and Julian Min, a philanthropist helped found the Korean Resource Center, a non-profit community-based education and research foundation in order to mobilize resources in the Korean community and aid elderly Koreans.. In 1999, the Baltimore Metropolitan Korean Senior Center was founded in order to focus on the needs of elderly Koreans in Baltimore, offering English language courses, daily lunches, field trips, and healthcare aid.

Expectation confirmation theory (alternatively ECT or expectation disconfirmation theory) is a cognitive theory which seeks to explain post-purchase or post-adoption satisfaction as a function of expectations, perceived performance, and disconfirmation of beliefs. The structure of the theory was developed in a series of two papers written by Richard L. Oliver in 1977 and 1980. Although the theory originally appeared in the psychology and marketing literatures, it has since been adopted in several other scientific fields, notably including consumer research and information systems, among others. Theoretical constructs Expectation confirmation theory involves four primary constructs: expectations, perceived performance, disconfirmation of beliefs, and satisfaction. =Expectations= Expectations refer to the attributes or characteristics that a person anticipates or predicts will be associated with an entity such as a product, service, or technology artifact. Expectations are posited to directly influence both perceptions of performance and disconfirmation of beliefs, and are posited to indirectly influence post- purchase or post-adoption satisfaction by way of a mediational relationship through the disconfirmation construct. Pre-purchase or pre-adoption expectations form the basis of comparison against which the product, service, or technology artifact is ultimately judged. = Perceived performance= Perceived performance refers to a person‚Äôs perceptions of the actual performance of a product, service, or technology artifact. According to expectation confirmation theory, perceptions of performance are directly influenced by pre-purchase or pre-adoption expectations, and in turn directly influence disconfirmation of beliefs and post-purchase or post-adoption satisfaction. Perceived performance is also posited to indirectly influence post-purchase or post-adoption satisfaction by way of a mediational relationship through the disconfirmation construct. = Disconfirmation of beliefs= Disconfirmation of beliefs refers to the judgments or evaluations that a person makes with respect to a product, service, or technology artifact. These evaluations or judgments are made in comparison to the person‚Äôs original expectations. When a product, service, or technology artifact outperforms the person‚Äôs original expectations, the disconfirmation is positive, which is posited to increase post-purchase or post-adoption satisfaction. When a product, service, or technology artifact underperforms the person‚Äôs original expectations, the disconfirmation is negative, which is posited to decrease post-purchase or post-adoption satisfaction (i.e., to increase dissatisfaction). =Satisfaction= Post-purchase or post-adoption satisfaction refers to the extent to which a person is pleased or contented with a product, service, or technology artifact after having gained direct experience with the product, service, or artifact. Expectation confirmation theory posits that satisfaction is directly influenced by disconfirmation of beliefs and perceived performance, and is indirectly influenced by both expectations and perceived performance by means of a mediational relationship which passes through the disconfirmation construct.

Krivnya is picturesquely situated in the valley of the Beli Lom River in the western part of the Ludogorie located in the hilly Danubian Plain (Bulgaria). The village is surrounded by rock formations, among which the river meanders and divides the village into two parts. In the past the river flowed slowly making a big curve and forming a sort of peninsula. In the last century (1959) an artificial correction of the riverbed is made by using of explosions and the rock formation is \\"cut.\\" Today this place is known as \\" Prosyakata.\\" The altitude of the area ranges between 100 and 200 meters. Relief, except the rocky formations around the river is favorable for agriculture. The climate is continental with hot summers and cold winters. The village is located 3 km from the Ruse-Varna railway line and between the towns of Vetovo and Senovo, Ruse Province.

There are many remains of ancient settlements where many archaeological artifacts are found. In the vicinity of the village is the fortress \\"Sin Grad\\". A part of the foundations of the city walls is preserved today. Some pottery from Roman and Byzantine times is found in this place. There are also traces of an ancient settlement with a shrine for the worship of Heros (Thracian horseman). Some rock churches and monasteries found in this area like for example \\"Chekartsa\\" and \\"Chesnova kanara\\" date from the time of Bulgarian medieval. On the wall of one of the rock churches in the place known as \\"Shanlak kanara\\" in the town of Senovo there is an inscription: \\"Says pop Peya from Krivinu\\". One of the cells of the former cloister in \\"Chakarskata kanara\\" near the village of Krivnya has an inscription: \\"Written by pop Peya\\". According to different experts, the two inscriptions were written by one hand and are dated from the second half of the 14th century. Krivina is the old name of Krivnya so called because of the curves, which Beli Lom River makes. In documents from the 16th and 17th centuries the village is known with the names Kirivina and Kirvine. In 1876 Bulgarian revolutionary Tanyo Voivoda passed through these lands with his squad. Karel ≈†korpil (1859-1944) a Czech-Bulgarian archaeologist and researcher - one of the founders of Bulgarian archeology explored these places in the late 19th century. He made a detailed description of the ruins along the Beli Lom River including those located in the vicinity of the village of Krivnya.  Places of interest  Sin Grad Fortress: Also known as \\"Kaleto\\" is located five kilometers northwest of the village Krivnya. The fortress is accessible through a dirt road and trail. The area has been studied by archaeologists. Remnants of the old settlement and ceramics from the Roman and Byzantine times are found here. In the lower part of the fortress foundations of early Christian churches can be seen. There are also remains of an ancient settlement from the 4th century.

After many failed attempts by others,Chasing Cave Dog by Dan England his record was finally broken after 15 years by Andrew Hamilton.Fastest Known Time Webpage, This website keeps an up- to-date database of many speed records for climbing and hiking. Keizer also has held speed records for the New York Adirondack 46 High Peaks, the New York Catskills 35, the New Hampshire White Mountain Four Thousand Footers and The Barkley.www.thedogteam.com, Details about some of the hiking speed records Keizer holds can be found here. Keizer has appeared in multiple national media outlets including the New York Times and the Outdoor Life Network. Background Keizer grew up in Coos Bay, Oregon.Teddy Keizer: Oregon Trail Blazer, by Jess Lord & Andrea Nuneviller His family enjoyed outdoor adventures such as hiking and skiing.My Interview with Teddy Keizer, Several facts referenced in this article come from the listed interview. Keizer attended and graduated from Brown University with degrees in Political Science and Biology. Hiking and climbing speed records After graduating from college, Keizer had the option of moving to Washington, D.C. to work as a staffer in Patrick Kennedy's office. However, friends convinced him that he needed more real world experience if he wanted to be an effective politician. Keizer spent the next several years traveling around the United States taking a variety of jobs so that he could better understand how people live. During his travels he moved to Crested Butte, Colorado to work at the Grand Butte Hotel as an accountant. Since he was only working a few hours each week, Keizer made a minimal amount of money and slept in snow caves to reduce his expenses. At that time, one of his good friends went by the name Scurvy Dog. Because of his connection to Scurvy Dog and habit of sleeping in snow caves, Keizer got the nickname Cave Dog, by which he is still commonly referred to. =Mighty Mountain Megamarathon= While working at the Grand Butte, Keizer learned about Colorado's highest set of peaks that sit at or above 14,000 feet above sea level. These peaks are commonly referred to as '14ers. Keizer also learned about the Mighty Mountain Megamarathon, in which a climber attempts to summit all of the Colorado 14ers in the least amount of time. The Mighty Mountain Megamarathon requires climbers to summit each peak under his or her own power and also ensures a certain amount of vertical elevation is gained for each summit. Keizer gained an interest in making an attempt to break the Mighty Mountain Megamarathon record and began planning and training for the race in 1998. During his preparations, Keizer consulted with well-known Colorado mountaineer Gerry Roach, who detailed commonly used routes others had used when attempting the record. Keizer climbed extensively in preparation for his record attempt, summiting 14ers over 200 times before attempting the record in 2000. In addition to route planning and physical training, Keizer spent much of his effort laying out detailed driving directions to and from each trailhead. In early September 2000, Keizer, with the help of his team (known as the ‚ÄòDog Team'), set out to break the Mighty Mountain Megamarathon record. During his record-breaking attempt, Keizer unintentionally fell asleep on the trail three times. Despite these minor setbacks, Keizer completed the Megamarathon and broke the record with a time of 10 days, 20 hours, and 26 minutes. Keizer's final peak during the record breaking run was Long's Peak, which is also the last time he ever summited a 14er. =Other hiking speed records= After breaking the Mighty Mountain Megamarathon record, Keizer attempted to break several other speed hiking records. He was able to achieve new speed records for the New York Adirondack 46 High Peaks, the New York Catskills 35 and the New Hampshire White Mountain Four Thousand Footers.

It was restored to operating condition by the Lake Superior Railroad Museum from 2011-2017 and now operates in excursion service on the North Shore Scenic Railroad. History It was built for the Duluth, Missabe, and Northern Railway as number 332; one of 32 locomotives of the C3 class built between 1905 and 1907. In 1937 it passed to the Duluth, Missabe, and Iron Range Railway on the merger of the DM&N; with the Duluth and Iron Range Rail Road. In 1955 locomotives 332 and 348 (also a C3) were sold to the Duluth & Northeastern and renumbered 28 and 27 respectively. D&NE; 28 saw regular service on the D&NE; between Cloquet, Saginaw, and Duluth, Minnesota. It was one of only five remaining steam locomotives for the D&NE; by 1964, when dieselization was eliminating the use of steam. D&NE; retained #28 and used it for only special excursions until 1965. It was then put in storage in Cloquet. In 1974, the locomotive was cleaned, repainted, and donated to the Lake Superior Railroad Museum. There it was on static display until December 2011 when the locomotive was returned to Cloquet for restoration until 2014 when it was returned to Duluth to complete its restoration. Sister engine D&NE; 27 is displayed at the Carlton County Fairgrounds, Barnum, Minnesota, while DM&N; 347 (another C3 locomotive) is displayed at the Museum of Mining, Chisholm, Minnesota. Some parts from the D&NE; #27 were used in the operational restoration of D&NE; #28 in Duluth. D&NE; #28's restoration was completed in the spring of 2017, operating for the first time in over 50 years. Historical significance Duluth & Northeastern #28 was the last steam locomotive to operate in regular service on a railroad in Minnesota. D&NE; 28 is one of four surviving C3 2-8-0s and the only one in operating condition. Restoration D&NE; 28 operating in Palmers, MN. 2017. D&NE; 28 was already being restored (supposedly cosmetically at first) by Cloquet Terminal Railroad when it was announced by the Lake Superior Railroad Museum in March 2014 that the 28 would be restored to operating condition, and would pull excursions on the North Shore Scenic Railroad. \\"Fire up the 28\\" fundraiser was held in order to pay the $11,700 needed for boiler flues which are required for operation. Within a week, the museum had raised over half the required funds. By April, the total amount of funds raised was well over $15,000, more than enough to cover the cost of its restoration. The extra funds are to be used in maintaining and operating the locomotive. The total cost of the restoration was in excess of $750,000 and thousands of volunteer hours. There were few factors that made #28 a good choice for operational restoration. One, the engine was retired in 1965 in operating condition. Two, the engine was stored indoors to protect it from vandalism and weather. And three, the engine was kept on display indoors for the entire time it was at the museum. In the summer of 2014, Cloquet Terminal Railroad ended its part in the restoration process due to management changes. On August 27, 2014, the flues for #28 arrived at the Lake Superior Railroad Museum from Germany. It was then decided that 28 would return to the Lake Superior Railroad Museum to complete its restoration with the installation of the flues. On February 3, 2015, #28 was moved back to the Lake Superior Railroad Museum via BNSF Railway to complete its restoration. The remainder of the restoration included boiler flue installation, insulation & jacketing, as well as repainting. By the end of spring 2015, new metalwork had been installed in the smoke-box and outside the cab. The pilot, running gear, and hand-grabs had been painted. Work on flue installation by Fraser Shipyards began November 17, 2015, and was completed on December 26, 2015. The 28's wheels were given clearance by the FRA a few months later. In March 2016, the brass and cab water-level meters were reinstalled, the super-heater tubes were being reassembled for installation, and the blow-down valves were sent to Colorado for rebuilding. The hydro-test was scheduled for July 13, 2016. The FRA report was filed on July 20, 2016, stating the locomotive passed the test. The cab was painted black with red windows in June. The smoke box front was being installed in early August. Insulation and lagging and a new boiler jacket were supplied to the museum to finish locomotive assembly at no charge. Insulation was installed on the boiler beginning August 12, according to the North Shore Scenic Railroad's Facebook page. The FRA officially began its 15-year or 1,472 days inspection period on November 4, 2016. By January, the locomotive's jacketing had been installed and painted, and its headlight was restored. The #28 had a successful test fire April 3 and 4th, with a few last minute touches (such as painting the steam dome) to be completed. A final test fire occurred in June.  Excursion service  Completion of the restoration was April/May 2017. The 28 underwent successful test runs in April and May. The first excursions of the 28 took place June 10 and 11, 2017. These two excursions, for donors to the restoration project, operated from the Duluth Union Depot to Palmers, Minnesota roughly 16 miles up the former DM&IR;, tracks once used by the 28 in regular service. Regular steam excursions to the general public were announced, a total of 27 excursions in 2017. Excursions will be split between Palmers, on Sundays, and Two Harbors on Fridays and Saturdays. DN&E; 28 did not run in 2018 in order for the museum to improve the locomotive's condition, it is scheduled to operated on several weekends in 2019. For the 2019 operating season, the D&NE; 28 was restored as DM&IR; 332\\\\. On July 19, 2019 DM&IR; 332 (D&NE; 28) met Union Pacific 4014 during a \\"festival of steam\\" hosted by the museum to welcome the \\"Big Boy\\" to Duluth as it made its Midwest tour. The 332 operated excursions on July 20 & 21 while the UP 4014 was displayed at the museum alongside D&NM; 14 and Soo Line 2719.

On the morning of 27 March, ISIL attacked the town, which was being held by the al-Nusra Front. ISIL managed to force al-Nusra to withdraw to the town's hospital and the mountain overlooking Markada. Before dawn on 29 March, clashes erupted in the town as ISIL attacked the hospital and al-Nusra positions in the mountain. After heavy fighting that left 43 al-Nusra and 13 ISIL fighters dead, ISIL took full control of the town as al-Nusra forces retreated towards the town of al-Sour in the eastern rural area of Deir ez-Zor province. Many al-Nusra fighters were also captured. Among those killed was also the top provincial ISIL commander, Omar al-Farouk al-Turki. On 31 March, al-Nusra launched a counterattack in an attempt to recapture the town. By this time, the number of those killed since the start of the fighting had risen to 120.

The Rahlfs-No. is 802. Palaoegraphycally it dates from the first century BCE. Currently the manuscript is housed in the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem.  Description  This scroll is in a very fragmented condition. Today it consists of 97 fragments. However, only 31 of those fragments can be reasonably reconstructed and deciphered, allowing for a reading of Leviticus 1.11 through 5.25; the remaining fragments are too small to allow for reliable identification. Additionally, space bands are occasionally used for the separation of concepts, and divisions within the text. A special sign (‚åê) for separation of paragraphs is found fragment 27, between the lines 6 and 7. While the later divisions would label these verses 5:20-26, it appears to testify to a classical transition from chapter 5 to 6. Skehan dated 4Q120 to \\"late first century BCE or opening years of the first century CE\\". Scriptio continua is used throughout. Text according to A. R.

Patrick W. Skehan suggests that, in the Septuagint version of the Pentateuch, this is more original than the of editions based on later manuscripts, and he assumes that, in the books of the prophets, the Septuagint did use to translate both (the tetragrammaton) and (Adonai), the word that traditionally replaced the tetragrammaton when reading aloud.Martin R√∂sel, Tradition and Innovation: English and German Studies on the Septuagint (SBL Press 2018), p. 295 Emmanuel Tov claims the use here of as proof that the \\"papyrus represents an early version of the Greek scripture\\" antedating the text of the main manuscripts. He states that \\"the writing of the Tetragrammaton in Hebrew characters in Greek revisional texts is a relatively late phenomenon. On the basis of the available evidence, the analysis of the original representation of the Tetragrammaton in Greek Scriptures therefore focuses on the question of whether the first translators wrote either or .\\"Emanuel Tov, Hebrew Bible, Greek Bible and Qumran: Collected Essays (Mohr Siebeck 2008), chapter 23Extract of chapter 23, p. 20 No other extant manuscript uses in the biblical text.

Fortune named the species after Beale in an issue of the Gardeners' Chronicle and was sure it was a distinct species, separate from Mahonia japonica. However, Chronicle editor John Lindley, was unconvinced and repeatedly referred to the new species as Berberis (Mahonia) japonica. The confusion between M. japonica and M. bealei is reflected in subsequent literature, with the latter referred to variously as M. japonica var. bealei, M. japonica ‚ÄòBealei‚Äô or M. japonica Bealei Group. Plants labelled as M. bealei with silver undersides to the leaves have been recognized as the cultivar 'Silver Back', though the original Fortune plants lack this silver colouration; 'Silver Back' may represent a different species.  Uses  The berries are edible, but due to their high acidity they are almost as sour as lemons. The berries can be used as a good addition to jams to make them sweeter and darker.

This party was one of the last political movements linked to the figure of President Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo. History It was founded in 1960 by the merger of the Democratic Party, a small faction of the Radical Doctrinal Party, part of the People's National Party (PANAPO), the Democratic Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party. It initially participated in the FRAP until Ib√°√±ez' retirement in 1965. The party supported the presidential candidacy of Salvador Allende in 1964, but several parliamentarians withdrew to form the New Democratic Left, which supported Eduardo Frei. In 1970, the party supported the presidential candidacy of Radomiro Tomic of the Christian Democratic Party in opposition to Allende and Popular Unity. It joined the Confederation of Democracy in 1973. =Refoundation, division, and failed legalisation (1983-1999)= After the 1973 coup d'etat, PADENA entered in political recess and some of its members served in public offices during the military dictatorship. It was refounded in 1983, but two factions were created: one led by Luis Minchel, who opposed the dictatorship, and another led by Apolonides Parra which supported the military regime. Parra's faction in 1984 was part of the Group of Eight and later the National Democratic Agreement. In 1985, it signed the National Agreement for the Transition to Full Democracy. On 31 January 1986 the faction led by Parra was part of the Frente Democr√°tico de Concordia (FREDECO) along with the Social Democracy Party, the Radical Democracy, the Social Christian Movement, the Radical Civic Union, the Social Democratic Labour Movement, the Javiera Carrera Movement and the Arturo Matte Civic Center. PADENA emblem, 1988-1998. In 1988, the faction led by Minchel supported the \\"No\\" option on the national plebiscite. However, the Parra faction disagreed with Parra and formed the Democratic Party of Chile (PADECH), which supported the \\"Yes\\" option and then dissolved and became part of National Renewal. On 2 February 1988, it signed the statement of formation of the Concertaci√≥n, but it did not get the number of signatures required for its legalisation and was disbanded by the Electoral Service on 12 September of that year. The PADENA emblem was a rectangular white flag with navy blue trim, and in the center of this a red anvil appeared. In the 1990s, four attempts were made to legalise PADENA again. These were all unsuccessful due to the refusal of the Electoral Service. The party failed to comply with the legal requirements within the stipulated time frame: * On 28 June 1991, it was declared a party in formation, and registration was expired on 28 January 1992. * On 17 February 1994, it was declared a party in formation, and registration was expired on 24 September 1994. * On 2 October 1997, it presented to the Servel its constitution writing, however this was returned to its authors on 8 October of the same year. * On 13 October 1998, it was declared a party in formation, and registration was expired on 18 May 1999.

The film premiered on November 15, 2008. Within Japan it was released via Joueikai and Oyako Eiga . Its tagline was \\"Don't Give Up on Your Dreams.\\" The film portrays the career of Yoichi Hatta, a civil engineer active in Japanese Taiwan, and his interactions with the native Taiwanese. It was financed as a commemoration of the 115th anniversary of the Hokkoku Shimbun, a newspaper in Hatta's hometown of Kanazawa, and produced by Mushi Productions. Preview screenings were held on November 11, 2008 at Hokkoku Shimbun's Akabane Hall and on November 20 at Meiji Yasuda Life Hall (MY Shinjuku Building), while the first public screening was held on November 15 at the opening of Kanazawa's Corona Cinema World. Afterwards, it was primarily screened in schools and public institutions in Ishikawa Prefecture and from May 8, 2009 in Cinemate Mini- Theater in Shinjuku. It was also released in Taiwan. The film's title is derived from Patten lai-a, the Taiwanese term for \\"Hatta has come,\\" ().  Plot  In the early stages of Japanese colonization in Taiwan, the Chianan Plain in southwestern Taiwan was considered a barren land due to its low rainfall and lack of irrigation. Yoichi Hatta is sent to this area by the colonial government to develop plans for massive irrigation projects. At first the local farmers question Hatta's intentions and harbor feelings of hostility. But among them, a boy named Yingzhe is moved by Hatta's conviction in his project and comes to understand the necessity of a dam and wishes to become a civil engineer as well. Susumu, a boy who lives in a nearby community of Japanese laborers, has a dream of riding in an airplane. Yingzhe and Susumu are kindred spirits and discuss their dreams. But one day, over 50 people die due to a construction explosion, among them Susumu's father. There is talk of halting construction, and Hatta is distressed.

He was a commissioner for exchequer bills and senior partner of the banking firm John Perring, Shaw, Barber & Co., which having sufferered in the Panic of 1825, resulted in Perring losing his estates. On 3 October 1808 he was created a baronet, first of the Perring baronets of Membland, Devon. Origins Perring was described as \\"the son of a poor man\\".Collinge He was born in about 1765, the eldest son of Philip Perring (died 1797), of Denbury House, Church Street, Modbury in Devon, a serge maker,Scarratt, Anne, The Woollen Industry of Modbury, The Modbury Group, 2005-13 by his wife and cousin Susanna Legassick, daughter of Richard (or Pascoe) Legassick, apparently a wealthy cloth merchant at Modbury.http://www.modbury-heritage.co.uk/panels/woollen_industry.htm The estate of Membland in the parish of Holbeton had been purchased by John Perring's uncle Peter Perring from John Bulteel (1733‚Äì1801), who had no further use for it having inherited the adjacent estate of Flete from his young nephew Courtenay Croker Bulteel of Flete and Lyneham, Yealmpton.Prince, John, (1643‚Äì1723) The Worthies of Devon, 1810 edition, London, p.273 Sir John Perring occupied Membland Hall in 1799 and from 1816 to 1827. Civic career He was created an alderman in the City of London's Broad Street ward on 13 January 1798 as a clothworker. He was subsequently elected one of the Sheriffs of the City of London in 1800. On 9 November 1803, Perring was proclaimed Lord Mayor of London. John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon, in his capacity as Lord Chancellor informed King George III of Perring's appointment, privately describing Perring as \\"in private life a person of worth, and, in public, of sound and loyal principles\\". John Silvester, the Recorder of London referenced the spectre of Napoleon Bonaparte and the burgeoning Napoleonic Wars in his announcement of Perring's appointment, stating that \\"At a time so awful as the present, when the country is threatened by an implacable and unprincipled enemy, it is of the last importance that the civic chair should be filled by a person in whom the greatest confidence can be placed\\". Silvester ominously warned Perring that \\"The keys of the Metropolis are placed in your hands, at the moment when the enemy are at the gates\\". The ball held later that day at Guildhall was opened with a minuet danced by Perring's eldest daughter and the Spanish Ambassador. The Napoleonic wars and the threat of a French invasion had led to coastal batteries being built as fortifications along the south coast of England in the summer of 1803. Perring was furious to find that a battery had been built on land that he owned at the mouth of the River Yealm in Devon, and wrote to the Secretary of War, Lord Hobart. Perring was eventually pacified by many letters from John Graves Simcoe, who was in charge of the construction of the defences. With the threat of invasion by the French still present, Perring presented the colours of the Corporation of London to the ten regiments of the London Loyal Infantry who assembled at Blackheath on 18 May 1804. Perring was accompanied on the grand procession to Blackheath by the Earl of Harrington, Earl Amherst and Prince Frederick, Duke of York. Post-Mayoralty Pering was elected the Member of Parliament for New Romney at the 1806 general election, but lost his seat the following year at the 1807 general election. He was re-elected to parliament in three successive elections for the Hythe constituency from 1810. In 1808, Perring hosted a meeting of the 'friends of Lady Hamilton', a group of financiers organised by Abraham Goldsmid to raise money for Emma, Lady Hamilton, the mistress of Lord Nelson, following Nelson's death. Perring attended the coronation of George IV in July 1821. The satirist John Wolcot under his pseudonym of \\"Peter Pindar\\", wrote an 'Instructive epistle' to Perring, satirically proposing an 'Address of Thanks' to Prime Minister Henry Addington for his 'Great and Upright Conduct when Prime Minister'. A banker by trade, Perring headed the firm of John Perring, Shaw, Barber & Co. Perring's bank issued bonds for the South American land speculator Gregor MacGregor. The suspension of payments by Perring's bank in the subsequent Panic of 1825, and its failure to satisfy creditors in the panic led Perring to lose his estates. Marriage and children In 1790 he married Elizabeth Cowell (died 1811), daughter of John Cowell of Stratford, Essex, by whom he had two sons and three daughters as follows: *Sir John Perring, 2nd Baronet (1794‚Äì1843), eldest son and heir; *Phillip Perring; *Elizabeth Perring; *Jane Perring; *Laura Perring. Death He died at Burton Crescent in 1831, aged 65.

By joining efforts of a few companies and incorporating various changes and new features into MySQL, WebScaleSQL aimed toward fulfilling various needs arising from the deployment of MySQL in large-scale environments, which involve large amounts of data and numerous database servers. The source code of WebScaleSQL is hosted on GitHub and licensed under the terms of version 2 of the GNU General Public License. The project website announced in December 2016 that the companies involved would no longer contribute to the project.  Overview  Running MySQL on numerous servers with large amounts of data, at the scale of terabytes and petabytes of data, creates a set of difficulties that in many cases arise the need for implementing specific customized MySQL features, or the need for introducing functional changes to MySQL. More than a few companies have faced the same (or very similar) set of difficulties in their production environments, which used to result in the availability of multiple solutions for similar challenges. WebScaleSQL was announced on March 27, 2014 as a joint effort of Facebook, Google, LinkedIn and Twitter (with Alibaba Group joining in January 2015), aiming to provide a centralized development structure for extending MySQL with new features specific to its large-scale deployments, such as building large replicated databases running on server farms. As a result, WebScaleSQL attempted to open a path toward deduplicating the efforts each founding company had been putting into maintaining its own branch of MySQL, and toward bringing together more developers. WebScaleSQL was created as a branch of the MySQL's latest production-ready community release, which was version 5.6 . As the project aimed to tightly follow new MySQL community releases, a branching path was selected instead of becoming a software fork of MySQL. The selection of MySQL production-ready community releases for the WebScaleSQL's upstream, instead of selecting some of the available MySQL forks was the result of a consensus between the four founding companies, which concluded that the features already existing in MySQL 5.6 are suitable for large-scale deployments, while additional features of the same kind are planned for MySQL 5.7.  Features  The initial changes and feature additions that WebScaleSQL introduced to the MySQL 5.6 codebase came from the engineers employed by the four founding companies; however, the project was open to peer-reviewed community contributions. , available new features and changes included the following: * A software framework that provides automated testing of all proposed changes * A customized suite of database performance tests * Various changes to the automated tests provided by the MySQL community releases * Performance improvements in various areas, including buffer pool flushing, execution of certain types of SQL queries, and support for NUMA architectures * Changes related to large-scale deployments, such as the ability to specify sub-second client timeouts * Performance and reliability improvements to the global transaction identifier (GTID) feature of MySQL 5.6 * So-called \`super_read_only\` operation mode for the MySQL server, which disables data modification operations even for privileged database accounts , planned new features and changes included the following: * New asynchronous MySQL client that will eliminate the client-side waiting while establishing database connections, sending queries, and receiving their results * Availability of various table, user and compression statistics * Changes to the internal compression mechanisms * Addition of a logical read-ahead mechanism that will bring significant performance improvements for full table scans  Availability  WebScaleSQL is distributed in a source-code-only form, with no official binaries available. , compiling the source code and running WebScaleSQL is supported only on x86-64 Linux hosts, requiring at the same time a toolchain that supports C99 and C++11 language standards. The source code is hosted on GitHub and available under version 2 of the GNU General Public License (GPL v2).

The Chalice of Do√±a Urraca is a jewel-encrusted onyx chalice kept at the Basilica of San Isidoro in Le√≥n, Spain, which belonged to infanta Urraca of Zamora (1033-1101), daughter of Ferdinand I of Leon. In March 2014, Spanish authors Margarita Torres and Jos√© Ortega del Rio asserted the chalice could be the purported Holy Grail (a claim that had never been done during the roughly one thousand years the chalice had been kept in the Basilica). Although the claim was met with disbelief by historians and specialists, who claim the materials and techniques used in the chalice indicate a mid-11th century origin, the allegations led to unprecedented crowds swarming to the Basilica to see it, which led to the setting aside of a separate exhibition room only for the chalice. Location The chalice is kept at the Basilica of San Isidoro in Le√≥n, Spain, where historians say it has been since the 11th century.Historians claim Holy Grail is in church in Leon, northern Spain by Bob Fredericks (News.com.au, 1 April 2014) The publication of The Kings of the Grail in March 2014, which claims the chalice is the Holy Grail, led museum staff at the basilica to once withdraw the chalice from display, saying the crowds seeking to visit the museum were too large for it to handle. The museum now displays the chalice in a separate room in the tower alongside the old library.Crowds swamp church in Spain after Holy Grail claim (Agence France-Presse, 1 April 2014) History and Holy Grail claims Authors and researchers Margarita Torres and Jos√© Ortega del Rio published their book, The Kings of the Grail, in March 2014 claiming they had traced the origins of the chalice to the early Christian communities of Jerusalem. The researchers say the chalice was transported to Cairo by Muslim travelers and was later given to an emir on the Spanish coast who had assisted victims of a famine in Egypt. From there, the chalice came into the possession of King Ferdinand I of Leon, father of Urraca of Zamora, as a peace offering by an Andalusian ruler.Historians identify 'Holy Grail' as goblet in Spanish museum, new book says by Joel Landau (New York Daily News, 31 March 2014) Dating suggests the chalice was made between 200 BC and 100 AD. According to Torres, \\"the only chalice that could be considered the chalice of Christ is that which made the journey to Cairo and then from Cairo to Le√≥n ‚Äî and that is this chalice\\". Archaeologists quickly sought to dispel Torres and del Rio's claims, pointing out that an estimated 200 different cups and chalices across Europe \\"vie for the title\\". Diarmaid MacCulloch, Professor of the History of the Church at Oxford University, said the claims were \\"idiotic\\".No rabbits guarding this \\"Holy Grail\\" by Tom Whipple (The Australian, 1 April 2014) The authors expressed uncertainty about whether Jesus actually used the cup.Spanish historians claim to have found Holy Grail by Guy Hedgecoe (Irish Times, 28 March 2014) References External links *Museo San Isidoro de Leon Category:Holy Grail Category:Le√≥n, Spain ","title":"Chalice of Do√±a Urraca"},{"id":"42364969","text":"Energhetic DubƒÉsari was a football club from DubƒÉsari, Republic of Moldova.

Background Howard Brillinger Selsam was born on 28 June 1903 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. His parents were John T. Selsam, a grocer, and his mother was Flora Emig Selsam. Selsam's education began in public schools in the Harrisburg area. Later, Selsam received his undergraduate degree in 1924 from Franklin & Marshall College, Lancaster, Pennsylvania. From 1924 through 1927, he taught at the American University of Beirut. Later, Selsam did graduate work in philosophy at Columbia University. At Columbia, he received both his MA (1928) and PhD (1931).Selsam's master's thesis dealt with Baron d'Holbach, and his dissertation concerned the English Hegelian philosopher Thomas Hill Green. Career In 1931, after receiving his PhD, Selsam served as an instructor and later as an assistant professor at Brooklyn College, where he worked for 10 years. Active politically, Selsam participated in anti-war events on campus and took \\"an active part in the social struggles of his day on the side of the communist movement.\\" Selsam's involvement is echoed in a contemporary newspaper article where Selsam is associated with Communist Party USA activities, yet he was careful not to impose his political beliefs on students. Nevertheless, Selsam published articles in left-wing periodicals such as The New Masses, although Selsam used the pseudonym \\"Paul Salter.\\" The political activities of Selsam and other Brooklyn College faculty members attracted the attention of governmental investigation. Despite their denials of Communist association to reporters, Selsam and other faculty members later lost their teaching positions due to the Rapp-Coudert Committee investigations into Communist involvement in public education in New York State. That Selsam refused to testify at the hearings and faced contempt charges likely made his resignation unavoidable. =Communist schools= Circa 1941, Howard Selsam was one of the founders of the School for Democracy, an educational facility located at 13 Astor Place in New York and associated with the Communist Party USA. In 1944, Selsam became the director of the Jefferson School of Social Science,Marv Gettleman, \\"Jefferson School of Social Science,\\" in Mari Jo Buhle, Paul Buhle, and Dan Georgakas (eds.), Encyclopedia of the American Left. First Edition. New York: Garland Publishing Co., 1990; pp. 389-390. a \\"Marxist adult education facility\\" whose faculty included \\"leftist academics dismissed from the City University of New York.\\" He held this position from 1944-1956. Under Selsam's leadership (1944-1956), there was a steady flow of students at the Jefferson School. Even during the hey-day of Senator Joseph McCarthy's well publicized investigations into Communist subversion, the Jefferson School had an enrollment of 5,000 students each term. Nevertheless, the school received criticism claiming that students simply received dogmatic instruction. For example, a Rutgers University economics professor, Alexander Balinky enrolled in the school and took some classes. Based on his experiences at the school, Balinky wrote a newspaper article and claimed that the students received political indoctrination at the school. In early December 1947 when news that the Jefferson School of Social Science had appeared on the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations (AGLOSO), Selsam told the New York Times: > There is nothing subversive about the Jefferson School. Its organization and > teaching are open and above board. Its aims and purposes are clearly defined > in its bulletin of courses and other material it issues. If the school is > subversive, then any teaching of social science that differs from the > beliefs of J. Edgar Hoover (chief of the Federal Bureau of Investigation) is > to be labeled subversive. Due to tensions caused by the Cold War, Anti-communism, and McCarthyism, the Jefferson School was subject to Congressional hearings and Selsam and others received summons to testify on several occasions. For example, Selsam, represented by Joseph Forer, testified before the U.S. Senate's Internal Security Subcommittee on 8 April 1953, and, during Selsam's testimony, he often invoked the Fifth Amendment. Selsam and other school administrators denied that the school was a Communist front and fought against having it so officially labeled. Given the political radicalism of the faculty members and the Marxist-oriented instruction at the school, and facing external political pressure against the school, declining student enrollment, and publication in the West of Nikita Khrushchev's secret speech‚Äîa speech which described in detail Stalin's crimes and political purges ‚Äîall of these factors ultimately forced the school administrators to close down the school in 1956. =SISS testimony= On April 8, 1953, represented by attorney Joseph Forer, Selsam accused the committee as much as it accused him. He blamed congressional committees for creating an \\"atmosphere of repression and terror.\\" \\"Every witness... knows full well the meaning of your subpoena server's knock... dismissal from his job.\\" =Khrushchev speech= Khrushchev's secret speech and its aftermath caused considerable turmoil within the Communist Party USA, and Selsam and other Jefferson School faculty members openly quit the Party in a joint letter published in the May 6, 1956 issue of the Daily Worker. =Later Life= With the closure of the Jefferson School of Social Science, Selsam devoted much of his time lecturing and writing. He wrote a number of books on Marxist topics for International Publishers. Many of these books were republished in Canada, England, and India. In addition, Selsam's books were translated into a variety of languages, including Spanish, Arabic, Polish, Russian, German, Hungarian, and Japanese. Besides writing books, Selsam wrote articles and reviews for periodicals, including The New Masses, and Marxism Today. He worked closely and collaborated with his wife Millicent Selsam, a botanist and high school teacher who was well known as an author of science books for young people. Besides writing for The New Masses and Marxism Today, Selsam was an editorial board member for the Marxist journal Science & Society, and he was a founder of the American Institute for Marxist Studies. Selsam had correspondence with prominent intellectuals and writers, including historian and civil rights activist W.E.B. Du Bois Personal life and death Selsam married Millicent Selsam, a botanist and high school teacher During his last years Selsam had a heart ailment., and he died in New York on September 7, 1970. He was survived by his wife, Millicent Selsam, a son, Robert, and his sister Mrs. Esther Garman. Partial bibliography of published works *Selsam, Howard. 1930. T.H. Green: critic of empiricism.

Background In his previous fight, George Foreman had dominated Joe Frazier, knocking the champion down six times in less than two rounds to become the new undisputed heavyweight champion on January 22, 1973. For his first defense, it was announced that Foreman would travel to Tokyo to take on little-known Puerto Rican challenger Jose \\"King\\" Roman. Prior to landing his title match against Foreman, Roman had little success at that point, fighting mostly unknown jorneyman, losing seven times and was not viewed as legit threat to take Foreman's titles. Roman would nevertheless make history as the fourth Hispanic and first Puerto Rican fighter to challenge for a major heavyweight title. The fight was also the first heavyweight title bout to take place in Japan and would remain the only one until Mike Tyson successfully defended his undisputed heavyweight title in the Tokyo Dome against Tony Tubbs in 1988. The Fight Foreman would make quick work of Roman, ending the fight after just two minutes and making it one of the shortest heavyweight title fights in history. A little over a minute into the fight, Foreman had Roman up against the ropes and landed several powerful punches that put Roman down. Roman was able to get back up and continue on, but Foreman quickly resumed his attack and caught Roman flush with a right hook that sent Roman crashing to the mat. Roman again answered the referee's count, but Foreman would quickly hit Roman with a right uppercut that put Roman down for the count.

Initial development of the theory was undertaken by William H. DeLone and Ephraim R. McLean in 1992, and was further refined by the original authors a decade later in response to feedback received from other scholars working in the area.DeLone, W. H. and McLean, E. R. (2002). Information Systems Success Revisited. Proceedings of the 35th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), Big Island, Hawaii, 238-249. The IS success model has been cited in thousands of scientific papers, and is considered to be one of the most influential theories in contemporary information systems research. Dimensions of IS success The IS success model identifies and describes the relationships among six critical dimensions of IS success: information quality, system quality, service quality, system use/usage intentions, user satisfaction, and net system benefits. =Information quality= Information quality refers to the quality of the information that the system is able to store, deliver, or produce, and is one of the most common dimensions along which information systems are evaluated. Information quality impacts both a user‚Äôs satisfaction with the system and the user‚Äôs intentions to use the system, which, in turn, impact the extent to which the system is able to yield benefits for the user and organization. =System quality= As with information quality, the overall quality of a system is also one of the most common dimensions along which information systems are evaluated. System quality indirectly impacts the extent to which the system is able to deliver benefits by means of mediational relationships through the usage intentions and user satisfaction constructs. =Service quality= Along with information quality and system quality, information systems are also commonly evaluated according to the quality of service that they are able to deliver. Service quality directly impacts usage intentions and user satisfaction with the system, which, in turn, impact the net benefits produced by the system. =System use/usage intentions = Intentions to use an information system and actual system use are well- established constructs in the information systems literature. In the IS success model system use and usage intentions are influenced by information, system, and service quality.

Following this decision, Popoviƒá was elected as President of LP. He was a member of the Council of the European Movement for Independent Montenegro at the state and municipal level. At the 2012 parliamentary elections LP entered the coalition with governing parties DPS and SDP, thus gaining one seat in the Parliament, which was occupied by Popoviƒá. Due to internal disagreements, Liberal Party froze its membership in the Coalition for European Montenegro, and is acting in the Parliament in the group with the minority parties (Croatian and Albanian minority representatives). However, this change has been only formal, because the minority group is also an integral part of the ruling majority. During the Fourth Regular Conference of the Liberal Party of Montenegro that was held on 14 September 2013, Popoviƒá has been re-elected as President of LP.

It was released in 2014 for PC and iOS and is the first major project of Pixel since Cave Story in 2004. The game places a heavy emphasis on shooting and received positive reviews on both platforms. A short, free demo titled Pink Hour was made available a month before the full game's release. A short free companion game and sequel to Pink Hour titled Pink Heaven was released in November 2015, coinciding with the new Kero Blaster update. Gameplay In Kero Blaster, the player controls a frog working for Cat & Frog, a teleporter company. Armed with a peashooter, he has to clean the teleporters of strange black monsters. The player has to work their way through a series of linear stages, by means of running, gunning and jumping. USGamer described the gameplay as \\"akin to ... Contra or old-school, pre-Symphony of the Night Castlevanias.\\" Kero Blaster is controlled by changing direction, jumping, and charging and firing the player character's weapon. Holding down the fire button continues to fire in the direction the character was facing when he started shooting, allowing players to move the character and change the firing direction independently. Development and release Kero Blaster was originally supposed to be released in 2013, but Pixel delayed its release at the last second. The game was rebuilt from Gero Blaster, which Pixel announced on in Japan, early 2013, but never released. Gero Blaster was a game based on comics that Pixel drew in college, starring himself as a frog and his girlfriend as a cat. While Pixel developed Cave Story entirely on his own, he worked together with Kiyoko Kawanaka for Kero Blaster so that he could stay motivated. When Pixel left the level design and production up to her, Pixel \\"was able to focus on smaller parts while the stages in the game were steadily being created.\\" A month before the full release, Pixel released a demo and prologue to Kero Blaster, titled Pink Hour. In this demo, you play as an unnamed pink office lady who must find a missing document to avoid the anger of her boss. The short game is rather hard, due to the limited amount of lives the player has to beat it with. The release date of Kero Blaster, May 11, 2014, coincides with the three-year anniversary of Japanese digital distributor Playism, on which the game was released. Kero Blaster was released on Steam on . In November 2015, Kero Blaster was updated as Pixel added a \\"Hard Mode\\" and \\"Overtime Mode\\" to the game. Alongside this update, Pixel released a second short, free game titled Pink Heaven, which is the sequel to Pink Hour. This companion game once again starred the pink office lady and served as a demo for Kero Blaster. A PlayStation 4 port of the game was released on April 11, 2017.

Reception Before the full release, PCGamer called the free Pink Hour demo \\"too brief and too difficult to really get to grips with,\\" though praised the game's trailer. After the release of Kero Blaster, Touch Arcade described Pink Hour as a \\"great way to check out what KeroBlaster is about - or just to get a new level of the game to play.\\" Destructoid described the demo as \\"hard as nails,\\" yet also as \\"very lovable.\\" Kero Blaster received positive reviews upon release.Kero Blaster for PC at GameRankings Destructoid praised the game's pacing and replay value, stating that it's the perfect way to introduce someone to the genre of 2D action/platformers. USGamer praised the game's controls, weapons and presentation, calling it an \\"excellent run-and-gun shooter that plays beautifully,\\" but criticized the short length of the game. PCGamer states that the game sounds \\"like it could've come from an NES if a composer had spent the past 25 years mastering its sound chip,\\" and though they criticized the high difficulty of the game, PCGamer said that it was \\"refreshing to play a game with such mechanical purity.\\" Eurogamer stated that Kero Blaster is not less engaging than Cave Story, despite its short length, and describes it as \\"a three-hour trip that demands to be finished.\\" The game is often compared to Cave Story, the highly successful previous game created by Pixel. According to Touch Arcade, Kero Blaster has the \\"same sort of off- beat sense of humor, chip music of similar quality and composition, pixel art graphics, and a vaguely similar style of play based heavily on platforming and shooting.\\" However, where Cave Story is known for its non-linear exploration, Kero Blaster features \\"stage-based run and gun action.\\" Cave Story is cited to be similar to Metroid, while Kero Blaster is more often compared to Contra and Mega Man.

The program was designed and carried out by the US partnered with Great Britain and France. The program began in 1944 with Nazi defeat looming and evidence that Germany was covertly transferring sources of capital to neutral countries to escape war reparations and potentially aid a resurgence of the regime in the post-war period. The central goal of Operation Safehaven was to ensure Germany would not be able to start another war, with the specific aims of the program articulated in the Spring of 1944. The short-term aims focused on identifying and locating German assets and blocking the transfer of German assets to neutral countries, and the long-term aims involved persuading neutral countries to turn over German assets as war reparations to ensure the restoration of Europe. The overall objective of the operation was to dissipate Nazi wealth in order to render any possible post-war resurgence controllable and to make it impossible for Germany to start another war.Korcaighe P. Hale (2009), \\"The Limits of Diplomatic Pressure: Operation Safehaven and the Search for German Assets in Ireland\\", Irish Historical Studies 36(143): 389‚Äì406. Operation Safehaven begun with communications in May 1944 between the Foreign Economic Administration (FEA) to the Department of State and the Department of Treasury where an interagency program was put forward. . Interagency conflict was present between the Foreign Economic Administration, Department of State and Department of Treasury throughout the course of the Safehaven program with respect to which agency controlled the program. The Bretton Woods Conference, which took place in New Hampshire in July 1944, assisted in building a legal base for the Safehaven program. The Bretton Woods Resolution VI was officially accepted in July 22. Resolution VI outlined aims stating that neutral nations were to take immediate action to prevent the transfer and concealment of assets from Axis locations to neutral countries Negotiations took place between the Allied forces and the neutral nations concerning the Safehaven programs objectives. Germany depended on trade with neutral nations throughout the Second World War, importing numerous goods and raw materials from Sweden, Turkey, Switzerland, Spain and Portugal Bargaining over trade with Allied nations with the neutral nations was one of the economic warfare instruments used by the Allied nations to prevent the transfer of German assets to neutral countries.  Background  Liberation of Paris in 1944 Allied Victory in 1945 was the result of the co-existence of a variety of factors. The success of the attack at Normandy on D-Day was of great significance for allied victory and forced the German Wehrmacht to defend the western front , diverting German resources from the eastern front, subsequently weakening the strength of the army. The initial assault on Normandy by the allies on the 6th of June 1944, also known as ‚ÄòD Day‚Äô, employed 50,000 troops and 12,000 aircraft to successfully capture beaches and consolidate positions in the Normandy pocket through aerial bombardment and barrage. By mid-July 1944, the allies were firmly established in Normandy and ready to break out, allowing them to liberate Paris in just 6 weeks on the 25th of July. D-Day and the liberation of France as a strategy were instrumental to the success of Operation Bagration, the Russian counter-offensive, which forced Hitler to open up new fronts. By the end of February 1944 Army Group North had been defeated and the German siege of Leningrad was lifted, a sign of the commencement of the Russian counter offensive. Operation Bagration, pioneered by General Zhukov was launched in June of 1944 and employed 1 million men and 2 thousand aircraft to encircle and destroy the German Army Group Centre, which pushed the Germans into retreat and liberated eastern Europe. Allied bombing of Germany, which intensified in 1944, was also a successful program in the air war which forced Germany to divert soldiers and resources to the home front and focus artillery production away from offensive operations. This drained Germany‚Äôs resources and weakened Germany‚Äôs capacity to wage war whilst simultaneously placing the allies in a position of power.  Origins of the Safehaven Program  By 1944, the Allied forces had a high likelihood of defeating the German Nazis, forcing them to start preparing precautionary measures, like Operation Safehaven, against a resurgence of Nazi power. As allied victory had been secured, the United States wanted to ensure the Nazi‚Äôs would never be able to regain power again. There were great fears within the US State department and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of a fourth Reich being established by the Nazis in the future. Operation Safehaven was established in response to these fears with its overall objective to conduct intelligence on the location of Nazi assets and wealth in an attempt to cease it and steer it towards allied powers. Pictured: Henry Morgenthau Jr, the United States Secretary of the Treasury in 1947 The project was first proposed by the Director of the Foreign Economic Administration (FEA), Leo T. Crowley on May 5th 1944 in a letter to the United States Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr. Then on the 15th of May in a letter to Livingston T. Merchant , the FEA suggested an interagency program, collaborating with the British and other US agencies with a vested interest in the aims of the program to locate and intercept the transfer of German assets into neutral nations. In the letters, Leo T.Crowley, director of the Foreign Economic Administration, proposed an active investigation take place to identify the extent to which German assets were being moved to neutral nations. Samuel Klaus, special assistant to the Treasury Departments Special Counsel, led an information-gathering trip to Europe to examine the situation in neutral nations Klaus and his associates travelled to Lisbon, Stockholm, London and other countries in Europe advocating for the adoption of the programs aims. The objective of the trip was to supply information to Washington regarding German efforts to transfer assets to neutral nations, which Klaus established in his final report in 1944. Inner bureaucracies between the Foreign Economic Administration, Department of State and Department of Treasury predominated the trip, at times the Treasury Department was deliberately excluded from participation. = The FEA, Department of State and Department of Treasury = Discourse existed between the FEA, Department of State and Department of Treasury regarding who controlled the Safehaven program. The Special Areas Branch of the Foreign Economic Administration retained important information about the wartime economic activities of Germany and the neutral nations and proposed the initial idea of the Safehaven program. In 1944, a number of Foreign Economic Administration departments commenced formulating the program. Conflict arose between the Foreign Economic Administration and the Treasury and State Department as each agency claimed responsibility and authority over the program.  Bretton Woods Resolution VI  The United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference held at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire on 1-22 July, 1944. The United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, was held in July 1944 and involved forty-four countries. The conference was organised for the purpose of nations deciding upon a series of rules for the international monetary system post World War II. Three commissions made up the Bretton Woods Conference, with two commissions concerned with the final plans for the international monetary fund and with the primary interest of the Treasury and State Departments, the proposed World Bank, and the Stabilisation Fund. Commission III was concerned with residual matters, establishing various ad hoc committees, including a committee focused on enemy assets, looted goods and associated matters. The French and Polish delegates submitted proposals to this third commission, with the Polish proposal calling on neutral countries to block and liquidate Axis assets and the French proposing steps be taken to prevent Germany from successfully secreting funds under false names in neutral nations. The United States presented an alternative draft proposal which incorporated features of both the French and Polish proposals, leading the Polish and French to withdraw their proposals. The British assistant undersecretary of state for foreign affairs, Sir Nigel Bruce Ronald, initially opposed the US proposal on the grounds that the subject of the proposal was outside the scope of the conference. A lack of opposition from other countries led Britain to relent in its objection. The final text was presented to the Plenary Session of the Conference and was officially adopted on July 22 as the Bretton Woods Resolution VI. The first aim of the resolution stated that neutral nations were to take immediate action to prevent the transfer of assets from Axis locations to neutral countries. The second aim stated that neutral countries were to prevent the concealment of German assets. Resolution VI provided Operation Safehaven with the legal base necessary to pursue its aims. In September 1944 the US sent directives to neutral countries as well as those nations that had partaken in the Bretton Woods Conference to stress the urgency in establishing procedures that would achieve the goals of Resolution VI. Urgent action was taken by the US and Britain following the approval of Resolution VI. The British Ministry of Economic Warfare formed a Safehaven division that worked with American officials to merge the intelligence collected. The US and UK went on to direct their embassies in neutral countries to implement strategies that aligned with the goals of Resolution VI.  Methodology  Operation Safehaven was first conducted by gathering economic intelligence. In 1944 the US State Department invited the British Operations Support System (OSS) to collaborate and consolidate resources. = The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and Operation Safehaven = Office of Strategic Services Insignia The OSS Office of Strategic Services (OSS) had been collecting economic intelligence since 1942 in efforts to acquire direct information on potential methods of German evasion of post war control. The responsibility of the Office of Strategic Services was primarily to assemble and analyse information gathered from the informants under its control. The Secret Intelligence (SI) Branch of the Office of Strategic Services was tasked with project Safehaven as information collection fell within the division's scope. The Office of Strategic Services counter-intelligence branch, X-2, acquired a central role alongside SI, due to the nature of the program as both an effort to stop post-war German economic penetration in neutral countries as well as a data collection operation. The addition of the Safehaven program resulted in a redirection of classified information for the Office of Strategic Services, who had been gathering information on German economic activities to comprehend the war economy from 1942. Key Office of Strategic Services foreign stations located in Portugal, Switzerland and Spain, worked to uncover German efforts to obtain assets in neutral countries. In April 1945, X-2 was operating in Switzerland and delivered a comprehensive analysis to the Office of Strategic Services in Washington detailing currency and gold transfers by Nazi‚Äôs during the war that were arranged via Switzerland. In this summary, methods of transfers were described, including smuggling, undercover exchanges, sale of valuables and various others. X-2 reported in 1945 that warehouses in Sweden held German goods that had been transformed from 100 million Swedish kronor in gold and currency. The extensive information gathered by the Office of Strategic Services regarding the Safehaven program justified a formalised treatment of the program in the ranks of the Office of Strategic Services in 1945. This is evidenced in Edward Buxton, the Acting Director of Strategic Services, announcement signalling the Office of Strategic Services make a significant contribution to the program. Station Chiefs in different regions were required to document their current situation concerning the Safehaven program. An Economic Intelligence Collection Unit was established in Washington to synthesise Safehaven reports and improve the direction of Office of Strategic Services contribution. Operation Safehaven leaders also researched into the escape of Nazi leaders themselves and investigated how the movement of assets correlated with the movements of Nazis in South America. Research into ratlines and the involvement of airline KLM were conducted to assist in the tracking of Nazi‚Äôs and their assets.  Negotiations with neutral nations  Neutrals sustained independence during the Second World War by extending economic concessions to those engaged in war. Neutrals military strength compared to that of the belligerents was lesser and by providing concessions the likelihood of maintaining independence during WWII increased. Throughout the Second World War Germany relied upon neutral nations to provide sources of raw materials and resources. Germany was supplied with wolfram ore from Spain and Portugal, arms and ammunition from Switzerland, cobalt ore from Turkey and ball-bearings and iron-ore from Sweden. Negotiations over trade and economic relations took place between the neutral nations and the Allied forces. The London Declaration of January 1943 and The Gold declaration of February 1944 was a combined US-British approach to prevent neutral nations from trading with Germany. The declarations provided a formal warning about trading in plunder and loot to the neutral nations. The Treasury aimed to conduct a ‚Äúhard‚Äù approach towards negotiations concerning Safehaven program requirements of neutral countries, whilst the State and British counterparts encouraged a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù approach be taken to limit endangering the war trade agreements. = Switzerland = Switzerland provided Germany with considerable extended credits for their purchases during the initial stages of the war when Germany had expended majority of its economic resources. Germany utilised Switzerland for the transit of goods through the Alp-tunnels, for purchase of ammunition and machinery, for laundering of looted gold and purchase of other goods and services. German assets in Switzerland were approximated by US officials to equal as much as 1 billion in 1945. The types of assets Germany transferred to Switzerland included; gold, other precious metals, bearer stocks and bonds, US dollars and swiss francs. Majority of the German assets in Switzerland were illicitly acquired and disguised to conceal their holder. Methods of obscurement including; under- invoicing exports and over-invoicing imports, holding assets externally, rather than in financial institutions, assigning assets into third party accounts, misrepresenting original assets and falsifying residential status. Obscurement methods aimed to render the assets untraceable, ensure assets were readily movable and obtained their perceived worth. Switzerland reduced its exports of machinery, ammunition and other goods to Germany in August 1944 as a result of negotiations with the US and UK. Further negotiations led to a total ban on war material exports to Germany and Italy in Autumn. = Sweden = Swedish dealings with Germany were primarily in ball-bearings and iron-ore exports. In 1944 the US and Britain called for measures to identify and prevent the transfer of German external assets be taken by Sweden, in line with the aims of the Safehaven program. The US sought Swedish support by proposing the possibility of a renewed trade agreement. The Swedish Government stated actions would be taken to assist post-war recovery in Europe in September 1944 in line with the Safehaven programs. = Spain = Spain were initially reluctant to cooperate in Operation Safehaven. The Spanish government refused to extradite German officials to Allied countries as it conflicted with its neutrality and sovereignty. As Spain posed the largest threat to a resurgence of Nazi power, this was particularly alarming and discouraging for the Allies. On May 3rd 1948 the Allies and Spain reached an agreement over the liquidation of German property assets in Spain which became known as the Allied- Spanish Safehaven accord . This accord specified that Spain agreed to turn over 101.6 kilograms of looted Nazi gold in exchange for the allies publicly acknowledging that Spain had not been aware of their acquisition of looted gold . On November 3rd 1948, in compliance with the Gold Declaration of February 22nd 1944, the American embassy in Madrid reported that the gold had been deposited in the Foreign Exchange Institute, demonstrating Spain‚Äôs commitment to the Safehaven accord. = Turkey = Pictured: Franz von Papen Safehaven negotiations with Turkey were distinct from all other neutral country negotiations with the Allies as Turkey had been neutral up until February 1945 when they joined the Allied forces for the remainder of the war. Despite an allegiance with the Allies, the US did not see this as a factor to exempt Turkey from Safehaven accords. The United States believed that Turkey was used as an epicentre for reconnaissance during the war and that the German ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen was hiding assets in Turkey to reduce his economic penalties at the Nuremberg Trials of 1945/1946. As a result, the United States sent notes to Turkey on November 4th 1944 warning that it should not acquire or store additional German gold. The Turkish government did not respond to this note until March 1945 and failed to implement any measures to control German assets in Turkey. The Safehaven accord with Turkey was only decided on December 30th 1947. It stipulated that Turkey must agree to the January 1943 Declaration, the Gold Declaration of 1944 and the Bretton Woods Resolution VI. It also declared that Turkey would deliver to the Allies all monetary gold proven to have been looted from German victims, however only once Turkish claims against Germany had been satisfied. The Allies were under the impression that the Turkish ratification of the Safehaven agreement was only awaiting the passing of a bill in their National Assembly granting them authority to negotiate and approve the agreement. However on March 25th 1950 when the Turkish National Assembly adjourned without passing the Safehaven agreement, the Allies, frustrated at a lack of progress, abandoned the Allied-Turkish Safehaven Accord and began exploring other negotiation avenues to achieve their diplomatic goals. = Ireland = In October of 1944 the United States sent notes to Ireland declaring an intention to confiscate German assets from the neutral countries after the war was won and asked for cooperation in these efforts. Ireland was requested to catalogue all German assets and property within its borders. Ireland‚Äôs geographical isolation from Europe largely restricted German capacities to hide assets in Ireland during the war. This resulted in Ireland possessing the smallest number of German assets out of the neutral nations. Safehaven initiatives in Ireland were as a result not driven by the Allies‚Äô need to secure assets but rather acted as a vehicle by which Ireland could be punished for its neutrality during the war. Consistent with the views of Spain, Ireland was initially reluctant to participate in the Safehaven program due to fears of compromising its neutrality and sovereignty. After a three-year diplomatic battle with the United States Ireland sent a note in August of 1948 to the Allies detailing German capital assets remaining in Ireland and offering cooperation with the Safehaven program.  Operation Safehaven after the war  After the second world war ended, the responsibility of restoring assets recovered during the war by the Allies in Germany and other neutral nations was carried out. This was a complex task as looted gold and other assets were difficult to trace. Limitations of the Operation Operation Safehaven was plagued with weaknesses from its conception. The directives given to the FEA, State and Treasury departments in 1944 regarding the aims, objectives, procedures, scope and depth of Operation Safehaven were exceptionally broad, vague and unclear. This resulted in large quantities of intelligence all being equated to have the same worth and usefulness and subsequently all pieces of intelligence were investigated into lightly and quickly, rather than deciphering the most useful intelligence and conducting an in-depth investigation into a lead. Logo of the FBI: one of the many agencies involved in Operation Safehaven The size and scope of Operation Safehaven was another contributing factor to its lack of success. By July 1944, more than 12 taskforces across 8 different agencies were involved in the operation. This included 5 FEA branches; the Office of Economic Programs, General Council Office, Special Areas Branch, Branch Blockade Division and Economic Intelligence Division. It also included the Department of State, the Department of War, The Department of Treasury, the Office of Censorship, the Office of Strategic Services, the FBI and the Office of Naval Intelligence. The operation as a result produced hundreds of files and intelligence inquires, an excessive amount of information that spanned across 6 continents. Effective communication and collaboration across this extensive network of agencies was virtually impossible and resulted in major inefficiencies. Major discourse that existed between the FEA, the State Department and the Department of Treasury also diminished Operation Safehaven‚Äôs capacity for success. The FEA and the Department of Treasury sought a punitive peace; an approach that intended to punish and weaken Germany as a consequence for their actions during the war while the State Department wanted to keep Germany powerful but pacified. These conflicting attitudes created a power struggle in the US government as each agency fought for control of the operation. These politics sabotaged the operation from within by restricting efficiency and directing the focus of the department officials away from Safehaven‚Äôs objectives.  Outcomes  By 1948 little progress had been made and the intelligence produced by Operation Safehaven proved to not be very useful or of importance to the Allies. In 1948, Cold war fears and uncertainty outweighed the fears of a fourth Reich resurgence and subsequently the need for Operation Safehaven diminished and eventually saw its termination due to the fact that the United States and Allied forces placed their priorities on foreign affairs other than Safehaven. While no new investigations in Operation Safehaven were undertaken post 1948, it took the Allies years to collect and implement the accords established under the operation. The Allied-Swiss Safehaven accord proved highly complex and took over 10 years to interpret and resolve the disputes and questions arising from the agreement. There were also extensive delays in the allies physically receiving all the assets. The last of the Safehaven agreements were not received until July 1959 when the Allies received the outstanding $65 million pesetas from Spain, representing the end of Spanish payments.

Moore. In a modern world where magic supplanted science, the unaired pilot featured two non-intersecting stories: the death of a city executive at the hands of a wrongful convict, and the introduction of terrorists who are devoted to the destruction of magic. Moore developed the series with Sony Pictures Television for NBCUniversal, bringing with him several of the stars of his reimagined Battlestar Galactica franchise as cast members. The series was pitched in September 2010, the pilot was ordered January 2011, NBC passed on the series in May 2011, and the unaired pilot was leaked in December 2011. Reviewers mostly liked 17th Precinct, commenting on its innovativeness despite its police procedural roots. Plot The series takes place in the American city of Excelsior (shot in Vancouver, modeled on San Francisco), in a world where science was never \\"invented\\", and instead of using \\"oil, electricity, [and] coal\\", mankind relies on plant- and fire-powered magic to run society. The police of Excelsior's 17th Precinct use spells to collect evidence and information, they defend themselves with \\"magic discs\\", and they psychically access \\"the stream\\" (a smokey light beam) for information, printouts, and newspapers. =Unaired pilot= Donald Pynchon, Excelsior's executive prophet (a city government official concerned with making and interpreting city-wide prophesies), is murdered in a North Beach back alley on September 23, 2011. Detectives Longstreet and Bosson (Bamber & Callis) are tasked with the case and determine that his murder was intentionally brutal, and it was unobserved due to a magical charm which deadened sound in the alley. It turns out that fifteen years previously, Pynchon was in Mendocino, California when, relying on a prophetic vision, testified against Lionel Dixon on charges of rape and murder. Dixon received a life sentence of magically reliving his victim's final experiences. After Dixon was acquitted thirteen years later, he was magically given a new life as a child (Quinn Lord) in an effort to make up for the mistaken identity; Dixon instead was driven to murder both Pynchon and the acquitting judge. Unconnected with the Pynchon case, DCI Wilder Blanks (Walker) begins seeing visions related to the Stoics, \\"a group dedicated to the destruction of magic\\" in favor of \\"reason, rationality, and [...] science\\" --a laughable prospect, but one about which they are deadly serious. Twelve years previously (1999), the Stoics committed a series of murders to further their cause, but have neither been seen nor heard of since. Blanks retrieves DS Mira Barkley (Channing) from her dissatisfying work in another precinct to help with the Stoics; Barkley was his partner during the previous Stoics case. Blanks partners Barkley with rookie detective Jimmy Travers (Long) due to the latter's potential as an intuitive savant. Investigating a nuisance case in an apartment building, Barkley and Travers unwittingly allow the Stoics access to murder an otherwise protected tenant, a college professor of \\"advanced magical engineering and biology with an emphasis on power plant design.\\" In the d√©nouement, it is revealed that the Stoics use \\"mechanical, rather than 'true' magic\\" which nothing in their world can defend against; the professor was killed using the Stoics' means, something called a bullet. Production Ronald D. Moore created 17th Precinct. 17th Precinct was created by Ronald D. Moore and produced by Sony Pictures Television. Moore's development of 17th Precinct was part of a two-year deal with Sony Pictures Television to \\"create and executive produce series projects for broadcast and cable through his production company Tall Ship Prods.\\" When Moore pitched the show to NBCUniversal in September 2010, it carried with it an approximate $2 million price tag for the pilot and penalties. In January 2011, NBC ordered a pilot for the series from Moore and Sony. Cast Moore brought several actors with whom he'd worked before into 17th Precinct, particularly from the reimagined Battlestar Galactica franchise. * Jamie Bamber as Caolan Longstreet: A detective with the Excelsior Police Department (EX.P.D.), Longstreet is described as determined to succeed and be promoted; his skills allow him great forensic insight into a crime scene. Longstreet is married to Susan and has two children. Bamber foregoes his native British accent for an American one. * James Callis as Jeff Bosson: Longstreet's partner on the EX.P.D., Bosson is the counterpart to Longstreet's straight man and family man persona. In pre- release information on the series, it was said that Bosson is keeping a \\"big secret\\" from his partner. Callis retains his native British accent for 17th Precinct. * Tricia Helfer as Doctor Morgana Kurlansky: As the precinct's \\"public necromancer\\", Kurlansky communes with dead victims at crime scenes to gain their testimony, and coordinates with the police on other forensic evidence derived from the corpse. She has a personal relationship with DCI Blanks, which is not elaborated upon either in the leaked episode or the pre- release information. * Eamonn Walker as Detective Chief Inspector Wilder Blanks: Blanks is chief inspector at the EX.P.D. 12 years prior to the series' time, he was partnered with DS Barkley during the Stoics' previous series of murders. As an \\"intuitive savant\\", Blanks experiences visions and feelings which have tangible connections to events. * Esai Morales as Detective Inspector Liam Butterfield: Working at the EX.P.D., Butterfield has an antagonistic relationship with DS Barkley from her previous stint working in the Homicide Division. The character also was apparently a woman (Lisa) when last associated with Barkley, a change about which he is defensive when she needles him--\\"I'm not Lisa anymore, inside or out.\\"; io9 described Butterfield as \\"[o]therwise, he's pretty much a total hard-ass.\\" * Stockard Channing as Detective Sergeant Mira Barkley: After dissatisfied years working in the Robbery Division, Barkley is brought back at the request of DCI Blanks because of her expertise from working the Stoics' murders in Alameda 12 years previously. She was partnered with Blanks when he was just a rookie. * Matt Long as Detective James \\"Jimmy\\" Travers: As a rookie officer, Travers is partnered with Barkley because of his potential as an \\"intuitive savant\\". * Kristin Kreuk as Susan: Longstreet's wife did not appear in the unaired pilot, but was said to run a declining antiques store and have a \\"huge dark secret.\\" Release On May 12, 2011, NBC announced that they had passed on 17th Precinct for their fall 2011 season of shows. NBC instead ordered a full season of another program featuring a supernatural angle on the traditional police procedural genre, Universal Television's Grimm. The unnamed pilot episode of 17th Precinct was leaked online at Vimeo in the last days of December 2011. Reception Science fiction blog io9 called Moore a \\"master of world-building\\", describing Excelsior as a richly described setting. They lauded its freshness in spite of its police procedural genre, saying that it was \\"bursting with new ideas\\" and \\"[r]ejuvenated a whole new genre\\". Airlock Alpha also commended 17th Precinct for incorporating a fresh take on the police procedural genre, though also felt the pilot introduced too many characters and concepts. TG Daily thought the concept was cool, though they felt \\"the execution could use a little polish\\". They also specifically lauded Bamber, Helfer, and Callis, while not being overly impressed by the supporting cast. In the end, they would have preferred 17th Precinct over Grimm.

For snow to push into the southern region of Louisiana, extreme weather conditions for the area must be present, usually a low- pressure system coupled with unusually low temperatures. Average snowfall in Louisiana is approximately per year, a low figure rivaled only by the states of Florida and Hawaii. Due to the infrequency of these cold weather patterns, southern areas affected in this state are often unprepared to deal with slick streets and freezing temperatures. According to the National Weather Service, measurable snowfall amounts occur on an average of only once every other year in Northwest Louisiana; many consecutive years may pass with no measurable snowfall. The heaviest snowstorm of record in the Shreveport area is 11.0 inches in December of 1929. This fell on the 21st and 22nd, and one-half inch remained on the ground December 25th, making this the only Christmas Day of record with snow on the ground. In 1948, 12.4 inches of snow was measured for the month of January for the greatest monthly amount on record. Occasional ice and sleet storms do considerable damage to trees, power and telephone lines, as well as make travel very difficult. Notable events Lake Charles, Louisiana in 1895 1895: A large snow storm spanning from Texas to Alabama left New Orleans with approximately of snow, Lake Charles with of snow, and Rayne with of snow. However, these are unconfirmed. 1899: With the Great Blizzard of 1899, snowfall in New Orleans reached with strong winds and temperatures below . 2000: This snow was nationally televised as the 2000 Independence Bowl was being played on December 31, 2000 in Shreveport. The game was later referred to as \\"The Snow Bowl\\", as a snowstorm (rare for the Shreveport area) began just before kickoff, blanketing the field in powder, and continued throughout the entire game. 2004: The 2004 Christmas Eve snowstorm swept across southern Texas and Louisiana, leaving unprecedented amounts of snow in areas that had not seen snow in 15 to 120 years. 2008: It snowed in and around semi-tropical New Orleans on Thursday December 11th, 2008. From dawn to mid-morning a thick snowfall of plump, wet flakes buried much of southeast Louisiana, from Amite to Westwego, under a blanket of white. Snow in inches: Lawrence County, MS: 9.0\\" Bogue Chitto, MS: 8.0\\"** Amite, LA: 8.0\\" Washington, LA: 6.0\\" Opelousas, LA: 6.0\\" Covington, LA: 6.0\\" Hammond, LA: 6.0\\" Beaumont, TX: 4.0\\" 2014: The early 2014 North American cold wave that blew through the eastern portion of the continental United States produced record low temperatures and brought freezing snow and sleet to Louisiana. 2017: Early in the morning on December 8, 2017, a winter storm dripped snowflakes on much of south Louisiana. Throughout the day, more and more snow fell. Snow lasted all day long. Heavy snowfall fell on the ground, giving some places a 6-inch snowfall day. Most schools across Louisiana closed due to the snow. State preparedness Because of the scarcity of freezing temperatures in Louisiana, many citizens of the region are often left unprepared to handle what might be considered a storm of little consequence in more northern states. The region has developed a system of road and school closures with only minimal snowfall, as most drivers in the area are unprepared to deal with slick, frozen roads. In fact, the governor of Louisiana may choose to invoke the Louisiana Homeland Security and Emergency Assistance and Disaster Act, R.S. 29:721, to declare a state of emergency due to extreme cold and snow. In 2014, Gov. Bobby Jindal did just that in advance of the weather and assembled teams to assist in preparation and recovery. Louisiana's environment The state's typically humid subtropical climate rarely encounters precipitation coupled with freezing temperatures. The Gulf of Mexico helps maintain this climate, particularly closer to the coast. The normally extreme summers are rarely countered by cold winters, with snowfall low in intensity and frequency. Also the southern portions of the state typically has two seasons, a wet season from April to October and a dry season from November to March. The cooler season typically brings in very little precipitation, also limiting snowfall. Average winter temperature normals in southern Louisiana vary from the 40s to the 60s Fahrenheit. Natural disasters such as hurricanes are far more common, and such an ecosystem is ill prepared for snow, particularly the seafood supply on which Louisiana relies for much of its revenue. Little research has been done directly linking effects on Louisiana's ecosystem to snow conditions. However, the jet stream that created the 2014 North American cold wave has been linked to global warming, and resultant cold fronts have been linked to salt water intrusion in Louisiana's Atchafalaya Bay. However, one of Louisiana's most famous animals, the alligator, has proved versatile in adapting to cold weather conditions by burrowing in \\"alligator holes\\", which they usually use for waiting out a drought. Studies conducted in Finland and Sweden suggest that snow creates more potential problems in urban communities due to increased pollution in runoff. Due to the state's lack of resources and funding, however, it is unclear what levels of pollution due to snow affect the Louisiana area.

Li was a brother-in-law of Emperor Wu, whose favourite concubine was his sister Lady Li, and was the chosen general in the War of the Heavenly Horses. His supplies for his second sortie are described as being 100,000 cattle, 30,000 horses, and many mules and camels.

It is fully functional with the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 home video game consoles. In certain games and demos for the VR, the player wearing the headset acts separately from other players without the headset. The PlayStation VR system can output a picture to both the PlayStation VR headset and a television simultaneously, with the television either mirroring the picture displayed on the headset, or displaying a separate image for competitive or cooperative gameplay. PlayStation VR works with either the standard DualShock 4 controller, PlayStation Move controllers or the PlayStation VR Aim controller. The PlayStation VR has a 5.7 inch OLED panel, with a display resolution of 1080p. The headset also has a processor box which enables the Social Screen video output to the television, as well as process the 3D audio effect, and uses a 3.5mm headphone jack. The headset also has nine positional LEDs on its surface for the PlayStation Camera to track 360 degree head movement. As of December 31, 2019, PlayStation VR has sold-through 5 million units worldwide. History Sony's interest in head-mounted display technology dates back to the 1990s. Its first commercial unit, the Glasstron, was released in 1997.Adam Rosenberg. Sony's long-standing interest in virtual reality gives Project Morpheus an edge, digitaltrends.com, March 23, 2014. One application of this technology was in the game MechWarrior 2, which permitted users of the Glasstron or Virtual I/O's iGlasses to adopt a visual perspective from inside the cockpit of the craft, using their own eyes as visual and seeing the battlefield through their craft's own cockpit.Tony Sperry. Beyond 3D TV, Lulu Pres, Inc., November 2003. In early 2014, Sony Interactive Entertainment research and development engineer Anton Mikhailov said his team had been working on Project Morpheus for more than three years. According to Mikhailov, the PlayStation 3 Move peripheral, itself revealed in June 2009, was designed with unspecified, future head-mounted technology in mind. \\"We specced it and built it to be a VR controller, even though VR wasn't a commodity. As engineers, we just said it was the right thing to do. At the time, we didn't have a consumer-grade project that we could work on, but it was definitely designed with that vision in mind.\\"Sony's Anton Mikhailov on Project Morpheus' launch price and potential as a platform, Edge magazine, April 9, 2014. Shuhei Yoshida, the president of Sony's worldwide studios, also said the project started as \\"grassroots\\" activity among engineers and programmers, which came into focus in 2010 once the Move controller had been released.Jamie Feltham. Project Morpheus Started as 'grassroots activity' Following PS Move's Release, vrfocus.com, December 8, 2014. Sony also went on record to say it is mandatory for all games to have no less than 60 frames per second at all times. Project Morpheus was first announced at The 2014 Game Developers Conference. Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios president Shuhei Yoshida introduced the device on March 18, 2014 and stated Project Morpheus was \\"the next innovation from PlayStation that will [shape] the future of games.\\" On September 15, 2015, it was announced that Project Morpheus would be officially named PlayStation VR. Later in 2015, Sony acquired SoftKinetic, a tech startup whose focus includes visual depth-sensing gesture recognition, for an undisclosed amount. On October 13, 2016, Sony released the PlayStation VR with the price of $399 in the US, ‚Ç¨399 in Europe, ¬£349 in the UK, and ¬•44,980 in Japan.

It features an FOV of 100¬∞, 6DOF head-tracking, stereoscopic 3D, and unwarped output to a TV, either for others to view what the headset wearer sees, or a separate display to compete against the headset user using a standard PS4 controller. In September 2015 it was revealed the headset would have three rendering modes for developers to choose from: native 90 Hz, native 120 Hz, and a mode where gameplay running at 60 Hz would be displayed at 120 Hz using a motion interpolation technique called asynchronous reprojection. The interpolation would be achieved with little system resources and a small latency of under 18 milliseconds. The technique would also be utilised in the native 120 Hz mode to ensure consistent framerate. According to a Sony representative the company expects the interpolated 120 Hz mode to be a popular choice for games. PlayStation VR games can send different perspectives to the headset and television. Shuhei Yoshida, president of SIE Worldwide Studios, explained in regards to a demo by SIE Japan Studio, Monster Escape (in which four players playing off the TV must evade a monster controlled by a player using the headset), that this ability allowed VR to become an asymmetric \\"social experience\\", similarly citing the existing game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes as another example of a VR-compatible game that emphasizes interaction. In November 10, 2017,CUH-ZVR2 full Specifications Sony released the CUH-ZVR2 model of the PlayStation VR which included minor changes, like a slimmer, more streamlined connection cable with different connectors from the CUH-ZVR1 model, and integrated stereo headphones. The newer processor unit also supports HDR video pass through.

Sony announced new information regarding Project Morpheus at the 2015 Game Developers Conference, in line with the official schedule posted on their website and released updated specifications. In an interview with Nikkei Japan in March 2016, Sony indicated the possibility of enabling use of the PlayStation VR in connection with a PC. This would allow the device to work with platforms extending further than the PlayStation 4. Reception Reviews from most publications were positive;Hardware Review: PlayStation VR, metacritic.com critics praised the PSVR's physical design, ease to use, and availability. Compared to other headsets that require high- end computers, the PlayStation VR only required a PS4. Most criticism was aimed at the system's performance, noting the PS4 offers less compute power than the high-end PCs required to run Oculus Rift and HTC Vive games, even though it offers \\"near to PC-quality performance\\". =Sales= As of February 19, 2017, PlayStation VR had sold over 915,000 units.

At times, Embree Shipbuilding employed as many as thirty men and was responsible for building at least five schooners, six brigantines and one barque. Henry Embree learned the craft from his family and became known for his boatbuilding skill. In 1883, H. W.

He is often described as one of the forerunners of twentieth-century conservation biology.Takacs, David. The Idea of Biodiversity: Philosophies of Paradise. Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press (1996). Ehrenfeld's work primarily deals with the inter-related topics of biodiversity, conservation, and sustainability. He is also the founding editor of Conservation Biology, a peer-reviewed scientific journal that deals with conserving the biodiversity of Earth, and has written for various magazines and newspapers including the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and Harper's Magazine.Orion Magazine. http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/mag/contributor/58/. \\"David Ehrenfeld.\\"  Personal life  = Education = Ehrenfeld attended Harvard University for both his undergraduate and medical school studies, where he received his MD in 1963.

His wife, Joan Ehrenfeld, worked as an ecology professor at Rutgers University alongside David for 35 years. Like her husband, she served the scientific community in a variety of ways. She participated in National Science Foundation panels, reviewed articles for scholarly journals, and was appointed as a member of the Science Advisory Board of the United States Environmental Protection Agency.The American Museum of Natural History. http://www.amnh.org/science/biodiversity/extinction/Day2/d2Bios.html. \\"David Ehrenfeld Bio\\" (1998). AAAS fellow Joan Ehrenfeld, an expert on invasive species, wetlands ecology, and urban ecology, died at her home in Highland Park, New Jersey on June 25, 2011, after a year-long battle with acute leukemia.  Career  Throughout his life, Ehrenfeld has written a number of books elaborating on the issues of social ecology and the ever-present dangers of technology. From 1970-1980, Ehrenfeld published Biological Conservation, Conserving Life on Earth, The Arrogance of Humanism, and The Chameleon Variant.Rutgers University. http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~deenr/dehrenfeld.html. \\"Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Natural Resources: David Ehrenfeld\\". New Jersey: Rutgers University (2014). Amid the years from 1980-2009, he published the likes of Beginning Again: People and Nature in the New Millennium, Swimming Lessons: Keeping Afloat in the Age of Technology, and Becoming Good Ancestors: How We Balance Nature, Community, and Technology. The underlying themes in all of his literature are linked in some way or another and serve to portray Ehrenfeld's genuine concern for the progression of human society. = Early work =  Conserving Life on Earth (1972)  The central theme in this book revolves around the idea that biodiversity among species must be preserved in order to maintain a healthy balance in nature and society. Ehrenfeld offers many examples of how natural communities are jeopardized through the actions of humans. For instance, the actions of the United States Army Corps of engineers, which threatened ecosystems within the Oklawaha River valley in Florida, and the numerous problems associated with preserving Pacific Coast Redwood communities, are utilized as case-studies to elucidate the impact of human activity on the environment.Ehrenfeld, David. Conserving Life on Earth. New York: Oxford University Press. (1972). The case- studies are complemented with several discussions of how modern landscapes are changing due to human activities such as agriculture, public construction, and pollution.Bartley, David. Book Review. Journal of Applied Ecology. British Ecological Society (1971) With all of these implications in mind, Ehrenfeld explains why, as a result, extinction rates are higher than ever and that the \\"Sixth Great Extinction‚Äù is currently under way, which has created ecological animosity among local and global communities throughout the world. The ideas expressed by him in this book are similar to those exhibited by ecologists Barry Commoner and Jane Jacobs.Commoner, Barry. The closing circle: nature, man, and technology. (1996).  The Arrogance of Humanism (1978)  Ehrenfeld states that the arrogance exhibited by today's society is attributed to humans‚Äô over-dependence on technology to solve environmental and social problems. He concludes that the intelligence of humans can not simply solve everything and that until humans accept this fact, society will not truly progress. Ehrenfeld utilizes a pessimistic tone in the course of this book in regards to these \\"arrogant\\" assumptions made by modern society. He states that, \\"We must live in our century and wait, enduring somehow the unavoidable sadness ... nothing is free of the taint of our arrogance. We have defiled everything, much of it forever, even the farthest jungles of the Amazon and the air above the mountains, even the everlasting sea which gave us birth.\\"Ehrenfeld, David. The Arrogance of Humanism. New York: Oxford University Press (1978). Environmentalist David Orr accentuates the main points of this book when he states Ehrenfeld's belief that Americans lack the science of land health that Aldo Leopold described in the early twentieth century.Orr, David. http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC27/Orr.htm . \\"What is Education for?\\" (1991). This book is widely regarded as one of Ehrenfeld's most influential works.Jensen, Derrick. Listening to the Land: Conversations about Nature, Culture and Eros. Vermont: Chelsea Green Publishing Company (2002).  Beginning Again: People and Nature in the New Millennium (1993)  Throughout this publication, a wide array of suggestions are offered to perpetuate a more sustainable life in the new millennium. Ehrenfeld urges people of society to embrace a more refined ecological awareness of advancing agricultural technology, carbon dioxide emissions, disappearing fauna, and global biodiversity. As described by philosopher Bryan Norton, \\"The lessons of Beginning Again are usually about the limits of general knowledge and the unlikelihood that expertise will solve the innumerable problems that arise within a society obsessed with information and centralized control.\\"Norton, Bryan. \\"Ecology and prophecy for the new millennium,\\" Bioscience. ProQuest Research Library. 44 (1), (1994). In sum, the underlying message of this story outlines the dangers present in relying on technical expertise to solve the social and environmental problems of today. = Later work =  Swimming Lessons: Keeping Afloat in the Age of Technology (2002)  Similar to the writing style of Becoming Good Ancestors: How we Balance Nature, Community, and Technology, the author employs a number of narratives to establish the main themes present throughout this novel. For example, in his chapter entitled \\"Rejecting Gifts,\\" Ehrenfeld discusses how the values of modern society are steadily deteriorating through the \\"rejection\\" of the perennial gifts that Earth offers to humans such as economically viable resources. Ehrenfeld insists that, \\"The life of contemporary civilization is like the fairy tale of the three little pigs and the big bad wolf in reverse. Having started with a house of brick, we have moved, with great fanfare, to a house of straw; it is hard to concoct a happy ending for such a story.\\"Ehrenfeld, David. Swimming Lessons: Keeping Afloat in the Age of Technology. New York: Oxford University Press (2012), P.35. All in all, the main objective of this book works to emphasize the relationship between technology and the environment while also outlining how corporate economics play an influential role in how the environment is shaped.Ehrenfeld, David. Swimming Lessons: Keeping Afloat in the Age of Technology. New York: Oxford Press (2012). University  Becoming Good Ancestors: How we Balance Nature, Community, and Technology (2009)  A volume pieced together with several anecdotes to portray the overshadowing effects of technology on modern ecological thought. Ehrenfeld goes on to delineate the limits of human capacity and how technology alone will not be able to solve the various environmental issues that society faces today. He draws upon specific examples of how technology will never replace natural energy sources like crude oil. The book as a whole focuses on the effects of modern society on nature and how negative patterns are reversible through the moral judgment and intelligence of humans to make changes that will positively impact the future.Ehrenfeld, David. Becoming Good Ancestors: How We Balance Nature, Community, and Technology. New York: Oxford University Press (2009).  Awards and honors  In his tenure, Ehrenfeld has procured a number of teaching awards. He was elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, was the recipient of the annual award of the Society for Conservation Biology in 1993, and was named the Barbara Munson Goff Rutgers School of Environmental and Biological Sciences Teacher of the Year in 2011.Rutgers University. http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~deenr/dehrenfeld.html. \\"Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Natural Resources: David Ehrenfeld\\".

Formerly the site of the Pulteney Hotel, the property was acquired by Mr. Alexander Baring from William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath in 1821 and rebuilt and renamed after the Earl. History Located at 82 Piccadilly on the western corner of Bolton Street, facing Piccadilly, it ranked alongside Devonshire House, Burlington House, Montague House, Lansdowne House, Londonderry House, Northumberland House and Norfolk House. All of these have been long demolished, except Burlington and Lansdowne, both of which have been substantially altered. In 1858 the house witnessed a marriage of Louisa Caroline as she became Lady Ashburton but by 1866 the Dowager Lady Ashburton relinquished ownership of Bath HouseVirginia Surtees, ‚ÄòBaring , Louisa Caroline, Lady Ashburton (1827‚Äì1903)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 13 Jan 2015 and its contents to her brother-in-law Francis Baring, 3rd Baron Ashburton. His son, Alexander Baring, 4th Baron Ashburton succeeded to the peerage and the property on 6 September 1868 and died at the house on 18 July 1889.

Line 5 is particularly notable for passing under the environmentally sensitive Straits of Mackinac, which connect Lake Michigan to Lake Huron. As of December 2013, the line carries of oil per day. It carries synthetic crude, natural gas liquids, sweet crude, and light sour crude. Route The pipeline runs between two major nodes of the Enbridge Pipeline System at Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario. The Enbridge terminal at Superior conveys western Canadian crude oil from various incoming pipelines (including lines 1‚Äì4) to Line 5 and Line 6, which go around the northern and southern shores of Lake Michigan respectively. From Superior, Line 5 travels east to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, then runs southeast to Rapid River, near Escanaba. At Rapid River, natural gas liquids (NGL) are side stream delivered for stripping, and the stripped NGLs are reinjected. From Rapid River, the pipeline runs near the northern shore of Lake Michigan until it reaches the Straits of Mackinac. There the pipeline divides into two separate lines, which reunite when they reach McGulpin Point on the southern side of the straits. The lines are buried until they reach a depth of . The lines descend to a depth of approximately under the straits. Once on land again in the Lower Peninsula, Line 5 runs near Interstate 75 to Bay City. At the Lewiston pumping station, US sweet crude may be injected. From Lewiston, Line 5 loops around Saginaw Bay, then runs southeast to the St. Clair River. Just before the St. Clair River, Line 5 reaches the Marysville pumping station. Volumes destined for Michigan and Ohio refineries such as BP Husky and Marathon Detroit are offloaded there, and transferred to a Sunoco pipeline that runs from Marysville to Toledo. The line then proceeds east across the St. Clair River to Ontario, where it rejoins Enbridge Line 6 and terminates at Sarnia. Any volumes not destined for Sarnia-area refineries are then pumped into tanks for transfer to Enbridge Line 7. History Mackinac Bridge from Mackinaw City Construction on Line 5 was completed in 1953. The pipelines from western Canada to Superior had been completed in 1950; prior to the construction of Line 5, the crude oil was conveyed from Superior to southern Ontario by oil tankers. In 2013, the line's capacity was increased by per day, from . The upgrade involved US$100 million in improvements to pumping stations, but no change to the actual pipes. In 2018, a tugboat anchor hit the pipeline and caused minor damage to the pipe. Also in 2018, Enbridge and the State of Michigan agreed to build a tunnel beneath the Straits of Mackinac that will contain the pipeline. In 2020, as part of Enbridge‚Äôs seasonal maintenance work on Line 5 in the Straits, a screw anchor support was found to have shifted from its original position. This affected the anchor support and not the pipeline itself. On June 20, 2020, Enbridge reported that on Friday, June 19, 2020, its Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) inspection was completed of the west leg of Line 5 in the Straits and confirmed there were no issues or damage to the anchor structures or pipeline on the west leg. Line 5 in the Straits consists of two 20-inch pipelines, an east leg and a west leg, running parallel to each other for the 4.5 miles across the lakebed. The issue with the screw anchor assembly observed on Thursday, June 18, 2020, was isolated to the east leg, which is under continuing investigation and evaluation over the weekend. As the west leg was not affected, normal operations resumed on that line on Saturday, June 20, 2020, at approximately 2 PM Eastern Time. The east leg was to remain shut down. The federal regulator, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), had no objections to the plan. Enbridge CEO Al Monaco responded to Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to confirm that Enbridge was committed to sharing what is learned about the incident with the screw anchor assembly on the east leg with PHMSA and the State of Michigan. This event was 5 days after latest ruling by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals that cited the emergency response for the pipeline adequate to protect wildlife in the Straits of Mackinac. The pipeline connects Superior, WI, with Sarnia, in the Ontario province of Canada. \\"The controversial project has faced fierce opposition from many conservationists, environmentalists and several Tribal Authorities as a rupture in the pipeline in such a critical area can result in loss of endangered species. The underwater segment is 67-year old and consists of two pipes. The company stated that the pipeline is in a good condition even though the outer coating has worn away in some places and steel braces are placed at places hit by erosion. The company expects a tunnel would provide sufficient safety for the pipeline to remain operational under water. \\"Enbridge intends to commence work on the tunnel once it receives all the necessary permits. Construction of the tunnel is expected to be completed in 2024. Line 5 is a 30-inch 645-mile pipeline.\\" = Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority (MSCA) agreement = On December 19, 2018 the Michigan Department of Natural Resources announced that the Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority (MSCA), in correspondence with outgoing Governor Rick Snyder, approved an agreement to build a multi-purpose tunnel that will house multiple utility lines. In addition, the old Enbridge Line 5 will be removed & a new line will be constructed. Within the agreement the MSCA approved the transfer of a property right, which allows Enbridge to construct the new tunnel in bedrock beneath the Straits of Mackinac. Controversies The 2013 expansion, coupled with the anticipated expansion of the Alberta Clipper pipeline, led to concerns from the National Wildlife Federation and other groups over the possible shipment of diluted bitumen from the Alberta tar sands through Line 5. However, Enbridge has denied any plans to pump such materials. Line 5 ships nearly 23 million gallons of crude oil and petroleum products every day. A 2011 toll agreement describes the materials as \\"condensate, light synthetic, sweet, light sour and NGL,\\" as does a 2013 summary of the Mainline System. Due to national security concerns, however, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration does not divulge the materials actually carried on major US pipelines, including Line 5. Public concerns have particularly focused on the risk of a spill under the Straits of Mackinac, and the difficulty of controlling any spill that might occur. According to Enbridge, the pipes under the straits have never leaked, are monitored 24 hours a day, and are regularly inspected by underwater autonomous vehicles. However, there have been numerous spills elsewhere in Michigan from Enbridge pipelines, including a major Line 5 spill at Crystal Falls in 1999, as well as the 2010 Kalamazoo River oil spill on Line 6. In 2014, it was found that Enbridge was not complying with the spacing requirement for supporting anchors for the pipeline; anchors should be placed at least every 75 feet. In a statement, Michigan Attorney General, Bill Schuette, requested Enbridge to comply with the anchor support regulations, \\"We will insist that Enbridge fully comply with the conditions of the Straits Pipeline Easement to protect our precious environmental and economic resources and limit the risk of disaster threatening our waters.\\" By the end of 2015, eight Michigan counties or municipalities were calling for the retirement of Line 5 including Cheboygan, Cheboygan County, Emmet County, Genesee County, Mackinaw City, Mentor Township, Munising Township, and Wayne County.Oil & Water Don't Mix (2015) \\"Local governments are issuing resolutions calling for the shutdown of the flow of oil in Line 5 at the Straits of Mackinac\\" According to a study published by the University of Michigan, in partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a leak in Enbridge 5 near the Straits of Mackinac could affect roughly 700 miles of shoreline. Key areas recognized for the highest potential risk include Mackinac Island, Bois Blanc Island, Mackinaw City, and areas on the northern shore and southern shore of the Straits. The study found that 3,528 square miles (15%) of Lake Michigan's open water and roughly 13,611 square miles (60%) of Lake Huron's open water could be impacted by visible oil. In addition, highly turbulent flowing currents found within the Straits of Mackinac, combined with the degrading enzymes secreted by zebra mussels, and aging pipe welds and coal tar enamel, increases the risk for corrosion and potential fissures to occur in the pipes. Due to these issues, expert reports concluded that Line 5 should be shut down in the Straits pending a full review under state public trust law. Although the U of M study showcased worst case scenarios, experts recommend completing a risk analysis that includes, \\"1) analysis of environmental impacts, 2) cleanup costs, 3) restoration and remediation measures, 4) a natural resource damage assessment, and 5) Economic damage to public and private sector interests.\\" 2019 lawsuit In late June 2019, the state of Michigan filed a lawsuit asking the Ingham County Court to compel the decommissioning of the segment of Line 5 that runs under the Straits of Mackinac; the dual pipes, in use since 1953, were then shipping 540,000 barrels of oil and propane per day. A Reuters news report defined Line 5 as \\"a critical part of Enbridge‚Äôs Mainline network, which delivers the bulk of Canadian crude exports to the United States\\". The basis of the suit is the claim that the pipeline is a public nuisance and violates the Michigan Environmental Protection Act since it may become the source of pollution. The news report adds that \\"it is unclear if Line 5 could operate without the Straits segment\\". Attorney General Dana Nessel made this comment: \\"We cannot prevent accidental or emergency anchor deployments in one of the busiest shipping channels in the Great Lakes. And it only takes one such incident to cause an environmental and economic catastrophe. That is a risk no one should be willing to take\\". Michigan Senate Republicans expressed concern about the potential shutdown of the pipeline. In their view, that move would create other problems, as reported by The Detroit News.https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/06/27/nessel- court-line-5-environment-risk-shutdown/1582536001/, Nessel to court: Shut down Line 5 as environmental risk > \\"the loss of thousands of construction jobs expected from the tunnel > construction, an increase in costs at Detroit and Toledo refineries and the > loss of a significant mode of propane transportation in Michigan.

Charles Darwin used the term very broadly, giving as an example \\"a plant on the edge of a desert\\" struggling for moisture. The concept of the struggle for existence concerns the competition or battle for resources needed to live. It can refer to human society, or to organisms in nature. The concept is ancient, and the term struggle for existence was in use by the end of the 18th century. From the 17th century onwards the concept was associated with a population exceeding resources, an issue shown starkly in Thomas Robert Malthus‚Äô An Essay on the Principle of Population which drew on Benjamin Franklin's Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc.. Charles Darwin used the phrase \\"struggle for existence\\" in a broader sense, and chose the term as the title to the third chapter of On the Origin of Species published in 1859. Using Malthus‚Äôs idea of the struggle for existence, Darwin was able to develop his view of adaptation, which was highly influential in the formulation of the theory of natural selection.Ospovat, Dov. The Development of Darwin's Theory: Natural History, Natural Theology, and Natural Selection, 1838-1859. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981, 61-86. In addition, Alfred Wallace independently used the concept of the struggle for existence to help come to the same theory of evolution.Petersen, William. Malthus. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1979, 219-223. Later, T.H. Huxley further developed the idea of the struggle for existence. Huxley did not fully agree with Darwin on natural selection, but he did agree that there was a struggle for existence in nature.Paradis, James G. T.H. Huxley: man's place in nature. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1978, 145. Huxley also recognized that a struggle for existence existed between competing ideas within the minds of people engaged in intellectual discussion. This view is an early example of what was later described as meme theory. While the idea of the struggle for existence was developing in the western world, there were other interpretations of the struggle for existence, especially by Peter Kropotkin in Russia.Todes, Daniel Philip. Darwin without Malthus the struggle for existence in Russian evolutionary thought. New York: Oxford University Press, 1989. Also, the struggle for existence was questioned in the United States in the 1930s, as the idea of cooperation among organisms became popular. More recently, it has been argued that the struggle for existence is not as important on macroevolutionary time scales.Bennett, K. D. Evolution and Ecology: The Pace of Life. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997.  Background  The idea of the struggle for existence has been used in multiple disciplines. It became popular in the mid 19th century, through the work of Malthus, Darwin, Wallace, and others. The most popular use of the struggle for existence is in the explanation of the theory of natural selection by Charles Darwin. For more technical information on how the struggle for existence is meshed with the theory of natural selection see the main article for natural selection.  Historical development.  The concept of a struggle for existence goes back to antiquity: Heraclitus of Ephesus wrote of struggle being the father of everything, and Aristotle in his History of Animals observed that \\"There is enmity between such animals as dwell in the same localities or subsist on the same food. If the means of subsistence run short, creatures of like kind will fight together.\\" From translations, the 9th century Arabic scholar Al-Jahiz apparently listed ways in which animals \\"can not exist without food, neither can the hunting animal escape being hunted in his turn\\", similarly \\"God has disposed some human beings as a cause of life for others, and likewise, he has disposed the latter as a cause of the death of the former.\\", In his Leviathan of 1651, Thomas Hobbes described vividly an unbridled human struggle over resources, a \\"war of every man against every man\\" if unrestrained by state power. This was the doctrine of bellum omnium contra omnes. Matthew Hale in The Primitive Origination of Mankind, Considered and Examined According to the Light of Nature (1677) described the struggles of hunter and prey animals. Anticipating Malthus, he proposed that a wise Providence made periodic Reductions in excessive numbers of animals, as with human population \\"to keep it within such bounds as may keep it from surcharging the World\\" so that \\"by these Prunings there may be a consistency in the Numbers of Mankind, with an eternal succession of individuals.\\" The Reductions experienced by humanity were \\"1. Plagues and Epidemical Diseases: 2. Famines: 3. Wars and Internecions: 4. Floods and Inundations: 5: Conflagrations.\\" =Buffon and Franklin, population growth = Population increase causing the struggle for existence was given numerical expression by Buffon in 1751. He calculated that an elm seed would produce a tree which, after 10 years, produced 1,000 seeds. If each were sown, the whole globe would be converted into trees in 150 years. Similarly, \\"if we were to hatch every egg produced by hens for a space of 30 years, there would be a sufficient number of fowls to cover the whole surface of the earth.\\" Taking the example of herrings, if \\"prodigious numbers of them were not destroyed\\" each year they would soon cover the surface of the sea, but they would then be destroyed by \\"contagion and famine\\", so it was necessary and right that animals preyed on each other. Amidst debates on fears of British depopulation, Benjamin Franklin collected statistics of the American colonies which he published in his Poor Richard Improved of 1750 with the question of \\"how long will it be, before by an Increase of 64 per Annum, 34,000 people will double themselves?\\" He concluded: \\"People increase faster by Generation in these Colonies, where all can have full Employ, and there is Room and Business for Millions yet unborn. For in old settled Countries, as England for instance, as soon as the Number of People is as great as can be supported by all the Tillage, Manufactures, Trade and Offices of the Country, the Over-plus must quit the Country, or they will perish by Poverty, Diseases, and want of Necessaries. Marriage too, is discouraged, many declining it, till they can see how they shall be able to maintain a Family.\\" In 1751, Franklin wrote his Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc. proposing a 25-year doubling period in the colonies, an exponential growth in population. Over the following century, this forecast was remarkably accurate. His paper was widely circulated, and had considerable influence: Malthus cited the period as \\"a rate in which all concurring testimonies agree.\\" Franklin's view was optimistic: Those migrating to America would \\"have their places at home soon supplied\\" and \\"increase so largely here\\" that there was no need for other immigrants. =Balance of warring nature= Natural theology continued an earlier theme of harmonious balance between plants and animals. In the late 18th century, naturalists saw the struggle for existence as part of an ordered balance of nature, but they increasingly recognised the fierceness of struggle and the fossil record shook ideas of permanent harmony. Carl Linnaeus saw an overall benign balance, but also showed calculations of the Earth quickly filling with one species if it reproduced unchecked, and referred to \\"bellum omnium perpetuum in omnes, et horrenda laniena\\" (a perpetual war of all against all, and horrible massacre). In 1773 James Burnett, Lord Monboddo, noted that \\"the most fruitful country can be overstocked with any animal and particularly with man\\", and \\"when men were so multiplied that the natural fruits of the earth could not maintain them\\", they could emigrate, prey on other animals or each other, or preferably \\"associate and provide in common what singly they could not procure.\\" In 1775 Kant visualised inner and outer struggle as the impetus for man passing from a rude state of nature to a citizen, Herder in 1784 saw a personified Nature promoting huge numbers of organisms competing for resources so that \\"the whole creation is at war\\", crowding \\"her creatures one upon another\\" to \\"produce the greatest number and variety of living beings in the least space, so that one crushes another, and an equilibrium of powers can alone bring peace to the creation.\\" For William Smellie in 1790 a profusion of animal life improved \\"in proportion to the number of enemies they have to attack or evade\\", and by making animals feed upon each other, the system of animation and of happiness is extended to the greatest possible degree. In this view, Nature, instead of being cruel and oppressive, is highly generous and beneficent.\\" Erasmus Darwin in his Temple of Nature (published 1803) returned to Linnaean imagery, \\"From Hunger's arms the shafts of Death are hurl'd; And one great Slaughter‚Äêhouse the warring world!\\" =Origins of the term= The term struggle for existence was already in use by this time. For example, in 1790 Jeremy Bentham proposed reformed elections as \\"a contest for distinction, not a struggle for existence\\", and in 1795 The Monthly Review used it to describe trees when discussing Thomas Cooper's Some Information Respecting America. In a House of Lords speech on 2 November 1797, Lord Gwydir said they were engaged \\"in a struggle for existence as a nation\\" in the French Revolutionary Wars. Benjamin Disraeli included the phrase \\"a density of population implies a severe struggle for existence\\" in his novel Sybil (1845), which was about the plight of the working class in Britain. = Malthus = 281x281px In An Essay on the Principle of Population, Thomas Robert Malthus argues that a population will increase exponentially if unchecked, while resources will only increase arithmetically. This is seen graphically in the adjacent image and is commonly referred to as the Malthusian curve. Malthus knew that with limited resources on earth, there would be competition among people to exist and survive. He coined the phrase the Malthusian catastrophe to explain how there were positive checks in human populations like famine and disease that kept the population from rising too quickly.Ospovat, Dov. The Development of Darwin's Theory: Natural History, Natural Theology, and Natural Selection, 1838-1859. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981, 61. The checks that exist on the human population growth result in a struggle for existence. Malthus also notes that the checks on the human population are more complicated than those on animals and plants.Petersen, William. Malthus. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 46-56, 1979. Malthus explains, for example, that a human check on population growth is the conscious decision not to reproduce because of financial burden. Malthus then explains that the main check on population growth is food. In periods of high food availability the population increases, while in periods of food shortages, the population decreases.Petersen, William. Malthus. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 56, 1979. Thus, \\"population [growth] tends to oscillate around its means of subsistence.\\"Petersen, William. Malthus. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1979, 56. The combination of Malthus' \\"law of multiplication in geometrical progression\\" and \\"the law of limited population\\" leads to the idea of the struggle for existence. Despite these ideas, Malthus was a religious man and believed in divine laws that governed the natural world. =de Candolle and Lyell= In 1832, Augustin Pyramus de Candolle concisely described the struggle between species of plants in a chapter about parasitism. His friend Charles Lyell quoted this passage in the second volume of Principles of Geology: In this volume, Lyell strongly defended his view that species were fixed against ideas of transmutation of species. To explain adaptation, Lamarck proposed that species did not become extinct, but constantly transformed to suit a changing environment: Lyell believed in essentialism in which species were fixed so could not adapt to change, and became extinct. Hybrids had been proposed as evidence of transmutation; Lyell argued that they would not survive to make new species. pdf : = Darwin = 265x265px Charles Darwin initially shared the belief that nature was perfect and harmonious: after graduating as a student at the University of Cambridge in 1831, he was convinced by William Paley's Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity which saw adaptation as purposeful design and presented population pressure optimistically; \\"it is a happy world after all\\". By mid January 1832, early in the Beagle voyage, Darwin saw geology from Charles Lyell's viewpoint. When the second volume of Lyell's Principles of Geology was delivered to the Beagle that November, Darwin accepted its argument that the \\"struggle for existence\\" disproved transmutation of species. He was reminded of Malthusianism when his sisters sent him out pamphlets by Harriet Martineau. Lyell had been unable to show the mechanism for introducing new species, and towards the end of the voyage Darwin noted that the distribution of mockingbirds found on the Gal√°pagos Islands raised doubts that species were fixed. Early in 1837 John Gould in London revealed that the mockingbirds were separate species: Darwin was spurred into intensive research and the inception of his theory to find the mechanism introducing species. Unconventionally, he sought information from animal breeders. In September 1838, while investigating variation, averages and population statistics, he read Malthus‚Äô An Essay on the Principle of Population, and wrote: That sentence is on page 6 of the first volume of Malthus' Essay, 6th edition: \\"It may safely be pronounced, therefore, that the population, when unchecked, goes on doubling itself every twenty five years, or increases in a geometrical ratio.\\" At first Darwin suggested species competing for resources, six months later he saw competition between individuals of the same species: in mid March 1839 he wrote of the \\"dreadful but quiet war of organic beings. going on the peaceful woods. & smiling fields\\" in which \\"a grain of sand turns the balance\\",Darwin, C. R. Notebook E: CUL-DAR124 pp. 114‚Äì115e 12 March 1839, Darwin Online. a month later he wrote, of the \\"innumerable seeds\\" of a bulrush, \\"if a seed were produced with infinitesimal advantage it would have better chance of being propagated\\".Darwin, C. R. Notebook E: CUL-DAR124 pp. 136‚Äì137 ~~12 April~~ 1839, Darwin Online. He began to see a similarity between farmers selecting breeding livestock and what he came to call natural selection, still thinking of this as a benevolent law ordained to create adaptation. In his 1842 sketch expanding his theory, Darwin wrote that \\"De Candolle's war of nature,‚Äîseeing contented face of nature,‚Äîmay be well at first doubted\\", but \\"considering the enormous geometrical power of increase in every organism\\" countries \\"must be fully stocked\\" referring to \\"Malthus on man\\": later in the sketch he used the phrase \\"struggle of nature\\", and on the back of one sheet \\"struggle of existence\\". In his 1844 Essay Darwin began his section on Natural Means of Selection with \\"De Candolle, in an eloquent passage, has declared that all nature is at war, one organism with another, or with external nature\\", and described this \\"war\\" as \\"the doctrine of Malthus applied in most cases with ten-fold force.\\" In later sections, including the summary, he used the phrase \\"struggle for existence\\", which he had read in several books including Lyell's Geology. On 3 March 1857 he wrote chapter 5 of his \\"big book\\" on his theory, initially headed \\"On Natural Selection\\". The relevant section, titled \\"Struggle of Nature\\" had as an alternative title \\"War of Nature\\". At a later date he changed the chapter heading to \\"The Struggle For Existence As Bearing On Natural Selection\\" and made the section title \\"The Struggle for existence\\", making this his main theme to allow a broader interpretation than one of war between organisms: he used the phrase \\"in a very large sense\\" to include mutual dependency and the physical environmental as when \\"a plant on the edge of a desert is often said to struggle for existence\\" due to its need for moisture. In his \\"Abstract\\" of his book, quickly written and published as On the Origin of Species in 1859, Darwin made his third chapter \\"Struggle for Existence\\" . After \\"a few preliminary remarks\\" relating it to natural selection, and acknowledgement that the \\"elder De Candolle and Lyell have largely and philosophically shown that all organic beings are exposed to severe competition\\", he wrote that: Darwin gradually included the idea that adaptations were not from birth, but rather from external pressures. This describes Darwin's change from teleological explanation to transmutationist thought which was influential the change in Darwin's understanding of nature from 1837 to the 1850s. From Malthus, Darwin claims that the idea of a struggle for existence allowed him to see that favorable variations would be preserved while unfavorable variations would not resulting in the evolution new species. Thus, by the spring of 1837, Darwin had changed from supporting the idea that each species was independently created to supporting the notion that each species was descended from another species - the switch from teleological to transmutationist views. In relation to the struggle for existence, Darwin explains in Origin of Species that \\"forms that are successful in the struggle for existence are deemed to be slightly better adapted than those with which they have had to compete for their places in the economy of nature\\".Ospovat, Dov. The Development of Darwin's Theory: Natural History, Natural Theology, and Natural Selection, 1838-1859. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981, 7. Supporting this claim, in about 1855, Darwin noted that the struggle for existence would produce diversification ‚Äì leading to Darwin‚Äôs principle of divergence. Finally, Darwin stresses the fact that the struggle for existence is a metaphor for the larger natural workings rather than the literal struggle between two individual organisms.Cooper, Gregory John. The Science of the Struggle for Existence: On the Foundations of Ecology. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2003, 3. T.H. Huxley, commonly known as Darwin's Bulldog, clearly explains the struggle for existence in terms of natural selection. Huxley explains that the struggle for existence is concluded based on the fact that populations grow geometrically if unchecked but populations tend to stay constant in number over time. = Wallace = Alfred Wallace and Darwin independently arrived at the theory of evolution by natural selection. Similar to Darwin, Wallace used Malthus's idea of the struggle for existence to reach this conclusion. In addition, Wallace was influenced by Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology.McKinney, H. Lewis. Wallace and Natural Selection. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1972 Lyell discusses a struggle between organisms that causes one species to become extinct; Wallace may have taken the phrase struggle for existence from this example. Additionally, Wallace claimed that it was the collection of chapters 3‚Äì12 of the first volume of An Essay on the Principle of Population that helped him develop his theory. \\"In these chapters are comprised very detailed accounts from all available sources of the various causes which keep down the population of savage and barbarous nations.\\"Petersen, William. Malthus. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1979, 221. Then, in 1853, Wallace first used the phrase \\"struggle for existence\\" when discussing the issue of slavery. By 1855, Wallace had made connections between the struggle for existence and overall population. Wallace saw in Malthus's writing how there are different ways in which a population can be kept in check: \\"From \\"the law of multiplication in geometrical progression\\" (the fact that all species have the power to increase their number up to as much as a thousandfold per year) and \\"the law of limited population\\" (the fact that the number of living individuals of each species typically remains almost stationary), one deduces that there is a struggle for existence.\\"Petersen, William. Malthus. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1979, 220. Wallace combined the idea of the struggle for existence with variation to argue for the idea of \\"survival of the fittest.\\"  Alternative theories: Mutual aid and cooperation  Peter Kropotkin wrote the book Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution in response to the idea of evolution by natural selection. In Russia, the idea of \\"mutual aid\\" was used to explain evolution rather than the struggle for existence. Peter Kropotkin wrote the book Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution in response to the idea of evolution by natural selection.Todes, Daniel Philip. Darwin's Malthusian metaphor and Russian evolutionary thought, 1859-1917. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1987. Print. Due to the vast landscape and lack of population in proportion to land, many people of Russia did not see the struggle for existence and could not relate to Malthus's ideas on population. Thus, it was concluded that cooperation, which is more successful in battling the abiotic environment, rather than competition is a driving factor in natural selection. Rather than a struggle for existence, a mutual struggle and mutual aid drives natural selection. Kropotkin believed that Wallace and Darwin saw the struggle for existence because of their coastal location and overpopulated areas of study. During the 1930s in the United States, a shift in scientific perception caused scientists to lean away from the use of the struggle for existence to explain Darwin's ideas, and more toward the idea of cooperation for mutual benefit.Mitman, Gregg. From the Population to Society: The Cooperative Metaphors of W.C. Allee and A.E. Emerson. Norman : Journal of the History of Biology, 1988, 189. Print. The Chicago School was famous in the 20th century for its study of ecology. At the Chicago School scientists studied the cooperation and competition between organisms‚Äîfindings included that competition worked \\"as both a cooperative and a disoperative force\\" at a population level.Mitman, Gregg. From the Population to Society: The Cooperative Metaphors of W.C. Allee and A.E. Emerson. Norman : Journal of the History of Biology, 1988, 181. Print. Warder Clyde Allee, famous for the Allee effect, also supported this idea that cooperation in addition to the struggle for existence drove evolution. \\"Allee argued that 'individual-against- individual competition, such as brings about the peck-order type of social organization of flocks of hens, may serve to build a cooperative social unit better fitted to compete or to co-operate with other flocks at the group level than are socially unorganized groups.' Competition in this case could be considered cooperative, especially when viewed from the standpoint of group selection.\\"Mitman, Gregg. From the Population to Society: The Cooperative Metaphors of W.C. Allee and A.E. Emerson. Norman : Journal of the History of Biology, 1988, 184. Print. Thus, although the idea of the struggle for existence remained except with the added complexity of cooperation within the struggle. Finally, Alfred E. Emerson supported similar claims around this time period. Emerson saw a struggle for existence on the individual level, but he saw the struggle necessary on a population level for keeping the ecosystem in order. \\"For Emerson, cooperation was important because it contributed to greater homeostatic control; it was homeostasis that was the phenomenon of interest.\\"Mitman, Gregg. From the Population to Society: The Cooperative Metaphors of W.C. Allee and A.E. Emerson. Norman : Journal of the History of Biology, 1988, 187. Print. Emerson believed that \\"what appeared to individual competition at one level might be group homeostasis on another.\\"Mitman, Gregg. From the Population to Society: The Cooperative Metaphors of W.C. Allee and A.E. Emerson. Norman : Journal of the History of Biology, 1988, 188. Print.  Opposition  The main opposition to the struggle for existence came from natural theologists who believed in perfect harmony and perfection.Ospovat, Dov. The Development of Darwin's Theory: Natural History, Natural Theology, and Natural Selection, 1838-1859. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981, 61. The belief that creatures were perfectly adapted to their environment held strong in society, and even Darwin did not abandon this belief until he returned from his voyage on the Beagle. The struggle for existence faced controversy in terms of its political implications.Petersen, William. Malthus. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1979, 70. Malthus was criticized for idea that the poor should practice restraint in marriage. \\"Malthus's criticisms of the Old Poor Law were more hateful to his adversaries than anything else he ever wrote.\\"Petersen, William. Malthus. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1979, 118. Malthus's understanding of the struggle for existence and his writing as a result caused controversy. Additionally, critics said that Malthus \\"never cleared his mind entirely of the dismal theory which he began.\\"Petersen, William. Malthus. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1979, 102.  Present-day application  Today, the struggle for existence is a widely accepted idea that helps to explain and justify the theory of natural selection. However, K.D. Bennett argues that the struggle for existence is only present on geographically small scales. He notes that \\"As climates fluctuate on Milankovitch time-scales, the tendency for populations to increase exponentially is realised, distributions increase enormously, and any struggle for existence is relaxed or eliminated.\\"Bennett, K. D. Evolution and Ecology: The Pace of Life. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997, 188.

Apart from Tarpon Lake they all dry out seasonally. They vary greatly in size and consist of four distinct types: * On the northern and southern coasts, there are several hypersaline lagoons surrounded mainly by mangroves. They comprise the Tarpon Lake complex (236 ha), Grape Tree Pond (10 ha), Jackson's Pond (9 ha), Spot Bay Pond (5 ha), Sandy Point Pond (3.5 ha), Easterly Pond (3 ha) and Rosetta Flats Pond (2 ha). The fringing vegetation consists of varying combinations of four mangrove species mixed with Cordia sebestena, Rhabdadenia biflora and Thespesia populnea. * At the south-western end of the island, near Preston Bay, there are 8.4 ha of brackish wetlands. They support a shrubby vegetation of Conocarpus, Laguncularia and Acrostichum aureum, as well as the herbaceous Rhachiallis americana, Ruppia maritima, Salicornia bigelovii and Sesuvium portulacastrum. * The 8.5 ha Charles Bight Pond, on the eastern bluff, has a monospecific stand of Conocarpus sp. * Coot Pond on the south-eastern coast is a 0.1 ha ephemeral freshwater wetland that supports Conocarpus grassland. =Birds= The IBA was identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports populations of West Indian whistling ducks (with 135 breeding pairs), least terns (with 60 breeding pairs) and white-crowned pigeons.

Early life  She was born Sarah Jo Dashew on October 24, 1972 in Los Angeles, California. Her parents are Stephen and Linda Dashew, and her sister is Elyse Dashew. Her grandfather was Stanley Dashew, well known for creating the plastic credit card industry in the 1950s. When Dashew was four years old, her family left California and spent seven years sailing around the world. Music was almost always playing on the boat, either on the stereo or with locals piled on board playing instruments and singing. Her parents are well known boat designers and authors. When Dashew was 11, the family moved to Ojai, California where she attended public schools and graduated valedictorian from her high school. She graduated from Wesleyan University, where she formed her first band and sang in a gospel choir. After five years of living in Austin, Texas, playing locally and touring in Europe, she moved back to Los Angeles where she met and began to work with Chuck Plotkin.  Career  In 2006, Dashew released her debut album produced by Chuck Plotkin, Jealous Girl. The songs \\"Jealous Girl\\" and \\"Hash it Out\\" were featured on the NBC show My Name is Earl. Of working on her songs with Plotkin, Dashew said ‚ÄúWe would sit on the floor of his boat, slapping our knees and figuring out how to tap into the universe‚Äôs navel.\\" The album received critical accolades from Sing Out! and the Austin Chronicle, among others. In 2008, Dashew wrote two songs for the independent film \\"Blues\\" starring Ari Graynor, which became the starting point for her next album. In 2010 Dashew released the album Where I Belong. America Ferrera chose two songs, \\"Take Me In\\" and \\"Morningtime\\" to be on her celebrity iTunes playlist. During an interview with the Huffington Post about the album and describing her music, Dashew noted \\"I would describe my music as lyrically driven: I'm a lover of words. But not too many words. The music is earthy, a little raw. My voice is not classically trained--there's smoke in there (though I'm not a smoker) and some ache, hopefully some soul. I started out singing in a gospel choir, which explains my love of harmony. I like major keys and I like resolution, so the melodies are usually light. I've been compared to Janis Joplin and Sheryl Crow and Carole King, all of which I take as compliments.\\" In 2013, Dashew released a self-titled album on which she played every instrument, including piano, percussion, accordion, harmonica, bass, acoustic and electric guitars. On March 25, 2014 she released an EP titled Something in the Weather, recorded in her old hometown of Ojai, CA, featuring high school friend and well known drummer Mario Calire. Dashew is also known for physically, emotionally intense live performances. She ends every show with adlibbing and free-styling over a song, culminating in a call for love.  Personal life  Dashew lives in Los Angeles, California, and has a black standard poodle named Luca. She is an avid reader, citing Hemingway as a favorite writer. She is fond of yoga, and is still very involved with boating.

During the war, he and Halleck Tustenuggee, another prominent Seminole leader in the war, met with General Walker Keith Armistead to negotiate, but negotiations broke down and the war resumed. As the war waned, Armistead used money to bribe several Seminole leaders to surrender, but Tustenuggee refused to be bribed and he continued to lead his band in fighting. When the war ended, his Seminole band was one of the few that remained in Florida. In 1843, Tustenuggee and 26 of his followers were forcibly migrated from Florida to New Orleans, Louisiana. They were transported by the USS Lawrence along with 65 other Native Americans and three black slaves. Tustenuggee then committed suicide by swallowing powdered glass.

Born in Chania, he participated in the Cretan Revolt of 1896‚Äì97, studied theology in Jerusalem (1901‚Äì05) and the University of Padova (1906‚Äì11), gaining a doctorate from the University of Bologna in 1911. He served as a chaplain in the Greek expatriate communities of Venice, Trieste and finally Vienna (1920‚Äì36), where he also lectured Modern Greek at the University of Vienna. On 1 March 1936, he was elected as metropolitan bishop of Kydonia (Chania) and Apokoronas and returned to his native island being consecrated on 8 March 1936. During the island's occupation by Nazi Germany in World War II, he played a leading role in the administration of the island, being in contact with both the collaborationist government in Athens as well as the Greek government-in-exile in Cairo. One of the students that attended his lectures at the University of Vienna was the leader of the German invading forces in Crete, Heinrich Kreipe. During the occupation, he was able to place many of his relatives in German offices translating documents for the occupying forces, many of them women. Two of them Eleftheria and Rita Xirouchakis joined the small resistance group led by Manolis Piblis in Hania. Eleftheria spoke three languages, including German, and worked in a German office where she had access to classified documents that she would copy, translate and pass on to her resistance group. On June 11, at a wedding reception, the Germans arrested the siblings except Artemisia who was a baby at the time. During the search of their house, the Germans found a diagram of the \\"Perivolitsa Camp\\" behind a painting on the wall. They interrogated the siblings and Eleftheria took responsibility for the diagram in order to protect her brothers and sisters. Her exact words according to German Lieutenant Volf Sinter were, \\"I am a spy, I work with the resistance group of Piblis and I will not reveal anything else.\\" They were all taken to the prison at the town of Agia where Eleftheria was severely tortured by the Germans Hoffman and Fritz Sterling to reveal her contacts in the resistance. During her interrogation, she was hung naked in the ladies room and beaten repeatedly for three days and nights but did not reveal any information. There was a German guard next to her 24 hours a day to prevent her from sleeping. On July 13, 1944, the Germans executed Eleftheria. Her last words according to the testimony of German nurse Fritz Nider who went to check that she was dead were, \\"Away with your dirty hands so you don‚Äôt pollute a Greek woman. Long live Greece.\\" Kyriako, Manoli and Dimitri were sent to the Dachau concentration camp and Rita was sent to another concentration camp somewhere in Eastern Europe. They all survived and returned to Crete after the war was over. The three brothers returned the same day their parents were having a memorial for them in the belief that they had died. As documented by their descendants in the movie The 11th Day: Crete 1941. On April 4, 2004, the cultural group \\"Omonia\\" honored Eleftheria with a statue at the church grounds in Aroni, Crete. Aside from his religious activities, Xirouchakis was also an active scholar on Cretan history, especially its period as a Venetian colony.

It carries SR 47\\\\. A project to replace the original bridge, which was deemed \\"structurally deficient\\" was scheduled to be completed in April 2016. There is no indication as to whether the new bridge will retain the \\"Price‚ÄìLegg Bridge\\" name. History The bridge first opened in 1952, it was named after Homer Legg, a judge in Lincoln County and J.M. Price, who was a manager of a gristmill in the area. On September, 2011, the Georgia Department of Transportation reported plans to replace the bridge in 2014 in favor of a newer one. The new bridge would be placed from the existing bridge. Dimensions The bridge has a clearance height of . Replacement plans In the early part of the 21st century, the bridge, which is the only direct land- based connection between Columbia and Lincoln counties, was determined to have experienced deterioration due to meteorological conditions and heavy traffic loads. At that time, it was discovered to be \\"structurally deficient\\". However, the bridge was not found to be in danger of collapse; just that cracks were found during inspection. In 2014, the bridge's condition was revamped to only be \\"functionally obsolete\\". The replacement project has been tallied at a $24.1 million price tag. The new bridge was scheduled to be completed by August 21, 2016. As of February 24, 2015, construction was 18 percent complete. A study that was conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers determined that the project would not have a significant effect on recreation activities. However, bank fishing would be hampered. In February 2013, a GDOT report classified the old bridge as \\"fracture critical\\". This was after some boats that were too tall for its overhead clearance collided with the bridge. These collisions left only one bolt holding a torn connection plate in place. The bridge has been inspected on a regular basis. Traffic has been reduced from two lanes to one, from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. to work on the new bridge The lane closures were expected to last about three months. Four foundational piers have been built. The new bridge is planned to have two travel lanes, two emergency lanes, and a vertical clearance. This is compared to the current bridge's .

SR 569 SR 569 was a state route in Williams County connecting US 127 in Jefferson Township to US 20 in Madison Township. In the community of Kunkle, SR 569 intersected a now-defunct segment of SR 246. The route existed from 1938 until 1955 when the entire road became a part of Williams County Road 13. SR 570 SR 570 was a state-maintained section of Neowash Road in southern Lucas County. The route connected SR 295 in Providence Township and US 24 southwest of Waterville. The route existed from 1937 until 1961. Today, Neowash Road is signed as Lucas County Road 143. SR 571 (1937‚Äì1955) SR 571 was a former state route in Bridgewater Township, Williams County connecting US 20 and the Michigan state line. The route existed from 1937 until 1955. The road itself is still a state highway as SR 576 was signed on the entire route after being extended from Montpelier. SR 572 SR 572 was a state route in Lucas County. When it was created in 1937, the route extended from SR 570 near Bailey and ended at US 20 (Central Avenue) near Silica. SR 572 used Hertzfeld Road, heading north to Neapolis- Waterville Road, jogging east to join Finzel Road. SR 572 then traveled north along Finzel Road to Weckerly Road, then north on Weckerly to Maumee-Western Road (US 20A). After jogging east, it used Crissey Road north to its northern terminus at US 20. By 1939, the route was slightly extended at both ends: It was extended on the southern end through Bailey to end at US 24 and was extended to SR 568 (Sylvania-Metamora Road) at its northern end by way of Herr Road, Sylvania Avenue and Mitchaw Road. The route would follow this route until it was deleted in 1945. SR 573 SR 573 was the designation for Mekus Road in northeastern Defiance County from 1939 until 1945. Throughout its history, the entire route was gravel-paved. The route connected SR 66 with SR 580 north of Defiance. Today, all of Mekus Road is a part of Defiance County Road 81. SR 577 SR 577 was the designation for a state route in the Toledo area. The route was first created in 1939, started in downtown Toledo, and traveled northeast along the banks of the Maumee River on Summit Street before turning north at the edge of the Maumee Bay. The route ended at the Michigan state line in Washington Township. In 1942, the route was extended south to Maumee along Summit Street, Broadway and River Road, roads that followed the course of the Maumee River, but not directly next to the river (US 24 followed the road next to the river). By 1946, the section of SR 577 north of downtown Toledo was deleted from the state highway system but was extended further south to SR 64 in Waterville. The route last appeared on official Ohio highway maps in 1951. SR 578 SR 578 was a short state highway connecting SR 65 in Grand Rapids to US 24 in Providence Township via a bridge over the Maumee River. When the route was created in 1937, SR 578 started at SR 33 (now SR 108) south of Napoleon and traveled east through Malinta before turning north to end at US 24 in Grand Rapids. At the time, US 24 crossed to the north side of the Maumee River at the Grand Rapids bridge. By 1942, SR 578 was extended across the river when US 24 was routed on the north side of the river for its entire length. However, by 1945, the entire route only consisted of the bridge and its approaches, the alignment it would use for nearly the next seven decades. In 2012, as a part of the construction of the US 24 freeway in the area, SR 295 was extended from its old southern terminus along the former US 24 to Grand Rapids, taking over all of SR 578. The SR 578 designation was deleted as a result. SR 580 SR 580 was a state highway in Defiance County with a short portion in northwestern Henry County that existed from 1939 until 1957. The route started in the Richland Township community of Independence near the banks of the Maumee River at US 24 to US 6 in Ridgeville Corners. The entire length of the route was paved by 1949. SR 581 SR 581 was a state highway in the eastern portion of Lucas County. The route began at the intersection of Summit Street (SR 577) and Ash Street in Toledo and immediately crossed the Maumee River on the Ash-Consaul Bridge. After crossing the bridge, the route headed east along Consaul Street which turned into Corduroy Road upon leaving Toledo city limits (now a part of the city of Oregon). Near the communities of Reno Beach and Lakeland, SR 581 made a right turn onto Howard Road to end at SR 2 near Bono. The route existed from 1937 until 1939. SR 584 SR 584 was a short state route in southern Ottawa County. Starting at SR 19 in Salem Township, south of Oak Harbor and the Portage River, the route traveled east along West Oak Harbor-Southeast Road for about before ending at SR 53 in Bay Township at the Sandusky Bay. The route existed from 1937 until 1957. The former route is now a part of Ottawa County Road 17. SR 585 (1937‚Äì1939) SR 585 was the designation for the road that currently carries US 20 from the community of Kipton to east of Oberlin. SR 585 started at the intersection of US 20 and what was then the northern terminus of SR 511; it traveled west-northwest until it intersected US 20 again while it was concurrent with SR 10. Created in 1937, it existed for about two years until it was fully replaced by US 20; SR 10 was then extended over the former routing of US 20 through Kipton and Oberlin. SR 591 SR 591 was a state highway in southwestern Seneca County. The route existed from 1937 until 1955 and traveled from Springville at US 23, passed through New Riegel, and ended west of Tiffin at US 224. Today, all of the former route retains its old number as Seneca County Road 591. SR 592 SR 592 was a state route in western Seneca County near Fostoria. The route started at SR 12 and SR 113 in Jackson Township and traveled due east for about where it ended at SR 53 in Jackson Township. SR 592 served the community of Cromers. The route existed from 1937 until 1955. All of the former route and portions of the east-west road west of SR 12 / SR 113 is known as Seneca County Road 592. SR 596 SR 596 was a state route that ran around the northeastern shore of Buckeye Lake entirely in Licking County. The route it used throughout its history from 1937 until 1958 was from SR 157 southeast of Hebron to SR 13 near Edgewater Beach. When the route was deleted in 1958, around the time part of the route was cut off by the construction of Interstate 70, the jurisdiction of the route was transferred to the county and is today known as Licking County Road 596. SR 607 (1986‚Äì2007) SR 607 was a state route in the Proctorville area from 1986 until 2007. The route's southern terminus had always been at the West Virginia state line on the East Huntington Bridge. SR 607 crossed over SR 7 and then looped 180 degrees to end at a T-intersection with SR 7. Around 2005, a road was built stretching north from the northern end of the bridge was built. This new road, which ended away from a newly created intersection with SR 607 at Irene Road was designated SR 607-T. In 2007, both sections of SR 607 were deleted and was replaced by an extension of SR 775 except for the ramp from the north-south road to SR 7, the ramp became a part of SR 7 when it was routed on a bypass of Proctorville. SR 612 SR 612 was the designation for a state-maintained section of West 130th Street in Cuyahoga County. The route started at SR 82 (Royalton Road) on the border of Strongsville and North Royalton and traveled due north. SR 612 traveled along the borders of Strongsville, North Royalton, Middleburg Heights, Parma, Parma Heights, and Brook Park. SR 612 reached SR 17 (Brookpark Road) at the city limits of Cleveland. This intersection served as the northern terminus of SR 612 from 1937 until 1939. After 1940, SR 612 continued north into Cleveland for about to SR 10 (Lorain Avenue). The route was deleted from the state highway system between 1951 and 1953. SR 613 (1937‚Äì1945) SR 613 was a state route in southeastern Cuyahoga County. The route carried Richmond Road from Broadway Road (at the time also SR 14) to Aurora Road (SR 43) in Glenwillow and Solon. SR 613 existed from 1937 until 1945 when it was replaced by SR 175 though today, the road is not state-maintained at all. SR 614 SR 614 was state route in Lake County. The route started at SR 86 in Concord Township, traveled east, and ended at SR 166 (signed as SR 528 after 1940) in Madison Township. The route was signed from 1937 until after 1942. SR 622 SR 622 was a state route entirely in Poland Township that existed from 1937 until 1941. The route started at SR 18 (modern-day SR 289) near the city limits of Struthers and traveled east along New Castle Road (currently Mahoning County Road 106) before ending at the Pennsylvania state line, though the road continues in Pennsylvania as Skyhill Road. SR 623 SR 623 was a state route on the Stark‚ÄìMahoning County county line in existence from 1938 until 1941. The route also formed the border between the city of Alliance and Smith Township. The short route, also called Mahoning Avenue, connected US 62 (East State Street) with East Patterson Street, which was signed as SR 173 while SR 623 existed. SR 627 (1937‚Äì1969) SR 627 was a north-south state route in Stark County. The southern terminus of SR 627 was located in the community of Deerfield (within Deerfield Township) at SR 14, just north of its intersection with US 224. The route traveled due north through several small communities in eastern Portage County. From 1937 until 1941, SR 627 traveled north through the village of Windham before ending at SR 82 in the community of Mahoning. After 1942, due to the opening of the Ravenna Arsenal, the section of SR 627 north of SR 5 in Paris was removed from the state highway system. The route would remain in existence until after 1969 when it was replaced in its entirety by SR 225. SR 628 SR 628 was a short east-west state route connecting SR 8 and SR 43 on East Maple Street in North Canton. From 1937 until 1941, SR 628 extended east from SR 43 along Easton Road (current Stark County Road 86) to end at US 62. For the remainder of the route's history until 1967, the route consisted of the SR 8-SR 43 segment. By 1969, SR 628 was turned over to local control, the same time SR 8 between Canton and Akron was deleted from the state highway system. SR 629 SR 629 was an east-west state highway in central Mahoning County. The route started at SR 45 in Jackson Township and traveled east along Kirk Road. After intersecting SR 46, Kirk Road ended at the Austintown Township‚ÄìYoungstown border, but SR 629 continued south on Tippecanoe Road to end at US 62. The route existed from 1937 until 1941. SR 631 SR 631 was a state route in the vicinity of Northfield that existed from 1937 until 1967. When it was created in 1937, the route ran on Valley View Road from the Cuyahoga/Summit County line on the northern border of Sagamore Hills and traveled southeast through Northfield and Macedonia before ending at SR 91 just north of Hudson. There was a slight realignment at the eastern terminus when the Ohio Turnpike was completed in 1955; the eastern terminus was moved slightly north to avoid crossing over the Turnpike. This would be the route's alignment until about a year before its deletion; SR 631 was truncated to Northfield Center at SR 8 in 1967. Shortly after this, the entire route was deleted from the state highway system. SR 632 SR 632 was the state-numbered route for Fishcreek Road in Stow. Throughout its history from 1937 until 1966, SR 632 always started at Kent Road (SR 5, now a part of SR 59) and traveled northwest to SR 91 (Darrow Road). The road is now municipally-maintained. SR 636 SR 636 was a state highway in western Van Wert County. The route existed from 1937 until 1942 and ran from US 224 in Harrison Township to US 30 in Tully Township. Today, the former route is carried by numerous county and township roads. SR 655 SR 655 was a state highway entirely in Mead Township, Belmont County. The L-shaped route started at SR 147 in the community of Key and traveled south then east to the community of Diles Bottom on the banks of the Ohio River at SR 7. The route existed from 1939 until 1967 and was replaced by Belmont County Road 54. SR 663 SR 663 was a short-lived state highway from SR 13 east of Somerset to Crooksville at SR 75 (now SR 93). The route only existed in 1937 having been created on a local road from SR 13 to Saltillo and then taking over a portion of SR 345 to Crooksville. In the next year, the entire route merged with SR 669, the number the road continues to carry today. SR 670 (1937‚Äì1973) SR 670 was a state route connecting SR 147 near the Senecaville Lake to SR 265 in Salesville. When the route was created in 1937, the route was much straighter than the roads the route would follow later. In 1942, SR 670 was slightly rerouted at its southern end at a point closer to Batesville along SR 147; the route also closely followed the northern shoreline of the lake to Kennonsburg. This alignment would be SR 670's route until 1973. In that year, I-670 was designated in Columbus and due to ODOT not repeating route numbers throughout the state, the route south of SR 313's eastern terminus became an extension of SR 313 and the remainder of the route became SR 761. SR 673 SR 673 was a state route that connected Blue Rock, Muskingum County and Cumberland, Guernsey County and existed only in 1937. The route started at SR 77 (now SR 60 at the Muskingum River and traveled northeast through Ruraldale intersecting the northern terminus of SR 376 and SR 284 in Zeno before ending at SR 146 in Spencer Township. After one year, the entire route became a part of SR 340; prior to this, SR 340 only ran from Cumberland to Coal Ridge.

The Jesuit order, founded by Ignatius of Loyola in 1534, were active participants in the Counter-Reformation, the Catholic fight against the birth of Protestantism. Protestant reformers such as Zwingli in Zurich and Calvin in Geneva divided the predominately Catholic Switzerland. In response, the Jesuits were called in to Lucerne by the city council in 1573 to establish a college. Ludwig Pfyffer, mayor of Lucerne, offered annual financial support to the Jesuits out of his private funds. The Jesuit College of Lucerne was established in 1577 in Ritter Palace, a building originally erected in 1557 as a residence for mayor Lux Ritter. Construction on the associated church began in 1667. By 1673 the shell of the church and the main fa√ßade were completed. The church was consecrated in 1677, though the interior was not yet really finished. Several side altars were still missing and even the high altar was only erected four years later, due to financial problems. The onion topped towers were not completed until 1893.

Records  The colonial government was restored in Venezuela after Domingo de Monteverde's successful taking of Caracas on July 29, 1812, during his reconquest campaign. Monte Verde planned to launch an offensive against the United Provinces of Nueva Granada. However, before he could execute it, two renegade exiled colonels overtook him early the following year. Sim√≥n Bol√≠var began his Admirable Campaign in the West, while Santiago Mari√±o reached the East with exiles from Trinidad Island. Before this desperate situation, Monteverde tried to reconquer Matur√≠n, as the provinces of Guayana, Nueva Barcelona and Cuman√° had fallen to Mari√±o quickly, but he failed on multiple occasions. When he tried to stop Bolivar in the West, he was wounded in battle and was forced to take refuge in Puerto Cabello, where Cajigal relieved him from command. After Bol√≠var took Caracas on August 6, 1813, the Royalist forces were reduced to their positions in the nearby Orinoco Valley, Apure and the Province of Coro.Casa de Col√≥n de Las Palmas. Anuario de estudios Atl√°nticos. N√∫mero 13. Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, 1967, pp. 203. Fortunately for them, the arrival of Brigadier Jos√© Ceballos with 5,000 Spaniard soldiers allowed them to resist the offensive again.Micheal Clodfelter (2002). Warfare and armed conflicts: a statistical reference to casualty and other figures, 1500-2000. Londres: McFarland, pp. 347. . = Campaign = In February 1814, the main threats to the Second Republic of Venezuela were Jos√© Tom√°s Boves's armies in Los Llanos (8,000 men), Jos√© Ceballos in the West (4,000 men) and Juan Manuel Cajigal (3,000 men), who had reorganized their forces after the Admirable Campaign, and were starting their offensive. At the same time, Colonel Francisco Rosete (under Boves' orders) was acting wildly in Valles del Tuy. Given this danger, Santiago Mari√±o finally tried to help Bolivar, but it was too late to contain all their enemies.Thomas Rourke (1942). Man of glory, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Nueva York: Morrow, pp. 124; Thomas Rourke (1942). Bol√≠var, el hombre de la gloria. Buenos Aires: Editorial Claridad, pp. 143. On March 23, the patriot army in the West and its partner in the East, under the command of Bol√≠var and Mari√±o respectively, joined in Los Pilones - currently Gu√°rico State - in order to join forces against the Royalists. However, they remained under separate rule and that would be decisive in their future.Efem√©rides - Los Ej√©rcitos de Oriente y de Occidente Most of Bolivar's troops came from the Andean regions in the west, and Mari√±o's were on the east coast.Carlos D. Malamud Rikles (1992). Las Am√©ricas. Los pa√≠ses andinos: De la Independencia a la Gran Depresi√≥n. Tomo XXXIV. Madrid: Ediciones Akal, pp. 10, . When many of Mari√±o's troops began to desert after the Battle of Bocachica (March 31), Bol√≠var reproached him, even though the same was happening in his own ranks. Also, there were spies from the Royalists in their units. This only increased the tension between the two commanders.Roberto Barletta Villar√°n (2011). Breve historia de Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Madrid: Ediciones Nowtilus, pp. 118. . The Spanish army stopped in Guataparo on May 16 after leaving Coro, just a little more than 4 miles away from the city of Valencia, where Ceballos' army was close by. Cajigal assumed a defensive position as he wished to refrain from attacking until Boves had penetrated into the valleys of Aragua. Bol√≠var left Valencia on May 16 with four divisions, and the next day found Cajigal deployed in combat in Tocuyito: patriots attacked the vanguard enemyEsteves, 2004: 74 but Cajigal avoided combat and withdrew via San Carlos. to give aid to the defeated army of Ceballos in his attempt to take Valencia.Nuestras batallas de Independencia Solomon and other local commanders recognized him as the new Captain General of Venezuela and commander of the Royalist army.Asdr√∫bal Gonz√°lez (1988). La Guerra de Independencia en Puerto Cabello. Caracas: Editora Venezuela en el Mundo, pp. 133 Bol√≠var retreated to Valencia, where he had a better view on the 18th. Cajigal again advanced towards Valencia, reaching the outskirts of the city on May 20. Noticing the proximity of the patriotic forces, he retreated and took position in the savannah of Carabobo. Hereafter, the patriot forces advanced from their positions to the savannah on the 25th,Esteves, 2004. 74 and Bolivar left on the 26th with five divisions and all the horses that were in the city. On the 28th of May, both armies took up positions in the savannah, ready for battle.Esteves, 2004: 74-75  Battle  The war began at 3:00 PM, when the division of Rafael Urdaneta opened fire on the enemy who were trying to outflank the Royalists to the right, but this was a trick to distract Cajigal. The main attack occurred straight on with Jos√© Francisco Berm√∫dez, Juan Manuel Valdes and Florencio Palacios advancing. The Royalist Forces resisted for about one hour, under heavy cross-fire, until their center began to break. Then, Marshal Cajigal sent his best troops in, the Carabineros de Granada, to protect that position. In response to this, Bol√≠var ordered to Santiago Herrera to let the cavalry of Jos√© Gregorio Monagas, John Josephus Rondon and Lucas Carvajal attack the Grenadian army while Diego Jalon's patriot artillery dedicate themselves to bombard the Royalist Staff position, forcing them to relocate several times without the possibility to react. After being attacked by the Patriot Lancers' cavalry, the Granadians started to retreat, dragging along with them the Royalist infantry, which broke ranks and fled in panic.Esteves, 2004: 75 The battle ended at 6:00 PM. Cajigal tried to organize an orderly retreat, which was made impossible by the Republican cavalry, which attacked from all sides. The marshal and his staff were barely able to escape with a couple of men.Esteves, 2004: 75-76  Impact  Ceballos moved to the East. Cajigal escaped to Apure and granted broad powers to Boves to continue this campaign, but he retired to Los Llanos to take care of his elderly grandmother who was sick with tuberculosis.Manuel Guevara Baro (2007). Venezuela en el tiempo: cronolog√≠a desde la Conquista hasta la fundaci√≥n de la Rep√∫blica. Tomo II. Caracas: El Nacional, pp. 51. . The battle could have been decisive for Venezuelan independence, but Bol√≠var, instead of moving to Gu√°rico against Cajigal to end the rebellion of the llaneros with his entire army, which would have been the most sensible decision, opted to divide them. He ordered General Rafael Urdaneta to march to the West with 700 infantrymen. He sent a division of 400 infantry and 700 cavalry after Cajigal and Ceballos to prevent them from supporting Boves.Bartolom√© Mitre (1990). Historia de San Mart√≠n y de la emancipaci√≥n sudamericana. Tomo II. Corrientes: El Tacur√∫ de Corrientes S.A. Ediciones Sanmartinianas, pp. 764. . He decided to go to Valencia, Jos√© F√©lix Ribas was sent to reinforce Caracas and Santiago Mari√±o was stationed in Aragua with 3,000 men. Mari√±o camped in Villa de Cura, where he could attack Los Llanos, a Royalist stronghold. Meanwhile, Jos√© Tom√°s Boves left with a powerful army from Calabozo in a campaign that ended in the Second battle of La Puerta.  References   Bibliography  * Edgar Esteves Gonz√°lez (2004).

History In 2007, this family was recognized as distinct from the genus Mycosphaerella, where it had previously been located, based on phylogenies constructed with the Large Subunit (LSU) of ribosomal DNA. In general, many fungi in the Mycosphaerellaceae and Teratosphaeriaceae are thought to be widespread, yet there is still little known about their individual distributions or the range of hosts that they inhabit. After the family was formally split out from Mycosphaerella in 2007, many new species have been described in this family including a number of causal agents in leaf diseases and stem cankers of Eucalyptus in Uruguay and Australia. Habitat This family of fungi is notable in that it contains a number of extremeotolerant, so-called black yeast fungi. A number of these black yeast fungi in the Teratosphaeriaceae are considered 'rock-inhabiting', and manage to survive on the often-harsh exposed surfaces of rocks in a range of extreme climates, including in Antarctica. While some of the members of this family live in harsh environments, including the newly described genus Acidiella that grows in highly acidic soils (pH < 3) in Europe, other closely related species are found as lichens or on plant surfaces. This family, for example, contains a number of previously recognized leaf spot pathogens and endophytes. Sequences from the plant pathogen Teratosphaeria microspora were even found in a high-throughput screen of fungal spores in indoor dust.

Rapallo was occupied by 4,000 Neapolitan troops on 3 September 1494 with Giulio Orsini, Obietto Fieschi, and Fregosino Campofregoso in command, their plan being to force a rebellion in Genoa. Later the Neapolitan fleet was forced away by bad weather. On 5 September, Louis d'Orleans landed with 1,000 Swiss mercenary infantry which was later reinforced overland by 2,000 more Swiss mercenaries and a contingent of Genoese-Milanese infantry. A skirmish broke out between the Swiss mercenaries and Neapolitan forces, though the terrain did not allow for the Swiss to form up their pike squares. However, the battle was mainly fought between the Genoese-Milanese and Neapolitan infantry. Following concentrated artillery fire from the French fleet, the Neapolitans were routed. The Swiss massacred Neapolitans trying to surrender, although Orsini and Campofregoso were captured in the retreat. After the battle the Swiss mercenaries killed the enemy wounded and sacked the town of Rapallo. Though a small battle, it was seen as a significant victory which halted Neapolitan attempts to incite a rebellion in Genoa against the French.

In his nomination speech, Atkin made accusations against Cribb, who replied vigorously defending himself. The somewhat unexpected outcome of this verbal exchange was that Cribb announced he would withdraw his nomination. Cribb said that if Atkin believed he could represent them so well, the best thing they could do would be to let him try, predicting that Atkin would either resign or be asked to resign within six months. Being the only remaining candidate, Atkin was declared elected. Cribb's six-month prediction did not come true.

Unusual for modern American horse trainers, he is based year-round at Keeneland Race Course and does not move his training stable from track to track throughout the year. He chooses to give his horses time off in the winter and does not race-year-round. Background Lopresti was born in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in Smithtown, a suburb of New York located on Long Island. His first exposure to horses were the pleasure horses of his uncle. LoPresti then spent time around hunters, jumpers, and driving horses, only becoming interested in Thoroughbred racing as a young adult. At the age of 19, he attempted to find work on a Thoroughbred farm in Virginia, but the job was taken already. However, the employer there recommended him for a job with trainer Joe Cantey, who was at Belmont Park back in New York. Cantey was also the first husband of horse racing sports analyst Charlsie Cantey. LoPresti stayed there for two years, and in 1978 moved to Lexington, Kentucky, where he worked for Ted Carr at the Domino Stud and learned about the Thoroughbred industry from the ground up. He also worked for Carr for about six years as an assistant manager at Brookside Farm, then owned by Allen Paulson While working at Domino Stud, he met his wife, then named Amy Featherston. LoPresti next worked as a trainer at Calumet Farm, starting their young horses. He then sent the young horses on to the track where they were further developed by people such as Bill Mott and Frank L. Brothers. During his six-year tenure at Calumet, he met race horse owner Bob Lewis, who asked him to help rehabilitate a horse named Competitive Edge who had undergone surgery in 1992. When that horse returned to the track a winner, the owner of Calumet, Henryk de Kwiatkowski, suggested that LoPresti begin to train some of Calumet's racing stock directly for the track. As a result, LoPresti became a licensed trainer in 1993. When the management of Calumet changed, the husband and wife team of Charles and Amy LoPresti went out on their own. They originally established themselves with a very good reputation for starting yearlings as race horses. Among the young horses they started in training was Lewis' horse Charismatic, winner of the 1999 Kentucky Derby. Today, the LoPrestis run a 200-acre horse facility in Lexington called Forest Lane Farm. They start about 25 to 30 yearlings each year and house their race string there in the off-season. Amy LoPresti continues to manage Forest Lane while Charles LoPresti handles their race horse training at Keeneland, which is about 15 miles from their farm. In his spare time, LoPresti enjoys the western riding sport of team roping and working cattle with horses. Major horses After years of modest success on the track, LoPresti won his first graded stakes race in 2009 with Successful Dan, a half- brother to Wise Dan. Successful Dan earned nearly $1 million, and his wins included four graded stakes races. LoPresti's first Grade I stakes win, however, occurred in 2010 with Here Comes Ben. His next successful horse was Turallure, who earned over $1 million, winning the Woodbine Mile in 2011 and finishing second in the 2011 Breeders' Cup Mile. LoPresti followed up Turallure's success by winning both races in 2012 and again in 2013 with Wise Dan. Wise Dan is the most successful race horse LoPresti has trained and raced. He started the colt in 2010 as a three-year-old and accumulated a record of 23 wins and earnings of over $7.5 million by the end of Wise Dan's career. In the 2012 World Thoroughbred Rankings, Wise Dan was assigned a rating of 129, making him the best horse trained in the United States and the fifth-best racehorse in the world. At the Eclipse Awards for the 2012 season, he was voted Champion Male Turf Horse, Champion Older Male Horse, and American Horse of the Year. He was the first horse to win all three awards since John Henry in 1981. In the 2013 rankings, Wise Dan was given a rating of 129, making him the third-best racehorse in the world, the best miler, and the best racehorse in North America. He repeated his successes of the previous year in the Eclipse Awards for 2013, being voted Champion Male Turf Horse, Champion Older Male, and Horse of the Year.

It is based on Henry Miller's 1934 autobiographical novel Tropic of Cancer. The film stars Rip Torn, James T. Callahan, David Baur, Laurence Lign√®res, Phil Brown and Dominique Delpierre. The film was released on February 27, 1970, by Paramount Pictures. Strick had previously adapted other controversial works of literature ‚Äì Jean Genet's The Balcony and James Joyce's Ulysses. Though the book came out in 1934, the film is set in the late 1960s when Paris, while little changed visually, was a very different place. Filming took place on location in Paris, produced by Joseph Strick with some help from the author, whose persona was portrayed by Rip Torn and his wife Mona by Ellen Burstyn. The novel had provided a test for American laws on pornography and the film was rated X in the United States, which was later changed to an NC-17 rating in 1992. In the UK the film was refused an 'X' certificate by the BBFC. Plot Henry Miller, a writer from New York whose money has run out, lives in Paris on the generosity of American friends who give him food and a space to sleep. His wife Mona crosses the Atlantic to see him, but soon leaves when she realises the hopelessness of his position. When he does wheedle a bit of cash, he spends it on drink and women. He finds a job, providing bed and board though no pay, as a teacher of English at a boy's school in Dijon, but soon leaves. Another opportunity is to mentor a wealthy young Indian, which again does not last. Finally he lands a proper job with an American newspaper and becomes friends with another expatriate, Fillmore. From a rich family, Fillmore has got involved with Ginette, possibly a prostitute, who is possibly infected and probably pregnant. He suffers a mental breakdown and is hospitalised. Once he is released, Henry persuades him to head back fast to the USA, promising to take care of Ginette. When Fillmore gives him 500 francs for Ginette, Henry realises that, despite his love for the Old World and the freedom he has enjoyed there, he too could now head back fast to the USA.

The song peaked at number 2 on Billboard's K-Pop Hot 100. Apink won six music show trophies for \\"Mr. Chu\\" and wrapped up promotions for Mr. Chu on May 25. The song was the eighth best selling digital song in 2014, according to Gaon's year-end chart. \\"Mr. Chu\\" was used for G9 TV commercial featuring Apink and comedian Lee Guk-Joo. The Japanese version of \\"Mr. Chu\\" was released as their second Japanese single on February 18, 2015. On January 22, 2015 the short PV for \\"Mr. Chu (on-stage)\\" Japanese version was released. Release On March 20, Apink released member teaser photos for their fourth mini album Pink Blossom. The photos came with the news that the title was called \\"Mr. Chu\\", an upbeat dance track composed by Duble Sidekick, David Kim and Seion. Mr Chu is named after the boss of Plan A Entertainment, Apink's parent company. This reflects the hardship of the group during their trainee days, where they had to kiss the eponymous Mr. Chu at the start of training everyday. On the following day they released a video teaser featuring Apink members participating in a photo shoot for the new album cover using the instrumental version of \\"Mr. Chu\\" as the background music, giving the first preview for the song. On March 24, a medley clip was released, giving a short preview of all six tracks of the upcoming album.  Music video  On March 27, A Cube uploaded a twenty six-second teaser trailer for the music video of \\"Mr. Chu\\" on Apink's official YouTube Channel. The teaser features Apink members dressed in tennis outfit holding presents on their laps while watching a tennis match played by the \\"Mr. Chu\\". The full music video was released together with the 4th mini album Pink Blossom on March 31. The music video was directed by Digipedi Studio. The shooting lasted 24 hours in a studio located at Gyeonggi-do area. Digipedi used complementary colors with graphic layouts and fixed cuts to make each short story. The music video starts with a single close up of all of the girls and a mysterious man picking up a tennis ball. Throughout the music video, it seems like Mr. Chu is pointed out to be the popular guy who plays tennis while the girl watching attentively. The girls can be seen squeezing love letters and gifts into his locker that already stuffed with presents. At the end of the music video, they show the calendar of March with all dates being crossed off until a kiss mark on the 31st, pointed out to the day the music video was released. A choreography practice video for \\"Mr. Chu\\" was released on May 29. Performances Apink performed \\"Mr. Chu\\" for the first time at KBS's Music Bank on April 4, together with a snippet of another track from their album, \\"Sunday Monday\\" This was followed by additional comebacks on music programs including MBC's Show! Music Core, SBS's Inkigayo, MBC Music's Show Champion and Mnet's M! Countdown. On April 7, industry professionals reviewed Apink's comeback stage on the three public broadcasts and SBS's Inkigayo comeback stage was chosen to be the best one. One choreographer said, \\" The camera work was perfect. Because a lot of the choreography in 'Mr. Chu' has Apink putting their hands near their face, close up shots are necessary to show the entirety of the choreography well. The camera work on Inkigayo did the close-up better than the other two shows. Plus, Apink's live performance was especially strong on this stage.\\" On April 16, Apink decided to halt promotional activities and cancel all their schedules including their third anniversary fanmeeting on April 19 to pay respect for the victims of Sewol Tragedy. A Cube Entertainment released a statement, \\"Due to the magnitude of the passenger ship sinking, Apink felt too much pain and did not think they could sing for their fans with a light heart, which is how this decision came to be made. We plan on having the canceled fan meeting some other time in the future and will later announce the new date and location.\\" The group resumed promotions after 3 weeks, performing at Mnet's M! Countdown on May 8. They wrapped up promotions for Pink Blossom on May 25.  Reception  = Critical reception = One music representative stated, \\"Sexy girl groups poured out in January and February and came out with similar sexy concepts that can get tiring. But Apink used the idea of purity and brightness for their music, which is appealing to the listeners.\\" While Jeff Benjamin reviewed, \\"Continuing Apink's slew of bubblegum-pop singles, \\"Mr. Chu\\" doesn't necessarily push Apink into new or unexplored territory. Rather, \\"Mr. Chu\\" seems to be a way to try to further solidify themselves as K-pop's ultimate sweethearts.\\" One of the reasons behind the group's decision to continue with its bright and innocent concept instead of following the trend of sexy concept was their fans. During an interview, Apink said, ‚ÄúThe first teaser we released was the album cover photo. We were wearing red lipstick in the photo and so many fans were worried that we might change our concept from before.‚Äù This decision had positive responses from public and fans as \\"Mr. Chu\\" topped various music sites‚Äô real-time charts as soon as it was released. = Awards = On April 8, 2014, \\"Mr.Chu\\" won first place on the MBC Music music show, Show Champion. It was Apink's second win on the show after \\"NoNoNo\\" in 2013. On April 9, \\"Mr. Chu\\" won first place on the Mnet's M! Countdown, It was Apink's second win after \\"My My\\" in 2012 and on the next day, the song won another first-place trophy on KBS's Music Bank K-Chart, Apink's second win on the show after \\"NoNoNo\\" in 2013. On April 11‚Äì12, Apink ended the week with full sweep of the week's music shows with their first trophies from MBC's Show! Music Core and SBS's Inkigayo. The song got its second first-place trophy from M! Countdown after the show returned to broadcast after a three- week-long hiatus on May 8, making a total of six trophies for \\"Mr. Chu\\". In November 2014, Apink received \\"Best Female Dance\\" for \\"Mr. Chu\\" at the Melon Music Awards. In January 2015, \\"Mr. Chu\\" received a Bonsang Award at Seoul Music Award =Chart Performance= \\"Mr. Chu\\" entered the Gaon Digital Chart at number 2 in the first week of its release and the song became the eighth best selling digital song in 2014 on Gaon's year-end chart. The song peaked at number 2 on Billboard's K-Pop Hot 100.  Commercial  \\"Mr. Chu\\" was used for G9 TV commercial featuring Apink and comedian Lee Guk-Joo. In the commercial video, Apink started with dancing the choreography of \\"Mr. Chu\\" and Lee Guk- Joo entered and dance a comical dance along with the song. Japanese version On 19 December 2014, Apink announced they would release a Japanese version of \\"Mr. Chu (on stage)\\" for their second Japanese single on 18 February 2015, 4 months after the release of their debut single \\"NoNoNo\\". Four different cover photos for \\"Mr. Chu\\" album cover were released on January 14. On January 22, 2015 the short PV for \\"Mr. Chu\\" 'on-stage' Japanese version was released through Universal Music YouTube channel ahead of their comeback. The music video used similar tennis theme concept just like the Korean version. In the video, the group wears a pink tennis dress and black-and-white school uniforms. The video features Apink members dance to the song chorus, use their signature moves of blowing kisses at the tennis court. On February 18, Universal Music Japan released \\"Mr. Chu\\" as a CD single with \\"Hush\\" as a B-side. Instrumental versions of both songs were also included.

For the album's promotion, the group launched album release events in Tokyo, Fukuoka, Osaka and Nagoya. The release events, which took place in the forms of fan meetings successfully sold out all seats and gathered around 9,300 people. The single debuted at number three on Oricon‚Äôs daily album chart and climbing up to second place on the next day ranked behind \\"SMAP\\" the nation Japanese Boygroup. They ranked second on Oricon single weekly chart, sold 54,161 copies on the first week. They broke their own record since their Japanese Single Debut, \\"Nonono\\" only managed to peak at no 3 at the Oricon weekly chart last November. \\"Mr. Chu\\" enters at No. 89 on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 on the first week and climbing up to no. 5 for the week after.

He was diagnosed with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in 1985 in New York City, New York. As a member of the Lavender Hill Mob, a forerunner to the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), he was among the first AIDS activists to protest responses to the disease. He was a co-founding member of ACT UP in New York City, New York, and later helped organize ACT UP chapters in Portland, Oregon, Washington, D.C., and New Hampshire, as well as the ACT UP Presidential Project. Petrelis was also a founding member of Queer Nation/National Capital, the Washington D.C. chapter of the militant LGBTQ rights organization. In 1990, he organized a nationwide boycott of products manufactured by Philip Morris Companies, Inc. (now Altria Group, Inc.), including Marlboro cigarettes and Miller beer, to protest the company's support for Jesse Helms, a Republican senator from North Carolina whose rhetoric and policy positions Petrelis said were harmful to LGBTQ communities. Petrelis was among several activists who disclosed, in 1989, that Mark Hatfield, a Republican senator from Oregon who supported anti- gay legislation, was secretly gay, the first such political outing of an elected official by American activists. Over the next few years, Petrelis became an outspoken proponent of outing and one of its most prominent practitioners; at a 1990 press conference on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, he outed a dozen public figures, although no news outlets published the names, and he played a pivotal role in the 1991 outing of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Pete Williams by writer Michelangelo Signorile in The Advocate, an American LGBT-interest magazine. When Terry M. Helvey and an accomplice murdered Helvey's shipmate, U.S. Navy Seaman Allen R. Schindler, Jr. in October 1992, because Schindler was gay, Petrelis traveled twice to Japan to press the Navy for justice on Schindler's behalf and to monitor the trial, while raising awareness of the hate crime in the U.S. After relocating to San Francisco, California, in 1995, Petrelis successfully lobbied the city's Department of Public Health (SFDPH) to make the female condom available to gay men, and advocated reopening the gay bathhouses there. He also founded the AIDS Accountability Project, a watchdog organization that obtained IRS tax forms 990 from nonprofit AIDS service organizations, then published the financial information disclosed therein online. He currently lives with his partner of eighteen years, Mike Merrigan, and writes a blog called The Petrelis Files. On April 5, 2014, Petrelis announced his candidacy for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, running against incumbent Scott Wiener for the District 8 seat, representing the Castro, Noe Valley, Diamond Heights, and Glen Park neighborhoods of San Francisco. In January 1999, Out magazine included Petrelis in the Out 100, recognizing him, for creating the AIDS Accountability Project, as one of the \\"people who defined 1998\\". In August 1999, The Advocate named Petrelis among its \\"Best and Brightest Activists\\" citing the AIDS Accountability Project and other controversial causes. Early years and influences Petrelis was born in Newark, New Jersey, where he lived for \\"four or five\\" years before his family moved to Caldwell, a nearby suburb. According to a family legend, his maternal grandmother once created a scene when his mother failed to win a Shirley Temple look-alike contest in Newark, overturning the judges' table and screaming, \\"This is a mafia-rigged beauty contest! My daughter's the most beautiful one!\\" Petrelis said of the legend, \\"...of course, I wasn't there, and you don't necessarily inherit that kind of whatever it takes to do it, but sometimes, you've just got to overturn some tables and remember that, for me, I have a Mediterranean background and that anger is okay.\\" Petrelis attended an alternative high school in East Orange, New Jersey, where he was openly gay. He remembers first becoming involved with the gay community as a teenager, traveling to the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City. In the city, Petrelis discovered he could make money as a sex worker and engaged in \\"lots and lots of unsafe sex.\\" After graduating high school in 1977, he spent the following summer hitchhiking across the United States to San Francisco, California, where he lived for the next three years. In San Francisco, Petrelis witnessed the White Night riots at San Francisco City Hall, a reaction to the lenient sentencing of Dan White, convicted of killing San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and openly gay Supervisor Harvey Milk. Petrelis remembers feeling outrage on hearing the news of White's sentence and said of the property destruction he had watched that night, \\"I remember feeling that was okay ‚Äî that you had to have this destruction of personal property to send a message...to gay people here in San Francisco‚Äî [White's lenient sentence] is not okay. And we had to look out for ourselves ‚Äî even with the relative liberal attitudes of San Francisco.\\" Petrelis moved to New York, in 1981, where he renewed his acquaintance with a male couple he knew from his teenage visits to the city. One of these men was the first of Petrelis' friends to die of the disease that would later come to be known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS diagnosis Through the early months and spring of 1985, Petrelis suffered from a persistent illness that one doctor diagnosed as influenza; by that summer, he had developed a \\"bump\\" on his arm and was referred to a dermatologist at New York University (NYU) Hospital. At first, Petrelis balked; earning his living as a temporary office worker, he had neither insurance nor money to pay a dermatologist. Urged by the referring physician, he relented. At NYU Hospital, Dr. Patrick N. Hennessey removed a biopsy of the suspicious lesion and stitched the incision. Petrelis remembered not wanting to return to have the stitches removed, again for lack of insurance and money, assuming that \\"if there's bad news, they'll call me up and tell me.\\" When Hennessey's office did call and insisted Petrelis must see the doctor, he resolved to \\"...worry about payment later.\\" On the afternoon of August 26, 1985, Petrelis returned to Hennessey's office for removal of the stitches. Hennessey explained the results of the biopsy: the lesion was Kaposi's sarcoma, an opportunistic infection. He told Petrelis he had AIDS and that more such opportunistic infections would follow. His prognosis was terminal, with six months to a year to live. Henley advised him to go to the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) as soon as possible, draft a will, and find a doctor. Introduction to activism Upon hearing news of Petrelis' AIDS diagnosis, the friend with whom Petrelis lived asked him to leave; he was soon sleeping on numerous friends' couches and engaged in his first campaign: to pressure the city to support the AIDS Resource Center's (ARC) proposed purchase of the River Hotel on Christopher Street at the West Side Highway. With help from Mayor Edward Koch's administration, ARC planned to open the first residence for people with AIDS in the United States. Also active in the campaign were Andy Humm of the Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Rights (CLGR), Buddy Noro of People With AIDS, and Bill Bahlman and Marty Robinson of the Gay and Lesbian Anti-defamation League (now the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, or GLAAD). Robinson, whom Petrelis remembered meeting by chance one night outside New York City's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center on West 13th Street, as the two men waited for a GLAAD meeting to begin, was a veteran activist. Throughout the 1960s, he had been active in the Mattachine Society, one of the first homophile organizations in the United States. He was present at the Stonewall Inn, a Greenwich Village bar, when officers from the New York City Police Department raided it on June 28, 1969, sparking the resistance known as the Stonewall riots, and he was a featured speaker at the subsequent rally in Sheridan Square, attended by two thousand people. In the aftermath of the Stonewall riots, he co-founded the Gay Activist Alliance (GAA), where he was credited with developing the zap, a protest tactic that would become a central component of ACT UP's strategy. Frustrated with what Bahlman called the \\"timid sort of nature\\" of GLAAD's and CLGR's tactics in the face of the AIDS crisis, Robinson and Noro determined that they needed to start a new group. In the late summer of 1986, in the wake of the Supreme Court of the United States' ruling in Bowers v. Hardwick, they began meeting with a small group of friends at Bahlman's apartment. In addition to Robinson, Noro, and Bahlman, early participants included Henry Yaeger Jean Elizabeth Glass Eric Perez, and Petrelis. The group would come to call itself the Lavender Hill Mob, after a well-known comic British film ‚Äî a title they believed captured the personality of the group and its actions: gay, confrontational, creative, and humorous. Petrelis recalled, during this time, attending a community meeting at St. Vincent's Hospital at which he, alone, confronted Koch advisor John LoCicero and Carol Greitzer, Councilwoman from New York City's Third District where the River Hotel was located. Petrelis believed Greitzer was \\"dragging her heels on this deal\\". Without waiting for the question and answer session, and without fear of arrest, Petrelis says he \\"just let them have it.\\" Petrelis also helped organize a Lavender Hill Mob demonstration, camping overnight in a tent outside Gracie Mansion, to protest the city's year-long delay in approving the contract and signing the paperwork for the River Hotel project. Bahlman believed the protest was instrumental; the city approved the contract within days. Named Bailey House in honor of the Reverend Mead Miner Bailey, one of ARC's founders, the facility finally opened on December 10, 1986. Petrelis was among its first residents. Lavender Hill Mob's opposition to mandatory AIDS testing On February 24, 1987, Petrelis traveled with Bill Bahlman, Eric Perez, Marty Robinson, and Henry Yaeger to Atlanta, Georgia, where the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) had convened the largest meeting yet held on the subject of AIDS. Eight hundred state and federal health officials attended the two-day conference to discuss proposed CDC guidelines for the use of AIDS antibody testing in preventing the spread of the disease; specifically, the CDC was considering whether to recommend such testing of patients admitted to hospitals, patients seeking clinical treatment for family planning, drug addiction or sexually transmitted diseases, prison inmates, and couples planning to marry. On the first afternoon, Petrelis, dressed in a mock concentration camp uniform with a pink triangle, told a panel on confidentiality, \\"There's no such thing as confidentiality. I can tell you, as soon as you get on Social Security, your disability is AIDS, and everybody knows it.\\" Petrelis accused federal health officials of genocide in mishandling the AIDS epidemic and said, \\"You locked up the Japanese during World War II, and you'll do it again if you want to. You should start talking about new treatments.\\" Lavender Hill Mob members also passed out leaflets that said \\"Test drugs, not people,\\" and referred to the CDC as \\"Center for Detention Camps.\\" Lavender Hill Mob members interrupted CDC deputy director Walter Dowdles' concluding remarks on the second day of the meeting, forcing the final plenary session to an early end with a \\"noisy demonstration accusing federal health officials of Nazism and genocide for debating the use of the AIDS test while people are dying for lack of a cure.\\" The Lavender Hill Mob also criticized representatives of established lesbian and gay organizations attending the meeting, interrupting their joint press conference on the second day of the meeting. Urvashi Vaid was at the podium when Petrelis stood from his seat at the back of the room and shouted, \\"You've sold out the gay community!\\" Petrelis accused the community leaders of being \\"really out of touch\\" with the gay community's frustration and anger. \\"After six years there has been no action. And you guys are coming in here and acting as though what happened today is something to be applauded.\\" On April 30, 1987, Petrelis and Robinson were at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. to disrupt an appearance by William Bennet, then Secretary of Education in the Ronald Reagan administration. In a speech, approved by the White House and given to a group of students on the last day of classes, Bennet advocated mandatory AIDS testing for people convicted of crimes, people admitted to hospitals or seeking care at clinics, \\"perhaps particularly those serving high-risk populations,\\" people applying to settle in the United States, and couples applying to marry. Petrelis and Robinson distributed leaflets saying, \\"No condoms, no sex, no privacy, no freedom, no choice, no reality, & no cure.\\" When Bennett invited questions from the audience, Petrelis and Robinson stood, unfurled a purple banner that said \\"Lavender Hill Mob,\\" and shouted, \\"Test drugs, not people. We're dying. We're dying.\\" Petrelis screamed, \\"I have AIDS, but it's taken President Reagan six years to say the word AIDS.\\" Campus security officers removed Petrelis and Robinson from the room, and detained them for half an hour before releasing them. The AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) Upon his return from the CDC protest in Atlanta, Petrelis received a call from playwright Larry Kramer, asking to meet. Having read the news of the Lavender Hill Mob's actions at the CDC, Kramer wanted to discuss such confrontational tactics as ringing the White House with protesters, disrupting congress, and shutting down Wall Street. Kramer told Petrelis he was giving a speech at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center on the upcoming Tuesday night, as a last-minute substitute for the scheduled speaker, writer Nora Ephron. Kramer urged Petrelis to invite everyone he knew. On March 10, 1987, Petrelis was among approximately seventy- five people at the community center when Kramer gave the speech that marked the foundation of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP). In his speech, Kramer cited the attention achieved by the Lavender Hill Mob at the CDC in Atlanta, crediting the group's \\"blissfully rude\\" protest. After the speech, Petrelis stood and suggested they organize a public demonstration in New York City. \\"We need people,\\" he shouted. \\"We have all got to get arrested.' When ACT UP staged its first demonstration two weeks later, two hundred and fifty people descended on Wall Street to protest the relationship between the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Burroughs Wellcome, the maker of AZT, charging the pharmaceutical manufacturer with profiteering. They hung an effigy of FDA Commissioner Frank Young in front of Trinity Church and tied up traffic for hours. Petrelis was one of seventeen demonstrators arrested for acts of civil disobedience. In October 1988, Petrelis traveled to Portland, Oregon, where he organized a local chapter of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power: ACT UP/Portland. There, he was arrested with three others protesting the airing of a television drama by NBC affiliate KGW-TV that depicted violence against a character with AIDS, helped block traffic on Burnside Bridge to protest passage of Ballot Measure 8, quarreled with state health officials who demanded the return of five thousand state-supplied condoms after they discovered ACT UP meant to distribute the condoms outside a high school, criticized a state-sponsored series of AIDS awareness advertisements for not using the word \\"gay\\", and was arrested with ten others outside the Portland office of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) protesting the agency's failure to release four promising new drugs. Petrelis returned to New York City a year later, where he was one of 111 protesters arrested at the Stop the Church demonstration at St. Patrick's Cathedral on December 11, 1989. The demonstration was among ACT Up's most controversial, but Petrelis almost didn't participate; none of the other activists wanted to include him in their affinity groups for that demonstration because, he recalled, \\"People felt I was too angry.\\" Petrelis said he nonetheless felt driven to go and changed his mind. Arriving early before the police had established barricades, Petrelis was able to enter the church, and sit on the aisle in the middle of the cathedral. As other protesters stage silent die-ins, or calmly read prepared statements, Petrelis stood on the pew and screamed, \\"O'Connor, you're killing us! You're killing us, just stop it! Just stop it!\\" Before officers removed him from the cathedral, Petrelis screamed, \\"We will not be silent. We will fight O'Connor's bigotry.\\" Petrelis later faced criticism for his actions inside the cathedral. By standing on a pew, blowing a whistle, and screaming, while the other protesters inside the church participated in silent die-ins or read prepared statements, Petrelis had angered other protesters as well as outsiders and established his early reputation as one of ACT UP's more radical members. Years in Washington, D.C. In January 1990, Petrelis moved to Washington, D.C. to \\"wreak havoc on what he saw as a complacent lesbian and gay community.\\" Years later, Petrelis recalled a confrontation with Kramer at an ACT UP meeting in New York as prompting the move.\\"Your obnoxiousness is not appreciated here,\\" he remembered Kramer shouting. \\"Why don't you move to Washington, where your anger is more necessary?\\" There, Petrelis helped organize a local chapter of ACT UP, which began meeting in March 1990. With ACT UP/DC, Petrelis protested censorship of homoeroticism in the arts, pressured Amnesty International to recognize people imprisoned for sodomy to be counted as victims of human rights abuse, demanded an end to the United States' immigration restrictions against people with HIV, traveled to President George H. W.Bush's family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, to disrupt the president's vacation, disrupted the National Conference of Catholic Bishops' press conference to protest Roman Catholic Church teachings on condom use, helped stuff condoms and AIDS awareness posters into hundreds of vending box copies of the Washington Post to criticize the newspaper's AIDS coverage, helped organize large demonstrations at the United States Capitol, and launched a nationwide boycott of the Philip Morris Co. (now Altria Group, Inc.), to protest the company's support for Jesse Helms, a Republican senator from North Carolina. In June 1991, angered by what he considered unfair treatment of Greg Greeley, a captain in the United States Air Force, after Greeley marched in Washington D.C.'s gay pride parade on the last day of his commission, Petrelis helped organize Queer Nation/National Capital, a Washington, D.C. chapter of the militant direct action group. Petrelis used Queer Nation as a platform for outing closeted politicians and seeking justice for Allen R. Schindler, Jr., a sailor beaten to death in Japan because he was gay. =Philip Morris boycott= On April 20, 1990, Petrelis and other members of ACT UP/DC met with executives of the Philip Morris Co., makers of Marlboro cigarettes, to discuss the company's support for Jesse Helms, a Republican Senator from North Carolina. The activists told the executives that Helms' voting record on issues important to lesbian, gay men, and people with AIDS was entirely negative: he had \\"voted wrong every time.\\" They left the meeting \\"agreeing to disagree.\\" On the following Monday, Petrelis announced a nationwide boycott of Marlboro cigarettes. ACT UP/DC published a position paper explaining the reasons for the boycott. In June, ACT UP/ San Francisco announced an expansion of the boycott to include Miller beer, also manufactured by Philip Morris. The boycott drew support from advocates of the arts, unhappy with Helms' efforts to defund the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). At the boycott's peak, ACT UP was conducting related activities in eighteen cities, with a toll-free boycotters' hotline and a rumor control team. At an August 13, 1990, press conference on the steps of the Philip Morris headquarters in midtown Manhattan, representatives of ACT UP/NY said the Miller beer boycott was being observed in more than thirty cities across the U.S. and in more than one hundred bars, clubs, restaurants, and theaters in New York City. As the boycott expanded, Petrelis targeted Helms in other ways. On July 17, 1990, he was arrested with five other members of ACT UP/DC in Helms' office in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, after the demonstrators \\"shouted and chanted\\" and threatened to occupy the office until Helms resigned. A month later, the \\"Helms Office Six\\" pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charge of protesting in a capitol building; in exchange for their plea, prosecutors dropped the more serious misdemeanor charge of unlawful entry that carried a penalty of up to one year in jail. The court sentenced the protesters to three days in jail, suspended, and six months probation. On August 14, 1990, Petrelis defended an ACT UP/DC poster campaign featuring an image of Helms sodomizing George H. W. Bush. ACT UP members wheat-pasted the poster in neighborhoods throughout the District of Columbia. In August, the Conservative Campaign Fund of Washington, D.C. filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) naming Petrelis, ACT UP/DC, and other boycott organizers. The complaint charged the boycott organizers with interfering with the North Carolina Senate race in violation of federal election rules. In February 1991, the FEC announced it would pursue the case, and in 1993, the FEC pressured ACT UP to enter into a conciliation process to negotiate the civil fine the organization would pay. ACT UP determined to keep fighting. Citing the length of time that had passed and the fact that the ACT UP chapters named in the complaint no longer existed, FEC general council Larry Noble eventually recommended the commissioners drop the case. That fall, Petrelis and other ACT UP members heckled Philip Morris Co. executives in some cities as they traveled the country with Virginia's original copy of the Bill of Rights, a Philip Morris sponsored tour celebrating the founding document's upcoming bicentennial. Petrelis credited this \\"public relations nightmare\\" with the company's willingness the following summer to settle the boycott. On May 31, 1991, the Philip Morris Co. and ACT UP held a joint press conference announcing an end to the boycott, with the cigarette and beer maker condemning anti-gay discrimination, and promising to double its contributions to AIDS causes and create a new program to channel contributions to lesbian and gay groups. The company also specified that its campaign contributions to Helms were based on Helms' support of the tobacco industry alone and did not reflect agreement with his other positions. Petrelis called on gay and lesbian groups to accept the settlement. He said the boycott had sensitized the company about AIDS and anti-homosexual attitudes. The settlement, and Petrelis' role in the negotiations that led to it were controversial within ACT UP. Bill Haskell of ACT UP/San Francisco vowed the boycott would continue. William Dobbs of ACT UP/New York called the settlement \\"despicable,\\" and equated accepting money from the company with \\"stepping over thousands of dead\\" to fight AIDS. =Outing campaigns= On May 26, 1990, Petrelis held a press conference with Carl Goodman on the west steps of the United States Capitol to read the names of eleven officials, including eight members of congress and one entertainment executive who, the activists claimed, were secretly homosexual. A number of reporters attended the press conference, and some wrote about it, but none published the names. Petrelis would later recall he had been \\"emboldened\\" to organize the press conference by an article in the San Francisco Examiner which attributed the prediction of a \\"national outing day\\" to writer Arthur Evans. One of the individuals Petrelis and Goodman named was Mark Hatfield, a Republican Senator from Oregon whom Petrelis had first helped expose as secretly homosexual in February 1989, part of the first political outing of an elected official by American activists. In the aftermath of the outing of newly deceased multimillionaire Malcolm Forbes by the lesbian and gay news magazine, OutWeek, Petrelis said of the tactic, \\"Outing is a very complicated issue. There are no rules for outing. Politicians give up a lot of their privacy. Their lives are lived in a fishbowl.\\" Steve Gunderson, a Republican representing Wisconsin's 3rd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives, had been among those individuals Petrelis had included on his list of closeted homosexuals at the May 26, 1990, press conference on the steps of the United States Capitol. When Petrelis encountered Gunderson at a gay bar in Alexandria, Virginia, in late June, 1991, Petrelis confronted Gunderson, urging him to come out and support gay rights. Specifically, Petrelis objected to Gunderson's vote against the Civil Rights Amendment Act of 1991, which would have extended the protections of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include sexual orientation. Gunderson reportedly replied, \\"I am out. I'm in this bar aren't I?\\", dismissing Petrelis. Petrelis grew angry and threw a beverage at his face. Petrelis then called the police on himself. Afterwards, Petrelis contacted journalists to promote the incident. After Petrelis and others made Gunderson's homosexuality public, Gunderson became more supportive of gay issues and more open about his own sexuality. On June 28, 1991, Petrelis held a press conference attended by the Associated Press, Tribune Broadcasting, The Washington Post, and a local NBC affiliate to out Pete Williams, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. Williams had risen to prominence during the Gulf War, acting as a Pentagon spokesperson. His homosexuality was considered an open secret in some Washington circles. Petrelis' press release stated, \\"Pete Williams, an openly closeted gay man, hypocritically remains silent in his job as Pentagon spokesman, while the Department of Defense continues its irrational policy of ejecting thousands of gays and lesbians from the armed services.\\" At the press conference, Petrelis unfurled a poster bearing an image of Williams that read: PETE WILLIAMS ABSOLUTELY QUEER: PENTAGON SPOKESPERSON, TAP DANCER, CONSUMMATE QUEER. No one reported the story, but Petrelis returned to the Pentagon on August 6, 1991, to intercept reporters as they entered the building for a regularly scheduled Tuesday morning briefing. Petrelis held an impromptu press conference. He carried with him a box of copies of an article by Michelangelo Signorile from the most recent issue of the Advocate, outing Williams. Petrelis scolded the reporters for ignoring the story and urged them to ask Williams directly about his homosexuality. A half hour into Williams' briefing that day, Rolf Paasch, a foreign correspondent with Berlin's Die Tageszeitung, asked Williams if he could confirm or deny the claims that he was gay, and whether or not he had discussed possible resignation with Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. Williams responded by saying he was not paid to discuss his personal life and that \\"government people don't discuss in public whatever they may say to their bosses.\\" =ACT UP Presidential Project= Petrelis temporarily relocated to a rented apartment in Manchester, New Hampshire at the beginning of December 1991, to organize what later became known as the ACT UP Presidential Project. The aim of the project was to pressure presidential candidates of all parties to address AIDS and other issues important to lesbian and gay voters. Petrelis launched the effort in Concord, New Hampshire on December 10, 1991, when he disrupted conservative commentator Pat Buchanan's announcement of his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination. Two minutes into Buchanan's speech, broadcast on the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network (C-SPAN), Petrelis started screaming, \\"Act up, fight back, fight AIDS!\\" Off camera, senior Buchanan campaign officials tackled Petrelis and dragged him from the hall, while Buchanan advised, \\"Be gentle. Be gentle with him.\\" Standing over Petrelis outside, the campaign officials were heard to threaten, \\"Every time you come here, this is what you're going to get. Tell your friends.\\" Petrelis filed an assault complaint with the New Hampshire State Police against the two campaign officials, Paul Nagy and Chris Tremblay. Over the coming months, Petrelis led a small group of activists around the country, following the candidates to key primary states and successfully inserting the project's issues into the national debate. The project distributed condoms at campaign venues and offices, produced a thirty-second television ad, accusing the candidates of ignoring AIDS, that sparked controversy when WMUR-TV in Manchester, New Hampshire, refused to air it because the station objected to the images of same-sex couples kissing, challenged presidential hopeful Ross Perot's promise that his administration would not appoint homosexuals to cabinet posts, and encouraged lesbian and gay voters to be skeptical about then-candidate Bill Clinton. The pressure on Clinton resulted in sixteen AIDS- specific policy promises from the campaign. Ann Northrop, a New York City activist and journalist, later said of Petrelis' efforts, \\"Michael did a great job putting our issues on the agenda during the campaign.\\" =Seeking justice for Allen Schindler= On December 17, 1992, Petrelis noticed a short item in the Washington Times about the October 27, 1992, beating death, in Sasebo, Japan, of Allen R. Schindler, Jr., a United States Navy seaman stationed aboard the , who the newspaper said may have been gay. When Petrelis could find no other information, he said he grew suspicious. He believed the gay sailor's death was a consequence of the military's ban on homosexuals that Clinton had promised to repeal. He telephoned Schindler's mother, Dorothy Hajdys, and told her his intentions to raise awareness about the crime for political reasons. Petrelis vowed to turn Schindler into \\"the gay Rodney King.\\" He organized a press conference and protest on the steps of the Pentagon that prompted coverage on local television stations that night. Activists claimed the protest also prompted the Navy to disclose previously concealed details of the crime. Petrelis believed the Navy was downplaying Schindler's homosexuality. Hajdys complained that the Navy did not inform her until December 6, 1992, that her son had openly identified himself as homosexual a month before the murder. Over the next six months, Petrelis organized numerous press conferences at the Pentagon, the White House, and in Japan. Hajdys said that, without the public attention, \\"the Navy would whitewash the whole thing.\\". She feared the Navy was trying to cover up a hate crime. On January 18, 1993, Petrelis organized a candlelight vigil for Schindler, sponsored by Queer Nation/National Capital, at the United States Navy Memorial, with Hajdys participating. At a hearing on February 3, 1993, the Navy charged Airman Apprentice Terry M. Helvey of the USS Belleau Wood with Schndler's murder, based largely on the accounts of his shipmate and accomplice, Charles E. Vins, whom the Navy had tried quietly in November and sentenced to only four months in prison in exchange for his testimony. Petrelis did not trust the Navy to fully prosecute Helvey. At the White House, Petrelis met with Bob Hattoy, the Clinton administration's liaison to the gay community, to discuss the Schindler case and ask for a special prosecutor. With the financial support of David Geffen, Charles Holmes, Larry Kramer, and Marvin Liebman, among others, Petrelis traveled twice to Japan to monitor the proceedings. There, he held press conferences, met with sailors who had been stationed with Schindler on the USS Belleau Wood, gained access to the U.S. naval base at Sasebo, Japan, where the USS Belleau Wood was docked, and obtained special permission to attend Helvey's court-martial proceedings at the U.S. naval base at Yokosuka, Japan. To avoid the death penalty for premeditated murder, Helvey pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of \\"murder with intent to do great bodily harm.\\" On May 28, 1993, the Navy sentenced him to life in prison. Petrelis said, \\"This sentence sends a message that it's not O.K. to kill gay sailors and that homophobic violence will be punished.\\" Return to San Francisco In 1995, Petrelis left Washington, DC, to return to San Francisco, California. There, he continued to speak out and take action on a wide range of issues: advocating rent control, protesting internet censorship, criticizing how the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conducted and publicized a study on the use of nonoxynol-9 among men who have sex with men, questioning the role of heterosexuals as leaders of lesbian and gay organizations, opposing the death penalty, even in cases of fatal hate crimes, criticizing Willie Brown, Mayor of San Francisco, for using a pejorative, \\"pantywaists,\\" to insult United Airlines' airplanes, and supporting state- mandated name reporting for people with HIV. Petrelis was also credited as the architect of a campaign to out Jim Kolbe, a Republican congressman from Arizona, after Kolbe voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). =Female condoms for gay men= In early 1996, the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) agreed to offer female condoms to men who have sex with men, as protection against HIV and other sexually transmitted infections during anal sex, after Petrelis urged them to do so by phone and letter. Petrelis criticized the agency for failing to hold public meetings about the female condom, and initially failing to provide adequate instructions for its use. Petrelis also worried that use of the female condom for anal sex had not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Because Petrelis had first lobbied for wider distribution of the female condom, then criticized how SFDPH accomplished that, an unnamed SFDPH staff member accused Petrelis of \\"a complete 180 back flip.\\" Petrelis countered that he had consistently advocated for SFDPH to hold public hearings about its work. =Campaign to reopen the bathhouses= In 1997, Petrelis helped organize a campaign to reopen the bathhouses, after San Francisco Board of Supervisors member Tom Ammiano proposed an ordinance to license and regulate the city's sex clubs, thereby codifying previously voluntary guidelines. Petrelis opposed the measure as an unwarranted government intrusion into the sex lives of gay men. Among the voluntary guidelines to be codified by the legislation was a prohibition against locked doors, behind which patrons might engage in unprotected anal intercourse. San Francisco health officials considered the availability of such private spaces to be a distinguishing characteristic of the bathhouses the city had worked to close, and keep closed, since 1984. The debate over the proposed legislation led some activists to demand reopening the bathhouses. Petrelis said, \\"...I think that there are mature gay men who know how to make decisions behind closed doors.\\" Ammiano's proposal failed for lack of support from San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown. For the next two years, Petrelis and other activists lobbied SFDPH to reverse the prohibition against bathhouses with locking doors. In 1999, the activists authored a ballot initiative to overturn the ban on private rooms in gay sex clubs and eliminate the requirement that club staff monitor consensual behavior among club patrons. Mitchell Katz, director of SFDPH, strongly opposed the initiative before it even qualified for the ballot; the San Francisco Chronicle editorialized against it, citing \\"disturbing evidence of an upsurge in dangerous sex practices among some gays.\\" Petrelis responded by demanding that critics reveal the evidence they claimed, while citing statistics showing decreased incidence of both male rectal gonorrhea and new AIDS cases in San Francisco. Activists collected only four thousand signatures of the more than ten thousand needed to qualify the measure for the ballot in November 1999. =AIDS Accountability Project= In 1997, Petrelis and other activists grew critical of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation (SFAF), a nonprofit AIDS service organization (ASO), and its executive director, Pat Christen. Petrelis said people with AIDS were going without needed assistance because SFAF was spending \\"too much on itself\\" and demanded that SFAF disclose the salaries of its executives. He encouraged activists in other cities to ask similar questions about how AIDS dollars were being spent where they live. When SFAF's informational tax return, or Form 990, revealed that Christen was paid more than $162,000 in 1995, Petrelis and other activists were infuriated. The activists' complaints about the lack of transparency at SFAF led Tom Ammiano, representing District 9 on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, to propose a controversial disclosure law requiring a charity that receives city funds to open all its meetings to the public, make all its documents available to the public, and admit a city-appointed observer to its board of directors if deemed necessary by the Board of Supervisors. In June 1998, Willie Brown, Mayor of San Francisco, signed a compromise version of the ordinance, requiring charities that receive at least $250,000 in city grants to convene at least two public board meetings a year and provide some financial information to the public. In 1998, Petrelis organized the AIDS Accountability Project, and created a web site to publish the informational tax returns of nonprofit ASO's. By April, the project had published the tax returns of twenty-eight such agencies located throughout the United States and highlighted the six-digit salaries of certain ASO executives. After Petrelis expressed his concerns to Tom Coburn, a Republican representing Oklahoma's 2nd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives, Coburn made a floor speech accusing AIDS charity executives of \\"lining their own pockets.\\" Coburn read into the Congressional Record an article from the San Francisco Examiner about Petrelis and the AIDS Accountability Project. AIDS groups criticized Petrelis for working with Coburn, a supporter of mandatory names reporting for people with HIV and AIDS. Petrelis responded that he had first expressed his concerns to Barbara Boxer, a Democrat representing California in the United States Senate, and Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat representing California's 12th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. Boxer and Pelosi did not take an interest in Petrelis' cause. Petrelis asked, \\"...but where are the liberals?\\" In December 1998, the Family Research Council called on the 106th Congress to conduct a \\"full audit of all federal AIDS dollars\\" before reauthorizing the Ryan White Care Act, the legislation through which AIDS dollars were appropriated; Petrelis lamented, \\"What has the world come to when strident AIDS activists find their calls for accountability from AIDS charities are echoed by the Family Research Council?\\" In April 1999, Coburn formally requested that the Government Accounting Office (GAO) conduct a performance audit and evaluation of all federal HIV programs and services. Joining him in the request were House Majority Leader Dick Armey, a Republican representing Texas' 26th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives, and Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley, a Republican representing Virginia's 7th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. The GAO published the requested report in March 2000, concluding that federal AIDS programs were administered well and were effective, portending the reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE ACT. The report said that compensation for the executives of nonprofit ASO's receiving federal assistance was \\"generally comparable to that of similar nonprofit organizations.\\" Based on the report, Coburn concluded that more federal funding needed to be directed towards prevention efforts. Months later, a San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) report showing increased HIV transmission rates in San Francisco led Petrelis to question how local organizations were using the more than sixteen million dollars being spent annually for HIV prevention efforts. He also publicly accused two local HIV prevention professionals of hypocrisy for advocating condom use while posting personal profiles on a website for men seeking unprotected sex with other men. Petrelis demanded greater accountability at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as well; he believed federal funds budgeted for HIV prevention should only be spent on the prevention programs themselves and not to reimburse prevention professionals for travel and lodging related to attending conferences. Petrelis said such expenditures exemplified the \\"AIDS gravy train.\\" In April 2001, he credited Paul Kawata, executive director of the National Minority AIDS Council (NMAC), for postponing indefinitely a Minority Executives Retreat originally planned to take place in Oahu, Hawaii. In 2001, Petrelis contacted Mark Souder, a Republican representing Indiana's 3rd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives and chairing the subcommittee of the House Committee on Government Oversight and Reform that oversaw public health programs, and complained about the ineffectiveness and sexually explicit nature of federally funded HIV prevention programs being administered by the Stop AIDS Project in San Francisco. Petrelis said he had tried first to pressure both the SFDPH and the CDC to scrutinize the programs, without results. Souder requested that Janet Rhenquist, Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services conduct an investigation into the programs. In a report released October 12, 2001, Rhenquist concluded the programs could be construed as directly encouraging sexual activity and as obscene, both violations of the guidelines for such programs receiving federal funds. As a result of the findings, Rhenquist said she would expand her investigation into all CDC- funded AIDS-prevention programs. The AIDS Accountability Project also questioned the activities of the Elton John AIDS Foundation after the foundation refused to release its informational tax returns (IRS Forms 990). Petrelis said that of the sixty organizations from which the project had requested the returns, only the Elton John AIDS Foundation had refused to release the information. =Criminal charges and arrest= Following an October 23, 2000, demonstration in the client service area of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation (SFAF) offices, the San Francisco County Superior Court named Petrelis, David Pasquarelli of ACT UP/ San Francisco, and four others in an injunction against ACT UP/San Francisco, barring the activists from within one hundred feet of five SFAF employees and their workplace for three years. Petrelis was not a member of ACT UP/San Francisco. On November 12, 2001, a temporary restraining order barred Petrelis and Paquarelli from contacting or coming within three hundred feet of any employees of the San Francisco Chronicle or the newspaper's offices. The order alleged that Petrelis and Pasquarelli made dozens of obscene and threatening calls to editors and reporters at home and at work. The newspaper's lawyers said the activists appeared to be angry about two stories published in the newspaper, one about an increase in unsafe sex practices among gay men in San Francisco, another about SFDPH statistics showing rising rates of syphilis among gay men in San Francisco. On November 28, 2001, Petrelis and Pasquarelli appeared before the San Francisco County Superior Court for a hearing on civil harassment suits by two public health officials, and five San Francisco Chronicle editors and reporters who claimed they received threatening phone calls. In the courthouse hallway after the hearing, San Francisco Police Department officers arrested Petrelis and Pasquarelli. The activists were charged with criminal conspiracy, stalking, and making terrorist threats against newspaper reporters and public health officials. Petrelis' bail was set at $500,000; Pasquarelli's bail was set at $600,000. On November 30, 2001, a judge refused the arrestees' request for a reduction in the unusually high bail. Mark Vermeulen, the attorney representing Petrelis and Pasquarelli, said the activists were abiding by the restraining orders, the matter was being handled by the civil courts, and that there was no need for criminal prosecution. The twenty-seven counts of criminal conspiracy, stalking, and making terrorist threats carried a possible penalty of up to seventy-eight years in prison. Petrelis and Pasquarelli admitted they made late-night phone calls but denied making threats. They said they had been angered by an article reporting what they believed to be concocted SFDPH statistics showing rising rates of syphilis among gay men in San Francisco. The activists also admitted making similar phone calls to Jeffrey Klausner, the public health official from whose office at SFDPH the syphilis statistics had originated and one of the complainants in the criminal proceedings. Klausner had also angered the activists by speculating in a Washington Monthly magazine article about possibly quarantining HIV-positive men who refused to practice protected sex. Klausner said his remarks were taken out of context. The author of the article wrote a clarification denying that Klausner or the SFDPH advocated such an approach. Hundreds of people, including AIDS activists and cultural icons, signed an open letter written by William K. Dobbs, a New York-based activist and civil liberties lawyer, demanding bail reduction and opposing the severe charges, although some activists said Petrelis and Pasquarelli belonged in jail. A researcher at the University of California at San Francisco requested the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigate Petrelis and Pasquarelli under the domestic terrorism provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. The FBI declined to pursue the request. While in custody, Petrelis complained of inadequate medical attention. He suffered from an esophageal candidiasis infection (thrush) and a serious skin condition affecting sixty percent of his body. On December 8, 2001, a judge ordered Petrelis rushed to the prison medical unit for treatment. In February 2002, Judge Perker Meeks of the San Francisco County Superior Court said he found sufficient evidence that Petrelis and Pasquarelli had made threats intended to cause fear and ordered the activists to stand trial. Petrelis and Pasquarelli had spent seventy-three days in jail when their supporters posted a reduced, combined bail of $220,000, and the activists were released to await trial. Nearly a year and a half later, the activists pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges of making threatening phone calls to public health officials and reporters at the San Francisco Chronicle. The court sentenced Petrelis and Pasquarelli to one year in jail, suspended to three years probation, and ordered the activists to attend anger management training, stay away from the officials and reporters for three years, and issue written apologies to their victims. Under the agreement, Petrelis was allowed to send the San Francisco Chronicle one letter or fax per day on matters of public interest. =Opposing Scott Wiener= In 2012, Petrelis opposed legislation to ban public nudity proposed by Scott Wiener, a Democrat representing District 8 on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Petrelis also clashed with Wiener over other issues. In November 2012, Petrelis was arrested for taking a photograph of Wiener in a public restroom in San Francisco City Hall without Wiener's permission. Petrelis pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge and received three years probation. The judge also issued a complicated stay-away order restricting Petrelis from being within one hundred and fifty feet of Wiener, as well as other provisions, including exceptions that permit Petrelis to attend certain public meetings. In March 2013, Petrelis announced his candidacy for the District 8 supervisor seat currently held by Wiener. Petrelis said he was running to give voters a way to \\"protest against Castro gentrification and development greed.\\" References External links * Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Writers from Newark, New Jersey Category:HIV/AIDS activists Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:People from San Francisco Category:Activists from California ","title":"Michael Petrelis"},{"id":"42366947","text":"Baudoinia is a fungal genus in the family Teratosphaeriaceae.

Top row from left: Thora Daugaard (Denmark), Louise Qvam (Norway), Aletta Jacobs (Netherlands), Annie Furuhjelm (Finland), Madame Mirowitch (Russia), K√§the Schirmacher (Germany), Madame Honneger, unidentified. Bottom left: Unidentified, Anna Bugge (Sweden), Anna Howard Shaw (USA), Millicent Fawcett (Presiding, England), Carrie Chapman Catt (USA), F. M. Qvam (Norway), Anita Augspurg (Germany). Annie Fredrika Furuhjelm (11 December 1859 ‚Äì 17 July 1937) was a Finnish journalist, feminist activist, and writer. She was a member of the Parliament of Finland from 1913 to 1924 and again from 1927 to 1929, representing the Swedish People's Party of Finland (SFP). She was the first enfranchised woman in Europe to serve as a delegate to the International Women Suffrage Alliance and the first elected female legislator to speak before the British Parliament. She was awarded the Order of the White Rose of Finland for her service to the nation. Early life Annie Fredrika Furuhjelm was born on 11 December 1859 at Rekoor Castle in Sitka on Baranof Island in the Russian Colony of Alaska. Her father, Johan Hampus Furuhjelm, was the penultimate Russian governor of Alaska and her mother Anna von Schoultz was the daughter of a Swedish-Finnish adventurer. When Alaska was purchased by the United States, the family left in 1867 for Russian Siberia, where they spent six years in Nikolayevsk-on-Amur before returning to Helsinki. In 1870, Furujhelm was sent to Dresden for schooling before rejoining her family in Helsinki in 1872. She was highly educated and fluently spoke English, French, German, Italian, Russian and Swedish, having completed studies at the girl's gymnasium in 1876 and post-graduate college in 1887. Career After completing her schooling, Furuhjelm lived on her family's estate and founded a school. She worked as a nurse for many years in the local community, but grew tired of the isolation and decided to become a journalist in 1890. She founded a newspaper called New Tide (), which would become the mouthpiece of the Finnish women's organization. In 1899, Furuhjelm met with other likeminded women, including Lucina Hagman, , and Sofia Rein, to help Hagman organize the Martha organisation, a humanitarian organization to help women manage their homes. Since assembly was banned at that time by the Finnish government, the women met clandestinely in different members homes. Furuhjelm served as the first secretary of the organization. In 1904, Furuhjelm attended the 5th congress of the International Council of Women (ICW) in Berlin and asked for help from the organization to found a Finnish suffrage organization. The ICW refused as Finland was still ruled by the Russian Empire, but Carrie Chapman Catt gave reassurances that the International Women Suffrage Alliance (IWSA) would support a Finnish suffrage organization. Furuhjelm returned from the conference energized and organized a conference which was attended by 1,000 women. The following year, she established the Committee for Women's Suffrage. Following the general strike, Finland re-gained its autonomy from Russia which de facto had been under dispute since 1899. Universal suffrage was granted to all Finnish citizens in 1906. When Finland's suffrage organization was approved for alliance with the IWSA in 1906, Furuhjelm became the first fully enfranchised European delegate of the association. Between 1909 and 1920, she was a board member of the IWSA and attended congresses of the organization from Finland's admittance in 1906 until 1929. She was the keynote speaker of the 1906 Copenhagen conference of the IWSA and was given a standing ovation for her speech. The Swedish Women's Association of Finland was founded in 1907 with Furuhjelm elected to the presidency. She would maintain that position for her lifetime. She became a regular speaker at international suffrage meetings; a contributor to Jus Suffragii, the official journal of the IWSA; and a personal friend and companion to Catt. In 1913, Furuhjelm was elected to the Parliament of Finland, one of the first twenty-one females elected,. In the following year, she accompanied Catt when she spoke to the British Parliament in London; this was the first time an elected woman legislator had addressed the Parliament. In 1917, she served as part of the Law Committee which briefly reestablished the Finnish Monarchy and issued the Finnish Declaration of Independence, which ultimately led to the Finnish Republic. In 1919, she began working as an editor of the journal Astra and would continue in that capacity until 1927. Furuhjelm served in the Diet until she was defeated in 1924 despite her campaign to end Finland's Prohibition Law. She was reelected to serve in 1927 as a representative of the Swedish People's Party of Finland (SFP). When Furuhjelm retired from politics in 1929, she was awarded the Order of the White Rose of Finland. In her last years, Furuhjelm dedicated her time to women's rights organizations. She continued to push for the repeal of prohibition believing that the law was creating an upsurge in crime and smuggling and was not controlling the consumption of alcohol. She also published two volumes of memoirs, shortly before her death on 17 July 1937.

Having led many strikes and uprisings against Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang government, he became one of the most wanted CPC members by the Kuomintang. He was captured and executed in 1933. Biography Born in October 1894 in Yizhang, Hunan, Deng was a philosophy graduate of Peking University. He joined the May 4th Movement in 1919 and initiated the Marxist Research Group in the university. In 1920, that group set up a communist organization in which Li Dazhao was elected as the party secretary and of which Deng became a member. Inspired by the communism, Deng became involved in the labor movement in Beijing during the same year. He set up the workers‚Äô unions and provided education to the workers. In 1922, he was elected as the director of a nationwide labor organization at the First Chinese Labor Meeting held in Guangzhou. In July of the same year, he was elected as the member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China at the Second Party Congress. In 1923, under Li‚Äôs recommendation, he received an administrative job from Shanghai University, which was co-founded by the CPC and the Kuomintang during their short-term cooperation. During Deng‚Äôs tenure, he invited a number of communists, including Cai Hesen, Qu Qiubai and Li Da, to teach at the school. In 1925, after the establishment of the All- China Federation of Labor, Deng was designated as the publicity minister in Guangzhou and organized the Canton-Hong Kong strike, which lasted from June 1925 to October 1926. When the Kuomintang and the CPC split, Deng proposed an uprising in Nanchang, Jiangxi, to fight against Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai- shek‚Äôs massacre of CPC members. In the CPC‚Äôs critical August 7 Meeting in 1927, Deng was a supporter of land revolution and armed struggle. He was also elected as an alternate member of the provisional Political Bureau of the Central Committee of CPC. After the meeting, he was sent to Shanghai to organize the surviving party members. In 1928, he was appointed to Guangzhou and Hong Kong to rebuild destroyed CPC organizations. In 1930, he joined the armed struggle in Hunan and the Western Hubei Communist Base as the political commissar of the No. 2 Red Army with He Long and Zhou Yiqun. In 1932, he secretly returned to Shanghai to continue the underground struggle in the Kuomintang controlled economic hub. However, his identity was discovered, and he was arrested in Shanghai in May 1933. As Deng was an important CPC leader, his capture drew Chiang Kai-shek attention. Chiang ordered Deng sent to Nanjing‚Äôs prison camp and offered him a high position within the Kuomintang with good pay. But Deng refused the offer, and thus was severely tortured before being executed on September 21, 1933.

Pantano is a Ghost town located in eastern Pima County, Arizona, between Benson and Vail. Access is via the Marsh Station Road interchange on I-10.The Narrows, AZ, 7.5 Minute Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1996 It was originally a mail and stagecoach stop named Ci√©nega Station, after the nearby Ci√©nega Creek, and later grew into a small railroad town with the arrival of the Southern Pacific in 1880. History Ci√©nega Station was established by the Butterfield Overland Mail company in 1858. Built over the site of a Hohokam village, the station and later town went by many names over the years, including Pantano Station, Marsh Station, Tulleyville, and Empire. In the early days, hostile Apaches were a constant problem. The wife of Granville Henderson Oury described her journey through the area in 1861: \\"We are traveling through country which has always been infested by Indians, and very recently they have committed depredations and horrible atrocities on this very road. Our party is very small and there would be no escape for us if a party of Apaches were to attack us. We all realize this and are trusting to some good fortune or fate to get us through safely.\\" One morning in 1867, a pioneer named W. A. \\"Shotgun\\" Smith and three of his companions were attacked by Apaches at the station. All three of his friends were killed, but with his shotgun Smith managed to shoot down several of the hostiles and force the rest to withdraw at noon. According to Edward Vail, who owned the nearby Vail Ranch, the Pantano Cemetery is \\"filled with graves of men killed by Indians.\\" The Pantano railroad station and the town of Pantano were not established until 1880, when the Southern Pacific entered Pima County and began building along the south side of Ci√©nega Creek. The original townsite was chosen for its favorable location to build a depot and other railroad facilities. The location also attracted private businesses and settlers, who built several warehouses and homes, a small store with a blacksmith, and a carpenter's shop. Seventy-five people were living in Pantano in 1880, and in 1887 severe flooding forced them to relocate the town to the northern side of the creek. By 1905, the town's population had increased to 100, including a deputy sheriff, a justice of the peace, and six small businesses, including a general store and livery. Pantano reached its zenith in 1922, with a bank, a schoolhouse, a telegraph office, and a post office, all serving the town's 500 residents. Soon after, however, the Great Depression began and the town went into decline. Only forty people were left in 1941. The post office closed in 1952 and railroad operations ceased by 1956, leaving the town abandoned. In the 1960s, Southern Pacific leveled most of the buildings in town. The Pantano Townsite Conservation Area, which is located almost entirely within the Ci√©nega Creek Natural Preserve, was established in 2004 to protect the townsite and its cultural resources. As of today, all that remains in the ghost town are a few foundations, a water tower and pumphouse that was built by the railroad, and the cemetery. ;Jimmie Mercer On December 2, 1914, a Pima County Ranger named Jimmie Mercer and a local rancher named Robert Fenton were fired on by a Mexican cattle rustler named J. Padilla as the two were approaching the latter's ranch, north of Pantano. One bullet struck Mercer in the leg above the knee before the gunman fled into a nearby canyon and escaped. Mercer was taken back to Pantano and put on a train to Tucson, where he died about a week later on December 10, 1914. Today there is a small memorial for him near Pantano, at the entrance to the Ci√©nega Creek Natural Preserve. The Pete Kitchen Ranch, where Mercer spent a few years of his childhood, is also on display, and is located a few miles north of Nogales, Arizona.

George Warde Norman Early life He was born at Bromley Common, Kent, on 20 September 1793, the son of George Norman, a merchant in the Norway timber trade, and Charlotte, third daughter of Edward Beadon, rector of North Stoneham, Hampshire. He was educated at Eton College from 1805 to 1810, and then was in business with his father, spending time in 1819 to 1821 in Norway. His father retired in 1824, and he remained in the timber trade till 1830, when he transferred it to Sewell & Co., his brother Richard Norman becoming a partner in the new firm. Financial interests From 1821 to 1872 Norman was a director of the Bank of England, and in 1826 played a role in the establishment of its branch offices. About 1840 he was appointed a member of the committee of the treasury at the bank. During the commercial crisis of 1847 he spent much of his time at the bank, and conferred daily with Sir Charles Wood, Chancellor of the Exchequer, in Downing Street. In 1832 he was examined before Lord Althorp's committee of the House of Commons inquiry into currency, and in 1840 he gave evidence for six days before Sir Charles Wood's committee on matters connected with circulation. In 1848 he was examined before a committee of the House of Lords on currency matters. Norman became an exchequer bill commissioner in 1831; was renominated a commissioner in 1842, when the business was transferred to the public works loan commissioners, and served till 1876. He was also a director of the Sun Insurance Office from 1830 to 1864. Other interests Norman was for many years a governor of Guy's Hospital, and the last surviving original member of the Political Economy Club, founded in 1821. In politics he was a liberal, and an advocate of free trade; in 1835 he was asked to stand for election to Parliament for the City of London, and later to contest West Kent, but declined. He took an interest in matters connected with the Poor Law administration. Norman was also an English cricketer with amateur status who was active from 1827 to 1838. He made his first-class debut in 1832 and appeared in nine matches as an unknown handedness batsman whose bowling style is unknown, playing for Kent. He scored 81 runs with a highest score of 37* and took no wickets. Personal Soon after leaving Eton, Norman formed a close friendship with George Grote the historian. In 1814 Norman introduced Grote to Harriet Lewin, who later became Grote's wife; and it was at Norman's suggestion that Grote undertook to write the history of Greece rather than that of Rome, which he had originally intended. They had also a common interest in the development of cricket in West Kent. Death Norman died at Bromley Common, Kent, on 4 September 1882, within a few days of completing his eighty-ninth year. Works In 1833 Norman published Remarks upon some prevalent Errors with respect to Currency and Banking, and Suggestions to the Legislature as to the Renewal of the Bank Charter. An influential pamphlet, it was criticised by Samuel Jones Loyd, John Horsley Palmer, and Robert Torrens, and was republished in 1838. His other major work, was An Examination of some prevailing Opinions as to the Pressure of Taxation in this and other Countries (1850, 4th edition, 1864), in which he combated the view that the increase of public expenditure was a proof of heavier taxation. Other works were: *Letter to Charles Wood, esq., M.P., on Money, and the Means of economising the Use of it, 1841. *Remarks on the Incidence of Import Duties, with special reference to the England and Cuba Case contained in \\"The Budget\\", 1860. *Papers on various subjects, 1869. *The Future of the United States, a paper read before the British Association at Belfast in August 1874; printed in the Journal of the Statistical Society, March 1875. *A Memoir of the Rev.

Kuykendall was first elected to the Washington State Senate in November 1916. Elgin Victor Kuykendall (1870‚Äì1958) was an American lawyer, judge, and politician in the state of Washington in the United States. For several years the chairman of the state committee of the Republican Party of Washington, Kuykendall was first elected to the Washington State Senate in November 1916 and re-elected to a second term two years later. Kuykendall was appointed a judge of the Washington State Superior court in December 1924 and remained in that capacity until his retirement in December 1949. In his twilight years Kuykendall also pursued the avocation of regional historian, ultimately publishing two works on the history of Southeastern Washington state as well as his memoirs. Biography =Early years= Elgin Victor Kuykendall was born in Oakland, Oregon on October 8, 1870. His father, G.B. Kuykendall, was a prominent physician in the Southeastern Washington town of Pomeroy, Washington.W.D. Lyman, Lyman's History of Old Walla Walla County, Embracing Walla Walla, Columbia, Garfield and Asotin Counties. Chicago: S.J. Clarke Publishing Co., 1918; vol. 2, pp. 132‚Äì136. It was in that region of the state that Kuykendall grew up, attending the public schools of rural Garfield County. Following completion of his secondary education, Kuykendall briefly worked as a school teacher. He decided to pursue a career in jurisprudence in 1892, taking up the study of law under Pomeroy attorney Samuel G. Cosgrove, a man who would later become the sixth Governor of Washington. Kuykendall passed the Washington state bar exam in 1894 but did not immediately begin legal practice, instead running for election and winning the post of Superintendent of Schools in that same year. He would ultimately serve one term in that capacity. He also served for six months as principal of Pomeroy High School. Kuykendall married Marguerite Scully, the daughter of an Asotin County, Washington pioneer, in 1896. The couple would raise four children together. =Career= In 1897 Kuykendall left pedagogy behind and began his career in the legal profession, opening a private practice. He remained politically oriented, however, and in 1898 he ran for and won the post of County Prosecutor for Garfield County. The 28-year-old would again serve but one term in this second elected position before moving on. Kuykendall also maintained a private practice in addition to his prosecutorial role, ultimately joining into partnership with local judge Mack F. Gose to establish the firm Gose & Kuykendall in February 1898. In the next election, that of 1900, Kuykendall set his sights on the position of Mayor of the small town of Pomeroy. This third race was again met with success, and Kuykendall served yet another 2-year stint in office. All the while Kuykendall continued to build his legal practice, his relationship with Gose coming to an end only in 1909 when the latter was appointed to the Washington Supreme Court. Following Gose's appointment to the bench in Olympia, Kuykendall practiced law on his own for a two-year period before forming another partnership in 1911 as Kuykendall & McCabe. A staunch member of the Republican Party, Kuykendall served multiple terms as chairman of the Washington Republican State Committee during the decade of the 1910s. Kuykendall's finale electoral foray came in November 1916, when he was elected as a Republican member of the Washington State Senate. Unlike his previous electoral endeavors, Kuykendall would run for re- election in November 1918, continuing his undefeated record and gaining a second stint in the statehouse for the 1919 legislative session.\\"Guide to the Elgin Victor Kuykendall Papers 1892‚Äì1956,\\" Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections, Washington State University Libraries, 1975. In 1919 Washington Governor Louis F. Hart appointed Kuykendall to the Washington Public Service Commission.\\"Kuykendall Will Retire,\\" Walla Walla Union-Bulletin, November 10, 1949. He remained at that post for five years. On December 1, 1924 Chester M. Miller, Superior Court Judge for Asotin, Columbia, and Garfield Counties died and Kuykendall was appointed by Governor Hart as his successor. Kuykendall would remain in that position for the rest of his working life. =Fraternal affiliations= Kuykendall was an active member of the Methodist Church. He was also closely involved in the affairs of the Knights of Pythias as a member of the state's judiciary committee and was a member of the fraternal benefit society Woodmen of the World. =Later years= Kuykendall retired from the Superior Court bench on December 31, 1949, having served as a judge for 25 years. During his final years Kuykendall turned to the writing of his memoirs and to researching and publishing works of local history. Two of Kuykendall's books were published in 1954 with a third published only in 1984, more than a quarter century after his death.\\"Author: Elgin Victor Kuykendall,\\" OCLC WorldCat, www.worldcat.org/ =Death and legacy= Elgin V. Kuykendall died in Pomeroy, Washington on February 25, 1958. He was 87 years old at the time of his death. Elgin Kuykendall's papers are housed in the Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections section of Terrell Library at Washington State University in Pullman, Washington. The collection consists of approximately 8,000 documents and includes business documents, judicial papers, political speeches and historical writings, and correspondence.

Drache was laid down in February 1861, launched in September, and completed in November 1862. She remained in the Adriatic during the Second Schleswig War in 1864 while other ships were sent to attack Denmark. Two years later, Prussia and Italy attacked Austria in the Seven Weeks' War. The ship participated in the Austrian victory over the Italians in the Battle of Lissa, where she inflicted serious damage on the coastal defense ship , setting her on fire and ultimately destroying her. Drache was modernized immediately after the war, but saw little use thereafter. Badly rotted by 1875, she was stricken from the Navy List that year and eventually broken up in 1883. Design and description The Drache class was designed in response to the s bought from France by the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860.Silverstone, p. 17 They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of . They displaced at normal load, and at deep load. The ships had a horizontal steam engine that drove their single propeller using steam provided by four boilers that exhausted through one funnel. The engine produced a total of which gave the ships a speed of . For long-distance travel, the Draches were fitted with three masts and barque rigged. The ships had a complement of 346 officers and crewmen.Gardiner, p. 267 The frigates were armed with ten 48-pounder smoothbore guns and eighteen 24-pounder rifled, muzzle-loading (RML) guns in the traditional broadside arrangement of older ships of the line. In addition, they carried a pair of landing guns, one of which was an 8-pounder and the second was a 4-pounder. They were equipped with ram bows. The Drache-class ironclads had a waterline belt of wrought iron that was thick. Service history Drache was laid down at Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino at its Trieste shipyard on 18 February 1861, launched on 9 September 1861, and completed in November 1862. During the Second Schleswig War in 1864, Drache and her sister ship remained in the Adriatic to protect Austria's coastline, while a squadron was sent to the North Sea to attack Denmark.Greene & Massignani, p. 210 In June 1866, Italy declared war on Austria, as part of the Third Italian War of Independence, which was fought concurrently with the Austro-Prussian War.Sondhaus, p. 1 Rear Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, the commander of the Austrian Fleet, immediately began to mobilize his fleet. As the ships became fully manned, they began to conduct training exercises in Fasana.Wilson, p. 228 Tegetthoff brought the Austrian fleet to Ancona on 27 June, in an attempt to draw out the Italians, but the Italian commander, Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, refused to engage Tegetthoff.Wilson, pp. 216‚Äì218 =Battle of Lissa= Drache c. 1866 On 16 July, Persano took the Italian fleet out of Ancona and steamed to the island of Lissa, where they arrived on the 18th. With the main fleet of twelve ironclads, they brought troop transports carrying 3,000 soldiers. Persano then spent the next two days bombarding the Austrian defenses of the island and unsuccessfully attempting to force a landing.Wilson, pp. 221‚Äì224 Tegetthoff received a series of telegrams between the 17 and 19 July notifying him of the Italian attack, which he initially believed to be a feint to draw the Austrian fleet away from its main bases at Pola and Venice. By the morning of the 19th, however, he was convinced that Lissa was in fact the Italian objective, and so he requested permission to attack.Wilson, pp. 229‚Äì230 As Tegetthoff's fleet arrived off Lissa on the morning of 20 July, Persano's fleet was arrayed for another landing attempt. The latter's ships were divided into three groups, with only the first two able to concentrate in time to meet the Austrians.Wilson, pp. 223‚Äì225 Tegetthoff had arranged his ironclad ships into a wedge-shaped formation, with Drache on his right flank; the wooden warships of the second and third divisions followed behind in the same formation.Wilson, pp. 230‚Äì231 While he was forming up his ships, Persano transferred from his flagship, to the turret ship . This created a gap in the Italian line, and Tegetthoff seized the opportunity to divide the Italian fleet and create a melee. He made a pass through the gap, but failed to ram any of the Italian ships, forcing him to turn around and make another attempt.Wilson, pp. 232‚Äì235 Drache engaged the coastal defense ship with concentrated broadsides, including hot shot, which started a serious fire aboard Palestro. The latter attempted to withdraw, and was able to use her superior speed to escape from Drache. Left without her original target, Drache turned to fire at Re d'Italia along with several other Austrian vessels. One of them disabled the Italian ship's rudder, leaving her vulnerable to ramming. Tegetthoff steered his flagship at Re d'Italia and scored a clean hit with his ram, badly holing her below the waterline.Wilson, p. 235 During this period, Drache was hit several times; one shell struck her commander, Captain Moll Heinrich von Moll, in the head, killing him instantly. Lieutenant Karl Weyprecht took command of the ship for the remainder of the battle. A minor fire was also started, though the ship's crew quickly suppressed it. Another shell knocked down her mainmast.Wilson, p. 243Sokol, p. 45 Apart from this, the ship was not badly damaged in the engagement.Wilson, p. 245 After Re d'Italia sank, the Italian fleet began to disengage, with the badly burning Palestro trailing behind, soon to be destroyed by a magazine explosion. Persano broke off the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, he refused to counter-attack with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance so as not to risk his success. As night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively.Wilson, pp. 238‚Äì241, 250 =Later career= After returning to Pola, Tegetthoff kept his fleet in the northern Adriatic, where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack. The Italian ships never came, and on 12 August, the two countries signed the Armistice of Cormons; this ended the fighting and led to the Treaty of Vienna. Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the Battle of Custoza, the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz. As a result, Austria, which became Austria-Hungary in the Ausgleich of 1867, was forced to cede the city of Venice to Italy.Sondhaus, pp. 1‚Äì3 The two halves of the Dual Monarchy held veto power over the other, and Hungarian disinterest in naval expansion led to severely reduced budgets for the fleet. In the immediate aftermath of the war, the bulk of the Austrian fleet was decommissioned and disarmed.Sondhaus, p. 8 The fleet embarked on a modest modernization program after the war, primarily focused on re-arming the ironclads with new rifled guns. The budget for 1867 provided funds to modernize Drache and Salamander first, as they were the oldest ironclads in the fleet.Sondhaus, p. 10 The ship was refitted and rearmed in 1867‚Äì1868 with ten and two bronze RML guns.Silverstone, pp. 17, 26 Worn out and badly deteriorated by 1875, the ship was stricken from the naval register on 13 June. The Navy attempted to sell the ship to China, but the proposed sale came to nothing, and she was eventually sold for scrap in 1883 and broken up over the following year.Sondhaus, pp. 39, 70 Footnotes References   Category:Ships built in Trieste Category:1861 ships Category:Drache- class ironclads ","title":"SMS Drache (1861)"},{"id":"42367176","text":"Ruins of Takeda Castle is a ruined castle in the city of Asago, in the northern part of Hy≈çgo Prefecture, Japan.

Padukone won her second Filmfare Award for Best Actress, and Bachchan received his record setting fourth National Film Award for Best Actor at the 63rd National Film Awards and his record setting third Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor for his performance.  Plot  Piku Banerjee (Deepika Padukone) is a Bengali architect residing in Delhi, with her 70-year-old father, Bhashkor (Amitabh Bachchan). Bhashkor has problems with chronic constipation and traces every problem to his bowel movements. His habits often lead to quarrels with the servants and irritate Chhobi Mashi (Moushumi Chatterjee), who often visits them. Piku loves her father and, as her mother is no more, takes good care of him but gets extremely irritated with him at times because of his eccentricities. Her colleague, Syed Afroz (Jisshu Sengupta) is a good friend, and she is a regular client of Syed's friend, Rana Chaudhary's (Irrfan Khan) taxi business. Rana has his family problems with his mother and sister. Piku wants to sell their ancestral home in Kolkata, Champakunj, but Bhashkor objects vehemently and decides to go to Kolkata. Piku has to accompany him since she cannot let him travel alone. Bhashkor brings up his constipation problem and decides to travel by road. Due to Piku's problems with other drivers of Rana, they back away before Piku's trip. Piku, disappointed with the agency tries to book a flight, but soon, Rana arrives at their home to take the family to Kolkata himself, without informing his family about the trip. On the way, the group encounters many incidents, including Rana on the verge of losing patience due to Bhashkor's fussy behaviour and constipation. They finally reach Kolkata, where Piku's relatives live in the old house and Bhashkor asks Rana to stay for some time. Piku and Rana go out in the city and gradually grow close. Rana also subtly hints not to sell the house during a discussion. Rana leaves Kolkata the next day and asks Bhashkor to stop his eccentricities which he eventually listens to. Piku changes her mind and decides not to sell the house. Meanwhile, Bhashkor's sudden desire to bicycle increases as he cycles through a part of the city alone, leaving everyone tense since he did not tell them about it. When Bhashkor returns, Piku berates him for eating street food and for being irresponsible, but he simply states that his constipation is cleared and he needs to bicycle every day. He remembers Rana who had told him to eat everything and not be choosy and picky about food. Piku is secretly happy but does not emote much. The next day, everyone discovers that Bhashkor has died in his sleep, probably from sleep apnea or cardiac arrhythmia. Piku states that he always wanted a peaceful death. She returns to Delhi, where she arranges his funeral. There, Dr. Srivastava (Raghubir Yadav), Bhashkor's doctor, reveals to her that Syed, too, has constipation and Bhashkor knew about it for a long time. A few days later, she pays up whatever due she owes Rana. She renames the Delhi house \\"Bhaskor Villa\\" in her father's memory and the maid, who had left due to Bhashkor's tantrums, returns to work.

Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave Piku 4.5 out of 5 stars, writing that it is a \\"film with tremendous heart -- one that made me guffaw and made me weep and is making sure I'm smiling wide just thinking about it now -- but also a sharp film, with nuanced details showing off wit, progressive thought and insightful writing\\". In a 4 out of 5 star review, The Times of India praised the writing, direction and performances. Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph India gave an average of 7/10, saying \\"Don‚Äôt go in with a lot of laugh-out-loud expectations and you will enjoy Piku for what it is ‚Äì‚Äì a simple, slice-of-life bittersweet tale about a family fighting constipation\\". Gayatri Sankar of Zee News gave 4 out of 5 stars and wrote \\"In totality, Piku is a wonderful family film, which will certainly make you wear a broad smile.\\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and said \\"On the whole, Piku is a must watch this season as it brings back the memories of the legendary directors Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Basu Chatterjee and likes\\". Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave 4 stars out of five and said \\"Piku, directed by Shoojit Sircar, is a charming, unpredictable comedy that ‚Äì like Sircar\\"s Vicky Donor ‚Äì mines humor from the unlikeliest of places\\". Anuj Kumar of The Hindu gave it a positive review, saying \\"A slice of life that deals with the practical difficulties in loving your aging parents in a light-hearted, feel good way, Piku is a progressive piece of cinema that brings the parent back into the picture\\".

Anupama Chopra gave 4 out of 5 stars and said \\"Piku is a delightful film about very little and yet it says so much. This isn't a movie focused on reaching a destination. This is a movie about the journey, both literal and emotional\\".

Tanmaya Nanda of Business Standard praised the film for its feminist tone and its unique approach in dealing with scatological humour. Namrata Joshi of Outlook gave 3 out of 5 stars, and wrote \\"Piku goes into an atypical zone for a Hindi mainstream film. It breaks the plot-driven, high on drama rule and yet manages to forge a big connect with the audience; The slice-of-life film has characters, relationships and interactions that feel real and evoke empathy in viewers‚Äîbe they aging parents or their caregivers\\". On the contrary, Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave 2.5 out of 5, saying \\"Piku sparks in moments, and I threw my head back and guffawed in a few. But the rest of it stays only mildly amusing. I wanted more motion in these motions\\". Rachel Saltz of The New York Times wrote \\"Piku, directed by Shoojit Sircar from a script by Juhi Chaturvedi, isn't a typical Hindi movie. It lopes along, following no formula beyond the roughest outlines of a romantic comedy.\\" In 2019, Film Companion ranked Deepika's performance among 100 Greatest Performances of the decade.

Jointly produced by Bhansali and Eros International's Kishore Lulla, the film stars Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra. The supporting cast includes Tanvi Azmi, Vaibhav Tatwawaadi and Milind Soman. Based on the fictional Marathi novel Rau by Nagnath S. Inamdar, Bajirao Mastani narrates the story of the Maratha Peshwa Bajirao I (1700‚Äì1740 AD) and his second wife. Conceived as early as the 1990s, Bhansali announced the film in 2003 but production was delayed several times due to its changing cast. Bajirao Mastani, a passion project for Bhansali, spent the next eleven years in development hell before being revived in 2014. Extensive research was done before moving into pre-production, which required the creation of twenty-two highly detailed sets, and numerous costumes and props to strengthen its opulence and high production value. Principal photography took place on sets constructed in Film City, with some portions being filmed on location. Visual effects and CGI were used in post-production to enhance a number of scenes. The film was released on 18 December 2015 and praised for Bhansali's direction, various technical achievements, and the performances of the cast. Bajirao Mastani has also been noted for its scale, grandeur and attention to detail. With a budget of , including marketing and advertisements, it is one of the most expensive Hindi films. It has grossed over at the box office, becoming a major commercial success and one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time. The recipient of several accolades, Bajirao Mastani won 7 National Film Awards, including Best Direction and Best Supporting Actress for Azmi. It also received a leading 14 nominations at the 61st Filmfare Awards and won a leading 9 awards, including Best Film, Best Director for Bhansali, Best Actor for Singh, and Best Supporting Actress for Chopra. At the Zee Cine Awards, Singh won Critics Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Male and Padukone won Best Actor ‚Äì Female.  Plot  In the early 18th century, the court of Maratha king Chhatrapati Shahu needs a new Peshwa, the equivalent of a prime minister. Ambaji Pant nominates a young Bajirao. As a test, Bajirao is asked to split a peacock feather with an arrow. He succeeds and is given the Peshwa title. Ten years later, his wife Kashibai is visited by her widowed friend Bhanu, whose husband, accused of spying, was ordered to be executed by Bajirao. She predicts that just as she yearns for her husband, Kashibai will yearn for Bajirao. While travelling to Sironja, an emissary from Bundelkhand requests Bajirao's help to fight invaders. She reveals herself to be Mastani, the daughter of the Hindu Rajput king Chhatrasal and his Persian Muslim consort Ruhani Begum. Impressed by her skills as a warrior, Bajirao assists her with his army and defeats the invaders. Chhatrasal is overjoyed and insists Bajirao spend Holi with them. Mastani and Bajirao fall in love during this time and he gives her his dagger, unaware that it is a symbol of marriage among the Rajputs. Back home in Pune, Kashibai greets Bajirao with a tour of their newly built Shaniwar Wada and the Aaina Mahal (Hall of Mirrors), which allows her to see him from her room. Determined to pursue her love, Mastani arrives in Pune but is treated harshly by Bajirao's mother Radhabai and accommodated in the palace for courtesans, as Radhabai refuses to accept her as a daughter-in-law. Mastani tolerates this and adamantly expresses her desire to be with Bajirao; Bajirao chides her persistence, reminding her he is already married and will never fully be hers; his court will also never respect her. Mastani agrees to these conditions so Bajirao declares her his second wife. The Marathas prepare to attack Delhi, the capital of the Mughal Empire, but must first ensure the Nizam, the Muslim ruler of Hyderabad, will not attack them. Bajirao leaves to confront the Nizam, Qamar ud-Din Khan, and returns successful. Through her Aaina Mahal, a pregnant Kashibai sees Bajirao embracing Mastani, who is also expecting. Heartbroken, she leaves for her mother's home, and returns months later with her newborn son, who is named Raghunath. Mastani also gives birth to a son, named Krishna Rao. After the Brahmin priest refuses to conduct the Hindu naming ceremony on the grounds that Krishna Rao is illegitimate, Bajirao renames his son Shamsher Bahadur, deciding he will be raised Muslim. A few years later, Kashibai and Bajirao's eldest son Balaji Baji Rao, known as Nana Saheb, returns from Satara and expresses his hatred of Mastani for breaking his mother's marriage. Kashibai is informed of a plan to murder Mastani and her son during a festival. She saves Mastani by relaying this to an unaware Bajirao, who promptly rescues them. To keep Mastani safe and grant her a royal home, Bajirao builds a palace for her. He later leaves for the battlefield to defeat Nasir Jung, the vengeful son of the Nizam. Before leaving, he meets Kashibai in deference to the tradition that the wife see her husband into battle. In tears, Kashibai explains that Bajirao broke her heart and took her pride with what he has done, and compares their love with that of Krishna and Rukmini. She asks him never to enter her chamber again, and a teary-eyed Bajirao accepts, apologising for hurting her. Once Bajirao leaves, his mother and Nana Saheb imprison Mastani and her son. After Bajirao receives the news, he singlehandedly defeats Nasir Jung's army in his rage but is fatally injured. At Bajirao's deathbed, Kashibai sends a letter pleading with his mother to release Mastani so that he recovers. Nana Saheb burns the letter, though Mastani's son is set free. Bajirao, delirious from his illness, hallucinates and dies as Kashibai helplessly watches; at the same time, Mastani dies in captivity. The ill-fated lovers are united in death.  Cast  The cast is listed below:  Production  = Development = alt=A photograph of Sanjay Leela Bhansali looking towards the camera Sanjay Leela Bhansali had conceived the historical romance about Maratha Peshwa Bajirao and his second wife Mastani even before he had directed his first feature Khamoshi: The Musical in 1996. Several other directors such as Muzaffar Ali, Manmohan Desai and Kamal Amrohi had tried to make a film about the two historical figures but they were never made. Bhansali had intended to make Bajirao Mastani after the release of Devdas (2002) and had officially announced it in 2003, with filming scheduled to begin in May 2004. The film, however, was shelved indefinitely. Reports about a possible revival had made headlines ever since; Bhansali had planned to revive it every other year but the project never came to fruition. In an interview with The Telegraph, Bhansali spoke about his intention to make Bajirao Mastani after finishing every film he made in-between, saying \\"I kept trying to revive it over and over again, but if there is one thing that filmmaking has taught me, it's that every film has its own destiny. And I strongly believe that the souls of ... Bajirao, Mastani and Kashibai wanted us to make this film only now.\\" In the process, the film became a passion project for him. After spending eleven years in development hell, Bhansali revived the project in 2014; the film was reported to be an adaptation of the Marathi-language novel Raau (1976) by Nagnath S. Inamdar. After the project was shelved, Bhansali said he struggled to put the film together and that he considered the project impossible to make. Nevertheless, he clung to his ambition to make the film someday, saying, \\"there is magic to it\\". Some film industry professionals believed it would never be made, calling it \\"jinxed\\". Bhansali always believed in the project, assuring himself the script was so powerful he had to make it one day. He told The Telegraph, \\"Honestly, I want very few things in life ... so I know that I am resilient enough to get them all! Deep down, I kept asking for the universe to let me make this film. When you dream very genuinely, then I believe you also get the power to fulfill it. In pursuing Bajirao Mastani, I have been resilient and very focused. I have sacrificed a lot of things\\". Primarily known for making romantic dramas, Bhansali was intrigued about the romance between \\"two people who defied everything, just to be in love with each other\\", and was excited to tell a 200-year-old story. He wanted to show the relationship between Bajirao and Mastani because it was rarely depicted in history books, and little was known about it. He had long admired the Maratha backdrop and the different religions of the protagonistsBajirao was Hindu and Mastani was Muslimwhich further drove his interest towards knowing more and telling the story. He saw it as a chance to comment on religion and love, saying, \\"In those times, people were offended by the same things that offend them today. Through this film, I want to show that love is the greatest religion.\\" Prakash R. Kapadia wrote the screenplay. The makers acquired the rights of the novel and worked with historian Ninad Bedekar. Kapadia said writing the screenplay was a difficult task and a huge responsibility considering the historical context. Kapadia and Bhansali had consistently worked on the script since its conception, refining several aspects of the film. Considering the script was written twelve years before, several changes were made to it, such as the decreasing the length and increasing the pace to suit the modern audiences. Although adapted from the novel, the romance between the film's protagonists has not been well documented in history books or archives and several versions of the story exist. Many cinematic liberties were taken to build drama and highlight incidents. = Casting = Bhansali originally wanted to repeat his Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999) pairing of Salman Khan with Aishwarya Rai for the eponymous roles, but could not cast them together after their highly publicised break-up. Khan then tried to suggest his then-girlfriend Katrina Kaif for the role of Mastani but things did not materialise. When the film was finally announced in 2003, Bhansali had cast Khan and Kareena Kapoor in the titular roles, with Rani Mukerji playing Baji Rao's first wife Kashibai. However, the idea was scrapped when Khan and Kapoor signed other films together. Bhansali wanted to be the first director to showcase their pairing. Hence, the film was shelved and Bhansali went on to direct other films. Ranveer Singh (left) and Deepika Padukone (right) were cast to play the titular roles. Over the following ten years, media speculation about the production and casting of Bajirao Mastani continued. After the film was revived in 2014, reports of Ajay Devgn and Deepika Padukone being approached for the film made headlines in February. Devgn dropped out of the film, however, due to differences with Bhansali about several terms of his contract, such as dates and remuneration. The next month, it was reported that Ranveer Singh was in talks to play Bajirao. The same month, reports suggested Priyanka Chopra was cast to play Kashibai, Bajirao's first wife. In July 2014, it was officially confirmed that Singh, Padukone and Chopra were finalised to play the principal roles. Chopra was the first actor to be cast in the film; Bhansali wanted Kashibai to be cast first, only after which he could decide whom to cast for the title roles. Bhansali, who produced Chopra-starrer Mary Kom (2014), went on to that film's set in Manali to narrate it with the writer Prakash Kapadia; Bhansali was adamant in his choice of Chopra, who recalled, \\"The rest of the film hadn't been cast yet. My picture would be there and the pictures for Bajirao and Mastani would keep changing.\\" Milind Soman joined the cast in the late August 2014. In late September 2014, it was confirmed that Tanvi Azmi was cast for the role of Bajirao's mother Radhabai; Shabana Azmi, Dimple Kapadia, and Supriya Pathak had also been considered for the role. The following month, Aditya Pancholi joined the cast as an antagonist. In November 2014, the casting of Bajirao's sisters were finalised; Sukhada Khandkekar was ast as Anubai and Anuja Gokhale as Bhiubai. The following month, Mahesh Manjrekar was cast to play Maratha Emperor Chhattrapati Shahu. It was announced in January 2015 that Vaibhav Tatwawaadi was chosen to play Bajirao's younger brother Chimaji Appa. Irrfan Khan was cast as the film's narrator. All of the actors had to undergo training before filming began; Singh and Padukone learned sword-fighting, horse-riding and the ancient Indian martial art Kalaripayattu. Singh was also required to learn Marathi and shave his head for the part, whereas Padukone had to take Kathak dance lessons. In preparation for her role of Kashibai, Chopra had 15 days of language training in the Peshwai Marathi dialect spoken during the time of the ascension of the Peshwas to perfect the accent. Azmi shaved her head completely for her role. Singh has described his character as a \\"true Maratha\\", saying, \\"The deeper I get into it the more I realise what a great man he was. It is a great honour to be selected to play this character.\\" He has said he always wanted to transform himself into a character and playing Bajirao gave him that scope, which he said was \\"draining and tiring in every way\\". For portraying Bajirao, Singh's preparations required him to isolate himself from his own being and living like Bajirao. He instructed the crew members to address him as Bajirao, which helped him to remain in his character. Singh would not respond to people who used his real name. He said, \\"It takes a lot of work and effort to be different from whom I am, and two hours to get ready, complete with makeup and the heavy costumes. After all this, if someone just tells me, Ranveer, your shot is ready! all that goes to waste.\\" Padukone found her character to be very relatable, saying, \\"She was so brave, strong, determined and yet fragile and vulnerable\\". She was also inspired by her character and found playing the role challenging; it was physically demanding and required a lot of dancing. Padukone said the character had different layers; \\"One minute she goes on the battlefield, the next minute she's romancing him\\". Chopra was drawn towards the film because of her character which she thought was \\"very heart-breaking\\". She said playing Kashibai was \\"emotionally difficult\\" and a complete contrast to the strong women she has portrayed in most of her films. She described her character as someone who is \\"heartbroken, a silent sufferer, dignified, resilient, can't take charge of her life, goes with whatever life throws her way. Just grace under fire.\\" = Pre-production = Considering its scale, the film required detailed and extravagant pre-production work, which required extensive research and planning. Saloni Dhatrak, Sriram Iyengar and Sujeet Sawant worked as production designers on the film. Iyengar and Sawant had heard about the film while working on another film, when it was first announced. Having never met Bhansali, they started researching on their own by visiting Pune and Satara and learnt about Maratha architecture. When the film was shelved, they continued to research and formed a portfolio, hoping to approach other filmmakers for work. Several years later, when they heard about the revival, they met Bhansali, who was impresses by their research and presentation. Bhansali wanted more research on Mughals; he engaged Dhatrak, who joined Iyengar and Sawant. Bhansali then shared the script with the art directors and described his vision and the scale of the production. Pre- production work started as early as February 2014, continued as the shoot progressed and lasted until the filming was complete in October 2015; it lasted nineteen months. Before pre-production work started, the art directors discussed with Bhansali about how much of the film would be filmed on set and outdoor locations, giving them an idea to how many sets they needed to create. Once the number of sets and location shots was decided, the production moved forward. The set for Shaniwar Wada was the biggest set created for the film. Along with the art directors, nineteen art assistant directors, including architects, designers, sketch artists and props artists, were involved. Twenty-two sets were created in Film City following a flow chart that included around 960 sketches and countless layouts. The two biggest sets were the exact replicas of Shaniwar Wada and the Aaina Mahal, both of which were \\"high on grandeur and intricacy\\". The Shaniwar Wada set was the biggest set they had constructed; it took 45,000 planks and 600 workers a day to erect. It was constructed on Sunil Maidan, one of the biggest open spaces in Film City and took forty-five days to build. Kashibai's room was the first set to be constructed, which was approved after navigating through twenty-five designs. The art directors did architectural research from Pune, Nasik and Satara, studying fortifications, baston walls and city gates to understand the interior and exterior designs of the ancient period and incorporated those ideas into building Kashibai's villa. Lotus motifs on mud-clad walls and handmade textures were used to give the set a realistic appearance. Aina Mahal took 4,500 planks, with a hundred workers per day. The set was given a lotus- like design, with walls, ceiling and floor made out of handmade mud embedded with sparkling mirror designs. The replica of Aina Mahal was constructed in forty days, with more than 30,000 square feet of mirrors. More than 700 design stencils were used to decorate the hall. Although the mirror hall was a Mughal concept, the art directors designed it to look like Maratha architecture. Mastani Mahal was built as an amalgamation of Rajput and Maratha architecture. The exterior of Mastani Mahal was built as a part of Shaniwar Wada, whereas the interiors of were built on separate sets consisting of a courtyard and bedroom. Mastani's room in Bundelkhand was crafted using a mix of Persian, Mughal and Rajput motifs and architecture. All of the sets were furnished with opulent objects and props to give the interiors a feel of the ancient Maratha empire. Only earthen diyas and torches were used to light the sets. Silken saris were used, with bedsheets and hand-painted walls with 18th century motifs added. Craftsmen were hired to recreate 18th-century textures, fabrics, weaponry, jewellery and furniture. Almost 30,000 oil lamps were made for the film and 500 suits of armour were designed for the war scenes. There were also headgear and boots worn in that period. The armour and headgear weighed between ten-twenty kilos and two kilos, respectively. The team also designed props including different types of tents, lighting props, and elephant and horse decors for the war sequences. The props were made in Mumbai and had to be taken to Rajasthan, the outdoor location. = Costumes = The paintings of Raja Ravi Varma was used as an inspiration for creating Kashibai's look The film's costumes were designed by Anju Modi and Maxima Basu. Modi designed clothes for the three lead characters and Basu designed for the supporting cast. The costumes for extras and war extras were done by Ajay and Chandrakant, respectively. Bhansali had detailed script-reading sessions with the designers to help them understand the characters, their emotions and personalities, which would mirror the costumes and the grandeur of the 18th century. Basu started her research by visiting several ancient monuments such as the Chowmahalla Palace, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, Salar Jung Museum and Ajanta-Ellora caves, which gave her some perspective of ancient Maharastrian culture. She also travelled to cities such as Indore, Chanderi, Paithan and Maheshwar to gather more knowledge about the history of clothing and textiles. About 300 costumes were designed for the three leads alone. Real zari and gold wires were used to weave the costumes. Since no pictures of Kashibai existed, the paintings of Raja Ravi Varma were used as a reference for designing her looks and costumes. Modi had designed eighty nauvari or nine-yard saris with bright colours such as yellows, hot pink, emerald green and purple, inspired from the Raja Ravi Varma paintings, for Chopra. The custom-made nine-yard saris were weaved by craftsmen from Maheshwar, Chander and Varanasi; they were made a little lighter than usual to avoid making Chopra look large on screen. For making the saris, fabrics such as silk, muslin, khadi and chanderi worn in that period were designed. For one song sequence featuring Chopra, Modi had created six sets of the same sari. Peshwas used to wear Dhotis, Jamas and Angarkhas with a large flare in that period, so it was eminent for Bajirao's character. A wide palette of solid colours, such as white and cream, were used for the sombre and emotional scenes whereas red, orange, blue and deep purple were used for the celebratory scenes. For designing the Bajirao's armour, chain mail, khaki and steel grey were employed. A dandpatta sword was also made for him. For Mastani, Modi used a mix of Persian and Muslim clothing of muslin, khadi and thin chanderi fabrics, with and zardosi hand embroidery to depict her half-Muslim heritage. Padukone was predominantly given shararas and its derivatives such trailing shararas, shararas with less flare and crinkled shararas made of chiffon. She was given a lehenga for just one scene. She was also given Odhnis, dupattas, veils, floor-skimming anarkalis and paired with Farshi Pajamas. Softer colours with Persian influences such as shades of powder blue, mint green, pale yellow, aqua blue, powder pink and other typical porcelain colours were used for her clothes. A turban embellished with jewellery such as uncut diamonds and pearls was designed. For one of the Mastani costumes, Modu designed a five-layered outfit consisting of an jacket, a woven leheria dupatta, sharara and inner kurti. Expensive and real jewellery was used in the film. The designers created the jewellery for each character. Modi said they did not want to compromise, so the best materials such as real Basra pearls, antique stones and uncut diamonds were used to give the royal look needed for the characters. Traditional Marathi-style jewellery was used to style Kashibai, while for Mastani Nizami and polki Jewellery was used. Several Indian jewellery designers, including PN Gadgil from Pune and Shri Hari Jewellers from Delhi, were hired. The costume and production designers also researched in museums, art galleries, history books, paintings, palaces, temples and forts to study the textiles, colour palettes and artwork of the ancient Maratha Empire. = Principal photography = Cinematographer Sudeep Chatterjee shot the film using Arri Alexa XT lenses. Chatterjee had done extensive research before starting the film. Principal photography began on 9 October 2014 with Chopra on the set in Film City, Mumbai. Later that month, Singh joined the shoot. Most of the film was shot on the highly detailed sets. In late November, Chopra fainted on the set due to exhaustion while filming a scene that needed to be filmed ten times continuously. A doctor was called and filming stopped for some time but she later resumed the shoot. Padukone joined the cast for two days during late December 2014 and resumed shooting in April 2015 after completing work for her other projects. Outdoor location filming began in February 2015 at Amer Fort in Jaipur. Crowd scenes were also filmed there. Singh fell off a horse while filming an action sequence and was rushed to hospital; he was not seriously injured. In May 2015, however, he injured his shoulder and needed surgery; he resumed shooting after break of two months. Some of the outdoor scenes were filmed at the Amer Fort Chopra resumed filming in the first week of April 2015 for a month. While working on Bajirao Mastani, Chopra was simultaneously filming the American television series Quantico in Montreal, requiring much back-and forth travel. She would act for Bajirao Mastani at weekends and return to Montreal on weekdays for her series, returning to India in the second week of October to complete the final schedule. Before starting the film, the team discussed which parts of it had to be filmed and which parts needed to be made using visual effects. They decided that only sequences that were considered difficult or impossible to film would be created using visual effects in post production. In one sequence, it was impossible to control the movements of the 300‚Äì400 horses standing at one position in a battle scene; this sequence was filmed with a small number of horses and was later enhanced in post production. Sham Kaushal co-ordinated the action sequences for the war scenes. Three war sequences were filmed in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Chatterjee found the war sequences challenging and faced many difficulties while filming in the deserts of Rajasthan. Wanting to break with norms, Bhansali wanted a night-time war sequence; lighting a large, open field became very difficult and visibility issues were inevitable. Bhansali wanted very clear images. Instead, they decided to shoot these scenes in the morning, aiming for a twilight look. The main war scene featuring 800 extras, 500 horses and twenty-five elephants was filmed over twenty days near Jaipur. The extras would begin costuming, which included beards for the Mughals, moustaches for the Marathas, armours, helmets and uniforms, at 04:00 for the start of filming at 08:00. After finishing the shoot, the costumes would be washed in readiness for 04:00 the following day. Kaushal has said extensive research was done before filming the war sequences, and a rough graph was designed nine months before the filming. However, the entire sequence could not be filmed in one take on location and was completed later in a studio in Film City, and was enhanced in post production. Ganesh Acharya, Remo D'Souza, Pony Verma, Shampa Gopikrishna and Pandit Birju Maharaj were the choreographers for the film's song sequences. Bhansali chose D'Souza, who had only choreographed modern dance numbers at that time, to choreograph the song \\"Pinga\\", which took weeks to complete. Chopra and Padukone had to rehearse for several days before shooting. The filming was challenging for Chopra and Padukone; they had to shoot for the dance sequences multiple times whenever the diyas and torches used to light up the background would snuff. The song was shot at night on an open-air set decorated with diyas and torches, many of which would snuff out while filming the song. When it was suggested snuffed diyas should be corrected in post production, Bhansali outright refused. More than twelve people would run around the set with candles and oil to relight them. The sound recording was done on location. Sound designer Nihar Ranjan Samal said they had to be careful that sounds of vehicles and honking did not make their way into the recording. A number of scenes needed re-recording because of some disturbance. Bajirao Mastani was shot in 217 days between October 2014 and October 2015. = Post-production = The film contains 1,400 visual effects shots. The company that worked on the effects was NY VFXWAALA; this was the biggest projects they had undertaken. Prasad Sutar was the visual effects supervisor; the effects took eight months and a team of sixty artists to create. Although the film was shot on highly detailed sets, visual effects and CGI was incorporated in post- production to enhance the imagery for the scenes that were impossible to shoot in live action. The effects included the creation of interior architecture, backgrounds, set extensions and war weapons; changes to lighting and time of day, weather effects and the multiplication of army soldiers. The opening night-time war scene, which had 300 visual effects shots, was filmed in bright daylight then converted into night. Arrows flying over the battlefield were created using CGI whereas the army, soldiers and horses were multiplied. The war close-up shots were filmed in a studio but were later mixed with the war scenes to form a detailed scene. In some shots, the sky was digitally replaced and CGI forts were added in others. Similarly, the climax sequence, which was shot live in water, was enhanced using CGI horses, arrows and fireballs. The climax scene took around twenty days to complete with fine details. Bhansali wanted a grand opening title design, which the team decided to create using animation. They crafted hand-drawn storyboards and drew a narration of Bajirao and his kingdom, and designed it digitally using animation within a limited timeline. A sequence in which Singh crosses the sea in a boat at night was created using visual effects. Splashing waves, falling rain falling (except for the water falling on Singh and the night sky were created in post production. The scenes that were shot on set and featured outside views, such as views from windows, were completed in post production. For dark, emotional scenes, a low-key background was created, whereas bright, colourful backgrounds were created with effects for light scenes. The film was edited by Rajesh G. Pandey.  Soundtrack  The original score of the film was composed by Sanchit Balhara and the soundtrack album was composed by Bhansali. The lyrics are written by Siddharth‚ÄìGarima, A. M. Turaz and Prashant Ingole. The album consists of ten original songs with vocals by Shreya Ghoshal, Arijit Singh, Vishal Dadlani, Shashi Suman, Kunal Pandit, Prithvi Gandharva, Kanika Joshi, Rashi Raagga, Geetikka Manjrekar, Payal Dev, Shreyas Puranik, Vaishali Mhade, Javed Bashir, Ganesh Chandanshive and Sukhwinder Singh. The soundtrack was released by Eros Music on 31 October 2015. The soundtrack album was well received by music critics, who praised the soulful compositions and called them \\"melodious and fresh\\". R.M. Vijayakar of India-West gave the album 4.5 out of 5, calling it \\"unforgettable\\" and complimented the use of musical instruments and orchestration, noting portions of the score as the most significant standout. Firstpost gave a highly positive review, praising the \\"elegantly arranged and opulently orchestrated\\" songs and writing, \\"exhilarating soundtrack ... recreates an era gone-by through sounds that are authentic ... yet operatic, steeped in the classical ethos, yet contemporary\\". Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama gave a rating of 3.5 out of 5, calling it \\"high on classical base\\" and saying half of the compositions were situational and narrative-based that can \\"be expected to make a good impression on screen\\". The Indian Express also gave it a 3.5 out of 5, noting its distinct sound and its \\"balance between restraint and exuberance\\" and wrote, \\"Bajirao Mastani sounds fresh, like carefully restored music from Bajirao's times\\".  Marketing and release  Bajirao Mastani was one of the most anticipated releases of 2015. Special care was taken to avoid leaks during production; everything was done in secrecy. On 15 July 2015, a day before the teaser release, producers Eros International shared the first images of the three characters and a teaser poster of the film. The three-minute teaser trailer, with only one line of dialogue, was released on 16 July 2015. The teaser garnered high praise from all quarters and was deemed \\"grand\\" and \\"epic\\". CNN- News18 called the teaser \\"regal, grand and breathtaking\\", and wrote that it had all the signature Bhansali elements such as \\"the big sets, larger than life characters, lots of colours and a tragic love story in the midst of all this grandeur\\". India Today wrote, \\"With its royal canvas, Bajirao Mastani teaser is a burst of colours and action reminiscent of the 18th century\\". In early November 2015, characters posters of the three characters were also unveiled. The trailer was released on 20 November 2015 and was also well received. As a part of the promotions, a multi-episode graphic web series ‚ÄìIndia's first ‚Äì titled Blazing Bajirao was released digitally in November 2015. Featuring the animated avatars of Bajirao, Kashibai and Mastani, the graphic series narrates the tales of Bajirao's heroism and his relationship with his two wives. This was followed by a video game titled Blazing Bajirao ‚Äì The Game the next month. Released on the App Store and Google Play, the interactive game requires its players to fight enemies as Peshwa Bajirao. A multi-city press tour, which saw Singh and Padukone visiting several cities, was designed to promote the film. Chopra, who could not be in India for the promotions as she was filming for Quantico, promoted the film in the United States at a press conference in New York City. Even before its release and without watching the film, the descendants of Bajirao, Mastani and Kashiabi expressed their disapproval of \\"Malhari\\" and \\"Pinga\\" dance sequences, the midriff-baring saris worn by Kashibai and Mastani in the song \\"Pinga\\", a dialogue deeming it \\"vulgar\\" and a \\"private moment\\" shown in the trailer, claiming excessive creative liberty was taken by the director. Though not against the release of the film, the descendants publicly asked the makers to remove those two songs and screen the film for them so they could review and suggest Bhansali remove other \\"objectionable content\\" from the film. Bhansali did not respond. Additionally, a petition was filed by an activist in Bombay High Court seeking stay on the film for the two aforementioned songs, accusing it of \\"distorting history\\"; the High Court rejected the petition and refused to interfere with the film's release. One of the most expensive Hindi films ever made, Bajirao Mastani cost 1.25 billion to make and an additional 200 million for marketing and advertisements; its total budget was 1.45 billion. Even before its release, the film recovered almost all of its production costs ‚Äì 1.20 billion ‚Äì from sales of its satellite rights, music rights and overseas rights being sold for 500 million and 700 million, respectively. The film was released on 18 December 2015 on 2,700 screens worldwide. Although the makers had booked the date a year in advance, the makers of Dilwale decided to release their film on the same date, causing a highly publicised clash between the two films. Bajirao Mastani had to share the 5,000 domestic screens with Dilwale in a 40:60 ratio. Distributed by Eros Home Video, the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 18 March 2016. The DVD version was released in all regions as a two-disc pack in NTSC widescreen format; bonus content included documentaries about the making of the film, its sets, costumes, music, movie images and deleted scenes. A VCD version was released at the same time. The film was also released digitally on platforms such as iTunes. It is also available on the company's streaming service Eros Now. Bajirao Mastani had its world television premiere on 23 April 2016 on Colors.  Reception  = Critical response = Bajirao Mastani received positive critical feedback. Writing for Firstpost, Subhash K. Jha gave it five stars out of five, calling it a \\"masterpiece\\", and comparing it favourably with Mughal-e-Azam. Anupama Chopra from Hindustan Times gave four stars out of five, terming it \\"soaring, searing and visually sumptuous\\", and writing, \\"Bajirao Mastani plays out a like an operatic, swooning, feverish love poem\\". She praised Singh for \\"combin[ing] towering strength with aching vulnerability and helplessness\\", Chopra for having the \\"maximum impact\\" despite fewer scenes, and called Padukone \\"riveting\\". The Times of India also gave four stars out of five, pointing out its \\"outstanding\\" cinematography and writing, \\"Every visual resembles a grand painting ‚Äì courts with shadows and chandeliers, courtiers with tilaks and teers, chambers gleaming with mirrors, skies blushing with passion\\". Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama gave four stars out of five, describing it as \\"a cinematic gem\\", and wrote that \\"fascinating characters and inspirational sub-plots [in the film] advances into a stunning culmination\\". Zee News also gave four stars out of five and said, \\"An outright outshining piece of art made unblemished, sprinkled with sincerity and discipline of acting ‚Äì this love folklore will restore the drama lovers, back in their ‚Äòexpectation‚Äô block\\". Shubha Shetty-Saha of Mid Day gave three and a half stars out of five, and wrote, \\"Sanjay Leela Bhansali in his characteristic style narrates his version of the story in a Mughal-e-azamesque scale of grandiosity, replete with breathtakingly beautiful sets, elaborate and well thought of costumes and accessories and dreamy cinematography\\", which transports the viewers to a \\"unique and stunningly beautiful world\\". Ananya Bhattacharya of India Today also rated the film three and a half stars out of five, calling it \\"an experience\\", and Bhansali \\"a master love-storyteller\\". She praised the performance, saying, \\"Ranveer, Deepika, Priyanka shine ... while Tanvi Azmi plays the intimidating matriarch with elan\\"; thought she thought the editing \\"could have been much crisper\\". Writing for NDTV, Saibal Chatterjee gave the film three and a half stars out of five, and said, \\"There isn't a dull moment in this colourful and dramatic film that embraces excess with unabashed abandon\\". Giving a rating of three stars out of five, Rajeev Masand described the film as \\"artistic but exhausting\\" and was critical of the film's length. He praised the cinematography, production design and performances; he credited Chopra for bringing \\"grace to the character, and practically steal[ing] the film\\", Padukone for bringing \\"heft\\" to her fight scenes, and Singh for finding his character's hidden vulnerabilities. Namrata Joshi of The Hindu called the film a \\"historical leap\\", and wrote, \\"Sanjay Leela Bhansali returns with another visual spectacle that wilfully takes liberties with the past that it depicts. But it does manage to engage even as it exhausts.\\" Conversely, Raja Sen of Rediff.com was unimpressed with the film for favouring visual splendour over storyline, rating it two stars out of five. He praised Singh and Chopra, but disliked Padukone's performance. Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express was also disappointed with the film, writing, \\"Bajirao Mastani had the potential to be a terrific historical. You want to be transported. What it ends up being is a costume drama: too many costumes, too much revved-up, empty drama, and too little plot.\\" = Box office = Bajirao Mastani was a major commercial success, grossing over 2.55 billion in India and over 1.02 billion in the overseas market for a worldwide box office gross of over 3.56 billion. The overseas collections comprised earnings from five major markets; United States and Canada, United Kingdom, Middle-east, Australia and the rest of the world; with earnings of 440 million, 138 million, 202 million, 57 million and 185 million, respectively. As of September 2017, it is the fourth-highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2015, the third-highest-grossing Bollywood film in overseas markets in 2015, the ninth-highest-grossing Bollywood film and one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time. The film collected 128 million nett on its opening day, which was the tenth-highest of the year. On its second day the film saw growth in its collection as it collected 155.2 million nett. The film showed further growth on its third day as it collected 184.5 million nett to take its first weekend total to 467.7 million nett. In its opening weekend, the film debuted at number 10 at the U.S. box office and at number 7 at the UK box office. The film's worldwide opening weekend earning was over 915 million. The film remained very strong on its first Monday, dropping by only 15% and earning 102.5 million nett. The film maintained its strong box office run on weekdays. Bajirao Mastani earned 843.6 million nett in the first week at the domestic box office, while the first-week worldwide collections were over 1.6 billion. Its first week domestic collection was the fourth-highest of the year. Revenues grew nearly 20% on its second Friday, earning 125 million nett. The film earned over 311 billion in its second weekend and collected a further 52.5 million on the second Monday for an eleven-day domestic total of 1.41 billion nett. In the second week, the film earned approximately 552 million. The film registered the fourth-highest third-week collections of all time, earning a 270 million. After its fourth week collection of 70 million, the film's domestic earnings stood at 1.75 billion nett. In its fifth weekend, the film continued to perform well in India, with the best fifth-weekend collections of all the 2015 releases. = Accolades = Bajirao Mastani received five nominations at the 10th Asian Film Awards, including Best Film, and won the award for Best Special Effects. At the 63rd National Film Awards, Bajirao Mastani received seven awards, including Best Director for Bhansali, Best Supporting Actress for Azmi, Best Cinematography for Chatterjee, and Best Art Direction. It received fourteen nominations at the 61st Filmfare Awards; the most awards for any film that year. Bajirao Mastani went on to win nine awards, more than any other film at the ceremony, including Best Film, Best Director for Bhansali, Best Actor for Singh, and Best Supporting Actress for Chopra. Bajirao Mastani received thirteen nominations at the 22nd Screen Awards, including Best Film, and Best Director for Bhansali, and won seven including Best Actor for Singh, and Best Supporting Actress for Chopra. It also won a leading thirteen awards (from seventeen nominations) at the 17th IIFA Awards including Best Director for Bhansali, Best Actor for Singh, and Best Supporting Actress for Chopra.  Historical inaccuracies  The film was adapted from the novel Rau, whose accuracy has long been questioned. Bhansali consulted historian Ninad Bedekar, who is regarded as an authority on the Peshwas. According to an article published by Quartz, the \\"love story\\" of Bajirao and Mastani is \\"almost entirely fictional\\", writing that even the most reliable sources do not give details about the nature of their relationship. There has been controversy over Mastani's true lineage; two accounts of Mastani exist one which says she was a courtesan and Bajirao's mistress or concubine, and another that is depicted in the film. According to historian Saili Palande-Datar, very little is known about the women of that era due to the orthodoxy; women were not given many privileges and rights, and most of the sources from that period are accounts of political battles, revenues and socio-economic records. Palande-Datar also said that there is no evidence of the way Bajirao and Mastani's political marriage became part of folklore and was later transformed into a symbolic representation of great romance. Historian Prachi Deshpande notes in her book Creative Pasts: Historical Memory and Identity in Western India, 1700‚Äì1960, that the public fascination started after their romanticisation began in the 1890s, more than 150 years after they had died, after Marathi playwrights began writing a series of nationalistic plays based on the historical figures. The first such play that portrayed them as a star crossed couple was Bajirao-Mastani (1892) by N B Kanitkar. Quartz also said the play portrayed them as star crossed lovers and others playwrights followed Kantikar, making it as familiar to Marathi audiences as that of other epic romances. By the 1930s, a number of historical novels that also added to the \\"myth-making\\" were written, fascinating another generation. The film gives a more of a personal account of Bajirao's life, which is hard to prove since it has not been covered much by the historians. Bhansali has said it was his interpretation of how Bajirao was in his home and in personal life, and there was no way to know that. Because of this lack of information, Bhansali took liberties with historical facts and exaggerated a few things for cinematic effects. A disclaimer on the film's credits stated it does not claim to be historically accurate. The dance sequences have been widely seen as \\"fictional\\" and \\"out of place\\" in historical context. Bajirao's dance sequence in \\"Malhari\\" has been criticised, saying a chief minister such as Bajirao would never dance in public. Similarly, the \\"Pinga\\" dance sequence between Kashibai and Mastani has been deemed \\"inappropriate\\" for women of that era. Some historians have said that apart from the inappropriateness of a woman of Kashibai's stature dancing in public, she suffered from a type of arthritis and that dancing was not physically possible for her. While some historians have claimed both women met socially only once; others have said they never met at all. Mastani was put under house arrest by Balaji while Bajirao was on military campaign, as opposed to film's depiction of Mastani's imprisonment. The film shows Bajirao and Mastani dying at the same time in different places, which did not happen in reality. Bajirao died a few days earlier than Mastani; however the cause of her death is not known. Some have claimed she died from shock; other accounts say she committed suicide. The film portrays Mastani being chained at the time of her death but she was never chained and she and Kashibai were both present at Bajirao's last rites. After the death of Mastani, Kashibai raised Mastani's son as her own, which is not shown in the film. Other inaccuracies include Mastani playing a mandolin, an instrument that originated in Europe during the 19th century.

It is a metropolitan district council, one of four in South Yorkshire and one of 36 in the metropolitan counties of England. The council was created by the Local Government Act 1972. In February 2015 the elected council had its powers suspended and transferred to commissioners appointed by HM Government after it was severely criticised by the Casey report into the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal. Power is being returned to the council in phases, with the council expected to fully regain its powers by March 2019. History The current local authority was first elected in 1973, a year before formally coming into its powers and prior to the creation of the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham on 1 April 1974. The council gained borough status, entitling it to be known as Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council. It was envisaged through the Local Government Act 1972 that Rotherham as a metropolitan local authority would share power with the South Yorkshire County Council. The split of powers and functions meant that the South Yorkshire County Council was responsible for \\"wide area\\" services such as fire, ambulance and waste disposal with the district authorities responsible for \\"personal\\" services such as social care, libraries, education and refuse collection. This arrangement lasted until 1986 when Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council gained responsibility for some services that had been provided by the South Yorkshire County Council. The Local Government Act 1985 directed the councils of South Yorkshire to form joint arrangements, which are coordinated by the South Yorkshire Joint Secretariat, in order to deliver these functions. Powers and functions The local authority derives its powers and functions from the Local Government Act 1972 and subsequent legislation. For the purposes of local government, Rotherham is within a metropolitan area of England. It provides the majority of local government services in Rotherham, including Council Tax billing, libraries, social services, processing planning applications, waste collection and disposal, and it is a local education authority. The council appoints members to South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Authority, the South Yorkshire Police and Crime Panel and it is a constituent council of the Sheffield City Region Combined Authority. Political control Councillors are elected from 21 wards. Each ward returns three members, giving a total of 63 councillors. Commissioners In February 2015 the elected council was suspended and replaced by commissioners appointed by the government after it was severely criticised by the Casey report into the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal. The commissioners were later named as Sir Derek Myers (lead commissioner), Stella Manzie (managing director commissioner), Malcolm Newsam (children's social care commissioner), Mary Ney and Julie Kenny (supporting commissioners). The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, said that they would remain in charge of the council until March 2019, though he expected that there would be a \\"phased roll back of powers to the authority as and when there can be confidence that the authority could exercise a function in compliance with the best value duty, and in the case of children's social care, to the required standard.\\" See also * South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner * Shaun Wright References External links *Council website * Category:Metropolitan district councils of England Category:Local authorities in South Yorkshire Category:Leader and cabinet executives Category:Local education authorities in England Category:Billing authorities in England Category:1974 establishments in England ","title":"Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council"},{"id":"42367355","text":"A minelaying German Type UC I submarine A coastal submarine or littoral submarine is a small, maneuverable submarine with shallow draft well suited to navigation of coastal channels and harbors. Although size is not precisely defined, coastal submarines are larger than midget submarines, but smaller than sea-going submarines designed for longer patrols on the open ocean. Space limitations aboard coastal submarines restrict fuel availability for distant travel, food availability for extended patrol duration, and number of weapons carried. Within those limitations, however, coastal submarines may be able to reach areas inaccessible to larger submarines, and be more difficult to detect. History The earliest submarines were effectively coastal submarines, but as modern submarine tactics developed during World War I, the advantages of rapid construction and portability encouraged development of UB torpedo launching, and UC minelaying coastal submarines in 1915 to operate in the English Channel. These coastal submarines displaced only 15 to 20 percent the weight of a contemporary conventional U-boat,Gray, pp.226&228 could be built in one-quarter the time it took to complete a conventional U-boat, and be delivered on railway wagons to operating bases in Belgium.Tarrant, pp.15-24 Improved versions of UB and UC coastal submarines were devised.

The Six-Day War of 1899: Hong Kong in the Age of Imperialism. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press. 2008. . The British quickly and decisively ended armed resistance, but to prevent future resistance made concessions to placate the indigenous inhabitants. Despite losing to the better equipped British military, they achieved their ultimate goal which was to preserve their land rights, land use, and traditional customs. The special status and rights of the minority indigenous people of Hong Kong are extant to this day. The battle resulted in two wounded on the British side and about 500 dead on the Chinese side. Background The proclamation of the New Territories of Hong Kong by Colonial Secretary James Stewart Lockhart. On 9 June 1898, the British and the Qing government signed the Second Convention of Peking, granting the British a 99-year lease of the New Territories as part of Hong Kong. Feeling abandoned by the Qing government and fearing for their traditional land rights and land use, the punti Chinese clans mobilised the clan militias which had been trained and equipped to defend against longshore raids by pirates and attempted to resist the British takeover of the territory. Events The war began on 14 April when the insurgents burnt down the masthead the British had prepared for a flag-raising ceremony at the Flagstaff Hill in Tai Po. 125 Indian soldiers of the Royal Hong Kong RegimentDisbanded in 1902, this regiment is not to be confused with the later Royal Hong Kong Regiment formed from the body of the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps consisting primarily of Europeans and Chinese. were sent to Tai Po on 15 April and were soon besieged by the villagers. They were rescued after the Royal Navy's HMS Fame shelled the insurgents' position. On 17 April, the British forces launched an attack on the insurgents in Lam Tsuen Valley and chased them up the hill. On 18 April, about 1,600 insurgents assaulted the British troops at Sheung Tsuen but were soon defeated. Further resistance was ended when British artillery was brought up against the punti walled villages, and the insurgents and villagers surrendered on 19 April. Most prominent of the villages in the resistance Kat Hing Wai, of the Tang clan, was symbolically disarmed, by having its main gates dismounted and removed. Aftermath After the war, Governor Henry Arthur Blake adopted an amiable co-operation policy with the villagers and it remained the official policy of the colonial government on the New Territories throughout almost the entire British rule. The British made the concession of allowing the indigenous inhabitants to retain traditional laws and customs to land inheritance, land usage and marriage, these differed from the laws made for Kowloon and Hong Kong proper and the legacy of which continues to this day.

It is reported, that the short, skillful and very speedy attacker commenced his career in 1945 at the lowly Club Sportivo Patria in his hometown. Several years later the Paraguayan national team coach Manuel Fleitas Solich helped him to get contracted with Club Libertad in the capital Asunci√≥n. In 1951, he returned to Argentina to play for the top club CA River Plate in Buenos Aires, where he had little success competing with players like Angel Labruna, Felix Loustau and Walter Gomez for an attacker position.Plantel de River - 1951 , El feo Labruna (per 2 April 2014). Thus, in 1952 he took the opportunity to play again for Libertad. After competing without much success in the Copa Rio of 1952 Libertad went on to become runner-up in the national championship. In 1953 Libertad became again runner up in the championship, and players from the club made up the majority of the Paraguayan national team that in the same year won for the first time the South American Championship.The image on the stamp does not actually depict the championship winning team of 1955, but rather a side of Libertad from 1952 or 1953, which was runner up in the championship.

In 1954, Mart√≠n Alarc√≥n moved to Brazil, where he joined America FC in Rio de Janeiro, coached by Martim Francisco, who is credited with introducing the 4-2-4-system in Brazil. Alongside players like Can√°rio, who would later transfer to Real Madrid, and Manoel Pereira ‚Äì known as Le√¥nidas da Selva, or \\"Jungle Le√¥nidas\\", due to his \\"raw\\" skills and resemblance to Le√¥nidas da Silva ‚Äì , Alarc√≥n was 1954 and 1955 Championship of Rio de Janeiro runner-up, on both occasions losing the title to CR Flamengo. In a best-of-three series for the 1955 title, America lost the first match to Flamengo 0‚Äì1 and won the second one 5‚Äì1. In the decisive match on 6 April 1956 at Maracan√£ Stadium, before almost 140,000 spectators, a record crowd for America, Alarc√≥n had to leave the field early in the first half after a tackle by Flamengo defender Tomires. Substitutions were not allowed then and the balance of the match swung to Flamengo, coached by Fleitas Solich, who eventually won 4‚Äì1 thus attaining its third consecutive title. Alarc√≥n, who is sometimes considered the top player of this era of America FC, had two more good years with the club in 1956 and 1957, in the latter year scoring 14 goals in the Rio-Championship, his highest tally ever. However, America had to make do with the 5th and 6th places. From mid-1958 forward Alarc√≥n only received little if any playing time. Eventually, early 1960, the year when America would win its seventh and hitherto last Rio- Championship, Alarc√≥n left the club.

Their style is best described as mestizo, a mix of salsa, Latin, ska, Balkan and punk.  Origins  The band was founded in 1993 by singer and accordionist Piet Maris. During his first contacts with a Romani community in Slovakia in 1994 he learned the gipsy playing style and the typical Romani music repertoire. Jaune Toujours was inspired by this repertoire and completed their style with influences from salsa, Latin, reggae, ska, rock, punk and groove. They proclaim their world views with the energy of a rock band (without guitars), the improvisation of a jazz combo, the open-mindedness of a world music band and the vibe of a busker.  History  After a few line-up changes in the early years in June 1997 the band was completed with drummer Th√©ophane Raballand and trumpeter Bart Maris. A year later they recorded their first EP 'O'. In June 1999 they decided to start their own artist collective. From then on they organized their own management and label as 'Choux de Bruxelles'. All projects within Choux de Bruxelles attach great importance to multiculturalism. The first full-album 'Brusk' was recorded in 2000. In the same year they played the Global Activist Festival during the Euro summit in Brussels together with Ojos de Brujo and Babylon Circus. In 2002 a second full-album titled 'Camping del Mundo' was released. After this release they played their first international concerts. In the following years they were support act for Manu Chao and Radio Bemba Sound System and represented Belgium at the EBU festival in Norway. The release of the third full-album 'Barricade' in 2004 got them new international concerts and live radio performances for BBC Three and Funkhaus Europe. The 2006 live album 'cluB' brought them international recognition. In the UK they played at WOMAD, the Cambridge Folk Festival and in the BBC Three studios. Furthermore they performed on Tanzfest Rudolstadt and Popdeurope Berlin in Germany and The Paradiso Amsterdam, Oerol Terschellingen and Fiesta Mundial Tilburg in the Netherlands. Overseas they toured the west coast of Canada with shows on Vancouver Island, Fort McLeod (cfr. Brokeback Mountain) and Calgary. In Belgium they performed at Couleur Caf√©, Francofollies, Dranouter, Esperanzah!, Blue Note and Pol√© Pol√©. In April 2009 their fifth full-album 'KOLEKTIV' was released. In October of the same year they played a showcase for a selection of professionals on Womex in Copenhagen. In 2010 thousands of people across 12 different cities danced to the song 'Ici Bxl' to celebrate the Belgian EU presidency. The album 'Re:Plugged' was released in the same year. It features remixes of songs by Jaune Toujours and Mec Yek. In 2011 and 2012 Jaune Toujours cooperated with the Gangb√© Brass Band of Benin. Together they released the EP 'Afrobelbeat' and toured throughout Belgium and Benin. In 2013 the studio album 'Routes' came out. This album was internationally well received with reviews in among others The Guardianhttps://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/21/jaune- toujours-routes-review and The Independent, Songlines (magazine),fRoots and Westzeit. They have not been silent since the release of ROUTES (2013). In 2014 they worked with touareg musicians in Burkina Faso and they were invited for live sessions at BBC Radiohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DzDZp7Gjjc. In 2015 they recorded the album 'SuperDiverCity' with their gypsy alter ego Mec Yek. In 2016 Jaune Toujours celebrated its (more or less) twentieth anniversary with the collector‚Äôs box and album Jaune Toujours 20sth. And in 2017, frontman Piet Maris released the album 'Entity' on the Choux de Bruxelles label with Qotob Trio, a new project with compositions from the Belgo-Syrian cellist Bassel Abou Fakher, to then start working full force directly after that on the new studio album 'Europeana' that was released in the autumn of 2018.
