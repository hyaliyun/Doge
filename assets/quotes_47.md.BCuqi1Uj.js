Early life Archila was born in Colombia. At the age of 17, Archila came from Colombia to the United States. She worked in community organizing roles in New York. After obtaining her bachelor's degree, she became a staff member of the Latin American Integration Center (LAIC) in Queens, New York. The founding director of LAIC, Samaria Archila, was a former human rights lawyer from Colombia and her aunt. Career =Latin American Integration Center = After Samaria Archila died from cancer, Ana Maria Archila became the director of LAIC. She served in this role in 2003, where she spoke to the media about the Latino population in New York state. She worked as executive director of LAIC in 2003 working out of their offices in Port Richmond, Staten Island. Archila advocated on behalf of parents with limited English language skills in Staten Island and Queens, New York, to obtain more information about their children's education. She subsequently worked on immigration issues with the organization Make the Road New York . She took MRNY from its beginnings to become the biggest group in New York City supporting initiatives on behalf of local communities. =Center for Popular Democracy= In her role as co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy (CPD), Archila spoke out in 2018 against the immigration policies of US President Donald Trump. Archila told CNN that removing children from their parents and their family would cause damage that would be difficult to repair later in life. She supported a reformation of the immigration process in the United States. In June 2018, Archila lamented that the zero tolerance policy of the Trump Administration which separated immigrant children from their parents, was still in operation. Archila brought attention to Puerto Rico and problems of lack of power after Hurricane Maria. Archila warned that Puerto Rico was lacking in proper governmental organization in advance of the following hurricane season. She advocated for debt relief to alleviate economic problems in Puerto Rico. Archila pointed in particular to Bank of Santander as an example of economic debt pressures on Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria. Archila said Puerto Rico was not getting responsive assistance from the US federal government, because the United States Congress did not view the locality as within their representation duties. U.S. Senate hearings on Supreme Court nomination On September 28, 2018, US Senator Jeff Flake announced his intention to vote for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh had been accused of sexual assault by a number of women, including Christine Blasey Ford, who testified for several hours before the Senate Judiciary Committee the day before Flake's announcement. Kavanaugh subsequently testified and denied the allegations. Flake said that Ford's testimony was \\"compelling\\", but added that Kavanaugh's response was \\"persuasive\\" and left him \\"with as much doubt as certainty\\" regarding what had occurred. Following his announcement, Flake was confronted by Archila along with Maria Gallagher, two anti-Kavanaugh protestors, in a Senate office building elevator. On the same day, Flake voted not to subpoena Mark Judge to appear before the Judiciary Committee, who Ford said was present during her sexual assault. That afternoon, Flake voted to advance Kavanaugh's nomination out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said he was a \\"yes\\" vote \\"only if the final Senate vote [was] delayed for one week, during which time the FBI [could] investigate sexual harassment allegations against Kavanaugh\\"; Senate Republican leaders agreed to support the proposed investigation. Later that day, President Trump directed the FBI to undertake a one-week investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh. Joseph R.

Biography  Albert-Louis Van Houtte, 1919 Van Houtte was born in 1877, in Tourcoing, France, then emigrated to Canada in 1912. After the First World War, he attempted a horse importing business, before switching to food retailing. He married Marie-Louise Deherripon and had three children: Christophe Van Houtte, Pierre Van Houtte and Lucy Van Houtte. On December 18, 1919, he took ownership of Camille Hussenot's import shop from Camille Hussenot. The shop was at 321 Ontario Street East in Montreal. The shop sold water, olive oil, foie gras, tea, coffee makers, soaps, wine and coffee. He also imported other products from Europe, such as cookies and chocolate, SEB kitchen utensils, Creuset cookware and Dessault wine vinegar. The products drew in more customers to the business. He was known for providing very personalized service to customers. In 1919, Albert-Louis decided that his brewer could not roast a green coffee that was dark enough and so, partly because he loved coffee beans, decided to buy a coffee roaster, and he started to brew his own coffee to sell in his shop. He found particular success with gourmet coffee roasting. In the 1930s, he opened a second store in Quebec. On April 2, 1944, he died at the age of 67 because of frail health and was entombed at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal. He left his company to his three children.

Subdivision and construction  In York, in 1885, part of Avon Locations X and Y on the south side of South Street and owned by merchant John Henry Monger Jnr was subdivided.DLI subdivision survey plan 63, 9 October 1885. Location Y was traversed by the Eastern Railway line, then under construction, and the York station yard was located within the new subdivision. Already on the land was the Sisters of Mercy convent and school, on South Street, and the York Mechanic‚Äôs Institute on Avon Terrace (where the Town Hall is now situated). James Grave and Edward Keane acquired Lots 12 and 13 on the corner of Avon Terrace and Joaquina Street, which led directly to the railway station. Grave was an investor in the railway line extension to York. On 18 December 1885, Grave, Keane, William Mumme and Frederick Monger obtained a ¬£4,000 mortgage from the Bank of New South Wales, presumably to pay for part of the cost of construction of the hotel.Certificates of Title, Vol. 2 Fol. 251 & Vol. 16 Fol. 22, 22 October 1885 & 18 December 1885. Frederick Monger was the son of John Henry Monger Jnr, and Mumme was a major partner in the Swan Brewery and owned a small brewery in York.Welborn, Suzanne, Swan: The history of a brewery, UWA Press, Perth, 1987, pp. 39-45; Spiller, Geoff, Micro-Breweries to Monopoly and Back: Swan River Colony breweries 1829-2002, WA Museum, Perth, 2003, pp. 176-178. The hotel was under construction in November 1885.Eastern District Chronicle, 21 November 1885, p. 2. No tenders for the construction have been located.The architect is not known, though given the involvement of James William Wright in the railway line extension, and the fact that he was the only consulting architect in Perth at the time, it could be him. The contractors were A. J. Castledine and A. B. Wright, and the work was supervised by Castledine.Western Mail, 17 July 1886, p. 21. Local history has D. Gallop as the builder (York heritage trail booklet). No reference to him has been located in researched sources, but he could have been working for Castledine & Wright.  Opening  On 29 May 1886, Frederick Thomas Pamment advertised his intention of applying for a Publican‚Äôs General Licence for the hotel. The place was described at that time as containing thirteen bedrooms and four sitting rooms, exclusive of those required by the family. The licence application notice revealed that Pamment was leasing the hotel from Keane, Monger, Grave and Mumme.Eastern Districts Chronicle, 29 May 1886, p. 2. A report on the hotel appeared in the Western Mail in July:York Notes dated 5 July published in the Western Mail, 17 July 1886, p. 21. The hotel was opened on 8 July 1886, but the event received only a brief sentence in the local newspaper with the comment that the place \\"seems to be favoured with a fair share of public patronage\\".The Eastern District Chronicle, 10 July 1886, p. 2. An advertisement that appeared in the Western Mail in October 1886, describes the hotel as having private dining rooms, special suites of rooms, sample rooms for commercial travellers, plunge and shower baths, a splendid billiard room fitted with one of Alcock‚Äôs best tables, and good stabling and loose boxes with an attentive ostler in attendance. The second class accommodation mentioned in the earlier description was also referred to.Western Mail, 30 October 1886, p. 9.  Fire  On 10 February 1894, around midnight, a fire broke out in a group of shops in a galvanised iron building immediately adjoining the Imperial Hotel to the north. These shops had been there since at least 1889. Horley‚Äôs Auction Mart: Eastern Districts Chronicle, 16 November 1889, p.4. The shops were Hillman & Co‚Äôs furniture and upholstery warehouse where the fire started, and north, Mr Lewis‚Äôs tailoring and fabrics establishment. A crowd of several hundred gathered and were unable to do anything about the shops but were able to prevent the fire from burning down the Imperial Hotel. The flames broke through a window into one of the bedrooms but ‚Äúthey were successfully combated‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe billiard room below would appear to have suffered to a greater extent the walls being damaged together with a number of billiard cues, balls etc. Fortunately the wind was blowing the flames away from the hotel otherwise the main building would have suffered to an alarming extent. Furniture was removed out into the street, the spirit room emptied, while horses and vehicles were taken from the stables and placed in safety away from the premises.‚Äù Eastern Districts Chronicle, 17 February 1894, p.6.  Charles Playter  Charles Playter normally lived in North Fremantle but was a lodger at the Imperial Hotel in February 1898. He was at the time working as a draughtsman with the Railways Department. At his home in North Fremantle, on a hot night, Playter was used to stepping out through his window onto the verandah so he could breathe the cool air. This night at the Imperial Hotel, it was very hot, so Playter stepped out through the window to discover that there was no verandah and no balcony. He fell to the ground and suffered serious injuries. Next morning, Playter was found on the ground outside the hotel in some pain. He died a few hours later.Western Mail, 11 February 1898, p.62.  Subsequent history  Following its construction, the hotel would have benefited from its proximity to the York railway station, as the major Western Australian port at the time was Albany and all traffic passed through York. The hotel would also have been well patronised during the early gold rush years, when people rushing to the goldfields left the train at York and then travelled the rest of the way on foot. This passing trade would have reduced considerably in the mid 1890s when the railway line was continued through to Southern Cross.Documentary Evidence in Heritage Conservation Plan by Laura Gray, 2018. In 1892, the Swan Brewery Company took over Mumme's interest in the hotel and in 1901 acquired the whole title. From 1 January 1898, the hotel was leased to Laurence Philip Bowes, and after Bowes' death, the lease was transferred to Charles Tyler Pyke in August 1902. A year later, Pyke acquired title.Documentary Evidence in Heritage Conservation Plan by Laura Gray, 2018; Certificate of Title Volume 16 Folio 22 and Volume 212 Folio 26. A single-storey building adjoining the Imperial Hotel, York on the Avon Terrace frontage is shown in a photograph of the town. This is almost certainly the music hall, and offers an explanation as to why the hotel building did not utilise the full street frontage.Photo, York c.1900, courtesy Residency Museum, York. The music hall was removed in the 1910.Documentary Evidence in Heritage Conservation Plan by Laura Gray, 2018. Since the early 20th century, ownership of the hotel has changed many times. In 1920, a single story stone kitchen was added and a larger public bar was installed in the area where the kitchen and dining room had been, with the dining room being relocated to the area of the original small bars, under which was a cellar. From 1933, the second class lodgers accommodation was used as staff quarters.Documentary Evidence in Heritage Conservation Plan by Laura Gray, 2018. The 1968 Meckering earthquake damaged the hotel and many other buildings in the district. The two-storey, bull nose verandah had to be removed and the condition of the building declined. In 1981, the place was closed as unfit for human habitation and became subject to vandalism and weather deterioration. After some renovations, in 1987, the hotel was acquired by York Motels Pty Ltd (1987-1993) including local builder David Ayoub. He rebuilt the verandahs, using wrought iron work manufactured in Sydney to match the originals, but the fretwork arches on the lower level and the bullnose verandah roof were not reproduced.A photograph showing the original verandahs is reproduced in Ball, J., Kelsall, D. & Pidgeon, J., Statewide Survey of Hotels 1829-1939, southern region, Western Australia, National Trust of Australia (WA), Perth, 1997, entry H3. In the early 2000s, a fire in the stables destroyed the timberwork of the building, including the roof timbers. Material that wasn‚Äôt destroyed, including the hewn timber horse troughs, was removed leaving only the stone walls standing. The hotel was renovated in about 2010 and again by a local farming syndicate in 2018 and has reopened, providing meals and refreshments.

It is undergoing restoration after the Planning Commission had approved the works to start on this historic building. History The Tat- Tmien Kantunieri Windmill was commissioned by Grand Master Ramon Perellos y Roccaful and started operating in 1710 by the miller Ganni Scicluna (Gio Maris Xicluna). Perellos has also made Giovanni Gourgion as the Procurator of Wheat, where Giovanni would receive a commission on all grain he brought to Malta. Gourgion has his residence, which later used to be known as the Gourgion Tower in Xewkija. The Windmill with Gozo Citadel in background The windmill consists of a large entrance hall with two parallel rooms. At the back of the mill, there is a kitchen and building still retain its original oven. In the middle of the mill, there is a winding staircase leading to the mill roof. Above the entrance hall, there is the birth room. The windmill remained in use until 1886 as a fire destroyed it. Later in the mid of the 19th century, it was owned by the three Camilleri brothers. The windmill served as the first location for the Xewkija Band Club ‚Äì Banda Prekursur. It was used as the base of this club from 1956 to 1965. Currently the windmill is being restored. Some concrete elements that were added later during the years will be removed, and a small square nearby will be added. The mechanical parts will also be re- installed. About =The Miller= The miller would grind cereals and grains, with the help of a big rotating stone driven from the eight pointed fan like sails made from wood. When the wind blows from the required direction, the miller would call his customers by a trumpet shell (), or otherwise he would also go with his cart to collect the grains. Before this type of mill has been built, the miller had to use a blindfolded mule or ass to turn a similar stone setup, usually in a stable. These mills are considered the first industrial machines on the Maltese islands. An interesting notary note dated 7th March 1851 was unearthed recently (2018). The note was made by Marcello Xicluna the leaseholder of the Windmill. He argued that in order to pay for the rent he had to sell various possessions he had. He asked for a reduction of his rent which was 550 scudi per annum. He had this lease from the government for the last 32 years. During that time people were constructing their 'centimolo' into their own property and thus they were milling their own corn, and were not making use of his mill. He brought other arguments too. The request was at the end refused. =Maltese windmills= Malta has the biggest density of windmills in the world, which is 1 windmill every 9sq km. This surpasses the Netherlands, which has 1 windmill every 39sq km. In the Maltese Islands, 69 windmills are known to have been built, but only about 36 still exist today. 54 windmills were built in Malta and 15 in Gozo. Only 3 windmills have sails to date. Most windmills in Malta were built by the Knights of St. John after they came from Rhodes. In 1674, the Grand Master Nicolas Cotoner ordered the building of the first five mills, with other building orders followed after. The construction period for these windmills was between 1663 till 1773. The windmill builders were assisted by the experts brought up from Mallorca, Spain. Some windmills were also used for the production of gunpowder. In 1838, the government ended the monopoly of windmills, thus everybody was allowed to build windmills. The windmills were later superseded by steam mills.

History  The development of Rockhampton commenced in the 1850s with the Archer brothers Charles and William who established a pastoral run \\"Gracemere\\" station with a few thousand sheep, 10 km north of the present city centre. Provisions for the property were brought in via the Fitzroy River to the furthest point that ships could navigate and that point gave rise to a small settlement on the banks of the river, Rockhampton. Gold was discovered 70 km north of Rockhampton at Canoona Station in 1858, rapidly followed by the arrival of thousands of people. The rush was short lived but people stayed on and the town of Rockhampton developed. The town was laid out in 1858 with the main street one street back from the river to allow for port activity to concentrate at the river and the town declared a port with a customs reserve.Allom Lovell 2000, 8 Gold mining had commenced at Mount Morgan in 1882 (32 km south west of Rockhampton) when Fred Morgan and his five brothers pegged a claim at Ironstone Mountain. Mining at Mount Morgan in 1882 was originally to recover gold, but considerable quantities of silver and copper were also discovered. The Morgans had sold all shares in the Mount Morgan Mine by 1886 to the remaining partners of the original syndicate, Thomas Skarrat Hall, William Knox D'arcy and William Pattison. The Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company Ltd was floated in 1886 with eight trustees owning one million one pound shares. The Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company Ltd controlled the mining leases between 1886 and 1927. The company went into liquidation in 1927 following a disastrous underground fire and deliberate flooding of the workings in 1925. The company was reformed as Mount Morgan Limited (MML) in 1928. MML began open cut mining in 1932 and by the time mining ceased in 1981 more than 145 megatonnes of ore and overburden had been handled. During the 108-year life of the mine approximately 262 tonnes of gold, 37 tonnes of silver and 387,000 tonnes of copper were mined from Mount Morgan from underground and open cut operations. The mine closed in 1990. The former Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company office in Quay Street was erected in 1897 for the trustees of the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company. The rendered masonry building is an outstanding component of the 19th century character of Quay Street and was a direct manifestation of the wealth which Mount Morgan gold brought to Rockhampton. Quay Street was the centre of trade for Central Queensland and operated as a port city with its magnificent Customs House until the 1950s when the port was closed. By 1882 it was connected to Baracaldine and as a result the wealth from the central west grazing was funnelled through the port. Rockhampton was also a centre for brewery, meatworks and other industries. The gold boom of the Mount Morgan mine added additional wealth to the city and stimulated the building and rebuilding of the Quay Street architecture. The site for the company office was acquired by the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company in August 1896, ten years after the floating of the company in 1886. The Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company building was constructed in 1897 as the headquarters of the company and was used for board meetings as well as for the storage of gold awaiting shipment from the river wharves across from Quay Street. The building was positioned near the other principal business premises of Rockhampton, which had developed along Quay Street to serve the passing trade at the wharves.Allom Lovell 2000,11-12 Along with the Mining Company building, a range of buildings were constructed in Quay Street consisting of Mount Morgan Gold Mining company building, the Rockhampton Club, the Commercial and Criterion Hotel and the Rockhampton Harbour Board Building. In 1913, the Mining Company building was leased to the New Zealand Loan & Mercantile Company from who later purchased the building in 1920. 4RK control room equipment, 1931 In June 1963 the Australian Government purchased the building for use as television station for the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC). Tenders were called for the conversion of the building by the Commonwealth Department of Works in July 1963. The conversion plans included provisions for sound proofing and air-conditioning in some parts as well as a video-tape room, telecine room, control room, studio, news room, general offices, technician's room, a film dispatch room and a facilities room. The ABC occupied the former Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company offices as well as the building adjacent on the southern side and connected the two via a temporary garage structure. The establishment of the studio cost ¬£500,000. Radio broadcasting commenced in the region in 1931 as the commercial station 4RK but became part of the ABC in 1932 known as ABC Capricornia. The studios broadcasts local and networked programs 24 hours a day and is active in community and industry events in the region. It is the base for a television reports and camera operator/editor. It is one of the most technologically up to date regional studios in the country. The building originally had a central courtyard, which has been roofed over, and numerous internal cedar doors, which are no longer extant. The front elevation of the building is substantially intact and still displays its original lead lighting and etched glass. The building continues to function as an ABC radio station.  Description  ABC Radio Studios is at 236 Quay Street, Rockhampton, being Lot 257on R1675, Parish of Rockhampton, County of Livingstone. The former Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company building, a single-storeyed rendered masonry structure whose roof is concealed behind a parapet, is located fronting Quay Street overlooking the Fitzroy River to the northeast. The building has access from Quay Lane at the rear. Signage on the pediment, 2017 The symmetrical Quay Street elevation comprises five arches, which form an arcade with a central entrance, surmounted by a deep entablature with a moulded balustrade parapet with pedestals crowned by moulded ornaments. The central entrance is flanked by pilasters, which have fluting to the lower section of the shaft, supporting a triangular pediment surmounted by a moulded ornament at the apex. The pediment and cornice have egg and dart mouldings, the architrave has dentils, and the pilasters surmount tall pedestals, which flank entrance steps with low wrought iron gates. The arches have expressed imposts, extrados and keystones, and are surmounted by a frieze with moulded swags. The paired arches either side of the entrance have a central granite column with an Ionic capital, surmounting a tall pedestal flanked by a moulded balustrade. The arcade has pilasters at either end, above which flagpoles are mounted behind the parapet. The Quay Street elevation detailing runs the width of the arcade either end of the building. The building has paired wrought iron gates on the southern side for vehicle access, and a single wrought iron gate on the northern side.ABC Radio Studios entrance arcade, 2017 The arcade has paired timber-panelled entrance doors with sidelights and an arched fanlight containing etched glass and leadlight panels. The entrance is flanked by two casement windows with arched headers to either side, all of which have expressed imposts, extrados and keystones. The arcade has arches at either end, with two cross arches framing the entrance. The floor of the arcade has diagonally-laid black-and- white marble tiles, the ceiling is boarded, and the rendered wall is scribed to imitate coursing. A garage structure has been constructed on the southern side, setback from the street, infilling the space between this and the adjacent building. The original arched header sash windows opening to the southern side have been bricked-up. The northern side of the building is finished in painted brickwork, with sash windows with security bars and high- level fanlight panels. The rear of the building appears to consist of an early section constructed along Quay Lane, with a courtyard space between the main building which has been roofed over. An opening at the southern end has also been infilled with brickwork. The rear wall is painted brickwork, with a series of arched header windows and a central entrance door. Internally, the building has a central corridor with rooms opening to either side. The building has a suspended ceiling throughout, and most of the rendered masonry walls have been lined with compressed sheeting for either decorative or soundproofing purposes. A reception area with partitioned offices is located at the front of the building, behind which is the former strongroom which has been converted into a radio studio. Three large rooms along the southern side of the building have been converted into television studios and editing rooms. Much of the original detailing has been obscured by later alterations to the building, but some panelled timber doors survive, as do architraves and window sills. The rear television studio has a rendered dado and skirtings, and perforated wall sheeting frames the arched header sash windows. The rear section of the building has a lower floor level than the front section, and comprises studios, equipment and storage rooms, with staff facilities at the rear fronting Quay Lane. The roof in the rear supports a satellite dish. = Condition = In 1998 the place was inspected and that maintenance works were completed that enhanced the heritage values. As at 2006, the interior was extensively altered, though the exterior is currently well maintained.  Heritage listing  ABC Radio Studios was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 14 September 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes The building, constructed in 1897, as an administration office for the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company, has a strong link to the period when the Mount Morgan Mine was the richest gold mine in the world, and stimulated an economic boom in Rockhampton. Criterion D: Characteristic values Although modest in scale, the building is an example of the Federation Academic Classical style well expressed in the classical proportions of the arcaded verandah, the use of arched bays with granite columns and decorated Ionic pilasters and the parapet concealing the roof. The ABC Studio Building is an integral unit of the stylistic expression of the streetscape. The building retains its original fabric and form in the gable roofs and internal layout of central corridor. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics The ABC Studio is an important visual aesthetic contributor to the Quay Street streetscape. Its aesthetic characteristics are its scale, form and stylistic design that create an attractive image that is in harmony with the adjacent streetscape buildings. It is the centre piece of a group of three single storey buildings of classical style. The front fa√ßade exhibits a high degree of detail in finishes and craftsmanship that contribute to the designed aesthetic characteristics of the place and the streetscape. It is a strong contributor to image of the historic city of Rockhampton, particularly the 19th Century Quay Street streetscape. The aesthetic characteristics are the ornate character of the period fa√ßade, the harmony of the building with its neighbours and within the streetscape due to the physical expression of its historic style, its form and its scale. These characteristics are well recognised and documented by the community as reflected in the 1976 report by the National Trust of Australia. The value is appreciated by the local community as reflected in the listing by the National Trust and the local government.

Introduced in the first episode of Series 11, Ryan is a current companion of Jodie Whittaker's Thirteenth Doctor.  Character biography  = Early life = Ryan Sinclair was born in 1999 or late 1998. As a child, he attended Redlands Primary alongside Yasmin Khan and was placed in a class named after Rosa Parks. In 2012, when he was thirteen, his mother died from a heart attack, with Ryan being the one to find her body. After his mother's death, Ryan's relationship with his father soured to the point of parental abandonment. He began to feel that he wasn't deserving of his father's love. Ryan was then raised by his paternal grandmother, Grace. = Young adult life = Ryan suffered the effects of racism and noted that he was stopped more often by the police than his white peers. Ryan once went on a messy holiday to Crete with his mates. Ryan worked in a warehouse for SportStack, with one of his main jobs being packing trainers for delivery. Due to his dyspraxia, Ryan's first month on the job was a \\"total nightmare\\" for him, as he struggled to do things physically. Fortunately, he found friends who helped him, and he was able to master his way around the packing area. At one point while on the job, Ryan rode the warehouse conveyor belt, leading to him getting a sprained ankle, and a \\"final warning\\" from his superiors. In 2015, Grace married Graham O'Brien. Despite her wishes that Ryan consider Graham his granddad, he did not accept Grace's husband as family. In 2017, Ryan was visited by his father, but the encounter ended poorly after Ryan \\"got mad\\" at his father for constantly missing out on his life. = Meeting the Doctor = In September 2018, whilst trying to learn to cycle with Grace and Graham, Ryan fell off and threw the bicycle away into the nearby woods out of anger. After his grandmother and Graham left him to calm down, Ryan went to retrieve it. Whilst retrieving it from a tree, he discovered a glowing symbol and, upon touching it, summoned a strange blue pod. He touched the pod only to find it freezing, burning his hand. Calling the police to investigate, Ryan was reunited with Yasmin Khan, a classmate from school who now worked as a police officer, when she arrived to investigate the scene. Ryan confessed it wasn't a prank, making Yasmin confirm such by touching the pod. Walking away, Ryan received a call from his grandmother asking for help on a nearby train. The pair raced to the train, where they met the recently regenerated Thirteenth Doctor and were subsequently electrocuted by a coil creature. Ryan helped the Doctor track down the pod's occupant, Tim Shaw and prevented him from claiming Karl Wright as a trophy. However, Grace died via electrocution when disabling the gathering coil. Devastated, her death motivated Ryan to battle his dyspraxia in her honour. He later helped the Doctor make a teleport so she could reach her TARDIS only to be teleported with her into space. Believing the pair to be bonuses in the Rally of the Twelve Galaxies, Angstrom scooped Ryan and Graham out of deep space and transported them aboard her ship. On Desolation, he found Yasmin and the Doctor, who had been similarly saved by Epzo, Angstrom's rival in what would become the final stage of the rally. The rivals, with the Doctor and her friends in tow, were tasked by Ilin, master of the rally, to race across the planet; the first to reach the finish line at the Ghost Monument would win 3.2 million krin and salvation from planet's hostile surface. The Doctor discovered that the Ghost Monument was, in fact, her TARDIS, phasing in and out of reality. After the Doctor stabilised the TARDIS, Ryan entered it for the first time and the Doctor attempted to take them home. = Trying to return home = Attempting to land the TARDIS back in 21st century Sheffield, Ryan saw singing waterfalls made of pink crystals, a unicorn sanctuary on a lost moon and the Big Bang happening in front of his eyes. Eventually, the TARDIS had latched onto nearby Artron energy and landed in 1955 Montgomery, Alabama, exciting Ryan as it was his first time travel experience. However, when he tried to return a dropped glove to a passerby, Lizzie, he was slapped by her husband who threatened to lynch him should he disturb a white woman in Montgomery. After Rosa Parks helped to calm the man, she explained to Ryan that outsiders were not safe from racism in segregated US states and told him of the death of the northern Emmett Till in Mississippi. Later, Ryan was denied service at Slim's Bar and labelled a \\"negro\\", and had to discretely enter the \\"whites-only\\" Sahara Springs Motel. He had to enter through the back door of the buses and sit at the back. To learn more about Rosa, given he only knew about her defiant move which started the Montgomery Bus Boycott led by Martin Luther King, he followed her home and sat in on one of her annual meetings with other blacks campaigning for civil rights. There, he met King, astonishing him and explained how his grandmother Grace idolised the preacher. Attempting to stop Krasko's plot to alter history, Ryan and Graham came to James Blake's fishing spot. Blake was shocked that the black Ryan was Graham's grandson and was told by Ryan of a staged event by black citizens in Montgomery that night, causing Blake to resume his place in history as the driver of Parks's bus. Later, he boarded Parks's bus to ensure it was crowded enough for whites to not be able to all sit at the front. He witnessed Parks refusing to move for the white passengers and her historic arrest. Back at the TARDIS, the Doctor told Ryan that Parks was honoured by President Clinton in 1999, which Ryan thought took too long. He was taken to see Asteroid 284996, also named Rosaparks, in space. The Doctor managed to finally return Ryan and his friends home to Sheffield, only half an hour after they left, and before the Doctor could leave on her own, she and Ryan visited Yaz's flat for tea. Discovering a mysteriously quiet nearby flat that was infested with cobwebs, the arachnophobic Ryan discovered that giant spiders had begun attacking humans around Sheffield. Eventually, the source of the spiders was traced to the new hotel built by Jack Robertson that Yaz's mother, Najia Khan, was working at. As Ryan was forced to capture one of the smaller spiders, it was revealed that the hotel was built on the site of a former coal mine that was pumped up with toxic waste, causing the local spiders to mutate and grow much larger than normal. Ryan received a letter from his father asking to reconnect with him, but he did not approve and did not have enough time to process it before stumbling upon a large van-sized spider in the hotel's ballroom. Coming up with a plan, Ryan connected the entertainment system in Robertson's panic room to a grime music station and used the vibrations to lure the smallest ones in and trap them. However, Robertson shot the largest mother spider despite the Doctor's protests not to. With the threat over, Ryan, Graham and Yaz met up outside the TARDIS and, after being allowed in, stated their intentions to willingly carry on travelling with the Doctor. With her christening their group as 'Team TARDIS', they all pulled a lever together to continue to further adventures. = Adventures with the Doctor = Ryan and Team TARDIS travelled to the planet Gatan, arriving in the City of Radiant Stone in the midst of war. Ryan decided to climb to the roofs of the city to see what was causing the destruction, where he and Graham witnessed a robotic woman called Sandola Dell fly past and begin to commentate on the battle between Tumat and Kraytos. When he was spotted by Sandola, he attempted to argue with her, leading to him and Graham being teleported to her headquarters at the Freedom Thoughtcasting Network. After being briefly reunited with the Doctor on board, Ryan and Graham were locked up by Sandola in a disused dressing room. Learning of her struggles at work, the two convinced her to take some time off, leaving them alone. Learning they were in the room belonging to two actors who played Tumat and Kraytos for promotions, they used the powerful suits to break out and rescue the Doctor from being attacked by Berakka Dogbolter. They eventually used the suits to trick the real warriors onto a teleport pad where the Doctor fused them into one being, thereby ending the war. When Team TARDIS travelled to the junk planet Seffilun 27 in search of spare parts in the 67th century, Graham accidentally set off a sonic mine that knocked them out for four days. Fortunately, the Tsuranga medical ship had been nearby when the mine detonated, and they were brought on board for treatment shortly after the blast, but without the TARDIS. As the Doctor found a way to get back, the ship was boarded by a Pting, which began to eat through the ship itself. Ryan and Yaz met Yoss, a man who was about to give birth, and felt his baby kicking before Ryan explained about his troubled history with his own father. With a plan forming, Ryan and Graham were forced to act as 'doulas' for Yoss and successfully delivered his baby. Safely arriving on the space station with the Pting jettisoned in the meantime, Ryan and his friends were able to return to the TARDIS. In New York City in 1904, Ryan saw the Doctor escape from 200 cyborg clones of Harry Houdini in the subway. The Doctor and her team were tasked with preventing the Genesis Seed stored in the secret Vault 13 within the Galactic Seed Vault from falling into the hands of Nightshade. Ryan and Team TARDIS later travelled to Punjab in 1947 on Yaz's request to see her grandmother Umbreen when she was younger. They eventually met Umbreen and her husband-to-be Prem on the day before both their wedding and the Partition of India, where Prem's younger brother, Manish, wanted to separate Hindus and Muslims on the nearby border. However, they encountered two Thijarians who they believed were killing local people. Ryan, the Doctor and Prem investigated and accidentally ended up in their 'hive'. However, after escaping and trapping the Thijarians out of the area, the Doctor realised that they were simply bearing witness to the unacknowledged dead, with Prem next. Ryan watched as Umbreen and Prem got married, but when Manish's Hindu nationalists attempted to drive the Muslims out, Prem was shot by Manish. Ryan and his friends eventually returned to 2018 with history unchanged by their visit. The Doctor's group next visited the Kerb!am warehouse on Kandoka's moon after the Doctor received a message for help on a packing slip she received. Ryan inspired the Doctor that they should take the roles of employees in the workforce, and he joined her in packing with Kira Arlo. After encountering the manager, Jarva Slade, Ryan, the Doctor and Yaz believed that the company's system had gone rogue and was making the small number of human workers vanish. However, when he discovered that Kira had gone missing, he led Yaz and their co-worker, Charlie Duffy, to the unmanned dispatch area via several conveyor belts. After Kira died at the hands of a delivery robot, it was revealed that Charlie had intercepted all the company's parcels and turned their bubble wrap into bombs to kill their receivers and pin the blame on the automated system to let humans get more jobs. With the Doctor preventing the deliveries from going out but Charlie refusing to leave, the group teleported out before the warehouse could explode. After attempting to arrive at Queen Elizabeth I's coronation, the Doctor accidentally brought Team TARDIS to Bilehurst Cragg in the early 17th century in the middle of a series of witch trials. After Mother Twiston was tried as a witch by the landlady, Becka Savage, the Doctor intervened, proclaiming her group to be witchfinders. Upon meeting King James I, the King took a shine to Ryan, and he and Graham were forced to stick with him and Becka. After Becka's younger cousin Willa was attacked by a tendril of mud while attempting to bury her grandmother, Ryan attempted to prevent them from killing anyone else while the Doctor and Yaz investigated, but the plan did not work, leading the group to encounter the others as the mud possessed the body of Mother Twiston. Moving off to find a group of the mud figures, Ryan, Graham and Yaz eventually stumbled upon the Doctor getting ducked under suspicion as a witch. Although she survived, Becka revealed herself to be infected with the mud and transformed, now identifying as the Morax, whose prison disguised as a tree on Pendle Hill was broken by Becka, leading them to plan on releasing their king and filling up the planet with their form. After being briefly knocked out, everyone followed the Doctor to Pendle Hill, where they used burning torches constructed from the prison to seal the Morax again. Eventually, the group made King James promise that the events would never be recounted in the future and, turning down an offer to follow King James home to London, Ryan left in the TARDIS. Team TARDIS next arrived at a pizza parlour in New Port City, where they discovered the body of Iz. Ryan and Yaz investigated Iz's home together. They discovered that the deceased Gornt was a brilliant artist, and found teleportation coordinates to a party Iz had attended outside the Grey Zone. Ryan and Yaz teleported to the party's location, but were instead kidnapped by Ronan Sumners, who planned to harvest their sperantium to power the city's teleportation system. However, they were saved by Graham and the Doctor, and Sumners was accidentally ported into a Pizza-Porter oven. After helping the Doctor halt a war on the planet Lobos between the dog-like loba and human colonists, Ryan left his mobile phone there and asked to return for it. Accidentally, the TARDIS slipped almost six hundred years into the future, where the planet was now ruled by human zealots, served by slave loba. The zealots derived human superiority over loba from one joke by Graham, now worshipped as \\"the Good Doctor\\" while the real Doctor was forgotten. With women treated barely better than loba, Ryan and Yasmin were conflated into \\"St Rasmin\\", which gave Ryan a considerable authority. He befriended Brother Tempika from the Temple of Tordos, who turned out to work for the resistance. This helped the Doctor learn both sides of the story. In the end, the Doctor succeeded in uncovering the lie of the zealots, setting the record straight and brokering a lasting peace between humans and loba. = Making peace with his family = Visiting 2018 Norway, the Doctor and friends discovered a strangely boarded-up and quiet cottage in the middle of nowhere. Exploring, they found a girl called Hanne hiding, terrified, as her father Erik had left her and she believed there was a monster in the nearby woods that took him. Despite not initially taking to each other well, Ryan was forced to stay with Hanne as the Doctor, Graham and Yaz entered some form of dimensional portal placed in a mirror upstairs in the house. Eventually, Ryan discovered there was no monster, just some recordings played to scare Hanne, and upon learning this, she escaped into the portal. They ended up in an anti-zone, an area made to protect space-time, while the rest of the group had already reached the other side. Escaping, Hanne discovered the Solitract plane, a conscious alternate universe that was exiled at the beginning of time as it was incompatible with the main universe and was now seeking friends, creating figures of Hanne's mother, Trine, and Grace to attract Erik and Graham. However, Ryan was trapped in the anti-zone as the Solitract plane collapsed and just about managed to escape with the rest of the group when they reappeared. After saying goodbye to Hanne, Graham explained how he had met Grace again, and he and Ryan talked about how they both missed her. Ryan finally called him 'Granddad' in doing so, before returning to the TARDIS. In the TARDIS, the Doctor discovered nine separate distress signals all coming from the planet Ranskoor Av Kolos, which they followed to meet a man called Greston Paltraki, a commander who had visited the planet to stop a threat there. They eventually discovered that he was being threatened by Tzim-Sha, the Stenza they met on their first adventure, over the safety of some strange mineral-shaped objects. Ryan and Graham were tasked with finding Paltraki's crew. Evading fire from SniperBots, Graham and Ryan discovered the rest of the crew held in Stenza stasis pods and attempted to get them out before they were attacked again. As Tzim-Sha put his plan of using the local Ux's powers with his technology to stasis freeze entire planets, starting with Earth, Ryan began to lead the hostages to safety. He returned just as Graham was being faced down by Tzim-Sha, and distracted him long enough for Graham to weaken him. After finally fist-bumping Graham, the two locked Tzim-Sha in one of his own stasis pods. With the threat averted, the Ux decided to see the universe with Paltraki and the Doctor's group headed on their way. Sometime later, Ryan and his friends were treated by the Doctor to witnessing nineteen New Year's Eve celebrations in a row from across history. Before reaching the twentieth, however, the Doctor was alerted to some non-terrestrial things attempting to come together in Sheffield. Landing at an archaeological dig site on New Year's Day 2019, Ryan met Lin and Mitch who had uncovered an ancient burial site when a massive squid-like creature briefly appeared. Trying to analyse the creature, Team TARDIS travelled to Graham's house where Ryan finally reunited with his father, Aaron. Ryan left to talk with him in a caf√© as the rest of the group returned to the TARDIS. Sat together, Ryan told his father exactly how lost and lonely he had been feeling ever since he left and how he had let him down and hidden when he was needed, although Aaron refused to hide any more. They eventually returned home and Ryan entered the parked TARDIS, discovering that the creature was, in fact, a reconnaissance scout Dalek that had taken control of Lin. Ryan joined the Doctor in tracking it down to a farm. The Dalek eventually let go of Lin and Ryan helped take her back to the TARDIS. After the Dalek rebuilt a casing for itself before meeting the Doctor and taking off to summon a fleet to Earth, the group picked up Graham and Aaron and went to corner the Dalek. They used a microwave owned by Aaron to melt its casing, but the Dalek escaped and took control of Aaron. When the Doctor attempted to jettison it out of the TARDIS and into a supernova, Aaron nearly got sucked out too, and Ryan finally proclaimed that he loved him and forgave him, helping save Aaron's life. Returning Aaron, Lin and Mitch to their lives, Ryan promised to call Aaron when he next returned and continued his adventures with the Doctor. Appearances =Television= Ryan Sinclair is introduced in the eleventh series premiere, \\"The Woman Who Fell to Earth\\". Ryan is a 19-year-old living in Sheffield, England who is training to be an electrical engineer while working part-time as a warehouse worker. He was raised by his paternal grandmother, Grace O'Brien, who recently married his step-grandfather, Graham O'Brien. Grace worked as a nurse, and met Graham while he was undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, about three years before they met the Doctor. Ryan and Yasmin Khan were in primary school together, though at the time they didn't know each other very closely. Ryan has dyspraxia, a coordination difference that impacts his motor skills. Though his symptoms are relatively mild and high-functioning, it affects his sense of balance to the point that he finds tasks like riding a bicycle extremely difficult. His father, Aaron, a marine electrical engineer, made an appearance in the 2019 New Year Special. Aaron has been absent most of Ryan's life since the death of his mother, and was also absent for Grace's funeral. =Other media= In September 2018, three Series 11 tie-in novels were announced, all of which feature Ryan Sinclair ‚Äì The Good Doctor, Molten Heart and Combat Magicks. Ryan is depicted on the cover of Molten Heart. Casting and development On 22 October 2017, it was announced that Cole had been cast as a companion in the eleventh series of Doctor Who, and would appear alongside Jodie Whittaker in 2018. On 26 September 2018, following the premiere of The Woman Who Fell to Earth, the fact that Ryan would have dyspraxia was officially revealed by the media. Showrunner Chris Chibnall explained: ‚ÄúIt's a relatively common thing among kids, so I think it's important to see that heroes come in all shapes and sizes.‚Äù Considerable research was undertaken with the Dyspraxia Foundation to ensure an accurate portrayal of the condition.

In the show's eleventh series, starting with the first episode, Graham served as a companion of the Thirteenth Doctor, an incarnation of the alien time traveller known as the Doctor (portrayed by Jodie Whittaker). His character is portrayed as an everyman; a retired bus driver in remission from cancer. Graham returns for the show's twelfth series in 2020.  Character biography  = Early life = Graham was born in Essex, during either the late 1950s or early 1960s, saying he was \\"only a toddler\\" in 1962. As a child, Graham attended Sunday School in Chingford, and sometimes spent summer holidays at Margate and Whistable. After his mother passed away, Graham's father \\"got rid of all her things super quick\\", unable to keep hold of them, telling Graham that \\"she's gone now and that's the end of it\\". Graham worked as a bus driver, once having a supervisor who he would recall as behaving similarly to Thomas Edison. After he retired, Graham still kept in contact with his friends who also worked as bus drivers. = Marriage with Grace = Graham developed cancer and met his wife Grace, a chemo nurse, while undergoing treatment. When he told Grace that he was a bus driver, she remarked that he ought not to be like James Blake, who she called \\"Blake the Snake.\\" He learned of her appreciation of Rosa Parks and that she owned a t-shirt that said \\"The Spirit of Rosa\\". Once the cancer was found to be in remission, Graham married her and had become her second husband by 2015. = Meeting the Doctor = Whilst returning home after an unsuccessful session of teaching Ryan how to ride a bike, despite his insistence that he was \\"doing it, mate\\", Grace and Graham were trapped when a swarm of gathering coils attacked their train in search of Karl Wright, a fellow passenger. He, along with Grace, Ryan and Yasmin Khan, helped the Doctor battle both the coil and its controller, Tim Shaw. Whilst the Doctor recovered at his and Grace's home, he went around Sheffield to ask if anyone had seen anything unusual. Later, Grace and Graham followed the Doctor's orders to pose as construction managers and evacuate the construction site Karl worked at, so the Doctor, Ryan and Yasmin could rescue him. However, the gathering coils were still active, with Tim Shaw using them to damage the crane that Ryan and the others were on. Despite Graham's protests, Grace climbed up and destroyed the creature by electrocuting it with live cables. However, Grace was also electrocuted in the process and fell to the ground. Mortally wounded, she died in Graham's arms, after telling him to not be afraid without her. After she died, Graham organised her things into boxes, finding the childhood possessions of her son, Aaron, as he did. At Grace's funeral, Graham spoke of how Grace inspired him during their three-year marriage and felt guilty that he hadn't died instead. Sometime after the funeral, Graham helped the Doctor construct a teleporter to take her to her TARDIS. Though he meant to stay behind, he, along with Yasmin and Ryan, were accidentally brought along with her. Believing the pair to be bonuses in the Rally of the Twelve Galaxies, Angstrom scooped Ryan and Graham out of deep space and transported them aboard her ship. On Desolation, he found Yasmin and the Doctor, who had been similarly saved by Epzo, Angstrom's rival in what would become the final stage of the rally. The rivals, with the Doctor and her friends in tow, were tasked by Ilin, master of the rally, to race across the planet; the first to reach the finish line at the Ghost Monument would win 3.2 million krin and salvation from planet's hostile surface. The Doctor discovered that the Ghost Monument was, in fact, her TARDIS, phasing in and out of reality. After the Doctor stabilised the TARDIS, Graham entered it for the first time and the Doctor attempted to take him, Ryan and Yaz home. = Trying to return home = The TARDIS deposited the Doctor and her companions in 1955 Montgomery, Alabama instead of returning them to Sheffield due to large traces of Artron energy. Graham was initially excited about his first journey back in history and expressed a desire to see Elvis Presley playing. As the only other white member of the group aside from the Doctor, Graham was treated far better than Ryan or Yaz. He defended them from the racism inflicted on them, even coming to Ryan's aid when Mr Steele slapped him for returning a glove to his wife Lizzie. Graham worked to help ensure Rosa Parks began the Montgomery Bus Boycott, using his knowledge of bus drivers to help. He and Ryan encouraged James Blake to leave his fishing spot on his day off after spreading a rumour of a black boycott. Due to Krasko's interference, a distressed Graham was forced to take part in Parks's famous moment of defiance by ensuring the bus was crowded enough for Parks to be asked to give up her seat. Graham ultimately became the passenger that Rosa Parks refused to give her seat up to, sparking the boycott. The Doctor later showed her companions a history of Rosa's life and how she would go on to have a lasting impact on the history of the universe by taking them to Asteroid 284996, Rosaparks. Upon returning home, Graham declined to have tea at Yaz's with Ryan and the Doctor. Instead he returned home, where he imagined Grace was still alive telling him to fix things around the house like she asked. Grieving, he began smelling her clothes despite his vision of Grace telling him it didn't help. Hearing a noise upstairs, he went to investigate, finding an abnormally large spider. Fleeing back to Yaz's, he informed Ryan and the Doctor of what he saw. He joined them to investigate further, giving Ryan a letter from his father he found at home; though Ryan took it, he dismissed reading it right away. After the giant spiders had been dealt with, Graham decided to join the Doctor in the TARDIS as he didn't want to just stay in his house and dwell on his grief. Appearances =Television= Graham O'Brien is introduced in the eleventh series premiere, \\"The Woman Who Fell to Earth\\" (2018). Graham is a retired bus driver and is married to Grace. While travelling on a train in Sheffield, Graham and Grace are attacked by a strange creature, but are saved when the Doctor intervenes. Along with Grace's grandson Ryan Sinclair and PC Yasmin Khan, Graham helps the Doctor stop Tzim-Sha, an alien warrior on a rampage across Sheffield, but their victory costs Grace's life. After burying Grace, Graham joins Ryan and Yaz in helping to teleport the Doctor back to her missing spaceship, but they are inadvertedly swept along with her. After their consequential adventure in \\"The Ghost Monument\\", the Doctor agrees to take Graham, Ryan and Yaz back to Earth. They eventually return to Sheffield in \\"Arachnids in the UK\\", and Graham wrestles with his grief as he begins seeing apparitions of Grace in their home. Eventually, he decides to travel with the Doctor properly as he works through his grief. As they travel together, Ryan ‚Äì who has always rejected Graham as a grandfather figure ‚Äì warms to him and their relationship improves. In \\"It Takes You Away\\", Graham is confronted by the apparent return of Grace while trapped in a mirror dimension. Despite the Doctor's pleas for Graham to recognise that Grace has been created by an alien force to tempt him away from the real world, he struggles to reject her; however, he comes to recognise her as an imposter when she is seemingly indifferent to the fact that Ryan was in peril. After they escape, Ryan calls Graham \\"Grandad\\" for the first time. In the series finale, \\"The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos\\", Graham is confronted by Tzim-Sha's return and vows to avenge Grace's death, despite the Doctor's threat that she won't travel with a killer. Graham does come face with Tzim-Sha, but with Ryan's help he instead apprehends him and locks him in a stasis chamber. =Other media= In September 2018, three Series 11 tie-in novels were announced, all of which feature Graham O‚ÄôBrien ‚Äì The Good Doctor, Molten Heart and Combat Magicks.

On 9 December 2018, it was confirmed that Walsh would return as Graham for series 12, with the series already in production and due to air in early 2020.  Critical reception  In the Radio Times, critic Paul Jones wrote that \\"of the rest of the Tardis team, Bradley Walsh as Graham is the stand-out, a really believable and likeable character and able to convey such a range of emotion in just a few looks\\". Kimberley Bond added that Walsh's performance \\"remind[ed] us that he actually is a proper actor and not just the host of The Chase.\\" Huw Fullerton said that Graham has been the \\"surprise emotional powerhouse\\" of the new series.

Its size at the time was much larger than the current one that stands today. It was one of the largest medieval domains of the area, owned by a French noble family who also possessed, among others, the Ch√¢teau de Jarny, located in what is now known as Jarny in the department of Meurthe-et-Moselle.

The ch√¢teau remained within the Nettancourt-Vaub√©court family until 1961, where it was then acquired by the commune of Mantes-la-Ville into a summer camp center. The center fell into disuse in the 1980s.

The purpose of the operation  After there defeat in the North Caucasus Operation (1920), the White Army remained only in control of the Crimean Peninsula. Despite the fact that by the beginning of August 1920, the White Russian Army had already had a number of military successes in the Northern Taurida Operation, they were not decisive, and the Army of Wrangel remained locked in Northern Tavria. Some drastic actions were needed to retake the strategic initiative from the Bolsheviks. In this context, from July 1920 a plan was developed for a large landing operation in the Kuban. According to the plan of the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Army, Lieutenant General Baron Wrangel, the landing of a large force in the Kuban could create a new anti-Soviet front there and expand the socio-economic, political and territorial base of the White movement in mobilizing the anti- Soviet-minded local population (Kuban Cossacks). The landing was to be carried out in three places and the groups were to occupy Ekaterinodar, Maikop, and subsequently the whole Kuban area.  The operation  Ulugay with his force of 8,000 men landed on August 14, at the Vereshchaginsky-farm, 7 km north of the village of Primorsko-Akhtarskaya, which was also taken after a battle with two companies of the Red Army of some 500 men. The vanguard of the White cavalry under personal command of General Ulagay immediately advanced towards Timashyovsk, the railway junction leading to Ekaterinodar. After several fierce battles, by August 18, the White army had already captured a significant bridgehead of 80 km wide and about 90 km deep. On August 15, a second assault force of 1,500 men commanded by General Cherepov landed north of Novorossiysk. They were joined by 2,000 Cossacks from the neighboring villages. To counter the invasion, the commander of the Caucasian Red Front, Vladimir Gittis, gathered numerous reserve troops (3 rifle divisions, 4 cavalry and 1 rifle brigades) and formed two groups: one to strike from the north into the flank and rear of the Ulagay group, and one for a frontal strike from the east. From August 18 to 21 August, the units of General Ulagay were regrouping and no longer advanced. On August 21 and 22, the Red Army attacked and the Whites could not withstand and began to retreat, until the front stabilized after renewed White counterattacks. On the night of August 25, Wrangel executed a third landing of some 3,000 men under the command of General Kharlamov on the Taman Peninsula. This group was able to take the Peninsula but were was unable to advance further than the isthmuses. The landing party was soon counterattacked and by mid-September 2, the troops of Kharlamov were evacuated. The troops of the second landing under General Cherepov had also been surrounded and forced to evacuate on August 26, after having suffered heavy casualties. On August 30, after stubborn fighting, the Soviet troops occupied the village of Stepna, cutting General Ulagay's Army into two. Despite fierce counterattacks, the Whites failed to retake Stepna. The White now had no option but to withdraw. Under the cover of rearguard battles, the landing forces began to evacuate. By September 7, the evacuation of the main force of General Ulagay was completed in good order from Achuevo. Despite a violent storm that destroyed the marina, everything was shipped out : personnel, horses, artillery, and even armored cars. On September 10, Commissar Sergo Ordzhonikidze reported victory to V.I. Lenin, who considered the defeat of the Ulagay's landing a matter of \\"national importance\\".  Results of the operation  The main reason for the failure of the operation was that the commander of the landing army, at the decisive moment during the offensive, halted the advance to allow the regrouping of his troops, despite the initial plan for a rapid offensive towards Yekaterinodar. This delay enabled the Red Army to rush in reserve troops, create a numerical advantage and block a further White advance. The only positive result from the operation for the Whites was the significant replenishment of Wrangels Russian Army with men and horses. Despite severe losses during the fighting, more troops returned to the Crimea than had left. Around 10,000 Kuban Cossacks had joined the units evacuating back to the Crimea. They brought 6,000 horses with them, which made it possible to significantly strengthen the White cavalry. For example, the division of General Shifner-Markevich lost around 300 men and 200 horses killed and wounded during the fighting in the Kuban, but withdrew with an additional 1,200 men and 250 horses to the Crimea. According to other sources, in total only 1,500 Kuban Cossacks and 600 horses followed the evacuating Ulagay Force to Crimea, and an important reason for the failure was the lack of response of the war-weary local population to the operation. On October 12, 1920, a truce was concluded between Poland and Soviet Russia. This enabled the Red Army to move troops from the Polish front to the Crimea and launch a successful offensive in November (the Perekop-Chongar operation). On November 17, the White Army evacuated the Crimea and the war on the Southern Front came to an end.

It caused the 2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami.  Geometry  It extends from near Dondowa, North Luwu Regency, in the south, where it links to the WNW-ESE trending Matano Fault. It continues northwards, heading offshore through the Gulf of Palu and passing to the west of the Minahassa Peninsula, before eventually linking with the North Sulawesi Subduction Zone. Although it is a strike slip fault, there are locally normal and thrust features and segments. Near Palu it forms the western side of the Palu Basin, a small pull-apart basin developed along the fault system.  Regional setting  The fault forms the boundary between two of the major microblocks that form the island, the North Sula Block and the Makassar Block. The current slip rate along the Palu-Koro Fault is estimated to be in the range per year, compared to a long term slip rate of per year over the last 5 million years.  Seismicity  The fault is known to be highly active and several historical earthquakes are thought to have occurred on this zone, in 1905, 1907, 1909, 1927, 1934, 1968, 1985 and 1993. From trenching across the fault, three major earthquakes have been identified over the last 2,000 years, suggesting a recurrence interval for major earthquakes of about 700 years. That recurrence interval is insufficient to account for the long-term slip-rate, suggesting that either aseismic creep is important in this fault zone or that other strands have been active, away from the main fault trace.

Mullin (A generalization of the Lucas functions). He was a post-doctoral student at York University.  Career  In 1970 he became Assistant Professor at the University of Manitoba, where in 1972 he attained Associate Professor status and Professor in 1979. In 2001 he became a Professor at the University of Calgary, and Professor Emeritus since 2004. Since 2001 he has held the \\"iCore Chair\\" in Algorithmic Number Theory and Cryptography. Together with Rei Safavi-Naini he heads the Institute for Security, Privacy and Information Assurance (ISPIA) - formerly Centre for Information Security and Cryptography - at Calgary.Website of ISPIA Between 1998 and 2001 he was an Adjunct Professor at the University of Waterloo. He was a visiting scholar at the University of Bordeaux, at Macquarie University and at University of Leiden. From 1978 to January 2007 he was Associate Editor of the journal Mathematics of Computation.

He developed custom hardware for number-theoretical calculations, for example the MSSU in 1995.Hardware Sieves: Function and Applications, and other projects In cryptography, he developed in 1994 with Renate Scheidler and Johannes Buchmann a method of public key cryptography based on real quadratic number fields.Buchmann, Williams: Quadratic fields and cryptography. In: Loxton (Hrsg.): Number theory and cryptography. 1989 Williams developed algorithms for calculating invariants of algebraic number fields such as class numbers and regulators. Williams deals with math history and wrote a book about the history of primality tests. In it, he showed among other things that √âdouard Lucas worked shortly before his early death on a test similar to today's elliptic curve method. He reconstructed the method that Fortun√© Landry used in 1880 (at the age of 82) to factor the sixth Fermat number (a 20-digit number).Williams: How was F_6 factored? In: Mathematics of Computation. Band 61, 1993, S. 463. Landry publizierte seine Methode nicht, es fanden sich aber Hinweise im Nachlass.

It was designed by the Commonwealth Department of Interior and was built in 1936. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012.  History  European graziers raising sheep and cattle in the interior of North Queensland settled the Burdekin River district in the 1860s. The first commercial crop of sugar was produced in 1881 and assured the manufacturing strength of the region. The township of Ayr was laid out in 1882, intended as the centre for the region. Reserves were set aside for administrative and government purposes, including the court house, police station and post and telegraph office. In 1884, James Palmer constructed the first post office and residence to a design by John James Clark, then the Colonial Government Architect in Queensland's Public Works Office. The first postmaster was Thomas Bishop who lived in the separate quarters neighbouring the post office on the south side. In the 1930s, the earlier post office and residence were replaced by the current building, after the Burdekin Shire Chairman led a deputation to the Australian Postmaster General's Office requesting a more adequate building. On 21 April 1934, the Prime Minister Joseph Lyons announced that plans for the new Ayr Post Office had been completed and was expected to cost about to construct. Ayr Post Office was designed by the Commonwealth Department of Interior, which took over responsibility for constructing post offices in Queensland in 1921-23. The building occupied the site of the previous post office. Separate quarters were again provided on the south side (but have since been removed). It was completed in 1936  Description  Ayr Post Office is at 155 Queen Street, corner Young Street (formerly Bey Street), Ayr, comprising the whole of Lot 1 RP742482. Queen Street is Ayr's main street and part of the Bruce Highway. It is part of a civic precinct with the community centre, courts and police station, the council offices and nearby Country Women's Association building. A war memorial and clock lantern on the adjacent traffic roundabout enhances the setting to the building, including the corner landmark intersection. Further north, Queen Street has been upgraded including the erection of a steel-framed shade structure along the length of the median strip. The street is flanked by single storey commercial buildings and shops. The post office site is rectilinear in plan and bound by a chain wire fence. A gravel driveway along the west boundary divides the post office from the neighbouring telephone exchange and provides access to the loading dock subsequently built at the rear of the building. A concrete block hipped roof storage shed has been built in the southwest corner of the site. The post office is near symmetrical on its entry frontage to Queen Street comprising twin corner porches which flank the parapeted postal hall, but is otherwise asymmetrical to the side and rear elevations. It reproduces several of the \\"Georgian\\" details of the former quarters (designed by John James Clark), including the pattern of windows. In the manner of smaller Commonwealth-designed post offices of this period, the frontage is parapeted with three tall windows across the postal hall, and with differing windows behind the two entries on either side. Blocks of steps provide access from street level framed by brick piers with rendered capping. The hipped roof is symmetrical about the post office breakfront, but the flanking hip and the figuring of the rear eaves for the main hip are irregular, including from the entrance elevation. The composition plays off a centralising postal hall wing and prominent roof lantern with flanking roof eaves of irregularly varying heights. Overall, it is delineated as an institutional building but retains the small, quasi- residential character that marked post office designs during the 1900-1914 period. Entry to the central retail shop is via the original side porches and steps. The north wing and Young Street entry have been altered by the removal of walls and the installation of a post office box lobby which extends along the length of the elevation. The lobby exits through an opening formed in the west wall and onto a disabled ramp at the rear. Post office boxes have been added to the south porch and the west end of the side south porch infillled to house the air-conditioning plant. Internally, the building has three main sections relating to the front retail shop counter area and the L-shaped mail sorting room behind it; the lunch room, store, strong room and office along the south; and the enclosure of the former verandah along the west to provide (south to north) a cleaner's room, lockers, toilets, loading dock, night mail and contractor's rooms. The original planning of Ayr Post Office comprised a symmetrically composed twin porch with a central break-fronted and pedimented postal hall. The planning arrangement provided dual but independent operation of the postal and telegraphic functions around the central postal hall. The inner walls of the south and side porch have been fitted with private boxes. The north porch had two telephone booths at the corner and its west wall had two counter windows and a pay hatch to the exchange. The public postal area while small, contained a counter and writing slope along the front (east) window wall; behind this, the open mailroom extended across the building width at the rear. Original documentation indicates that the north section of the building accommodated the telegraphic functions. Entered separately off Young Street, an L-shaped passage provided access to the mechanics room, store, phonogram and the exchange which was partitioned with half glazed screens. A mail verandah extended across the full width of the building at the rear (west). The majority of internal walls associated with the exchange areas along the north of the building have been removed to accommodate the external post office box lobby. At the rear, the former verandah has been infilled and subdivided as staff amenities; the central loading dock has been enlarged by the addition of a steel-framed structure. The south end of the former mailroom has also been subdivided for administrative use and to facilitate ducting from the mechanical plantroom installed in the former side porch. The mailroom has been further decreased in sized by the enlargement of the retail shop which extends into the central third of the area along the east and the post office boxes along the north. The original counter and writing slope has been removed and the retail area refurbished with standard Australia Post livery. Notwithstanding the changed pattern of circulation and use, the external presentation of the building is able to demonstrate aspects of the original design including the parapet frontage, hipped roof form, smooth rendered finish and stylised mouldings. The main alterations to the exterior concern the enclosure of the rear mail verandah, the addition of a door and awning over the rear disabled ramp, the service and loading dock additions and the installation of the plant room in the side porch. Internally, much of the original fabric and detailing associated with key areas has been altered or removed including the suite of rooms associated with the exchange along the north, and the central post hall at the front. The installation of partitions has impacted on the former open areas associated with the mailroom and rear verandah. The enlargement of the Australia Post retail shop and the installation of shelving conceal the front window wall and disrupt the general sense of enclosure. A number of original openings have also been infillled. Key elements relating to the external building fabric are: * Original composition of a central parapeted breakfront to Queen Street flanked by corner side porches with integrally designed steps and building entries * Original steps and entry to Young Street * Central fleche and ventilator shaft = Condition = Externally and internally the building is in relatively sound condition, well maintained and with no major defects visible. The installation of acoustic tile generally conceals the extent of original finishes associated with the ceiling vents. = Original fabric = Original fabric of the building which survives includes: * Structural frame: Load- bearing masonry construction on brick piers with timber floor and roof framing. Concrete floor areas to corner and side porches areas and former staff lavatories in the southwest corner. * External walls: Painted stucco rendered walls with a moulded string line to the ground floor level and a moulded cornice which encircles the building. Window openings have moulded cement surrounds and projecting sills. Smaller corner openings have decorative metal screens in a diamond pattern. * Internal walls: Generally hard rendered walls with recessed (struck) dado line and curtain rails. Door openings have painted moulded architraves with a number of 4-panel doors and operable glazed highlights over intact. Perimeter windows have double hung multi-pane sashes. * Floor: Timber boarded floor generally with moulded timber skirting boards, subsequently lined with carpet and vinyl. Concrete slab porch areas and steps subsequently resurfaced with quarry tiles. * Ceiling: Fibrous plaster strapped ceilings with moulded cornices generally replaced/concealed with plasterboard acoustic tiles. Corner porch ceilings have strapped plaster ceilings and moulded cornices although the south porch has been relined with plasterboard. Ceiling area associated with rear verandah is raked in profile and lined with strapped masonite/asbestos sheet. * Roof: Hipped roof is timber-framed originally lined with shingles and subsequently reclad with metal sheet impressed in a tiled pattern. Eaves soffits are lined and strapped and rainwater goods include decorative rainwater heads either side of the central front windows. * Front building inscription \\"AYR POST OFFICE\\". * Fleche clad in copper, shingles, rusticated diamond render and weatherboards and formerly housing a Malley's patent 18\\" ventilator shafts to vents in the mailroom [refer to NAA architectural documentation]. * Timber slats to enclose the sub- floor area.  Heritage listing  Ayr Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Ayr Post Office, built in 1936, is one of many smaller post offices designed and built throughout Queensland in the interwar period to service towns and regional centres. While the building is not the original post and telegraph office (constructed in 1884), and is not associated with the earliest development of the Burdekin area, it is significant for its association with the local civic precinct which includes the community centre, courts and police station, council offices, and Country Women's Association building. The war memorial and clock lantern on the adjacent traffic roundabout complement the historic context and setting for the building. The relative degree of external intactness and overall heritage character of the building also enhance this value. Criterion D: Characteristic values Ayr Post Office is an example of: * Retail post office typology (third generation 1930-1974) * Interwar c.1915-1942 Georgian Revival * work of the Commonwealth Department of the Interior (H Mackennal) Typologically, Ayr Post Office, built in 1936, is an example of a third generation retail post office. This generation of typologies demonstrate an emergent retail function in postal operations, separation of the telephone exchange area and increased requirements for larger post office box lobby areas with independent access and serviced by a frontally positioned mail sorting room and/or a rear-loading yard. These aspects are evident in the original design to the extent it comprised a symmetrically composed twin porch arrangement, with a central breakfront postal hall to Queen Street. Telegraph and postal services operated independently either side: the south and side porches were fitted with private boxes and the north porch had telephone booths and windows and pay hatch to the exchange. Subsequently, the exchange areas along the north of the building have been replaced by a post office box lobby, the central retail function has been enlarged and the mailroom subdivided. These works have had limited impact on the external presentation of the building, but have impacted on the internal planning and related typological aspects. Stylistically, the building's Neo-Georgian Revival front is conservative and limited to threedimensional massing, symmetry and low-relief decoration. It is considered to be a late application of the style, albeit neat, logically detailed, and comparatively intact externally (in terms of the main presentation). The post office design is also carried over from the suburban post offices of the 1910s and a later series of 1920s timber post offices, and is a late example of colonial revivalism in a small public building, combining a monumentalising breakfront around the postal hall in a tradition which dates from earlier post offices of c.1910-30. The Colonial Revival exterior texture had been employed on public buildings in Queensland from around 1910. While acknowledging the conservative design of the building, Ayr Post Office is relatively intact externally, has neatly executed detailing, and a pleasing symmetrical form; it is considered to reach CHL threshold for this value. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics Ayr Post Office is a domestically-scaled building with dual street frontages and some landmark qualities. These are principally due to its parapeted breakfront to Queen Street, corner side porches and highly visible fleche/roof lantern. The aesthetic and landmark qualities also derive from the building's proximity to the prominent war memorial and clock lantern located on the traffic roundabout in front of the building. The building is also part of a valued local civic precinct. Further, the post office, including the war memorial, features in tourism and promotional material for the town again emphasising its aesthetic/landmark importance. Criterion G: Social value The social value of Ayr Post Office, which has provided continuous postal services for over seventy years, is enhanced by its landmark siting and prominent position within the local civic precinct. The building is also part of a valued local civic precinct. The social significance of the post office is additionally demonstrated in it being included, together with the war memorial, in tourism and promotional material for the town.

It has 91 locations. Formerly operating as Gala Bingo clubs, they were re-branded as Buzz Bingo clubs in September 2018, whilst the Gala brand continues to run its own online bingo and casino offerings under the ownership of GVC Holdings. History Buzz Bingo has undergone several changes in ownership and branding including through acquisitions. They were originally Coral branded, a division of Bass plc. In 1983, there were 22 clubs and 24 located in their Pontins holiday camps. The ownership acquisitions included a chain of 80 bingo clubs from Thorn EMI for ¬£18.2 million in 1983, followed by another 30 by purchasing Zetters Leisure for ¬£23 million in 1988. Granada plc's chain of 74 bingo clubs were added in 1991 for ¬£147 million. This merger with Granada led to the company rebranding as Gala Clubs later that year. Gala was officially launched on 17 October 1991 when 17 clubs re-branded and launched a new image. There followed a series of further acquisitions under the Gala brand, including 17 clubs from Ritz in July 1998, 10 clubs from Jarglen in March 2000 and 27 Riva Bingo Clubs from First Leisure for ¬£90 million in April 2000. Towards the end of 2000, Gala then began a series of expansions outside of their bingo operations, with casinos from the Hilton Group in December 2000 and the Jamba Online business in 2001. This was later followed by a series of private equity sales of the company starting in February 2003 to the private equity firms Candover and Cinven. Permira bought a stake in the company in August 2005, which valued the business at ¬£1.89 billion. In October 2005, Gala acquired Coral Eurobet for ¬£2.18 billion and changed its name to Gala Coral Group, creating the United Kingdom's third largest bookmaker and largest bingo operator. By 2015, Gala Coral was acquired by its rival Ladbrokes, but the Gala Bingo clubs were not part of the merger, and were subsequently sold to Caledonia Investments for ¬£241 million in December 2015. This meant that the clubs used the Gala brand under licence from the Ladbrokes-Coral group and decided during 2018 to re- brand as Buzz Bingo.  Operations  Buzz Bingo now operates all the clubs previously on the High Street as Gala Bingo and launched its own online bingo, buzzbingo.com offering shortly after the rebrand was completed.

Life  Born in Ussel (Corr√®ze), Lagorce was admitted in September 1951 to the Conservatoire de Paris where he met Maurice Andr√©. He won a first prize for cornet in 1954 then a first prize for trumpet in 1955. In 1956, he joined the French Republican Guard Band. From 1957 to 1967 he was solo trumpeter with the Symphony Radio Orchestra, which became the Philharmonic Orchestra of the ORTF. From 1967 to 1993 he was solo trumpeter with the Orchestre de Paris. He has been a member of the brass quintet Ars Nova founded in 1964 by Georges Barboteu (French horn) with Bernard JeannoutotBernard Jeannoutot (BnF) (trumpet), Camille VerdierCamille Verdier (Discogs) (trombone) and Elie RaynaudElie Raynaud (BnF) (tuba). In 1976 he took over as Maurice Andr√©'s interim teacher at the Conservatoire de Paris, and taught there until 1988. He provided an open teaching of the cornet and trumpet. Among his students, the most famous are Fr√©d√©ric MellardiFr√©d√©ric Mellardi (principal trumpet of the Orchestre de Paris), Pascal Vigneron (professor at the √âcole Normale de Musique de Paris), Herv√© NoelHerv√© No√´l Professor at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels, Michel Barre, Andr√© Chp√©litch, Marc Bauer (principal trumpet of the Orchestre National de France) Since 1994, he has been a member of the Harmonie municipale de Limoges,Harmonie municipale de Limoges where he first played the horn and then the tuba. He is responsible for several publications and methods for learning the trumpet that are widely used today in conservatories and music schools.  Discography  Lagorce had a game very close to his friend Maurice Andr√©. The two men were friends, thus whenever Maurice Andr√© needed a second trumpet with him, Lagorce was usually there. So it was naturally for the Erato record label that Lagorce worked. He is present in many orchestral and concertos pieces alongside Maurice Andr√©, with Jean-Fran√ßois Paillard's chamber orchestra. Several of these recordings have won the Grand Prix du Disque and remain a reference: the suites of J S Bach, Handel's Water Music, Vivaldi's Concerto for Two Trumpets.

The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1989. Overview The site is located in the alluvial lowland of Iriyama, facing Toyama Bay on the Noto Peninsula, and contains the site of a settlement which was continuously occupied over a 4000 year period from the beginning of the J≈çmon period to the end of the J≈çmon period. In an excavation survey conducted over a four year period from 1987 an enormous number of relics were discovered, and the site was found to have clearly defined stratigraphic layers facilitating dating. The relics included an abundance of animal bones (especially dolphins), plant relics, as well as engraved pillars, rope, knitted materials, masks, the foundation posts for large raised-floor buildings, and pit dwellings. The site also contained an unparalleled range of pottery from every portion of the J≈çmon period, and also all the pottery forms known to have existed in the Hokuriku region, as well as many examples from other regions in Japan, making the site of critical importance into J≈çmon pottery research.

He lives in East Anglia and is a regular performer on the Norfolk Folk Roots and acoustic music scene, and occasionally on the London Celtic Punks scene. Morra is second cousin to the English singer Morrissey. Morra is part of the 'who's who' of the London Irish scene and is often called upon to sing and play at significant events. It was at Morra's launch of his 2014 EP 'The Patriot' where a tribute to recovering Paul Mad Dog Mcguinness (of the famous Shane MacGowan and The Popes band lore) was held. In April, 2017 he played at the \\"Backward Glance\\" movie fundraiser for film maker David P. Kelly on the work of London Irish painter Bernard Canavan. Following his cappella (unaccompanied solo) at the Norwich Cathedral Centenary Service of Edith Cavell in October, 2015, Morra released his album on the famous martyr, \\"Patriotism is not enough\\" Staying with the English female martyrdom theme, Morra released his album \\"Boudicca‚Äôs Country\\" collaborating with Gareth Calway on lyrics.

It provides free access to data on wind power density and wind speed at multiple heights using the latest historical weather data and modeling, at an output resolution of 250 meters. It was developed and is maintained by the Wind Energy Department of the Technical University of Denmark (DTU Wind Energy) in partnership with the World Bank, with funding provided by the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP).  History  The original version of the Global Wind Atlas (GWA 1.0) was developed by DTU Wind Energy under the framework of the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM) and, in particular, the CEM Working Group on Solar and Wind Technologies, led by Germany, Spain and Denmark. The Technology Development and Demonstration Program of the Danish Energy Agency (EUDP 11-II, 64011-0347) funded GWA 1.0 as the Danish contribution to the objectives of the working group. GWA 1.0 was launched in 2015, and benefited from collaboration with the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the MASDAR Institute. The IRENA Global Atlas of Renewable Energy created a dedicated platform to serve GWA 1.0 data to a worldwide audience.http://www.irena.org/newsroom/articles/2015/Oct/Seeing-the-Wind-with- the-New-Global-Wind-Atlas In early 2017, DTU Wind Energy entered into discussions with ESMAP at the World Bank to update and improve the Global Wind Atlas, and bring it into line with the Global Solar Atlas that was launched by the World Bank in January 2017. Utilizing funding provided under ESMAP's existing initiative on renewable energy resource assessment and mapping, the company VORTEX FDC > was commissioned to carry out a global mesoscale wind energy modeling exercise at 9 km resolution. This data was provided to DTU Wind Energy for further microscale modeling, initially down to 1 km resolution. In November 2018 the Global Wind Atlas (GWA 2.0) was launched by DTU Wind Energy and the World Bank at the Wind Europe 2018 conference in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, based on a completely redesigned user interface developed by the company Nazka Mapps.

Following further modeling work, a new version of the microscale modeling data was released in July 2018 (GWA 2.1), bringing the resolution down to 250 meters. This was followed by a further release in September 2018 (GWA 2.2) that included a number of improvements to the user interface, a new tool for preparing and downloading poster maps, and various bug fixes. The most recent release, in November 2018 (GWA 2.3) introduced three capacity factor layers, new wind roses, and improved calculation of power density, and the ability to download GIS files, among other features. The latest release of the Global Wind Atlas (3.0) was launched on October 25th 2019, featuring further methodological modeling improvements, all new raw data (based on 10 years of mesoscale time-series model simulations), data coverage spanning 200 kilometers offshore, two additional heights (data now at 10, 50, 100, 150 and 200 m above ground/sea level), as well as the introduction of the all new energy yield calculator, allowing users to a) specify a generic or custom wind turbine and b) create downloadable GIS-data for annual energy production, capacity factor, or full load hours for estimating power generation for any given point or area.  Methodology  The Global Wind Atlas is based on a coupling of mesoscale to microscale modeling.http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/487951544824248725/Guidance- on-Mesoscale-Wind-Mapping ESMAP, 2018. \\"Guidance on Mesoscale Wind Mapping\\".

The mesoscale modeling carried out by Vortex uses ERA Interim meteorological re-analysis data provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. While tools such as the Global Wind Atlas can provide useful data to support planning and initial site scoping, they are no replacement for the more detailed analysis needed when evaluating actual wind farm projects.  Outputs and usage  Global map of wind speed at 100 m above surface level. Philippines wind power density map at 100 m above surface level. In addition to the data available via the Global Wind Atlas website, users may also download poster maps, GIS data, and Generalized Wind Climate (GWC) files for use in commercial wind resource assessment software such as WAsP.

Washington, DC: World Bank. The methodology used the 200 km of offshore wind data coverage, added a 1 km buffer zone, and then mapped any areas up to 1 km in depth with wind speeds above 7 m/s. The analysis divides the resource potential into fixed foundation and floating potential, with a cut-off of 50 m water depth for fixed. 55 regional and country maps have since been published and the analysis has been cited in a number of other publications.

From Monday 7 May 2018 to Friday 18 May 2018, Wizards of the Coast released two podcasts a day to support the launch. Contents Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes is narrated by Mordenkainen, a wizard originally created by Gary Gygax for his World of Greyhawk campaign. Mordenkainen acts as the guide for players in this campaign. *Preface *Chapter 1: The Blood War *Chapter 2: Elves *Chapter 3: Dwarves and Duergar *Chapter 4: Gith and Their Endless War *Chapter 5: Halflings and Gnomes *Chapter 6: Bestiary *Appendix: Monster Lists Publication history In February 2018, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes was announced. An exclusive edition with alternate cover art by Vance Kelly was released early to select game shops on May 18, 2018. The book was published on May 29, 2018. The Oblex, one of the monsters in this book, was conceived by Make-A-Wish recipient Nolan Whale during his day at Wizards of the Coast. SyFy Wire in 2018 called it one of \\"The 9 Scariest, Most Unforgettable Monsters From Dungeons & Dragons\\", saying that \\"Eaten by an ooze that can then use your memory and form to trick and lure others in? That‚Äôs the stuff of horrors ‚Äî and the stuff of an epic adventure. If you weren't paranoid about other characters before, you should be now!\\" Reception Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes won the 2019 Origins Award for best \\"Role-Playing Game Supplement\\". Bleeding Cool gave a positive review, appreciating the addition of sub-races to Tieflings and details on conflict within Elf and Gith society, also allowing Gith PCs to become a viable option. Rpg.net gave a rating of 83% with a positive response to the tone captured in the book and the planar background and resources which it gives to DMs. The score was lowered due to the lack of a PDF version that didn't rely on a third-party app, and for reusing verbatim much material from previous editions. Cameron Kunzelman, for Paste, wrote that \\"on one hand, I don‚Äôt think that Mordenkainen‚Äôs Tome of Foes is a bad sourcebook for D&D.; It has lots of great information about the different playable species of the game, their pantheons of good and evil gods, and solid explanations for how those gods impact the long and short term lives of those species. [...] Asmodeus, the lead devil of the cosmology, is delightfully Satanic, and even reading through the book I was trying to figure out how to fit him into the campaign that I am currently running without disrupting the flow and feeling of the world that I am working in. And that, for me, is the other hand: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes feels like a book you need to build your campaign around. The two previous sourcebooks of its type, Xanathar's Guide to Everything and Volo's Guide to Monsters, are both books that I use constantly as a Dungeon Master. The former is a rules expansion and clarification that helps to build out the interactions of any campaign, and the latter is a book of monsters that any party could come upon during any given romp through the world. They are books that are grounded in the dusty roads and dirty swords of fantasy tabletop campaigns, and they slot easily into the workflow that I have to make those kinds of adventures feel good. Mordenkainen‚Äôs Tome of Foes doesn‚Äôt work that way. It starts at a very high level of the D&D; cosmology, and it feels harder to borrow from or augment than other D&D; source books\\". Rob Hudak, for SLUG Magazine, wrote that \\"Tome of Foes has little mechanical application for most players outside of the additional playable races, save for probably the most important facet in all role-playing games‚Äîinspiration.[...] Tome of Foes may have the pages you need to conjure richly imagined facets for both playable characters and narrative threads alike, and I think it‚Äôs in that latter category where this book offers the greatest value. From the position as a dungeon master, Mordenkainen‚Äôs Tome of Foes is a must-buy. There are a couple sections of the bestiary that feel slightly recycled, namely the demon and devil lord stat blocks. The adventure Out of the Abyss has a dedicated segment specifically for these unholy rulers and their context in this region, but that‚Äôs ultimately a negligible detail when you consider the immense top-level detailed contribution to the unremitting conflict between them. I vastly prefer the direction and focus 5E took with its supplementary books by dressing them in a vibrant tapestry built on decades of D&D; history. When flipping through dozens of new monstrosities on display, I become giddy with anticipation for the countless opportunities to terrify and captivate my players\\".

Between 1991 and 2005, he committed at least 12 murders associated with rape.  Biography  Romanov lived in the town of Bagrationovsk. In 1991, he committed the double murder of teenage girls whose bodies he later buried. Due to the absence of the corpses, the victims were considered missing and the case remained unsolved. During the same year, he raped a 12-year-old girl and tried to strangle her. The victim remained alive and gave a description of the offender, with Romanov being arrested soon after and sentenced to 10 years in prison. While in prison, he was raped by another inmate. After his release in 2001, Romanov began working in the private transport industry. In order not to go to prison again, Romanov carefully planned his crimes. His victims were young girls and women between 12 and 19 years, whom he always raped and then killed, either burying the bodies in the forest or sometimes burning them. On September 25, 2006, he attempted to rape a 24-year-old whom managed to escape and remember his car's registration number. Two days later, Romanov was arrested. He immediately confessed to killing a number of girls between 2001 and 2005, a total of 10 murders being established. He also confessed to the 1991 double murder. = Victims = Romanov described in detail some of the killings. Here are some of his descriptions:¬´–Ø –£–ë–ò–í–ê–õ –î–ï–í–û–ß–ï–ö¬ª  Death  Romanov was placed in Kaliningrad's pre-trial detention center No. 1, and was immediately put in solitary confinement. On October 11, 2006, he confessed to committing a thirteenth murder, the circumstances of which he planned to tell later. However, on the night of October 12, the 56-year-old pedophile hanged himself with his bed sheets, leaving a brief suicide note addressed to his son, in which he apologized to his family. The investigators suspected that Romanov could be responsible for up to 20 murders.–ú–∞–Ω—å—è–∫ –ø–æ–≤–µ—Å–∏–ª—Å—è  In the media  * \\"Hunting for Maniacs\\" - \\"Channel First\\" (2008).

It features Jean-Claude Van Damme performing gymnastic splits between two moving trucks set to the music \\"Only Time\\" by Enya. The director was Andreas Nilsson. It was the sixth advert released in the series called Live Test which Swedish advertising agency Forsman & Bodenfors had created for Volvo Trucks. The runway of the closed Ciudad Real Central Airport in Spain was selected as the shooting location during the five-month planning period. Following three days of rehearsals, the stunt footage featuring van Damme was recorded in a single take. Van Damme was protected by a hidden safety harness and wire not visible in the final result. A small platform was fitted to each truck behind the wing mirrors to support Van Damme's feet during the stunt. Mikael Rosell was the driver of the truck steering sideways. Both trucks were driving in reverse at a fixed speed of , with co-drivers in each of the two trucks to help monitor the speed. Filming was performed with an Arri Alexa digital camera mounted via a boom to a camera car. The long shot was done in a single take, because of the position of the sunrise. Some colour grading and removal of reflections and safety wires was done by The Mill during post- production. One week after release, Epic Split had been viewed online 25 million times, and after nine days reached 40 million views. Enya's music \\"Only Time\\" re-entered the Billboard Top 100 reaching , thirteen years after the original release. An initial international follow-up market research survey by GfK found Epic Split to be the most attention grabbing of the six adverts in the Live Test series, but less effective than the other five in causing immediate action of the viewer. Neuroscientific analysis showed that female viewers were more intrigued and engaged during the split itself; whereas male viewers sympathised with the pain possibly being felt by Van Damme, subsequently leading to high memory encoding effectiveness at the precise point of the \\"Volvo Dynamic Steering\\" message being shown. By late-2014 the overall campaign was estimated to have cost $3‚Äì4 million to produce, and generated $170 million in revenue for Volvo. Parody Less than a week after Volvo released the advert, a face-swapped variant was distributed, with Van Damme replaced by Rob Ford, then Mayor of Toronto. In November 2013 during the filming of 22 Jump Street, a parody was created with actor Channing Tatum performing the splits between two food trolleys. In December 2013, a parody was created apparently showing Chuck Norris as Walker, Texas Ranger performing a similar manovuer between two aircraft to the opening lines of Hamlet. As the camera pulls back eleven Commandos are seen balancing on the character's head in the shape of an illuminated Christmas tree. Five years later, the director of Epic Split, Nilsson, would go on to film a commercial for Toyota Tacoma pickups featuring the real Chuck Norris. Awards In May 2014, Epic Split won the Best in Show award from The One Club. During 2014 Epic Split won a Black Pencil award from the Design and Art Direction design awards in 2014. In December 2014, the advert received six prizes including the Film Grand Prix at the Eurobest awards in Helsinki, Finland. In 2015, it won another prize at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, for Creative Effectiveness.

Since 1933, it has been located at 5 rue Blomet, in the 15th arrondissement of Paris.  History  = Foundation (1906-1952) = The √âcole normale catholique was born in the context of anti-clericalism which marked the start of the 20th Century in France. The law of 7 July 1904 introduced by √âmile Combes meant the dissolution of Catholic religious houses, forcing them to move to other European countries. In this atmosphere, there also came the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, leading Mlle Desrez, teacher, and friend of Madeleine Dani√©lou, to decide in 1906 to create a normal school to fill the gap in girls' education and to teach Christian teachers. It was located at 90 rue de Rennes, initially for primary education, but its development led to growth, and the ENC moved to 159 rue de S√®vres. From its origin, Louise Desrez surrounded herself with teachers and trainees, mostly from the Institut catholique de Paris or the Coll√®ge Stanislas de Paris. In 1922, Mlle Marguerite Eymard succeeded Mlle Desrez, after working as her assistant. Due to the precarious lease on the building in rue de S√®vres, the construction of a new building was decided upon. Jean Verdier, archbishop of Paris inaugurated the new school on 20 December 1934. The ENC also built an annexe on rue Olivier-de-Serres in 1939: the √©cole Saint-Jean was born. = The Jesuit era (Since 1952) = In 1952, the headteacher, Mlle Marguerite, appealed to the Society of Jesus, to ensure the sustainability of their work. The ENC specifically worked with the Society of Jesus Christ, a Jesuit teaching congregation who already ran the √©coles Chevreul in Lyon and Marseille and who practiced Ignatian pedagogy. Mlle Deshaires took over the running of the school. In 1988, the establishment, then equipped with a college and a lyc√©e, started to offer classes pr√©paratoires aux grandes √©coles in literature. In 2003, the Society of Jesus Christ joined with the Sisters of the Company of Mary, Our Lady. In September 2015, a new law stream in preparatory class D1 was opened in partnership with the universit√© Panth√©on- Assas, mostly preparing students for the ENS Cachan but also for civil service entrance examinations, and allowing them to access law studies at university.

It is popular with rock climbers due to its easy access, the range of short easy-to- intermediate rock climbs, and its close proximity to the much larger and highly regarded, Ailladie rock-climbing sea-cliff; Ailladie is also locally known as the Ballyreen Cliffs or Ballyreen Point. Rock climbing Ballyryan crag from the south The Ballyryan rock climbing crag is located right beside the Ailladie Car Park on the R477 road, which is opposite the Stone Wall section of the Ailladie sea‚Äìcliff (see map below). While Ballyran's first rock climbing routes date from the early 1970s (e.g. Whose Corner (VS 4c), and Whacky (HS) grade), it is noted that Irish \\"Tiglin\\" climbing groups conducted courses on many Ballyryan routes without recording their ascents. While most of Ballyryan's routes are circa 10‚Äì12 metres high and between Diff to HVS, its proximity to Ailladie, with its numerous severe climbs, has led to a number of E‚Äìgrade climbs being put up in the crag, namely, Agony Aunt (E2 5c) and Crack 90 (E3 6a). For various reasons, Ballyryan's rock climbing routes are sometimes described as being \\"difficult to protect\\" when \\"leading\\", and therefore an extra degree of caution is needed. Novice climbers can \\"toprope\\" for safety.

Relationship with Galileo The son of Francesco Arrighetti and Fiammetta Ginori, as a young man he was a private student of Galileo‚Äôs, together with his cousin Andrea Arrighetti. Around 1614, Arrighetti assisted Galileo in replying to an attack by Giorgio Coresio on his views of the behaviour of bodies in water. Arrighetti maintained a close interest in Galileo‚Äôs experiments in physics and his mathematical work (notably on the flow of water in both straight and twisting channels). It was also Arrighetti who brought Galileo news from Benedetto Castelli about the dispute between Castelli and Cosimo Boscaglia, that prompted Galileo to write his Letter to Benedetto Castelli. A number of Galileo‚Äôs notes, sketches and drawings on various topics, including motion, were recorded or copied by Arrighetti. Other scholarly interests Arrighetti was a member of the main Florentine academies and delivered some notable orations at the Accademia della Crusca in praise of Filippo Salviati and of Cosimo II, Grand Duke of Tuscany. In 1623 he succeeded Galileo as consul of the Accademia Fiorentina after having previously served as a councillor three times. He was also consul of the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno. It was probably as a result of a petition from Arrighetti that Prince Leopoldo de' Medici and Grand Duke Ferdinando II decided to refound that Platonic Academy which had been the pride of fifteenth-century Florence. Arrighetti devoted a great deal of his studies to the work of Plato, and worked on translations of his Dialogues. He also had wide literary interests and wrote an unpublished work, Oeconomicus in which he emphaised the importance of teaching being conducted in a secluded or composed environment as well as comic monologues ('cicalate') 'on the cucumber' and 'on the cake.' His manuscript works included essays on philosophy, dramas, comedies and poetry. Arrighetti died in Florence on May 29, 1639 and was buried in San Marco.

History  In the Middle Ages Kleinburgwedel, together with Gro√üburgwedel, Oldhorst, Neuwarmb√ºchen and Fuhrberg, formed the Burgwedel parish. Despite the many war costs, Duke Wilhelm found means to buy goods. On January 6, 1361, he and Duke Ludwig von Aschwin von Alten acquired many yards and lodges at Kleinburgwedel, Th√∂nse, Wettmar, Engensen, Schillerslage, Burgdorf, Sorgensen, Weferlingsen and Aligse with all accessories, except those pieces which Aschwin von Alten had borrowed and reserved for sale. Only the goods to Kleinburgwedel had Aschwin owned by the Duke Wilhelm zu Lehn; From the rest he vowed to grant him and Duke Ludwig the fief. The church books are preserved from 1661. They show an average population growth of 1.5%, which only slightly decreased in 1830. Due to its location on the southern edge of the L√ºneburg Heath, bees are kept in Kleinburgwedel until today. Between 1589 and 1900, between 70 and about 150 peoples were regularly placed in straw baskets. Since the mid-20th century, the number of bee colonies is subject to strong fluctuations. On August 28, 1808, a big fire disaster occurred in Kleinburgwedel. In a single night, eleven residential buildings and 16 outbuildings burned down.Matthias Blazek: Das L√∂schwesen im Bereich des ehemaligen F√ºrstentums L√ºneburg von den Anf√§ngen bis 1900. Adelheidsdorf 2006, S. 177, . The Second World War did not affect Kleinburgwedel at first. In the immediate vicinity was a small barracks camp for Soviet prisoners of war. The actual war action reached the village, as English bomber units flew large attacks on Hanover in October 1943. On October 9, a British Halifax crashed into the meadows after heavy hits west of Kleinburgwedel. On 18 October, a major bomber group threw incendiary bombs on the village, which was actually intended for Hannover because of poor visibility. It burned down 40 buildings; a large number of others were seriously damaged. On March 1, 1974 Kleinburgwedel was incorporated into the new community Burgwedel.  Politics  = Community council = The local council of Kleinburgwedel consists of five councilors, currently held by: * CDU: 3 seats * SPD: 1 seat * Greens: 1 seat = Mayor = The mayor is J√ºrgen Schodder (CDU). His deputy is Friedhelm Leisenberg (CDU). = Coat of Arms = The design of the coat of arms of Kleinburgwedel comes from the heraldic and coat of arms artist Gustav V√∂lker, born in Isernhagen and later living in Hanover, who had already designed the coats of arms of Gro√üburgwedel, Mellendorf, Wunstorf and many other localities. The approval of the coat of arms was granted by the district president in L√ºneburg on December 9, 1959. Blazon: \\"In silver in front of a high, five-pinned, red wall, a stylized, silver oak, growing from the middle of five stones. In the green Schildfu√ü a lying, silver Wolfsangel. \\" Crest reason: The red wall reminds that in former times a castle was present in Kleinburgwedel, which was destroyed 1521 in the Hildesheimer pin feud. The remains of the castle wall with thirteen large boulders and strong oaks have been preserved until 1870. Therefore, the stones and the oak tree were added to the coat of arms. The Wolfsangel symbolizes the belonging to the district Burgdorf, which also leads this sign in his coat of arms.  Culture and sights  = Green Areas = In the district is the progressively running and 2014 largely dry fallen W√ºrmsee. A larger area was covered with water at the beginning of 2016. It was probably created in the 19th century from a peat sting and reached an area in the order of ten hectares. Already in the empire the Hanoverians used it as a destination for excursions. Townspeople built a number of weekend cottages on the banks, which were used to house refugees after 1945 and were expanded into a larger settlement. The boat rental was discontinued a few years ago.

Now this term also means a kind of scenic art of small forms of mainly popular-entertaining direction, including such directions as singing, dance, circus on stage, illusionism, colloquial genre, parody, clownery. As a kind of cultural and economic activity, the Estrada is an integral part of show business. Artists performing in the Estrada genre are called Estrada Artist or Artist of Estrada. The Russian estrada nowadays is a diverse group of artists representing both pop-song genre and other genres of theatrical art. Alla Pugacheva, Valery Leontiev, Sofia Rotaru, Philip Kirkorov, Oleg Gazmanov, Lev Leshchenko, Iosif Kobzon, vocal and instrumental ensembles, pop groups and rock bands represent the variety-song genre: \\"Samotsvety\\", \\"Pesnyary\\", \\"Mashina Vremeni\\" ,\\"Zemlyane\\",\\" Aria \\",\\"Alice\\",\\"Mumiy Troll\\", \\"Zemfira\\" and many others. The spoken genre is represented by such artists as Gennady Khazanov, Evgeny Petrosyan, Efim Shifrin, Victor Koklyushkin, Klara Novikova, Semyon Altov, Lion Izmailov, Mikhail Zadornov, Pavel Volya, Garik Martirosyan, the Urals pelmeni team, etc. From the musical-creative point of view (more specific) in Russia (the USSR) and North Korea, the term \\"Estrada\\" is also called a closed group of people whose speeches are broadcast exclusively on state TV. The so-called \\"state actors\\", that is, the performances of which are approved by the dominant party (CPSU, Juche Party). At the same time, all the rest can be strictly censored. There are also Estrada theaters, for example, the Moscow Estrada Theater, the St. Petersburg Estrada Theater, the Kiev Estrada Theater. In such theaters, as a rule, the spoken genre predominates (for example, reprises and humoresks), as well as humorous and satirical plays and miniatures are staged. In the press, writing about estrada performers and estrada stars, sometimes an allegorical classification is used, adding the title to the name of the estrada artist. For example, \\"prima donna of the Russian estrada\\", \\"king of glamor\\", \\"king of Russian chanson\\". Also, official honorary title, included in the system of state awards of the Russian Federation, as \\"Honored Artist of Russia\\" or \\"People's Artist of Russia\\" can often be added.

He played college football and track at University of Wisconsin-Platteville. Early life Arnold was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and raised in Janesville, Wisconsin, but attended school in Rockford, Illinois as his mother was a teacher at Boylan Catholic High School. He attended Boylan Catholic for three years before his family moved to North Dakota. He then attended Shanley High School in Fargo, North Dakota. Professional career =New Orleans Saints= Arnold went undrafted in the 2017 NFL Draft, but received invitations to attend rookie minicamp and tryout for the Kansas City Chiefs and New Orleans Saints. On June 5, 2017, the Saints signed Arnold to a three-year, $1.66 million contract. On June 16, 2017, the Saints placed Arnold on injured reserve due to an unspecified injury. Arnold was initially waived/injured, but was placed on injured reserve after clearing waivers. On July 26, 2018, it was reported that the New Orleans Saints' coaching staff had elected to move Arnold from wide receiver to tight end. Arnold was moved in order for him to have a better chance of making the roster. The move was partly due to the release of tight end Coby Fleener, leaving the a lack of depth at the position. Assistant head coach/tight ends coach Dan Campbell oversaw Arnold's transition to tight end and Arnold credits him with his success at tight end. Throughout training camp, Arnold competed to be the third tight end on the depth chart against Michael Hoomanawanui, John Phillips, Garrett Griffin, and Deon Yelder. Arnold impressed the coaches with his ability during training camp and made the active 53-man roster. Head coach Sean Payton named Arnold the third tight end on the Saints' depth chart to begin the regular season, behind veterans Benjamin Watson and Josh Hill. Arnold was inactive for the first four regular season games (Weeks 1‚Äì4) as a healthy scratch. On October 8, 2018, he made his NFL debut during the Saints‚Äô 43‚Äì19 win against the Washington Redskins in Week 5. In Week 7, he made his first career reception, a ten-yard reception from Saints‚Äô quarterback Drew Brees during the second quarter of a 24‚Äì23 win at the Baltimore Ravens. He finished the game with two receptions for 35 yards. On November 11, 2018, Arnold earned his first career start and made two receptions for 25 yards as the Saints defeated the Cincinnati Bengals 51‚Äì14 in Week 10. On November 22, 2018, Arnold scored his first touchdown against the Atlanta Falcons on a 25-yard reception. On August 31, 2019, Arnold was waived by the Saints and was signed to the practice squad the next day. He was promoted to the active roster on October 19, 2019.

The area is roughly conterminous with Samburu and Laikipia Counties and portions of Baringo, Turkana and (possibly) Meru Counties. The group spoke a common tongue related to the Maasai language, and typically herded cattle. The Loikop occasionally interacted with the Cushitic, Bantu, and Chok peoples. The confederacy had dispersed by the 21st century. Etymology Johann Ludwig Krapf of the Church Missionary Society in East Africa arrived on the East African coast in December 1843. Krapf made his first trip into the interior the following month and encountered reports of the nearby Okooafee and their southern neighbors, the Quapee. He deduced that the two groups were the same people within a year, and began referring to them as Wakuafi in his writings. In 1852, Krapf learned that the Wakuafi called themselves the Iloikop. He published a vocabulary of the Engutuk Eloikob in 1854, speculating that Iloikop was an abbreviation of the word engob (land or country) combined with the article loi and defining Iloikop as \\"those who are of/in the country, to whom it belongs\\")Falola, T. and Jennings, C. Sources and Methods in African History: Spoken, Written, Unearthed, p. 174. Stigand (1913) noted that the term \\"Loikop\\" referred to \\"the people of the country of Laikipia\\" and that at the time it survived in the Rendille word \\"Lokkob\\". In Rendille the word Lokkob was used to \\"denote any cattle-breeding tribe, such as the Samburr or Masai, in distinction to a camel breeder\\". In another account, he notes; =Associated terms= It has been suggested that the term Wakuafi was a Swahili term first used to represent all Iloikop peoples, and later narrowed to represent only the non-Maasai Iloikop. It is believed that the word Humba (or Lumbwa) was, likewise, a Bantu word used by the Bantu peoples of the interior to refer to Iloikop pastoralists. Later writers noted other names used to refer to the same group of people. The Turkana, with whom the northern regions had significant interaction, referred to them as Kor. The present-day Samburu refer to themselves as Lokop (or Loikop), and the Turkana call the present-day Samburu Kor.Spear, T. and Waller, R. Being Maasai: Ethnicity and Identity in East Africa.

University of California Press (1994), p. 62. According to Imenti tradition, the Mwoko of that region were also known as Ikara (or Agira); in most other regions, the Ukara (in its variations) and the Muoko (in its variations) are seen as separate.Fadiman, J. When We Began There Were Witchmen. University of California Press (1994), p. 82. History =Sources and historiography= The journals, letters and published articles of the first three missionaries of the Church Missionary Society in East Africa (Johann Ludwig Krapf, Johannes Rebmann and Jakob Erhardt), written during the 1840s and 1850s, are the earliest documented evidence of Loikop history. Although the writings of the first missionaries were consistent in their descriptions of the Loikop, they have been widely disregarded in favor of later written and oral sources. It has been suggested that the reason is the difference between their views of the Loikop and those of later writers, and views held by 20th-century Maasai after the linguistic, demographic and identity changes of the Maasai era.Falola, T. and Jennings, C. Sources and Methods in African History: Spoken, Written, Unearthed, pp .173-174 online. Krapf arrived on the East African coast in December 1843, and made his first trip into the interior in January 1844. He encountered reports of the nearby \\"Okooafee\\" and their southern neighbors, the \\"Quapee\\". Krapf deduced within a year that the two groups were the same people, and he began referring to them as Wakuafi in his writings. In 1852, he learned that the Wakuafi referred to themselves as Iloikop.Falola, T., & Jennings, C., Sources and Methods in African History: Spoken, Written, Unearthed p.174 At this time, The Swahili name Wakuafi was used to describe all Iloikop peoples, although it was later narrowed to represent only the non-Maasai Iloikop. Accounts by missionaries and explorers during the 1870s and 1880s generally agreed with those of early missionaries, with distinctions among the Maasai, Wakwavi and Lumbwa beginning to appear. In an early account, Thomas Wakefield described the \\"poor Wakwavi ... [who,] having long since been robbed of their cattle by the Maasai, were compelled to turn their attention to agricultural pursuits\\". Charles New concurred in 1873 with his predecessors' assertion that the Maasai and \\"Wakuavi\\" called themselves Orloikob, which he translated as \\"possessors of the soil\\"; both groups were pastoralists. In his 1887 account, Through Maasai Land, Joseph Thompson made an observation which was a subtle but significant departure from previous accounts: \\"... However, we are including several isolated areas occupied either by tribes wholly different from the Masai, or by the agricultural Wa-kwafi, who are mere off-shoots of the Masai\\". This inverted the previous understanding of the Wakwavi-Maasai relationship.Thompson, J., Through Maasai land: A journey of exploration among the snow clad volcanic mountains and strange tribes, Royal Geographic Society p.238 online The inversion of the order laid out by Krapf, Rebmann and other explorers became the standard interpretation, possibly as the result of changes on the ground brought about by the Iloikop wars whose net result was the absorption of Iloikop identity by the Maasai.Falola, T., & Jennings, C., Sources and Methods in African History: Spoken, Written, Unearthed p.186-187 Origins Nile records indicate that the three decades starting about 1800 were marked by low rainfall levels in regions south of the Sahara. East African oral narratives and the few written records indicate peak aridity during the 1830s resulting in recorded instances of famine in 1829 and 1835 in Ethiopia and 1836 in Kenya. Among Kenyan Rift Valley communities this arid period, and the consequent series of events, have been referred to as Mutai. A feature of the Mutai was increased conflict between neighboring communities, most noted of these has been the Iloikop wars. Earlier conflicts preceding the wars appear to have brought about the pressures that resulted in this period of conflict. Von H√∂hnel (1894) and Lamphear (1988) recorded narratives concerning conflict between the Turkana and Burkineji or at least the section recalled as Sampur that appear to have been caused by even earlier demographic pressures. =Turkana - Burkineji conflict= Turkana narratives recorded by Lamphear (1988) provide a broad perspective of the prelude to the conflict between the Turkana and a community he refers to as Kor, a name by which the Turkana still call the Samburu in the present day. Lamphear notes that Tukana traditions aver that a dreamer among them saw strange animals living with the people up in the hills. Turkana warriors were thus sent forward to capture one of these strange beasts, which the dreamer said looked 'like giraffes, but with humps on their backs'. The young men therefore went and captured one of these beasts - the first camels the Turkana had seen. The owners of the strange beasts appear to have struck the Turkana as strange as well. The Turkana saw them as 'red' people, partly because of their lighter skin and partly because they daubed their hair and bodies with reddish clay. They thus gave them the name 'Kor'. Lamphear states that Turkana traditions agree that the Kor were very numerous and lived in close pastoral association with two other communities known as 'Rantalle' and 'Poran', the names given to the Cushitic speaking Rendille and Boran communities. According to Von H√∂hnel (1894) \\"a few decades\\" prior, the Burkineji occupied districts on the west of the lake and that they were later driven eastwards into present day Samburu. He later states that \\"some fifty years ago the Turkana owned part of the land on the west now occupied by the Karamoyo, whilst the southern portion of their land belonged to the Burkineji. The Karamoyo drove the Turkana further east, and the Turkana, in their turn, pushed the Burkineji towards Samburuland\\". =Fragmentation= According to Maasai traditions recorded by MacDonald (1899), the expansion of early Eloegop (Loikop) communities into a society occurred from a base east of Lake Turkana on three fronts. Pushing southward from the country east of Lake Turkana the Loikop conquered a number of communities to occupy the plateaus adjacent to the Rift Valley. On the eastern escarpment, one front occupied the plateau now known as Laikipia and brought the Ogiek there under their patronage. Another front continued the southward expansion to the southern plateaus, as far as or even beyond Mount Kilimanjaro. The third front occupied the western escarpment, conquering the 'Senguer' people who dwelt on the plateau now known as Uasin Gishu and almost annihilated this community. This expansion was followed by the development of three groupings within the Loikop society. The Sambur who occupied the 'original' country east of Lake Turkana as well as the Laikipia plateau. The Guash Ngishu occupied the grass plateaus of the Uasin Gishu and Mau while the Maasai territory extended from Naivasha to Kilimanjaro. The mythological rendition of this account as record by Straight et. al (2016) states that \\"three Maa clan clusters ‚Äì Loiborkineji, Maasai, and Laikipiak ‚Äì came out together...from the (baobab) Tree of Tangasa\\". Territory Stigand (1913) made notes concerning \\"the old Laikipia, the Loikop\\" people and their territory. He stated that \\"according to (his) informants, the country north of Gilgil and extending from this place to the Borana was in the old days called 'Laikipia', a name which is now confined to the plateau between the north of the Aberdres ranges and the Lorogai Mountains. The Masai inhabiats of this tract were called 'Loikop' or 'the people of the country of Laikipia'.\\" Peoples =Samburu= According to traditions captured by MacDonald (1899), the Sambur were one of the three principal groupings that formed following fragmentation of the Loikop society. The Samburu historians interviewed by Straight et. al (2016) note that the Burkineji was one of the communities that arose from the separation. They do note that the 'Samburi Loiborkineji separated from the other Maa-speakers' in the wake of the 1830s mutai. This was just after the Lkipiku generation had been initiated. This separation is said to have occurred at a river; Samburu referring to a large, distinctive leather bag (sampur) which the Samburu carried: Lorere Lesampur (\\"people of the big bag\\").Lemoosa, P. A Historical Study of the Transformation of the Samburu of North-Central Kenya. Kenyatta University, p. 22. =Uasin Gishu= According to traditions captured by MacDonald (1899), the Uasin Gishu were one of the three principal groupings that formed following fragmentation of the Loikop society. Samburu historians interviewed by Straight et. al (2016) state that there was an initial fragmentation of Loikop society into three groupings and that one of these were 'the Laikipiak, who \\"went around Mount Kenya and northward\\"'. However, certain accounts note that the name 'Laikipiak' arose after their livestock were afflicted by rinderpest, after which they were called Lorere Lokipei (\\"people whose cattle have the disease\\").Lemoosa, P. A Historical Study of the Transformation of the Samburu of North-Central Kenya. Kenyatta University, p. 22. At the dawn of the 19th century, the Uasin Gishu occupied the plateaus to the west and south-west of the Laikipia plateau. This group included small but notable sections of Loosekelai (i.e Siger/Sigerai people) =Maasai= According to traditions captured by MacDonald (1899), the Maasai were one of the three principal groupings that formed following fragmentation of the Loikop society. Samburu historians interviewed by Straight et. al (2016) concur that there was an initial fragmentation into three groupings and that the Maasai were one of these. Conflict =Maasai - Enkangelema conflict= An early instance of conflict is that recorded between the Masai and Eng√°nglima tribe who were pushed out of the plateaus later known as the Nyika in the 1820s and 1830s. This conflict is generally regarded as a prelude to the main Iloikop wars. Krapf writing in 1854, as the Iloikop wars raged, wrote about the conflicts that affected the 'Eng√°nglima tribe which occupied the vast territory situated between Usambara, Teita, and Ukambani...'. He notes that they; =Maasai - Kwavi conflict= New (quoted in Markakis) writing in 1873 recorded accounts of conflict between the Masai and a community he refers to as 'Wakwavi', he states that; A similar account was recorded by Thompson in 1883 as part of a broader account on the conflicts that had occurred. He notes that prior to the attack by the Maasai, the Kwavi whose original home comprised \\"the large district lying between Kilimanjaro, Ugono and Pare on the west, and Teita, and Usambara on the east\\" had suffered repulses in raids against the 'Wa-gogo' and later against the 'Kisongo', their land had also been afflicted by locusts and...; Internecine conflict The narratives recorded by MacDonald state that at the time of fragmentation of the Loikop peoples, there was a certain internal jealousy that gradually developed into open conflict. The conflict now referred to as the Iloikop wars. MacDonald noted that; Thompson writing in 1883 also recorded accounts of the conflict, stating; Stigand (1913) also made note of the decision and intention of the Laikipiak to \\"attack and completely overwhelm the southern Masai...that they might cease to exist as a tribe\\". However, \\"when the southern Masai heard that they were coming, they combined together and came forth to meet them. They met the Loikop north of Nakuru...\\". Stigand gave a detailed account of the battle, one that has been retold since within a number Kenyan of communities. Thompson later recounts a trek past 'Giligili' where he noticed \\"an ernomous Masai kraal, which could not have held less than 3000 warriors, and then some distance beyond appeared another of equal, if not larger dimensions.\\" On inquiry, Thompson learned that these were the respective camps of the Masai of Kinangop and Kapte, on the one hand, and the Masai (Wa-kwafi) of Lykipia on the other. He was told that this was; \\"During one of their long periods of deadly fighting, in which they thus settled down before all their cattle, and fought day after day, till one gave in\\". Diaspora Krapf, Rebmann and Erhadt recognized that Iloikop society consisted of a number of sectional groups (which they called tribes), and each group was generally named for the geographical area they inhabited. Iloikop tribes who were noted as existing (or recently dispersed) in the mid-19th century included the Parakuyo, Enganglima, Mao, Baringo, Ndigiriri, Tigerei, Laikipiak, Modoni, Kopekope, Burkineji (also known as Samburu) and the Maasai tribes (who had separated considerably from the rest of the Iloikop regions.Falola, T. and Jennings, C. Sources and Methods in African History: Spoken, Written, Unearthed, p. 179 online. Thompson (1893) recognized ten 'districts' that Masai country was divided into. He noted that individuals were generally designated by their native district. The districts he listed were; Sigirari, Njiri, Matumbato, Kapte, Dogilani, Lykipia and Guas' Ngishu. Later historical accountsPavitt, N. Kenya: The First Explorers. Aurum Press, p. 112. and Samburu oral tradition refer to two principal groups in Loikop society: the Samburu and the Laikipia. The Maasai are noted in these later accounts as speaking the same language (known today as Maa), although they are perceived as a different group.Pavitt, N. Kenya: The First Explorers. Aurum Press, pp. 8, 11-12, 51 and 68.

He was also suspected of committing four additional murders, which could not be proven.  Biography  Retunsky was born in 1950 in the town of Povorino, Voronezh Oblast, RSFSR. Before he got married and had a son, he was tried for rape and causing death by negligence. Prior to his arrest, he worked as a driver for the VAZ company in his hometown. Retunsky picked up every victim at the roadside, thereby luring them in his trap: from the passenger's side, the truck lacked an internal door handle. Then Retunsky threatened and raped these women, eventually killing them. It was also reported that the killer mutilated bodies of several victims, cutting off body parts and taking them away. The murders lasted until 1996, when Retunsky was arrested due to a combination of circumstances. Having raped and killed another victim, he took her rottweiler puppy home, and when the dog was seen near his house, Retunsky was detained. During the search, a collection of pornographic films and several notebooks of poems about the love towards his \\"work\\" were found in the house. In total, the investigation established eight murders, although Retunsky himself admitted to only two. He had to be guarded heavily to avoid any lynching attempt from his fellow countrymen, and the trial was held in a closed court. The Voronezh Regional Court then sentenced Retunsky to death, but after appealing it, it was commuted to 15 years imprisonment, since at the time there were no life sentences. He served his sentence in the Vladimir Central Prison. In 2012, after serving the 15-years sentence, Retunsky returned to his hometown and settled in with his sister. He was on the police account, being forbidden to leave the house from 10 PM to 6 AM and visit entertainment institutions. Under the assurances of the management of the Investigative Committee for the Voronezh Oblast, relatives of Retunsky's victims were taken under state protection. Later in the spring of 2012, Vladimir Retunsky was again detained by law enforcement agencies on charges of stealing 1,500 rubles.–ù—É–∂–Ω–∞ –ª–∏ –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ –≤—ã—Å—à–∞—è –º–µ—Ä–∞ –Ω–∞–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–∏—è: –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å–µ—Ä–∏–π–Ω–æ–≥–æ —É–±–∏–π—Ü—ã The Povorino District Court sentenced him to 5 years imprisonment.

The artwork is Basquiat's response to the portrayals of African Americans in the entertainment industry.  Background  Jean-Michel Basquiat started as a street artist writing graffiti as SAMO, then became immersed in the Downtown art and music scene. He was in an experimental band called Gray, but he was also connected to the emerging Hip- Hop movement. Basquiat was friends with graffiti artists such as Fab 5 Freddy, Toxic and Ramellzee. In 1983, Basquiat produced the hip-hop single \\"Beat Bop\\" by Rammellzee and K-Rob, and he created the cover art. Ramellzee and Toxic accompanied Basquiat to Venice, Los Angeles while he prepared for his March 1983 show, his second at the Gagosian Gallery in West Hollywood. While in Los Angeles, the trio called themselves \\"The Hollywood Africans\\" as social statement to counter the stereotypical portrayals of African Americans in Hollywood. During this trip, Basquiat painted Hollywood Africans, which questions the depictions of African Americans in film, particularly during the Golden Age of Hollywood.  Analysis  Set to a golden yellow backdrop, at the center of Hollywood Africans is a self-portrait of Jean-Michel Basquiat and his friends artists Toxic and Rammellzee, who accompanied him to Los Angeles. To the upper left of Basquiat are the numeral 12,22, and 60, his birthdate. As he often did in his works, Basquiat crossed out some words and phrases. He explained that this was actually meant to direct attention to them, \\"I cross out words so you will see them more; the fact that they are obscured makes you want to read them.\\" Across the canvas are phrases such as \\"HOLLYWOOD AFRICANS FROM THE NINETEEN FORTIES\\" and \\"WHAT IS BWANA?\\" which indicate Basquiat is questioning the depictions of African Americans in film in the 1940s. Bwana is the Swahili word for master or boss. The date 1940, written at the top of the painting, may refer to the year actress Hattie McDaniel became the first African American to win an Oscar for playing the racial caricature \\"Mammy\\" in Gone With The Wind (1939). With the notations \\"TABACCO,\\" \\"SUGAR CANE,\\" \\"GANGSTERISM,\\" and the title of the artwork, \\"HOLLYWOOD AFRICANS,\\" Basquiat seems aware of the limited roles given to African Americans in both Hollywood and real life due to discrimination. On the left side of the painting are blue footprints, referring to the footprints of movie stars outside of the Grauman's Chinese Theatre on the historic Hollywood Walk of Fame. Basquiat and his posse are challenging the perception of three young black men in Hollywood and are cementing their place in history.  Exhibitions  Hollywood Africans is part of the permanent collection at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. In 2017, it was exhibited at the Barbican Centre in London as part of Basquiat: Boom for Real. In 2020, the artwork will display at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston for its exhibit, Writing the Future: Basquiat and the Hip-Hop Generation.

Background  Ilai Harsgor Hendin was born on September 30, 1980 and grew up in Kfar Saba. Hendin is the grandson of the late Professor Michael Harsgor. From 1995-1998 he studied at Katzanelson highschool in the city. Hendin studied law and computer science at the University of Haifa and holds L.Lb and B.Sc degrees respectively. From April 2006 to October 2010 he worked as a software engineer for Microsoft, Vicon and IBM and was instrumental in the establishment of various startup companies.  Political activism  From 2009 to November 2013, Hendin served as head of the Meretz party in Kfar Saba. In 2009, Hendin, along with journalist and former member of Knesset, Nitzan Horowitz, was among the founders of the \\"Free Israel\\" () organization. From November 21, 2013 until the 17th of May 2016, Hendin served as deputy mayor of Kfar Saba. As deputy mayor, he led a revolution calling for transparency in the department for Environmental Protection and turned Kfar Saba into the first city which banned the use of cancerous fumigation. Hendin was also an advocate against the religious influence in the city and forged cooperation with pluralistic entities calling for a more open form of Judaism including the appointment of two women to the religious council. Hendin thwarted an attempt by the former mayor to ban the use of video recorders at city council hearings and himself would broadcast his hearings and those of his faction member, Plia Katner, live on the internet. He left his position after uncovering suspicious dealings which led to the arrest of former mayor Yehuda Ben-Hamo. In September 2016, Hendin, along with other council members from across the country, fought in order to limit the term of office held by elected local city officials. From November 12, 2013 serves as head of the Meretz faction on Kfar Saba's city council. May Day rally, May 1, 2009 In 2016, Harsgor wrote a harsh letter to Meir Medical Center in Kfar Saba after it was reported that Arab and Jewish new mothers are being separated in the wards after they deliver. He said that such ‚Äúsegregation reminds us of periods in history that we don‚Äôt want to return to, and there is no professional justification for separation on the basis of ethnic or religious background.‚Äù He added that Meir Medical Center is ‚Äúa bridge among peoples who live in Israel where one meets patients, families and staff of all backgrounds. The babies born in the obstetrics department don‚Äôt know if they are Arab or Jew; they are human beings who will grow up in a world that we have created for them. We will decide if it is one of racism, hatred or discrimination, or a world that is going to a better place.‚Äù In May 2018, Harsgor expressed outrage when a group of girls was asked to sit in the back due to the presence of religious boys at an event held for Jerusalem Day at the local culture center. That same month he slammed police officials, including Israeli police chief Roni Alsheikh, over what he viewed as extreme security measures taken at a local gay pride parade and threatened to go to the supreme court if they weren't revoked. On October 30, 2018, Harsgor ran for city mayor, as head of the Meretz faction, against Rafi Saar, Yossi Sedbon, Hadar Lavi, Yuval Levi, Zvika Zarfati and Mirit Shaked Barak. While Harsgor came in at 5th place with only 11% of the vote, his party, Meretz came in at number one with 4 seats on the city council. Personal life Ilai Harsgor Hendin resides in Kfar Saba with his wife, Liran, and their daughter.

In 1987, the group moved from its headquarters in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles to Sandy, Oregon. The group sometimes attracted accusations that it was a cult, often from neighbors or the family of members inside the group. Broussard publicly denied the label, including in 1984 and in a 1988 appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The October 1988 death of Eldridge's daughter, Dayna Broussard, prompted the removal of the remaining 53 children in the organization's care and an investigation into the group. The investigation found that the children were subject to extreme fitness training and physical punishments, including floggings. Four EAA staff members were convicted of manslaughter, while Broussard and seven others were charged with child slavery by the Federal government. Broussard died before the trial, while the other seven pleaded guilty to lesser charges.  Founding  The Ecclesia Athletic Association (EAA) was founded in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1975 as a sister organization to the Watts Christian Center, a church. Broussard had been a basketball star at Pacific University, was drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers, and was ordained a minister. He founded the Ecclesia Athletic Association with the goal to \\"lift children out of the dead-end ghetto life through athletic training and strict discipline\\". With the help of donations, which for some members amounted to their entire salaries, the church was able to buy an Avalon Boulevard bakery to serve as a commune. In 1977 Broussard shifted his focus from the Watts Christian Center, which had lost most of its membership, to the Ecclesia Athletic Association, founded by himself and the few remaining members of the Christian Center. Ecclesia sponsored a successful 32-team basketball league, the largest in Los Angeles at the time, and Broussard's sister ran a school focusing on nutrition; children in the care of the Ecclesia Athletic Association stopped receiving formal schooling in 1984. By this time, accusations that the group was a cult were being made publicly. Broussard, who was called \\"The Coach\\" or \\"El\\" by members, denied Ecclesia was a cult, saying: \\"People who call us a cult group have never been [to the Avalon Boulevard building]. They have never examined us. They assume people are kept here because they see our discipline, because our kids walk in a straight line.\\" The children were described as \\"hav[ing] a very clear picture in their minds that they don't want to be the same as other blacks in the Watts community\\". David Jackson, who was 14 when he and his mother Constance Jackson joined the EAA, credits Broussard with rescuing him from gangs, \\"\\"[Broussard] actually was the person that got me out of gangs in LA and...taught me that I have options...\\"  Move to Oregon  Children of the EAA lined up in a row while Eldridge Broussard III (background) yells commands The bulk of the group's members moved to Sandy, Oregon, in 1987, though they did maintain their Avalon Boulevard headquarters. The Sandy property offered a lot more space‚Äì‚Äìon which they planned organically farm and to build a youth camp with pools and gymnasiums in order to train for the Olympics. Broussard told the neighbors they had a \\"plan for the welfare of a lost generation\\". The group quickly dropped their plans for a full youth camp after significant objection from neighbours. The group struggled to farm despite having expensive equipment, though Broussard would later claim the group had grown of produce. By late 1988 Ecclesia housed 53 children ranging in age from six weeks to sixteen years, and the group had a second house in Clackamas, Oregon. The parents of these children were all members of the group; they had been forced to sign a vow of poverty upon joining the group which put themselves, their children, and their assets under Broussard's control. The group never formally registered in Oregon and did not have any sort of license or permission to school its children. The life of EAA residents in Oregon was highly regimented, with the children training under the supervision of Broussard's oldest son, Eldridge Broussard III, who had been born in 1976. Ecclesia members publicly bragged about the physical fitness of the children in the group's Olympic training program, claiming they were capable of performing extensive calisthenics, including one to five thousand continuous jumping jacks and runs of up to ten miles. During a reporter's visit to Oregon, teens and adults were observed working long days in the fields, unable to talk or sing because it would, according to a group spokeswoman, lower productivity. Jackson, who was 18 and a trainer when the EAA moved to Oregon, described the conditions as basic. Neighbors did not notice any signs of bruising or other scars when they saw the children. Some neighbors did experience unusual interactions with the children not seeing them play, and once having one of the children explain she was unable to speak to the neighbor who should instead talk to Ecclesia's minister of external affairs. Some neighbors feared the group was a cult reminiscent of the followers of Rajneesh, who had caused significant disruption in neighboring Wasco County in the 1980s with the establishment of the city of Rajneeshpuram. Their suspicions grew when Ecclesia began planting more crops and attempted to secure zoning permission to place more tents and outdoor toilets across its property in order to legally house 100 people. Neighbors who suspected that the children were being abused repeatedly called authorities. These calls were initially dismissed by officials who felt the group was doing a positive thing by bringing children out of Watts. A deputy who was dispatched after several complaints found 50 children living in a sweltering garage but took no action, with the Oregon Children's Services Division also declining to investigate, as association members explained the children were in a training session and the agency found no problems with the \\"camp environment\\". In response to those neighbors Broussard reacted strongly in an open letter positively comparing their child rearing methods to those of parents who let their kids watch too much television or do drugs. Following an outcry at the zoning application by its neighbors, which included the public release of the vow of poverty, Ecclesia withdrew its application and announced that they were abandoning the property in October 1987. The group had also faced resistance from neighbors in Clackamas, where Broussard was informed his land was zoned for farming, not for housing large numbers of children.  Death of Dayna Broussard  Members of Ecclesia began returning to the Sandy property between February and October of 1988, with most of the children brought there around August. Neighbors reported not hearing any of the children or even seeing lights on in the house except very late at night. Sixty-two people, ranging in age from 1 to 37, were living in the four bedroom house, which had no toilets or refrigerator and no food except a few vegetables. On October 14, 1988, four members of Ecclesia, Willie K. Chambers, Brian James Brinson, Constance Zipporah Jackson, and Frederick Paul Doolittle, brought the body of Dayna Broussard, Eldridge's 8-year-old daughter and the second oldest of five children, to the Sandy fire station. The four were arrested and charged with manslaughter. Eldridge had been in Los Angeles at the time of his daughter's death. While investigating the death of Dayna, child welfare officials learned that 42 of the 53 children, all those who were older than five, were subjected to beatings of at least 100 lashes, and sometimes as many as 800 lashes, with paddles. an electrical cord, and chains. A majority of those 42 were scarred from the punishments and malnourished. The children were also regularly forced to watch others being punished; many had watched the punishment of Dayna which led to her death. In an affidavit, officials described a \\"cruel and terrifying experience, giving rise to mental injury\\". The children were also regularly forced to go with limited food, sleep on the floor, and share only one or two working bathrooms. Authorities explained that no children had attempted to run away because Ecclesia was the only life they knew. Broussard said that the conditions authorities found were due to inexperienced members being placed in charge of the children while he was away. He defended the punishments while talking about the beatings he had experienced from his father and the cultural differences between Watts and Oregon. Following his daughter's death, Broussard announced he was going to shut down both the Ecclesia Athletic Association and the Watts Christian Center. Broussard went on The Oprah Winfrey Show and denied that the EAA was a cult and explained that the methods were necessary to prepare the children for their lives in the city. Time magazine would characterize his appearance in the following way, \\"Grinning and smiling, smirking and haranguing, Broussard evaded all direct questions while blaming the death of his daughter on 'the media.' \\" Despite Broussard announcing that it had been shut down, Ecclesia continued to operate. In the aftermath, Broussard's brother Alvin was arrested for beating a 10-year-old boy at their Watts headquarters but prosecutors declined to charge Alvin with a felony. The Oregon Children's Services Division defended their failure to investigate, stating: \\"The issues raised were not neglect or child abuse, which is the only reasons we can go out in an investigation. They felt that the kids weren't being parented properly and that's not something we go out on. If we went out on every case of parenting skills, first of all we couldn't do it, and second, people would be angry at us\\".  Removal of children to state care  Once in state care, most of the children were placed in two reform schools, with the remainder being placed in foster care. During this time, the children expressed more of a desire to see Broussard than their own parents. The children acted much younger than their age and had little in the way of traditional schooling, instead displaying biblical and fitness knowledge. The children were \\"abnormally quiet and compliant\\" when initially entering care, but became more rowdy when they discovered they would not be beaten for misbehaving. The state attempted to recoup over $30,000 ($ in present US dollars) in costs of caring for the children removed from their parents, though the overall costs of the care were substantially more. By the end of 1988, Oregon state officials wanted to return some children to California to live with relatives. These plans were complicated a few weeks later when the children's parents, who had been visiting their children, announced that they would stop visiting as they refused to renounce their connection to Ecclesia. Ecclesia faced its own roadblocks in reunification when a judge blocked its request in July 1989 to let the children participate in a summer camp. Officials also tried, unsuccessfully, to prevent the children from meeting with defense lawyers. Legal proceedings The trial of Chambers, Brinson, Jackson, and Doolittle lasted three weeks. Many were angry that the defendants were only charged with manslaughter in Dayna's death, which the prosecutor explained by stating that more serious charges would have required more evidence of intent. During the trial, prosecutors said that Dayna's punishment stemmed from her stealing zucchini from another child and escalated from there. Several of the Ecclesia children testified that Dayna had been beaten 200 to 845 times, while children and adults testifying for the defense said it was 50 to 100 times. After a day of deliberation, the jury found all four defendants guilty of first-degree manslaughter. At the sentencing, Broussard asked the judge for clemency, but the four were sentenced to the maximum 20 years. Brinson and Doolittle were eligible for parole in 40 months, Chambers and Jackson were eligible for parole in 10 years. On February 7, 1991, Federal prosecutors indicted Broussard, his brother Alvin, Chambers, Jackson, and four others for child slavery under the 13th Amendment, and denying children their civil rights. Stephen Peifer, an Assistant U.S. Attorney who was involved in prosecuting the case, called Ecclesia \\"the largest child slavery ring in the history of the United States\\". While still awaiting trial, Broussard, who had become more reclusive following the indictments and convictions, died of complications from diabetes on September 5, 1991. On January 17, 1992, the remaining seven \\"pleaded guilty ... to lesser charges and were given prison terms ranging from 2 1/4 to 8 years\\". Brinson was released early from his 20-year prison sentence. In 2002 he was charged with several counts of sexual abuse and found guilty of one count. The charges were unrelated to his involvement in Ecclesia. In May 2013, he was shot to death by three teenagers during a robbery attempt.

He showed no discernible promise as a juvenile in 1999 but over the next two seasons he made steady progress, winning five times in handicap races over extended distances. He emerged as a top-class stayer in 2002 when he won the Sagaro Stakes and the Prix du Cadran. Apart from his victories he finished second in the Goodwood Cup and third in the Cesarewitch Background Give Notice was a bay horse bred in England by his owners Ian Stewart-Brown and Michael Meacock. He was gelded before the start of his racing career and was sent into training with John Dunlop at Arundel, West Sussex. He sired by Warning, the top-rated European racehorse of 1988 who stood as a breeding stallion in Europe before being exported to Japan. The best of his other progeny included Diktat, Piccolo, Charnwood Forest (Queen Anne Stakes) and Annus Mirabilis (Dubai Duty Free). Warning was a male-line descendant of the Godolphin Arabian, unlike more than 95% of modern thoroughbreds, who trace their ancestry to the Darley Arabian. Give Notice's dam Princess Genista won two minor races from eleven attempts but did better as a broodmare as her other foals included Times Up, the dual winner of the Doncaster Cup. She was descended from the Italian broodmare Violetta, whose other descendants included Teenoso, Sir Percy, Rule of Law, Give Thanks and Harayir. Racing career =1999: two-year-old season= In his first racecourse appearance Give Notice contested a maiden race over seven furlongs on 12 October at Leicester in which he started at odds of 10/1 and finished sixth of the nine runners, seventeen lengths behind the winner. Fifteen days later he came home ninth in a similar event over the same distance on good-to-soft ground at Yarmouth Racecourse. He followed up with wins in minor handicaps at Haydock Park and Kempton in July but when moved up in class he finished towards the rear of the field in more valuable events at Goodwood and York. =2000: three-year-old season= On his three-year-old debut Give Notice ran unplaced in a maiden over one mile at Leicester Racecourse on 30 March. The gelding spent the rest of his season competing in handicap races. After finishing sixth over ten furlongs at Redcar in May he was stepped up in distance and recorded his first success over fourteen furlongs at Yarmouth Racecourse a month later. =2001: four-year-old season= As a four-year-old Give Notice continued to race in handicaps over extended distances and showed steady improvement. He finished second at Newmarket, fourth at Goodwood and fifth at York before running unplaced in the Northumberland Plate at Newcastle Racecourse and then coming home third in the stayers' race at the Shergar Cup meeting. He recorded his first success of the year in a minor event over fifteen furlongs at Newmarket on 24 August when he carried 138 pounds and won by three quarters of a length after taking the lead three furlongs out. After running third to Alcazar at Newmarket he started a 33/1 outsider for the Cesarewitch over two and a quarter miles at the same track on 20 October and produced his best performance up to that time as he carried 126 pounds and finished a close third behind Distant Prospect and Palua. At the next Newmarket two weeks later he won the two-mile Stubbs Stakes (a Listed handicap), going to the front approaching the final furlong and beating the three-year-old filly L'Evangile by half a length. For his final run of the year Give Notice was sent to France for the Listed Prix Denisy over 3100 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 23 November, but despite starting a strong favourite he was beaten into third behind Crillon and Le Nomade in a close finish. =2002: five-year-old season= Give Notice began his fourth season with a considerable hike in class as he was entered in the Group 3 Sagaro Stakes over two miles at Ascot Racecourse on 1 May and was ridden for the first time by Frankie Dettori. The 2001 winner Solo Mio started favourite ahead of Double Honour, Persian Punch and Invermark (Prix du Cadran) with Give Notice the 8/1 fifth choice in an eight-runner field. After being restrained towards the rear, Give Notice began to make progress in the last half mile, and was switched left to race down the centre of the straight. He overtook the front-running Persian Punch inside the final furlong and drew away to win by three and a half lengths. John Dunlop commented \\"I think Frankie knew what he was doing there. Give Notice is a tough, improving horse. There aren't many races for him so I suppose we will have to look at coming back here for the Gold Cup.\\" At Royal Ascot in June Give Notice started at odds of 10/1 for the Group 1 Ascot Gold Cup and came home fifth behind Royal Rebel, Vinnie Roe, Wareed and Hatha Anna, beaten four lengths by the winner. In the Goodwood Cup on 1 August he finished second of the nine runners, beaten one and a half lengths by Jardines Lookout. The Lonsdale Cup at York in August saw Give Notice being outpaced in the closing stages and finishing fifth of seven behind Boreas. On 6 October the gelding was sent to France for the Group 1 Prix du Cadran over 4000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in which he was ridden by Johnny Murtagh and started at odds of 6.2/1 in a fourteen-runner field. The Grand Prix de Deauville winner Polish Summer started favourite while the other runners included Persian Punch, Miraculous (Prix Gladiateur), Cut Quartz (Prix Kergorlay), Ice Dancer (Trigo Stakes), Pushkin (Prix Maurice de Nieuil), Bangalore (Northumberland Plate) and San Sebastian (winner of the race in 2000). Give Notice was not among the early leaders but turned into the straight in fifth place and made rapid progress approaching the last 200 metres. In a closely contested finish, which saw less than four lengths covering the first ten finishers, he won by a head from Pushkin, with Polish Summer, Cut Quartz, Clety, Persian Punch, Soreze, Terrazzo, Tiger Groom and Miraculous close behind. Dunlop said \\"Johnny said he would cuddle the horse round and challenge in the last two furlongs. I've never heard of \\"cuddling\\" a horse before but it worked\\". Give Notice was later sent to race in Saudi Arabia but had little success, finishing second in a minor event over 2400 metres in November 2004.

It is a contributing structure on the NRHP East Hampton Village District, replacing the original cottage on the lot situated with the windmill and Rev James historic marker. History By community request of the village board, the Town of East Hampton purchased the Gardiner Mill cottage and lot, which included the 1804 Gardiner windmill, in 2014 utilizing community preservation funding. In December 2014, the village signed off on an agreement to build a replica saltbox style colonial era home and took sole responsibility for a museum. Terry Wallace, owner of the East Hampton Wallace Gallery had agreed to partly donate some of his collection of landscape paintings of the Hamptons (some dating to 1865), while the rest would be acquired by a sizable endowment to the museum funded by the Robert David Lion Gardiner Foundation. John Lyon Gardiner Mill Cottage 20180916 The Cottage The mill cottage and later added extensions and dormers is a colonial-era timber-frame saltbox. It was restored to its 1880s appearance, when it was last renovated by Jonathan Thompson Gardiner. The artist Percy Moran, a nephew of renowned artist Thomas Moran of the Hudson River School of painting, lived there in the early-20th century and the cottage had fallen into dis-repair The decision to replace the structure with a replica was cast as a compromise to restoration. Some nonhistorical add-ons to the original cottage, including porches and dormers, were removed, and the 1880 front porch was reconstructed. A previous kitchen would be recreated to provide an entrance and bathroom to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act. A small parking lot was placed behind the cottage so as to not impede street views. The Mill Gardiner mill and cottage 20180916 The Gardiner Mill, built in 1804, is a New England style smock windmill built by Millwright Nathanial Dominy V. and operated as a grist mill serving area farmers. The timber used for the mill was cut from trees on Gardiner's Island and it was finished on September 28, 1804, costing more than 528 pounds ($28,208 in 2018). The mill continued to operate until 1900 and retained much of its original machinery, it has the best representation of colonial style interior finish of the extant Long Island windmills and remains the best example of millwrighting craftsmanship by Nathaniel Dominy V, who also worked on other area windmills. Nathaniel Dominy is said to have given particular attention to detail in the workings of the Gardiner Mill frame and had worked the timbers to a smooth finish with a hand plane. Dominy made this extra effort partly due to this being the first of a kind, a new model windmill which was crafted to run two sets of millstones instead of one, and also because he built it for his major patron, John Lyon Gardiner. It was completely renovated in 1996 by the Village which created a state-of-the-art restoration of the Windmill.

History  At the start of the 1930s, a programme was launched for the south of the 16th arrondissement to build a new lyc√©e for boys, and a new a lyc√©e for girls (the latter being the Lyc√©e La Fontaine (Paris)). The lyc√©e Claude-Bernard was originally conceived for 1200 students in 50 classes.Jean Favier, La Construction moderne, n¬∞15 and 16, 5 and 12 February 1939. Built in 1937 on a large area of open ground, and inaugurated on 16 June 1938 in the presence of Minister of National Education Jean Zay, it was originally intended as a lyc√©e for boys based particularly on literature, sciences and arts.¬´ Pr√©sentation de l'√©tablissement ¬ª, ac- paris.fr. Retrieved 16 April 2016. In Paris in World War II, between 17 June 1940 and 23 August 1944, the lyc√©e was requisitioned and transformed into a barracks for SS troops. The soldiers undertook military exercises in close proximity, in Parc des Princes. A bunker was also built in the basement of the lyc√©e, containing an infirmary; it now serves as the school's archives. The students were transferred to lyc√©e Janson-de-Sailly and the accommodation was used by Germans from April 1942, giving compensation, but also causing theft and damage. After the Liberation of Paris, the lyc√©e was occupied by American soldiers of the 2nd Armored Division (France) led by Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque. A commemorative plaque in the hall of the lyc√©e recalls the memory of eight Jewish students deported and another of the 23 students and teachers who gave their lives for France.

It opens onto a round hall (with mural decoration by Ma√Ætre Ernest Denis, member of the Insititute) which allows access to the central recreation courtyard (the buildings run along the road, a central access corridor allows access to the interior courtyard, while students were originally overlooking the courtyard so that they would not be distracted by outside noise on the road or sporting exercises taking place at the stadium of Parc des Princes), the four staircases serving the lyc√©e and administrative buildings. In the courtyard, the door for the hall is overlooked by a wrought iron clock. There is a library, an amphitheatre, two courtyards, and two gymnasiums. The classrooms are on four floors, and offices are on the fifth. A service entrance can be found on the corner of rue Lecomte-Du-Nou√ø and boulevard Murat and another smaller entrance on rue de l'Arioste. The frame of the building is made of reinforced concrete. The ground floor is covered in Saint-Maximin stone covered in Bagneux, with steps in Sept-Monts stone and pink bricks and stone courtyard in Boulaye stone. The roof, some floors, and two turrets are made of slate. There is also a covered terrace for the surplus. Image:D√©tail porte lyc√©e Claude-Bernard 1.jpgMain door (left).

It is based on SNK's video game with the same title. Originally divided in two versions in China, ComicsOne published the two series combined in North America. The plot of the series follows a new fighting tournament whose sponsors appear to be related with the legendary creature known as Yamata no Orochi and multiple combatants are summoned to investigate it. The comics generally focus of the reluctant hero K' and the mysterious newcomer Ash Crimson. Critical reception to the manhua has been mixed. While the art and translation were praised for the way fight scenes are drawn, the lack of backstories for most characters were criticized as casual readers would not understand who are them. Nevertheless, the final issues were well received for the way the plot was handled. Plot The plot begins with a fight between K', a teenager with pyrokinectic abilities facing a clone from the fighters Kyo Kusanagi. Following K' victory, a woman named Chizuru Kagura revives the clone and renames him \\"Kusanagi\\". Shortly afterwards, Kagura is attacked by an unknown opponent and a new fighting tournament known as \\"The King of Fighters\\" is announced. A young man named Ash Crimson also capable of producing flame starts forming his own team with Shen Woo and Duo Lon, but forms multiple enemies in the process with another clone of Kyo attacking him in one moment. However, Ash defeats him. The original Kyo Kusanagi is summoned by Chizuru alongside his rival Iori Yagami for a mission: Chizuru senses the power of the legendary creature Yamata no Orochi stronger and requests their aid to oversee the tournament behind the shadows to learn if the sponsor is related to Orochi. While Kyo and Iori accept the mission, K' and his friends Maxima and Whip are requested by the elder Chin Gentsai to participate in the tournament for a similar mission with K' undergoing new training in the process. As the tournament starts, Ash's and K's teams become one of the leading competitors. The final is a fight between Ash's team and K's. While Ash take the upperhand, K' wins the final battle due to a time limit. Shortly afterwards, K' is kidnapped by the sponsors Adelheid and Rose Bernstein. K' faces Adelheid but the two are separated in the area's destruction. Kyo and Iori are then betrayed by Chizuru who attacks them alongside her twin sister Maki Kagura. As Kyo and Iori defeat the Kagura sisters, it is revealed Maki is an undead fighter revived unintentionally Chizuru's power, the Yata Mirror. Chizuru had been brainwashed by Botan, a woman from an organization known as \\"Those From the Past\\". Kyo and Iori are then attacked by Botan's superior, Mukai, who also kills Kusanagi while the clone attempts to save Chizuru. K' faces Mukai and uses the power of Orochi to defeat him alongside Ash's help. Following Mukai's escape, Ash attacks Chizuru, and steals the Yata Mirror, promising Iori to be his next victim. A frustrated K' reunites with his friends as he remains taunted by Mukai. Publication In China the series was divided into two halves: The King of Fighters 2003 composed of five issues, and The King of Fighters 03: Xenon Zero (Êã≥Áöá XENON ZERO) composed of eight issues. The two series were combined for the North American release under the name of The King of Fighters 2003. In July 2004, ComicsOne licensed the series with its first volume tying the release of a new video game and kept publishing it after their transition to DrMaster. They were published in five issues of 128 pages from May 25, 2005 to June 26, 2008. *Volume 1: May 25, 2005 *Volume 2: September 25, 2005 *Volume 3: January 25, 2006 *Volume 4: March 28, 2008 *Volume 5: June 26, 2008 Reception The comic has received positive mixed critical responses. Atomicavanue enjoyed the way fights were displayed as due to how faithful they are to their video game incarnation citing Kyo Kusanagi's moves as an example. Karl Lam from Comic Book Bin agreed, feeling the artwork was good in general and the translation from Chinese to English was well executed. Since the reviewed first issue was mostly centered around the characters' introduction, Lam noticed there was not many interactions. However, he gave the comic an overall score of 9 out of 10. In a more critical review, IGN was bothered by the new main character, Ash Crimson, feeling he was not as appealing other characters based on his characterization and also found it issues in the lack of backstories of the cast. Nevertheless, IGN felt the comic might be suitable for The King of Fighters and agreed the fight scenes were also enjoyable. A similar response in regards to the storyline was given by Genji Press' Serdar Yegulalp in regards to whether fans of the franchise might enjoy the comic more than casual readers. While praising the fight scenes, Yegulalp felt Ash would not come as very likable and that the relationships between characters like K' and Maxima were left in mystery to casuals. In contrast to the negative review from the initial review, IGN found the fourth issue of the story more enjoyable based on the characters' fight scenes, as well as the fact that the story's tournament is not the end of the story because of the sponsor hiding something which might surprise the readers. IGN also enjoyed how the characters were given their unique traits such as Ash's \\"jerkass\\" attittude or K's heroic personality. In general, IGN found the manwhua more enjoyable than the adaptation of the game SVC Chaos: SNK vs. Capcom. In a review of the final volume, Ben Leary from Mania Entertainment said that while the battle sequences were appealing, some of them did not have a satisfying conclusion or were not elaborated well such as the final fight between K' and Mukai due to how the former is found in a conflict related to Japanese mythology while some scenes felt repetitive. Giving the final issue a C+, Leary that while the comic tried giving coherency to the plot, it failed to do it.

It consists of five interlocking segments released online between 2015 and 2017, with a video-on-demand and physical release in 2018. The series revolves around the Halloween season and each episode pays tribute to a different genre of horror. Individual episodes screened at multiple film festivals, such as ScareLA, Puerto Rico Horror Film Fest, Fright Night Film Fest, Utah Film Awards, The Halloween International Film Festival, Filmquest and several others.  Production  In 2015, Michael Ballif approached fellow filmmakers James Morris, Allen Bradford, and Parker Marcroft about developing a horror anthology centered around the Halloween season. The series intro was released online and garnered attention from sites like CraveOnline. Production began early that year on the pilot episode (\\"Killer on the Loose\\"), with Ballif writing and directing. After the pilot's release, Morris took over as writer and director on the next two episodes (\\"Princess\\" and \\"Not Alone\\") while Ballif began developing what would become the longest episode of the series (\\"They Live Inside Us\\"). After its completion, Morris returned to helm the final installment (\\"Is That You?\\"). The entire anthology was filmed in Northern Utah with a small crew running all aspects of the production. The series was scored by composer Randin Graves, with David Monastiere (Slasher Dave) composing the intro, and co-composing Episode #4: \\"They Live Inside Us\\". Ballif and Morris decided to end the anthology after the fifth episode in order to focus on the production of their first feature film, however, an official second season is said to be in early-stage development.  Cast   Release  The Witching Season was originally released as a YouTube web-series starting in 2015 and continuing through 2017 (as the individual episodes were produced and released one at a time). The series later received a video-on- demand release through Amazon Prime as well as a physical Blu-ray/DVD release through Scream Team Releasing in September 2018.  Reception  The Witching Season received generally positive reviews, particularly among fans of the horror genre. Loron Hays, writing for Reel Reviews, said \\"complete with a moody opening sequence that resembles Haddonfield, Illinois from John Carpenter‚Äôs Halloween, works due to its service of familiar horror tropes. Horror fans will enjoy the tip of the hat.\\" and gave the series a 4 out of 5 rating. Bryan Fitzgerald, writing for Fitz of Horror said \\"These inspired Halloween tales are perfect for late nights with friends and well worth adding to our collection.\\" Ken Artuz of Decay Mag, said \\"The Witching Season offers the nostalgic approach to the Horror anthology concept.\\" Mike Sprague, writing for Dread Central, said \\"I took to Ballif‚Äôs indie-series immediately. And I think you will too.\\" Ray Marek of The Horror Syndicate called the series \\"very good\\" and gave it a 7 out of 10 rating. Matt Artz of Halloween Dailey said the series was \\"a wickedly atmospheric celebration of everything we love about Halloween.\\"  Future episodes  Directors Michael Ballif and James Morris have both stated they want to continue The Witching Season, and it is rumored that an official second season could go into production sometime in 2020.  Feature film adaptation  In October 2017, it was announced that the fourth episode of the series, They Live Inside Us would be adapted into a feature film, with James Morris once again playing the lead and Michael Ballif acting as writer and director. The film was released on October the, 2020.

He was obliged to resign his chair either because it was discovered that he secretly professed the Greek Orthodox faith, or because of his mental illness - he is said to have had daily visions of saints. Coresio was one of the group described scornfully by Galileo as the 'Pigeon League' of Aristotelian philosophers, associated with Lodovico delle Colombe. Galileo argued for an approach which he described as 'pluming the wings [i.e. of natural philosophy] with the feathers of mathematics, without which it is impossible to rise even an arm's measure above the earth'. Traditional scholars objected to the mixing of mathematics with the established forms of scholarly speculation and argument. Coresio described this approach as one which was 'full of radical change, and represented all things in the universe under different faces'. Dispute about floating bodies Coresio is most noted for his dispute with Galileo over the question of how solid bodies float in water. In the summer of 1611, at the house of Filippo Salviati, a scholarly disagreement began about the nature of cold. Coresio took part in this discussion, together with Vincenzo di Grazia, maintaining the traditional Aristotelian view that ice was denser than water, only floating because of its shape. Galileo, in contrast, argued that ice floated precisely because it was less dense than water. Coresio's contribution to this dispute was his 1612 work Operetta intorno al Galleggiare de Corpi Solidi (Short Essay on the Floating of Solid Bodies). Galileo, working together with Benedetto Castelli, put together a reply under the heading of Errori pi√π manifesti commessi da Messer Giorgio Coresio (The most obvious errors committed by Mr. Giorgio Coresio). This work was never published however as by 1613 when it was ready, Galileo's attention had been diverted to defending himself against many other hostile essays published by associates of delle Colombe. By 1614, signs of Coresio's mental health problems had become clear, and this may be another reason why Galileo never published his response. Dispute about falling bodies Another extended dispute involving Galileo and Coresio was over falling bodies - specifically whether heavier bodies fell faster than lighter ones (as Aristotle claimed) or whether they fell at the same rate (as Galileo maintained). It was a common belief in the past that Galileo had conducted an experiment by dropping objects of different weights from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to prove his point, but he never claimed to have done so and it is now considered doubtful that he did. On the other hand Coresio did claim to have done this experiment himself, and to have thereby proved Aristotle's view. Other The encyclical of Benedict XIV Ex Quo (1756) announced an authorised version of Greek prayers for adherents to the Melkite Greek Catholic Church. It cited Giorgio Coresio as one of the ' outstanding scholars and experts in Greek affairs' who were consulted when an earlier edition of the prayers (Euchologion) was produced.

History =1930s= The New York City Teachers Union (TU) had experience conflict internally for more of the early 1930s. The opposing groups were the founders (Henry Linville and Abraham Lefkowitz‚Äìat the time called \\"administrators\\") and \\"Rank and File\\" members (many of whom were also Communist Party members). During an August 1935 national convention, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) voted down a TU administrators' request to reorganize (100 to 79). On October 1, 1935, Linville and Lefkowitz led all officers, nearly all executive board members, and nearly 800 members (including Communist Lovestoneite members of a rival \\"Progressive Group\\") out of the TU to form the Teachers Guild (TG). =1940s= On March 29, 1940, the New York State Legislature formed the \\"Rapp-Coudert Committee\\" to investigate finances (Rapp in the New York State Assembly) and subversive activities (Coudert in the New York State Senate). From September 1940 through December 1941, Coudert investigated more than 500 people regarding their affiliation with the Communist Party USA. Coudert's subcommittee focused on the TU Local 5 as well as a college professors union Local 537. Former TU leaders who had helped found the TG, Henry Linville and Benjamin Mandel, testified against TU members. On June 20, 1941, the AFT designated the TG as \\"Local 2, AFT.\\" On December 29, 1940, the AFT voted and in May 1941 officially expelled three communist-influenced locals: the TU (Local 5, AFT), the New York College Teachers Union (Local 537, AFT), and the Philadelphia Teachers Union (Local 192, AFT). In June 1941, the AFT made the TG its \\"Local 5, AFT\\" in New York City. In 1943, the Rapp-Coudert Committee endorsed school financing policies of the TG. =1950s= (Forthcoming) =1960= In March 1960, the TG and Committee of Action Through Unity (CATU) merged into the United Federation of Teachers (Local 2, AFT). In August 1960, New York's Board of Education and the UFT conducted initial collective bargaining. People The TU was a client of Harold I. Cammer. =Presidents= All TG presidents were former members of the TU: # Henry Linville # Albert Smallheiser # Rebecca Simonson # Charles Cogen =Leaders= * Ben Davidson (politician) * Layle Lane * David Selden Assessment In 2015, Nicholas Toloudis attributed the demise of the TU not only to Red Scares in the 1940s and 1950s but also to competition with other city teachers associations. In particular, the TG was \\"accommodating to the government, while the radical Union was confrontational\\" and \\"consistently sacrificed its commitment to academic freedom by collaborating with public authorities\\" to reveal TU ties to the CPUSA.

It was recorded in July 1976 under the supervision of musicologist Ren√© L√≥pez, who was responsible for organizing the sessions. The LP was released in 1977 by Salsoul to critical acclaim. The songs included in the release are in the descarga format, i.e. improvised jam sessions, and were performed by a predominantly Cuban lineup featuring trumpeter Alfredo \\"Chocolate\\" Armenteros, percussionist Carlos \\"Patato\\" Vald√©s and flautist Gonzalo Fern√°ndez, among others. Considered Cachao's \\"comeback album\\", it was followed by Dos, which was recorded during the same sessions.

A contemporary review published on the Stereo Review magazine classified it as a \\"recording of special merit\\" and rated the performance as \\"superb\\" and the recording quality as \\"good\\". It highlighted Cachao's role as an innovator in Cuban music, comparing him to Duke Ellington. The Downbeat Magazine review highlighted the high quality of the performers describing those on side A (tracks 1 and 2) as \\"the finest interpreters of pure Afro-Cuban music in the U.S.\\", and those on tracks 3 and 4 as \\"the leading exponents of the modern charanga\\".

It is a genus of small fishes which vary in length from and and which live in shallow coral flats or around heads of coral. They have elongated pelvic fins and the other fins are marked with colourful patterns such as stripes and these give name to the common names \\"longfin\\" and \\"prettyfin\\". They are thought to be nocturnal and are infrequently seen in the wild. They are carnivorous and their diet is made up of crustaceans, gastropods and small fishes and sometimes on brittle stars. A defining characteristic of this genus is that they lay elongated eggs which are laid under rocks or overhangs and are guarded by the male. Species The following species are currently recognised within the genus Plesiops: * Plesiops auritus * Plesiops cephalotaenia * Plesiops coeruleolineatus * Plesiops corallicola * Plesiops facicavus * Plesiops genaricus * Plesiops gracilis * Plesiops insularis * Plesiops malalaxus * Plesiops multisquamata * Plesiops mystaxus * Plesiops nakaharae * Plesiops nigricans * Plesiops oxycephalus * Plesiops polydactylus * Plesiops thysanopterus * Plesiops verecundus References Category:Plesiopinae ","title":"Plesiops"},{"id":"58608868","text":"Arthur William Newman (15 September 1883 ‚Äì 16 March 1966) was an English first-class cricketer.

It categorises legal studies on copyright so as to inform the public and policy development based on evidence. It was setup and run by CREATe at the University of Glasgow.  History  Copyright Evidence was established in 2014 by Theo Koutmeridis, Kris Erickson, and Martin Kretschmer, as a project undertaken by the CREATe research centre. The project aims to be a consolidated and interdisciplinary ‚Äúcentral source‚Äù for evidence- based copyright studies, where users can examine findings and methodology transparently. An editorial board was established in December 2017, which included the appointment of a sub-editor responsible for growing the existing base of studies.  Methodology  Initial studies eligible for Copyright Evidence were identified using a snowball sampling methodology, beginning with a literature review by Watson, Zizzo and Fleming. Thereafter: 103 working papers and pre-prints were identified through the SSRN e-journal Intellectual Property: Empirical Studies (published between November 1996 and July 2015); 81 studies via literature reviews by Handke, Kretschmer, and Kheria; and 50 governmental reports as proposed by CREATe doctoral candidates. Ongoing growth of Copyright Evidence is achieved by search-based identifications. A literature review, conducted by the University of Illinois, confirmed the veracity and comprehensiveness of Copyright Evidence in late-2018.  Format  Copyright Evidence catalogues all ‚Äúempirical studies on copyright in an attempt to inform policy interventions based on rigorous evidence‚Äù. Permitted studies may also include multi-disciplinary elements, and do not need to be strictly legal in nature. Copyright Evidence is currently closed for unauthenticated user submissions, with relevant studies being identified and coded by a community of CREATe research assistants. Each entry details the main findings of the relevant study, a description of the data involved, and relevant policy considerations. Studies are also categorised (amongst other factors) by country, JEL code, and research method. Iconographic indicators are used to identify the relevant industry, fundamental issues, and policy areas.  Findings  Copyright Evidence currently holds details of over 600 evidence-based studies on copyright, and acts as a dynamic literature review platform which is open to text and data mining. Mining and visualisation tools were explored during the 2016 EUHackathon, which identified certain clusters of cross-referencing between key related studies. Governmental reports, for example, tend to cross-reference other governmental reports, but less so academic evidence on copyright. Copyright Evidence visualisations provide summary statistics on the landscape of the indexed studies. These demonstrate how the majority of copyright studies focus on: (a) the sound recording and music publishing industry; (b) understanding consumption/use (e.g. determinants of unlawful behaviour, user-generated content, social media), and; (c) enforcement (quantifying infringement, criminal sanctions, intermediary liability, graduated response, litigation & court data, commercial VS non-commercial, education & awareness). Copyright Evidence is cited as a resource to support the use of empirical evidence in informing copyright policy.CopyrightAgency (2015) Submission to Productivity Commission Intellectual Property Arrangements Issues Paper (November 2015) at p13European Commission (2012) Evaluation of the application of Regulation 386/2012 Final Report at p36  References  Category:University of Glasgow Category:Copyright law Category:Wiki communities ","title":"Copyright Evidence"},{"id":"58608926","text":"The 1995 Yale Bulldogs football team represented Yale University in the 1995 NCAA Division I-AA football season.

He is currently the Chairman of the Union of Officers of Moldova and was also the Secretary of the Supreme Security Council and two time Moldovan Minister of Defense. Biography A pronunciation of Gaiciuc's name by Voice of America. Victor Gaiciuc was born on 12 March 1957 in the village of Pepeni, in the S√Ængerei District of the Moldovan SSR. He graduated from the Kharkov Air Defense High School (now the Ivan Kozhedub National Air Force University) in 1978 and then studied at the Lenin Military-Political Academy from 1986‚Äì1989, later obtaining the scientific title of Doctor of Historical Sciences. In between that time, he was pilot of the Soviet Air Force, commanding aviation regiments in Ukraine and Belarus. After graduating in 1989, he became responsible for training personnel in the Belarusian Military District. In 1993, Gaiciuc returned to the newly independent Republic of Moldova, where he is appointed as a chief specialist in the Ministry of Defense. On June 3, 1997, he was appointed Deputy Minister of Defense, responsible for staff training, military legislation and international relations. That same year, he began to take courses at the NATO College in Rome. He was removed from his position on 7 April 1999, becoming a commissioner in the ministry and serving in that position for one year.

In early 2004, he awarded 3 Moldovan soldiers serving in Iraq with the Medal of Merit. He was dismissed from office on 15 October 2004 by presidential decree after the Supreme Security Council made an appeal for his dismissal, criticizing his work in the defense ministry and finding him respnsible for the theft of arms. =Diplomatic career= On 12 January 2005, Gaiciuc was appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Moldova to the Kingdom of Belgium and concurrently Representative of the country to NATO. He held these positions for close a year before additionally becoming the ambassador of Moldova to the Netherlands, residing in Brussels. =Adviser to President Dodon= He was appointed to the post of Supreme Security Council Secretary in August 2019, succeeding Artur Gameniuc who was transferred to the Information and Security Service of the Republic of Moldova.https://sis.md/en/conducerea/artur-gumeniuc?status=1 On 2 September, he met with Secretary of the Security Council of Russia Nikolai Patrushev in Moscow where he was invited to attend an annual meeting between the secretaries of the security councils of CIS member states in Moscow. In stating what his mandate would look like, he vowed to \\"direct my efforts to further promote patriotic values\\". In February 2019, he was elected to the Moldovan Parliament. In his official position as advisor, he accompanied Dodon during the 2020 Moscow Victory Day Parade.https://m.ru.sputnik.md/society/20200626/30734964/general-gaychuk-o- parade-v-moskve-nashi-proshli-dostoyno-po-krasnoy- ploschadi.html?mobile_return=no Two weeks earlier, he had been ordered by Dodon to see off the Moldovan contingent participating in the parade at the airport.https://esp.md/sobytiya/2020/06/14/moldavskie-voennye-otpravilis-v- moskvu-oni-primut-uchastie-v-parade-pobedy =Defence Minister (2019‚Äì2020)= He was appointer by Prime Minister Ion Chicu to lead the new technocratic government following the collapse of the Sandu Cabinet led by Prime Minister Maia Sandu, who was ousted in a vote of no confidence after a disagreement with the co-governing Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova. He was handed the banner of the defense ministry by President Dodon from his predecessor Pavel Voicu on 14 November. In an interview, he deflected concerns about a relationship with Dodon, stating that \\"service and personal relationships are two different things\\". In early 2020, Gaiciuc signed an agreement with Bishop Vladimir (Cantarean) of the Moldovan Orthodox Church on religious cooperation with the Moldovan National Army.https://www.army.md/?lng=3&action;=show&cat;=122&obj;=6223 Around the same time, he oversaw the creation of the National Council for War Veterans Affairs, an association which he is the president of.https://www.army.md/?lng=3&action;=show&cat;=122&obj;=6140 He was dismissed on 16 March 2020, being replaced by Alexandru P√Ænzari.

During the First World War, he served as a fighter pilot and was decorated for home defence in southern England against German attacks from planes and Zeppelins. While a pilot with No. 60 Squadron, Ridley landed in occupied France and, despite being taken prisoner, he escaped and spent several weeks on the run before returning to England via the Netherlands. Early life Ridley was born in Sunderland on 15 November 1897, and was the youngest of seven children. He grew up in the suburb of Fulwell in the city, but by the age of 11, the family were living in Notting Hill in London. First World War At the start of the First World War, Ridley was offered a temporary commission into the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), but on being granted a full commission, he entered Sandhurst and passed out as an officer in the Royal Fusiliers. He did, however, keep up with his flying and was transferred into the RFC in July 1915. After transferring from the Royal Fusiliers, Ridley was allocated to No. 3 Squadron and was wounded in action on the Western Front in 1916. His foot was injured and, as a result, he could not fly having to convalesce in England. He was awarded the Military Cross for his action in downing a Zeppelin in 1916 while flying from Joyce Green. When No. 60 Squadron was formed in April 1916, Ridley was one of the initial pilots drafted to the squadron. While ferrying a spy into territory behind enemy lines to the French town of Douai in August 1916, the aircraft Ridley was flying broke down. As he and his passenger were trying to get the aircraft going, German military personnel heard them and detained them. They were questioned but managed to escape quite quickly. Ridley hid whilst the spy brought him some civilian attire and then left Ridley to fend for himself. Whilst he was hiding, Ridley observed the German pilots flying their aircraft and even witnessed a British aircraft crash landing and its pilot and observer being marched off by the Germans for interrogation. Ridley managed to make his way across France and into Belgium before returning to England through the Netherlands. Whilst on his journey, he made notes and gathered intelligence about the German forces and delivered these to his superiors when he returned. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and was mentioned in the London Gazette which said \\"For conspicuous gallantry and judgement in the execution of a special mission.\\" At the end of the war, an assessment of battle casualties on No. 60 Squadron determined that 115 pilots and observers had been either wounded, taken prisoner, were missing or had been killed. Ridley was the only one to escape captivity on the squadron and he is recorded as being back in Britain by the 13 October 2016, some two months after his aircraft failed on the field in France. Due to his high-profile involvement in ferrying spies, it was decided to withdraw Ridley from active operations over the front line in case he had to land in occupied territory again and be shot as a spy. Instead he was sent to head up B-Flight from No. 37 Squadron at Stow Maries Aerodrome. At this point, Ridley was a 19-year old lieutenant in charge of a new squadron. Whilst there, he was among many who launched their fighters to defend the south and east of England against attack from Gotha bombers and Zeppelin raids. In one such event, British anti-aircraft batteries located along the Thames Estuary confused the 37 Squadron Sopwith Pups with enemy aircraft and opened fire upon them. Ridley, like many others, was hit and had his engine cowling blown off at , and had to make an emergency landing at Rochford. Ridley was particularly galled by this because only a day earlier, he had flown his aircraft over the batteries so that the artillery men could see the outline of his aircraft and hear the noise of his engine. Ridley then took command of the newly formed No. 61 Squadron at Rochford in the summer of 1917, before taking command of No. 112 Squadron at Throwley in December of the same year. In the late stages of the war he commanded No. 28 Squadron at Grossa in Italy before returning to command No. 75 Squadron in England. When No. 75 Squadron was disbanded in 1919, Ridley became the commander of No. 39 Squadron. Later life Ridley was promoted to the rank of squadron leader in January 1925 and, in June of the same year, he married Lillias Elizabeth McAlpine, the daughter of Sir Robert McAlpine; they had three children together. He left the Air Force soon after and was on the retired list by 1928, although he was recalled in 1939 on the outbreak of the Second World War. During the Second World War, he served as a Wing Commander in various appointments including Leeds University Air Squadron. Death Ridley died in the Dorchester Hotel in Mayfair, London on 27 June 1942. His death was attributed to natural causes rather than a circumstance of the war. His wish to be buried near to Stow Maries aerodrome was granted, and like many others who had served at Stow Maries, his grave is located in the churchyard of St Mary and St Margaret's Church in the village. Commemorations The home that Ridley lived in during his family's time in Sunderland had a blue plaque affixed to the wall in 2016. Military Cadet organisations in the area of Essex around the former Stow Maries Aerodrome, compete in the Ridley Trophy competition annually by vying for timings on an assault course.

She is the author of The Poet X, With the Fire on High and Clap When You Land. The Poet X is a New York Times Bestseller, National Book Award Winner, and Carnegie Medal winner. She is also the winner of the 2018 Michael L. Printz Award, the 2018 Pura Belpre Award, and the Boston-Globe Hornbook Award Prize for Best Children‚Äôs Fiction of 2018. She lives in Washington, DC.  Early life and education  Acevedo was born of Dominican immigrants and raised in New York. She grew up in the predominantly Dominican, Puerto Rican, and religiously catholic neighborhood of Morningside Heights. She is the youngest child and only daughter. By the age of 12, Elizabeth decided she wanted to be a rapper, but then quickly realized what she really wanted to do was perform poetry. She then attended the Beacon School, where she met English teacher Abby Lublin. Here, Lublin recruited Acevedo to join her after school poetry club to further improve her work. At the age of 14, she competed on her first poetry slam at the Nuyorican Poets Caf√©, and then participated in open mics around the city, in such as venues Bowery Poetry Club and Urban Word NYC. She earned a Bachelor of Arts in Performing Arts at George Washington University by designing her own degree using courses in performing arts, English, and Sociology. She then earned a M.F.A. in Creative Writing at the University of Maryland and served as an adjunct professor for bachelor level creative writing courses. Elizabeth Acevedo was teaching eighth grade in Prince George's County when she was coaxing a specific student to read more, and when she asked her students as to why they weren't reading, the response she got was, \\"These books aren't about us.‚Äô‚Äô Acevedo realized her students were affected by the lack of diversity in their books and not her capabilities. Acevedo was influenced to buy books that her students could relate to, when she realized that she had the power to write such books too. Personal life Acevedo identifies as Afro-Latina. Although raised Catholic, she no longer practices the religion. Currently, she lives in Washington, D.C. with her partner. Acevedo grew up in a conservative and devout household of Catholicism. She went to church every Sunday with her mother and participated in every sacrament. Acevedo doesn't practice her religion anymore, though she still considers her relationship with her religion to be developing. She questions the teaching of religion because she says her book With the Fire on High is influenced by the fact that religion is empowering but \\"sometimes makes women and young girls question their selves\\".  Career  Following graduation from George Washington University, Acevedo went into the classroom as a 2010 Teach for America Corps participant. She continued on to teach eighth grade English in Prince George‚Äôs County, Maryland. Although the population of the town was 78% Latinx and 20% Black, she was the first Latinx teacher to teach a core subject. She is a previous National Slam Champion, as well as former head coach for the D.C. Youth Slam Team. She has performed at Lincoln Center, Madison Square Garden, the Kennedy Center of the Performing Arts, South Africa‚Äôs State Theatre, Bozar in Brussels, and the National Library of Kosovo. She has also delivered several TED Talks, and her masterful poetry videos have been featured in Latina Magazine, Cosmopolitan,the Huffington Post, and Upworthy. She is also the author of three young adult novels. Beastgirl and Other Origin Myths was published in 2016 and was a finalist for YesYes Chapbook Prize. The Poet X is a New York Times Bestseller. The novel also won the 2018 Boston Globe‚ÄìHorn Book Award, the Walter Dean Myers Awards for Outstanding Children‚Äôs Literature in the Teen category, the Michael L. Printz Award, and the 2018 National Book Award for Young People's Literature. It was a finalist for the Kirkus Prize. The book highlights the struggles of growing up as a Latinx girl dealing with her sexuality and religion, and finding her own voice. With the Fire on High is Acevedo's third novel, released in May 2019. Her fourth, Clap When You Land, has been accepted for publication. It is about two sisters who grow up unaware of each other while living in different countries but who learn of each other after their father dies. Acevedo is both a CantoMundo fellow and Cave Canem fellow. Her poems have appeared or are forthcoming from Poetry, Puerto Del Sol, Callaloo, and The Notre Dame Review, among others. She also works as a visiting instructor at an adjudicated youth center in Washington, DC, where she works with incarcerated women and with teenagers. Critical response Kirkus Reviews describes Poet X as ‚ÄúPoignant and real; beautiful & intense.‚Äù Cleyvis Natera's review of Poet X for Aster(ix) Journal relates to the main character, Xiomara. Natera writes that Poet X is relatable to teenage girls dealing with their first love and strict parents that just don't understand, and who are finding themselves or growing into the person that they‚Äôre meant to be. She urges its readers to buy the book.

It was published by Xbox Game Studios. It is a spin-off of Minecraft and was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One on May 26, 2020. The game received mixed reviews; many deemed the game fun and charming, with praise for its visuals and music. However, its simple gameplay and use of procedural generation were met with a more mixed reception, with its short story and lack of depth criticized. Gameplay Unlike Minecraft, Minecraft Dungeons doesn't feature an open world, nor mining or building. Instead, it is a hack and slash-styled dungeon crawler, rendered from an isometric perspective. Players explore procedurally generated and hand crafted dungeons filled with randomly-generated monsters and also deal with traps, puzzles, bosses and finding treasure. There is no class system; players can use any weapon or armor they wish. The game includes a four-player local and online multiplayer.  Synopsis  Minecraft Dungeons is set in the same fictional world as Minecraft, known as the \\"Overworld\\", consisting of rough 3D objects‚Äîmainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called \\"blocks\\"‚Äîrepresenting various materials, and inhabited by both peaceful and hostile mobs. Unlike Minecraft, the game features a linear, story-driven campaign, and cutscenes. The opening cutscene tells the story of an Illager named Archie, who was driven away by his people. While searching for a new home, he was forced to leave every village he found due to Villagers not allowing him to live with them. One day, Archie stumbled upon a powerful artifact known as the \\"Orb of Dominance\\", which granted him magic powers, but also corrupted him. Now known as the \\"Arch-Illager\\", he sought vengeance on all those who wronged him, and subjugated numerous villages with his new army. Players assume the role of heroes who embark on a quest to defeat the Arch-Illager, while liberating villages, fighting monsters, and completing various quests to pass on to the next level. Ultimately, the players face the Arch-Illager in his castle, destroying the Orb of Dominance in the process, which frees Archie from its influence. While he is afraid of them at first, the players instead befriend him, showing him that there are also kind people in the Overworld. As the players and Archie depart, the Orb is shown to be rebuilding itself. In the Jungle Awakens expansion pack, it is revealed a shard of the Orb went into a jungle, corrupting the nearby land and creating a monstrosity known as the \\"Jungle Abomination\\", which the player(s) must defeat. Development Dungeons is developed by Mojang Studios for Xbox One, Windows 10, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch using Unreal Engine 4. Console ports are being done by Double Eleven. With the continued success of the original Minecraft, Mojang thought about other possible games that could bring something new to the Minecraft universe. Experimenting with different ideas, the game was originally meant to be a single-player dungeon crawl game, inspired by The Legend of Zelda series, for the Nintendo 3DS. However, as the game began to take shape, these elements were changed or removed. For example, after adding in multiplayer features, the development team realized that these changes made the game more fun. According to game director M√•ns Olsen, the game was inspired by Diablo and Torchlight, as well as co-operative first-person shooter games like Warhammer: End Times ‚Äì Vermintide and Left 4 Dead. One of the primary challenges the development team faced was figuring out how to adapt the gameplay of dungeon crawl games like Diablo into the world of Minecraft. Since Minecraft characters did not have any special innate abilities, Mojang had to think of alternatives to things such as character class that would normally be found in games of that genre. Their solution was to focus on creating weapons and armor that the player could make more powerful through enchantments, allowing the player to explore their creativity through customization. In addition, Mojang wanted to streamline the traditional dungeon crawl game experience into something more accessible. Olsen remarked that other games in the genre \\"are approachable to some degree, but they're typically games with very deep, interconnected systems\\", and that they wanted to make getting into Minecraft Dungeons \\"super easy\\" yet \\"instantly familiar\\". The decision to not allow building or crafting, a staple of the original Minecraft, was also made in order to focus on the core dungeon-crawling experience. To give more experienced players a challenge, the team added options to change the game's difficulty, which would reward players with better equipment and new secret content for playing on harder difficulties. Minecraft Dungeons was first announced on September 28, 2018 during the Minecon live streaming event. A video showcasing gameplay was released during E3 2019. Release Minecraft Dungeons was released on May 26, 2020, after being delayed from its original April release date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The closed beta for the game ran for a month from March 25 to April 24, 2020.  Downloadable Content  , there are 2 DLC packs released. The DLC can be bought separately for players who don't own the \\"Hero Edition\\" of the game. = Jungle Awakens = On June 26, 2020, Mojang announced the first DLC pack, Jungle Awakens, and it was released on July 1, 2020. The update includes new weapons, items, and artifacts. = Creeping Winter = On July 11, 2020, the second DLC pack, Creeping Winter, was announced. It was released on September 8, 2020. = Howling Peaks = On October 3, 2020, it was confirmed that a 3rd DLC pack, Howling Peaks, was ready for release in December. Like the previous two DLCs, Howling Peaks introduces new artifacts as well as both original mobs and mobs from the original game, as well as a new game mechanic, wind. Reception Minecraft Dungeons received mixed reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Critics generally found the game fun and charming, complimenting its visuals and music. Some were divided on Dungeons simplicity and the procedural generation system used to generate loot and dungeon layouts. Most reviewers were critical of the game's short story mode and perceived lack of depth. Shacknews called it \\"a fun, laid back dungeon crawler for friends to get into.\\" =Sales= The Hero Edition of Minecraft Dungeons sold 11,450 physical copies on the Nintendo Switch within its first week on sale in Japan, making it the fourth bestselling retail game of the week in the country. Legacy Three music tracks from this game, Halland, Dalarna, and The Arch- Illager, are featured as downloadable content in the 2018 crossover fighting game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, with the former two being rearranged into a single medley. These songs were added to the game on October 13, 2020 as part of Challenger Pack 7, which features content from Minecraft franchise including the default skins Steve and Alex as playable fighters and a new stage based on randomly generated Minecraft biomes.https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v;=_Sp5o1JJdDk References External links * Category:2020 video games Category:Dungeon crawler video games Category:Hack and slash role-playing games Category:Microsoft games Category:Minecraft Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Video games developed in Sweden Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games using procedural generation Category:Video games postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Video games with downloadable content Category:Video games with isometric graphics Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games ","title":"Minecraft Dungeons"},{"id":"58609110","text":":for the Cistercian abbey in Girals see Beaulieu-en-Rouergue Abbey; for the cheese see Abbaye de Belloc The abbey Belloc Abbey, otherwise the Abbey of Notre-Dame de Belloc (), is a Benedictine monastery located in Urt, in the Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques.

Childhood  He was born into a Telugu Smartha family bearing the name \\"Tangirala\\", of Apasthamba sutra, Krishna Yajur sakha, Kutsasa gotra, living in Alugumallepadu village in Palnadu area of Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, on the banks of river Naguleru. He was born on 11 April 1951 (Chaitra Shukla Shasti of the year Khara ( the sixth day of the bright fortnight in the month of Chaitra as per the Hindu calendar)) as a result of long prayer and vrata (fast) by his father Venkateswara Avadhani and mother Ananthalakshmamma. Seetharama Anjaneyalu (that was the Acharya's name in his poorvashrama) evinced signs of devotion towards the Almighty in His childhood. His Brahmopadesha was performed when he was seven years of age and he was regular in the performance of the prescribed karmas of Sandhyavandanam three times a day, and Agnikaryam, twice a day. Sri Anjaneyalu, in addition to schooling, spent time to study Sanskrit and also started taking Vedic lessons from his father, who himself was a Vedic scholar.  Influence of the guru  In the year 1966, Sri Anjaneyalu approached the 35th Jagadguru of the Sringeri Sharada Peetham, Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji as a bachelor, at the age of 15, seeking his blessings and tutelage in the sastras. The Jagadguru Acharya accepted the disciple and the lessons in the Tarka sastras commenced. The Acharya also kept a close watch over the progress of his ward.  Embracing Sanyasa  Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji announced his desire to appoint the brahmachari (\\"bachelor\\" in Sanskrit) Seetharama Anjaneyalu as the successor-designate (i.e., as the 36th Jagadguru acharya) and give him Sanyasa. The Shishya Sweekaram ceremony took place on the 11th day of November, 1974 and the brahmachari received the saffron robes, the sacred staff and the kamandalu (water pot) from the acharya. The newly initiated sanyasi was given the Yogapatta Sri Bharati Teertha in line with the Dashanami Sampradaya of Shri Adishankaracharya.  Reign as Jagadguru  Sri Bharati Teertha Mahaswami has studied shastras like Vedanta, Mimamsa, Tarka, Nyaya, Vyakarana amongst others. He has also completed his studies in the Yajur Veda in Sadvidya Sanjivini Pathasala prior to taking up Sanyasa. The devotees of the Sringeri Sharada Peetham pay frequent visits to the matha seeking guidance and blessings. Many notable personalities who are politicians, spiritual gurus, et al. like Narendra Modi, Abdul Kalam, etc. have also paid visits and sought guidance. The Acharya is familiar with and delivers benedictory addresses in Indian languages like Sanskrit, Kannada, Telugu, Tamil and Hindi which are available on Youtube. As part of the tradition, the acharya also undertakes Vijaya Yatras (tours) to visit different places and guide the devotees. The most recent one took place in the year 2017 which covered the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka. The various events involved in the Vijaya Yatra are covered by Sri Sankara TV, which broadcasts the highlights on a daily basis during the course of the Vijaya Yatra. During his reign as the Jagadguru, assisted by V. R. Gowrishankar - the current CEO and administrator of the Sringeri Sharada Peetham, the matha also undertook activities in the field of education and social service in addition to being a seat of Vedic learning. The Acharya is the pontiff, both in spiritual and secular sense. A celibate ascetic by tradition of the Matha, he leads the learning institutions within the monastery and worship festivals. In case of differing views on the operation of monastery, his decision is considered by the monks as binding. He is also responsible for screening, studying and selecting the monk who will succeed him as the next pontiff.  Appointment of the successor  Sri Bharati Teertha Mahaswami appointed the brahmachari Kuppa Venkateswara Prasada Sharma as his successor designate, i.e., the 37th Jagadguru of the Sringeri Sharada Peetham on 23 January 2015 and gave him the Yogapatta (monastic name) Sri Vidhusekhara Bharati Mahaswami.

The company specialized in the design and manufacture of fiberglass sailboats. The company was founded by Bob Clark in 1960 and continued in business until 1984. History Star keelboat The Don Martin-designed San Juan 21, a design that was well-received at the 1970 Seattle Boat Show. The first design produced was the Lightning, a racing dinghy. The company was one of the first to produce this boat design in fiberglass. The company went on to produce the OK, 505 and Thistle dinghies, as well as the Star keelboat. Star production began with the building of the mold plug by Olympic Star class sailing gold medalist, William Earl Buchan. Later, the molds went sent back to Buchan at the end of production. The company employed many members of Bob Clark's family. Son Dennis started his own sail manufacturing business in 1971, the Clark Sails Loft. Dennis Clark was also a one design champion in several boat classes. Son Dave Martin became the head of sales and marketing for the company. Son Don Martin earned a degree in engineering and completed addition studies in naval architecture. He designed the San Juan 21, which was introduced at the 1970 Seattle Boat Show to positive acclaim. This design had a production run of 2600 boats and was the first of the San Juan series of boats, named for the nearby chain of islands. The San Juan boat line was quite commercial successful. With business growing, the company established an east coast plant at New Bern, North Carolina in 1972. The company hired Bruce Kirby, of Laser fame, to design the San Juan 24 and it entered production the following year, in 1973, with more than 1,000 examples produced during its production run. Kirby also designed the San Juan 30 for the International Offshore Rule 1/2 Ton class. The 1977 San Juan 26 was a trailer sailer equipped with a centerboard, aimed at the same market as the MacGregor 26, but it did not sell well and was replaced in the product line by the more race- oriented San Juan 7.7 in 1979. The company introduced the San Juan 23 in 1977, with a choice of a fixed or swing keel and two sizes of masts. The same year saw the introduction of the San Juan 28 and the derivative 29, which were among the company's most commercially successful designs. The company was sold to San Juan Manufacturing in 1984 and it soon went bankrupt. The molds were sold off with some designs being bought by Tanzer Industries in Montreal, who built some boats from the line, until its bankruptcy in 1986.

She married into the Zia tribe in 1978 and, as is traditional, gained tribal permission to use Zia designs in her work. Her first pots were in the Jemez style. In some instances she has collaborated with her mother-in-law, Sofia Medina, whom she cites as her inspiration. Medina has been recognized widely for her work. She's been featured in numerous publications (including New Mexico Magazine, August 1994:36, and SWAIA Quarterly Fall 1982:10), galleries (Native American Collections in Denver, CO; Adobe Gallery and Agape Gallery in Albuquerque, NM), and museums (Wright Collection, Peabody Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA; Spurlock Museum, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), and has also received many awards from 1984‚Äìpresent.  Pottery Style & Technique  Medina is particularly known for her polychrome ollas and jars, featuring cream-colored and tan slips that her mother-in-law also uses, as well as rose-red and orange slips. Her favorite designs include roadrunners, robins, berry bushes, flowers, rain clouds, rainbows, fineline hatching, and some turtle effigy lids. Occasionally she produces plain pots for her husband Marcellus to paint with designs of Zia dancers. She uses a combination of sheep and cow manure to fire her pots. To achieve a white background color instead of blue, the manure must be completely dry. One way to protect the pots from fire smudges is through the reuse of everyday objects such as old bedsprings and auto shock absorbers. Zia pots are unique in that they are tempered with basalt, a hard volcanic rock. Medina has been known to bury the rock in sand for a full year in order to soften it for grinding.

Speculation has surrounded its origination and date of creation. The enameled ewer is one of the many treasures found at the Saint-Maurice d'Agaune monastery. The origins of the piece were said to have been seventh century, but until more recently, in 2008, it is argued to have been from the fifth or early sixth century due to the application of the cloisonn√©.  Description  The Ewer is 30.3 cm high with a long neck and two rounded discs forming the body. The motifs centralized on the body of the ewer are, on one disk, two eagle-headed griffins, and on the other disk, two lions encompassing a lotus tree. The tall neck also has two enamel rectangular pieces with detailed design work. The intricate cloisonn√© work utilizes irregular shaped sapphires, and other deep enamel of emerald green, pearl white, and dark blue. The colored gemstones were understood primarily as symbolic representations of the cycle of the seasons in the Byzantine period - green for spring, blue for winter, red for summer, and white for autumn, which is also attributed to a similar vase found at Saint-Maurice d'Agaune.  Origin  The date and origination of the ewer has been highly debated among art historians and students. This debate includes belief that it originated from Islamic, Carolingian, or Sasanian origins. Although some of the imagery of the ewer could allude to a multitude of origins, the griffin disk enamel work tie this piece to the Byzantine period. Previous to 2008, it was presumed to have been a piece from the seventh century, but in the late fifth century stylistic changes moved from plain foil beneath the gemstone inlay to a decorative style that remained popular from the late fifth century and after. Instead of utilizing the popular decorative foil used predominately after the late fifth century, it has the plain foil style relevant to earlier fifth century work.

It is native to the tropical western Indian Ocean where it is confined to the coasts of Madagascar, growing in shallow water. Description Stylophora madagascarensis is a colonial species of coral forming clumps of slender, compact branches with blunt ends. The branches are up to in diameter. The corallites (stony cups in which the polyps sit) are crowded and circular, with those near the tips of the branches often being hooded. The corallites have six septa (stony plates forming the wall of the corallite) fused to a central, style-like columella. The coenosteum (the coral's stony skeleton) is covered with tiny spines. This is a zooxanthellate species of coral, the tissues of which harbour single-celled dinoflagellates living in symbiosis with the coral and providing it with nourishment. The polyps expand to feed at night and are retracted during the daytime. This coral is pale brown in colour, sometimes with pinkish bases to the branches. Distribution This coral is endemic to the coasts of Madagascar. It grows in shallow water, both on moderately exposed reefs and in more sheltered lagoons, where it tends to have longer branches. Status This species is common around the coasts of Madagascar but the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as \\"endangered\\". This is because the reefs around Madagascar are being degraded at such a rate that it is estimated that 58% of the habitat will be lost within 30 years (estimated to be three generations for corals). The chief threats faced by corals are associated with climate change, ocean acidification, increasing severity of storms and rising seawater temperatures, resulting in coral bleaching and an increased susceptibility of corals to disease. Its small total population size makes this coral more vulnerable to these threats than a more widespread species.

On 30 September 1943 Keiper published his statement in which he emphasized that Germany had no territorial pretensions over Montenegro and that German forces are in Montenegro only because of the military circumstances in order to secure Montenegrin Adriatic coast from Allied invasion. Keiper invited population of Montenegro to be loyal. Keiper emphasized that it is not important if Montenegro is White or Green, it is important that Montenegro would not be Red. = Gendarmerie and militia = On 20 October 1943 Keiper invited all male population of Montenegro aged between 18 and 40 to join gendarmerie. He recruited 1,500 men in militia and 7,500 in gendarmerie which would support German forces to struggle against Communists. Keiper organized six battalions of gendarmerie in six Montenegrin counties controlled by Germans: Boka Kotorska, Bar, Cetinje, Podgorica, Danilovgrad and Nik≈°iƒá. Keiper established two more battalions consisting of 3,000 former Chetniks from two counties occupied by the Communist forces: Kola≈°in and ≈†avnik. The commander of Gendarmerie was former artillery lieutenant Pero Maru≈°iƒá. On 1 November Keiper issued an announcement that people who would follow instructions of Communists or Dragoslav Mihailoviƒá would be severely punished. Keiper treated Mihailoviƒá's Chetniks as enemies, but that did not prevent him from making secret arrangements in order to collaborate with them against the Communist-led Partisans. : \\" Kajper je veƒá 1. novembra u svom proglasu nagovijestio da ƒáe biti najstro≈æe ka≈ænjen svako ko se bude ogrije≈°io o njemaƒçka nareƒëenja, ¬ªi bude slu≈°ao komuniste ili Mihailoviƒáa. ¬´138a Interesantno je ovdje primijetiti kako Kajper tretira ƒçetnike D.

Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá began his cooperation with Keiper since June 1944. On 12 November 1943 Keiper published a threat that the German occupying forces would kill 20 hostages for each German soldier killed in Montenegro and 10 for each wounded German soldier. After numerous people and priests evacuated from Cetinje, Keiper also did not stay in Cetinje.

History The drama school was founded in 1939 as the Westf√§lische Schauspielschule Bochum by Saladin Schmitt, then intendant of the Schauspielhaus Bochum. It was originally a municipal school. Up to the 1970s, the intendant was also the artistic director of the drama school. In 2000, it became a state school of North Rhine-Westphalia and a Bochum location of the Folkwang-Hochschule. In 2014, the main location of the drama school changed to the new Folkwang- Theaterzentrum (Folkwang theatre centre) in Wiemelhausen, close to the centre of Bochum.

Studies Performance at the park of Haus Weitmar in 2001 The curriculum is planned for eight semesters, four of them for fundamental training of voice, speech, and body movement. Students take part in a production of Schauspielhaus Bochum during their third year in order to achieve insight into theatre practise. During the last semester, students are offered practical work at various German-speaking theatres. They also receive courses in acting in front of a camera, in collaboration with the broadcaster Westdeutscher Rundfunk K√∂ln. The second-year students give a performance in the summer at Haus Weitmar. Traditionally, a play or scenes by Shakespeare are presented.

It has been described as a \\"non-proliferation treaty\\" for fossil fuels. The project was undertaken with financial support from the Government of Canada, through their environmental department known as Environment and Climate Change Canada. History The Alliance was launched by Canada and the UK at the COP23 climate summit in November 2017. Announcing the launch, Climate Action Network-Canada Executive Director Catherine Abreu said: By the end of the summit, membership had grown to include over 20 countries, regions and organizations. Within a month membership had grown to over 50 . Its purpose is to establish a new international norm, or ‚Äústandard of appropriate behaviour‚Äù, that coal should not be burned for power. In April 2018 a research partnership was announced with Bloomberg Philanthropies. In October 2018 the South Korean province of South Chungcheong became the first jurisdiction in Asia and the largest user of coal power to join the Alliance. In December 2018 Sydney, Melbourne, Scotland, Scottish Power, Senegal and Israel also joined and in September 2019 seven new members joined including Germany and Slovakia. Aims Alliance members agree that: * Governments/states will phase out existing traditional coal power. * Governments/states will create a moratorium on any new traditional coal power stations without operational carbon capture and storage. * Businesses/organisations will power operations without coal. * Members will ensure policies and investments support clean power. * Members will restrict financing for traditional coal power without carbon capture and storage. Reaction Reacting to the launch, Tracy Carty of Oxfam said the Alliance: Business change organisation The B Team welcomed the Alliance, and argued that exiting coal must happen as a just transition that protects vulnerable workers and communities such as coal mining communities.

It has been owned by members of the von Plassen family since 1728 and is now part of the Londholm-Sels√∏ estate.. Lindholm's home farm (avlsg√•rd) is operated under the name Farm of Ideas in collaboration with the chef Christian Puglisi. It is used as a venue for various gastronomy and sustainability related events and delivers fresh produce for his restaurants in Copenhagen. History =Origins= Lindholm is first mentioned in 1330 when it was pledged by Johannes Hviding to St. Clare's Priory in Roskilde. In the 15th century, Lindholm consisted of two farms which belonged to Our Lady's Abbey. The abbey was dissolved after the Reformation in 1536 and all its land was confiscated by the Crown. In circa 1570, the Crown seems to have merged the two farms in Lindholm and ten tenant farms into a fief. It was later incorporated in the larger fief of Roskildegaard, =Changing owners, 1616‚Äì1728= In 1616, Lindholm was acquired by Breide Rantzau in exchange for other land. He placed it under the much larger Svanholm estate. After Breide Rantzau's death in 1618, Lindholm was endowed to his sdaughter Sophie Rantzau and son-in-law Hans Lindenov Lindholm. In 1633, Lindholm was acquired by Christen Friis in exchange for other land. He expanded Lindholm into a manor of considerable size, both by increasing the land under the manor and by placing more tenant farms under it. In connection with the introduction of absolute monarchy in 1660, it became possible for people outside the nobility to own manors. Hans Zo√´ga, a professor at the University of Copenhagen, acquired Lindholm in 1664 but sold it to his colleague Rasmus Bartholin later that same year. Ole R√∏mer, his son-in-law, was for a while a co-owner of the estate. Gothard Bream, who acquired the estate Lindholm in 1690, expanded the estate with more land. His widow, Anne Cathrine Wedelmann, married Severin Wildsch. Anne Cathrine Wedelmann's heirs sold the estate after her death. =Plessen family= Christian Ludvig von Plessen The new owner was Christian Ludvig Scheel von Plessen. He created a fine new garden at the site. By testament, Plessen created a Fideikommis from the estate with the effect that it could neither be sold or divided between heirs. AfterChristian Ludvig Scheel von Plessen's death in 1752, Sels√∏ and Lindholm were handed down to his grandson Christian Ludvig Scheel-Plessen. His son Mogens Scheel-Plessen was the next owner. The Plessen family were also major landowners in Holstein. After the loss of Schleswig-Holstein, the owners gradually became more attached to their German holdings. Carl Gabriel Joachim Vilhelm Scheel-Plessen ainhereted Londholm in 1892. He refurbished the main building and also constructed a new home farm after a fire in 1907. The stamhus was dissolved as a result of the Lensafl√∏sningsloven of 1919. Only 8 hectares of land was sold in the process. Architecture The main building is designed in Italian style. The central part of the building is seven bays wide and has a half hipped, red Mansard roof. It is flanked by two, lower, five-bay side wings. The building is rendered in a pale, yellow colour but the taller central portion has a white, three-bay, rusticated section and white corner lesenes. Rach of the side wings feature a high Dutch gable-fronted dormer. The site also comprises two smaller houses: a brick house for the manager and a halftimbered for the gardener. Today Londholm covers 309 hectares of which 289 hectares is farmland, 10 hectares is pastures and 10 hectares is bogland.

() is a Ukrainian television game show broadcast on Novyi Kanal. It is an adaptation of the Dutch game show Beat the Blondes. The show aired two seasons in 2010 and 2011, before being revived in 2018.  Rules of the game  In the game, one main player, usually a man, is involved. As its rivals stand 50 blondes ‚Äî 49 mediocre and 1 TOP blonde. Each of the blondes responded to the questions prepared by the program before the game. Then the girls are divided into 8 rows, 7 participants in 7 rows and 1 blond girl who heads the girls.

For the victory over the top blonde earned in the course of the game budget doubles. = Round 1 = The main player to choose from is ten themes. Before each question forward one number of blondes goes. The player chooses a theme and he is given one of the questions that was before the game is given to the blondes. There are four answers to each question. If the player answered correctly, the wrong answer answered, the blonde left the game, and answered correctly pass to the second round and the player for each knocked blonde on the score is credited to 100 hryvnia on the first question (and blondes of the first row), 200 hryvnia on the second and so on. On the seventh question, every one who threw out the blonde brings the player 700 hryvnia. On the eighth question, if the player answered correctly, and the main blonde is not, then the player's personal account doubles.

Navasie carries on the white ware pottery tradition from her mother, which she contends was developed around 1951 or 1952. She is particularly known for her black and red on white designs, and her favorite motifs include rain, clouds, parrots, and feathers. Her pots are signed with a frog‚Äîa hallmark she began around 1939. Her signature differs from her mother's in that it features web feet rather than short toes. All Navasie's pottery is made the traditional way, from the gathering of the clay to the polishing and painting. Pots are fired in sheep dung, which she says is getting more difficult to acquire, but she prefers this over commercial products. Navasie's pots can be found in a number of museums (Museum of Northern Arizona, Heard Museum, and Spurlock Museum) and have fetched high prices at auction, some over $1,000.

After the time of Alexander the Great, Eupalium fell into the hands of the Aetolians; and Philip V of Macedon, when he made a descent upon the Aetolian coast in 207 BCE, landed at Erythrae, which is described by Livy as near Eupalium. This Erythrae was probably the port of Eupalium. Eupalium's site is located near Kastro Soule.

He pursued a career in medical examination and served, from 1930 to 1958, as the coroner with jurisdiction over much of London. He is best known for his role in the development of Operation Mincemeat, a deception operation during the Second World War. Biography Bentley Purchase's father, Sir William Henry Purchase of Luton, was a successful importer of straw goods such as hats. The family had means to enroll young Bentley in Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he pursued the liberal arts. Graduating from Cambridge in 1911, Purchase studied law and entered medical studies at the London Hospital, graduating in 1914. Bentley was commissioned as a medical officer in the Royal Artillery on the Western Front in 1914-18, and was awarded the Military Cross in 1917. Upon the coming of peacetime Purchase continued his career pathway and resumed his interrupted legal and medical studies, becoming a barrister in the Inner Temple in 1919 and a Bachelor in Medicine in 1921. He was now qualified to serve as a coroner with jurisdiction over cases that required the presence of a medical examiner. He worked two part-time jobs in the 1920s, as a lawyer and as a deputy coroner within East London. During this period he married Beryl Chapman, with whom he would have two children. In 1930, upon the retirement of the coroner Sir Walter Schr√∂der, Bentley Purchase won appointment as a full-fledged coroner. His jurisdiction shifted over different neighborhoods within London, but always included the broad area of dense population from the City of Westminster on the southwest to Islington toward the northeast. Purchase served as an official coroner within London from 1930 until 1958, winding down in that year by moving his office from London to Ipswich. Purchase served in office as the Ipswich coroner until his death in 1961, which occurred by mishap. Attempting to repair his television antenna, the lawyer-physician tumbled from the roof of his private home. He was age 70. Significant cases As coroner, Purchase held approximately 20,000 inquests into deaths that, in his medico-legal judgement, deserved formal inquiry. In cases where the cause of death was unknown or where inquiries were required to assist the police, Purchase worked closely with specialists in forensic pathology such as Bernard Spilsbury and Keith Simpson. Murder cases inquired into by Purchase included homicides committed by John Christie and John Haigh. Also as coroner, Purchase provided a corpse in 1943 for use in Operation Mincemeat. The World War II special operation centered on the release in Spanish territorial waters of a body dressed in the uniform of a British marine officer-courier. The body was supposed to be carrying top-secret planning documents in preparation for Anglo-American operations in the Mediterranean Sea. As a counter-intelligence initiative, the operation pointed German military intelligence, the Abwehr, toward locations far away from the Allies' true target of Sicily. The German armed forces did not take steps to establish tactical air command over Sicily at the time of the Allies' amphibious assault, and Operation Mincemeat is said to have saved thousands of lives. Legacy and honours During his active life in London, Bentley Purchase was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1949. Upon the winding-down of his responsibilities in 1958, he accepted a knighthood. After his death in 1961, a friendly biography (Robert Jackson, Coroner: the Biography of Sir Bentley Purchase, London: George G. Harrap and Co.), was published in 1963.

During the 1850s, William Paul resided in Philadelphia's Spring Garden neighborhood (5th Ward) with his parents and sisters: Frances, Virginia, Mary, Emma, and Ida, who were born, respectively, circa 1834, 1836, 1838, 1847, and 1854.

At the end of March, following basic training, he was transported with his regiment by rail to Baltimore, Maryland, quartered at the Patterson Park Barracks, and equipped with an altered smooth-bore musket before being moved again, by way of Washington, D.C., to Aquia Creek Landing, and assigned with his regiment to the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division of the U.S. Army's 1st Corps under the command of General Irvin McDowell. Marched to various sites in support of Union Army operations for the next several months, Paul and his fellow 90th Pennsylvanians saw their first major action in the Battle of Cedar Mountain, Virginia (August 9, 1862) during the opening of the Northern Virginia Campaign. Ordered to destroy a railroad bridge at Mitchell's Station on August 15, they next guarded the Union Army's rear as it retreated across the Rappahannock River, and then rendered support to Union artillery batteries during the First Battle of Rappahannock Station (August 22‚ÄìAugust 25) before moving on to operations associated with the Battle of Thoroughfare Gap (August 28). After fighting in the Second Battle of Bull Run (August 28‚Äì30) and Battle of Chantilly (September 1), they were reassigned to the Maryland Campaign under Major-General Joseph Hooker, and then fought again in the Battle of South Mountain (September 14).Bates, History of Pennsylvania Volunteers, 1861-5, Vol. III: ‚ÄúNinetieth Regiment‚Äù, pp. 151-153. Three days later, while fighting with his regiment in the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, William Paul performed the act of valor which later resulted in his being awarded the U.S. Medal of Honor.

After his regiment was reassigned to the Union Army's 1st Corps in 1862, he and his regiment then fought in the Battle of Fredericksburg (December 11-15, 1862). Ordered to fatigue duty in the New Year, they then participated in the Mud March led by Major-General Ambrose Burnside (January 1863) and the intense fighting of the Chancellorsville Campaign (April 30‚ÄìMay 6) before heading for Pennsylvania. Assigned to the Gettysburg Campaign, they then fought in the Battle of Gettysburg (July 1‚Äì3), and pursued the Confederate Army as it retreated into Maryland and Virginia. Reassigned to picket duties along the Rappahannock River that fall, the regiment skirmished periodically with Confederate troops while also participating in the destruction of enemy-controlled segments of the Manassas and Alexandria Railroad and repair of Union-controlled lines before being ordered to participate in the Mine Run Campaign in December.Bates, History of Pennsylvania Volunteers, 1861-5, Vol. III: ‚ÄúNinetieth Regiment‚Äù, pp. 153-155.

Encamped on the Sperryville Pike beginning February 6, they drilled throughout April and were also assigned to picket details. Marching with his regiment for Virginia's Wilderness on May 4, Paul was wounded in action again the next day while fighting with the 90th Pennsylvania in the Battle of the Wilderness.

Mochizuki received a special award from the National Science Foundation for his work on the Burnside problem.  Biography  Mochizuki was born in California on 18 May 1937 from parents of Japanese ancestry. Following the Imperial Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt authorized on 19 February 1942 the deportation and internment of Japanese Americans with Executive Order 9066 which allowed regional military commanders to designate \\"military areas\\" from which \\"any or all persons may be excluded\\". This authority was used to declare that all people of Japanese ancestry were excluded from the West Coast, including all of California and parts of Oregon, Washington, and Arizona, except for those in government camps. Mochizuki was interned with his family in the Jerome War Relocation Center in Arkansas. After World War II, the family moved back to Madera, California, where Horace won the Madera County spelling bee in 1951. Mochizuki received his doctoral degree from the University of Washington with a dissertation work entitled \\"Finitistic homological dimensions and duality theory for rings\\". He began teaching at University of California, Santa Barbara in 1965. Mochizuki died on 9 June 1989 from a cancer of pancreas. His wife, Keiko, committed suicide two days later by drowning in the Pacific Ocean.  Work  At the beginning of his academic career, Mochizuki's worked on ring theory. He started to cooperate with Seymour Bachmuth on group theory. For his work on Burnside groups, Mochizuki received a special award from the National Science Foundation for \\"projects of high scientific merit involving scientists with a record of outstanding research accomplishments...\\" Mochizuki is known for a non-commutative version of \\"Kolchin's Theorem\\" that solved a theorem of Ivan Kaplansky and for his work on automorphism groups with Bachmuth.

Giles completed her doctor of philosophy at the University of Oxford in 2015, where she was a member of St Hugh's College. She worked with Matt Friedman on early ray-finned fishes.  Career and research In 2015, Giles was appointed a junior research fellow at Christ Church, Oxford. Giles was awarded a L'Or√©al-UNESCO fellowship in 2016, which would allow her to study the anatomy of vertebrate's brains. In 2017, Giles was awarded a Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowship to study the evolution of the actinopterygii. In 2018, she joined the School of Geography, Earth & Environmental Sciences at the University of Birmingham as a member of academic staff. Giles uses x-ray tomography to study the bone structure of Actinopterygii. Whilst the long-held assumption was that sharks were primitive forms of fish, Giles found that our latest common ancestors are not like sharks, but common bony and cartilaginous. Giles identified a new genus of Actinopterygii, which provided a new model of cranial anatomy. She used synchrotron-CT scans to examine the endoskeletal anatomy of Cheirolepis. The ray-finned fishes comprise half of extinct vertebrate species. She compares the brains of ancient and modern fish, which helps to understand the evolution of the brain. Giles identified that ray-finned fish originated during the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary. By comparing scanilepiform fossils and Bichir, Giles found that ray-finned fishes were 40 million years younger than previously expected, \\"shaking up\\" and \\"rewriting\\" the evolutionary tree. She also studied Meemannia, finding lateral carnial and spiracular canals. She also works on Placodermi and Gnathostomata. She has written for the HuffPost and given several popular science lectures. In 2019 Giles was awarded the Geological Society of London Lyell Fund, which is awarded to researchers on the basis of outstanding published research.

Life Barbara Fitzgerald was born Barbara Gregg in Cork on 16 December 1911. Her parents were John Allen Fitzgerald Gregg and Anna Gregg (n√©e Jennings). Fitzgerald spent her youth in Kilkenny and Dublin, attending school in England. She entered Trinity College Dublin as a foundation scholar in 1931. In 1933 she graduated with honours in Italian and French. She married Michael Fitzgerald Somerville on 21 August 1935 at St Bartholomew's Church, Dublin. As a society wedding, people lined the streets of Ballsbridge to watch the wedding party pass. Fitzgerald's father performed the wedding ceremony, with the couple then honeymooning in Scotland. Her husband was an oil executive, and the couple lived in west Africa until the beginning of World War II when they returned to England. Her father-in-law was Henry Boyle Townshend Somerville, who was murdered on 14 March 1936 by the IRA. Her first novel, We are besieged, was published in 1946 and describes the destruction of an Irish big house in 1920, Butler's Hill. Some of the scenes and settings are similar to those used by Elizabeth Bowen. Her second novel, Footprints upon water, was first published in 1955 and was reissued after her death in 1983. We are besieged was republished again in 2011, and Footprints upon water in 2012 leading to a rediscovery of her work. Fitzgerald retired to Ireland in 1968 with her husband. She suffered with ill health for a number of years, succumbing to early dementia. She died in Dublin on 21 May 1982. She had a son, Julian and a daughter, Christina.

The police were notified of the body‚Äôs location by an anonymous caller who claimed that he could not give his name for reasons of ‚Äúnational security‚Äù. Neither the identity of the woman nor that of the caller has ever been established despite an extensive investigation.  Discovery of the victim  On Friday 28 August 1981, at around 8:00 am, Constable John Jeffries of Ripon Police received a telephone call at the police station from a man who was described as well spoken and with a slight trace of a local accent. The caller said: ‚ÄúNear Scawton Moor House, you will find a decomposed body among the willow herbs.‚Äù The caller then gave instructions on how to find the body. The call lasted for less than a minute. When the caller was asked for his name and address, he stated that he could not give this information for ‚Äúreasons of national security‚Äù and abruptly terminated the call. The local village constable attended the location identified but could not initially find the body. However, after careful searching, he uncovered human bones underneath a large bed of Rosebay Willow. The CID was called to the scene and cleared a large area of undergrowth. The body was discovered near to Sutton Bank Top on an unclassified road between Sutton Bank and Scawton and Rievaulx near the junction with the A170 Thirsk to Scarborough road. It is thought that the body had lain undisturbed for up to two years. A clue was a discarded lid from a tin of meat paste, found to have been sold on 6 October 1979, which was found beneath the body. Police believe the woman was murdered but have never revealed how she died. Although the location was near to the entrance to Scawton Moor House Farm, a popular family picnic area, the body was so well concealed that it was highly improbable that it could have been discovered by accident. The anonymous caller became a suspect in the murder, but his identity was never established.  Description of the victim  In life, the woman was tall. She had dark brown hair with a length of around 4-6 inches which was untreated and cut in a page-boy style. The victim‚Äôs toenails were painted with Max Factor Maxi, pale-pink and she wore a size four shoe. The woman had given birth to two or three children during her life and although no wedding ring was found it is believed that she had been married. No jewellery or clothing of any kind was found with the body implying that someone had tried to conceal the victims identity. Analysis of the skeleton revealed that the victim had a neck vertebrae abnormality which would have caused a bad back. The victim also had a displaced septum and an old ankle fracture. Bone analysis revealed that until the age of seven, the woman lived in an area with high levels of natural fluoride in the drinking water. Two local areas that had such water were Hartlepool and Grimsby. All the victim's upper teeth, and all but six of her lower teeth, were missing and an upper dental plate had been fitted. The woman had heavy staining on her remaining teeth which indicated that she smoked and drank heavily and generally, did not look after herself.  Subsequent events  Following the investigation of the site of the discovery the wider investigation discovered some female clothing, a black evening gown and some underwear, hanging from a tree about a mile away from the location of the body. The items could not be proved to relate to the discovery of the woman but no one has come forward to claim them. Police investigated the possibility that the woman was an escaped inmate from Askham Grange open prison. However, the prisoner unexpectedly responded to a request to prove that she was still alive by sending investigating officers two thumb prints and a signature on a blank sheet of paper. In November 1981 medical students constructed a waxwork of the woman in one of the first examples of using this technique to try to identify an unknown decedent. In 2012, the body was exhumed so that a DNA profile could be created. The profile was compared to samples from five families, two of whom came forward of their own volition, that could potentially be related to the woman. No match was found. In 2013 police stated that they had added the woman‚Äôs DNA profile to the national database in the hope that a match would be found in the future.

After World War II, baseball was popularized by American soldiers who were stationed in Germany. Today, baseball is a minor sport in Germany, although the country is still home to one of Europe's biggest baseball communities, with around 30,000 active players. The national governing body is the Deutscher Baseball und Softball Verband (German Baseball and Softball Federation), and the highest baseball league is the 1. Baseball Bundesliga. Max Kepler is currently the only German- developed player in Major League Baseball. History =Before World War II= The first mention of baseball in Germany was found in a 1796 book on sports by German writer Johann Christoph Friedrich GutsMuths, where he was writing about a game called schlagbal, a very old German-Austrian game. Although Germans were exposed to bat-and-ball games from an early stage, baseball did not rise in popularity until after World War II. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, a lot of European countries received interest from major league players, one of which was Hall of Fame member John McGraw. From 1888 to 1889, A.G. Spalding went on a Major League Baseball world tour where he visited Italy, France and the United Kingdom, but not Germany since Berlin was covered in snow that winter. In 1912-1913, John McGraw and Charlie Comiskey went on another world tour, but again Germany, because of the threat of inclement weather during the tour, was left off the schedule. This likely was a reason why baseball was left more undeveloped than in other European countries like Italy or the Netherlands. During World War I, American soldiers played baseball in Germany but the first official game on German grounds took place in Berlin at the 1936 Olympics. The sport was introduced in a demonstration tournament where the United States was planned to play against other nations, including Japan. The ongoing economic depression caused other nations to cancel their arrangements for the tournament, leaving the Americans to play a split-squad exhibition game in front of the German audience on the last day of the Olympics. On August 12, 1936, the World Amateurs and the U.S. Olympics played at the Olympiastadion in front of possibly up to 125,000 spectators, which would be largest baseball audience to date. The stadium was not designed to accommodate baseball, leaving lights only into the air and Adolf Hitler's box in the right field fair territory. The World Amateurs won the game 6‚Äì5 in 7 innings on a walkoff-inside-the-park-homerun by Les McNeece. After the game, the players were congratulated and praised by Dr. Carl Diem, the secretary of the German Organization Committee. \\"I have come officially to advise you that this has been the finest demonstration of any sport that any nation has ever put on at any Olympic Games,\\" Diem said. After this event there were multiple teams that appeared around Berlin and even in southern Germany. When the war started though, the \\"American pastime\\" was no longer welcomed, and there was no more baseball played by Germans until after the war. =During World War II= During World War II, baseball was played in many POW camps by American GIs, although it was mostly softball. There was difficulty obtaining equipment, and games were often played with modified rules. Baseball was seen as a morale-booster for POWs, and was played in almost every camp housing Americans; hundreds of teams played in organized leagues. As the war came to an end, baseball began to be played outside of POW camps. Several professional Major League and Negro League players took part in those military competitions, including Hall of Famers Warren Spahn and Leon Day, as well as six-time All-Star Ewell Blackwell. The games were mainly played for military personnel, and as a result had little impact on the native Germans. =1945‚Äì1980= After World War II, Germany was divided into four occupation zones, one of which was controlled by the United States. One of their goals was to expose the German youth to the \\"American way of life\\". In order to do that they created the GYA (German Youth Activities), where they used baseball, basketball and American football (as well as already-popular sports like boxing, athletics and gymnastics) to teach them American values. In the years following the war, baseball flourished in certain parts of Germany, mainly in Berlin and in the south around cities like Mannheim, Ramstein, Stuttgart, Nuremberg and Munich. In the non-U.S. zones of Germany, baseball remained unknown. By 1948, there were 140 teams around Germany, and in 1949 the Frankfurt Juniors, the first German baseball club was founded. The Allgemeine Baseball-Foederation Deutschland (ABFD) was formed in 1950, and the first German championship tournament was held the following year. By 1954, there were several other European countries playing baseball, and Germany became one of the five founding members of the Confederation Europenne de Baseball Amateur. Germany played at the inaugural European Baseball Championship in 1954 where they placed fourth and last. In the mid-1950s, many American troops returned to the United States, which had a negative impact on the popularity of baseball in Germany. The next generation were not exposed to the game, and many American coaches returned home. In the 1970s, Germany traveled to Managua, Nicaragua, twice to compete in the Baseball World Cup, but they failed to win a single game, placing last in both tournaments. In 1970, the ABFD was disbanded, and between 1969 and 1981 there was no national champion crowned. By 1979, there was only one club left, the Mannheim Tornados. =1980 to now= In 1980, a process to rebuild baseball in Germany began. That year, the German baseball community officially registered the Deutscher Baseball und Softball Verband (DBV) as the governing body with German authorities. The 1. Baseball Bundesliga was reformed in 1982 and is still active. The number of active players has grown from less than 2,000 in 1989 to almost 30,000 players today. The 1. Baseball Bundesliga is one of the most competitive leagues in Europe, just below the Honkbal Hoofdklasse in the Netherlands and the Italian Baseball League. However, the Germans have not had a first or second place finish at the European Championship since the inaugural tournament in 1954. There have still been several German players that were able to sign with MLB clubs in the past 18 years, with Max Kepler and Donald Lutz being the two players to have played professionally at the highest level in the United States. It has been suggested that Kepler's success in particular could have an enormous impact on the popularity of baseball in Germany, as a role model for children. Since 2017, MLB games have been broadcast on German television, with the channels SPORT1, SPORT1 US and DAZN showing more than 75 games a season. Baseball Bundesliga The Baseball Bundesliga, established in 1984, is the highest German baseball league. It is divided into two levels, 1. Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga, each with two divisions (North and South) containing five to eight teams each. The regular season is played between March and July, followed by a playoff postseason. The Mannheim Tornados are the only team that has played in the league since its inception. They also, as of 2018, have the most national titles (10), followed by the Paderborn Untouchables (6) and the Buchbinder Legion√§re Regensburg (5). Germans in MLB =American-born players with German ancestry= German Americans comprise a significant percentage of players in baseball history. Between 1871 and 1875 they made up 30% of players, and between 1900 and 1920 roughly 28% of players were of German heritage. Famous German American players include: *Levi Meyerle, won the batting title in 1871 with the highest single- season batting average of all-time (.492). *George Zettlein, who was considered the hardest thrower of the 1870s. *Addie Joss, Hall of Fame pitcher with the second lowest career ERA (1.89), and no losing season, pitched a perfect game. *Ed Reulbach, who completed 201 of 300 starts, and had a 2.28 ERA. *Frank Schulte, who won the first National League MVP award in 1911. *Rube Waddell, Hall of Famer, 2.13 ERA. *Honus Wagner, one of the first 5 inductees to the Hall of Fame, .327 career batting average, 8 batting titles, 17 consecutive seasons with a batting average over .300. *Chuck Klein, Hall of Famer, Triple Crown in 1933. *Babe Ruth, arguably greatest player in baseball history. *Lou Gehrig, 2 MVPs, 1 Triple Crown, played in 2130 consecutive games, nicknamed the \\"iron horse\\". *Cal Ripken Jr., 2632 consecutive games, nicknamed the \\"iron man\\", 3183 hits, 19-time All-Star. =German-born players in MLB= In total, there have been 44 German-born players who have played in Major League Baseball. Of those, 25 played in the Majors before 1933, and 11 players played between 1933 and 1999. During the latter time period, only one German-born player appeared in a Major League All-Star Game, Glenn Hubbard, a former second baseman and first base coach of the Atlanta Braves. Since 2000, eight German-born players have appeared in MLB, one of whom is Edwin Jackson. Jackson was an All-Star in 2009, and he threw a no-hitter on June 25, 2010. In 2018, he also tied a Major League record when he made a pitching appearance for his 13th Major League team. =German-developed players in MLB= Brothers Klaus and J√ºrgen Helmig were the first German-developed players to sign a professional baseball contract. In 1956, after practicing daily and playing alongside military teams for several years, they received an offer from the Baltimore Orioles. The Orioles wanted to use this signing for press exposure, leading to the Helmig brothers receiving media attention upon their arrival in the United State. They were invited to the White House and visited the Annual Baseball Writers' Association dinner where they were special guests. Their baseball careers in the minor leagues did not last long, as they were released by the Orioles after a couple of months. Instead, they started playing for the Baltimore Elite Stars in the Negro leagues. They are credited with being two of the few white players to ever play in the Negro leagues. At the end of the 1956 summer, they returned to Germany, where they continued their baseball careers until 1978. They were elected into the in 2006. In 2000, Mitch Franke became the first player from the German baseball Bundesliga to sign a professional contract with an MLB organization, the Milwaukee Brewers. He never made it to the top, but he opened the doors for other Germans like pitcher Tim Henkenjohann, who played in the Minnesota Twins organization between 2002 and 2005, and catcher Simon G√ºhring, a player in the Milwaukee Brewers organization in 2002 and 2003. Since 2007, there have been multiple German-developed players that signed professional contracts. Most of them only played a few seasons with different minor league teams, before returning to Germany. They include: *Ludwig Glaser, Los Angeles Angels, third baseman, 2008. *Kai Gronauer, New York Mets, catcher, 2008-2014. *Markus Solbach, Minnesota Twins; Arizona Diamondbacks, pitcher, 2011-2017. *Daniel Thieben, Seattle Mariners, pitcher, 2012-2014. *Maik Ehmcke, Arizona Diamondbacks, outfielder, 2014-2015. *Julsan Kamara, Philadelphia Phillies, outfielder, 2014-2015. *Sven Schueller, Los Angeles Dodgers, pitcher, 2014‚Äìpresent. *Nadir Ljatifi, Cincinnati Reds, infielder, 2015‚Äìpresent. *Pascal Amon, Los Angeles Dodgers, outfielder and first baseman, 2016-2018. *Niklas Rimmel, Minnesota Twins, pitcher, 2018‚Äìpresent. In April 2013, outfielder Donald Lutz became the first German-developed player to play in Major League Baseball when he made his debut for the Cincinnati Reds. Max Kepler of the Minnesota Twins also trained in his native Germany before being signed by the Twins at age 16, making his major league debut six years later, in 2015. He has since been a consistent force in the Minnesota Twins lineup, hitting 56 homeruns between 2016 and 2018. German Baseball Hall of Fame The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is a key component of America's national pastime, which is why the German Baseball and Softball Federation launched the in 1994.

Education and early career Wendt was born in Hamburg. The son of a female singer and a doctor, he began playing the piano at the age of four. He decided soon after leaving school at the Lise-Meitner-Gymnasium in Osdorf, Hamburg to turn to jazz. He then played regularly in the Hamburg music pub Sperl, where he was discovered by Joe Cocker. Cocker took Wendt as the opening act of his tour of Germany, so he became known quickly throughout the country.Hamburger Morgenpost, Gro√üartiges Tasten-Feuerwerk, 6 May 2005Nordwest-Zeitung, 11 February 2005Bayerische Rundschau, 31 March 2005 Important stations were concerts with Chuck Berry, whose Germany tour he accompanied on the piano, or with the band Pur in the sold-out Arena Auf Schalke, and the soundtrack to 7 Zwerge ‚Äì M√§nner allein im Wald. After working in the Dutch town of Hilversum and studying in New York City, he returned to Hamburg, where he now lives with his wife and two children in Gro√ü Flottbek. In addition to his passion for jazz, blues and boogie-woogie, he also cares about early musical education of children.

She works on characterisation techniques for gallium nitride materials for light-emitting diodes and laser diodes.  Early life and education  Oliver studied engineering and materials science at the University of Oxford and completed an industrial placement in metallurgy. Her final year masters project was in optoelectronic materials. She completed her Doctor of Philosophy degree at the University of Oxford in 2003, where she began to work with gallium nitride under the supervision of Andrew Briggs. She used metalorganic vapour-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) to grow quantum dots. During her PhD, she spent several months working in an industrial lab in America.  Research and career She joined the University of Cambridge in 2003 as a Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 postdoctoral research fellow. In 2006 Oliver was awarded a Royal Society University Research Fellowship (URF) at the University of Cambridge. She studied the morphology of gallium nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs), identifying what factors controlled their efficiency and the impact of defects. She was awarded an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) grant to study semi-polar nitride based structures. She was appointed a lecturer at the University of Cambridge in 2011. Oliver studies gallium nitride materials for LEDs and laser diodes. Her research considers ways to engineer the nanostructure of light emitting diodes and how this impacts macroscopic device performance. She has developed atom-probe tomography and scanning capacitance microscopy to study nitride devices. Oliver is also working on single-photon indium gallium nitride quantum dots for quantum crystallography. She has looked at the impact of threading dislocations on the quality factor of InGaN cavities. Her group developed the first blue-emitting single-photon source. She was the first to note rabi oscillations of GaN quantum dots. She designed a quasi-two- temperature growth method to pattern GaN quantum dots, which improved their emission by a factor of ten. =Awards and honours= Oliver was elected a Fellow of the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining (FIMMM) in 2019.

It is native to North America and introduced in Europe. Description Underside of S. praealtum leaf, showing reticulate venation Symphyotrichum praealtum is a perennial, herbaceous plant with long rhizomes. The thick, firm leaves have conspicuous reticulate venation below. Flowering occurs from August to November, by which time the lower leaves are often withered. The dense arrays of flower heads are present on the upper, branched portion of the stem. The ray florets are pale violet or lavender and the disc florets are cream or pale yellow. Taxonomy Symphyotrichum praealtum was formerly included in the large genus Aster as Aster praealtus. However, this broad circumscription of Aster is polyphyletic and the North American asters are now mostly classified in Symphyotrichum and several other genera. Several varieties of Symphyotrichum praealtum have been recognised, but these are not consistently recognised. Hybridisation with Symphyotrichum lanceolatum and Symphyotrichum firmum has been reported. Distribution Willowleaf aster is native to much of the eastern and central United States, to the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Nuevo Leon, and to the extreme southern portion of Ontario, Canada. It has been introduced to central Europe. Habitat Symphyotrichum praealtum is found in moist, open habitats including wet prairies and meadows, shores, oak savannahs, ditches and roadsides. Periodic disturbance, such as wildfire, drought or human clearing, is required to maintain open habitats suitable for the species. Ecology Great golden digger wasp on S. praealtum flower Symphyotrichum praealtum spreads via rhizomes to form large clonal colonies. The species does not self-pollinate; cross-pollination with a genetically distinct plant is required for the production of seeds. The seeds are wind-dispersed. In some areas, this species may be the latest-flowering plant, which may limit the number of insects available to serve as pollinators. Conservation Willowleaf aster is considered globally secure. However, it is legally listed as endangered in New Jersey and threatened in Ontario. In Ontario it is threatened by habitat loss, invasive species, and a reduction or elimination of natural wildfire. There are under 15 populations known to remain in the province, most of which are within the city of Windsor. To protect these populations, tens of thousands of willowleaf aster plants were moved out of construction areas and replanted elsewhere during construction of the Rt. Hon. Herb Gray Parkway.

History The Criminal Minds were first formed in 1985 in Milton Keynes, and formed of the following members: DJ Halo, DJ Spatts, MC Iceski, Chase 1, Safe D, and CMD. They self- funded and self-released their first mini-album Guilty As Charged in 1990, followed by the EP Tales From the Wasteland. Both were hailed within the UK hip hop scene for their rap delivery and clever and diverse use of samples. Due to the complications with getting sample clearance for their releases, they were released in limited numbers only. As the rave scene gained momentum from 1991, The Criminal Minds teamed up with a local record shop DJ, to fuse their hip hop style with Breakbeat hardcore. This resulted in what is regarded as an all-time classic of the genre Baptised By Dub. For the next few years, a solid release of breakbeat hardcore and early jungle releases would follow. After a hiatus, The Criminal Minds regrouped to release Widowmaker in 2001. An anthology/compilation of The Criminal Minds hip hop output was finally released in 2011 by Rephlex Records.

The river's watershed drains the southern Washington portion of the Hozameen Range, and the western section of the North Cascades Scenic Corridor. The creek was named by three prospectors, John Sutter, George Sanger, and John Rowley, in 1872. Sutter believed he found a ruby in the creek, leading to the name, however the stone was actually a misidentified garnet.Mount Baker NP history files, Actg. Supervisor R.L. Fromme, Nov. 23, 1937, to Regional Forester, Portland. Retrieved 29 September 2018 Ruby Creek had an original length of approximately 11 kilometers, before the lower 6 kilometers were inundated by Ross Lake, reducing it to its current length of 5 kilometers. History Ruby Creek was first discovered in the summer of 1859 by most likely Henry Custer, however, there is a questionable account of prospectors in the area earlier that year. Ruby creek would not be visited again until the year of its naming 1872. In 1879 substantial amounts of gold were found in the creek, leading to its first mining claim \\"Nip and Tuck\\" and with it the start of the first gold rush in the North Cascades. In excess of 600 claims were filed, and between several hundred and 2,500 people worked the creek, however low profitability ended most mining by the fall of 1880. Small amounts of mining persisted in the area, most notably the Ruby Hydraulic Gold Mining Co. mine operating between the late 1890s and early 1900s located approximately two miles up the creek from its confluence with the Skagit River, the site was flooded by Ross Lake in 1947. The area was never heavily settled, however many cabins, and a store were constructed in the area during the gold rush period.

The building was designed by the Queensland Government Architect's Office. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011.  History  Originally known as the Goolman Division, the township of Boonah is located 84 km southwest of Brisbane. Established in 1882 as a service centre for the surrounding agricultural district, Goolman was renamed Boonah in 1937 (not to be confused with present-day Goolman, a suburb in the City of Ipswich). The Post and Telegraph Reserve was surveyed in 1888 and initially covered the entire town block on which the present building is located. The reserve was resurveyed and subdivided in May 1898 and finalised in October of the same year. The Boonah Post and Telegraph Office was built prior to 1900, probably between 1888 and 1898 (a date of 1893 is also possible). The front and side elevations were extensively remodelled in 1910-11 to standard plans of the period. In 1924 a telephone exchange was added to the southern side of the front portion of the building. Minor alterations were made to the verandah in 1948. The building was designed by the Queensland Government Architect's Office for both pre-1900 and 1910-11 phases, as this was prior to the Australian Government taking responsibility for the design and construction of post offices.  Description  Boonah Post Office is at 1 Park Street, Boonah, comprising the whole of Lot 1 RP128181. The Boonah Post Office is on a gently graded, regularly-shaped corner site which is defined on the east by the town's principal commercial and retail street, High Street, and on the north by Park Street. The original plan of subdivision, dated 1888 indicates that the rear of the site was flanked by the railway line and reserve, though this is now the location of Yeates Avenue. The original post office building is raised substantially above street level and the frontage addresses High Street, though the main verandah, private post box area and access is now via the Park Street frontage. The original quarters component is attached to the western side of the post office building, and is set back from the Park Street frontage. Vehicular access to the site is via an asphalted driveway at the northwest corner which is enclosed by a non-original chainwire fence. The site is flanked to the west by the Boonah State School and to the south by mixed commercial and retail development. The precinct is defined by the double-storey Victorian-era Commercial Hotel on the opposite corner. Though the Boonah Post Office and Quarters were built in the late 1800s, the office exterior as now viewed from High Street results mostly from alterations completed around 1910-11 and 1924. The Park Street side, with its bungalow-styled quarters and projecting wing, still appears largely as constructed. This elevation consists of a symmetrical verandah for the quarters, set back from the street, with a near-pyramidal hipped timber-framed roof clad with corrugated galvanised iron. A smaller trailing kitchen wing containing the former kitchen, servants' room and pantry is set back from the front of the quarters, but is linked to it externally by a continuation of the verandah. This is juxtaposed on the eastern side of the bungalow with the post office block projecting forward, also with a hipped roof, and with a pair of tall double-paned windows. A non-original ramp extends across this section, with balustrade and vertical boarding underneath to match the original. The High Street side has an asymmetrical elevation beginning, for circulation purposes, with a corner porch in similar detailing to the quarters verandah. This joins the projecting bays on the Park and High street sides and was altered at an early date to accommodate private letter box bays; an original window in the east elevation has been infilled and polished timber paired double doors have been added. The 1910s post office public space is marked out with a gabled breakfront to High Street, the gable being drawn together with a plank screen suggesting half-timbering, and a label-shaped window head bearing the post office name. The window below is a five-sash casement design with windows subdivided in the free-style proportion. In addition the lower panes are each bisected with a horizontal and vertical glazing bar, an unusual detail. To the south of the projecting bay, the interwar-era telephone exchange wing is typical of Queensland post office buildings of the time, with hipped roof, casement sash windows and more austere detailing. The original post office now houses the post office public and counter areas with the 1920s public area and telephone exchange now converted to the mail room and staff room. The areas were probably refurbished in later years and again when Australia Post standardised its retail areas. Immediately behind the post office, the former four-roomed quarters component has been converted to a Post Master's office, store room, mail room and mail contractor's sorting rooms. The original verandah on the southern side of the building has been converted to storage and staff amenities. The trailing service wing comprising the former servant's room, kitchen and pantry is presently being used for storage and as a bike shed. = Original fabric = The original fabric of the building which survives includes: * Structural frame: Timber floor, wall and roof framing on timber pole stumps. * External walls: Variously straight and chamfered profile timber weatherboard cladding to stud-framed areas indicating various periods of construction; verandah areas have exposed vertical and diagonal studs; the sub-floor spaces are enclosed by vertical timber battens. * Internal walls: Variously lined with horizontal or vertical beaded and V-jointed timber lining boards; some rooms have expressed hardwood stud frame. Walls to original kitchen range alcove are lined with corrugated galvanised iron. * Floor: Timber floor boards with moulded timber skirting boards. * Ceiling: Beaded timber board-lined ceilings with timber quad cornices; circular timber ceiling vent covers. * Roof: Hipped form with pyramidal form to quarters component; integral verandahs; all clad with corrugated galvanised iron. Timber-lined eaves soffits. Decorative metal ridge ventilators on post office and quarters components. Front gable introduced in 1910-11 works. * Other: The original side and front elevations have timber-framed double-hung sash windows with two-light sashes and timber reveals. The 1910 alterations which survive include: * a front gable with half-timbering, building inscription \\"BOONAH POST OFFICE\\" and a five-sash casement window bay to the front elevation * Timber-framed verandahs integral with main roof and finished with timber balustrade with lattice infill (lattice screens later introduced above balustrade). * Internal doors which are variously four-panelled timber with glazed operable fanlight over or ledged and braced timber construction. * Original quarters kitchen with wood- fired range and surrounding walls clad with corrugated galvanised iron * Grounds originally enclosed by timber picket fence. = Condition = The original design of Boonah Post Office was a simple, asymmetrically-composed porch and gable building with a small postal hall and large quarters component behind. The planning arrangement is assumed to have provided dual but independent operation of the postal and telegraphic functions around the single postal hall and counter with minimal space for mail sorting, telegraphic functions and staff facilities. The key alteration to the building concerns the enlargement and remodelling of the frontal component to provide an enlarged public space and telephone exchange facilities, and later the removal of the telegraphic function. Notwithstanding the changed pattern of circulation and use, the external presentation of the building is able to demonstrate key aspects of the original design and planning, particularly in relation to the quarters component, and subsequent phases of development, including the hipped and gabled roof form, the raised weatherboarded frontage to the street and various timberwork details. Alterations include the addition of the disabled ramp to the northeast corner, alterations to the south verandah and installation of private letter box bays. As noted above, the building's original plan form has been altered by the removal of walls throughout the frontal office component, alterations to the south verandah and the demolition of a small lean-to to the western end. In general, however, the integrity of the quarters plan form, the reverse timber-boarded construction of the walls (exposed frame with belt rail), boarded ceiling, decorative ceiling vents, and raked bulkheads remains intact, and serve to demonstrate the aesthetic quality and configuration of the original interior spaces. While altered over a substantial period of time, and despite the use and pattern of circulation being altered in part, Boonah Post Office maintains a reasonable ability to demonstrate the legibility of its original design and manner of construction. Externally and internally the building appears to be in sound condition, well maintained and with no major defects visible.  Heritage listing  The significant components of Boonah Post Office include the evolved postal building and former quarters comprising fabric from the late 19th century fabric through to 1952. Boonah Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion B: Rarity In the state context, Boonah Post Office remains as the state's oldest functioning timber post office with a rare relatively intact nineteenth century quarters component. It is also, possibly, the earliest known \\"Turn of the Century Transitional\\" type post office, as identified in the Historic Post Offices in Queensland A National Estate Study, 1983. Criterion D: Characteristic values Boonah Post Office is an example of: * a post and telegraph office with quarters (second generation typology 1870-1929) * a transitional timber form with semi-detached office and bungalow quarters with a later projecting gable. * the work of the Queensland Government Architect's office under Alfred Barton Brady Typologically, Boonah Post Office, built between 1893 and 1898, was constructed at the midpoint of a second typology of post offices between 1870 and 1929. These post offices generally incorporated a separate component for the telegraph functions in addition to residential quarters. In this instance, the postmaster's residence was provided in a semi-detached building, allowing enlarged telegraph facilities. The key alteration to the building concerns the enlargement and remodelling of the frontal component to provide an enlarged public space and telephone exchange facilities, and later the removal of the telegraphic function. While the alterations have altered the appearance of the frontal component in particular, the quarters remain largely intact and the overall typology is still readable. In the state context, Boonah is also a member, possibly the earliest example, of a post office type known as T14 (Turn of the Century Transitional) a relatively small number of which were built throughout Queensland during 1896-1900. Architecturally and stylistically, Boonah Post Office is an amalgam of at least three building programs, but with a core of late nineteenth century characteristics. While the main alterations carried out in 1910-11 introduced a gabled bay, this element was in the mode which had already been in favour since around 1900 and used within the type, as seen at the contemporary types constructed in Esk (1900) and Tambo (1904). While partially altered in plan form and function, it retains the principal aspects of its original compositional detail and fabric. This includes its presentation as a raised timber weatherboard structure with simple decorative detail. The overall composition and aesthetic qualities are generally modest in line with its type, with the timberwork details well executed, if common, including the simple bargeboard, exposed rafter ends, grouped window joinery, half-timbering, and internal ceiling vents.

She was also the founder, publisher, and owner of a newspaper (The Western Progress) and a magazine (American Sketch Book). Swisher was connected with the Daily La Crosse Democrat, The Western Progress, Pioneer Press, and the St. Paul Chronotype. Besides her journalistic writings, she published several books of non-fiction, novels, and poetry. Some of them included, History of Brown County, Wisconsin, in several volumes, Struggling up to the Lights, Homeless Thought at Home, Cassie, The Story of a Woman's Love, and Rocks and Shoals. Early years and education Isabella (\\"Bella\\") Russell French was born December 1837, at Trenton, Georgia. On her mother's side, she was related to Generals Jacob Brown and Henry Lee III, of Revolutionary era. Her grandfather, Capt. William Lee, commanded the first passenger boat that made the tour of the Great Lakes. Her father was an architect and inventor, of considerable renown, who was unfortunately stripped of quite a fortune by the great overflow of the Mississippi River in 1851; and three years later, he started for England to recover some portion of his mother's estate, but was lost at sea, or supposed to have been, as he was never heard of thereafter. Then came, for the family, weary years of battle with want. Before Bella was fourteen, she sewed from early morning till lights grew dim, at shirt making, to keep herself and family from starvation. Being obliged to leave school, she pursued her studies at night, with her books open before her while she worked. It is said \\"she made rhymes before she could speak plain, and played at writing stories before she could form a letter.\\" Career After she went north with relatives, a sister died, then a brother during the Civil War, fighting for the Union, and a few months later the mother died. Swisher taught a little school, and saved enough money to enable her to attend a course at the University of Iowa, which fitted her for her destined work to be a poet. In 1867, Brick Pomeroy, recognizing her genius in a short story that she sent him, employed her on the Daily LaCrosse Democrat. Two years later, she started The Western Progress, a weekly newspaper at Brownsville, Minnesota, which she owned, and edited for two years, and then sold to take a position on the editorial staff of the St. Paul Pioneer Press. She was editor of the first literary magazine in Minnesota, The Busy West, also editor of the St. Paul Chronotype. In 1874, she started the American Sketch Book, an eighty-page historical magazine, at La Crosse, Wisconsin, which, on account of ill health, she removed to Texas in 1877, when she was forty years of age. During the same year, 1877, she was associate editor of the Texas New Yorker published at Galveston, and editor of the Sketch Book in Austin, Texas. In October, 1878, she married Col. John Milton Swisher (1819‚Äì1891), of Austin, a man sympathetic in his literary tastes, and abundant in his material wealth. Two years later, she established a health spa, the \\"Thermo Water Cure or Hot Air Bath and Hygienic Institute\\", for those who suffered from neuralgia, paralysis, and rheumatism. In 1882, on account of family cares and sickness, she was obliged to suspend the Sketch Book. Among her published works were the History of Brown County, Wisconsin, in several volumes, Struggling up to the Lights, Homeless Thought at Home, Cassie, The Story of a Woman's Love, and Rocks and Shoals. Her obituary in The Austin Weekly Statesman (1893) mentioned that two posthumous volumes would be published, one a work on the symbology of the Bible, the other a collection of poems. Swisher and her husband were both members of the Texas Esoteric Society. She studied painting under some of the best artists in the United States, and painted landscapes and portraits that commanded admiration. She was remembered as a sort of universal genius: she cooked a dinner, made a dress, nailed up a broken fence, harnessed her horses for a drive, edited a paper, wrote a story, and then entertained with her verses in the afternoon. She was at one time a prominent lecturer. The couple resided in Austin until the husband died in 1890, when she removed to Sausalito, California. She died September 28, 1893, at her residence in Sausalito, and was buried at Mountain View Cemetery, Oakland, California.

It bore the name Gymnasium Osdorf until 1 January 2007, when it officially adopted the name of the Austrian-Swedish nuclear physicist Lise Meitner. History The founding of the Gymnasium took place on 1 April 1970. At that time, the lessons were not yet held in today's classrooms, but in those of today's Realschule Goosacker. For the school year 1971/1972 only three classes remained at Goosacker, the other six moved into the rooms on the Hemmingstedter Weg, where today the ZSU (Center for School Biology and Environmental Education) is located. At this time, the school without a strong base already had 216 students. The new building at the street of Knabeweg, where the school is located today, was inaugurated on 5 February 1973. At the beginning of the new school year, however, lack of space prevailed on the site, which consisted of only one H-building, in which the majority of students is still located today. Due to the lack of space, some classes had to move back into the ZSU. The lack of space was corrected in 1974, when a building for the students of the upper school (December), and a specialist building (April) were completed. The construction of the administrative building of the school was completed in May 1976. Since 1976, members of the 10th grade travel to Margate every year for about one and a half weeks. In 1981, a large sports hall was completed, which is often rented by clubs over the weekend for tournaments. The hall can be divided into three parts, which allows three classes at the same time to exercise in a school lesson. Since the sports hall is largely powered by solar energy and the environment working group pays attention to the cleanliness and the environmental protection on the grounds, the school was awarded several times as \\"Environmental School in Europe\\" by the Foundation for Environmental Education.Hamburg: \\"Schul-Oscar\\" und \\"Beste Ganztagsschule\\" 2017, Ganztagsschulen.org In 1995, the school administration celebrated its 25th anniversary together with representatives of the partner schools. In 1998, 1999, 2001 and 2003, the school took school trips just before the summer holidays. Another is planned for 2006. In 2001, the event of the \\"Aulalauf\\" took place for the first time. The run was supposed to collect donations so that the school could start building an assembly hall, as the break room had become too small for official occasions. 2004/2005 the school was nearing its end: A plan was announced by the Hamburg Education Authority after which the Gymnasium Osdorf, the junior high school Goosacker and the primary school Wesperloh should merge as a \\"school network Hamburg-West\\".Zukunft der Schule Goosacker und der Schulen in den RSK-Gebieten 6 und 7, spd-fraktion-hamburg.de The conversion to a comprehensive school could only be averted by strong protest from students, school management and parents. However, since the school year 2005/2006 several school classes from Goosacker are located at Lise-Meitner-Gymnasium and the school management has been partially merged. The project of the construction of a new assembly hall was discontinued in 2006, through an arrangement with the education authority, the school gets by grants the remaining money for the construction. On 1 January 2007, the final renaming of Gymnasium Osdorf in Lise-Meitner-Gymnasium took place. The high school bears an intensified mathematical-scientific profile. On 23 January 2018, German Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited the school and held a discussion with higher grade pupils.Deutschlandreise des Bundespr√§sidenten: Antrittsbesuch in Hamburg, Bundespraesident.deSteinmeier zufrieden mit Hamburg-Besuch, NDR.de Partnership schools * L√©on, Nicaragua, since 1974 * Lyakirimu, Tansania, since 1989 * Moscow, Russia, since 1992 In the partnership with the Lyakirimu Secondary School, Tansania, there has been a lively exchange between the two schools.

The novel switches between the two women's perspectives intermittently during the novel. One chapter of the novel is told from the perspective of YoonHui, Emi's daughter. The novel includes a map from 1943, further readings, and a notable dates section. Taking place in Korea, White Chrysanthemum is about two sisters named Hana and Emi that are separated by World War II. The sisters are haenyeo - free divers - and belong to a strong female community. At the age of 16 years old, Hana is taken away by a Japanese soldier to become a comfort woman. The novel focuses on the experiences of comfort women and how the war impacted different hierarchies of individuals from multiple perspectives. The dual timeline gives a perspective as events unfold through Hana's experience in the 1940s and a later perspective in 2011 from Emi's experience.  Plot Summary  The novel begins with the two sisters on the beach of Jeju Island; Hana is with her mother as she dives for abalone and Emi is waiting on the sand. Hana swims toward Emi as a soldier approaches, and hides her sister as the man talks to her. He is a Japanese soldier named Corporal Morimoto, and has Hana taken with him, leaving her sister behind. The novel then splits between the two women as Hana becomes a comfort woman and Emi searches for her sister sixty years later. = Hana's Perspective (1940s) = Hana is brought to a police station where she maintains the lie that she told Corporal Morimoto, that her family is dead, by giving a false last name so they cannot locate them. Hana and other girls are led into a room where they are to re-dress in clothing before they are put in a truck. Hana is separated from the group and is brought to a ferry with other comfort women who were stored inside and being transported to an undisclosed location. Hana is raped by Corporal Morimoto, making this her first sexual experience. She is then returned to the rest of the women as they arrive to a train depot. Once boarded with soldiers to keep guard, the women on the train learn that they are headed to Manchuria where she is then taken to a brothel. The next morning, the local soldiers learn of the arrival of a new comfort women, prompting them to visit Hana. Corporal Morimoto visits Hana each night he is on duty and rapes her. Hana flees the brothel after remaining there for a period of time, only to be caught by Corporal Morimoto. He tells her that he is taking her to Mongolia. When she is brought to Mongolia, she stays with two men and a woman. She is unable to communicate with them because she does not speak Mongolian. Corporal Morimoto leaves for a period of time, and Hana begins to learn terms in Mongolian and about the people she is staying with. Morimoto comes back, and Hana tries to run away on horseback. Morimoto eventually catches up to her, but the two are taken by Soviet soldiers. The soldiers kill Corporal Morimoto, and release Hana to the Mongolian family. They bring her back to the place they live. The novel, from Hana's perspective, ends with her swimming in Lake Uvs. = Emi's Perspective (2011) = Emi is beginning her dive as a haenyeo woman with JinHee, a fellow diver. Emi talks about a dream she often has where she is standing on a cliff and hears a girl's voice calling for her that is familiar but strange. Emi is revealed to be seventy seven years old, and talks about diving being a gift that her mother taught her. Emi talks about how she does not visit her children often because she has a distant relationship with them. She takes a taxi and then an airplane to Seoul to visit her daughter YoonHui, her son Hyoung, and her grandson YoungSook. JinHee convinced Emi to go to the inaugural ceremony of the Jeju Peace Park that commemorates the 1948 Jeju Uprising. The 1948 Jeju Uprising led to the massacre of over twenty thousand islanders, according to Emi. She recalls how her family home was burned when she was fourteen years old. When she attended the event, she noticed how everyone was carrying the same flowers, white chrysanthemums, which are a symbol of mourning. Emi is at the one thousandth Wednesday Demonstration that has happened since 1992. She remembers how in 1948, before the Korean War had begun, her father had his throat slit by a policeman in front of her and her mother. Her and her mother fled to a cove and ate the insects, moss, and creatures that were in the cove. When they were on the brink of starvation, they returned to their destroyed house. Policemen discovered them and brought them to a police station. The man who had brought them to the station, HyunMo, forced Emi to marry him. When Emi is back in the present moment of the Demonstration, Emi meets a group of older women and asks if they knew a Hana. They answer by saying that they were named after flowers, but did not know each other's real names. They talk of women being taken from various locations, such as China, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Dutch women. They talked of the first comfort woman to come forward, Kim Hak-sun in 1991. The Demonstration continues, and there is a statue of peace that Emi knows is of Hana. Emi tells her children that she was not an only child, and that she did not tell them because of shame. She reveals that her sister, Hana, sacrificed herself to save her. Hyoung asks Emi why she hated their father. She reveals to her children that they did not marry out of love but because of the war. She was fourteen when she was married. Emi did not believe that he married her for love; only for her family's land. She was pregnant at sixteen and afraid of being a mother. After learning that HyunMo had her mother killed, she told her son that he was the only thing that kept her from killing herself. Her son was born the year the Korean War begun. When her husband was on his deathbed, he thanked her for their children, he said he always loved her in his own way, asked that she not hate him so much after he dies, that she light incense for his ancestors, and that she forgive him for everything. Emi visits the statue again with her children. She says that it is her sister Hana. She tells YoonHui that she was proud that she went to university, and that she was proud of her son. Emi thinks to herself that she has finally found Hana. = YoonHui's Perspective (2012) = YoonHui is in the sea and wants to dive to remember what it is like to be a haenyeo like her mother. JinHee is with her, and YoonHui uses her mother's mask. JinHee tells her that Emi was proud of her. YoonHui visited the statue after her mother had died with Lane and her nephew. Her nephew pointed out that someone had left flowers; they were white chrysanthemums. Lane found the artist that made the statue and they shared a black and white photograph that inspired the statue. It was from the daughter of a woman who was captured by Russian soldiers during World War II and had donated it to the Museum of Sexual Slavery. It had the label of haenyeo girl, with the date 1993. YoonHui tells the statue goodbye Aunt Hana.  Style  Mary Lynn Bract said in an interview that the authors she either had previously read or read while working on this novel were Toni Morrison, Kyung-Sook Shin, Annie Proulx, Muriel Barbery, Marilynne Robinson, Maya Angelou, Michael Ondaatje, George Orwell, Helen Dunmore, Kimiko Hahn, and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. She states that reading good writing can lead to creativity, so she picks up books if she is ever stuck so she can think of where she wants her books to go and how to get them to go in that direction.  Reception  Kirkus Reviews attributes the author with writing the novel in a \\"lyrical\\" manner while integrating historical events, however, it is \\"relentlessly and explicitly brutal [that] it runs the risk of numbing, or perhaps exhausting, the reader\\". The Guardian comments on how the author demonstrates pain through her characters, and how the novel \\"forces us to confront the inescapability of these traumas\\". The Guardian continues to remark that \\"the novel will affect readers differently, depending on their background\\". Asian Review of Books considers the novel to be \\"thought- provoking\\" for its incorporation of politics, \\"the personal and familial\\", and the \\"horrific\\" that may contribute to the remembrance of comfort women so that they are not forgotten. The Irish Times characterizes the novel as having \\"the starkness of witness literature\\" yet encounters moments of \\"awkwardness\\" in the author's style when authorial tone takes the place of voices of the characters.

It was designed by Rosenthal, Rutledge & Beattie and built by Beat Bros in 1929. Since 2005, the 1929 building has supported a high rise apartment building on top of it, designed by Tonkin Zulaikha Greer. The 1929 building replaced an earlier 1824 church on an adjacent site - the first Presbyterian church in Sydney, founded by John Dunmore Lang - which was resumed and demolished for construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Wynyard railway station. History =Old church (1826‚Äì1926)= right Scots Church is located in a part of the city known historically as Church Hill; an important place in Sydney's fabric from the foundation of European settlement. The colony's first church, St Philip's Anglican Church, was built on this hill in the 1790s. A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built near the hill in the 1820s and the foundation stone for the original Scots Church was laid in July 1824, opening on 16 July 1826. It was the first Presbyterian church erected in the city, founded by John Dunmore Lang who had arrived in the colony in 1823. St Patrick's, the Roman Catholic church on the northern side of Church Hill, was built in the 1840s. The original church was built at the cost of , with seating for 900 people. It was built in the Norman-Gothic style, \\"typical of the rural churches in Scotland\\". Lang was the church minister until his death in 1878. The church also held the Presbyterian Church offices from 1892 to 1904. Short-term ministers under Lang, or while he was absent, included Barzillai Quaife (1846-1847) and John Reid (1858-1862). The original church celebrated its centenary in 1926. In 1926, the NSW Government began resuming both the Scots Church and the church offices in York Street for the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge roadworks and Wynyard Station, a process that would take until 1929. Demolition was to begin on 30 November 1926. The old church held its final services on 28 November 1926. It had seen only five ministers in over a century: Lang (to 1878), A. Milne Jarvie (to 1886), W. M. Dill-Macky (to 1913), Thomas Tait (1925‚Äì1933) and Henry Robert Grassick (until closure). Another Scots Church clergyman, 1882‚Äì1893, was John Young Wai. =New church (1929‚Äìpresent)= The current church, pictured in 2008. A complex series of real estate transactions, land swaps and compensation agreements enabled the Presbyterian Church to reconstruct their church and offices on the original but enlarged site, facing both Lang Park and Wynyard Park, with frontages to Jamieson, York, and Margaret Streets. An architectural competition was held in 1927 for designs for a new Presbyterian Assembly Hall and associated offices. The brief called for a building which would be a monument appropriate to the universal character and inherent nobility of Presbyterianism; a material consummation of the church's pioneer efforts in this new world of Australia, and an appreciation of the substance and vitality which actuate the church towards problems of the future. Twenty- seven designs were submitted in the first stage of the competition and were judged by Norman Weekes. The winning design was selected in May 1928 but it was not until April 1929 that tenders were called and work commenced on the site in July 1929. On completion the Church and Assembly Hall became a popular venue for both ecclesiastic and secular activities. The new church could accommodate 1,350 people, and tablets and monuments from the old church were incorporated in the new building. However, the decision to co-locate the church administration in the same building as the new church would cause numerous issues in the decades to come. By the 1930s, the church had suffered a period of declining congregations, during which it had, according to the church's interim moderator, \\"almost passed out of existence\\". In response, it instituted a policy of not having a permanent minister, but instead engaging ministers from Scotland for six-month terms. This was reported to have been successful in driving interest in the church, which in 1935 was described as having \\"the largest [collection], possibly, of any Presbyterian church in Australia\\". In 1956, Malcolm Mackay became the first Australian-born minister at the church. Throughout the decades following the construction of the new church, the church struggled with tensions relating to the fact that it did not control its own building. The original congregation trustees of the church had transferred control of the new building to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church on the provision that suitable arrangements would be made for carrying on the operations of the congregation. However, the result of the agreement was that the church had a limited right of occupancy over the building, and could only use it on specific days. This caused a long-running dispute across several decades, finally resulting in legal action and the church vacating the building 1970s. The congregation initially moved to the St Patrick's church, moving thereafter to several other buildings in Sydney. By the 1990s, there were questions over the building's future, and its owner, the Presbyterian Church of New South Wales, initiated a series of redevelopment proposals. By 1998, when the last tenants were evicted, it was home to an 80-person congregation, which was forced to move to a church in Devonshire Street, artists and community groups, who were confined to the first two floors, with the upper storeys having been closed for some years. By the time of its eventual redevelopment, it had undergone several years of disuse and had been deconsecrated. In 1992, the church proposed to immediately demolish the building and build an 18-storey office complex, which met with strong council opposition and a trade union \\"green ban\\" and eventually did not proceed. In 1995, it was proposed to develop 13-storey office complex behind the existing facade, which collapsed when the intended tenant, the private training institute Australian Academy, withdrew from the proposal. Proposals continued throughout the remainder of the 1990s. In 2001, building owners the Presbyterian Church of New South Wales sold the then-disused church site to a subsidiary of developer Westpoint Corporation, retaining a strata title over the existing church building, which was to be retained in any redevelopment. It was eventually redeveloped in 2005, with 148 apartments built on top of the existing church. The restoration, funded by the redevelopment, faced challenges due to the building's disused state: contractors responsible for the renovation described \\"leaky ceilings, crumbling sandstone and damaged timber and metalwork\\", and having to sift through the contents of a floor \\"strewn with rubbish\\", among other issues. The restoration won the MBA Construction Awards restoration of a historic building up to $5 million award in 2006. A new \\"Trinitarian, Bible-Based, Presbyterian\\" church began operating in the Scots Church building in 2017. Description Scots Church, located opposite Wynyard Park, diagonally opposite St Phillip's Church, has three main components: The Assembly Hall, secondary meeting halls and offices for use by the church, and office space for general leasing. The Assembly Hall is a large, two storey, elliptical space of unique design located in the middle of the building and occupying the full width of the site. The facade is designed in Gothic style with ashlar sandstone and a granite base. It comprises five floors with a raised central section of six floors on the north and south facade. The long elevation is divided into three bays separated by recessed courts. Each bay is divided into three divisions. The lower two floors have arched windows with the recessed bays marked by pediments. The upper facade comprises a series of tripartite flathead windows, with bay divisions expressed by buttresses. Gothic detailing in the form of gargoyles, quatrefoil tracery, and sandstone proliferate. Significance Scots Church is a six- storey building of Inter war Gothic style. Scots Church has exceptional historic importance for its ability to embody the longevity of the association of this site with the Presbyterial Church. As well as recalling the early nineteenth-century history of this area as Church Hill, the building also has a powerful ability to reflect the impact made on the city by the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The building is important in the professional work of the noted architectural partnership of Rosenthal, Rutledge and Beattie. The building is architecturally significant as a rare and outstanding example of a highly intact original commercial Gothic exterior and an interior of high quality design with outstanding potential, due to its intact condition, to be maintained in its original state. The building is well resolved in its detailing in both its interior and exterior, and is particularly noted for its unique auditorium design. The building is aesthetically significant for its contribution as a landmark building to the Wynyard Square streetscape. It is also significant as the winner of the 1927 competition judged by N. Weekes. The building is socially significant as a popular venue for both ecclesiastical and secular activities, over many years. The Assembly Hall has considerable social importance for its contribution to the cultural diversity of the city.

It was built 1847-1849 by Edward Hunt; the design is uncertain, but has been attributed to John Verge. Among its notable residents was Henry Parkes, tenant from 1888 to 1892. The villa replaced an earlier building known as Hampton Cottage. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 May 2005.  History  Hampton Villa was built between 1847 and 1849 by the prominent Sydney cabinet maker, Edward Hunt. Hunt had arrived in Sydney with his brother Charles in 1814 and quickly rose to prominence within the community. In 1820 he was a member of the committee of the Sydney Bible Association, a subscriber to the Benevolent Society from 1821, contributed to the building of the Scots Church in Sydney and in 1827 was appointed to the Wesleyan Auxiliary Missionary Society. In 1842 he was elected as one of the first aldermen of the City of Sydney. In 1858 was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council. Edward Hunt possibly occupied the property of Hampton Villa from as early as 1840 at the peak of his business success, influence and affluence. At this time, a small weatherboard cottage with associated outbuildings and stables, known as Hampton Cottage, existed on the site, which may have been built by Hunt. Ownership of the property changed in quick succession during the early 1800s between real estate speculators before it was purchased by Hunt in 1847. In 1801 the 1800 land grant to William Balmain was transferred to John Gilchrist, to discharge Balmain's debts to Gilchrist. Gilchrist sold the original land grant in six parcels, including three lots to Thomas Hynde in 1837. Ownership was transferred in 1840 to John Terry Hughes who headed a consortium of speculators, and was again transferred in 1841 to Adolphus William Young when Hughes defaulted on his loan from Young. In 1847 Hunt purchased Lots 1-3 and 5 of Young's subdivision. The land title deeds were held by Young until the purchase price of 1,100 pounds (plus additional interest etc.) was repaid by Hunt to Young in 1851. Hunt appears to have been the first owner of the property to repay the loan for its purchase or other loans on the property and to therefore retain its ownership. Edward Hunt and his widow owned and occupied Hampton Villa for 35 years, and the Hunt family owned the property for nearly 50 years. Edward Hunt is believed to have built Hampton Villa in 1847-1849, a sandstone gentleman's residence with attic. The design of the villa has been attributed to the prominent Sydney architect, John Verge, although not conclusively established. John Verge practiced from 1831-1838, with some of his commissions completed after 1838 by his assistant, John Bibb. Verge became the most sought-after domestic architect from this period, who designed gentleman's residences for the elite of Sydney society. Edward Hunt, a leading cabinet maker, and John Verge, the leading architect of the time, are known to have had several clients in common amongst the elite of Sydney who could afford to commission their work. A further connection between Hunt and Verge is that Hunt hired Verge to build his Jamieson Street showroom and house in 1833. The success and influence of Edward Hunt during this period also makes it probable that he would commission the leading and most sought- after architect of the time to build his home. In addition to the connections between Verge and Hunt, the physical fabric of Hampton Villa supports that the building was designed by John Verge because it combines many of the characteristics that are known to be typical of works by Verge. These include the use of sandstone quoining and very fine ashlar construction, the stone- flagged verandah, the depth of the verandah, the hipped roof, the generous proportions of rooms, the exceptionally high ceilings for the period (14 feet), the exceptionally fine cedar joinery that is a dominant feature of the interiors, the use of French doors with slender glazing bars and louvred shutters, the non-glazed kick-panels in the French doors (a Verge trademark), the elevated situation of building with a commanding hill top view, and the careful situation of the building within a planned and ordered landscape. Moreover, the overall quality and combination of these elements is indicative of a highly skilled architect, of whom there were few in the subject period, and no others known with the reputation of Verge. Both the sandstone Hampton Villa and the 1840 timber Hampton Cottage remained on the allotment for some time. Between 1851 and 1856, Hunt purchased a number of the surrounding lots accumulating approximately 3.5 acres (1.4 ha) occupying all the land between Adolphus Street and Camerons Cove. Hunt died in the house in December 1866, after which his widow Hannah continued to live there until 1872. In 1872 Hampton Villa was leased to businessman, etcher and gallery director Eliezer Levi Montefiori. Montefiori had relocated from Victoria, where he had helped found the Victorian Academy of Art and was a trustee of the Melbourne Public Library, Museums and National Gallery. In Sydney he joined with Thomas Sutcliffe Mort and others to found the NSW Academy of Art. Between 1871 and 1891 he was a director of the Pacific Fire and Insurance Co, and was one of the original founders of the National Art Gallery of New South Wales which opened in September 1880. In 1878 the extension of Ewenton Street to Grafton Street effectively split the property in two, leaving the house on the eastern portion of land. This represented the first of a number of future subdivisions of the property. In 1888, Sir Henry Parkes, Premier of New South Wales, moved in to Hampton Villa as a tenant. Parkes' residency at Hampton Villa coincided with a most tumultuous time in his political career and personal life. Parkes' first wife of 50 years, Clarinda, had died immediately prior to his move to Hampton Villa. In February 1889 he married his long-time mistress Eleanor Dixon, by whom he had three children. In May 1890 Parkes was thrown from a carriage in the city and broke his leg in two places, confining him to the house for two and half months and intermittently for the remainder of the year. During this time debates over the Constitutional Convention for Federation were taking place in the Parliament of New South Wales. Parkes kept in constant contact with the Parliament, with at least one cabinet meeting held at Hampton Villa during the year and ongoing official correspondence and government business being carried out from Parkes' study at the house. Parkes remained at Hampton Villa until 1892 when pressing financial problems forced Parkes to relocate to North Annandale. In 1893 the Hunt family subdivided the Hampton Villa estate and lots were sold by the Savings Bank of NSW. Hampton Cottage was demolished at this time. Hampton Villa was purchased by Frances Perry in 1897 and the Perry family lived there for 15 years. In 1912 the house was purchased by Frank Bourne Wilson, who retained the property until 1943 when it was passed to his son, who in turn sold it in 1947. Frank Wilson operated a knitting business from Hampton Villa, first from the old stone kitchen, and later from a small brick factory building constructed in the rear yard on the site of the former stables. The factory employed 52 female workers producing ladies knitwear. Initially trading as the Knitting Co, it was later renamed Wilson Baker knitting Co when control passed to Frank's brother Harold in partnership with others. As a family business the company prospered until a fire destroyed the factory in 1925. The company continued to trade on a reduced basis from Hampton Villa, as HS Wilson and Co, until being wound up around 1932. In April 1943 Frank Wilson gave the house to his son John Hector who sold it in May 1947. To this time the house had had only three owners in 100 years. Following Wilson's ownership, Hampton Villa was converted to flats until restoration in the later 1970s returned it to a private house, which it remains to this day.GML 2004 and Humphreys 2005  Description  =Villa= Hampton Villa is an early Victorian house, two storied, surrounded on three sides by a wide sandstone verandah. The main entrance door is a double six panelled door flanked by two pairs of shuttered French doors with panelling and margin bars. There are a further two pairs of French doors on each side verandah. The verandah ceiling is lined with painted timber boards and supported by regularly placed concrete columns. There is an attic storey above, with seven dormer windows, two each to the north, south and west and one to the east. The roof is of corrugated iron, replacing an earlier terracotta tile roof, which itself had replaced the original roof. The ground floor interior consists of four main rooms paired either side of a wide central corridor, which is divided by internal double doors. Each room is approximately 6 metres X 6 metres with high 4 metre ceilings. The rooms all have original fireplaces, cedar skirting boards and six panelled cedar doors. Likewise internal staircases are also of cedar. To the rear are pantry, laundry and bathroom to one side and kitchen, a second bathroom and dressing room to the other. These are contained within two additional wings constructed in 1988. The first floor is made up of five bedrooms and a sitting room plus bathroom. The site has some archaeological potential in terms of the former detached kitchen, stables and outbuildings, as well as potential remains of the cottage that predated Hampton Villa, close to the northern property boundary. Remains of the early twentieth century Knitting Factory may also be present.GML 2004 =Garden= A masonry fence defines the boundary. The villa is fronted with a sloping lawn. On its Grafton Street side a grove of Cocos Island (or Queen) palms, Syragus romannzoffianum flanks the house. The villa is located on the crest of a hill with commanding views over Sydney Harbour to the city.GML, 2004 = Modifications and dates = * 1840+: Hampton Cottage was on this site * 1847-9: villa is built. * 1851-56: Hunt purchased a number of the surrounding lots accumulating approximately 3.5 acres (1.4 ha) occupying all the land between Adolphus Street and Camerons Cove. * 1878: the extension of Ewenton Street to Grafton Street effectively split the property in two lots, leaving the house on the eastern portion of land.

North and south dormer windows were added at this stage. * 1988: two new wings added extending the bathroom and kitchen/family areas. Extensive work carried out in the garden as well. The verandah was re-laid with sandstone, replacing the original flag stones. Timber posts were replaced by concrete columns, the ceiling was lined and a triangular pediment was created over the entrance. Internally a new doorway was created between the lounge room and bedroom 1. Chimneys were replaced, rear staircase was rebuilt and an underground garage and storage area built beneath the front lawn.  Heritage listing  Constructed in 1847, Hampton Villa is a fine and rare surviving example of an early Victorian marine villa designed in the Georgian style situated on the waterfront of Sydney Harbour. Hampton Villa is associated with a number of prominent colonial personalities, most notably Sir Henry Parkes, who lived at Hampton Villa between 1888 and 1892 during his term as Premier of NSW; Edward Hunt, who built the house and was a councillor on the first Sydney Council and member of the Legislative Assembly; and Eliezer Montefiori a founder of the Art Gallery of NSW. Through its connection to Sir Henry Parkes, Hampton Villa is associated with the move towards Australian Federation, as it was the venue for at least one NSW Cabinet meeting and various government business during the 1890 constitutional debates. The house retains its visual relationship with the harbour and Sydney City and is a prominent landmark feature on the Balmain peninsula. The grandeur, quality and situation of the house provide evidence of the standing of the house's occupants and demonstrate the careful positioning of the villa in its original setting. The subdivision of the Hampton Villa estate is still visible in the surrounding street pattern and provides a good example of the 19th century encroachment of suburban development on early Sydney estates. Hampton Villa was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 May 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Hampton Villa has historical significance as one of the few remaining gentlemen's marine villas, from the early Victorian Period, on the Balmain peninsula. It displays the late nineteenth century subdivision pattern of Balmains' waterfront and demonstrates the encroachment of suburbia on colonial landscapes in Sydney. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Hampton Villa has strong historical associative significance as the home of Sir Henry Parkes, NSW Premier, and his family from 1888 to 1892. During this period Parkes was confined to Hampton Villa through injury and administered his office as Premier from the house. Parkes was a leading political figure in both NSW and national politics, being a prominent personality in the Federation movement. Parkes formulated parts of his Federation debate from the house and held at least one Cabinet meeting at Hampton Villa, during the time of the Constitutional debates in 1890. Hampton Villa was built by Edward Hunt, a councillor on Sydney's first city council and member of the Legislative Council. After Hunt, Elezier Montefiori, a founder of the National Art Gallery of NSW, also lived in Hampton Villa. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Hampton Villa has aesthetic significance as a well detailed gentlemen's marine villa of the early Victorian period in the Georgian mode. The building is of high quality construction and presents a strong visual and waterscape element. The building gives an insight into the construction and layout of an early Victorian house, while the surrounds and yard retain elements of its former setting. The house retains views from Sydney city and the Anzac Bridge, recalling its prominent setting overlooking the harbour. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Hampton Villa has social significance for its role in the lead up to the Federation of Australia as the home and office of Sir Henry Parkes. The subdivision of the estate in 1893 set the pattern of streets and waterfront allotments which are characteristic for this area of the Balmain peninsula. The site is also significant for the operation of the Knitting Co, which employed 52 local women in the early years of the twentieth century, making it one of the main employers of women in the Balmain area at this time. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Hampton Villa has technical and research potential as a relatively intact example of an early Victorian marine villa. Archaeological evidence of its stables, detached kitchen and associated outbuildings may also exist within the allotment. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Hampton Villa remains as a rare surviving example of an early Victorian marine villa on the Balmain peninsula. Throughout Sydney villas of this type are becoming increasingly rare. Its prominent position, and maintained views to the water are equally rare as modern harbourside development overshadows earlier surviving colonial structures. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Hampton Villa is a good representative example of an early Victorian gentleman's marine villa.

He is a furry orange creature with googly eyes who wears Flyers' gear. Gritty has been compared to the Phillie Phanatic, the mascot for the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team. He was created by Brian Allen of Flyland Designs with help from David Raymond, the first man to portray the Phillie Phanatic. Gritty was introduced on September 24, 2018. According to his official biography, Gritty emerged after construction at the Wells Fargo Center, the Flyers' home arena, disturbed his secret hideout. Within the months following his debut, he became an internet sensation and made appearances on several talk shows. Creation Prior to Gritty's debut, the Flyers were only one of two NHL teams without an official mascot, the other being the New York Rangers. The team previously had a mascot named Slapshot, but it only lasted one season, in 1976. The \\"Slapshot\\" name now belongs to the mascot of the Flyers' division rival, the Washington Capitals. The impetus for Gritty's creation was when the Flyers' marketing department attended the mascot events at the 2016 NHL All-Star Game in Nashville, Tennessee, and realized that they were missing out on all the marketing and community outreach programs that the league's mascots were generating for their respective teams. The Flyers then commissioned Brian Allen of Flyland Designs in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, to design Gritty in August 2018. David Raymond, who portrayed the Phillie Phanatic, consulted on Gritty's creation. The Flyers organization wanted Gritty to have a rather intimidating appearance, as \\"someone you'd high-five but not hug\\" according to Allen. Reception Gritty made his debut on September 24, 2018, and appeared on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon several days later. Many sources brought attention to his appearance, which could be construed as frightening, while The Guardian described him as an \\"acid trip of a mascot.\\" Gritty was lampooned on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver and Saturday Night Live. He was re-appropriated as a socialist and antifa meme in a manner similar to how Pepe the Frog was re- appropriated by various alt-right groups. In response, Sarah Schwab, director of marketing for the team, said Gritty was never intended to represent anything political, and that he was never left-wing or right-wing as he \\"doesn't know his right from his left\\". Response to Gritty's introduction was immediate and sharply mixed, with many fans on social media expressing bewilderment and some fright at his appearance. Public perception of Gritty became increasingly positive as Gritty's antics, which subverted the cuddly, family-friendly appearance and demeanor of other NHL mascots, gained more attention on social media. On September 24, 2018, a few minutes after Gritty's debut, Gritty appeared to threaten longtime Flyers rival Pittsburgh Penguins on Twitter. In his first on-ice appearance, Gritty fell while firing T-shirts into the crowd from a T-shirt cannon. In his second appearance on ice, Gritty body-checked contestants in a goalie race during an intermission and shot a Flyers staff member with a T-shirt cannon. Shortly after his debut, the residents of Philadelphia began to embrace Gritty. On October 24, 2018, the Philadelphia City Council passed a formal resolution honoring Gritty, declaring that he honored the city's spirit and passion. In November 2018, BBC News reported that Gritty had amassed almost 200,000 Twitter followers. On March 20, 2019, it was announced the NHL Player's Association had voted Gritty the number one mascot in the league. On October 13, 2019, the first ever ‚ÄúGritty anti-runners 5K‚Äù took place. This 5K race included Gritty‚Äôs favorite things along the track, including hot dogs, silly string, and a shrine to Claude Giroux. In November 2019, during a fan meet-and-greet between Gritty and Flyers season ticket holders, a fan reported that the Flyers employee portraying Gritty punched their 13 year old son in the back. After an internal investigation by the Flyers led to no other witnesses of such abuse, the fan reported the incident to the Philadelphia Police Department, which has led to its own investigation. On February 3, 2020, the Flyers employee portraying Gritty was officially cleared of any wrongdoing and charges were declined to be filed following an investigation conducted by the South Detectives Division of the Philadelphia Police Department.https://www.inquirer.com/business/comcast/flyers-gritty-assault- boy-philadelphia-police- investigation-20200122.htmlhttps://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2020/01/22/gritty- flyers-mascot-philadelphia-police-investigating-claim-physically-assaulted- teen-boy-during-photo- shoot/https://www.broadstreethockey.com/2020/1/23/21078804/everyone-is- talking-about-gritty-philadelphia-flyers-mascot-lawsuit References  Further reading  * External links * Category:Philadelphia Flyers Category:National Hockey League team mascots Category:Sports mascots in the United States ","title":"Gritty (mascot)"},{"id":"58611910","text":"The date of the regatta is always adjusted to the nearest full moon.

It is distinguished from other similar species of Dichanthelium by a combination of the following characters: * leave less than wide and less than 15-20 times as long as wide * leaves hairy * stem slender with narrowly ovoid panicle * spikelets with long, soft hairs up to in length * first glume narrowly ovate, reaching the middle of the spikelet Distribution Dichanthelium leibergii ranges north to Alberta, west to Kansas, and east to New York state. Although it is \\"fairly common\\" in Manitoba, it is a rare species across much of its range. It is state threatened in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio and state endangered in New York. It is extirpated in Pennsylvania. Ecology In the Chicago region, it is a highly conservative species, with a coefficient of conservatism of 10. It occurs in high-quality prairie remnants, including wet prairie, mesic prairie, gravel hill prairie, as well as dry-mesic black oak savannas and oak openings. In a North Dakota study, its coverage increased significantly following the application of prescribed burning. Conservation Leiberg's panicgrass is threatened by habitat fragmentation, destruction, and invasive species. Appropriate management to maintain and increase populations of Leiberg's panicgrass includes removal of woody and invasive plant populations, prescribed burning, and prairie restoration.

He witnessed confirmations of rights and donations to the abbey and obtained a life-lease grant of property from Abbott Suppo. He also had a strong connection to the abbey of F√©camp, where he was responsible for the benediction of John of Ravenna as abbott in 1028.Lucien Musset, Notules F√©campoises, Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© des antiquaires de Normandie, 54 (1957).He performed the rite in place of Robert, the archbishop of Rouen, probably because of the conflict between the latter and the duke. Later, he witnessed three life-lease agreements involving the abbey, including one that entitled him to the tithes of the town of Ryes and a manse of ten acres in the grounds of F√©camp. He was among the attendees to the Rheims Council in 1049, an event where churchmen had to decide between attending the council (and pleasing the Pope Leo IX) or the feudal levy (and pleasing the King Henry I). His episcopate is traditionally dated until 1060, but his last datable appearance is from 25 December 1054. Recueil des actes des ducs de Normandie de 911 √† 1066, ed.

The group comprises the Crato, Ipubi and Romualdo Formations and is dated to the Aptian to Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous. The formations of the group were deposited in a lacustrine to subtidal shallow marine environment in the Araripe rift basin.Santana Group at Fossilworks.org The Santana Group has provided a rich assemblage of fossils; flora, fish, arthropods insects, turtles, snakes, dinosaurs, such as Irritator, and pterosaurs, among which Thalassodromeus. The stratigraphic units of the group contained several feathers of birds, among those the first record of Mesozoic birds in Brazil. The Romualdo and Crato Formations are renowned for their excellent conservation and designated Lagerst√§tten. In 2006, the Araripe Basin was designated a UNESCO Global Geopark.  Description  The Santana Group was formerly described as belonging to the Araripe Group.Scherer et al., 2013, p.28 The fossiliferous Santana Formation was previously defined as containing the Crato and Romualdo Members, but redefinition of the stratigraphy led to the establishment of the Santana Group, replacing the middle part of the Araripe Group and the former Crato, Ipubi and Romualdo members were elevated to separate formations.Assine, 1992, p.291Fabin et al., 2018, p.2050 = Basin history = The tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Araripe Basin, located in the Borborema Geologic Province, encompasses four stages, with five tectonostratigraphic phases:Fabin et al., 2018, pp.2051-2052 1) Syneclise phase - Silurian to Devonian - characterized by tectonic quiescence in the Borborema Province. It is represented by the deposits of the Cariri Formation, that include medium to coarse-grained quartz sandstones, locally conglomeratic, deposited in large braided fluvial systems 2) Pre-rift phase - Tithonian - characterized by the mechanical subsidence due to lithosphere thinning that preceded the rift. It is represented by the Brejo Santo Formation, that comprises red shales and claystones, and the Miss√£o Velha Formation, constituted by medium to coarse-grained quartz-feldspathic sandstones, locally conglomeratic, that contains entire trunks and fragments of silicified wood (Dadoxilon benderi) conifer 3) Rift phase - Berriasian to Hauterivian - characterized by increasing mechanical subsidence that created a system of grabens and half grabens. It is represented by the Abaiara Formation, that includes shales, siltstones, sandstones and conglomerates 4) Post-Rift I phase - Aptian to Albian - characterized by thermal subsidence. The lowermost unit Barbalha Formation, represents a fluviolacustrine phase and is composed of red and gray shales, siltstones and claystones. The Santana Group was formed during this stage and comprises three stratigraphic units: * Crato Formation that is composed of six intervals of laminated limestones (C1 to C6), interbedded with calciferous siltstones and marls, and is very rich in fossils of vertebrate and invertebrate organisms * Ipubi Formation, that is mainly composed of organic-rich, black greenish bituminous shales, claystones and algal limestones that are interbedded with gypsum-anhydrite beds * Romualdo Formation, that represents a calciferous siliciclastic succession composed of fine to medium-grained sandstones, argillaceous siltstones, calciferous shales, and limestones, very rich in fossils. This formation recorded the marine proto-Atlantic incursion that involved the Araripe Basin, and other interior basins and created a large seaway throughout the Borborema Province during the Albian 5) Post-rift II phase - Albian to Cenomanian - characterized by a major sag phase, and is formed by two stratigraphic units: * Araripina Formation, that occurs in the western region of the basin and is composed by rhythmites and heterolithic layers of reddish, purplish and yellowish fine-grained sandstone and mudstone * Exu Formation, that comprises medium-to coarse grained sandstones, fine grained clayey sandstones and local conglomeratic beds  Fossil content  The upper and lower formations of the group are highly fossiliferous, with mainly insects, amphibians, fish,Fara et al., 2005, p.152Aparecida et al., 2015, p.25 and flora dominating the lower Crato Formation,Jorge de Lima et al., 2015, p.102 shrimps (Araripenaeus timidus),Pinheiro, 2014, p.4 and various genera of dinosaurs and fish in the Romualdo Formation.Weishampel et al., 2004, pp.563-570Cavalcanti Duque & Franca Barreto, 2018, p.9 A rich assemblage of pterosaur fossils are found in both formations,Elgin & Frey, 2011Martill, 2007, p.895 and the Ipubi Formation provided an indeterminate Pelomedusoides turtle.Ribeiro Oliveira et al., 2011, p.62 The Santana Group provided several feathers of birds, among those the first record of Mesozoic birds in Brazil.Prado et al., 2016, p.35  Gallery  Araripe Basin - depositional environments and sequence stratigraphy.jpgSchematic development of the depositional environments Araripe Basin - lake level cycles - Crato, Ipubi and Romualdo Formations.jpgLake level cyclicity Scotese 105 ma.pnglate Early Cretaceous (105 Ma) Santana Group - fossilized feathers and Dastilbe fossil.jpgFossil feathers and Dastilbe fossil  See also  * Chapada do Araripe * Ariri Formation * Guaruj√° Formation * Itapecuru Formation  References  = Bibliography =         Further reading        Category:Geologic groups of South America Category:Geologic formations of Brazil Category:Lower Cretaceous Series of South America Category:Cretaceous Brazil Category:Albian Stage Category:Aptian Stage Category:Shale formations Category:Sandstone formations Category:Mudstone formations Category:Siltstone formations Category:Marl formations Category:Limestone formations Category:Evaporite deposits Category:Lacustrine deposits Category:Shallow marine deposits Category:Landforms of Cear√° Category:Landforms of Pernambuco Category:Landforms of Piau√≠ Category:Northeast Region, Brazil ","title":"Santana Group"},{"id":"58612056","text":"The Jinbei S30 or Jinbei Zhishang S30 (ÈáëÊùØ Êô∫Â∞öS30) is a subcompact crossover SUV manufactured by Jinbei in China.
