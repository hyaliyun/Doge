The rock itself is a glacial deposit wedged in the mountain's crevasse. It is a popular tourist destination and is accessible without any climbing equipment. However, it is suspended above a deep abyss. It is also a popular site for BASE jumping. The boulder is just southwest of the village of Lysebotn, just south of the Lysefjorden. Geology Rogaland lies in a weak tectonic zone, allowing the river to dig into the surrounding sandstone mountain. During the several ice ages known to have occurred in Scandinavia, Norway was completely covered in glaciers. Between the ice ages, the meltwater formed and reformed the valley up to 22 times. After the last ice age, global warming caused a rise in sea level, flooding the fjords. The boulder was deposited during the last glacial period, at around 50,000 B.C. As the Norwegian Glacier melted, it was accompanied by a rebound in rock formations as the ice was removed. In Kjeragbolten's case, the rebound was faster than the rising sea level, which wedged the rock into its current position. Tourism Kjeragbolten has long been a famed photo op in the Kjerag trails. It was featured in the 2006 viral video Where the Hell is Matt? where traveler Matt Harding danced atop the precarious boulder. Because of its enormous popularity, long lines usually form with people who want to have a photo from the site. Expected waiting time can be anywhere from a few minutes to over an hour, especially when there are cruise ships in Stavanger.

After the foundation of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephony was established which further developed the country's Telecommunications Services. In 1961, the first automatic telephone switch service was introduced utilizing an electromechanical switch with a capacity of approximately 5000 lines. In 1971, a new government-controlled body, the Telecommunications Corporation (T.C.C) was set up to take over the day-to-day running of the communications services such as telephone, telegraph and telex. Also a satellite earth station at Baqa'a was in operation using Intelsat facilities. From 1973 to 1985, Jordan Telecom's network underwent significant expansion as part of a government investment program.

The gas/oil ratio (GOR) is the ratio of the volume of gas that comes out of solution, to the volume of oil at standard conditions. In reservoir simulation gas oil ratio is usually abbreviated R_s. A point to check is whether the volume of oil is measured before or after the gas comes out of solution, since the oil volume will decrease after the gas comes out. In fact gas dissolution and oil volume shrinkage will happen at many stages during the path of the hydrocarbon stream from reservoir through the wellbore and processing plant to export. For light oils and rich gas condensates the ultimate GOR of export streams is strongly influenced by the efficiency with which the processing plant strips liquids from the gas phase. Reported GORs may be calculated from export volumes which may not be at standard conditions. The GOR is a dimensionless ratio (volume per volume) in metric units, but in field units, it is usually measured in cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil or condensate. In the states of Texas and Pennsylvania, the statutory definition of a gas well is one where the GOR is greater than 100,000 ft3/bbl or 100 Kcf/bbl. The state of New Mexico also designates a gas well as having over 100 MCFG per barrel (http://www.nmcpr.state.nm.us/nmac/parts/title19/19.015.0002.htm) The Oklahoma Geologic Survey recently published Map of Oklahoma Oil and Gas Fields distinguished by Oil and Gas Ratio this map that defines a gas well as having greater than 20 MCFG per barrel of oil. They go on to define an oil well as having a GOR of less than 5 MCFG/BBL and an oil and gas well between 5 and 20 MCFG/BBl. In the newly proposed Information Collection Request for Oil and Gas Facilities (EPA ICR No. 2548.01, OMB Control No. 2060-NEW) the EPA has divided well types into five categories as such: 1\\\\. Heavy Oil (GOR ≤ 300 scf/bbl) 2\\\\. Light Oil (GOR 300 < GOR ≤ 100,000 scf/bbl) 3\\\\. Wet Gas (100,000 < GOR ≤1,000,000 scf/bbl) 4\\\\. Dry Gas (GOR > 1,000,000 scf/bbl) 5\\\\. Coal Bed Methane.  In two-stroke engines  As two-stroke engines use their crankcase to pressurize the air:fuel mixture before transfer to the cylinder, any standard lubricating oil left there (per practice with four-stroke engines) would be swept up and burnt with the fuel. To provide cylinder lubrication, fuels supplied to two-stroke engines are often mixed with oil so that it can coat the cylinders and bearing surfaces along its path. The ratio of gas to oil is set by the engine manufacturer but ranges from 30:1 to 50:1 per volume unit. Oil remaining in the mixture is burnt with the fuel and results in a familiar blue smoke and odor.

It is located in Chanakyapuri, New Delhi. CRIS was established by the India's Ministry of Railways in 1986. History In 1982, Indian Railways (IR) set up a central organisation to computerise freight operations. The Ministry of Railways saw the need in 1986 for a dedicated, autonomous organisation and established CRIS, an umbrella organisation for all information technology-related activities on Indian Railways. It was tasked with designing, developing and implementing the Freight Operations Information System (FOIS) and its communications infrastructure. CRIS began functioning in July 1986 as an autonomous organisation headed by an executive director (later renamed managing director). A unique feature of CRIS is the collaboration by IT literates from Indian Railways. Systems managed by CRIS have been recognised by Computerworld.2005 Computerworld Honors Case Study, accessed 8 January 2007PCQUEST (India) Best IT Implementation of the Year 2006, accessed 8 January 2007 CRIS received the Prime Minister Award for Excellence in Public Administration on 21 April 2008, and the IBM Beacon and Top Star Awards for e-working on 1 May of that year. CRIS held a symposium, \\"IT Can Happen in Government\\", in New Delhi on 1 July 2010 after a previous symposium on 6 July 2009. The symposium explored challenges faced by government agencies in meeting their IT needs and creating IT systems. A seminar on big data was held in July 2014, followed by a one on smart cities in July 2015 and on mobility and mobile apps in 2018. CRIS seminars are held annually, with the most-recent one (on Digital Transformation of Large Enterprises) on 1 July 2019. In December 2019, the Ministry of Railways was considering a proposal to disband the CRIS and merge its operations with RailTel Corporation of India Ltd. Work CRIS designs, develops, implements and maintains information systems for Indian Railways. It has also developed, implemented and maintained IT systems for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands ship-ticketing system. The number of projects handled by CRIS has increased from three in 2000 to more than 80 by 2018. Most of the softwares developed by CRIS are outsourced. COA (Control Office Application), which assists train controllers (despatchers) in planning and tracking the movement of trains across the network, shares its data with applications such as NTES (with which passengers can obtain a train's location and expected movement) and FOIS. Train punctuality reports are generated through ICMS (Integrated Coaching Management System), which also receives data from COA. Major IR projects * Computerisation of the Freight Operations Information System: The FOIS enables management and control of freight movement, optimised asset utilisation and the generation of invoices. Many of IR's larger freight customers pay through an electronic payment gateway interfaced with the FOIS. About 72 percent of the railway's freight revenue is paid electronically. * Passenger Reservation System (PRS): A nationwide online passenger reservation and ticketing system, developed and maintained by CRIS, was developed in C and Fortran on a Digital OpenVMS operating system using RTR (Reliable Transaction Router) as middleware. Also known as CONCERT (Country- wide Network of Computerised Enhanced Reservation and Ticketing), it interconnects the four regional computing systems (in New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai) into a national PRS grid. It allows a passenger anywhere to book train tickets from any station to any station. PRS handles reservations, changes, cancellations and refunds, reserving over 1.6 million seats and berths daily. Complex rules, validations and fare-computation techniques are interwoven in the application. * Next Generation e-ticketing (NGeT): The Internet-based E-ticketing reservation system, developed for IRCTC, that connects at the back-end to PRS. * Computerisation of Indian Railways' Unreserved Ticketing System. Unreserved ticketing is a major component of IR’s ticket volume, and an important source of revenue. UTS delivers fast unreserved ticketing from dedicated counters, replacing manual printed-card tickets with centralised, online sales. The architecture integrates with handheld terminals, smart cards, vending machines and UTS Mobile app & website utsonmobile.indianrail.gov.in. * National Train Enquiry System, for latest train running times and live train tracking * Web-enabled claims: Web-based software enables the public to file and track claims online. * Rail Budget Compilation System (RBCS): Developed for budgetary input from Indian Railways zones and production units, RBCS facilitates data capture, database construction, demand analysis and estimate pruning for the railway budget. * Case Monitoring System: the online peoples' representatives demands monitoring and redress system * I-Pas is a comprehensive payroll and accounting system which has been extended throughout Indian Railways. * Workshop Information SystEm (WISE): A MIS project for railway workshops in Kharagpur, Jagadhri, Ajmer, Kota, Charbagh, Liluah, Kanchrapara, Matunga, Lower Parel, Parel, Bhusawal, Secunderabad, Lallaguda and Jamalpur. WISE provides a report for workshop management using the Oracle DBMS, and is being upgraded to an ERP-based system. * Crew management: Crew Management System (CMS) software provides real-time railway crew information. Information includes location, status, train assignment, time off and continuing education. The software issues SMS alerts to management and supervisors. It can book crew for coaching, shunting and freight service. The software supports safety monitoring of the crew by inspectors, assessing crew knowledge with a quiz administered through kiosks in crew lobbies, and provides up-to- date safety circulars. * Control Office Application (COA): Enables rail- traffic controllers to manage trains in their section, and is operational in all division control offices. The COA interfaces with other applications (such as NTES) to provide train information to passengers and managers. * E-Procurement System: Provides a secure, fair and transparent method of materials procurement through a web-based interface. It enables suppliers to securely upload their tenders to a central server in encrypted form, which can be decrypted only by authorised railway officials after the tender opening. All timestamps are authenticated by the National Physical Laboratory. The system is operational on all zone railways, and units and has been extended to CORE, RDSO, RailTel and the Kolkata Metro. E-Auction, launched in March 2012, has been adopted by all zone railways and production units. A payment gateway was implemented in January 2012, and about 280 crore (2.8 billion) in online funds was transferred by February 2014. * Software for Locomotive Asset Management (SLAM): Manages all aspects of electric-locomotive maintenance * An ERP-based system was implemented at the Integral Coach Factory in Chennai in January 2012. * Automatic fare-collection and passenger-control systems for Metro Railway in Kolkata using RFID technology * The Track Management System (TMS) manages all aspects of track maintenance. * CEP is an umbrella project which includes all the projects related to civil engineering. * Integrated Material Management System (iMMS) manages all aspects of material procurement and stocking, including e-auctioning of scrap.

Description  Like all sighted Phacopina, Huntoniatonia has eyes with relatively large, individually set calcite lenses (so-called schizochroal eyes). The natural fracture lines coming from the back of the eye, cross the margin of the headshield (or cephalon) to the side (or proparian sutures in science jargon). From the front of the eye the sutures from both sides run along the edge of the central raised area (or glabella) into each other, and do not cross the margin of the cephalon, resulting in yoked free cheeks (or librigenae). Like in all Dalmanitidae, the articulated midsection of the body (or thorax) has 11 segments. The cephalon of Huntoniatonia has a broad, flat frontal margin, with an extension to the front, a bit like a dolphin. The frontal lobe of the moderately convex glabella is much wider and longer than the other three pairs of lobes, and the occipital ring, all of which are defined by distinct glabellar furrows, that except for the occipital furrow, do not cross the midline. The eyes are large half circles that originate from immediately posterior of the frontal lobe and end parallel to the front of the occipital ring. They contain close to 30 vertical rows of up to 8 lenses in each on a slightly convex surface with a clear socket at the base and narrow ridge along the top. Stout genal spines arch back at some distance from the tips of the pleural tips to the 7th thorax segment. The axis is about half as wide as each of the ribs (or pleurae) to its sides. The tailshield (or pygidium) has 12-13 rings. The axis, that extends into a rather narrow spine, has about 10 ribs that do not reach into the border. It has an entire margin.  Taxonomy  Huntoniatonia may have been transitional between Dalmanites from the Silurian, and Odontochile from the Devonian. The genus was renamed from Huntonia to Huntoniatonia in 2003 because the name was already occupied for an isopod genus, Huntonia (Philosciidae).

He worked for Walther Bothe at the Physics Institute of the University of Heidelberg and then at the Institute for Physics of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research. Through his association with Bothe, he became involved in the German nuclear energy project, also known as the Uranium Club; one of Fleischmann’s areas of interest was isotope separation techniques. In 1941 he was appointed associate professor of experimental physics at the newly established Reichsuniversität Straßburg, in France. Late in 1944, he was arrested under the American Operation Alsos and sent to the United States. After he returned to Germany 1946, he became Director of the State Physical Institute at the University of Hamburg and developed it as a center of nuclear research. In 1953, he took a position at the University of Erlangen and achieved emeritus status in 1969. He was a signatory of the Göttingen Manifesto in 1957. Education From 1922 to 1926, Fleischmann studied at the Friedrich- Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg and the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München. He received his doctorate in 1929 under Bernhard Gudden, director of the Physics Institute at Erlangen; the subject of his thesis was on the photoelectric effect in solid-state physics.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry of Fleischmann. Career In 1931, Fleischmann became a teaching assistant to Robert Pohl, director of the I. Physikalische Institut (First Physics Institute) at the Georg-August-Universität Göttingen. There he continued his work on solid-state physics. In 1932, Walther Bothe had succeeded Philipp Lenard as Director of the Physikalische und Radiologische Institut (Physical and Radiological Institute) at the University of Heidelberg. It was then that Fleischmann became a teaching assistant to Bothe. When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933, the concept of Deutsche Physik took on more favor as well as fervor; deutsche Physik, was anti-Semitic and anti-theoretical physics, especially modern physics, including quantum mechanics and both atomic and nuclear physics. As applied in the university environment, political factors took priority over the historically applied concept of scholarly ability,Beyerchen, 1997, 141-167. even though its two most prominent supporters were the Nobel Laureates in Physics Philipp Lenard Beyerchen, 1977, 79-102. and Johannes Stark.Beyerchen, 1977, 103-140. Supporters of deutsche Physik launched vicious attacks against leading theoretical physicists. While Lenard was retired from the University of Heidelberg, he still had significant influence there. In 1934, Lenard had managed to get Bothe relieved of his directorship of the Physical and Radiological Institute at the University of Heidelberg, whereupon Bothe was able to become the Director of the Institut für Physik of the KWImF, replacing Karl W. Hauser, who had recently died. Ludolf von Krehl, Director of the KWImF, and Max Planck, President of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society (KWG, Kaiser Wilhelm Society, today, the Max Planck Society), had offered the directorship to Bothe to ward off the possibility of his emigration. Fleischmann went with Bothe and worked with him there until 1941.Walther Bothe and the Physics Institute: the Early Years of Nuclear Physics, Nobelprize.org.Das Physikalische und Radiologische Institut der Universität Heidelberg, Heidelberger Neueste Nachrichten Volume 56 (7 March 1913).David M. States A History of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research: 1929-1939: Walther Bothe and the Physics Institute: The Early Years of Nuclear Physics, Nobelprize.org (28 June 2001).Landwehr, 2002. Bothe was a principal in the German nuclear energy project, also known as the Uranverein (Uranium Club), and Fleischmann was brought into the project through his affiliation with Bothe. Fleischmann worked on isotope separation techniques.Rudolf Fleischmann Ein mögliches Verfahren zure Isotopentrennung von Uran G-27 (3 July 1940). During the period in which deutsche Physik was gaining prominence, which started right after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, a foremost concern of many scientists in Germany was to maintain autonomy against political encroachment.Beyerchen, 1977, 199-210. Some of the more established scientists, such as Max von Laue, could demonstrate more autonomy than the younger and less established scientists.Hoffmann, 2005, 293-329. This was, in part, due to political organizations, such as the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund (NSDDB, National Socialist German University Lecturers League), whose district leaders had a decisive role in the acceptance of an Habilitationsschrift, which was a prerequisite to attaining the rank of Privatdozent necessary to becoming a university lecturer.Hentschel, 1996, Appendix C; see the entry for the NSDDB. While some with ability joined such organizations out of tactical career considerations, others with ability and adherence to historical academic standards joined these organizations to moderate their activities. This was the case of Wolfgang Finkelnburg.Beyerchen, 1977, 176-179.Hentschel, 1996, 341-342. It was in the summer of 1940 that Finkelnburg became an acting director of the NSDDB at Technische Hochschule Darmstadt.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, 290n2. As such, he organized the Münchner Religionsgespräche, which took place on 15 November 1940 and was known as the “Munich Synod.” The Münchner Religionsgespräche was an offensive against deutsche Physik.Finkelnburg, invited five representatives to make arguments for theoretical physics and academic decisions based on ability, rather than politics: Carl F. von Weizsäcker, Otto Scherzer, Georg Joos, Otto Heckmann, and Hans Kopfermann. Alfons Bühl, a supporter of deutsche Physik, invited Harald Volkmann, Bruno Thüring, Wilhelm Müller, Rudolf Tomaschek, and Ludwig Wesch. The discussion was led by Gustav Borer, with Herbert Stuart and Johannes Malsch as observers. See Document 110: The Fight against Party Politics by Wolfgang Finkelnburg in Hentschel, 1996, 339-345. Also see Beyerchen, 1977, 176-179. While the technical outcome may have been thin, it was a political victory against deutsche Physik. After this, the pendulum began to swing back to standards of achievement being used as a basis for making academic appointments, rather than political considerations. This was the case at the newly established German university in Strasbourg, France. After the Franco-German Armistice in 1940, the Reichsuniversität Straßburg (Reich’s University of Strassburg) in Strasbourg was founded in 1941. The newly founded research institute of the medical school at the Reichsuniversität Straßburg was modeled after the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für medizinische Forschung (KWImF, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research; today, the Max-Planck Institut für medizinische Forschung), in Heidelberg; it included institutes for internal medicine, physics, and chemistry. In the physics institute, there were to be two extraordinarius professors in experimental physics and one extraordinarius professor in theoretical physics; Fleischmann and Finkelnburg received the appointments in experimental physics and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker received the appointment in theoretical physics. They held these positions until late in 1944, when the Allied military forces liberated Strasbourg from German occupation.Walker, 1993, 41-44 and 66-73.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Fleischmann.Burghard Weiss Der Kernphysiker Rudolf Fleischmann und die Medizin an der Reichsuniversität Straßburg (1941–1944), NTM Zeitschrift für Geschichte der Wissenschaften, Technik und Medizin Volume 14, Number 2, 107-118 (2006). By the time the American Operation Alsos forces had entered Strasboug in late November 1944, von Weizsäcker had already escaped back to Germany. Fleischmann was arrested by the Alsos forces and incarcerated in a local jail until Samuel Goudsmit, chief scientific advisor to Operation Alsos, arrived and made other arrangements for his incarceration. Fleischmann was sent to the United States for interrogation on the Uranverein and to exploit his scientific expertise in nuclear and atomic physics.Walker, 1993, 154-156.Goudsmit, 1986, 66-67 and 70-73.Powers, 1993, 367-368.Pash, 1969, 148-149 and 153.R. Flieschemann [in Strassburg] Über den zweckmäßigsten Bau von Trennrohranlagen für kontinuierlichen Betrieb G-350 (ca. 1942). After Fleischmann’s return to Germany in 1946, he accepted the appointment to the Lehrstuhl für Experimentalphysik (Chair for Experimental Physics) at the University of Hamburg and he became Director of the Physikalische Staatsinstitut (State Physical Institute) and ordinarius professor (ordentlicher Professor) for experimental physics. Initially, due to restrictions by the Allied occupying powers in Germany, nuclear research was forbidden. During this time, Fleischmann developed a new method for determining the optical constants of thin metal layers. As the Cold War developed, this restriction was eased and Fleischmann was able to make the University of Hamburg a center for nuclear physics research. This was done with the able assistance of colleagues such as Erich Bagge, H. Neuert, and Rodolf Kollath.Herwig Schopper A life in science, CERN Courier (1 June 2003).Geschichte des Fachbereichs - Universität Hamburg. In 1953, Fleischmann became an ordinarius professor at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. He achieved emeritus status in 1969. In 1957, Fleischmann was a signatory of the manifesto of the Göttinger Achtzehn (Göttingen Eighteen). The 18 eminent scientists were opposed to arming the West German military with tactical nuclear weapons.Declaration of the German Nuclear Physicists ArmsControl.de . Personal Fleischmann was an accomplished musician and he played both the violin and the piano. Internal Reports The following reports were published in Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte (Research Reports in Nuclear Physics), an internal publication of the German Uranverein. The reports were classified Top Secret, they had very limited distribution, and the authors were not allowed to keep copies. The reports were confiscated under the Allied Operation Alsos and sent to the United States Atomic Energy Commission for evaluation. In 1971, the reports were declassified and returned to Germany. The reports are available at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center and the American Institute of Physics.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix E; see the entry for Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte.Walker, 1993, 268-274. *Rudolf Fleischmann Ein mögliches Verfahren zure Isotopentrennung von Uran G-27 (3 July 1940) *G-343.

It was closed in 1960 by British Railways. History The station started life as part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Pendleton and Hindley line that grew into (and still exists today as) the Manchester Victoria to Wigan Wallgate line. Heading from Manchester towards Wigan, the preceding station was at Irlams o' th' Height (closed in 1956), and the following station was at Swinton (still open). Pendlebury station was closed in 1960. The existing lines still widen where the island platform existed (removed in 1978). By 1922, ownership had passed from the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, and upon nationalisation in 1949 it became property of British Railways. A 1905 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing (upper right) railways in the vicinity of Pendlebury It was located on Bolton Road (A666), opposite St. Augustine's Church and the former (appropriately named) Station Hotel pub which is nowadays the Trattoria Italian restaurant. The railway station was about 760 yards east of the present-day Swinton railway station. The station was located just before the entrance to a tunnel underneath Bolton Road. From the site of the station the tunnel goes as far as Swinton Hall Road where it comes out and into a cutting on its way towards Swinton. A 1909 Ordnance Survey map shows no buildings on top of the tunnel's location, suggesting that it was not stable to be built upon at this time. In the Black Harry Tunnel collapse of 1953, part of the tunnel collapsed. Two houses fell into the resultant large void in Temple Drive, Swinton. Five people in the houses were killed. http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/eventsummary.php?eventID=475 . The Swinton and Pendlebury Journal of 7 October 1960 reported that the last train to call at Pendlebury railway station was the 23:21 from Manchester Victoria to Wigan on the previous Saturday (1 October 1960) - there were 6 people aboard one of whom was a 37-year-old shopkeeper Mr Jackson, proprietor of 419 Chorley Road, Swinton. Mr Jackson reportedly bought the last ticket ever issued at Pendlebury station from the porter Mr D. White - a single to Swinton. Mr Jackson also reportedly travelled to Irlams o' th' Height on 3 March 1956 to purchase the last ever ticket issued there. A pub, the Station Hotel, was located on the opposite side of the road. The building still exists but has been refurbished into the Trattoria Italian restaurant. Some of the yellow brickwork of the station is still visible on Bolton Road. Station layout The layout was four tracks wide, with an island platform serving two of the tracks being connected to Bolton Road via a footbridge. Several sets of points lay at the eastern end of the station. The Clifton Hall Tunnel (sometimes called the Black Harry Tunnel), part of the London and North Western Railway's Clifton Branch, ran underneath the eastern end of the station. The is a sign at the eastern end of the old platforms indicating to railway workers where the line of the old tunnel is.  Popular culture The artist L.S. Lowry lived at 117 Station Road (B5231), Pendlebury; a number of documentary films from the late 1950s (one from the BBC) show him using the station, which was about a mile from his home. Swinton was closer to his home, and it is from Swinton that he used to view the Acme Mill, which featured in two of his iconic paintings: Coming home from the Mill (1930) The Mill, Pendlebury (1941).

Although theoretically applicable to any form of contract, most of the jurisprudence relating to Himalaya clauses relate to maritime matters, and exclusion clauses in bills of lading for the benefit of employees, crew, and agents, stevedores in particular. The Himalaya case The clause takes its name from a decision of the English Court of Appeal in the case of Adler v Dickson (The Himalaya) [1954].Adler v Dickson [1954] 2 LLR 267, [1955] 1 QB 158 The claimant, Mrs Adler, was a passenger on a voyage on the . At the port of Trieste, she was injured when a gangway came adrift, throwing her onto the quayside, 18 feet below. The passenger ticket contained non-responsibility clauses exempting the carrier, as follows: :\\"Passengers and their baggage are carried at the passenger's entire risk\\", and :\\"The company will not be responsible for and shall be exempt from all liability respect of any ... damage or injury whatsoever of or to the person of any passenger...\\"Adler v Dickson [1954] 2 LLR at page 269Note: The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 s 2 makes void any contractual term seeking to limit or exempt liability for death or personal injury caused by one's negligence. Being unable to sue the steamship company in contract, Mrs Adler instead sued the master of the ship and the bosun in negligence. The defendants sought to rely on the protection of the exclusion clauses on the passenger's ticket; but Mrs Adler argued that under the doctrine of privity of contract, the defendants could not rely on the terms of a contract to which they were not party. The Court of Appeal declared that in the carriage of passengers (as well as in the carriage of goods) the law does permit a carrier to stipulate not only for himself, but also for those whom he engaged to carry out the contract,Adler v Dickson [1954] 2 LLR ; Denning LJ at page 270 adding that the stipulation might be express or implied. On the particular facts, the court held that the defendants could not take advantage of the exception clause as the passenger ticket passed no benefit to servants or agents, neither expressly nor by implication.Adler v Dickson [1954] 2 LLR ; Denning LJ at page 272 As a consequence of this decision, specially drafted Himalaya clauses benefiting stevedores and others began to be included in bills of lading. As the negligent master and bosun were employees acting in the course and scope of their employment, their employer would have been vicariously liable. Although the case does not specifically discuss vicarious liability, Denning LJ stated, at page 270 \\"...the steamship company say that, as good employers, they will stand behind the master and boatswain and meet any damages and costs that may be awarded against them\\". Although the decision in The Himalaya is clear and unambiguous, the reasoning underpinning the case is still the subject of some debate. The courts at various times have suggested that the exception to the common law rules of privity of contract may be founded upon \\"public policy\\" reasoning, the law of agency, trust arrangements or (with respect to goods) by the law of bailment rather than the law of contracts.  Legal developments since Adler v Dickson The decision is now accepted as settled law in most common law countries, having been upheld several times by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The Himalaya decision itself has been partly superseded by legislation in the United Kingdom on two fronts: * Under s.2(1) of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, it is no longer possible to limit liability for personal injury or death caused by negligence; * Under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, section 6, contracts may confer benefits upon third parties, in a wider form than under the decision in the Himalaya. * Although the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 does NOT apply to contracts for carriage of goods by sea (in order to avoid conflict with the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971), the 1999 Act does permit the giving to a third party the benefit of an exclusion or limitation clause in the contract. The following cases reveal how English common law has progressed since Adler v Dickson: * Scruttons v Midland Silicones [1962] AC 446: The House of Lords applied the Privity Rule to prevent a negligent stevedore from relying on a limitation clause in the bill of lading.http://www.nadr.co.uk/articles/published/CommercialLawReports/Scruttons%20v%20Midland%20Silicones%201961.pdf * N.Z. Shipping v Satterthwaite (The Eurymedon) [1975] AC 154: The Privy Council found that enough had been done to allow a negligent stevedore to rely on such a limitation clause.http://www.nadr.co.uk/articles/published/CommercialLawReports/Eurymedon%201974.pdf * Port Jackson Stevedoring v Salmond, The New York Star [1980] 3 All ER 257 PC developed the law further.http://netk.net.au/Contract/Port.asp * The Mahkutai [1996] AC 650, 664–5, where Lord Goff opined that it was \\"perhaps inevitable\\" that there should develop \\"a fully-fledged exception to the doctrine of privity of contract\\". * Houtimport v Agrosin, The Starsin [2003] 1 Lloyd's Rep 571 also developed the law further.http://www.nadr.co.uk/articles/published/ArbLR/Starsin%202001.pdfhttp://www.simsl.com/Publications/Articles/Articles/01_BoL_OwnChart_4.asp  The United States  The decision of the English courts has been generally accepted and adopted throughout the Commonwealth. In the United States, which has always had a more circumspect view of the rules of privity of contract, has generally been accommodating to exceptions to the principle, and the decision in Herd v Krawill 359 US 297 [1959], Lloyd’s Rep 305, is generally taken to uphold them provided (as in other legal systems) certain criteria are ahered to.

Environmental threats During the development of Interstate 40 through Memphis in the 1960s, 26 acres of the Old Forest were slated to be destroyed to make way for the new highway, which would have also severed the Memphis Zoo from the rest of Overton Park. A grassroots organization, the Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, rallied to protect the forest. In Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe the U.S. Supreme Court finally saved the Old Forest from highway construction plans in 1971. In 1987, the Tennessee Department of Transportation deeded the 26-acre corridor back to the City of Memphis. In 2008, the Memphis Zoo clear-cut to make way for a new exhibit, Teton Trek. The destruction sparked the revival of CPOP to prevent further expansion of the zoo into the Old Forest.

It was the former junior school (after St. George's School in Ascot, Berkshire), of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (then known as Brunswick School and located in Hove, near Brighton). The last headmaster was Richard Taylor. who took over from Mark Ellerton in 2005. Before closing, the school had 138 pupils. Stoke Brunswick School closed in the summer of 2009 because the forecast pupil intake for September was \\"not adequate\\". Despite their best efforts to secure the school's future, including a six figure financial pledge, the parents fell just short of numbers for it to continue. History 160px The oldest wing of the building, in which the Headmaster resided, dates back to the 14th century and was a hunting lodge belonging to John of Gaunt. The rest of building, built in the 17th century, was originally situated in Cheshire and was called Dutton Hall. It was transported piece by piece to its current location, Homestall, in the 1930s by the Dewar family. During World War II, it was used by the Red Cross to house military casualties, including burned aircrew (members of the Guinea Pig Club) recovering from surgeries performed by Archibald McIndoe and his plastic surgery team at nearby Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead.see: Richard Hillary, \\"The Last Enemy\\", 2019, Spitfire Publishers LTD.

It became an all-boys school after WWII. The school became co- educational in 1964. Grounds The school was situated in the idyllic setting of the Sussex countryside. There were of grounds for the children to play in. of these 30 were mainly woodland, in which the children would play at breaktimes in summer. Facilities The school had 28 classrooms. There was a chemistry lab, a library, a newly refurbished gymnasium, a chapel, a swimming pool, 8 playing fields, a 9-hole golf course, extensive dyslexia facilities, a pre-prep school and a network of computers for teachers and pupils alike to use. Music The school had a reputation as one of the most musical in the area. The last head of music was Caroline Long, who took over from Sue Barber in 2006. She taught the pupils using the Kodály method. The school choir often reached the semi-finals of Children's Choir of the Year, and participated in Glyndebourne operatic productions numerous times. All of the pupils were encouraged to learn a musical instrument and sing. The successful drum group performed at numerous prestigious locations, and reached the finals of the Music for Youth competition at the Royal Festival Hall for the last two consecutive years. The Stoke Brunswick choir was well known by many in the area. Sport Stoke Brunswick offered a wide range of sports and encouraged participation whatever the individual's abilities.

Hence high content screening is a type of phenotypic screen conducted in cells involving the analysis of whole cells or components of cells with simultaneous readout of several parameters. HCS is related to high-throughput screening (HTS), in which thousands of compounds are tested in parallel for their activity in one or more biological assays, but involves assays of more complex cellular phenotypes as outputs. Phenotypic changes may include increases or decreases in the production of cellular products such as proteins and/or changes in the morphology (visual appearance) of the cell. Hence HCA typically involves automated microscopy and image analysis. Unlike high-content analysis, high-content screening implies a level of throughput which is why the term \\"screening\\" differentiates HCS from HCA, which may be high in content but low in throughput. In high content screening, cells are first incubated with the substance and after a period of time, structures and molecular components of the cells are analyzed. The most common analysis involves labeling proteins with fluorescent tags, and finally changes in cell phenotype are measured using automated image analysis. Through the use of fluorescent tags with different absorption and emission maxima, it is possible to measure several different cell components in parallel. Furthermore, the imaging is able to detect changes at a subcellular level (e.g., cytoplasm vs. nucleus vs. other organelles). Therefore a large number of data points can be collected per cell. In addition to fluorescent labeling, various label free assays have been used in high content screening.  General principles  One of the applications of HCS is the discovery of new drug candidates High-content screening (HCS) in cell-based systems uses living cells as tools in biological research to elucidate the workings of normal and diseased cells. HCS is also used to discover and optimize new drug candidates. High content screening is a combination of modern cell biology, with all its molecular tools, with automated high resolution microscopy and robotic handling. Cells are first exposed to chemicals or RNAi reagents. Changes in cell morphology are then detected using image analysis. Changes in the amounts of proteins synthesized by cells are measured using a variety of techniques such as the green fluorescent proteins fused to endogenous proteins, or by fluorescent antibodies. The technology may be used to determine whether a potential drug is disease modifying. For example, in humans G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large family of around 880 cell surface proteins that transduce extra-cellular changes in the environment into a cell response, like triggering an increase in blood pressure because of the release of a regulatory hormone into the blood stream. Activation of these GPCRs can involve their entry into cells and when this can be visualised it can be the basis of a systematic analysis of receptor function through chemical genetics, systematic genome wide screening or physiological manipulation. At a cellular level, parallel acquisition of data on different cell properties, for example activity of signal transduction cascades and cytoskeleton integrity is the main advantage of this method in comparison to the faster but less detailed high throughput screening. While HCS is slower, the wealth of acquired data allows a more profound understanding of drug effects. Automated image based screening permits the identification of small compounds altering cellular phenotypes and is of interest for the discovery of new pharmaceuticals and new cell biological tools for modifying cell function. The selection of molecules based on a cellular phenotype does not require a prior knowledge of the biochemical targets that are affected by compounds. However the identification of the biological target will make subsequent preclinical optimization and clinical development of the compound hit significantly easier. Given the increase in the use of phenotypic/visual screening as a cell biological tool, methods are required that permit systematic biochemical target identification if these molecules are to be of broad use. Target identification has been defined as the rate limiting step in chemical genetics/high-content screening.  Instrumentation  An automated confocal image reader High-content screening technology is mainly based on automated digital microscopy and flow cytometry, in combination with IT-systems for the analysis and storage of the data. “High-content” or visual biology technology has two purposes, first to acquire spatially or temporally resolved information on an event and second to automatically quantify it. Spatially resolved instruments are typically automated microscopes, and temporal resolution still requires some form of fluorescence measurement in most cases. This means that a lot of HCS instruments are (fluorescence) microscopes that are connected to some form of image analysis package. These take care of all the steps in taking fluorescent images of cells and provide rapid, automated and unbiased assessment of experiments. HCS instruments on the market today can be separated based on an array of specifications that significantly influence the instruments versatility and overall cost. These include speed, a live cell chamber that includes temperature and CO2 control (some also have humidity control for longer term live cell imaging), a built in pipettor or injector for fast kinetic assays, and additional imaging modes such as confocal, bright field, phase contrast and FRET. One of the most incisive difference is whether the instruments are optical confocal or not. Confocal microscopy summarizes as imaging/resolving a thin slice through an object and rejecting out of focus light that comes from outside this slice. Confocal imaging enables higher image signal to noise and higher resolution than the more commonly applied epi-fluorescence microscopy. Depending on the instrument confocality is achieved via laser scanning, a single spinning disk with pinholes or slits, a dual spinning disk, or a virtual slit. There are trade offs of sensitivity, resolution, speed, photo-toxicity, photo-bleaching, instrument complexity, and price between these various confocal techniques. What all instruments share is the ability to take, store and interpret images automatically and integrate into large robotic cell/medium handling platforms. Software Many screens are analyzed using the image analysis software that accompanies the instrument, providing a turn-key solution. Third-party software alternatives are often used for particularly challenging screens or where a laboratory or facility has multiple instruments and wishes to standardize to a single analysis platform. Some instrument software provides bulk importing and exporting of images and data, for users who want to do such standardization on a single analysis platform without the use of third-party software, however.  Applications  This technology allows a (very) large number of experiments to be performed, allowing explorative screening. Cell-based systems are mainly used in chemical genetics where large, diverse small molecule collections are systematically tested for their effect on cellular model systems. Novel drugs can be found using screens of tens of thousands of molecules, and these have promise for the future of drug development. Beyond drug discovery, chemical genetics is aimed at functionalizing the genome by identifying small molecules that acts on most of the 21,000 gene products in a cell. High-content technology will be part of this effort which could provide useful tools for learning where and when proteins act by knocking them out chemically. This would be most useful for gene where knock out mice (missing one or several genes) can not be made because the protein is required for development, growth or otherwise lethal when it is not there. Chemical knock out could address how and where these genes work. Further the technology is used in combination with RNAi to identify sets of genes involved in specific mechanisms, for example cell division. Here, libraries of RNAis, covering a whole set of predicted genes inside the target organism's genome can be used to identify relevant subsets, facilitating the annotation of genes for which no clear role has been established beforehand. The large datasets produced by automated cell biology contain spatially resolved, quantitative data which can be used for building for systems level models and simulations of how cells and organisms function. Systems biology models of cell function would permit prediction of why, where and how the cell responds to external changes, growth and disease.  History  High-content screening technology allows for the evaluation of multiple biochemical and morphological parameters in intact biological systems. For cell-based approaches the utility of automated cell biology requires an examination of how automation and objective measurement can improve the experimentation and the understanding of disease. First, it removes the influence of the investigator in most, but not all, aspects of cell biology research and second it makes entirely new approaches possible. In review, classical 20th century cell biology used cell lines grown in culture where the experiments were measured using very similar to that described here, but there the investigator made the choice on what was measured and how. In the early 1990s, the development of CCD cameras (charge coupled device cameras) for research created the opportunity to measure features in pictures of cells- such as how much protein is in the nucleus, how much is outside. Sophisticated measurements soon followed using new fluorescent molecules, which are used to measure cell properties like second messenger concentrations or the pH of internal cell compartments. The wide use of the green fluorescent protein, a natural fluorescent protein molecule from jellyfish, then accelerated the trend toward cell imaging as a mainstream technology in cell biology. Despite these advances, the choice of which cell to image and which data to present and how to analyze it was still selected by the investigator. By analogy, if one imagines a football field and dinner plates laid across it, instead of looking at all of them, the investigator would choose a handful near the score line and had to leave the rest. In this analogy the field is a tissue culture dish, the plates the cells growing on it. While this was a reasonable and pragmatic approach automation of the whole process and the analysis makes possible the analysis of the whole population of living cells, so the whole football field can be measured.

He was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1800, the son of a prominent engineer, and graduated from Trinity College. He served with the Board of Works as consulting engineer. In 1834, with his wife, Killaly came to New York state, later settling in London township in Upper Canada. In 1837, he was involved in a re-survey of the Welland Canal and, in 1838, was appointed engineer for the Welland Canal Company. In 1840, he was appointed chairman of the Board of Works for Lower Canada. In 1841, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for London; in March of that year, he was named to the Executive Council. Later that same year, he was named chairman of the Board of Works for the United Province. Although highly competent as an engineer, Killaly had little patience for cost estimates or financial reporting. In 1843, he resigned from the Executive Council as part of the mass resignation to protest Governor General Metcalfe's failure to consult them on political appointments. Some concerns had been voiced regarding decisions made by the Board of Works and, in 1846, it was replaced by the Department of Public Works headed by William Benjamin Robinson. In 1848, Killaly was named superintendent for the Welland Canal. He was named assistant commissioner of public works in 1851 and served until 1859, when this position was abolished and he became inspector of railways. In 1862, he was part of a royal commission that reported on the state of fortifications and defence in the Canadian colonies. Shortly after that, he retired to Picton, where he lived quietly until his death in 1874. Killaly was described by William Agar Adamson, chaplain to Governor General Lord Sydenham, as \\"the most expensively and ill-dressed man on the wide continent of North America\\".

The construction of the runway was finished in 2015 and the airport opened in 2016. The inaugural scheduled flight was delayed but general aviation, charter, and medical evacuation flights were able to serve the airport from May 2016. The airport began scheduled commercial services on 14 October 2017, when the South African carrier Airlink inaugurated a weekly service from O. R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg, South Africa, via Walvis Bay Airport, Namibia, using an Embraer E190-100IGW, about one and a half years after the originally expected inauguration date, and with a smaller-sized aircraft, because of wind shear problems affecting the airport.AIRPORT OPENING CEREMONY POSTPONED (St Helena Government 26 April 2016)bbc.com – St Helena airport delay 'to increase cost to UK government' 9 May 2016 Additionally, monthly charter flights operate between Ascension Island and Saint Helena. History Background Saint Helena is more than from the nearest major landmass. Prior to the opening of the airport, the island was only reachable by sea, making it one of the most remote populated places on earth, measured as travel time from major cities. Sea journeys used to take five days from Cape Town, with departures once every three weeks. The first consideration of an airport on St Helena was made in 1943 by the South African Air Force, which undertook a survey on Prosperous Bay Plain from October 1943 until January 1944, but concluded that, while technically feasible, an airport was not a practical proposition. From the 1960s, there was an idea to build an airport on the Island. In 1999, this was taken up by the island government. It was suggested that an airport would extend the United Kingdom's capabilities to carry out airborne missions in the South Atlantic region, such as maritime patrols in accordance with international fishing agreements (e.g., International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas), counter-piracy missions along important trade routes, and also airlift operations notably into Southern Africa. According to analysts, the UK government's decision to finally go ahead with the airport, after long delays, seems to be driven in part by concerns over a continuing tense standoff with Argentina in the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute. The island is about from the Falklands – seven hours and 40 minutes' flight time. But, analysts say that was nevertheless an improvement over the present state of isolation from the UK for both St Helena and the Falklands. The following possible benefits were also factors in the decision-making process: * Air access would allow St Helena to develop its tourism sector. * The new wharf in Rupert's Bay could allow regularly passing cruise ships to land passengers at the island and bring tourists if sized appropriately. The lack of a protected landing facility represents a limitation on the development of cruise tourism. In unfavourable sea conditions, landing is hazardous and potential revenue is lost as many cruise ships refuse to allow passengers to land in such circumstances. In addition, because there is no protected landing facility, many cruise companies do not incorporate St Helena into their itineraries. The sea is roughest in summer which marks the peak of the cruise season.\\"Jamestown, St Helena Wharf Improvements, Project EIA: Phase 2, Final Report\\" by the Government of St Helena, 8 August 2011 * Medical evacuations to South Africa for treatment of serious cases of illness would be sped up significantly: it may take up to one month until transport to South Africa by RMS St Helena becomes available. * The availability of heavy construction equipment would facilitate alternative energy projects, such as the construction of larger wind turbines, a tidal power plant or a dam with a hydro-power station in one of St Helena's valleys.St Helena Airport Environmental Statement – Volume 2 by Faber Maunsell AECOM, p. 17-3 Limitations in cargo size of RMS St Helena and the unavailability of a large crane prohibit construction of larger wind turbines. View over Prosperous Bay Plain in the 1980s. In contrast to the projected benefits, there were concerns that the proposed construction on the Prosperous Bay Plain would be detrimental to the local environment. Specifically, Prosperous Bay Plain was one of the few remaining sites on Saint Helena that held significant ecological diversity. According to a 2004 review by Atkins Management Consultants, the survival of numerous endemic species critically depended on preservation and protection of the location. It was also an important nesting site for the wirebird, Saint Helena's national bird which is listed as vulnerable. Although the St Helena Leisure Corporation (Shelco) was a major force pushing for the airport's construction, its co-founder Sir Nigel Thompson was a former chairman of the environmental charity Campaign to Protect Rural England.Robin Stummer and Daniel Howden: \\"The Battle for St Helena\\" .

Bidding process  After a long period of rumour and consultation, in March 2005 the British government announced plans to construct an airport in St Helena, expected to be completed by 2010 and funded by the Department for International Development (DfID). According to Private Eye magazine, all of the companies tendering for the job of building and running the airport had by late September 2006 withdrawn from bidding for the project. The local Access Office explained that it seemed the bidders considered the DfID was unhelpful by not providing the possibility of on-site investigations in order to complete a detailed design before providing a fixed price for the project. According to the DfID's Director for Overseas Territories, his department remained committed to an airport for St Helena.\\"Departure Delayed\\". Private Eye, No. 1167, 15–28 September 2006. DfID restarted the procurement process to identify a suitable Design, Build and Operate (DBO) contractor in October 2006. Capability Statements were received by DfID in March 2007 and four bidders were pre-approved for the DBO contract and a further three applicants have been pre-approved for the Air Service Provider contract. The applicants for the DBO visited the island for six months from June 2007 before submitting their final proposals, and by January 2008 DfID was down to a shortlist of two bidders. There were delays by the British government, which went up to Prime Minister Gordon Brown who insisted on personally reviewing the paperwork. An approved bidder was appointed in 2008, the Italian company Impregilo. The project was suspended in November 2008, because of financial pressures brought on by the financial crisis of 2007–2010.

The UK government also granted additional funds of up to £10 million in shared-risk contingency, and £35.1 million for 10 years of operation by South African airport operator Lanseria Airport. The airport would be the largest single investment ever made in the island. Design work started immediately after the contract award.\\"Airport News\\" St Helena Independent, Volume VI, Issue 49, 21 October 2011, p. 2 Following the second visit by a Basil Read team (during December 2011) the project manager settled on the island and the first St Helenian citizen was employed. Preparation works began in early 2012 in Rupert's Valley on the west coast, which included establishing storage facilities, a temporary fuel farm and the design and construction of a temporary wharf.\\"Second Basil Read Team Arrives\\" The St Helena Herald, Volume XI Number 33, 9 December 2011, p.4 A new jetty was built at Rupert's Bay to enable the landing of supplies and construction vehicles. Construction of the airport terminal and air traffic control tower. Logistics of the airport's construction were critical, because of the island's isolated location and the lack of construction equipment, which would require everything such as extremely heavy duty equipment and materials to be shipped in, thus resulting in a huge and unique logistics operation.\\"Basil Read's second team Visits and first St Helenian employed\\", St Helena Herald, Volume XI no. 35, 23 December 2011, p. 5 Due to the limited landing infrastructure, with no breakwater or mooring facilities at the sea front, new harbour facilities capable of handling construction equipment and fuel supplies were constructed at Rupert's Bay.\\"St Helena Access Feasibility Study\\" St Helena Government, Department for International Development, January 2005, p. 17 Fuel transfers between Rupert's Bay and the aerodrome, connected by a haul road, were assumed to be by road tanker for 20 years, after which a capital allowance was made for enlargement of the bulk fuel storage and the installation of a fuel transfer pipeline. Basil Read sourced its own ship, a roll-on/roll-off vessel\\"Basil Read wins R2.7bn contract to build St Helena's first airport \\" Engineering News, 3 November 2011 called NP Glory 4 flying the Thai flag, which docked for the first time at St Helena on 11 July 2012 and subsequently provided regular supplies to the island, including cargo and personnel for the project. On 17 July 2012, the St Helena Government and Basil Read agreed to a change to the runway design, which including widening the embankment over an additional at the southern end, paving an additional of the runway with concrete, providing larger turning circles at the runway ends, and increasing the size of the apron. In contrast to the 2011 reference design for the airport it would now have a full runway end safety area (RESA) at the southern end of the runway instead of the planned engineered materials arresting system (EMAS). The intention was to add an EMAS designed for Boeing 737-800 later butting onto the southern end of the paved runway to increase the declarable landing distance available (LDA) to , to allow the operation of larger aircraft such as the Boeing 737-800 and Airbus A320. In June 2013 the 100,000th truckload of fill went into Dry Gut, a gorge which had to be raised by almost in order to create an embankment that would finally carry parts of the runway. This was equivalent to nearly 19% of the total of 8 million cubic metres required. Basil Read's calculations showed that a further 430,000 truckloads of material would be needed to complete the fill. In October 2013 the St Helena government and Basil Read formally agreed to expand the runway shoulders, taxiway and apron to accommodate ICAO Code D aircraft, and to increase the fire fighting capacity (ICAO rescue fire fighting service category 7). These enhancements make it possible for the Lockheed C-130 Hercules and the Boeing 757 to operate to and from St Helena, though the runway is unlikely to be long enough to accommodate larger Code D aircraft, such as the Boeing 767. The upgrade was to be funded from cost savings on other parts of the project, particularly by a simplified runway drainage system. In September 2013, workers employed by Basil Read went on strike in a dispute over working conditions and wages – it was the island's first strike in half a century. By summer 2015, the Dry Gut fill project was completed and the new runway built. Construction of the airport was completed on schedule. Airport certification and opening Avia Solutions Group was appointed to support the St Helena Government (SHG) and the UK Department for International Development (DFID) in reaching a contract with an air service provider to provide services to the island. Calibration flights at the airport began in mid-September 2015. A Beechcraft King Air 200, leased from TAB Charters in South Africa, landed on 15 September 2015 in order to perform tests of the airport navigation systems. UK-based Flight Calibration Services undertook the flights and flew from Lanseria International Airport, in Johannesburg, flying via Namibia and Angola. The aircraft was on site for approximately one week to undertake the calibration flights. Opening was originally scheduled for February 2016 but that was postponed a number of times because of air traffic control related issues. In November 2015, a delay of the opening from February to May 2016 was announced. This was needed \\"in order to fine tune the operational readiness of the airport\\". Due to uncertainties concerning weather conditions and, in particular the amount of turbulence on the approaches from fallwinds resulting from the elevated location and the surrounding bluffs, it was recommended that a charter aircraft should perform approaches to and departures from the intended runway.\\"St Helena Access Feasibility Study\\" St Helena Government, Department for International Development, January 2005, p. 117 By April 2016 such flights had taken place, and they were not positive, causing a delay in traffic start. The Boeing 737-800 implementation flight landing at the airport. The first large (above 100 seats) passenger jet landed on 18 April 2016, a Boeing 737-800 operated by Comair. It was an implementation flight to test the route, ground operations and handling, ahead of commencement of scheduled services. The landing was not straightforward, with the aircraft only successfully landing on its third approach (the first approach was a planned Go-around, because of the lack of experience with this airport). On 26 April 2016, a further delay to the opening, without a specified end date, was announced by the St. Helena Government because of concerns regarding wind shear, after the problematic landing by the Comair 737-800 intended for regular flights. Only southbound landings (runway 20) have wind shear problems, not northbound. There is a need to define measurement methods for the wind shear in order to understand when landing can be done, and when to cancel flights. The late postponement caused extra cost, for example contracted employees and contracted airlines that cannot operate, hotels that were built, and also the need to extend the use of the RMS St Helena, which originally was due to be retired after the airport opened. Following an inspection in April 2016, on 10 May, UK-based Air Safety Support International (ASSI), a subsidiary company of the Civil Aviation Authority responsible for aviation safety in Overseas Territories, issued an Aerodrome Certificate to St Helena Airport. This safety certificate indicated that airport infrastructure, aviation security measures and air traffic control service complied with international aviation safety and security standards. ASSI did not allow the airport to go into commercial operation, however, due to concerns over operational readiness of monitoring and clearing issues that include wind shear and turbulence.St Helena Airport step closer to operating as final RMS journey on the horizon , Traveller24, 12 May 2016 The airport opened in June 2016, but restrictions for large aircraft remained due to dangerous wind shear. The airport's advocates hope that it will bring growth to the island's economy through tourism, leading to financial self-sustainability and an end to UK budgetary aid. A new safety certificate was delivered on 26 October 2016 by Air Safety Support International. After the bankruptcy of the company Basil Read which built and operated the airport, the Saint Helena government owned company took over the operations, for which it got a new safety certificate on 5 October 2018. Early air traffic history Since the airport opened, , 32 private aircraft have landed at the airport. These flights were mostly for either business passengers or medical evacuation purposes. The aircraft involved were smaller and lighter than the Boeing 737 and usually landed in the opposite direction on the runway from that taken by the 737-800 implementation flight in the southbound direction. The opposite, northbound, direction has an approach which is generally less turbulent but can only be used by lighter aircraft. The first helicopter to use the airport was an AgustaWestland Wildcat HMA.2 of 201 Flight 825 Naval Air Squadron attached to the Type 23 frigate on 14 October 2015. An important reason to build the airport was availability for medical emergency evacuation. On 3 June 2016 the first ambulance flight took place, for a baby and his mother. There are no aircraft dedicated to calibration flights, but occasionally such flights have taken place. On Friday 21 October 2016, an Avro RJ100 jet airliner sponsored by Atlantic Star Airlines landed on St Helena Airport, with 13 non-commercial passengers on board, as part of a delivery to Chile. Both pilots were from the Faroe Islands and had experience from there with landing in windy conditions.Is Atlantic Star The Solution To St Helena Airport Wind Shear?' 22 October 2016. An Embraer ERJ-190-100 operated by Embraer Aviation flew from Brazil and made a number of landings and starts on St Helena on 30 November and 1 December 2016. On 18 December 2016 a Royal Air Force C-130J Hercules landed at St Helena, the first fixed-wing military aircraft to land on the island. A South African Air Force C-130 visited the airport twice in July 2017. Establishing commercial air service Saint Helena Airport viewed from the Millenium ForestPrior to the opening of the airport, it was decided that St Helena would have an open skies policy; this allows any airline operator who meets all the required standards to fly in and out of St Helena. Projections for commercial flight costs were also drawn up and the St Helena Government expected that a return economy flight from St Helena to South Africa would cost around £600. Assuming that an off-peak economy seat from South Africa to the UK would be available for approximately £700, return tickets for flights via South Africa to the UK would take the total price to around £1,300. Due to the runway length and the distance to South Africa (3,700 km to Johannesburg), a Boeing 737-700 flying to Johannesburg serving St Helena would not be able to use its full seat and cargo capacity. Only flights to and from Namibian and Angolan destinations would allow using a Boeing 737-700 near its full load capacity. This was under the condition that both directions of the runway were available so tailwind landings could be avoided. The other planned destination, London, requires a fuel stop in Gambia, at almost the same distance as Johannesburg. However, if Wideawake Airfield on Ascension Island was open for commercial non-military flights, it could be listed as an alternate aerodrome; as it is only 1,300 km from St Helena this would mean that the load capacity of an inbound Boeing 737-700 could be increased as smaller fuel reserves would be required, since the alternate aerodrome could be used in case of problems at St. Helena. It is believed that reductions in ticket prices could be obtained by using spare payload capacity on flights to and from St Helena to carry air freight (e.g., agricultural products, coffee, fish). At 70% passenger load factor a B737-800 operating, on an average day, into St Helena would have a spare payload capacity of some . The extra income possible per in-bound flight from cargo could be as high as the income equivalent of 19 passengers, giving an effective load factor of 88% and could reduce ticket prices. On 16 March 2015 it was announced that SHG and DFID had appointed Comair Limited as the preferred bidder for the provision of air services to St Helena. Comair was proposing a weekly flight between Johannesburg Airport and St Helena using a Boeing 737-800 aircraft, which has a flight time from Johannesburg to St Helena of about four and a half hours. Reaction to the Comair announcement on St Helena was largely negative, with stories of luggage loss and crime in Johannesburg, and the fact that many of St Helena's residents have personal links with Cape Town. On 9 October 2015, Governor Mark Capes indicated that once a month there would be a flight from St Helena to Ascension Island provided by Comair. The Ascension Island Government also announced a connection between the two islands. The connection was to be flown by Comair using a Boeing 737-800. The flight would have taken about two hours to Wideawake Airfield. Comair's air services between St Helena Airport and O. R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg were scheduled to commence in late May 2016, to coincide with the official opening of the airport on 21 May 2016. These dates were postponed because of the problems with wind shear; however, Comair did operate a few test flights which concluded in the windshear risk, mainly for aircraft of that size and larger. Atlantic Star Airlines (operated by TUI Airlines Netherlands) had announced an intention to operate charter flights from London-Gatwick via Gambia (possibly starting May 2016) using a Boeing 737-800, an aircraft requiring a fairly long runway. This leaves Lubango Airport in Angola, at a distance of as the next best diversion option for which every inbound aircraft must carry enough fuel reserve, limiting its load capacity. In response to the wind shear problems, in June 2016 the Governor, Lisa Phillips, noted that restricting flight operations to runway 02, that is northbound landings and southbound starts on St Helena's single operating surface, might be a suitable interim solution. While runway 02 does not suffer from a significant wind shear problem, restricting landings to one direction would prevent large aircraft from calling at St Helena. Only permitting landings in one direction would mean that aircraft must to be able to land in tailwind. Consequently, large aircraft, like the 737-800, could not be used because, in a tailwind, they would need a longer runway than St Helena provides. If runway 20 is used, it will have severe wind restrictions. A debate about the project was held by the House of Lords in London on 17 October 2016. When asked by Lord Foulkes when the government expected commercial flights would start at the airport, the Minister of State, Department for International Development Lord Bates said, \\"scheduled commercial flights will begin when the conditions are considered safe to do so and the St Helena Government are able to contract an airline with the right aircraft and regulatory approval\\". In December 2016, the Saint Helena government issued a tender for an airline to establish a scheduled commercial service, using the less turbulent northbound landing direction only. Atlantic Star Airlines has entered a bid on a proposed plan to base two aircraft at Saint Helena. They would carry up to 60 passengers on round-trip flights from Saint Helena to the international airport in Accra, the capital of Ghana. On 5 February 2017 there was a deadline for airlines to submit application bids for the provision of air services to St Helena under the new requirements, and there were a number of bids. An Airlink Avro RJ85 flew the first charter passengers to and from St. Helena on 3 May 2017 On 3 May 2017, the first commercial charter flight with paying passengers took place. SA Airlink operated the flight from Cape Town, using an Avro RJ85 aircraft with 60 passengers on board. It refueled in Moçâmedes (Angola) when going to St Helena and in Windhoek when going to Cape Town. Technical problems with RMS St Helena meant that the island was isolated for at least two months, so the flight was needed. On 9 June 2017 Airlink won the bid to operate scheduled flights to St Helena Airport. On 22 July 2017 it was announced the airline would operate weekly flights to Johannesburg via Windhoek in Namibia, with a monthly link to Ascension Island. The flights will be on Embraer E190 aircraft filling a maximum of only 76 of the 99 seats due to runway limitations related to the wind shear issues. Airlink conducted a successful proving flight on 23 August 2017 and commenced passenger flights on 14 October 2017. The first scheduled flight landed on 14 October 2017 around 14:00 UTC without any problems, although it was slightly delayed. The flight used the southbound direction, the one with wind shear problems, but the wind was fairly calm. Airlink was after some time denied letting passengers embark and disembark in Windhoek, because Airlink was not given right to carry passengers between Namibia and foreign countries. From April 2019 Airlink refuels in Walvis Bay instead, giving right to have 98 passengers because of shorter distance, having in mind that no connections are allowed in Namibia anyway. The flights still (2019) stop in Windhoek or Walvis Bay for refuel westbound, but fly nonstop to Johannesburg if there is not too much upwind. On Saturday 18 November 2017 Airlink started a monthly charter operation to Ascension Island. After half a year of operation it was found that the regularity was better than expected with only one day of flights delayed until another day, and that ticket demand was higher than expected. The government announced in May 2018 that a second weekly flight will be performed during the southern summer season of December 2018 to April 2019, as well as two more flights to Ascension during the Christmas/New year period. During December 2019 to February 2020 flights went to and from Cape Town, the traditional link to Saint Helena during the boat era.New flights open up Napoleon's hidden Atlantic island to international visitors An Airlink E190 about to refuel in 2020The southern autumn and winter means higher challenges with low clouds and stormy weather.

Beginning March 2020, only residents, citizens or other permitted people were allowed to enter the island, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and all arriving had to stay isolated for two weeks.New restrictions on entry by air to St Helena - 17 March 2020 This and restrictions in South Africa caused the cancellation of all flights to Saint Helena and Ascension from 25 March for a long period.St Helena Cut Off From The World As Flights Grounded, Simple Flying, March 26, 2020 The M/V Helena freight ship still visits the island and medical air evacuation is also possible. A few charter flights were still performed in order to bring in essential medical staff and supplies, people needing to get home etc. On 20 April 2020, an Airbus A318 chartered from Titan Airways flew from London and also conducted six landings to fulfil crew training requirements in anticipation of future flights to the island (because landing with passengers requires a pilot with previous experience with the airport). On 19 May Airlink performed such a flight from Johannesburg. On 19 July the first non-stop return flights from Europe took place when a Bombardier Global 6000 flew from Switzerland to Saint Helena and back to France to evacuate workers for a port construction project.CAN France's 'repatriation' flight left Geneva at 10:18 CEST = 08:18 GMT. As far as I know this was the first non-stop flight from Europe to the island. Geneva-St. Helena in 7 hours and 48 minutes. (19 July 2020) On 30 July 2020 a flight of this type was performed, this time with a Boeing 757-200 from Titan Airways, the largest aircraft to have been on St Helena Airport.Saint FM Community Radio (30 July 2020) Airlines and destinations Aerodrome characteristics, equipment and facilities The airport has been built on Prosperous Bay Plain, on the east side of Saint Helena, entailing a concrete runway length of with taxiway and apron, an approximately rockfill embankment through which a long reinforced concrete culvert was proposed but contractor Basil Read got approval to use an open channel instead.

Facilities Inside the passenger terminal There are two main buildings, the terminal building, and the combined building for airport operations, e.g. air traffic control, rescue services, etc. In addition there are some smaller buildings. The terminal building has a café, a gift shop, a duty-free shop and a restaurant. Navigation aids Doppler VHF omnidirectional range (DVOR) system at St Helena Airport. The distance from key destinations, the length of runway available, and the type of aircraft available in the region dictate that air services to St Helena must operate to the requirements of extended twin engine operations (ETOPS) which implies the provision of an instrument approach system based on an off-set instrument landing system localiser (ILS LLZ).St Helena Access, Project Memorandum Overseas Territories Department, Department for International Development (DFID), January 2005, p. B-6\\"St Helena Access Feasibility Study\\" St Helena Government, Department for International Development, January 2005, p. 104 Such is also required by the terrain of the airport which, in commercial passenger air transport terms, is safety-critical due to its steep approaches, high elevation ( above sea level)\\"St Helena Access Feasibility Study\\" St Helena Government, Department for International Development, January 2005, p. 13 and rocky outcrops. Without an instrument approach the provision of a viable air service would be considered impossible.\\"St Helena Access Feasibility Study\\" St Helena Government, Department for International Development, January 2005, p. 317 Because of the above, St Helena Airport was equipped with an instrument landing system (ILS) and a Doppler VHF omnidirectional range system (DVOR) supplied by Thales Group. Further to that Honeywell Aerospace supplied a SmartPath ground-based augmentation system (GBAS), a technology that augments global positioning system (GPS) signals to make them suitable for precision approach and landing. It overcomes many of the limitations of instrument landing systems (ILS) traditionally used by airports to guide aircraft as they approach the runway.

Hook has won 81 caps for Wales (currently 13th all-time) and is Wales' fourth highest all-time points scorer. Most often playing as a fly-half, Hook is known as a utility player, and has also played as a centre, wing and fullback. He began his club career with Neath, from 2004 to 2006. He then played for the Ospreys (2006–2011), Perpignan (2011–2014) and Gloucester (2014–2016), before returning to the Ospreys in 2016. Hook toured South Africa in 2009 with the British and Irish Lions, making six appearances. He was named on the bench for the third test, but did not play in the game. Early and Personal Life Hook was born in the industrial southern Welsh town of Port Talbot, the second of three children. His brother Mike Hook was also a professional rugby player, and sister Naidine a keen netball player. He attended Glan Afan Comprehensive School in the centre of Port Talbot, and Neath College where he started a half back combination with Martin Roberts. Hook's childhood heroes were Neil Jenkins and Robert Jones – Jenkins because of his kicking ability, and Jones because he played in Hook's favourite position, which was scrum-half, the position he himself played for West Wales at the age of ten. In June 2011, he married long-term partner Kimberley. In 2004 Kimberley was in the U17 Welsh Netball Squad. The couple have a son, born on 23 December 2009. In 2014, Hook announced that Kimberley was pregnant with their second child. Career Hook in action for the Ospreys Club Hook grew up playing schoolboy rugby with the junior and youth set-ups at various Port Talbot-based clubs including Aberavon Quins RFC, Taibach RFC and Corus (Port Talbot) RFC. At senior level and before making the step up to regional rugby with the Ospreys, Hook enjoyed great success for Neath RFC, becoming the record holder for the highest individual points tally within a season. He also played for Neath College as a youngster. Hook played his way into the Ospreys first XV in the 2006–07 Magners League season, giving outstanding performances at both fly-half and inside centre. He kicked a conversion in a Pool 3 match against the Sale Sharks during the 2006-07 Heineken Cup, clinching the Ospreys win following a try from Shane Williams. In November 2010 it was announced that Hook would not be signing a new contract with the Ospreys. On 26 January 2011 James announced that he would be joining French Top 14 side USA Perpignan on a 3-year deal for the 2011–12 season despite warnings from Wales' national coach Warren Gatland that he may not consider players based outside Wales in his future squads. On 2 June 2014, Hook was granted early release from USA Perpignan, following their relegation from the Top 14, to join Gloucester Rugby in the English Aviva Premiership on a three-year contract. On 30 November 2016, Hook rejoined home region Ospreys in Wales on a three-year deal ahead of the 2017–18 season. International After excelling at under-21 level for Wales, Hook starred for the Welsh sevens team, scoring a match-winning try to defeat South Africa Sevens in the plate final of the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Hook made his international debut against Argentina under new Welsh coach Gareth Jenkins, scoring a late try in the match. Hook made his home debut for Wales against Australia on 4 November 2006 as a substitute for the injured Stephen Jones. He showed great composure in scoring 13 points as Wales drew the match 29–29 and was named as Wales' Man of the Match. Hook played against the Pacific Islands, scoring a try, and against Canada where he scored 16 points. During the 2007 Six Nations Championship, Hook played in all of Wales's games, but was hampered by being employed at inside centre, rather than in his preferred position of fly-half for the first four matches. As a result, he struggled to make an impact. In the final game against England, however, he was finally switched to fly-half and produced a Man of the Match-winning performance, scoring 22 points in Wales' 27–18 win. He also completed his first \\"full house\\" in this match (scoring a drop goal, penalty, try and conversion). The victory was Wales' first over a 'Tier One' rugby nation since the 2006 Six Nations Championship victory over Scotland. Hook put in a man-of-the-match performance as he helped Wales beat England 26–19 in the first game of the 2008 Six Nations Championship on 2 February 2008. On 10 February 2008, Hook was selected at fly-half for the 30–15 win over Scotland in the 2008 Six Nations Championship. Hook scored a try and kicked two conversions and a penalty, before being replaced by Stephen Jones in the 58th minute. In May 2009, Hook was included in the 2009 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa. He was called into the squad as a utility back to cover his Wales teammate, Leigh Halfpenny, who was forced to withdraw from the beginning of the tour with a thigh injury. He made his British and Irish Lions debut on 3 June, playing against the Lions Super Rugby team. Hook came off the bench in that game to score one try and kick 3 conversions. He did not however play in a test match on the tour. In 2010, Hook was selected to the Wales 2010 Six Nations Championship team, playing for the first time at outside centre. In January 2011 Hook confirmed he would join French side Perpignan on a three- year contract from the start of the 2011–12 season. His contract guaranteed availability for all of Wales's 2011 Rugby World Cup preparatory games. However, there is no clause covering future release outside of the normal International Rugby Board window. Post rugby career On 13 January 2020, Hook announced his retirement from the game, to take place at the end of the 2019-20 season upon expiration of his contract with the Ospreys. He mentioned wanting to remain involved in rugby by coaching, with focus on skills, but also with his first children-stories book in the release process.

In 349 BC Philip II of Macedon attacked Olynthus, which at the time was an ally of Athens. In the Olynthiacs, delivered in 349 BC, Demosthenes urged Athens to help Olynthus. Historical framework When Philip was enthroned, he cajoled the Chalkidian League, but, after the seizure of Amphipolis and the Macedonian expansion in Thrace, Philip sought for the elimination of the Chalkidian League and for the destruction of its most powerful city, Olynthus. The Olynthians foresaw the danger and struck a deal with the Athenians, who had been their enemies. In 350 BC, Philip had already seized thirty-two cities of the Chalkidike. The next year Olynthus sent successive delegations to Athens, asking desperately for military support, but the Athenians displayed no willingness for a military operation far away from their city. Content of the orations In the First Olynthiac, Demosthenes exhorted the Athenians to vote an expedition at once, to make instant preparation for its dispatch and to send ambassadors to state their intentions and watch events.Demosthenes, First Olynthiac, 3. He then proposed the reform of the \\"theoric fund\\" (\\"Theorika\\" were allowances paid by the state to poor Athenians to enable them to watch dramatic festivals). In the Second Olynthiac, the orator bluntly expressed his annoyance for the dubious stance of his countrymen and for the fact that they remain idle.Demosthenes, Second Olynthiac, 3. He also insisted that Philip was not invincible. In the Third Olynthiac he insulted Philip, characterizing him as a \\"barbarian\\"Demosthenes, Third Olynthiac, 16. and warned his compatriots that the King of Macedon is quick to seize his opportunity, now yielding a point when it suits his purpose. He called for two distinct expeditions; one military force must be dispatched to rescue the Olynthians, and a second force, both naval and military, to ravage Philip's territory.Demosthenes, First Olynthiac, 17. He finally demanded a better utilization of the public money for the attainment of success abroad.Demosthenes, Third Olynthiac, 33 Despite Demosthenes' warnings, the Athenians engaged in a useless war in EuboeaDemosthenes, On the Peace, 5. and offered no military support to Olynthus. When they decided to implement some of his suggestions, the timing was wrong and their troops were inadequate. Assessments The Third Olynthiac is regarded as the best of the three speeches and one of the best political orations of Demosthenes. It is distinguished because of the boldness of the expressed political ideas and the variety of oratorical means and expressions. All the three Olynthiacs demonstrate the passionate spirit of the Athenian statesman and his fervent desire to motivate his countrymen.The Helios.

The village is in the Sutton cum Duckmanton civil parish. Arkwright Town, commonly referred to as Arkwright, is a village in North East Derbyshire, England that is notable for having moved its location in the early 1990s.Metropolitan Housing Trust stakeholders' newsletter, October 2005 Despite its name, the village has no official town status. Located between Chesterfield and Bolsover on the A632 road it was formerly a coal mining village. Arkwright Colliery closed in 1988 and it was then discovered that the community was threatened by emissions of methane gas that caused some of its houses to be evacuated.Simon Beckett \\"Why will the village cross the road?\\", The Independent on Sunday, 17 April 1994 The whole village was owned by British Coal and a decision was taken, along with Derbyshire County Council, to transfer ownership of the 52 properties to a housing trust, construct a new village of 56 properties to the north of the site affected by methane, and move all the residents. Construction was completed by 1995 when the old Arkwright Town was demolished. Part of the deal with British Coal included the use of open cast mining on a 100-acre site which began in November 1993 and continued for some years. A new nature walk was established in 2010 using the uninhabitable waste land that was once used as a railway line.

Transportation features  One of the main features of Irlams o' th' Height is the A6 dual carriageway running through it, with Bolton Road (formerly the A6) running parallel to it. On top of the Irwell Valley on higher ground than Pendleton, hence \\"The Height\\", roads such as Bank Lane go down the valley to Duchy Road. The first part of the name derives from the Irlam family that ran the Pack Horse Inn in the 17th and 18th centuries. It was first recorded in the parish of Eccles in 1180. The village became prosperous in the 19th century due to the Industrial Revolution, and became a well-established community of handloom weavers. Some parts of the area are now designated as a conservation area, centring on Queen Street, King Street and Claremont Road, as these retain the early street pattern. Thirty buildings are recognised as being of archaeological or historic interest in the Greater Manchester Sites and Monuments Register. The conservation area was designated in 1991, and is 1.02 hectares (2.52 acres) in size. Irlams o' th' Height railway station closed in 1955 due to a low number of passengers. It was on the Manchester to Southport Line via Wigan Wallgate. Heading towards Wigan, the preceding station was Pendleton (closed in 1994 after Salford Crescent railway station opened) and the following station was Pendlebury, closed in 1960. Pendleton College on Dronfield Road is on the site of the former Salford Technical High School which later formed part of Salford Grammar Technical School, which closed in 1973. Buile Hill High School is next door on Eccles Old Road (A576), close to Seedley. There is a large Aldi near the junction of the A580, A6 (to Swinton and Walkden) and A666, at the start of the East Lancashire Road (A580 to Leigh and St Helens) and the A666 (to Pendlebury, Clifton, Kearsley and Farnworth). This was originally a Co-op store which began in 1983 as the Shopping Giant store which included a small garden centre at its rear, next to Claremont Road. Just over the Pendlebury boundary stands the parish church of St John the Evangelist, which includes a burial ground. Among those buried there is Geoff Bent, one of eight Manchester United players who died as a result of the Munich air disaster in February 1958. Bent was born locally in 1932.Geoff Bent Irlams o' th' Height has a large number of Manchester United fans, being home to past managers and players and pubs holding supporters' meetings. St John's is also the resting place of the captain of Swinton Rugby League Club, Jim Valentine, an England rugby union international in the late Victorian era. He was killed by lightning at Barmouth, Wales, on Monday 25 July 1904, whilst on holiday, four days before his 38th birthday. His 48 tries in the 1888–89 season still stands as a club record.

Irlam family Since the end of the 16th century, there had been an inn on the (turnpike) road from Manchester and Salford towards Chorley, Preston and Lancaster called the Pack Horse. It was demolished in 1975 due to a large redevelopment of the A580/A6/A666 road junction. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Pack Horse was in the hands of members of the Irlam family, as follows.The Pubs of Swinton & Pendlebury, Neil Richardson and Roger Hall * Thomas Irlam I - to 1600 * Thomas Irlam II - 1600–1620 * Peter Irlam - 1629 * Richard Irlam - 1647–1666 * Robert Irlam - 1684–1702 * Jane Irlam - 1718 * Richard Irlam - 1722–1726 * John Irlam - 1739 * Peter Irlam - 1740–1752 * Martha Irlam - 1754–1768 With the Pack Horse/s being run by the Irlam family for well over a century and a half, it became known locally as \\"Irlam's\\". With its location on ground higher than Pendleton, the area soon became commonly known as \\"The Height\\". Coupled with the Pack Horse being referred to as \\"Irlam's\\", the developing hamlet/village became known as \\"Irlam's on the Height\\" or, as it evolved into today's official name, \\"Irlams o' th' Height\\".

A City New South Wales representative goal-kicker, he played in the NRL for the St. George Illawarra Dragons, Parramatta Eels and the Sydney Roosters, and in the Super League with the Wigan Warriors. St George Illawarra Dragons Riddell eventually made the transition into first grade while playing with his new club side at St George, making his début against local rivals the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks during round one of the 2001 season. During the season he became a regular goal-kicker for the club where he developed a distinctive 'raised arm' motion before he would take the kick. Fans in the crowd would mimic this action. Riddell had an impressive début season in first grade with St. George Illawarra finishing the season as the club's top scorer with 130 points and cemented his position in the side as hooker. During his second season with St. George Illawarra, Riddell would again have a good season not only impressing club staff and fans with his quickly evolving running game from dummy half, goal kicking and strength close to the try line ultimately earning himself a call up to the 2002 international Australian Kangaroos 'train-on' squad but was not selected in the final touring side. He finished the season again as the club's top scorer with 129 points to his name even though he was sidelined during several games in the season through suspension after being sent off twice during the regular season. At the start of the 2003 NRL season, Riddell was criticised amongst some media circles for being slow, out of shape and overweight along with negative talk about discipline problems, however nothing eventuated and he went on to play all twenty-four games of the regular season again finishing as the club's top point scorer with an individual record high of 166 points. In the final round, the injury-ravaged St. George club upset the finals-bound Brisbane Broncos 26-25 with Riddell scoring 18 points of his own, including a last-minute pressure penalty goal 41 metres out from the try line and 10 metres in from touch. This was the two points that won the Dragons the game after having fallen behind through a Darren Lockyer field goal five minutes beforehand. 2004 was again another season of consistent performances for Riddell and several media pundits began speculating on his chances of representing New South Wales in the annual State of Origin, however he was left out of the side but still tasted his first representative experience playing for the City origin side in the annual City vs Country Origin fixture. Salary cap restraints on the club at the conclusion of the season along with several lucrative offers eventuated in a move from the Dragons. Riddell signed with the Parramatta Eels for the 2005 NRL season. He left St. George Illawarra as the club's highest ever point scorer. Parramatta Eels Riddell began the 2005 NRL season with the Parramatta Eels in his regular role of hooker. He had his worst season in regards to point scoring after having to share the goal kicking duties with team mate Luke Burt, finishing the season with only 50 points but ultimately helping his side to the Minor Premiership. Riddell was in the Parramatta side which made it to the preliminary final as favorites against North Queensland Cowboys. In a game that they were expected to win, Parramatta were beaten 29-0 in one of the biggest upsets of the season. In 2017, Riddell spoke of the disappointment to miss out on qualifying for the grand final in 2005 by saying \\"The worst thing was that we had watched St George lose to Wests Tigers the night before and we had comfortably beat Wests twice that year and thought we were morals for the premiership\\". On 17 May 2006, Riddell was dropped from the Parramatta first grade side and fined a total of $5,000 for failing to show up to a recovery session on a Monday morning following a regular season fixture, he later admitted the reason he had failed to show up to the session was because he was intoxicated. His axing, along with that of Tim Smith's, was the first piece of action taken by Jason Taylor who just moments earlier was appointed caretaker coach following long-serving coach Brian Smith's dismissal. In the 2007 NRL season, Riddell made 23 appearances for Parramatta as the club made the preliminary final but fell short of a grand final appearance losing to Melbourne 26-10. Riddell stayed with at Parramatta through the 2008 NRL season, playing a total of 86 games for Parramatta. Wigan Warriors Riddell playing for the Wigan Warriors in 2010 Riddell signed a three-year deal with the Wigan Warriors starting from 2009. Riddell played for Wigan for two years of his three-year contract. In 2010, Riddell was part of the Warriors side that won the League Leaders' Shield. He played in the 2010 Super League Grand Final victory over St. Helens at Old Trafford, adding his name to the Grand Final score sheet by successfully kicking a penalty goal. After the 2010 season, Riddell was released from the last year of his contract so that he could return to Australia to tend to his ill mother.https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/roosters-sign-mark-riddell- from-under-the-nose-of-the-wests-tigers/news- story/5b62af6315b7b932c35d2c7f95d1f7fd?sv=1075af538e5da53985ece5512993c568 Sydney Roosters After his release from Wigan in 2010, Riddell made his return to NRL for the 2011 season, this time with the Sydney Roosters, the club he had represented at a junior level in the SG Ball and Presidents Cup competitions.https://www.nrl.com/news/2010/12/14/riddell-returns-to-the- roosters/ Riddell was poised to sign with the Wests Tigers, however Tigers coach Tim Sheens made it clear that Riddell was unlikely to get much game time with the first grade side, barring injury, rep duties or suspension of star hooker Robbie Farah. Linking to the Roosters ensured Riddell would reunite with Brian Smith, whom he played under at the Eels for one and a half seasons. Also in 2011, Riddell was recruited by the Sydney Morning Herald to write a weekly column. It was published for that year only. Riddell announced his retirement in June 2011. Post playing career In 2012, Riddell was simultaneously coach of the Australian women's team and the Sydney Roosters SG Ball Cup side. He was also playing for The Oaks in the Group 6 country competition.https://www.camdenadvertiser.com.au/story/241368/piggy-in-the- middle/ Riddell is currently a commentator for Sydney radio station 2GBhttp://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/whats-the-buzz-tedescos-tigers- future-in-doubt-ennis-needs-a-guard-piggy-riddells-backyard-league-pitch/news- story/a2910a4758c706906fb9e62b45e89278 as well as co-hosting Macquarie Sports Radio breakfast show with fellow 2GB commentator Mark Levy.

He demanded to abolish the road tax in addition to the eco-tax, it is sufficient if \\"only the real consumption\\" will be touched by mineral oil from the Treasury. Neither he as economy minister in the federal government since 2009 nor the FDP voiced these demands again. State aid for Opel On 9 June 2010 Brüderle refused a request from Opel Germany to 1.1 billion euro in the form of state aid. On the same day Chancellor Angela Merkel gave Opel vague hope of a bailout stating: \\"The last word on the future of Opel is still out.\\" \\"The state is not the better entrepreneur\\" was a justification Brüderle for his vote. The state aid would have resulted in his opinion, to serious distortions of competition in the industry. However, a government decision, there was not, as General Motors and Opel / Vauxhall in Europe applied for no more state aid .

He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1963. Background Armed was sired by the great stakes winner Bull Lea, the sire of Citation. His dam was Armful, whose sire was Belmont Stakes winner Chance Shot and whose grandsire was the great Fair Play. Besides being small for his age and very headstrong, Armed had the habits of biting and kicking hay out of his handler's pitchfork. Since he was also practically untrainable, his trainer, Ben A. Jones, sent him back to Calumet Farm to be gelded and turned out to grow up. He returned to the track late in his two- year-old season and resumed training. Racing career His first start was as a three-year-old the following February, and he won at Hialeah Park by eight lengths. He won again less than a week later but then won only once in five more starts and had to be rested due to an ankle injury. Armed raced for seven seasons, from 1944 to 1950, finishing with a 41-20-10 record in 81 starts. On April 20, 1946, under jockey Douglas Dodson Armed broke the track record for a mile and a sixteenth on dirt with a winning time of 1:43 1/5 in the Philadelphia Handicap at the Havre de Grace Racetrack. In 1947, again ridden by jockey Dodson, he defeated U.S. Triple Crown champion Assault in a match race at Belmont Park and set a track record of 2:01-3/5 for one and one- quarter miles while winning the Widener Handicap and carrying 129 pounds. He repeated as American Champion Older Male Horse and was voted 1947 American Horse of the Year honors. In the Horse of the Year poll conducted by Turf and Sport Digest magazine, he received 151 of a possible 173 votes to win the title from Citation, Stymie, Bewitch and Assault. Retirement and death Armed died in 1964 of an intestinal tumor. In 1963, he was inducted into National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

History Some records state that there was a building of some construction on the site of the castle in 1130 and used by Roger De Mowbray. The earliest extant building on the site is the ruin of a quadrangular castle, probably begun in 1327 by Geoffrey Scrope, which was reputedly demolished in the Civil War. His son, Henry continued the building work. The last mention in records of the castle are in 1660. Surveys revealed that the part of the southeast tower (Kitchen Tower) remained, as did the foundations for the south and west walls. The north and eastern structures of the old castle now lie beneath ground level. Mason markings are still visible, including the faded arms of the Scrope family. The castle, the old Gatehouse located west of the present day Garden Cottage and the remains of the old castle walls are all listed monuments. This castle was replaced by a manor house, which was rebuilt in the 19th century and then rebuilt again following destruction by fire in 1918. The castle was part of the manor of the Scrope family until 1520, when it passed to Elizabeth, the daughter of Thomas Scrope, wife of Sir Ralph Fitz Randolph. It then passed again via his daughter, Agnes, to her son Christopher Wyvill, son of Ripon MP, Sir Marmaduke Wyvill. After this it passed to the Crown in 1577, before coming into the hands of the Constable family. They held it until 1768 when it was purchased briefly by William Chapman who sold it the Turton family. Upsall castle is part of the Upsall and Roxby estates owned by the Turton family. The present owner of the castle is Gerald Turton.  Legends  John Constable, who resided at the castle in 1610, was a supporter of the Royal cause during the Civil War. The 19th-century writers William Grainge and John Gilbert Baker noted that he reportedly left a curse on any owner of Upsall who should prove disloyal to his king and country. The writers also recounted a folklore story of a man who dug under a bush at Upsall Castle, finding a pot of gold; later on, a stranger revealed to him that there was another pot of gold buried under the first, which he then dug up as well.

The R136 road is a regional road in Ireland, located in the southwest of Dublin. Named the Outer Ring Road, the route, which is dual carriageway, runs from the N4 at Lucan to the N81 at Tallaght, bypassing west of Clondalkin (around Grange Castle) and crossing the N7 near Citywest. It was built as part of the planning for the new town of Adamstown. Route The route was legislated in 2006 as commencing along the R835 near Lucan (Adamstown), and running south via Ballyowen Distributor Road and Grange Castle Road to Kingswood Interchange on the N7 (Junction 2). This forms \\"Phase 1\\" of the planned outer ring road (the M50 motorway being an inner ring road which should not be confused with the Inner Orbital Route, an Inner Ring in the inner City). Phase 2, which opened in December 2006, commences at the N4 road east of Lucan, passing through Ballyowen, with a junction for Adamstown, before linking up with the existing road at Grange Castle. Almost the entire route is a dual carriageway, apart from the bridge over the N4. From the N4 to Adamstown, there is only one traffic lane and a bus lane in each direction (As the carriageways are separated by a jersey barrier this is still technically a dual carriageway). From Adamstown to Kingswood, the route has two lanes and a bus lane in each direction. However all junctions, other than the N4 junction and N7 flyover, are at-grade, and the median is rather narrow. R136 dual carriageway at Grange Castle The term Outer Ring Road should not be confused with Outer Orbital Route, which refers to an indicative plan to construct a second motorway bypass ring around Dublin (after the M50), further out from the city. Nor should it be confused with the existing Outer Orbital Route which circles the inner city in the Dublin City Council area, outside the Inner Orbital Route. Phase 3 of the road opened in July 2008, from the Kingswood Interchange (N7 J2) to the N81 Tallaght Bypass in Tallaght. This road was half a new build, half an upgrade of Cheeverstown Road and the junction of Cheeverstown Road and the N81. This section also included a provision for Luas Line A1 to cross it (tracks in the roadway). This facilitated works on the line, which began in February 2009, to proceed without having to make any further alterations to the road. Potential upgrades Although provision had been made for the route to head further northwards, crossing the Liffey and joining the R121 road at Porterstown, the future bridge to be built linking these points will be for the proposed Metro West only. Such a road link would have linked with existing relatively high grade sections of the R121 to provide a ring road link from Cherryhound at the M2 in the north west of Dublin's suburbs back to the N81 to the south west. Planning dispute When this road was being planned it was opposed by various interests.http://www.rte.ie/news/2001/0626/road.html Planning dispute 2001 It was eventually completed with the semi-rural section through Grange Castle built as standard dual carriageway; two traffic lanes plus hard shoulder in each direction. It remained unopened for a time as Dublin City Council insisted that the bus lane run outside the hard shoulder so as to leave only one traffic lane (effectively the bus-lane would run down the centre of either carriageway). The local authority (South Dublin County Council) refused to open the road with such a bizarre arrangement and eventually the City Council relented.

J. Phelan, was the first appointed international civil servant and fourth Director-General of the International Labour Office, serving from 1941 to 1948, during most of which time the ILO was temporarily relocated to Montréal from Geneva. Phelan was the principal author of the Declaration of Philadelphia.  Early years  Edward Phelan was born in Tramore, County Waterford, on the south coast of Ireland. His father, Thomas, who came from nearby Cheekpoint was a ship's captain, as was his grandfather. When he was seven years of age his father was employed on the transatlantic liner route and the family moved to Liverpool in England. He retained a strong sense of his Irish identity, and returned every year for holidays. In Liverpool he attended St. Francis Xavier's College and at University College Liverpool where he studied mathematics. He received an Honours degree in Physics, to which he added a B.A in anticipation of joining the British Civil Service. His first posting was to the Board of Trade where he investigated social issues such as cost of living, rent and housing conditions in England and Scotland. Phelan wanted to see the world, so he resigned his secure job and began to work for George Lunn Tours Ltd. a tourist agency with headquarters at Lugano, Switzerland, near the Italian border.Irish Times, 3 June 1950, p. 5  Civil Service  Phelan was contacted by the Board of Trade to participate in an enquiry into housing conditions in South Wales. Although he was very much enjoying his new job and the opportunities it afforded him to travel, he returned to London to resume duties at the Civil Service. The outbreak of the First World War ensured the suspension of the enquiry and he was instead assigned to the newly established Ministry of Labour at Montagu House, Whitehall. Phelan accompanied Bruce Lockhart as the first British delegation to meet the Bolsheviks in Moscow in January 1918,just as the Finnish civil war commenced and coincidental with the Brest-Litovsk negotiations.Lockhart, p. 205 At the beginning of March Phelan returned to England and his work at the Ministry of Labour where he headed a think-tank dealing with 'foreign questions'. In the Autumn of 1918 he suggested that the Ministry should formulate a policy position for the anticipated peace treaties. Phelan referred to this decision as the conception of the ILO.Irish Times, 3 June 1950, p. 5 Lloyd George approved the initiative and Phelan became secretary to George Barnes of the British peace delegation.  International Labour Office  A few months after the signing of the Versailles treaty and prior to its ratification, Phelan and Harold Butler organised the inaugural meeting of the ILO in Washington. As Director-General, he was preceded by John Gilbert Winant and succeeded by David A. Morse.

It is generally characterised by a below-average rate of economic growth, where growth is occurring at an unsustainable rate. Boom periods are often characterised by overheating in the economy. An economy is said to be overheated when inflation increases due to prolonged good growth rate and the producers produce in excess thereby creating excess production capacity. The main reason behind overheating is insufficient supply allocation because of excess spending by the people due to increase in consumer wealth. Causes High levels of aggregate demand tend to be the cause of overheating. If short run aggregate demand exceeds long run aggregate supply, then the excess demand for goods must be met via the over- employment of resources. This may be achieved by employing workers for extra shifts or using machinery beyond their recommended working hours. This type of production is considered unsustainable because the over-employment cannot be supported indefinitely. Overheating can be prevented by means of constant infrastructure expansion to eliminate bottlenecks. Effects Overheating is generally preceded by lower than average economic growth. Demand pull inflation occurs as suppliers try to capitalize on the excess demand which cannot be met via existing production constraints. These higher prices tend to reduce aggregate demand and exports (since goods and services become more expensive abroad) leading to reduced consumption. Central banks often simultaneously tighten monetary policy in response to increased inflationary pressures, reducing investment expenditure, which in tandem with decreased consumption, can lead to economic recession.

She is first introduced as a supporting character in the original Silent Hill, and later returns as the protagonist and player character of Silent Hill 3. In the first game, Heather is the daughter of protagonist Harry Mason. She is also secretly the reincarnation of and , and is instrumental to antagonist Claudia Wolf's efforts to bring about the rebirth of \\"God\\". Heather and Cheryl Mason are also fused into a single character, Cheryl Heather Mason, for Silent Hill: Shattered Memories, a reimagination of the original Silent Hill; at the end of the story, she is revealed to be the game's true protagonist. Heather is also the main character of the 2012 film Silent Hill: Revelation, in which she is played by Adelaide Clemens. Appearances Heather is the protagonist of the video game Silent Hill 3 and of the film Silent Hill: Revelation. In the video game Silent Hill: Shattered Memories, \\"Heather\\" is a middle name of the main character Cheryl. Heather is also a downloadable content character in the video game Silent Hill: Book of Memories. In addition, she makes cameo appearances in some of the endings in Book of Memories and in the video game Silent Hill: Downpour, as well as in an unrelated Konami game Dance Dance Revolution Extreme. Heather appears as Cheryl in the Dead by Daylight game alongside Pyramid Head. Design and portrayal Heather was initially modeled after French actresses Charlotte Gainsbourg and Vanessa Paradis in several rough sketches. The sketches portrayed her as an \\"innocent\\" type of character. The development team realized that she seemed too \\"nice\\" and the next version of Heather was inspired by Sophie Marceau and Gainsbourg to give her an attitude. At this point, Heather was a clash of masculinity and femininity. The character designer Shingo Yuri imagined Heather as wearing jeans, but the female team members of Team Silent thought that Heather should show her legs to look more feminine and convinced Yuri. Heather's hair was initially more natural and less elaborate, but the female team members thought that curly hair would be more suitable for a young girl. Heather was given shorter hair for the convenience of video games: it would have taken more processing power of the PlayStation 2 to animate longer realistic hair and the game designers used the processing power towards increasing monster numbers instead. Heather's original design was later used with Elle Holloway, a character in Silent Hill: Homecoming. The character's name and model were inspired by her original voice actress, Heather Morris, who was also motion capture actress, including for combat scenes during which she used her childhood taekwondo training.Retrogamer, Heather Mason Speaks! An Interview with Heather Morris , The Gaming Liberty, January 1, 2012. The creators originally named Heather \\"Helen\\", but after talking with Morris they realized that name was old- fashioned and changed it (in early promotional materials and the back of the game's original cover, the character still has the name Heather Morris, same as the actress).Book of Lost Memories. Konami, 2003. Pg 66-67, \\"Silent Hill 3 Character Commentary\\". Morris said: \\"I liked the character Heather. She is sort of a bad-ass and a bit of a tomboy. Although she was very young, she was quite fearless and strong. I did respond well to the script. Heather was really interesting and a great character to play. ... Much like the character, Heather, I was learning about all the horrendous things in this video game world as I moved through it. So I was genuinely surprised and disturbed. Very often I would ask to stop the motion capture so we could look on the computer at the images that represented the monsters and people with whom I was supposed to be interacting. And they were creepy and quite scary. Since we were working on a blank stage, we really need to use our imagination.\\" Adelaide Clemens as Heather in the film Silent Hill: Revelation In contrast to Morris, Adelaide Clemens, who played Heather in Revelation, had to work with physically existing monsters on the film's set. She said \\"I really took on the role of Heather Mason herself—the psychological journey that she’s going on. ... [W]ith the mythology of the game, the gravity of what the monsters are—what they mean; their symbolism, and all of those things—I did research the game, and look into the ‘history’ of Silent Hill, and what has been created there in the franchise. And, physically! I had to get incredibly strong, and incredibly fit—just really immerse myself in Heather Mason.\\" Reception In Silent Hill: The Terror Engine, Bernard Perron wrote that Heather's \\"temper\\" and \\"sharp tongue\\" served to distinguish her from the female protagonists of the survival-horror games Rule of Rose (2006), Clock Tower 3 (2002), and Fatal Frame (2001), whom he described as being characterized as \\"more frail or innocent\\". Game Revolution's Chris Hudak preferred Heather over the prior protagonists of the series, Silent Hills Harry Mason and Silent Hill 2s James Sunderland, whom he felt were \\"bland\\"; he praised her \\"attitude, some vulnerability and even some snarky teenaged wit\\". Joystick Division's James Hawkins praised Heather for how she \\"show[ed] the world that whiny teenage girls can become incredible badasses\\", putting her on the tenth place of his 2010 list of the top ten \\"badass ladies\\" in video game history. That same year, Mania Entertainment's \\"Briana Lawrence\\" ranked her fifth on her list of \\"13 Video Game Women That Kick Ass\\", calling Heather a \\"really cool lead character\\". Schuyler J. Dievendorf of The Escapist included her on his 2014 list of eight \\"most badass videogame ladies\\" as she \\"has gone through hell and become numbed to the nightmare. After seeing the things that she's seen most people would have cracked, but she keeps going.\\" GameDaily listed Heather in their \\"Babe of the Week: Chicks with Baggage\\", and GamesRadar cited her as one of the best game \\"babes\\" in the decade of 2000, highlighting the fact that she is \\"just a normal girl\\". CNET shared the sentiments, adding she \\"may not have the toughness of some of the other protagonists here, but Heather Mason is absolutely human and eminently relatable\\". UGO Networks writers placed the character second on its 2011 list of the best kids in video games, also featuring her on their list of the \\"most stylin'\\" alternate costumes for her \\"Sailor Moon-esque character\\" Princess Heather costume. In 2013, Complex ranked Heather as the 36th greatest heroine in video game history, stating that they still \\"love\\" her \\"despite the massive pile of fail known as Silent Hill Revelation 3D.\\" According to Leigh Alexander of GamePro, \\"for years, video games have struggled to define what constitutes a positive portrayal of women. We've learned what isn't, over our checkered history of anime panty shots, gratuitous cleavage and breast physics. And thanks to the likes of Half-Life 2s Alyx Vance, Beyond Good & Evils Jade, Silent Hill 3s Heather Morris [sic], and Portals Chell, we've got some idea of what is.\\" However, one essay in Unraveling Resident Evil criticized Heather as following a \\"traditional trope\\" of a \\"sexless child\\" similar to the role of \\"a virgin or tomboy, Rebecca and Claire\\" in the Resident Evil series of horror games by Capcom, contrasting them with Resident Evil's Ada.Nadine Farghaly (edited), Unraveling Resident Evil: Essays on the Complex Universe of the Games and Films.

During seven full seasons at De Kuip, he formed an efficient winger partnership with Regi Blinker (from 1991 to 1995, the pair combined for 61 Eredivisie goals). In July 1997, after nearly 300 official games with Feyenoord, Taument signed with Portugal's Benfica, but failed to establish himself at the club, scoring just once in a Taça de Portugal tie against Rio Ave. Click on magnifying glass icon at end of row for details. He moved in the next transfer window to Anderlecht, also being rarely played during his tenure.

Development In 1962, despite internal opposition from those who felt it would dilute the macho image of the brand, Triumph introduced a new scooter, designed by Edward Turner, to tap into a strong demand that had been identified by market research for a simple and easy-to-ride \\"shopping basket\\" vehicle. The Tina used a continuously variable transmission (CVT) system with a centrifugal clutch; the system had been patented by Turner and Triumph in May 1959. The engine was mounted on the swingarm. An extensive marketing campaign was carried out, fronted by a pop star of the era, Cliff Richard. The Tina was marketed to women, and advertising focused on the ease of its operation. Despite this the Tina sold in small numbers. The Tina's patented drivetrain had technical problems. The CVT drive belt would derail and seize the transmission and the rear wheel, not only disabling the scooter but also preventing it from being pushed. Also, the starting procedure for the Tina required moving a switch on the handlebar to \\"start\\" before kick starting the scooter. This activated a governor to keep the engine speed too low to activate the transmission. If the switch were to be left in \\"drive\\" while the scooter was being started, then the motorcycle would accelerate immediately. This happened to Turner, resulting in a crash into a curb and a broken ankle. T10 The Tina was replaced by the Triumph T10 in 1965. The T10 included an improved CVT and the \\"start/drive\\" control moved from the handlebar to inside the seat, where the \\"drive\\" setting would be activated by the rider's weight. This weight-activated switched ensured that the rider was seated before the drive was engaged. This led to an embarrassing incident while demonstrating the T10 at its press launch. The switch had been set at , but the woman who was to ride the scooter away weighed only , the switch was not activated, and the scooter would not move. The T10 was discontinued about 1970. Three-wheeled prototypes Triumph made a series of twelve prototype Tina tilting three-wheelers, similar in concept to the Ariel 3 moped. Disagreements between Triumph and the system's designer ended any plans for production.

In his rousing call for resistance, Demosthenes urged the Athenians to be ready for war and called for a great outpouring of effort. He even proposed a reform of the theoric fund (\\"theorika\\"), a mainstay of Eubulus' policy.J. De Romilly, A Short History of Greek Literature, 116-117. \\"Theorika\\" were allowances paid by the state to poor Athenians to enable them to watch dramatic festivals. Eubulus passed a law making it difficult to divert public funds, including \\"theorika\\", for minor military operations. Demosthenes encouraged his countrymen, trying to convince them that the defeats they suffered were due to their mistakes and to Philip's competence. The orator opposed the use of mercenaries in the Athenian army and proposed the creation of a flexible military force, which would remain in Macedon and harass Philip's army. Despite the passionate style of the orator, it seems that ecclesia did not espouse his views and insisted in the ensuing military preparations, obliging Demosthenes to repeat the same argumentation in the Olynthiacs.The Helios.

The entry of the BSA group into the scooter field was announced by Edward Turner in October 1958. The 250 cc model would have a cruising speed of and petrol consumption of . A prototype 250 cc BSA Sunbeam was displayed at the 1958 Earl's Court Cycle and Motor Cycle Show.The Times (London); 30 October 1958 page 6, 15 November 1958 page 5 Manufacture started in late 1959, but delivery difficulties were acknowledged due to problems with recruiting labour, although it was claimed that the group had a manufacturing capacity of 50,000 machines a year.The Times (London); 19 November 1959 page 20, 9 March 1961 page 21 The design by Edward Turner drew on Triumph's long experience of building fast motorcycles, and was sold under two brand names to take advantage of established distribution networks. This badge engineering was one of the last uses of the Sunbeam marque. The differences between the BSA Sunbeam and Triumph Tigress were entirely cosmetic - the former in polychromatic green paint, also two-tone red and cream, with a BSA badge; the latter in a shell blue or mimosa and ivory (two tone) with Triumph badging. The scooter was available with a 250 cc four-stroke twin (10 hp) or 175 cc two-stroke single-cylinder engine (7,5 hp). Both engines were forced-air- cooled and curbed to keep low petrol consumption. The two-stroke was a development of the BSA Bantam engine but the four-stroke was a completely new parallel-twin with gear rather than chain drive to the gearbox. The contact- breaker fed two ignition coils, each of which had a lead to its spark plug without a distributor. Drive to the rear wheel was by a fully enclosed chain in an oil bath. Both versions had four, foot-operated gears. Some of the 250 twins were fitted with an electric starter and a 12 volt (not 6 volt) electrical system. The 250 twin sold well and could do 70 mph (105 km/h) with efficient suspension and good roadholding despite having only 10-inch wheels. The weight was low in comparison to other scooters (100/110 kg).BSA Tigress. Kraftfahrzeugtechnik 9/1960, page 367. The only problem was build quality: it was sometimes said that a Tigress was a joy to own so long as someone else was paying the repair bills. The 250 cc four-stroke model was discontinued in 1964, the 175 cc two-stroke model in 1965. Later in the 1960s, despite internal opposition from those who felt that scooters would dilute the macho image of the brand, Triumph (owned by BSA) produced another scooter and a motor tricycle for \\"shoppers\\". The Triumph Tina and the Ariel 3 tricycle (BSA also owned the Ariel marque) were intended to tap into the market segment for a convenient 'shopping basket'.

Most are maintained locally by county highway departments. County route designations are assigned at the county level; as a result, routes often change numbers as they cross from one county to the next due to the lack of a statewide numbering system and lack of coordination between counties. Some exceptions exist, such as County Route 36 (CR 36) in Ontario County and CR 36A in Livingston County. The assignment of routes by individual counties also results in varying system density and numbering and signage practices between the state's counties. Numbering and layout The exact method of county route numbering varies by county. Some counties, such as Dutchess County, use a system in which county route numbers are assigned by town in alphabetical order while others like Monroe County assign numbers in a general west-to-east fashion. Still others, for instance Livingston County, have no defined pattern. The highest-numbered posted county route and the only four-digit county route signed as such in the state, CR 1345, resides in Saratoga County. Like the numbering system and the choice of signage, the complexity of the county highway system varies by county as well. Erie County, for example, one of the most urbanized counties in Upstate New York, maintains a system of nearly 400 routes. In contrast, the Southern Tier county of Tioga manages only 29 roads. Signage The method that each county employs to sign its routes varies from one county to the next. The majority of counties in New York use the MUTCD-standard blue pentagonal shield with yellow lettering. Others tweak this shield slightly, using white lettering instead of yellow (particularly in areas near the Capital District) or using shapes similar to a pentagon. Additionally, Orange County employs a wide assortment of signage, ranging from the standard blue pentagonal shield to a blue diamond with white lettering. On the other hand, some counties, such as Orleans and Westchester counties, do not post signage along their routes. Most of New York switched to the MUTCD-standard blue pentagon shield ca. 1974. Signs that predate this transition can still be found in certain areas of the state.

The town was founded by members of the Jesuit order in 1850. The name, bestowed by Austrian Jesuit priest Aloysius Kranewitter, is in homage to the seven hills of Rome. History The first Jesuits in the locality were based in Clare from 1848. They were being urged by Catholic Prussians at Tanunda, who felt uncomfortable among the more numerous Lutheran Prussians, to establish a Catholic settlement in the Clare district and so began a search for a suitable locality. Section 91 in the Hundred of Clare had been purchased in 1850 as a speculation by Thomas Burr, former Deputy Surveyor General of South Australia. Jesuit priest Aloysius Kranewitter was delighted with the prospects of the hilly and fertile location and, through his influence, Burr surveyed this land into allotments for leasing, which became the township of Sevenhill. In December 1850, in consultation with Burr, the allotment layout and limits of the new settlement were settled by Kranewitter. By January 1851 Kranewitter was calling the future site Sevenhill Township. The first lots became available from April 1851, all for 31 years' lease with easy right of purchase terms, and soon many Catholics, particularly Irish, Polish, and German, were moving there from Kapunda, Tanunda, Burra and other districts. Over time, particularly during the 1930s and 1940s, it became unclear whether the correct name of the township was Sevenhill, or Sevenhills, arousing debate. Clare philatelist Albert Fryar provided conclusive evidence (cuttings from envelopes and postal cancellations) that the original title was indeed Sevenhill.\\"Should Sevenhill Be Called Sevenhill or Sevenhill(s)\\" (13 August 1943). The Northern Argus, p. 8. Retrieved 15 October 2015. Saint Aloysius Church, seminary and college In 1851, at about the same time that Burr and Kranewitter established the township, the Jesuits established the current Saint Aloysius Church and Sevenhill Winery about one kilometre east, nearer the Hill River. Local settler Francis Weikert, who donated land for the establishment, is buried in the Sevenhill cemetery. In September 1851, Brother Schreiner brought some vine rootlings from Bungaree Station, beginning the Sevenhill vineyard, leading to a flourishing wine industry. In 1856, Saint Aloysius' College was established. By 1866 the college was housed in fine buildings in extensive grounds, including playing fields. Renowned throughout Australia, it was at that time the only Roman Catholic educational establishment in South Australia, having pupils from nearly all the other colonies of Australia.Bailliere's South Australian Gazetteer, 1866, p. 201. The college operated until 1886, by which time Catholic education was more widely available. Beside secular education for all creeds, the establishment included a seminary which trained young men for priesthood in the Catholic Church, which continued well after closure of the college. Fr. Julian Tenison-Woods, its first and perhaps most famous extern, prepared for ordination there under Fr. Joseph Tappeiner May–November 1856. Other secular priests who studied there were C. A. Reynolds (first Archbishop of Adelaide), Frederick Byrne (Vicar General), Frs. Plormel and Brecas the younger, of the Rockhampton Diocese, Peter Jorgensen, and Thomas Guilfoyle, all of whom were there for two years; and George Williams (11), Edmund O'Brien (8), and Michael O'Sullivan (5).  Railway  A railway line was built from Riverton to Clare in 1919 and on to Spalding in 1922. It closed in 1974 and the tracks were removed in the 1980s, but the alignment now carries the Riesling Trail cycling and walking path. Present The nearby town of Clare serves many of the commercial needs of the Sevenhill district, and is a centre of government administration. Sevenhill supports a hotel, a regional cellar door showcasing wines from more than a dozen boutique producers, a gourmet bakery (the only bakery in the region), a homewares shop, several bed and breakfast cottages, a Country Fire Service station and an antique shop. The community hall is also used as a weekend market stall and Friday night bingo is a tradition. Several of the region's famous wineries and cellar doors are located east and west of Sevenhill. Pikes Winery adjoins the former St Aloysius' college. The town's oval is found east of the main cross road and has toilet facilities. It supports a cricket team during the summer months and tennis facilities are also located here. Sevenhill is at the \\"heart\\" of the Clare Valley and a hub for the locals and tourists visiting the region. It is a suitable place for access to the Riesling Trail walking and cycling route just east of the town, with off-road parking facilities available. Geography and climate Sevenhill is sited in hilly country at the head of the Hutt River. The township itself lays in a small level plain, but surrounding Sevenhill, particularly to the east and west, are rugged ranges, some scrub covered, which run generally north-south. The district is mainly agricultural, with a mixture of grazing, cropping and vineyards. The township, which has a small population, is on a section of the Main North Road known as the Horrocks Highway.  Governance  Sevenhill is governed at the local level by the District Council of Clare and Gilbert Valleys. Sevenhill lies in the state electoral district of Frome and the federal electoral division of Grey.

History  Consumer Buyline Fight Back! made its television debut in September 1976. When the show initially premiered it was shown locally on KNBC television in Los Angeles. At its inception, the show was called California Buyline. This weekly show was one of the first consumer information shows to be taped in front of a live studio audience. Topics on California Buyline ranged from sneaky product labels to money saving tips and ideas. In mid-1977, California Buyline changed its name to Consumer Buyline, and was nationally syndicated as of January 1978 through NBC O&O; stations such as WNBC-TV (New York). Consumer Buyline continued to run until August 1980. Fight Back! In February 1980, the pilot episode of Fight Back! With David Horowitz was broadcast. As explained in a news article, Fight Back! was the same show as Consumer Buyline, but with a \\"larger budget.\\" The pilot episode featured a segment shot in North Carolina, as well as a commercial challenge of a Volkswagen Rabbit. Fight Back! formally replaced \\"Consumer Buyline\\" in September 1980. As before with Consumer Buyline, Fight Back! was initially syndicated by Group W Productions, and aired through NBC O&O; stations (and some NBC affiliates) as well as some independent television stations. For the 1984-1985 season, distribution moved from Group W Productions to Paramount Television & King Features Entertainment. As a result, Fight Back! expanded into even more markets, and became an instant weekend favorite. Radio After wrapping production of Fight Back! on television, David Horowitz went on to host a weekly radio show of the same name on KGIL 1260AM, a Los Angeles talk station. The radio version of Fight Back! covered many of the same topics covered on his original television shows. Present After the television show wrapped, David Horowitz continued work under the Fight Back! banner. Since 2013 the Fight Back! brand has been owned and operated by David Horowitz's daughter Amanda Horowitz, who has continued the work after her father's 2019 death.https://fightback.com/about/  Popular segments  Fight Back! was unusual in that it blended hard-hitting journalism with humor. Two of the most popular segments on this show were the \\"Fight Back! Commercial Challenge\\" and the \\"Horror File.\\" The \\"Commercial Challenge\\" first appeared on Consumer Buyline on October 10, 1977. The challenge was that of an Imperial Margarine commercial, which stated that people couldn't tell the difference between Imperial margarine and butter. Horowitz went to an LA supermarket, and had 11 people try crackers with each product on it, to see who could tell the difference. In the end, all 11 people picked the butter over Imperial margarine. The following week was a taste test between Coca-Cola and Pepsi (more people did pick Pepsi over Coke). In the 15th anniversary special, it is mistakenly reported that the first commercial challenge aired in December 1977, where David Horowitz decided to challenge a commercial for a Timex watch. Per the commercial, former Timex pitchman John Cameron Swayze strapped a Timex watch to an outboard motor, and raced the motor through a tank of water. At the end of the commercial, the watch was still ticking. Horowitz performed this challenge with two other watches (a Seiko and a Citizen). All three watches passed the test. The Commercial Challenge proved to be so popular, that one particular episode of Fight Back! was devoted to nothing but commercial challenges (title of show: \\"30 challenges in 30 minutes\\"). Other commercials challenged over the years included: * Krazy Glue (Tested on multiple occasions, first premiering on Consumer Buyline, where it failed - not once, but twice. Subsequent re-tests on Fight Back! showed the product to pass.) * Glad Trash Bags (Tested several times. Challenges ranged from bags being kicked down a flight of stairs, to having an elephant step on one.

His most notable work was the novel La Guerre des boutons (1912) (English: The War of the Buttons). It has been reprinted more than 30 times, and is included on the French high-school curriculum.Tobias Grey, \\"Waging War(s) of the Buttons in France\\", Wall Street Journal, 15 September 2011, accessed 2 November 2012 A schoolteacher by profession, Pergaud came into conflict with Roman Catholic authorities over the implementation of the Third French Republic's separation of Church and State enacted in 1905. In 1907 Pergaud chose to move to Paris to pursue his literary career. Pergaud's prose works are often considered to reflect the influences of Realist, Decadent and Symbolist movements. He was killed at age 33 in April 1915, by French fire while in a field hospital behind German lines; he was serving with the French Army near Marchéville-en- Woëvre during the First World War. The War of the Buttons has been adapted five times as a film, four times in French productions and once in an Irish one. It was adapted most recently in France in two films released the same week in September 2011. Both were set during the twentieth century.  Early life  Pergaud was born on 22 January 1882, in Belmont, Doubs. Son of a republican schoolmaster, Louis was encouraged to excel in his studies. His academic successes earned him scholarships permitting him to continue school with the intention of following in his father's footsteps. In 1901 he completed his studies at the École Normale in Besançon. Marriage and family After a year of teaching and a year of military service, in 1903, Pergaud married his first wife. They lived in Durnes, where he was teaching again. After moving to Landresse for a time, Pergaud separated from his wife in 1907 and moved to Paris. They later divorced and he married a second time. Career Louis Pergaud accepted his first teaching position in Durnes. After a year, he was called to complete a year of military service with the 35th infantry regiment stationed in Belfort. According to Ian Higgins, \\"National service in 1902-03 did nothing to cure him of his anti-militarism.\\" Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 283. In the fall of 1903, Pergaud returned to his post in Durne. In 1905 Pergaud transferred with his wife to Landresse. Initially, life in this small, isolated village was difficult. According to Ian Higgins, \\"The predominantly Catholic villagers of Landresse were hostile to their local teacher, by definition a servant of the Republic, and who never went to Mass. Feeling cut off in an alien environment, tired of constantly battling against suspicion, ill-feeling, innuendo, and accusation, Pergaud resigned his post and went to Paris to work in an office.\\" Tim Cross (1988), The Lost Voices of World War I, page 283. In 1907, Pergaud left Landresse and his wife, for Paris, where he joined Leon Deubel, a longtime friend and inspiration. In Paris, Pergaud suffered through extreme poverty, even as he worked as a clerk and then as a schoolteacher, in an effort to realize his dream of literary success. Works His earliest works were collections of poetry that were published at his own expense through a literary review called Le Beffroi. The first collection, entitled L'Aube, appeared in 1904. The second, L'Herbe d'Avril, was published in 1908. In 1910 Mercure de France published a collection of Pergaud's short stories under the title De Goupil à Margot. This work was awarded the prestigious Prix Goncourt, which led to some national recognition. A second collection of short stories about animals, La Revanche du corbeau appeared in 1911. His novel, La Guerre des boutons, described below, was published in 1912. In 1913 Pergaud published the novel, Le Roman de Miraut, in which an animal had the leading role. He wrote numerous other short stories about the people and animals of his native Franche-Comté, which would be published posthumously. In 1912 La Guerre des boutons was published, a tale of a play-war between the small boys of two neighbouring villages. Those \\"killed\\" would have their buttons removed as trophies before being sent home. The novel begins humorously, but becomes more sinister as the distinctions between play and real violence among the boys become blurred. It has been described as having a \\"touch of Lord of the Flies\\" in tone, although the book substantially pre-dates that novel by William Golding. Pergaud's works remain popular in France; La Guerre des boutons has been reprinted more than thirty times. It is included in the French high school curriculum for literature. World War I Pergaud had tried to register as a pacifist, but he was conscripted into the French Army at the outbreak of the First World War. He had been placed in the active reserve following his national service twelve years before. In this capacity he served in the Battle of Lorraine during the German invasion of France, and subsequently on the Western Front. On 7 April 1915, Pergaud's regiment attacked the Imperial German Army's trenches near Fresnes-en-Woëvre, during which Pergaud was shot and wounded. He fell into barbed wire, where he became trapped. Some hours later, German soldiers rescued him and other wounded, taking the French soldiers to a temporary field hospital behind German lines. On the morning of 8 April, Pergaud and other POWs were killed by friendly fire from a French artillery barrage that destroyed the hospital.  Adaptations of his works  La Guerre des boutons has been developed as a film five times: * La Guerre des Gosses (1936, France) by Jacques Daroy * La Guerre des Boutons (1962, France), black-and-white, directed by Yves Robert.

The report was conducted by U.S. Commissioner James H. Blount, appointed by U.S. President Grover Cleveland to investigate the events surrounding the January 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. The Blount Report \\"first provided evidence that officially identified the United States' complicity in the lawless overthrow of the lawful, peaceful government of Hawaii.\\"Ball, Milner S. \\"Symposium: Native American Law,\\" Georgia Law Review 28 (1979): 303 Blount concluded that U.S. Minister to Hawaii John L. Stevens had carried out unauthorized partisan activities, including the landing of U.S. Marines under a false or exaggerated pretext, to support the anti-royalist conspirators; that these actions were instrumental to the success of the revolution; and that the revolution was carried out against the wishes of a majority of the population of Hawaii.Tate, Merze. (1965). The United States and the Hawaiian Kingdom: A Political History. New Haven and London: Yale University Press. p. 235. The Blount Report was followed in 1894 by the Morgan Report, which contradicted Blount's report by concluding that all participants except for Queen Liliuokalani were \\"not guilty\\". Background In January 1893, Queen Liliuokalani of Hawaiʻi threatened to replace the \\"Bayonet Constitution\\" that had been forced upon the monarchy in 1887 with a new constitution that would restore power to the throne. American and European resident merchants operating as the Committee of Public Safety responded by forcing Liliuokalani from power and proclaiming a provisional government. During the overthrow, the American Minister to Hawaii John L. Stevens ordered the landing of U.S. Marines from the in Honolulu, ostensibly to protect lives and property. After the Hawaiian monarchy was overthrown, the Provisional Government of Hawaii immediately sent a treaty of annexation to the expansionist President Benjamin Harrison, who referred it favorably to the Senate for ratification on February 15, 1893. When Grover Cleveland, an anti-expansionist, became President less than three weeks later, he withdrew the treaty from the Senate and appointed former Representative James Henderson Blount as special representative to investigate the events surrounding the overthrow. Investigation As special envoy to Hawaii with paramount powers to investigate the circumstances of the revolution and the stability of the Provisional Government, Blount made himself accessible. He obtained testimony from interviews, letters, affidavits, and other documents, including the \\"Statement of the Hawaiian Patriotic League\\" and \\"Memorial on the Hawaiian Crises\\", but did not have subpoena power. However, one historian has noted that Blount did not interview members of the Committee of Safety, and some questions may have been slanted to build a case for restoration of the queen. Blount delivered his report to President Cleveland on July 17, 1893 claiming improper U.S. backing for the overthrow had been responsible for its success, and concluded that the Provisional Government lacked popular support. On the basis of Blount's report, President Cleveland dismissed Stevens and began to secretly work towards the restoration of Liliuokalani and the constitutional monarchy, conditional upon amnesty to those responsible for the overthrow. The new Minister to Hawaii Albert Willis was unable to persuade the Queen to grant amnesty to the Committee of Public Safety, in return for the throne until December 18. Following this, Willis, acting on behalf of Cleveland, ordered provisional government President Sanford Dole to dissolve his government and restore the Queen. In a letter, Dole vehemently refused Cleveland's demand. The same day, President Cleveland delivered a message to Congress declaring the overthrow improper, calling it \\"an act of war, committed with the participation of a diplomatic representative of the United States and without authority of Congress.\\"Overthrow of Hawaii Resolution, Pub.L.

No. > 47, 53rd Cong., 2d Sess., XIII–XV (1893) Response Liliuokalani's delay in accepting the terms of her restoration and Dole's flat refusal made Cleveland turn over the matter to the Senate. The Senate authorized the Morgan Report which conducted two months of hearings taken from witnesses under oath and carried out under cross examination. The Morgan Report contradicted Blount's conclusions and exonerated the military and Stevens from blame. Senator George Gray of Delaware, Cleveland's chief spokesperson on the subcommittee, said Morgan examined witnesses \\"in a very partial and unfair way... to aid the annexationists and injure the President.\\".\\" Walter Q. Gresham, Cleveland's Secretary of State, said that Morgan was \\"insincere and meant mischief.\\" Historian R.S. Kuykendall wrote that \\"nevertheless, the Morgan hearings did commit to the record the testimony of many participants in the revolution who had been neglected by Blount.\\" Morgan, a Democrat like Cleveland but sympathetic with the expansionist Republicans, seemed to have a vested interest in exonerating both Stevens' actions during the Hawaiian Revolution, as well as Blount's appointment by Cleveland without Congressional approval. Historian W.A. Russ noted, \\"It seems that the Chairman had two purposes in mind: first, to gainsay everything the Blount Report had asserted; second, to clear the name of every American official and to give the United States a spotless slate.\\" Cleveland left office and was replaced by pro-annexation President William McKinley in 1897. Hawaii was annexed to the United States the following year. Modern relevance In 1993, Congress passed and the President signed an Apology Resolution apologizing for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii a century before. Based on the Blount Report, other historical analyses, and the claims of Hawaiian sovereignty activists, the Resolution subsequently became a touchstone in the cultural identification of Hawaiians, as well as for the growing Hawaiian sovereignty movement who seek self-government similar to that of Native Americans and Alaskan peoples.

It flows from an unnamed pond north of Chappaqua to Getty Square in Yonkers, where it empties into the Hudson as that river's southernmost tributary. It is the only major stream in southern Westchester County to drain into the Hudson instead of Long Island Sound. It drains an area of , most of it heavily developed suburbia. For , it flows parallel to the Saw Mill River Parkway, a commuter artery, an association that has been said to give the river an \\"identity crisis.\\" The watershed was settled by the Dutch in the 17th century and was the site of Philipse Manor Hall, seat of Philipsburg Manor. The land was owned by Frederick Philipse I and subsequent generations until the family lost it at the end of the American Revolution. The land along the river was later divided into multiple towns. Industry in Yonkers developed along the Saw Mill, so polluting the river by the end of the 19th century that a local poet called it a \\"snake-like yellow scrawl of scum\\". In the 1920s, the last half-mile (800 m) of the stream was routed into tunnels and culverts under downtown Yonkers, a process partially reversed in the early 21st century when it became the first major New York waterway to be daylighted. Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rates the river's last as an impaired water body. Plastics are commonly found along the riverbank, and metals from industrial factories are found in the water in high concentrations. Nonetheless, the river is home to species such as the American eel (Anguilla rostrata) , which swim upstream to mature and swim back into the Hudson and the ocean in order to breed. Course alt=A narrow, partially dry creek runs between two plant-covered banks in a forest The Saw Mill River rises from a pond in a wooded area of the town of New Castle roughly north of Chappaqua, a west of Quaker Road State Route 120 (NY 120) and just south of Stony Hollow Road, at an elevation of above sea level. It wends and meanders past a cemetery, between hills, through a residential area of houses on large wooded lots in a generally southward direction. Just north of Marcourt Drive, its first crossing, it is impounded to create another small pond. In this area it is frequently channelized and impounded as part of the landscaping on the area's large residential land lots. After crossing under Kipp Street, it bends eastward to cross under Quaker Road. A short channelized portion runs through the front yard of a large house on Quaker southeast of the intersection, after which the river flows back under Quaker and behind the houses on the west side into another impoundment, Chappaqua's Duck Pond. From its outlet it continues southeast between Quaker on its east and Douglas and Mill River roads on the west to the Saw Mill River Parkway. Just west of the Chappaqua train station, it turns southwest to parallel both the parkway and Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line as both cross into the town of Mount Pleasant. At this point the river is at in elevation, a loss of from its source. Just south of the town line, it receives Tertia Brook, its first named tributary, from the east. alt=A wooden bridge over a small dam over which water falls into a stream flowing out of the picture at lower left. Behind it is a large, still pond; to the left a black sport-utility vehicle is parked A mile past the town line, the river and its eponymous parkway pass the village of Pleasantville to the east. There the river crosses under the parkway to flow on its west, then crosses and recrosses at the Pleasantville Road (State Route 117) exit. Both make a long turn to the southeast and then back to the southwest around Graham Hills County Park, where it receives Nanny Hagen Brook from the east, before crossing back to the parkway's west in the flood plain around the base of the hills as road, river and rail pass the unincorporated hamlets of Thornwood, and Hawthorne, where the Harlem Line turns to the south. Just east of the Taconic State Parkway, the river again crosses under the Saw Mill Parkway, then the Taconic. Shortly after that exit it crosses under Saw Mill River Road (State Routes 9A and 100) and some ramps to them from the interchange, then under the Saw Mill Parkway. Both turn south again, then southeast, following the eastern edge of the Pocantico Hills, joined on the west by the North County Trailway bike path, on the right-of-way of the former New York and Putnam Railroad, known as the \\"Old Put\\". The river crosses under the parkway again to form the eastern edge of a plant nursery on Saw Mill River Road, then recrosses as the river, bike path, parkway and Saw Mill River Road all bend around the northwest corner of Eastview, where the Saw Mill drops below in elevation, a loss of since Chappaqua. A turn back to the southwest around Tarrytown Lakes County Park puts the river at the outskirts of Elmsford. There it receives Mine Brook from the east. Woodlands Lake in Greenburgh Here the bike path ends amidst the dense urban development, but the parkway continues, and the two again draw close as they enter the town of Greenburgh and intersect the Cross Westchester Expressway (Interstate 287). A new bike path, the South County Trailway, begins here just south of the West Main Street (State Route 119) bridge north of the Rum Brook confluence. Past that the parkway, trailway and the Saw Mill River all turn southwest, where they intersect the New York State Thruway (Interstate 87) at an oblique angle. For the next mile the Thruway remains close to the river, and Saw Mill River Road, now just carrying NY 9A, returns to the corridor just east of the Thruway as well. The river then runs along the west of V. Everit Macy Park. As part of the park facilities, the Saw Mill River is impounded into Woodlands Lake, the largest impoundment on the Saw Mill River, used as a water supply by the local communities of Ardsley and Dobbs Ferry, whose northern village line is just to the south. The river runs close to the boundary between the two, as the Thruway gradually veers away to the southeast just past the Ashford Avenue bridge. Newly daylighted Saw Mill River in Van Der Donck Park, Yonkers Continuing south-southwest, the river along with the parkway and trailway enter Hastings-on-Hudson, its greenbelt the only major break in the village's dense suburban development. It slowly veers toward a more southerly heading, and enters the Nepera Park neighborhood of Yonkers after , just south of Farragut Parkway. Once in the neighborhood, the Saw Mill River flows through a Yonkers sewage treatment plant, the other impoundment of the river. After leaving the plant, to the south of where the river entered Yonkers, the parkway and trailway diverge from the river after , to climb over the watershed divide to Tibbetts Brook. Saw Mill River Road continues to parallel its namesake. Bending to the southwest again, the Saw Mill flows in a narrow channel through an industrial and commercial area. A mile south of the parkway, it flows through the middle of the former Smith Carpet Mills site, where it finally drops to in elevation. After crossing Ashburton Avenue, the river bends around to flow briefly to the northwest under Nepperhan Avenue after crossing the Old Croton Aqueduct. It circles around War Memorial Field, giving up its remaining elevation as the Hudson River nears. The Saw Mill River turns south again past the park. After passing the towers of a large housing project to its west, it is routed into a tunnel at Chicken Island, the triangle between Nepperhan and Palisade avenues and School Street. At Van der Donck Park in downtown Yonkers, it resurfaces as it flows past the post office. For its final hundred feet (30 m), it re-enters a tunnel under the train station and the tracks of the Hudson Line, after which culverts empty it into the Hudson south of Dock Street. Watershed The Saw Mill's watershed is limited by the hilly topography of central Westchester County to a valley that averages wide; the only wider spots are the Mine Brook and Tarrytown Lakes subwatersheds and the river's mouth in downtown Yonkers. The highest elevation in the watershed is , reached in two locations: the summit of Sarles Hill north of Pleasantville, and an unnamed height of land about southwest of Buttermilk Hill, west of Hawthorne. From source to mouth, 10% of the watershed is in New Castle, 42% in the town of Mount Pleasant, 33% in Greenburgh, and 14% in Yonkers. 63% of the watershed consists of dense urban or less dense suburban land development, 34% forest, and 1% agricultural. The woodlands buffering the river and the South County Trailway is one of the few significant areas of open space in the county south of I-287. Some 110,000 people live in the Saw Mill River's watershed, in communities varying from small villages to Yonkers, New York's fourth-largest city. This is 12% of the county's total, on 6% of its area. The watershed's population density varies from 1,000 per square mile around the headwaters at Chappaqua to 10,000 around the mouth. It averages to 4,151 per square mile, twice that of the county and ten times the density for the state. On the north, the Saw Mill watershed is bordered by the watersheds of Gedney Brook and the Kisco River, both of which drain into New Croton Reservoir on the Croton River, one of several large reservoirs in that watershed that are part of New York City's water supply system. On the northeast, the adjacent watersheds drain into Kensico Reservoir, another that supplies the city. Moving south, the next watersheds are tributaries of the Bronx River, then Yonkers' Grassy Sprain Reservoir and finally Tibbetts Brook. To its west in the narrow strip between the Saw Mill and the Hudson are the Pocantico River and Sheldon Brook watersheds at the north end of the watershed, and those of unnamed shorter streams at the south. History Pre-colonial The Saw Mill River, then known as the Nepperhan River, acted as a boundary between the Manhattan Indians and the Weckquaesgeeks, members of the Algonquian family who fished the region's streams and lakes with rods and nets. The Manhattans occupied present-day New York City north to the river, while the Weckquaesgeeks occupied the land from the river north to the Pocantico River. The Manhattans' principal village, Nepperamack, was on the site of present-day Yonkers where the Saw Mill River discharges into the Hudson River. The Weckquaesgeeks settled the site of today's Dobbs Ferry, and on the river's banks west of White Plains. Colonial period The Saw Mill River flowing past Philipse Manor Hall into the Hudson River, c. 1784 In 1639, the Dutch West India Company acquired from the Manhattans the area that would become Yonkers. Seven years later, Dutch settler Adriaen van der Donck was granted part of this land, including the southern section of what he named the Saeck-kill, today's Saw Mill River. His estate was called Colen Donck, for \\"Donck's colony\\". He built a sawmill and a gristmill on the Saeck-kill. After his death, his widow gradually sold the land. In the 1670s, part of Donck's land passed to Frederick Philipse, who was rewarded with , including the lower river, for declaring his loyalty to the new British rulers of New Netherlands. Philipse named the manor Philipsborough and ran it as a quasi-feudal farm, hiring tenants to work the land. Around 1682, he built Philipse Manor Hall, a mansion along the Saw Mill River that is today a National Historic Landmark. When Philipse died around 1702, the manor was divided between his son Adolph and grandson Frederick II. In 1750, his great-grandson Frederick III inherited the whole property and moved from his New York City townhouse to the manor hall, previously used as the family's summer home. Frederick sat in the Colonial Assembly, where he was a strong supporter of the British government that had given his family everything it owned, but he was primarily interested in managing the land. He improved the manor hall and worked to attract tenant farmers to the land. The family was known for its relaxed approach to its tenants, and the farm was very profitable. Commercially navigable only at its mouth, the Saw Mill River itself was useless as a way to bring crops to market, limiting settlement further upriver. Nevertheless, the roots of present-day communities along the river were established during the colonial era. In 1695, a land agent named Isaac See settled at the north bound of Philipse Manor, in the flat land between a bend in the river. Other farmers came to the area, and the settlement ultimately became today's village of Pleasantville. By 1704, the area that is today Elmsford, New York was known as Storm's Bridge, after Abraham Storm, who established a tavern at the junction of the Saw Mill River and Tarrytown roads (today routes 9A and 119) that is the center of that village today. In 1719, one of the Philipse tenant farmers, William Hammond, built his house on land he leased in what is today Eastview, where his house still stands. Along the river to the north, his brother Staats Hammond built two mills along the river; the small settlement of Hammond's Mill became today's Hawthorne. Other settlers came to the Saw Mill River's headwaters from a different direction. Quakers had been immigrating to Long Island since the previous century to escape religious persecution in England; in the 1700s, \\"Shapequaw\\", north of the present hamlet of Chappaqua, was established. In the middle of the century, the community built its meeting house; it and other buildings of the era are today part of the Old Chappaqua Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Revolutionary War As tensions rose between the colonists and Britain in the early 1770s, Philipse remained loyal to the crown. He was arrested in August 1776 and held in Connecticut until a parole grant at the end of the year allowed him to return home as long as he did nothing to support the British war effort. He broke that promise the next spring: he attempted, perhaps at the behest of his wife, to inform the British that a passing column of Continental Army troops was headed south to attack a British camp at Morrisania, now in the Bronx. Shortly afterwards he fled to British-occupied New York; he would never return to his home along the Saw Mill. alt=An old postcard showing a large green earthen dam with a small stream flowing in front. There are bare trees in front and houses on a hillside in the background Communities along the Saw Mill played minor parts in the Revolutionary War, especially after the Battle of White Plains in October 1776. The defeated Continentals retreated to the vicinity of Peekskill while the victorious British withdrew to Kingsbridge in what is now the Bronx. Neither side wanted to cede control of the Hudson Valley, which divided New England from the other colonies. This left most of Westchester unoccupied neutral ground. However, Westchester was not demilitarized. Local militias and raiding parties affiliated with both sides fought each other and terrorized the other's sympathizers and supporters. Many residents of southern Westchester abandoned their farms and drove their herds up the valley to Buttermilk Hill to protect them from Loyalist raids. The Continentals built forts near Hawthorne, where a minor tributary named Flykill Creek drained into the Saw Mill (roughly at the junction of today's Saw Mill and Taconic parkways), and built Yankee Dam to create a lake wide enough to slow any British progress up the river. At Chappaqua, the pacifist Quakers opened their meetinghouse as a hospital for injured Continental Army soldiers. Storm's tavern was a gathering place for Continental officers and, later, their French colleagues. As one of the few routes into hilly central Westchester, the river and its associated roads saw frequent skirmishes. In November 1777, three young men with Patriot sympathies were walking near the river crossing on the Dobbs Ferry Road (now Ashford Avenue) when they came upon a group of horsemen affiliated with Kipp's Regiment, one of the county's most-feared Loyalist militias. The young men taunted their rivals, who beat them so severely that two later died. The survivor was awarded a pension, believed to be the first in U.S. history, by the Continental Congress. Later that month, Emmerich's Chasseurs, an elite unit of Loyalist militia and Hessian mercenaries, staged a midnight raid on Storm's Bridge. Hoping to capture Storm and his cousins the Van Tassels, all active in the local Patriot militia, the Chasseurs settled for burning and looting Storm's house and tavern. Proceeding on to the Van Tassel houses, they trapped Cornelius Van Tassel Jr., one of the cousins' teenage sons. As the Chasseurs set fire to the houses, he hid on a roof, then jumped off, fended off some putative captors, and fled into the cold waters of the nearby Saw Mill. He got away, but soon died of hypothermia. The Saw Mill River and its adjacent terrain conferred some tactical advantages to those who knew it. One skirmish began when a Patriot militiaman, Jake Acker, was hunting in a bushy area of the eastern flood plain at Elmsford. Spying a large group of British soldiers and Loyalist supporters on the road to Storm's tavern, Acker began sniping at them from his concealment. He fatally wounded one, changed his position amid the distraction, reloaded his musket, and killed another. Hearing the shots, other local Patriots came to Acker's aid, and eventually all but one of the larger force were killed or captured. Some senior Continental Army officers spent time in the Saw Mill River valley. George Washington is said to have mentioned the \\"ford over the Nepperhan at the elm tree\\", referring to a wide tree no longer extant; a century later, residents named their hamlet after the remark, \\"Elmsford\\". He left a meeting at the Hammond House in Eastview moments before Loyalists converged on it; his host, Col. James Hammond, the commander of the Westchester militia, was captured and imprisoned for the rest of the war. On the British side, Major John André spent his last night before his capture, with documents exposing Benedict Arnold's betrayal, at the Rookery inn in Hawthorne. Later in the war, Young's farmhouse and Four Corners were the site of the largest military engagement near the river. By 1780, the Continentals were operating much more freely around northern Westchester, although they had to stay on the move to avoid attack. In January, one company of about 250 troops from Massachusetts lingered long enough at Four Corners for local Loyalists to inform the British, who raised a force of about 100 cavalry and 400 to 500 infantry at Fort Washington, today on the northern tip of Manhattan. The force marched to Yonkers and up the Saw Mill overnight, arriving at Four Corners the next morning. The outnumbered Continentals put up stiff resistance, aided by the cold, heavy snow cover and their opponents' fatigue, but most were ultimately killed or taken prisoner. The British and their Loyalist and Hessian allies celebrated by burning down the Young house; the Continentals retreated to the north of the Croton River for the rest of the war. alt=Frederick Philipse III, last lord of Philipsburg Manor In 1779, the New York State Legislature passed a bill of attainder confiscating the property of British officials and prominent Loyalists, Philipse included. The land, including land in the Saw Mill River watershed, was then distributed to the tenant farmers. In 1788, the state divided into three the town of Greenburgh, in which the entire eastern half of the tract had been located. The towns of Yonkers and Mount Pleasant joined Greenburgh, all approximately within their present boundaries. In 1790, a group of settlers organized the Greenburgh Presbyterian Church, and three years later built a church at Storm's Bridge. (Today, it is the National Register-listed Elmsford Reformed Church, the oldest building in the village, the oldest church in continuous use in Westchester County.) 1800s and 1900s Most of Yonkers' economy in the early 19th century was derived from the Saw Mill River. As of 1813, there was a small wharf slightly upstream from the mouth where the sloops that carried river trade put in. Five small mills existed along the river above the village, all with their own dams, small mill ponds, and nearby tenements for the workers. The stagecoach route up the Post Road stopped at an inn near the bridge; a few stores existed to supply the workers there and at the mills. Some pastures and orchards existed, but the rocky soil deterred most attempts at farming. (A historian later wrote that it was said at the time that \\"the succession of boulders was so continuous that one might have stepped from Getty Square to the present Glenwood without setting his foot upon the ground\\".) Between the rocky soil and Wells' general refusal to sell or lease most of his land, there were so few settlers in Yonkers that two schoolhouses built during the Revolution fell into severe neglect due to the lack of students. The manor house and the surrounding land at the river's mouth that is today downtown passed through several owners until 1813, when New York merchant Lemuel Wells bought the around the manor house. Wells neither subdivided nor developed the property, although he did extensively landscape the manor house grounds. In 1831, Wells built a long wharf into the Hudson just above the mouth of the Saw Mill for the steamboat service which had been established between New York and Albany. Otherwise, the property remained largely unchanged until his death in 1842. alt=An old map in black and white showing a smaller river meandering into the Hudson River, along the bottom, with a collection of buildings indicated near the confluence. At the top right is printed \\"Estate of Lemuel Wells, Purchased in 1813 Maps of the property from the time of Wells' purchase and his death show the Saw Mill's mouth widening into a small estuary before reaching the Hudson. The south bank of the river at the mouth had a bluff. The only construction directly affecting the river was the bridge that carried the Albany Post Road, today Riverdale and Warburton avenues, part of U.S. Route 9 and Route 9A, over the river. Wells had survived the death of his first wife and all four of his brothers; he also had no children, leaving him without a clear heir. His estate was further complicated by his lack of a will. Accordingly, under New York law at the time, his holdings were divided among his widow, fifteen nephews and one grand nephew. They decided to subdivide and sell the property, and within a few years more buildings had gone up, just in time for the construction of the Hudson River Railroad in 1848, which laid its track on a causeway right across the river's mouth. Over the next several decades, as Yonkers' population grew rapidly, leading it to incorporate as a village and then, in 1872, a city, the rest of the estuary was filled in and narrowed and the bluffs on its south side graded out of existence. By the later decades of the 19th century, industry had grown up along the river's lower portion. So much pollution was dumped into the river from the factories alongside it that a local poet lamented the Saw Mill's decline in an 1891 quatrain: To let the river replenish itself, most of the dams that had been built were removed in 1893. Ten years later it had somewhat recovered, and people were again using it for drinking water and swimming. In the late 19th century, the New York and Putnam Railroad was built along the Saw Mill River from Putnam County to central Yonkers, and thence to Tibbets Creek and the Harlem River. Various parts of the line operated until the 1940s and the 1980s. The main line of the railroad is now devoted to bicycle and pedestrian paths. They are the South County Trailway on the parts south of Route 119, and the North County Trailway north of 119 in Elmsford. To slake the thirst of its ever-growing population, which had reached almost 100,000 by 1915, Yonkers tapped the Saw Mill. Water from an impoundment north of downtown was held in two reservoirs and two water towers. It was purified by slow filtration through sand and then chlorinated. By 1919 the city was drawing an average of 10.6 million gallons () a day from the river through this system. Despite this, the pollution of the river continued unabated, reversing its earlier recovery. In a 1920 report on the condition of public water supplies around the state, New York's Health Department said \\"sanitary conditions upon the Saw Mill watershed are very unsatisfactory\\", despite the considerable rules and regulations it had promulgated to protect the river in Yonkers. The city's own public works department had noted dozens of violations for the previous year, most of them continued from the years before that. \\"A great many privies and cesspools are located on the edge of the Saw Mill and its tributaries and there is also drainage from poultry yards, barnyards and house drains,\\" the department noted Rather than enforce the violated regulations more strictly and clean up the river, the city chose to cover it up entirely. Between 1917 and 1922, the last of river, including a small gorge, was buried in a flume under the Getty Square neighborhood, an effort to halt the river's frequent floods and quarantine its unsanitary water, and open up some space for further development. That same decade, the county parks commission proposed the Saw Mill River Parkway along the river, just as the 1922 Bronx River Parkway follows the Bronx River, and to add a sewer line along the river to prevent contamination of Yonkers' water supply. Construction began in 1929 and continued throughout the Great Depression. By 1940, the parkway had reached the river's headwaters at Chappaqua, where World War II temporarily halted construction. In 1954, it was complete. The parkway's construction, along with that of the New York State Thruway later in the decade, required some adjustment of the river's course in some areas. Westchester's postwar development led to more stormwater runoff, which often flooded and closed the parkway. By 1958, engineers were urging that the river be cleaned up to reduce flooding. Still, illegal dumping and overflows continued. For example, storm runoff gave the Yonkers section the river's highest concentrations of heavy metals, PCBs, and other chemicals, according to a study of the river in 1983, the year the city stopped using the Saw Mill as its primary water source. A decade later, the sediment in the Saw Mill had the highest concentration of metals in the United States Geological Survey's entire water-quality assessment program. 2000s A new kind of pollution entered the lower Saw Mill in 2003 when a Yonkers sugar refinery spilled hydrochloric acid into the river. Westchester District Attorney Jeanine Pirro brought criminal environmental charges against American Sugar Refining, the plant owner, which was forced to pay a $20,000 fine; make a $100,000 donation to Riverkeeper, a regional environmental organization that focuses on the Hudson and its tributaries; and give of sugar to Westchester Food-PATCH, a local nonprofit that supplies food to other nonprofits. Riverkeeper passed the money it received along to the Saw Mill River Coalition for local projects in Yonkers. In 2008, Groundwork Hudson Valley, the coordinator of the Saw Mill River Coalition, received a three-year, $889,183 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Targeted Watershed Grant. One of 15 recipients from a nationwide pool of more than 100 applicants, the group cleans up garbage, removes invasive species, and plants native trees along the river. The group also marks storm drains that drain to the river. On September 25–26, 2009, the Saw Mill River Coalition organized a BioBlitz to catalog species of plant life, animal life, insects, fungi, and bacteria in the river and its watershed. The Coalition is also looking to restore the wetlands along the river in order to reduce flooding. Raising of the Saw Mill Parkway continues; in 2013, a stretch in Pleasantville was raised by three inches to reduce flooding from the river. Daylighting 2011 daylighting construction Daylighted The city of Yonkers carried out a $48 million daylighting project in the 2010s to remove the flume that the river flows through under Yonkers and bring the river to the surface. The project uncovered the river for six blocks in Downtown Yonkers. The newly surfaced river is the centerpiece of an urban park in Getty Square, Downtown Yonkers. The first phase of the project removed a parking lot that covered a two-block section of the river in the Getty Square neighborhood of downtown Yonkers. Ground was broken on December 15, 2010, and the work was completed in December 2011. Work on the second phase, to expose the river in the Mill Street Courtyard, began on March 19, 2014 and was completed by August 2016. The project stimulated real estate investment in the area. Recreation The river affords some of the few remaining open spaces in Westchester County. Near Ardsley and Dobbs Ferry and Irvington, the river passes through V. Everit Macy Park, popular for picnicking and fishing in Woodlands Lake. Butternut Ridge Park contains the Tarrytown Lakes reservoirs and a hiking trail. Two bicycle trails run along parts of the river: the North County Trailway and the South County Trailway, which run from Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx to Putnam County. The Saw Mill was also known as the closest trout fishing river to New York City. In the early 2000s, it was stocked with a few hundred trout each year. The lower river specifically is a good trout river. Hydrology The USGS maintains a stream gauge on the Saw Mill just above the river's mouth in Yonkers. Mean discharge since 1944 has been per second, with extremes of during the April 2007 nor'easter and . Average annual precipitation in the watershed is . alt=A blue and green circular medallion on a sewer warning that the discharge goes into the river The Saw Mill River's water quality varies, reflecting its history and surroundings. Its headwaters in the town of New Castle are considered \\"relatively healthy\\". There the river is less disturbed, and its ecosystem supports a diversity of organisms. In Yonkers, where it flows through a concrete-lined channel, there is less life in the water and it is considered to be environmentally impaired. A 1983 United States Geological Survey (USGS) study found that concentrations of heavy metals in the water increased further downstream, a phenomenon observed with many other pollutants in the river and correlated with the urbanization around and above its mouth. DDT was detected in the streambed sediments throughout the river. In its final , more than 50 micrograms of PCBs were found per kilogram of water. In the 1990s, the USGS found that of the 35 Hudson tributaries it tested, the Saw Mill had the worst levels of cadmium, copper, mercury, nickel and zinc in the sediments near its mouth, and among the worst nationwide (however, only the river's manganese levels were found to exceed federal standards). It is believed to add more pollution to the Hudson than any other single tributary. Unusually for a river, the Saw Mill's waters have consistently had a slightly alkaline pH, suggesting it has not been as affected by acid rain as other Hudson tributaries. In 1951, a state Department of Health survey reported pH between 7.25 and 9.1. Four decades later, another study found pH readings rising steadily from 7.59 in Chappaqua to 8.24 in Yonkers. Similarly, a 2007 Manhattan College study done for the New York State Water Resources Institute found a median low of 7.36 in Chappaqua and a median high of 7.81 near Torre Road in Yonkers, with a drop to 7.67 at the tunnel, for a total median for the river of 7.59. The lowest recorded pH in the year- long study was 7.1 at Chappaqua with the highest reading, 8.17, at Torre Road. All results were between 6.5 and 8.5, the range required by state regulations. The 1983 USGS study also classified the water quality of the entire river. The first from the river's source in Chappaqua was classified as suitable for any purpose besides drinking. The next was classified as being safe to drink. The last of the river from the sewage treatment plant to the Hudson was determined to be unsafe to drink, bathe in or fish in. The water was only safe for agricultural and industrial use. Saw Mill River Parkway flooded after alt=A divided highway with a metal guardrail in the middle completely covered in brown water during a rainstorm In regulations adopted in 1985 and amended in 2008, New York's Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) divides the river into four water-quality regions similar to those in the 1983 USGS study. The first from the Saw Mill's mouth is affected by the Hudson's tides and thus is often salty like the river at that point. It is considered Saline Class B surface water, to be kept suitable for primary and secondary contact recreation such as swimming, boating and fishing, and capable of supporting \\"fish, shellfish and wildlife propagation and survival.\\" The next section extends to the tailwater at the Yonkers sewage plant impoundment, and is Class C fresh water, with the same purposes, to the extent that \\"other factors\\" do not limit them. From there to the Woodlands Lake inlet is the third section, designated as Class A fresh water, to be kept clean enough for drinking. The remainder to the source is the fourth section, designated Class B, or fresh water kept to the same standards as the salt water above the river's mouth. Tributaries, named and unnamed, and subtributaries are generally held to the same standards as the section into which they drain. A 1991 study by Irene Gruenfeld, a Williams College undergraduate, measured various pollutants at eight points along the river, from just below the duck pond in Chappaqua to inside the tunnel in Yonkers. The levels increased as the river flowed along, suggesting that most pollutants, especially dissolved salts, came from urban runoff instead of any single point source. The exception was PCBs, which rose drastically south of Elmsford (a finding that concurred with an earlier study) and then doubled in Yonkers. The study noted that this suggested a point source, perhaps a known burial site for used capacitors in the Elmsford area, yet Gruenfeld argued that cleaning up this and other possible point sources would not eliminate PCBs in the river. While the PCBs in the river were found somewhat biodegraded, chlordane levels are high enough that DEC recommends eating no more than a half-pound () of fish or eel from the Saw Mill per month. A 2004-05 EPA study of the river rated the water quality 6 out of 100. The study also discovered that dissolved oxygen levels in the water were low because there were few organisms, poor sediment, and little plant life in the river. Although storm water from residential neighborhoods added dissolved oxygen, it also brought ammonia from fertilizer. The Army Corps of Engineers found that the channeling prevented aquatic life from sustaining itself; few fish naturally spawn in the river because of the cement casing and flume at its mouth. Two years later, a joint study by Manhattan College and the New York State Water Resources Institute found high levels of human fecal bacteria in the water, likely due to municipal wastewater. All 12 sites exceeded the state maximum of a monthly median of 200 organisms per 100 milliliters (ml) over five months. Levels were, as with most of the river's other pollutants, generally the highest near the mouth. However, the uppermost sampling site in the study, at the Chappaqua Metro-North station recorded the greatest single reading of any site, 1.2 × 10 organisms per 100 ml, as well as the second- highest; the researchers speculated that this was due to sewer overflow in the area at the times of those readings. Most of the high coliform readings came after rainfall except at the two sites furthest downstream; the study theorized that some older buildings in this area of Yonkers may still discharge sewage directly to the river. Since most of the Saw Mill River flows under the shade of a forest canopy, the bacteria may be less likely to be inactivated by sunlight than in other streams. The riverbanks in Yonkers are often lined with tires, shopping carts, plastic bottles, and other trash. In 2008, DEC found trash and pollution from the river's mouth to the end of the tunnel. \\"Urban refuse (tires, bottles, cans, etc.) lines much of the lower river,\\" it reported. \\"Oil/gasoline slicks are regularly observed along this segment.\\" The stretches further upriver were slightly better. Between the end of the tunnel and Woodlands Lake, the river was still found to be impaired for recreation, drinking and aquatic life, but less strewn with litter, and as a whole the habitat was merely stressed. Above that point, the Saw Mill's waters were merely stressed for aquatic life and recreation, with only fish consumption considered to be impaired. DEC did not know the sources of pollutants in this stretch and called for further research.\\" Geology The Saw Mill's basin is part of the Manhattan Hills in the New England Uplands physiographic region. It is primarily underlain by metamorphic rock such as gneiss, schist and marble. They can be seen in some bedrock outcrops in and around the river. Soils in the river and its basin reflect past glaciation in the area. Glacial till covers much of the river bottom in its headwaters. Further downstream there is stratified drift and alluvium in the sediments. Flora and fauna Juvenile American eels The American eel lives in the Saw Mill River and its tributaries. Commonly born in the Atlantic Ocean, the eels maneuver through the river's tunnel under Yonkers before reaching the more natural parts of the river farther upstream. The eels also scale a dam before reaching Woodlands Lake. Growing up to in length upstream, the eels return to the ocean via the Hudson River to spawn. The planned installation of trash- catching nets along the daylighted portion of the river would prevent the eels from leaving the river to reproduce. Purple Loosestrife More fish have been discovered in the newly daylighted section of the river. Baby eastern blacknose dace and tessellated darter have been spotted in the river in addition to trout. In addition, wood frogs, eastern painted turtles, and redbreast sunfish live in the river too. All of these species have been hurt by the industrialization of the river. About 10 to 20 white-tailed deer per square mile (2.6 to 5.2 deer per square kilometer) live along the river and the parkway, more than the ecosystem can carry. They eat low-lying plants, shrubs, and tree saplings, reducing the food supply for smaller animals. The deer also collide with cars—in Hastings, about 1.6 times per month. Beavers can also be found along the river, building small dams along the river. Night herons, ducks, and other birds are also present along the river. Numerous invasive plants live along the Saw Mill River. Porcelain berry is a vine with white berries that wraps around native trees and strangles them. Oriental bittersweet is also present along the river, and it is slowly displacing the native American bittersweet. Oriental bitterweet can also form hybrids with the native bittersweet and making identification harder. Japanese honeysuckle and Japanese knotweed are two other invasive vines native to Asia. In addition, purple loosestrife, a perennial herb with magenta flower stalks, is also present along the river. Native trees on the river include the pin oak and staghorn sumac. These trees were found along Woodlands Lake, but can be found throughout the entire Hudson Valley. Other native plants include evening primrose, an invasive species in Europe, and wild lettuce.

International tax law distinguishes between an estate tax and an inheritance tax—an estate tax is assessed on the assets of the deceased, while an inheritance tax is assessed on the legacies received by the estate's beneficiaries. However, this distinction is not always observed; for example, the UK's \\"inheritance tax\\" is a tax on the assets of the deceased, and strictly speaking is therefore an estate tax. For historical reasons, the term death duty is still used colloquially (though not legally) in the UK and some Commonwealth countries. Varieties of inheritance and estate taxes  * Belgium, droits de succession or erfbelasting (Inheritance tax). Collected at the federal level but distributed to the regional level. * Bermuda: stamp duty * Brazil: Imposto sobre Transmissão \\"Causa Mortis\\" e Doação de Quaisquer Bens ou Direitos (Tax on Causa Mortis Transmission and as Donation of any Property and Rights). Collected at the state level. The Brazilian Senate limited the maximum rate to 8%,. * Czech Republic: daň dědická (Inheritance tax) * Denmark: Boafgift (estate duty). Collected at state level. Different rates depending on the relation to the deceased. Spouse: 0%. Children: 15%. Other relatives: 15% of the estate sum + additional 25% of the individual sum. The estate duty is calculated on the sum of the estate after deducting a free allowance on the estate (289,000 DKK in 2018). * Finland: perintövero (Finnish) or arvsskatt (Swedish) (Inheritance tax) is a state tax. Inheritance to the close family is tax free up to the worth of 20 000 €, and increasing from there via several steps (for instance, being 13% for 60 000 € - 200 000 €) to the maximum of 19% that must be paid for the portion of the inheritance that exceeds one million euros. Taxation is more severe in case of remote relatives or those with no family connection at all (19-33%). * France: droits de succession (Inheritance tax) * Germany: Erbschaftsteuer (Inheritance tax). Smaller bequests are exempt, i.e., €20,000–€500,000 depending on the family relation between the deceased and the beneficiary.

History (succession duty) Succession duty, in the English fiscal system, is \\"a tax placed on the gratuitous acquisition of property which passes on the death of any person, by means of a transfer from one person (called the predecessor) to another person (called the successor)\\". In order properly to understand the present state of the English law it is necessary to describe briefly the state of affairs prior to the Finance Act 1894 — an act which effected a considerable change in the duties payable and in the mode of assessment of those duties. The Succession Duty Act 1853 was the principal act that first imposed a succession duty in England. By that act a duty varying from 1% to 10% according to the degree of consanguinity between the predecessor and successor was imposed upon every succession which was defined as \\"every past or future disposition of property by reason whereof any person has or shall become beneficially entitled to any property, or the income thereof, upon the death of any person dying after the time appointed for the commencement of this act, either immediately or after any interval, either certainly or contingently, and either originally or by way of substitutive limitation and every devolution by law of any beneficial interest in property, or the income thereof, upon the death of any person dying after the time appointed for the commencement of this act to any other person in possession or expectancy\\". The property which is liable to pay the duty is in realty or leasehold estate in the UK and personalty—not subject to legacy duty—which the beneficiary claims by virtue of English, Scottish, or Irish law. Personalty in England bequeathed by a person domiciled abroad is not subject to succession duty. Successions of a husband or a wife, successions where the principal value is under £100, and individual successions under £20, are exempt from duty. Leasehold property and personalty directed to be converted into real estate are liable to succession, not to legacy duty. Special provision is made for the collection of duty in the cases of joint tenants and where the successor is also the predecessor. The duty is a first charge on property, but if the property be parted with before the duty is paid the liability of the successor is transferred to the alienee. It is, therefore, usual in requisitions on title before conveyance, to demand for the protection of the purchaser the production of receipts for succession duty, as such receipts are an effectual protection notwithstanding any suppression or misstatement in the account on the footing of which the duty was assessed or any insufficiency of such assessment. The duty is by this act directed to be assessed as follows: on personal property, if the successor takes a limited estate, the duty is assessed on the principal value of the annuity or yearly income estimated according to the period during which he is entitled to receive the annuity or yearly income, and the duty is payable in four yearly installments free from interest. If the successor takes absolutely he pays in a lump-sum duty on the principal value. On real property the duty is payable in eight half-yearly installments without interest on the capital value of an annuity equal to the annual value of the property. Various minor changes were made. The Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1881 exempted personal estates under 300. The Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1888 charged an additional 1% on successions already paying 1% and an additional 11% on successions paying more than 1%. By the Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1889, an additional duty of 1% called an \\"estate duty\\" was payable on successions over 10,000. The Finance Acts 1894 and 1909 effected large changes in the duties payable on death. As regards the succession duties they enacted that payment of the estate duties thereby created should include payment of the additional duties mentioned above. Estates under £1,000 (£2,000 in the case of widow or child of deceased) are exempted from payment of any succession duties. The succession duty payable under the Succession Duty Act 1853 was in all cases to be calculated according to the principal value of the property, i.e., its selling value, and though still payable by installments interest at 3% is chargeable. The additional succession duties are still payable in cases where the estate duty is not charged, but such cases are of small importance and in practice are not as a rule charged. United States The United States imposed a succession duty by the War Revenue Act of 1898 on all legacies or distributive shares of personal property exceeding $10,000 (worth $308,902 in 2020 dollars). This was a tax on the privilege of succession, and devises and land distributions of land were unaffected. The duty ran from 75 cents on the $100 to $5 on the $100, if the legacy or share in question did not exceed $25,000. On those over that value, the rate was multiplied 11 times on estates up to $100,000, twofold on those from $100,000 to $200,000, 21 times on those from $500,000 to a $1 million, and threefold for those exceeding a million. This statute was upheld as constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. Many of the states also impose succession duties, or transfer taxes; generally, however, on collateral and remote successions; sometimes progressive, according to the amount of the succession. The state duties generally touch real estate successions as well as those to personal property. If a citizen of state A owns registered bonds of a corporation chartered by state B, which he has put for safe keeping in a deposit vault in state C, his estate may thus have to pay four succession taxes, one to state A, to which he belongs and which, by legal fiction, is the seat of all his personal property; one to state B, for permitting the transfer of the bonds to the legatees on the books of the corporation; one to state C, for allowing them to be removed from the deposit vault for that purpose; and one to the United States. The different U.S. states all have other regulations regarding inheritance tax: * Louisiana: abolished inheritance tax in 2008, for deaths occurring on or after 1 July 2004 * New Hampshire: abolished state inheritance tax in 2003; abolished surcharge on federal estate tax in 2005 * Utah: abolished inheritance tax in 2005 Some U.S. states impose inheritance or estate taxes (see inheritance tax at the state level): * Indiana: abolished the state inheritance on December 31, 2012 * Iowa: Inheritance is exempt if passed to a surviving spouse, parents, or grandparents, or to children, grandchildren, or other \\"lineal\\" descendants. Other recipients are subject to inheritance tax, with rates varying depending on the relationship of the recipient to the deceased. * Kentucky: The inheritance tax is a tax on a beneficiary's right to receive property from a decedent's estate. It is imposed as a percentage of the amount transferred to the beneficiary:  Transfers to \\"Class A\\" relatives (spouses, parents, children, grandchildren, and siblings) are exempt  Transfers to \\"Class B\\" relatives (nieces, nephews, daughters-in-law, sons-in-law, aunts, uncles, and great-grandchildren) are taxable  Transfers to \\"Class C\\" recipients (all other persons) are taxable at a higher rate. Kentucky imposes an estate tax in addition to its inheritance tax. * Maryland * Nebraska * New Jersey: New Jersey law puts inheritors into different groups, based on their family relationship to the deceased person:  Class A beneficiaries are exempt from the inheritance tax. They includes the deceased person's spouse, domestic partner, or civil union partner parent, grandparent, child (biological, adopted, or mutually acknowledged), stepchild (but not stepgrandchild or great-stepgrandchild), grandchild or other lineal descendant of a child  Class B was deleted when New Jersey law changed  Class C includes the deceased person's: brother or sister, spouse or civil union partner of the deceased person's child, surviving spouse or civil union partner of the deceased person's child. The first $25,000 inherited by someone in Class C is not taxed. On amounts exceeding $25,000, the tax rates are: 11% on the next $1,075,000, 13% on the next $300,000, 14% on the next $300,000, and 16% for anything over $1,700,000  Class D includes everyone else. There is no special exemption amount, and the applicable tax rates are: 15% on the first $700,000, and 16% on anything over $700,000  Class E includes the State of New Jersey or any of its political subdivisions for public or charitable purposes, an educational institution, church, hospital, orphan asylum, public library, and other nonprofits. These beneficiaries are exempt from inheritance tax. * Oklahoma * Pennsylvania: Inheritance tax is a flat tax on the value of the decedent's taxable estate as of the date of death, less allowable funeral and administrative expenses and debts of the decedent. Pennsylvania does not allow the six-month-after-date-of-death alternate valuation method that is available at the federal level. Transfers to spouses are exempt; transfers to grandparents, parents, or lineal descendants are taxed at 4.5%. Transfers to siblings are taxed at 12%. Transfers to any other persons are taxed at 15%. Some assets are exempted, including life insurance proceeds. The inheritance tax is imposed on both residents and nonresidents who owned real estate and tangible personal property in Pennsylvania at the time of their death. The Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Return (Form Rev-1500) must be filed within nine months of the date of death.http://www.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/inheritance_tax/11414 * TennesseeTenn. Code Ann. 67-8-303 Other taxation applied to inheritance  In some jurisdictions, when assets are transferred by inheritance, any unrealized increase in asset value is subject to capital gains tax, payable immediately. This is the case in Canada, which has no inheritance tax. When a jurisdiction has both capital gains tax and inheritance tax, inheritances are generally exempt from capital gains tax. In some jurisdictions, like Austria, death gives rise to the local equivalent of gift tax. This was the UK model before the Inheritance Tax in 1986 was introduced, when estates were charged to a form of gift tax called Capital Transfer Tax. Where a jurisdiction has both gift tax and inheritance tax, it is usual to exempt inheritances from gift tax. Also, it is common for inheritance taxes to share some features of gift taxes, by taxing some transfers which happen during the lifetime of the giver rather than on death. The UK, for example, subjects \\"lifetime chargeable transfers\\" (usually gifts to trusts) to inheritance tax. Historical Ancient Rome No inheritance tax was recorded for the Roman Republic, despite abundant evidence for testamentary law. The vicesima hereditatium (\\"twentieth of inheritance\\") was levied by Rome's first emperor, Augustus, in the last decade of his reign.Jane Gardner, \\"Nearest and Dearest: Liability to Inheritance Tax in Roman Families,\\" in Childhood, Class and Kin in the Roman World pp. 205, 213. The 5% tax applied only to inheritances received through a will, and close relatives were exempt from paying it, including the deceased's grandparents, parents, children, grandchildren, and siblings.Gardner, \\"Liability to Inheritance Tax,\\" pp. 205, 211. The question of whether a spouse was exempt was complicated—from the late Republic on, husbands and wives kept their own property scrupulously separate, since a Roman woman remained part of her birth family and not under the legal control of her husband.Gardner, \\"Liability to Inheritance Tax,\\" p. 214; see further Bruce W. Frier and Thomas A.J. McGinn, A Casebook on Roman Family Law (Oxford University Press, 2004), pp. 19–20, and Beryl Rawson, \\"The Roman Family in Italy\\" (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 15–18. Roman social values on marital devotion probably exempted a spouse.Gardner, \\"Liability to Inheritance Tax,\\" p. 214. Estates below a certain value were also exempt from the tax, according to one source,Cassius Dio 55.25.5. but other evidence indicates that this was only the case in the early years of Trajan's reign.Gardner, \\"Liability to Inheritance Tax,\\" p. 205. Tax revenues went into a fund to pay military retirement benefits (aerarium militare), along with those from a new sales tax (centesima rerum venalium), a 1% tax on goods sold at auction.Gardner, \\"Liability to Inheritance Tax,\\" p. 205; Graham Burton, \\"Government and the Provinces,\\" in The Roman World (Routledge, 1987, 2002), p. 428; Peter Michael Swan, The Augustan Succession: An Historical Commentary on Cassius Dio's Roman History Books 55–56 (9 B.C–A.D. 14) (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 178. The inheritance tax is extensively documented in sources pertaining to Roman law, inscriptions, and papyri.Gardner, \\"Liability to Inheritance Tax,\\" p. 205. A 2nd-century AD epitaph for a Roman of equestrian rank, for instance, lists procurator of the 5 percent inheritance tax on his career résumé (CIL 10.482). It was one of three major indirect taxes levied on Roman citizens in the provinces of the Empire.Burton, \\"Government and the Provinces,\\" p. 428.

He held the metropolitan post before or during the ongoing 11th century East–West Schism. While there is not much verifiable information regarding Hilarion's biography, there are several aspects of his life which have come to be generally accepted. Biography According to the Primary Chronicle Hilarion served as a presbyterKotlyar, M. Hilarion (ІЛАРІОН). Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine in a princely residence of Berestove (today in Kiev). He acquired the reputation of well-educated scholar and upon the death of Metropolitan Theopemptus in 1049, Hilarion was proclaimed the metropolitan of Kiev by council of local bishops on proposition of the Grand prince of Kiev Yaroslav the Wise who thus challenged the old Byzantine tradition of placing Greeks on the episcopal sees. Hilarion was not appointed by the Ecumenical Patriarch Michael I Cerularius. Hilarion's appointment met with stiff opposition from Luka Zhidiata, Bishop of Novgorod (r. 1035-1060). Zhidyata openly opposed probably because it was the prerogative of the Patriarch of Constantinople to appoint the Kievan metropolitan and thus Hilarion's appointment was uncanonical. For his opposition, Luka was confined in the Kievan Caves Monastery for three years until his death, at which time his remains were taken back to Novgorod and buried in the Cathedral of Holy Wisdom there.Michael C. Paul, \\"A Man Chosen By God\\": The Office of Archbishop in Novgorod, Russia 1165-1478 (PhD Dissertation, University of Miami, 2003). It appears as though Hilarion did not serve an extended term as the Kievan metropolitan, as some chronicles began mentioning Metropolitan Yefrem in 1055. Nevertheless, Hilarion remains the best known of all the ancient Kievan metropolitans, not only because he was the first native to ascend to that position, but also because of his writings. Hilarion is credited as the author of four works: * Sermon on Law and Grace, * Confession of Faith * Sermon on Spiritual Benefit to All Christians * a short collection of instructions for priests called \\"Слово к брату столпнику\\" (A word to brother stylites) In 1920s Russian historian Mikhail Prisyolkov introduced a theory according to which Hilarion became a monk under a name of Nikon and settled in Kiev Cave Monastery. He supposedly is the same Nikon who compiled the so-called 1073 Caves Chronicles.

Distribution male Platycryptus undatus Platycryptus undatus occurs in North and Central America. The distribution of this species ranges from the Eastern States and adjacent Canada, to Texas and Wisconsin. Females of this species are between 10 and 13 mm in body length, and males range from 8.5 to 9.5 mm. It favors vertical surfaces such as fences, walls, etc. and because of its habits it is easily seen. Like some other species of jumping spider, this species appears to exhibit curiosity towards humans who come into its visual field (jumping spiders all have very good vision.) It does not frantically flee humans and may be gently \\"herded\\" onto a hand, where it may make a thorough exploration and even jump from finger to finger. These spiders are not inclined to bite, but even though they are rather small they can deliver a defensive bite if they are pinched or squeezed. Eggs are laid and hatch during the summer, and adults and other stages overwinter in their individual silken shelters. Although the shelters are built separately and keep the spiders out of direct contact with each other, Kaston reports that as many as fifty of them may crowd their shelters for hibernation together so tightly that they form a continuous blanket under the loose bark of a standing tree. Physical characteristics The bodies of these spiders are rather compressed in the vertical direction, which allows them to hide themselves under the loosened bark of trees and in other tight places. They have a prominent pattern on their abdomens which may make them more difficult to distinguish on mottled surfaces. References * (2008): The world spider catalog, version 8.5.

It is bordered by the South Para River and the suburbs of Gawler, Gawler West, Evanston, Evanston Park and Bibaringa. History Gawler South is a subdivision of the Gawler township. It has streets named from First to Twenty Fourth, originally named with local identities and royal connections. The suburb has attracted a railway station (see below) and tram line (now disused), racecourse, and Anglican Church during its colonial history. After Federation, suburban infill allowed the nightcart lanes installed into these now suburban blocks to stay at the location. A railway line was built from Adelaide to Gawler in 1879, with the Gawler railway station being established in the Gawler South area. The railway was extended through the Barossa Valley to Angaston in 1911. The Gawler South Station is now still a stationyard for housing trains for the TransAdelaide line to Adelaide.  Layout The housing lots have been arranged in several different directions. This takes into account the stages of development around the suburb. There is a north-south grid orientation around the south-westerly section of the suburb (by the railway station). The shopping precinct along Adelaide Road provides a grid- fashion at approximately 45 degrees to the south-westerly grid. A Housing Trust subdivision was built in the post-World War II period on the river flats, between the South Para and the Gawler Rivers. The suburb today A new subdivision during the 1990s was started on the foothills, adjacent to the South Para River. The shopping precinct is still very commercially viable, extending Gawler's central business district across the Adelaide Road Bridge (on the South Para River) along an almost one kilometre road length. Geography Many of the older streets are named for ordinal numbers (First Street through to Twentyfifth Street). There is no obvious pattern to the layout of streets or the order in which they are named. Some streets on the eastern side align to the contours where the land is too steep to build.

Development and design  In 1954, the design bureau headed by Pavel Tsybin started development of a ramjet-powered supersonic strategic bomber, the RS. This design proved impracticable, and a smaller derivative, the 2RS was proposed, which would achieve intercontinental range by being air-launched from a modified Tupolev Tu-95 bomber.Butowski 1998. p. 39–40. This too was unsuccessful, with the aircraft unable to return to base if used on an intercontinental mission, while being incapable of carrying a thermonuclear bomb.Gunston 1995, p. 376. The design was therefore revised again to a reconnaissance aircraft capable of operating from conventional runways, the RSR. As ramjets could not be used for take-off, they were replaced by turbofans. The RSR was primarily of aluminium construction, with a long circular-section fuselage, which housed a pressurized cabin for the pilot together with cameras and fuel, with thin, low-aspect-ratio trapezoidal wings. The engines, two Soloviev D-21 turbofans, were mounted at the tips of the wings. The aircraft had a bicycle undercarriage, with outriggers under the engine nacelles. It was planned to cruise at greater than Mach 2 at a height of 20,000 m (65,600 ft) giving a range of .

Her semi- autobiographical novel The Pumpkin Eater (1962) was turned into a 1964 film – Anne Bancroft was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as Jo Armitage, a character based on Mortimer herself. Personal life Mortimer was born Penelope Ruth Fletcher in Rhyl, Flintshire (now Denbighshire), Wales, the younger daughter of Amy Caroline Fletcher and the Rev A. F. G. Fletcher, an Anglican clergyman, who had lost his faith and used the parish magazine to celebrate Soviet persecution of the Russian church.Peter Guttridge, Anna Pavord \\"Obituary: Penelope Mortimer\\", The Independent, 23 October 1999, as reproduced on Find Articles website He abused her sexually. Mortimer later wrote of her father: \\"I think he was a clergyman for one reason only; there was nothing else – as Nellie Fletcher's second son – he could possibly have been! As a small boy, bullied and teased by six sisters and four brothers, he sat under the nursery table chanting 'Mama, papa, all the children are disagreeable except me', to the tune of Gentle Jesus'.\\" Her father frequently changed his parish and she attended numerous schools. She was educated across the country, at Croydon High School, the New School, Streatham, Blencathra, Rhyl Garden School, Lane End, St Elphin's School for Daughters of the Clergy, and the Central Educational Bureau for Women. She left University College, London after one year.Giles Gordon \\"Obituary:Penelope Mortimer\\", The Guardian, 22 October 1999. Retrieved on 17 January 2009. Penelope married Charles Dimont, a journalist, in 1937. They had two daughters, including the actress Caroline Mortimer. She also had two daughters through extra-marital relationships with Kenneth Harrison and Randall Swingler. She met the barrister and writer John Mortimer while pregnant with the last child and married him on 27 August 1949, the day that her divorce from Dimont became absolute. Together they had a daughter and a son, Jeremy Mortimer. Their relationship was said to have been happy at first, but soon grew stormy, and from the mid-1950s onward John had a series of extramarital affairs. In the 1950s and 1960s the Mortimer couple were frequently photographed at London high society events, but behind this façade Penelope had frequent bouts of depression. In 1962, the same year The Pumpkin Eater was written, she became pregnant for the eighth time and already acting as a mother of six at the age of 42, she agreed to an abortion and sterilisation at John Mortimer's urging. She is said to have been happy with the decision, but during her convalescence, she discovered her husband's affair with Wendy Craig, by whom he had a son. They divorced in 1971. Writings Mortimer wrote over a dozen novels during her career, focusing on upper middle-class life in British society. She had one novel, Johanna, published under the name Penelope Dimont. Then as Penelope Mortimer she wrote A Villa in Summer (1954, Michael Joseph), which received critical acclaim. Subsequent novels included Daddy's Gone A-Hunting (1958, republished in 2008 by Persephone Books) and The Pumpkin Eater (1962), which dealt with a troubled marriage and had success as a film released in 1964 starring Anne Bancroft. Meanwhile, Mortimer worked freelance as a journalist, her work and stories appearing regularly in The New Yorker. She served as an agony aunt for the Daily Mail under the pseudonym Ann Temple. In the late 1960s, she replaced Penelope Gilliatt as film critic for The Observer. Mortimer continued in journalism, mainly for The Sunday Times, and also wrote screenplays. Her biography of the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother was commissioned by Macmillan, but when completed it was rejected, and eventually published by Viking in 1986. Her former agent Giles Gordon, in his obituary of her in The Guardian, called it \\"the most astute biography of a royal since Lytton Strachey was at work. Penelope had approached her subject as somebody in the public eye, whose career might as well be recorded as if she were a normal human being.\\" Mortimer wrote two volumes of autobiography. About Time: An Aspect of Autobiography, covering her life until 1939, appeared in 1979 and won the Whitbread Prize. About Time Too: 1940–1978 followed in 1993. A third volume, Closing Time, remains unpublished. Death Penelope Mortimer died of cancer in Kensington, London, aged 81.

The genus Nyctosaurus has had numerous species referred to it, though how many of these may actually be valid requires further study. At least one species possessed an extraordinarily large antler-like cranial crest. Nyctosaurus was a mid-sized pterosaur that lived along the shores of the Niobrara Formation of the United States, which back then was within a large inland sea called the Western Interior Seaway. It has been suggested that it would have flown similar to modern-day soaring birds such as albatrosses, which consisted of flying very long distances and rarely flapping. The species N. gracilis and N. nanus have previously been considered as species of the closely related Pteranodon, back then known as P. gracilis and P. nanus, due to their similarities. Discovery and species Juvenile N. gracilis specimen at the Field Museum, Williston's IL P. 25026 The first Nyctosaurus fossils were described in 1876 by Othniel Charles Marsh, based on fragmentary material, holotype YPM 1178, from the Smoky Hill River site in Kansas. Marsh referred the specimen to a species of his new genus Pteranodon, as Pteranodon gracilis.Marsh, O.C. (1876a). \\"Notice of a new sub-order of Pterosauria.\\" American Journal of Science, 11(3): 507-509. Later that year, Marsh reclassified the species in its own genus, which he named Nyctosaurus, meaning \\"night lizard\\" or \\"bat lizard\\", in reference to the wing structure somewhat paralleling those of bats.Marsh, O.C. (1876b). \\"Principal characters of American pterodactyls.\\" American Journal of Science, 12: 479-480. In 1881, Marsh incorrectly assumed the name was preoccupied and changed it into Nyctodactylus, which thus is now a junior synonym.Marsh, O.C. (1881). \\"Note on American pterodactyls.\\" American Journal of Science, 21: 342-343. In 1902, Samuel Wendell Williston described the most complete skeleton then known (P 25026) discovered in 1901 by H. T. Martin. In 1903, Williston named a second species, N. leptodactylus, but this is today considered identical to N. gracilis. Cast of the skull with an elongated crest In 1953, Brazilian paleontologist Llewellyn Ivor Price named a partial humerus, DGM 238-R found in Brazil, N. lamegoi; the specific name honours the geologist Alberto Ribeiro Lamego. This species has an estimated wingspan of four metres; today, it is generally considered to be a form different from Nyctosaurus, but has not yet been assigned its own genus name. In 1972, a new skeleton, FHSM VP-2148, in 1962 discovered by George Fryer Sternberg, was named N. bonneri; today, it is generally seen as identical to N. gracilis. In 1978, Gregory Brown prepared the most complete Nyctosaurus skeleton currently known, UNSM 93000.Brown GW (1978) Preliminary report on an articulated specimen of Pteranodon (Nyctosaurus) gracilis. Proceedings of the Nebraska Academy of Science 88: 39. In 1984, Robert Milton Schoch renamed Pteranodon nanus (Marsh 1881), \\"the dwarf\\", Nyctosaurus nanus. The question of this species validity is currently pending further study.. In the early 2000s, Kenneth Jenkins of Ellis, Kansas collected two specimens of Nyctosaurus, which were the first to demonstrate conclusively that not only was this species crested, but that the crest in mature specimens was very large and elaborate. The specimens were purchased by a private collector in Austin, Texas. Despite being in private hands rather than a museum collection, paleontologist Chris Bennett was able to study the specimens and gave them the manuscript reference numbers KJ1 and KJ2 (for Kenneth Jenkins). Bennett published a description of the specimens in 2003. Despite the unusual crests, the specimens were otherwise indistinguishable from other specimens of Nyctosaurus. However, the then-currently named species were extremely similar and Bennett declined to refer them to a specific one pending further study of the differences, or lack thereof, between species of Nyctosaurus. Description Size and weight Size of a mature, crested specimen (green) compared with a human Nyctosaurus was similar in anatomy to its close relative and contemporary, Pteranodon. It had relatively long wings, similar in shape to modern seabirds. However, it was smaller overall than Pteranodon, with an adult wingspan of and a maximum weight of about 1.86 kg. Some wingspan estimates by German paleontologist Peter Wellnhofer in 1991 however, reached a total of about , and the dubious species \\"N.\\" lamegoi had a wingspan estimate of around according to Price back in 1953. The overall body length was estimated to have been about .Chatterjee, S. and Templin, R.J. (2004). Posture, Locomotion, and Paleoecology of Pterosaurs. Geological Society of America, 64 pp. , Skull and beak Some skull specimens preserve a distinctively large crest, at least tall in the older adults, and was relatively gigantic compared to the rest of the body, while also being over three times the length of the head. The crest is composed of two long, grooved spars, one pointed upward and the other backward, arising from a common base projecting up and back from the back of the skull. The two spars were nearly equal in length, and both were nearly as long or longer than the total length of the body. The upward-pointing crest spar was at least long and the backward-pointing spar was at least long. The jaws of Nyctosaurus were long and extremely pointed. The jaw tips were thin and needle sharp, and are often broken off in fossil specimens, giving the appearance that one jaw is longer than the other, though in life they were probably equal in length. Wings Diagram of the skeleton of Nyctosaurus depicted without a crest Nyctosaurus had wings very similar in built to those of its relative Pteranodon, which have a high aspect ratio and low wing loadings. The wing structure generally resembles that of the modern-day albatross, and therefore also flew like it. Unlike the related Pteranodon however, Nyctosaurus was much smaller in size, and had a relatively shorter wingspan, though still large compared to earlier pterosaurs. Forelimbs Like the closely related Pteranodon, Nyctosaurus also had relatively long forelimbs compared to other earlier genera. Most of the tendons of the upper arm and forearm were mineralized within, this is a unique feature only seen in nyctosaurids, another of which was the related Muzquizopteryx. Another distinctive feature seen in Nyctosaurus was that it only had three phalanges instead of four, as seen in other pterodactyloids, this trait is rarely seen in other pterosaurs, and perhaps may have been an autapomorphy only found in Nyctosaurus. Nyctosaurus had unusually elongated metacarpals which measured about 2.5 times the length of its humerus. Proportions such as these can only be seen in two other groups pterosaurs: the pteranodontids and the azhdarchids. Another feature that Nyctosaurus had in common with Pteranodon was its wing fingers, which occupied about 55 percent of the whole wing. Studies on Nyctosaurus anatomy have concluded that the first, second and third metacarpals of have lost contact with the carpus, similar to pteranodontids, but unlike them, Nyctosaurus, and possibly other nyctosaurids, had also lost the corresponding digits except the \\"flight\\" digit. As a result, it was likely to have impaired its movement on the ground, leading scientists to conjecture that it spent almost all of its time on the wing and rarely landed. In particular, the lack of claws with which to grip surfaces would have made climbing or clinging to cliffs and tree trunks impossible for Nyctosaurus. Hindlimbs Contrary to its elongated forelimbs, Nyctosaurus had proportionally short hindlimbs compared to the overall body size. Analyses show that Nyctosaurus had the shortest hindlimbs of any pterosaur genera, in terms of hindlimb-to-body ratio, which was only about 16 percent the size of its wing. Classification Drawing of Nyctosaurus in a quadrupedal walking position Below is a cladogram following Brian Andres and Timothy Myers in 2013, showing the phylogenetic placement of this genus within the clade Pteranodontia. Two species of Nyctosaurus (N. gracilis and \\"N.\\" lamegoi) were included in the analysis, and were placed within the family Nyctosauridae, sister taxa to Muzquizopteryx. In 2018, a topology by Nicholas Longrich and colleagues had made the clade Pteranodontoidea the more inclusive group, while Pteranodontia was restricted to only pteranodontids and nyctosaurids. In this analysis, three species of Nyctosaurus were included: N. lamegoi, N. nanus and N. gracilis; all three of which were placed as derived members of the Nyctosauridae. Paleobiology Life history Artist's impression of a crested specimen Nyctosaurus, like its relative Pteranodon, appears to have grown very rapidly after hatching. Fully adult specimens are no larger than some immature specimens such as P 25026 (pictured below), indicating that Nyctosaurus went from hatching to adult size (with wingspans of or more) in under a year. Some sub-adult specimens have been preserved with their skulls in nearly pristine condition, and lack any trace of a head crest, indicating that the distinctively large crest only began to develop after the first year of life. The crest may have continued to grow more elaborate as the animal aged, though no studies have examined the age of the fully adult, large- crested specimens. These individuals may have been 5 or even 10 years old at the time of their deaths. Crest function Skeletal reconstruction of a crested specimen Only five relatively complete Nyctosaurus skulls have been found. Of those, one is juvenile and does not possess a crest (specimen FMNH P 25026), and two are more mature and may show signs of having had a crest but are too badly crushed to say for sure (FHSM 2148 and CM 11422). Two specimens (KJ1 and KJ2) described in 2003, however, preserved an enormous double-pronged crest. A few scientists had initially hypothesized that this crest, which resembles an enormous antler, may have supported a skin \\"headsail\\" used for stability in flight. While there is no fossil evidence for such a sail, studies have shown that a membranous attachment to the bony crest would have imparted aerodynamic advantages. However, in the actual description of the fossils, paleontologist Christopher Bennett argued against the possibility of a membrane or soft tissue extension to the crest. Bennett noted that the edges of each prong were smooth and rounded, and showed no evidence for any soft- tissue attachment points. He also compared Nyctosaurus with large-crested tapejarids, which do preserve soft tissue extensions supported by prongs, and showed that, in those species, the attachment points were obvious, with jagged edges where the transition from bone to soft tissue occurred. Bennett concluded that the crest was most likely used solely for display, citing similar structures in modern animals. The 2009 study by Xing and colleagues testing the aerodynamics of the giant crest with a \\"headsail\\" also tested the aerodynamics of the same crest with no sail, and found that it added no significant negative factors, so a crest with no headsail would not have hindered normal flight. It is more likely that the crest acted mainly for display, and that any aerodynamic effects it may have had were secondary. Bennett also argued that the crest was probably not a sexually dimorphic character, as in most crested pterosaurs, including the related Pteranodon, both sexes are crested and it is only the size and shape of the crest that differs. The apparently non-crested Nyctosaurus specimens therefore probably came from sub-adults. Wing loading and speed Researchers Sankar Chatterjee and R.J. Templin used estimates based on complete Nyctosaurus specimens to determine weight and total wing area, and to calculate its total wing loading. They also estimated its total available flight power based on estimated musculature. Using these calculations, they estimated the cruising speed of Nyctosaurus gracilis as 9.6 meters/second (34.5 kilometers/hour or 21.4 miles/hour). Paleoecology Map of North America during the mid- Cretaceous period, illustrating the Western Interior Seaway All known Nyctosaurus fossils come from the Smoky Hill Chalk of Kansas, part of the Niobrara Formation. Specifically, they are found only within a narrow zone characterised by the abundance of ammonite fossils belonging to the species Spinaptychus sternbergi. These limestone deposits were laid down during a marine regression of the Western Interior Seaway that lasted between 85 and 84.5 million years ago. Therefore, Nyctosaurus was a relatively short-lived species, unlike its relative Pteranodon, which is found throughout almost all of the Niobrara layers into the overlying Pierre Shale Formation, and existed between 88 and 80.5 million years ago.Carpenter, K. (2003). \\"Vertebrate Biostratigraphy of the Smoky Hill Chalk (Niobrara Formation) and the Sharon Springs Member (Pierre Shale).\\" High-Resolution Approaches in Stratigraphic Paleontology, 21: 421-437. The ecosystem preserved in this zone was unique in its abundance of vertebrate life. Nyctosaurus shared the sky with the bird Ichthyornis and with Pteranodon longiceps, though the second Niobrara Pteranodon species, P. sternbergi, had disappeared from the fossil record by this point. In the waters of the Western Interior Seaway below swam mosasaurs such as Clidastes, Ectenosaurus, Eonatator, Halisaurus, Platecarpus and Tylosaurus, several remains of the plesiosaurs Dolichorhynchops and Polycotylus, cephalopods like Baculites and Tusoteuthis, and the sea turtles such as Ctenochelys and Toxochelys were also found. Flightless diving birds such as Ichthyornis and Parahesperornis were also known from the fossil site, a wide variety of fish including swordfish-like Protosphyraena, as well as the predatory fishes Pachyrhizodus, Xiphactinus, Ichthyodectes, Gillicus, Leptecodon, Enchodus and Cimolichthys, the filter feeding Bonnerichthys, the dorsal finned Bananogmius, and the cartilaginous fishes Cretolamna, Ptychodus, Rhinobatos and Squalicorax were also found within the formation. Several dinosaur genera were found along with Nyctosaurus remains, these included the nodosaurids Hierosaurus and Niobrarasaurus, as well as the hadrosaur Claosaurus.K. Carpenter, D. W.

It was the last stage of the Boshin War, and occurred around Hakodate in the northern Japanese island of Hokkaidō. In Japanese, it is also known as the According to the Japanese calendar, the Battle of Hakodate was fought from Meiji-1 year (gannen), 10-month, 21-day until Meiji-2 year, 5-month 18-day. Background The Boshin War erupted in 1868 between troops favorable to the restoration of political authority to the Emperor and the government of the Tokugawa shogunate. The Meiji government defeated the forces of the Shōgun at the Battle of Toba–Fushimi and subsequently occupied the Shōgun's capital at Edo. Enomoto Takeaki, vice-commander of the Shogunate Navy, refused to remit his fleet to the new government and departed Shinagawa on August 20, 1868, with four steam warships (Kaiyō, Kaiten, Banryū, Chiyodagata) and four steam transports (Kanrin Maru, Mikaho, Shinsoku, Chōgei) as well as 2,000 sailors, 36 members of the \\"Yugekitai\\" (guerilla corps) headed by Iba Hachiro, several officials of the former Bakufu government including the vice-commander in chief of the Shogunate Army Matsudaira Taro, Nakajima Saburozuke, and members of the French Military Mission to Japan, headed by Jules Brunet. On August 21, the fleet encountered a typhoon off Chōshi, in which Mikaho was lost and Kanrin Maru, heavily damaged, forced to turn back, where she was captured at Shimizu.

The Banryū and Chiyodagata are absent. 1868 photograph. The rest of the fleet reached Sendai harbor on August 26, one of the centers of the Northern Coalition (奥羽越列藩同盟) against the new government, composed of the fiefs of Sendai, Yonezawa, Aizu, Shōnai and Nagaoka. Imperial troops continued to progress north, taking the castle of Wakamatsu, and making the position in Sendai untenable. On October 12, 1868, the fleet left Sendai, after having acquired two more ships (Ōe and the Hōō, previously borrowed by Sendai Domain from the Shogunate), and about 1,000 more troops: former-Bakufu troops under Ōtori Keisuke, Shinsengumi troops under Hijikata Toshizō, Yugekitai under Katsutaro Hitomi, as well as several more French advisors (Fortant, Marlin, Bouffier, Garde), who had reached Sendai overland. Battle Occupation of southern Hokkaidō The rebels, numbering around 3,000 and traveling by ship with Enomoto Takeaki reached Hokkaidō in October 1868. They landed on Takanoki Bay, behind Hakodate on October 20. Hijikata Toshizo and Otori Keisuke each led a column in the direction of Hakodate. They eliminated local resistance by forces of Matsumae Domain, which had declared its loyalty to the new Meiji government, and occupied the fortress of Goryōkaku on October 26, which became the command center for the rebel army. The fortress of Goryōkaku, headquarters of the rebel army. Various expeditions were organized to take full control of the southern peninsula of Hokkaidō. On November 5, Hijikata, commanding 800 troops and supported by the warships Kaiten and Banryo occupied the castle of Matsumae. On November 14, Hijikata and Matsudaira converged on the city of Esashi, with the added support of the flagship Kaiyo Maru, and the transport ship Shinsoku. Unfortunately, Kaiyō Maru was shipwrecked and lost in a tempest near Esashi, and Shinsoku also was lost as it came to its rescue, dealing a terrible blow to the rebel forces. After eliminating all local resistance, on December 25, the rebels founded the Ezo Republic, with a government organization modeled after that of the United States, with Enomoto Takeaki, as President (総裁). The Meiji government in Tokyo refused to recognise the breakaway republic. A defense network was established around Hakodate in anticipation of the attack by the troops of the new Imperial government. The Ezo Republic troops were structured under a hybrid Franco-Japanese leadership, with Commander in chief Ōtori Keisuke seconded by Jules Brunet, and each of the four brigades commanded by a French officer (Fortant, Marlin, André Cazeneuve, Bouffier), seconded by eight half-brigade Japanese commanders. Two ex-French Navy officers, Eugène Collache and Henri Nicol further joined the rebels, and Collache was put in charge of building fortified defenses along the volcanic mountains around Hakodate, while Nicol was in charge of re-organizing the Navy. In the meantime, an Imperial fleet had been rapidly constituted around the ironclad warship Kōtetsu, which had been purchased by the Meiji government from the United States. Other Imperial ships were Kasuga, Hiryū, Teibō, Yōshun, Mōshun, which had been supplied by the fiefs of Saga, Chōshū and Satsuma to the newly formed government in 1868. The fleet left Tokyo on March 9, 1869, and headed north. Miyako Bay Kōtetsu. The Imperial navy reached the harbor of Miyako on March 20. Anticipating the arrival of the Imperial fleet, the rebels organized a daring plan to seize the powerful new warship Kōtetsu. Three warships were dispatched for a surprise attack, in what is known as the Naval Battle of Miyako: the Kaiten, on which were riding the elite Shinsengumi as well as the ex-French Navy officer Henri Nicol, the warship Banryu, with the ex-French officer Clateau, and the warship Takao, with ex-French Navy officer Eugène Collache on board. To create surprise, the Kaiten entered Miyako harbor with an American flag. They raised the Ezo Republic flag seconds before boarding the Kōtetsu. The crew of Kōtetsu managed to repel the attack with a Gatling gun, with huge losses to the attackers. The two Ezo warships escaped back to Hokkaidō, but the Takao was pursued and beached itself. Landing of Imperial forces The Imperial troops, numbering 7,000, finally landed on Hokkaidō on April 9, 1869. They progressively took over various defensive positions, until the final stand occurred around the fortress of Goryōkaku and Benten Daiba around the city of Hakodate. Japan's first major naval engagement between two modern navies, the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay, occurred towards the end of the conflict, during the month of May 1869.Lesser preceding actions were the Battle of Shimonoseki Straits (1863) and Battle of Awa (1868). Before the final surrender, in June 1869, the Ezo Republic French military advisors escaped to a French Navy warship stationed in Hakodate Bay, the Coëtlogon, from where they returned to Yokohama and thence to France. After having lost close to half their numbers and most of their ships, the military of Ezo Republic surrendered to the Meiji government on June 27, 1869. Aftermath Hijikata Toshizō, leader of the Shinsengumi, fought against the Imperial troops and died in the battle of Hakodate. The battle marked the end of the old feudal regime in Japan, and the end of armed resistance to the Meiji Restoration. After a few years in prison, several of the leaders of the rebellion were rehabilitated, and continued with brilliant political careers in the new unified Japan: Enomoto Takeaki in particular took various ministry functions during the Meiji period. The new Imperial government, finally secure, established numerous new institutions soon after the end of the conflict. The Imperial Japanese Navy in particular was formally established in July 1869, and incorporated many of the combatants and ships which had participated in the Battle of Hakodate. The future admiral Tōgō Heihachirō, hero of the 1905 Battle of Tsushima, participated in the battle as a gunner on board the paddle steam warship Kasuga. Later depictions of the battle Although the Battle of Hakodate involved some of the most modern armament of the era (steam warships, and even an ironclad warship, barely invented 10 years earlier with the world's first seagoing ironclad, the French La Gloire), Gatling guns, Armstrong guns, modern uniforms and fighting methods, most of the later Japanese depictions of the battle during the few years after the Meiji Restoration offer an anachronistic representation of traditional samurai fighting with their swords, possibly in an attempt to romanticize the conflict, or to downplay the amount of modernization already achieved during the Bakumatsu period (1853–1868). Enomoto (Kinjiro) Takeaki, Ōtori Keisuke, Matsudaira Tarō. The samurai in yellow garment is Hijikata Toshizō. French soldiers are shown behind the cavalry charge in white trousers. Imperial troops with modern uniforms are on the right (the \\"Red bear\\" (赤熊, Shaguma) wigs indicate soldiers from Tosa (\\"White bear\\" (白熊, Haguma) wigs for Chōshū, \\"Black bear\\" (黒熊, Koguma) wigs for Satsuma)), with a modern steam warship in the background. Significance Modernization Although the modernization of Japan is generally explained as starting with the Meiji period (1868), it actually started significantly earlier from around 1853 during the final years of the Tokugawa shogunate (the Bakumatsu period). The 1869 Battle of Hakodate shows two sophisticated adversaries in an essentially modern conflict, where steam power and guns play the key role, although some elements of traditional combat clearly remained. A great deal of Western scientific and technological knowledge had already been entering Japan since around 1720 through rangaku, the study of Western sciences, and since 1853, the Tokugawa shogunate had been extremely active at modernizing the country and opening it to foreign influence. In a sense, the Restoration movement, based on the sonnō jōi ideology was a reaction to this modernization and internationalization, although, in the end, the Meiji Emperor chose to follow a similar policy under the Fukoku kyōhei (\\"rich country, strong army\\") principle. Some of his former supporters from Satsuma, such as Saigō Takamori would revolt against this situation, leading to the Satsuma Rebellion in 1877. French involvement A group of French military advisors, members of the 1st French Military Mission to Japan and headed by Jules Brunet, fought side- by-side with troops of the former Tokugawa bakufu, whom they had trained during 1867–1868. The Battle of Hakodate also reveals a period of Japanese history when France was strongly involved with Japanese affairs. Similarly, the interests and actions of other Western powers in Japan were quite significant, but to a lesser extent than with the French. This French involvement is part of the broader, and often disastrous, foreign activity of the French Empire under Napoleon III, and followed the Campaign of Mexico. The members of the French Mission who followed their Japanese allies to the North all resigned or deserted from the French Army before accompanying them. Although they were speedily rehabilitated upon their return to France, and some, such as Jules Brunet continued illustrious careers, their involvement was not premeditated or politically guided, but rather a matter of personal choice and conviction. Although defeated in this conflict, and again defeated in the Franco-Prussian War, France continued to play an important role in Japan's modernization: a Second Military Mission was invited in 1872, and the first true modern fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy was built under the supervision of the French engineer Émile Bertin in the 1880s.

A muffle furnace or muffle oven (sometimes retort furnace in historical usage) is a furnace in which the subject material is isolated from the fuel and all of the products of combustion, including gases and flying ash.Bulletin - United States Geological Survey, Issues 47–54, 1889, pp. 180 (834) After the development of high-temperature heating elements and widespread electrification in developed countries, new muffle furnaces quickly moved to electric designs. Modern furnace Today, a muffle furnace is often a front-loading box-type oven or kiln for high-temperature applications such as fusing glass, creating enamel coatings, ceramics and soldering and brazing articles. They are also used in many research facilities, for example by chemists in order to determine what proportion of a sample is non-combustible and non-volatile (i.e., ash). Some models incorporate programmable digital controllers, allowing automatic execution of ramping, soaking, and sintering stepsStableTemp Furnace Datasheet. Also, advances in materials for heating elements, such as molybdenum disilicide, can now produce working temperatures up to , which facilitate more sophisticated metallurgical applications. The heat source may be gas or oil burners, but more often they are now electric. The term muffle furnace may also be used to describe another oven constructed on many of the same principles as the box-type kiln mentioned above, but takes the form of a long, wide, and thin hollow tube used in roll-to-roll manufacturing processes. Both of the above-mentioned furnaces are usually heated to desired temperatures by conduction, convection, or blackbody radiation from electrical resistance heater elements. Therefore, there is (usually) no combustion involved in the temperature control of the system, which allows for much greater control of temperature uniformity and assures isolation of the material being heated from the byproducts of fuel combustion. Muffle kilns Historically, small muffle ovens were often used for a second firing of porcelain at a relatively low temperature to fix overglaze enamels; these tend to be called muffle kilns. The pigments for most enamel colours discoloured at the high temperatures required for the body and glaze of the porcelain. They were used for painted enamels on metal for the same reason. Like other types of muffle furnaces, the design isolates the objects from the flames producing the heat (with electricity this is not so important). For historical overglaze enamels the kiln was generally far smaller than that for the main firing, and produced firing temperatures in the approximate range of 750 to 950 °C, depending on the colours used. Typically, wares were fired for between five and twelve hours and then cooled over twelve hours.Hughes, G Bernard, The Country Life Pocket Book of China, 1965, Country Life Ltd, pp. 34–35 See also * Saggar References Category:Industrial furnaces Category:Decorative arts Category:Pottery ","title":"Muffle furnace"},{"id":"5824794","text":"Huelva Castaño del Robledo is a town and municipality located in the province of Huelva, Spain.

Globidens alabamaensis was the first species of Globidens described, in a publication by Charles W. Gilmore (1912). It is used as the type specimen for Globidens. Globidens belongs to the family Mosasauridae, which consists of several genera of predatory marine reptiles prevalent during the Late Cretaceous. Specimens of Globidens have been discovered in North America, Morocco, Angola, and Indonesia. Among mosasaurs, Globidens is probably most well known for its highly rounded, globe-like teeth. Description Life restoration of G. alabamaensis Globidens was ~6 m (20 ft) in length and in appearance very much like other mosasaurs (streamlined body with flippers, a laterally flattened tail and powerful jaws). The teeth of Globidens differed from those of other mosasaurs in being globular, giving rise to its generic name. Generally, most mosasaurs had sharp teeth evolved to grab soft, slippery prey like fish and squid, which in some later species were modified to rend flesh, as well. While many other mosasaurs were capable of crushing the shells of ammonites, none were as specialized for dealing with armored prey as Globidens. Globidens had semispherical teeth with rounded nubbin-like points, which were much better suited for crushing tough armored prey like small turtles, ammonites, nautili, and bivalves. Like its larger relative, Mosasaurus, Globidens had a robustly built skull with tightly-articulating jaws. Such features no doubt played a large role in its ability to penetrate the armor of its shelled prey. Gilmore's initial assessment of Globidens, based on an incomplete specimen of G. alabamaensis, made note of characteristics observable in parts of the skull, the teeth, and one of the cervical vertebrae. He made note of a long snout with a large maxilla; a large, sturdy frontal bone; and the characteristic globular teeth with finely wrinkled enamel. Gilmore concluded that the skull characters were similar to Platecarpus or, more closely, to Brachysaurus (currently Prognathodon). Reconstructed skull of G. dakotensis Studies since Gilmore's assessment establish more specific and more complete lists of diagnostic features. Gilmore correctly inferred that Globidens had a stout, powerfully built skull. In addition, a few notable skull characteristics include: a small parietal foramen, located entirely within the parietal; tuberosities present on the jugal; a longitudinal crest present on the dorsal surface of the frontal; and a premaxilla with a rostrum anterior to the premaxillary teeth. The rounded teeth with finely wrinkled enamel seen in Globidens are characteristic of Globidensini; however, the degree of rounding on individual teeth may be indicative of genus or even species. Marginal teeth in Globidens become most subspherical toward the center of the jaws. Additionally, Globidens had thirteen maxillary teeth, and either lacked or showed only rudimentary pterygoid dentition. History of discovery Globidens was first described in 1912 by Charles W. Gilmore. Using an incomplete specimen consisting only of a partial skull with several teeth, a single cervical vertebra, and numerous fragments, Gilmore identified Globidens as a new genus, naming his type specimen Globidens alabamaensis. The genus name was based on the globular structure of the specimen's teeth, and the species name on the location in which it was discovered. (It may be noted that the original location from which the specimen was taken is not precisely known, as Gilmore was examining a specimen that had been collected earlier.) (Gilmore 1912) Since Gilmore's identification of Globidens, several other species have been identified, including G. dakotensis (Russel 1975), which currently is sometimes used as a secondary type specimen alongside G. alabamaensis. Some specimens previously thought to be new species of Globidens have since been reassigned to other taxa such as Prognathodon, or placed in a new taxa, such as G. aegypticus which is now a type specimen for Igdamanosaurus. Species Holotype maxilla (USNM 6527.jpg) of G. alabamaensis *Globidens alabamaensis Gilmore, 1912 - (Type specimen) Height of the tooth crown is less than the greatest tooth crown diameter behind the seventh maxillary tooth; crown length greater than crown width in front of the tenth maxillary tooth. The maxilla is long and the frontal narrow. Frontal bone slightly enters the orbits dorsally. *G. dakotaensis Russell, 1975 - Height of the tooth crown is less than the greatest tooth crown diameter behind the fourth maxillary tooth; crown length greater than crown width in front of the tenth maxillary tooth. The maxilla is long and the frontal broad. Frontal bone does not enter the orbits dorsally. *G. phosphaticus Bardet et al. 2005 from Morocco and Angola. *G. simplex LeBlanc et al. 2019 from Morocco. A complete mandible and partial skull was recovered, showing large jaw adductor musculature attachment points indicative of hard shelled prey. A shortened dentary with respect to the Posterior Mandibular Unit relative to other globidensine mosasaurs supports this as well. Postcranial remains were also recovered, and histological analysis of one rib showed increased bone compactness reminiscent of conditions seen in early stages in marine tetrapod evolution, suggesting increased ability to stay submerged for long periods along the sea floor. Further study or additional specimens may be necessary for the following: *G. schurmanni Martin, 2007 Reassigned species *Globidens aegyptiacus Zdansky, 1935;Zdansky, O. 1935.

Carinodens is thus regarded as a sister taxon of Globidens. Placement of Globidens and, to an extent, Mosasauridae in a phylogenetic tree is somewhat unclear, and specific placement of genera varies between many morphological and molecular tests. It is generally agreed that Mosasauridae is a sister group to Pythonomorpha, which includes all snakes.Caldwell, M. W. 1999. Squamate phylogeny and the relationships of snakes and mosasauroids. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 125(1):115-147 Within Mosasauridae, Globidens is generally placed near Prognathodon, although some placements of Prognathodon specimens are questionable. Cladogram of mosasaurs and related taxa modified from Aaron R. H. Leblanc, Michael W. Caldwell and Nathalie Bardet, 2012: Paleobiology Lateral and oblique, medial view of the left maxilla of G. alabamaensis Globidens was somewhat uniquely adapted to take advantage of hard-shelled food resources, in comparison to other mosasaurs. In addition to a generally robust skull, its teeth are adapted for crushing, rather than piercing or tearing. Therefore, it is believed that Globidens was a durophagous predator, eating mollusks such as bivalves and ammonites.Massare, J. A. 1987.

Bounded quantifiers differ from \\"∀\\" and \\"∃\\" in that bounded quantifiers restrict the range of the quantified variable. The study of bounded quantifiers is motivated by the fact that determining whether a sentence with only bounded quantifiers is true is often not as difficult as determining whether an arbitrary sentence is true. Examples of bounded quantifiers in the context of real analysis include \\"∀x>0\\", \\"∃y<0\\", and \\"∀x ∊ ℝ\\". Informally \\"∀x>0\\" says \\"for all x where x is larger than 0\\", \\"∃y<0\\" says \\"there exists a y where y is less than 0\\" and \\"∀x ∊ ℝ\\" says \\"for all x where x is a real number\\". For example, says \\"every positive number is the square of a negative number\\".  Bounded quantifiers in arithmetic  Suppose that L is the language of Peano arithmetic (the language of second-order arithmetic or arithmetic in all finite types would work as well). There are two types of bounded quantifiers: \\\\forall n < t and \\\\exists n < t. These quantifiers bind the number variable n and contain a numeric term t which may not mention n but which may have other free variables. (\\"Numeric terms\\" here means terms such as \\"1 + 1\\", \\"2\\", \\"2 × 3\\", \\"m + 3\\", etc.) These quantifiers are defined by the following rules (\\\\phi denotes formulas): :\\\\exists n < t\\\\, \\\\phi \\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\exists n ( n < t \\\\land \\\\phi) :\\\\forall n < t\\\\, \\\\phi \\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\forall n ( n < t \\\\rightarrow \\\\phi) There are several motivations for these quantifiers. * In applications of the language to recursion theory, such as the arithmetical hierarchy, bounded quantifiers add no complexity. If \\\\phi is a decidable predicate then \\\\exists n < t \\\\, \\\\phi and \\\\forall n < t\\\\, \\\\phi are decidable as well. * In applications to the study of Peano arithmetic, the fact that a particular set can be defined with only bounded quantifiers can have consequences for the computability of the set. For example, there is a definition of primality using only bounded quantifiers: a number n is prime if and only if there are not two numbers strictly less than n whose product is n. There is no quantifier-free definition of primality in the language \\\\langle 0,1,+,\\\\times, <, =\\\\rangle, however. The fact that there is a bounded quantifier formula defining primality shows that the primality of each number can be computably decided. In general, a relation on natural numbers is definable by a bounded formula if and only if it is computable in the linear- time hierarchy, which is defined similarly to the polynomial hierarchy, but with linear time bounds instead of polynomial. Consequently, all predicates definable by a bounded formula are Kalmár elementary, context-sensitive, and primitive recursive. In the arithmetical hierarchy, an arithmetical formula which contains only bounded quantifiers is called \\\\Sigma^0_0, \\\\Delta^0_0, and \\\\Pi^0_0. The superscript 0 is sometimes omitted.  Bounded quantifiers in set theory  Suppose that L is the language \\\\langle \\\\in, \\\\ldots, =\\\\rangle of the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, where the ellipsis may be replaced by term- forming operations such as a symbol for the powerset operation. There are two bounded quantifiers: \\\\forall x \\\\in t and \\\\exists x \\\\in t. These quantifiers bind the set variable x and contain a term t which may not mention x but which may have other free variables. The semantics of these quantifiers is determined by the following rules: :\\\\exists x \\\\in t\\\\ (\\\\phi) \\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\exists x ( x \\\\in t \\\\land \\\\phi) :\\\\forall x \\\\in t\\\\ (\\\\phi) \\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\forall x ( x \\\\in t \\\\rightarrow \\\\phi) A ZF formula which contains only bounded quantifiers is called \\\\Sigma_0, \\\\Delta_0, and \\\\Pi_0. This forms the basis of the Lévy hierarchy, which is defined analogously with the arithmetical hierarchy. Bounded quantifiers are important in Kripke–Platek set theory and constructive set theory, where only Δ0 separation is included. That is, it includes separation for formulas with only bounded quantifiers, but not separation for other formulas. In KP the motivation is the fact that whether a set x satisfies a bounded quantifier formula only depends on the collection of sets that are close in rank to x (as the powerset operation can only be applied finitely many times to form a term). In constructive set theory, it is motivated on predicative grounds.

A native of Pennsylvania, he published a newspaper in St. Louis, Missouri, before traveling the Oregon Trail to the unorganized Oregon Country. A Democrat, Curry served in the new Oregon Territory's government as a representative to the legislature and as Territorial Secretary before appointment as the last Governor of the Oregon Territory. Curry County in Southern Oregon is named in his honor. Early life Curry was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on July 2, 1820, to Mr. and Mrs. George Curry.Corning, Howard M. (1989) Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 68. Though he received little formal education, he became well read and educated through self study. He also spent some of his childhood in Caracas, Venezuela. In 1831, he began a long career in the newspaper business when he started working in Boston as an apprentice printer. Curry moved west to Missouri where he published the newspaper The Reveille in St. Louis from 1842 to 1845. Oregon Curry in 1853 In 1846, he emigrated overland to the unorganized Oregon Country and settled in Oregon City. Once in Oregon, Curry's experience in the newspaper business landed him a job editing the Oregon Spectator, an early newspaper owned by George Abernethy. Abernethy's views that politics should be kept out of the Spectator led Curry to resign from the paper after only a year and a half. Curry's belief that this policy was censorship put him at odds with the paper's management. In 1848, he set up the Oregon Free Press in Oregon City in competition with his former employer, the same year as the creation of the Oregon Territory. The newspaper soon failed as the California Gold Rush temporarily drained the territory of people and advertisers. At the second session of the Oregon Territorial Legislature held from 1850 to 1851, he worked as the chief clerk of the lower chamber House of Representatives. In the 1851 to 1852 session he served in the House representing Clackamas County. Curry next served as the Secretary of the Oregon Territory from 1853 to 1854, with the office as the first in line to succession to the Governor. Twice he stepped in as Acting Territorial Governor: May 19, 1853 – December 2, 1853; upon Acting Governor Joseph Lane's return to Congress and for six months in 1854, upon the resignation of John W. Davis. U.S. President Franklin Pierce then officially appointed Curry to the position, which he held until Oregon Statehood in 1859. As a prominent local man, Curry was received much more favorably by the population whereas most of his predecessors were seen as outsiders from the East Coast. During the Yakima War in 1855, Governor Curry raised a force of 2,500 volunteers and led them into battle in support of federal troops. Oregon prepared for statehood under Governor Curry, approving a state constitution and electing John Whiteaker as the first Governor of the State of Oregon in 1857. On February 14, 1859; Congress passed the Oregon Statehood Bill, and President James Buchanan signed it; creating Oregon as the thirty-third state of the Union. Upon this act, Curry's position was abolished. Later life and family Curry married Chloe Donnelly Boone in 1848, the daughter of ferry operator Alphonso Boone. Alphonso operated Boones Ferry and was the grandson of Daniel Boone. Curry and Chloe had five children. After leaving office, Curry attempted an 1860 run for the United States Senate, losing by one vote in the State Legislature.Lansing, Ronald B. 2005.

He served as editor of the Portland Advertiser from 1861 to 1862, followed by editing Portland's Evening Journal in 1876. He also returned to making jewelry, and settled in Boone's Landing (now Wilsonville). George Law Curry died on July 28, 1878, at the age of 58 and was buried at Lone Fir Cemetery in Portland.

History In the first decades of the nineteenth century, Buckfastleigh and Ashburton were important towns in the region. Ashburton was an important stannary and woollen town, while Buckfastleigh had established woollen mills as well as other manufacturing industries. Both towns were on the coaching road from Plymouth to Exeter, and this transport link was important to their success. When railways in the area began to be proposed, a number of alternative routes between Plymouth and Exeter were put forward, and a line through Buckfastleigh and Ashburton was considered. However the line actually adopted was the South Devon Railway which followed a more southerly course through Teignmouth, Newton Abbot and Totnes. This line opened in 1847,To Totnes; it had opened the previous year to Newton, later called Newton Abbot; and the following year from Totnes to Plymouth, Laira Green. and Buckfastleigh and Ashburton were not close to the new railway. They quickly found that other towns that were railway-connected gained in importance as their transport costs were reduced, and Buckfastleigh and Ashburton declined rapidly due to the competitive disadvantage. It was clear to local people that the impact on the towns would be seriously negative, as the coach traffic would cease, and Buckfastleigh and Ashburton would be off the contemporary transport network. It appears that Totnes was concerned too, for on 14 June 1845 a public meeting there resolved that \\"it is most essential to the interest and welfare of this town to be connected by railway with the towns of Buckfastleigh and Ashburton as leading to develop the resources of this important town and agricultural district.\\" The enthusiasm to vote for the motion seems not to have been carried into urgent action, but on 27 July 1848 that a Totnes Buckfastleigh and Ashburton Railway obtained its authorising Act of Parliament; authorised capital was £130,000, and the engineer was Isambard Kingdom Brunel. At this time getting money was extremely difficult, and it proved impossible to raise the required capital; in 1851 the company was dissolved, with nothing done. A viable scheme Decline had been predicted for the industries of Buckfastleigh and Ashburton if they were isolated from the railway network, and the gloomy forecast proved true. In 1863 interested men of affairs promoted a new railway, this time to connect to the South Devon Railway (SDR) at Totnes, and to extend to the quayside on the River Dart. In due course on 25 June 1864According to Kingdom and Awdry; Carter says 25 July 1864. the Buckfastleigh, Totnes and South Devon Railway Company obtained an authorising Act of Parliament. The main line was to be not quite ten miles (16 km) long. The short branch, a \\"railway or tramway\\", to the Quays at Totnes was on the south side of the SDR main line, and was to be horse-worked. The use of locomotives, stationary engines and ropes, or \\"atmospheric agency\\" (i.e. the now discredited atmospheric traction system), were all forbidden. The line was to be on the broad gauge. Raising the money was a little easier now than in 1848, but Ashburton's omission from the scheme cut off a large section of potential financial support, and the following year a further Act was obtained, on 26 May 1845, authorising an extension of the line to Ashburton; however the town remained absent from the Company name. Construction and opening Construction of the line was exceedingly slow due to difficulty in raising money. Although some work had been done in 1867, in 1868 it was reported that work was at a standstill, and that Parliamentary authority of an extension of time needed to be applied for.Directors' Report to Shareholders' General Meeting, 29 February 1868, partly quoted in Kingdom In 1869 authorityBuckfastleigh, Totnes and South Devon Railway Act, 1869 was obtained to raise some money by the issue of 5% preference shares,Subscribers were guaranteed their 5% if the Company made enough net profit to pay that, and this dividend took precedence over the dividend for ordinary shares. and certain debenture loans. Opening—of the main line At length the construction of the line was completed, and amid much rejoicing and festivity the line from Ashburton to Totnes SDR station opened for passenger and goods traffic on 1 May 1872; it was worked from the outset by the South Devon Railway. The traditional industries of the district in general had further declined, but the woollen mills of Buckfastleigh had resisted the trend, and they provided much of the goods traffic on the line: manufactured articles outwards and coal for the plant inwards. Passenger traffic on the line was significant, but not dominant. The first half-year accounts (to 31 March 1873) showed gross receipts of £1893 10s 0d, and net profit of £1055 12s 7d after deduction of the SDR charges for working the line. 45,336 passenger journeys had been made, and over 12,000 tons of goods had been carried. The Quay line The construction of the tramway to the Quays had not been carried out with the main line, but by October 1873 it was reported that it was completed, but could not be opened because of required alterations to the signalling on the SDR at the junction with that company's main line at Totnes. However this was soon rectified and the Quay line opened 10 November 1873; it was for goods traffic only, and was horse-operated.Except for a stub at the main line end, where locomotives were permitted after 24 August 1874. An appeal against SDR charges At the October 1873 Shareholders' Meeting the directors reported that the charges from the SDR for operating the line were higher than expected and were not in accordance with the agreement for working the line. £1,055 operating profit in a half-year was small on capital of £130,000 when debenture interest was to be paid first, and it would \\"leave nothing for Dividend\\". At the May 1874 meeting, the directors congratulated the shareholders on a successful outcome of the dispute; however the full year (1873) accounts now showed £4147 12s 10d gross profit, £2127 4s 0d net. The first half-year SDR charge before the dispute, and doubled to equate to a full year, were £1676 (44%), and the actual post-dispute charge was £2020 (49%). It is difficult to follow how this was an improvement; however the Directors, on this and subsequent occasions, urged consignors to specify Totnes Quay as a destination in preference to Totnes SDR station, where terminal charges would be levied against the smaller Company. The Great Western Railway The South Devon Railway Company was working the Buckfastleigh line. On 1 February 1876 the SDR amalgamated with the Great Western Railway (GWR) and the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B&ER;); the combined company was named the Great Western Railway. The GWR now assumed the role of working the Buckfastleigh line. Change of gauge The line had been built on the broad gauge, which was the track gauge of the SDR to which it connected at Totnes. In 1892 the Great Western Railway, as successor to the SDR, altered the gauge of its lines in Devon and Cornwall to .The South Devon Railway had obtained Parliamentary authority to do so, including the track of the Buckfastleigh company, in 1875. The work was actually carried out over the weekend 20–23 May 1892, from which time the Buckfastleigh line was a standard gauge line. Financial difficulties The company had never been in good financial health, and the situation seems to have deteriorated after the initial years. By 1896 it was obvious that the company could not continue, and a liquidator was appointed pending sale. The GWR was the only possible purchaser, and the sale took effect on 1 July 1897.Kingdom refers to this as an amalgamation, but it was clearly a forced sale. The shareholders received £22,450 for their £130,000 investment. The GWR assumed the obligations of the debentures and preference share guarantees. Under the GWR The line had been saved by the GWR and indeed some improvement to it passenger carryings took place in the years up to the beginning of World War I. The GWR introduced its railmotor services for passenger trains on the branch, and later push and pull trains (often called auto-trains), in both cases reducing operating costs somewhat. However Newton Abbot became increasingly the commercial centre in the locality, and Totnes lost importance. As road transport—for passengers as well as goods—became available the short road journey to Newton Abbot was decisive for most purposes and the line's traffic declined. The small-scale traditional industries of Buckfastleigh and Ashburton were now obsolescent and their potential railway traffic declined with them. Passenger tickets issued at Ashburton declined from 24,688 in 1903 to 13,851 in 1923 and 4,843 in 1933. Nationalisation—and closure The Transport Act 1947 brought most of the railways of Great Britain into national ownership under British Railways. This had little impact on the operational circumstances of the line, but the decline in usage became increasingly obvious. The decision was taken to close the line to passengers, and the last ordinary passenger train ran on 3 November 1958. Goods traffic on the line continued until Friday 7 September 1962. The following day the final revenue train ran, an enthusiasts' special passenger train. The main line was now closed. However the Quay line served numerous industrial premises and remained in occasional use; it closed for general goods on 14 June 1965, and the service to the private sidings finished after 4 December 1967. Reopening It was re-opened as the \\"Dart Valley Railway\\", a heritage railway, on 5 April 1969, the opening ceremony being performed by Dr Richard Beeching.Beeching had become notorious in railway circles for the Beeching cuts, in which many passenger routes in Great Britain were closed; however the Ashburton line closed several years before Beeching entered the railway industry. In 1971 the line beyond Buckfastleigh was again closed and the A38 road was built on the route of the railway. The South Devon Railway Trust took over the running of the line on 1 January 1991. Stations * Ashburton; the terminus had an all-over train shed, covering the passenger platform and the run-round road, which in the twentieth century had a platform face for goods and cattle. Ashburton had an engine shed and a turntable until 1900. * Buckfastleigh * Staverton * Totnes; branch trains used the main line platforms, no bay platform ever having been constructed. Since the line re-opened as a heritage railway, a new Totnes (Riverside) railway station has been opened to avoid the need for trains to run into the Network Rail station. A footbridge over the river links the two stations. Staverton station was named Staverton Bridge when it reopened in April 1969, but the suffix \\"fell into disuse\\" in the 1980s. Operations Passenger trains arriving from Ashburton used the down platform at Totnes, and departing passenger trains to Ashburton used the up platform. In post-war operation, the first auto-train from Totnes to Ashburton started from the Down platform at Totnes, but could not convey passengers as there was no locking on the crossover from that platform. The 1954 Service Timetable shows eight daily return passenger trips, and a goods train each way. Buckfastleigh had a crossing loop, but the loop line was for goods trains only and was not a running line. Staverton was an intermediate block post but not a staff station. Gradients The line climbed steadily from Totnes to Ashburton, with gentle gradients as far as Staverton, then stiffening to 1 in 264 and 1 in 118; after Buckfastleigh the gradients become considerable, at 1 in 62 typically.

Environmentalism, closely related to behaviorism, is the opposite view, that children acquire cognitive skills and behaviors from their surroundings and environment. Psychologists have studied the development of infants through various topics and have found support for both maturation and environmentalism. Two of the most commonly studied topics are: i) infant crawling and ii) infant language learning. Psychologists have found evidence supporting both the maturation theory and environmentalism theory when investigating each of these topics.  Infant crawling  This video clip shows a visual cliff made for rats. The checkered material is the shallow area. The area not containing the checkered material is the deep area. Rats crossing this boundary experience the illusion of a drop in height. One of the most common apparatus used by psychologists to study infant crawling is the visual cliff. This cliff was first used with different types of animals as well as infants to measure depth perception. Organisms are placed on a raised glass board. Under the glass, material is placed to give the effect of a floor on one side of the apparatus. On the other side, the material is taken away to give the effect of a drop, and a deep side. When infants are placed on this apparatus, psychologists can study whether or not these infants, or other animals, have gained the skills needed to understand that the visual drop is dangerous, or if they still cross the drop point. If young infants can avoid the experimental drop while crawling, researchers can assume that the aversion to cliffs is innately learned, not learned through crawling experience or teaching.  Arguments for maturation  In one study, it was found that the age an infant begins crawling, and not the crawling experience of an infant, determined whether they would cross or avoid the visual cliff. The infants with a later crawling start date avoided the cliff significantly more than infants with an earlier crawling start date. These observations indicate that there is a biological time clock that is intuitively teaching infants about depth avoidance, rather than crawling experience teaching them about avoidance. These conclusions are consistent with maturation theory. In another study, psychologists found that the crawling experience negatively affected infants who could not yet walk and were placed in walkers on the virtual cliff. In this study too, the age when crawling began was a better indicator of whether the infant would avoid the cliff rather than his or her crawling experience. This lends evidence to the theory of maturation and innate age related steps in development, rather than external factors.  Arguments for environmentalism  Studies using a real water visual cliff found that infants with greater crawling experience had an easier time avoiding the cliff than those with less experience. A water cliff is a visual cliff with water in the deep end of the apparatus, and can measure an infant's potential perception of danger, as well as sensitivity to water. The results indicating that crawling experience was a greater indicator of avoidance align with the environmentalism theory in that infants learn through experiences with their environment. Additionally, researchers have also observed that infants who have learnt avoidance through crawling carried this avoidance over to when they start walking, rather than having to relearn these skills. These carryover effects indicate that infants are learning and processing through interactions with their environment and can apply their learnings to other new situations.  Mixed results  It has also been observed that a mother's emotions, seen through facial expression, can sometimes regulate an infant's behavior. Infants were placed on a visual cliff with a clear drop, and were able to see their mothers' facial expressions. When the mothers expressed fear, fewer infants crossed the cliff, indicating that the mothers' expressions had an effect on their behavior, supporting the environmentalism theory. However, when infants were placed on a visual cliff with a hidden drop, many infants crossed regardless of their mothers' facial expressions. This lends credence to the maturation theory; infants innately understand crawling and do not take cues from their surroundings.  Language learning  While specific alphabets, grammar, and sounds might differ in different regions of the world, language is a universal form of communication within all societies, with all infants learning how to speak early in their lives. However, there has been much debate on how children acquire their language skills. More specifically, psychologists have argued about whether the skills of learning a language are innate within all humans, consistent with the maturation theory, or are learned through societal teaching practices, consistent with the theory of environmentalism.  Arguments for maturation  Infants are usually thought to be quick language learners, as people believe that children have implicit abilities to learn languages, whereas adults learning a language must use explicit instruction to obtain proficiency. However, it was found that if given explicit instructions, both children and adults learn new languages effectively. This finding endorse the reasoning that children have inherent abilities to learn languages that are not influenced by the environment. However, these inherent abilities to learn languages can be developed into even stronger skills with help from the environment.  Arguments for environmentalism  One way to examine the potential effect of the environment on the language abilities of children is to study the effects of day care environments on language learning skills. If young children spend a significant portion of their formative years in day care, and if the environment influences their ability to learn language, then there should be a correlation between the quality of day care and language abilities. Psychologists studying this relationship found that the quality of day cares, as well as the language skills of the day care providers are large predictors of children's language ability. Children in higher quality day care locations had much stronger language abilities. This evidence strongly supports the environmental theory that argues factors in a child's environment affect their development and language abilities. Additionally, the longer an infant or child experiences better care during their formative years, the stronger its language skills will be. Parent's responsiveness to children can also help facilitate language and vocabulary growth.  Environmentalism and behavioral interventions  In children with language development problems and behavioral disorders, parent behavioral interventions and speech therapy interventions have also been shown to significantly improve language development in young children. Parental influence can change and dictate young children language skills, an improvement that would not be seen from just internal maturation factors alone.

Protostega skeletal reconstruction in the Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center, Woodland Park, Colorado  Discovery and History  Protostegids family locations The first known Protostega specimen (YPM 1408) was collected on July 4 by the 1871 Yale College Scientific Expedition, close to Fort Wallace and about 5 months before Cope arrived in Kansas. However the fossil that they found was never described or named. It wasn't until E. D. Cope found and collected the first specimen of Protostega gigas in the Kansas chalk in 1871. A variety of bones were found in yellow cretaceous chalk from a bluff near Butte Creek.  Paleoenvironment  The Late Cretaceous was marked by high temperatures, with large epicontinental seaways. During the Mid-to Late Cretaceous period the Western Interior Seaway covered the majority of North America and would connect to the Boreal and Tethyan oceans at times. Within these regions are where the fossil of Protostega gigas have been found. Pencil restoration  Description  Protostega is known to have reached up to 3 meters in length. Cope' s Protostega gigas discovery reveled that their shell had a reduction of ossification that helped these huge animals with streamlining in the water and weight reduction. The carapace was greatly reduced and the disk only extending less than half way towards the distal ends of the ribs. Cope described other greatly modified bones in his specimen including an extremely long coracoid process that reached all the way to the pelvis and a humerus that resembled a Dermochelys. Creating better movement of their limbs. Body structure of fossilized ProtostegaSkull Structure: Edward Cope described the uniqued Protostega gigas to have a large jugal that reached to the quadrate along with a thickened pterygoid that reached to the mandibular articulating surface of the quadrate. The fossil featured a reduction in the posterior portion of the vomer where the palatines meet medially. Another fossilized specimen showed a bony extension, that would have been viewed as a beak, was lacking in the Protostega genus. The premaxillary beak was very shorted then Archelon. In front of the orbital region was elongated with broadly roofed temporal region. The jaws of the fossil showed a large crushing -surfaces. The quadrato-jugal was triangular with a posterior edge that was concave and the entire bone was convex from distal view. The squamosal appeared to have a concave formation on the surface at the upper end of the quadrate. In Cope's fossil the mandible was preserved almost perfectly and from this he recorded that the jaw was very similar to the Chelonidae and the dentary had a broad for above downward with a concave surface, marked by deep pits in the dentary. Cope concluded that these animals were most likely omnivores and consumed a diet of hard shelled crustacean creatures, due to the long symphysis of its lower jaw. Along with probably consisted of seaweed and jellyfish or scavenged on floating carcasses as well, like modern turtles.  Classification  The classification of Protostega was complicated at best. The specimen that Cope discovered in Kansas was hard to evaluate with the preservation condition. The fossil shared many characteristics with two other recored genus named Dermochelys and Chelonidae. Cope wrote about the characteristics that distinctly separated this particular species from the two controversial groups. The differences he described were that the fossil had a reduced or lacking amount of dermal ossification on the back, the articulation of the pterygoid and quadrates, presplenial bone in the jaw was present, no articular process on the back side of the nuchal, simple formation of the radial process on the humerus and a peculiar bent formation of the xiphiplastra. He concluded that genus Protostega and species Protostega gigas was an intermediate form of the two groups Dermochelys and Chelonidae.

History The station as the terminus of the Dart Valley Railway in 1969. Ashburton station, along with the rest of the branch from Totnes, was opened by the Buckfastleigh, Totnes and South Devon Railway on 1 May 1872. The railway was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway in 1897 and this in turn was nationalised into British Railways on 1 January 1948. The station closed to passengers in November 1958 although goods traffic on the line continued until 7 September 1962. The station was briefly re-opened by the Dart Valley Railway, a heritage railway, on 5 April 1969 following which occasional works trains operated but the station was closed finally in 1971 when the track bed between Ashburton and Buckfastleigh was needed for improvements to the A38 road. The South Devon Railway, a successor to the Dart Valley Railway, still operates the remainder of the branch between Totnes and Buckfastleigh. The site today The station used as a garage The station buildings with the important overall roof and the nearby goods shed both still stand as reminders of the town's railway past. In 2014/15, the planners within the Dartmoor National Park Authority (DPNA) working with Teignbridge District Council (TDC - the managing local government authority), recommended that the residual trackbed within the town, together with the area surrounding the station - a total of - be designated for redevelopment under the Chuley Road Masterplan. In their final Masterplan, issued in 2015, the former trackbed up to and including land close to the former station site were proposed to be used for developing housing, a supermarket and light industrial units. The \\"Friends of Ashburton Station\\" (FoAS), backed by the South Devon Railway Trust (SDRT), successfully legally challenged the Masterplan, with the courts decreeing that the plan had to return to draft status, as it had not been fully consulted on by local residents. FoAS and the SDRT are now working on a £20M proposal to eventually return heritage railway services to the unique station, whilst in the short term using the site for local arts, educational and training initiatives. Following further investigations, DNPA and TDC have presently formally withdrawn the Masterplan, although they presently will consider individual planning applications within the designated Chuley Road site, on their individual basis and within the existing local planning map of TDC.

It is the southern terminus of the South Devon Railway, a steam operated heritage railway. Littlehempston station should not be confused with the Totnes main line station on the National Rail Exeter to Plymouth line, which is a walk away. Description Totnes (Riverside) station is located on the east bank of the River Dart, adjacent to the main line railway. Although less than one mile from the centre of the town of Totnes, the surroundings are rural. A footpath and footbridge over the river form the only non-rail land access to the station, although a small jetty allows a water taxi to link the station with the centre of the town at some states of the tide. The station has a single main platform, with a locomotive run round loop and a bay platform. The station building accommodates a booking office, whilst a rail van in the bay platform contains a small exhibition. A rail connection permits special trains to run directly between the South Devon line and the main line railway station. At the Buckfastleigh end of the station is a signal box and a level crossing, which provides the only access to the adjacent Totnes Rare Breeds Farm. History Prior to its preservation as a heritage railway, what is now the South Devon Railway was originally a branch line connecting Totnes to and . Branch line trains joined the main line at Ashburton Junction adjacent to the current site of Riverside station, crossed the railway bridge over the River Dart and terminated in the main line railway station. When the line was first re-opened as a heritage line in 1969, the owners were unable to reach an agreement with British Rail for their trains to run into the main line railway station. Initially push-pull trains were used, controlled from an autocoach at one or both ends, and reversing just short of the junction. However eventually land adjacent to the junction was acquired, and a loop constructed in 1977; a platform was added a few years later but there was no public route between the station and Totnes. At this time it appeared in the timetable as \\"Totnes Riverside\\". Visitors to the railway arriving by main line train had to catch a bus from Totnes to Buckfastleigh from where they could ride the train to Totnes and back, then return to Totnes by bus. To avoid confusion to passengers expecting to be able to board heritage trains at Totnes, the station was renamed \\"Littlehempston Riverside\\" in the 1980s. At the same time a station building was located at Toller station on the Bridport branch, and re-erected at Littlehempston. British Rail allowed heritage line trains into the main line station in 1985, and for three years regular services were run into that station. However the charges levied for use of the station proved not to be cost effective and so the trains eventually returned to using Littlehempston in 1988. In 1993 a new footbridge was built alongside the existing railway bridge, thus providing public access to the station from the town of Totnes and the main line railway station. With this the station was renamed again to \\"Totnes (Littlehempston)\\", but in 2017 this was changed again to \\"Totnes (Riverside)\\". Services The station is served by trains on all operating days of the South Devon Railway. Trains operate daily from late March to the end of October. On most days a single train set operates, providing four journeys a day in each direction. On busy days two train sets may operate, providing more journeys.

Recognition of independence Proclamation of independence 250px The United States of America granted independence to the Philippines on July 4, 1946. In accordance with the Philippine Independence Act (more popularly known as the \\"Tydings–McDuffie Act\\"), President Harry S. Truman issued Proclamation 2695 of July 4, 1946 officially recognizing the independence of the Philippines. On the same day, representatives of the United States of America and of the Republic of the Philippines signed a Treaty of General Relations between the two governments. The treaty provided for the recognition of the independence of the Republic of the Philippines as of July 4, 1946, and the relinquishment of American sovereignty over the Philippine Islands. The U.S. retained dozens of military bases, including a few major ones. In addition, independence was qualified by legislation passed by the U.S. Congress. For example, the Bell Trade Act provided a mechanism whereby U.S. import quotas might be established on Philippine articles which \\"are coming, or are likely to come, into substantial competition with like articles the product of the United States\\". It further required U.S. citizens and corporations be granted equal access to Philippine minerals, forests, and other natural resources. In hearings before the Senate Committee on Finance, Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs William Clayton described the law as \\"clearly inconsistent with the basic foreign economic policy of this country\\" and \\"clearly inconsistent with our promise to grant the Philippines genuine independence.\\" The Philippine government had little choice but to accept these terms for independence. Congress was threatening to withhold post-World War II rebuilding funds unless the Bell Act was ratified. The Philippine Congress obliged on July 2, 1946.H.W. Brands, Bound to Empire: The United States and the Philippines (1992) pp 219–23. After independence, the US continued to direct the country through Central Intelligence Agency operatives like Edward Lansdale. As Raymond Bonner and other historians note, Lansdale controlled the career of President Ramon Magsaysay, going so far as to physically beat him when the Philippine leader delivered a speech written by a Filipino and that American agents also drugged sitting President Elpidio Quirino and discussed assassinating Senator Claro Recto. Prominent Filipino historian Roland G. Simbulan has called the CIA \\"US imperialism's clandestine apparatus in the Philippines.\\" Independence Day shifted The Philippines currently celebrates its Independence Day on June 12, the anniversary of Emilio Aguinaldo's declaration of independence from Spain in 1898. The declaration was not recognised by the United States which, after defeating the Spanish in the Battle of Manila Bay in May that year, acquired the Philippine Islands via the Treaty of Paris that ended the Spanish–American War. From 1946 to 1961, the Philippines observed Independence Day on July 4. On May 12, 1962, President Macapagal issued Presidential Proclamation No. 28 proclaiming June 12, 1962 as a special public holiday throughout the Philippines. In 1964, Republic Act No. 4166 changed the date of Independence Day from July 4 to June 12 and renamed the July 4 holiday as Philippine Republic Day.  The Roxas Administration (1946–1948) Manuel Roxas, president from 1946–1948 When the Congress of the Philippines was convened in 1945, the legislators elected in 1941 chose Manuel Roxas as Senate President. In the Philippine national elections of 1946, Roxas ran for president as the nominee of the liberal wing of the Nacionalista Party. He had the staunch support of General MacArthur. His opponent was Sergio Osmeña, who refused to campaign, saying that the Filipino people knew his reputation. In the April 23, 1946 election, Roxas won 54 percent of the vote, and the Liberal Party won a majority in the legislature. When the Philippines gained independence from the United States on July 4, 1946, Roxas became the first president of the new republic. Although Roxas was successful in getting rehabilitation funds from the United States after independence, he was forced to concede military bases (23 of which were leased for 99 years), trade restrictions for the Philippine citizens, and special privileges for U.S. property owners and investors. His administration was marred by graft and corruption; moreover, the abuses of the provincial military police contributed to the rise of the left-wing Hukbalahap (Huk) movement in the countryside. His heavy-handed attempts to crush the Huks led to widespread peasant disaffection. During Roxas' term of office administration of the Turtle Islands and Mangsee Islands was transferred by the United Kingdom to the Republic of the Philippines. By an international treaty concluded in 1930 between the United States (in respect of its then overseas territory, the Philippine Archipelago) and the United Kingdom (in respect of its then protectorate, the State of North Borneo) the two powers agreed the international boundaries between those respective territories.Convention between the United States and the United Kingdom done at Washington on 2 January 1930 In that treaty the United Kingdom also accepted that the Turtle Islands as well as the Mangsee Islands were part of the Philippines Archipelago and therefore under US sovereignty. However, by a supplemental international treaty concluded at the same time, the two powers agreed that those islands, although part of the Philippines Archipelago, would remain under the administration of the State of North Borneo's British North Borneo Company.Exchange of Notes between the United States and the United Kingdom done at Washington on 2 January 1930 The supplemental treaty provided that the British North Borneo Company would continue to administer those islands unless and until the United States government gave notice to the United Kingdom calling for administration of the islands to be transferred to the U.S. The U.S. never gave such a notice. On the 4th of July, 1946, the Republic of the Philippines was born. It became the successor to the U.S. under the treaties of 1930. On July 15, 1946, the United Kingdom annexed the State of North Borneo and, in the view of the United Kingdom, became the sovereign power with respect to what had been the State of North Borneo.The North Borneo Cession Order in Council 1946 On September 19, 1946, the Republic of the Philippines notified the United Kingdom that it wished to take over the administration of the Turtle Islands, Tawi Tawi and the Mangesse Islands. Pursuant to a supplemental international agreement, the transfer of administration became effective on October 16, 1947. Roxas did not stay long in office because of a heart attack as he was speaking at Clark Air Base on April 15, 1948. He was succeeded by his vice president Elpidio Quirino.Philippine presidents \\" Manuel A. Roxas, Malacañang Museum (archived from the original on July 29, 2008). The Quirino Administration (1948–1953) Elpidio Quirino, president from 1948–1953 Quirino assumed the presidency on April 17, 1948, taking his oath of office two days after the death of Manuel Roxas. In 1949 the wartime president, Jose P. Laurel of the Nacionalista Party, ran against Quirino in what has been described as a particularly corrupt and venal exercise in democracy. Although historians in general accept that Laurel was elected, he refused to challenge Quirino's declared victory with force. Since Quirino was a widower, his surviving daughter Vicky would serve as the official hostess and perform the functions traditionally ascribed to the First Lady. Quirino's administration faced a serious threat in the form of the communist Hukbalahap movement. Though the Huks originally had been an anti-Japanese guerrilla army in Luzon, communists steadily gained control over the leadership, and when Quirino's negotiation with Huk commander Luis Taruc broke down in 1948, Taruc openly declared himself a Communist and called for the overthrow of the government. His six years as president were marked by notable postwar reconstruction, general economic gains, and increased economic aid from the United States. Basic social problems, however, particularly in the rural areas, remained unsolved, and his administration was tainted by widespread graft and corruption. In 1950, the administration of president Quirino was beginning the Korean War and over 7,450 Filipino soldiers were sent to Korea under the designation of the Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea or PEFTOK. Although ill, Quirino ran for re-election in 1953, but he was overwhelmingly defeated by Ramon Magsaysay. The Magsaysay Administration (1953–1957) Ramon Magsaysay, president from 1953–1957 In the Election of 1953, Magsaysay was elected president over the incumbent Elpidio Quirino, with the scarcely concealed help of American officials and funds. He was sworn into office wearing the Barong Tagalog, a first by a Philippine president. As president, he was a close friend and supporter of the United States and a vocal spokesman against communism during the Cold War. He led the foundation of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization also known as the Manila Pact of 1954, that aimed to defeat Marxist-Leninist movements in Southeast Asia, South Asia and Oceania. During his term, he made Malacañang Palace literally a \\"house of the people\\", opening its gates to the public.Jose Veloso Abueva, Ramon Magsaysay: A political biography (Solidaridad Publishing House, 1971). One example of his integrity followed a demonstration flight aboard a new plane belonging to the Philippines Air Force (PAF). President Magsaysay asked what the operating costs per hour were for that type of aircraft, then wrote a personal check to the PAF, covering the cost of his flight. On March 16, 1957 Magsaysay left Manila for Cebu City where he spoke at three educational institutions. That same night, at about 1 a.m., he boarded the presidential plane \\"Mt. Pinatubo\\", a C-47, heading back to Manila. In the early morning hours of March 17, his plane was reported missing. It was late in the afternoon that day that newspapers reported that the airplane had crashed on Mt. Manunggal in Cebu and that 25 of the 26 passengers and crew aboard were killed. Only newspaperman Néstor Mata survived. Vice President Carlos P. García, who was on an official visit to Australia at the time, assumed the presidency to serve out the last eight months of Magsaysay's term. An estimated 2 million people attended Magsaysay's burial on March 22, 1957. See the SIL International Website at: Establishing the Work in Mexico.Carlos P. Romulo and Marvin M. Gray: The Magsaysay Story (The John Day Company, 1956, updated – with an additional chapter on Magsaysay's death – re-edition by Pocket Books, Special Student Edition, SP-18, December 1957) The Garcia Administration (1957–1961) Carlos P. Garcia, president from 1957–1961 Garcia assumed the presidency after Ramón Magsaysay died in a plane crash on March 17, 1957, and was elected later the same year, in the Election 1957, to a full term.Martin Meadows, \\"Philippine political parties and the 1961 election.\\" Pacific Affairs 35.3 (1962): 261–274. During his administration, he acted on the Bohlen–Serrano Agreement which shortened the lease of the US Bases from 99 years to 25 years and made it renewable after every five years. He was well known when he exercised the Filipino First policy during his term in office. This policy heavily favored Filipino businessmen over foreign investors. He was also responsible for changes in retail trade which greatly affected the Chinese businessmen in the country. He also made a program focused on thriftiness. At the end of his second term, he ran for re–election in the Election 1961 in November 1961, but was defeated by Diosdado Macapagal, who served as Vice- President under him, but belonged to the opposing Liberal Party — in the Philippines the President and the Vice-President are elected separately. The Macapagal Administration (1961–1965) Diosdado Macapagal, president from 1961–1965 In the 1961 presidential election, Macapagal ran against Garcia and defeated the incumbent president by a 55% to 45% margin. Seeking to stimulate economic development, Macapagal took the advice of supporters and allowed the Philippine peso to float on the free currency exchange market. His reform efforts were blocked by the Nacionalistas, who dominated the House of Representatives and the Senate at that time. Nonetheless, his presidency achieved growth and prosperity for the nation.Martin Meadows, \\"Philippine political parties and the 1961 election.\\" Pacific Affairs 35.3 (1962): 261–274. Among the most significant achievements of Macapagal as president were the abolition of tenancy and accompanying land reform program in the Agricultural Land Reform Code of 1963. He also changed the date of celebration of Philippine independence from July 4 to June 12, the latter date having been the day when in 1898, Emilio Aguinaldo declared independence from Spain). Later, Macapagal told author Stanley Karnow that the reason for the change was that American Embassy celebrations were visited more than the Filipino reception on the July 4 American independence day. Macapagal was defeated for re-election in 1965 by Senate President Ferdinand Marcos, a former Liberal Party ally who defected to the Nacionalista party to challenge the incumbent President.

The Marcos era includes the final years of the Third Republic (1965–1972), the Philippines under martial law (1972–1981), and the majority of the Fourth Republic (1981–1986). By its end, the country was experiencing a debt crisis, extreme poverty, and severe underemployment. The Marcos administration (1965–1972) First term Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos with Lyndon B. Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson during a visit to the United States. In 1965, Ferdinand Marcos won the presidential election and became the 10th President of the Philippines. His first term was marked with increased industrialization and the creation of solid infrastructures nationwide, such as the North Luzon Expressway and the Maharlika Highway. Marcos did this by appointing a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats and intellectuals, by increasing funding to the Armed Forces and mobilizing them to help in construction. Marcos also established schools and learning institutions nationwide, more than the combined total of those established by his predecessors. In 1968, Senator Benigno S. Aquino Jr. warned that Marcos was on the road to establishing \\"a garrison state\\" by \\"ballooning the armed forces budget\\", saddling the defense establishment with \\"overstaying generals\\" and \\"militarizing our civilian government offices\\". These were prescient comments in the light of events that would happen in the following decade. Marcos also sent 10,450 Filipino soldiers to Vietnam during his term, under the PHILCAG (Philippine Civic Action Group). Fidel Ramos, who was later to become the 12th President of the Philippines in 1992, was a part of this expeditionary force. Second term In 1969, Marcos ran for a second term (allowable under the 1935 constitution then in effect), and won against 11 other candidates. Marcos' second term was marked by economic turmoil brought about by factors both external and internal, a restless student body who demanded educational reforms, a rising crime rate, and a growing Communist insurgency, among other things. Ferdinand Marcos, president from 1965–1986. At one point, student activists took over the Diliman campus of the University of the Philippines and declared it a free commune, which lasted for a while before the government dissolved it. Violent protesting continued over the next few years until the declaration of martial law in 1972. The event was popularly known as the First Quarter Storm. During the First Quarter Storm in 1970, the line between leftist activists and communists became increasingly blurred, as a significant number of Kabataang Makabayan ('KM') advanced activists joined the party of the Communist Party also founded by Jose Maria Sison. KM members protested in front of Congress, throwing a coffin, a stuffed alligator, and stones at Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos after his State of the Nation Address. On the presidential palace, activists rammed the gate with a fire truck and once the gate broke and gave way, the activists charged into the Palace grounds tossing rocks, pillboxes and Molotov cocktails. In front of the US embassy, protesters vandalized, burned, and damaged the embassy lobby resulting in a strong protest from the U.S. Ambassador. The KM protests ranged from 50,000 to 100,000 in number per weekly mass action. In the aftermath of the January 1970 riots, at least two activists were confirmed dead and several were injured by the police. The mayor of Manila at the time, Antonio Villegas, commended the Manila Police District for their \\"exemplary behavior and courage\\" and protecting the First Couple long after they have left. The death of the activists was seized by the Lopez controlled Manila Times and Manila Chronicle, blaming Marcos and added fire to the weekly protests. Students declared a week-long boycott of classes and instead met to organize protest rallies. Rumors of a coup d'état were also brewing. A report of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee said that shortly after the 1969 Philippine presidential election, a group composed mostly of retired colonels and generals organized a revolutionary junta to first discredit President Marcos and then kill him. As described in a document given to the committee by Philippine Government official, key figures in the plot were Vice President Fernando Lopez and Sergio Osmena Jr., whom Marcos defeated in the 1969 election. Marcos even went to the U.S. embassy to dispel rumors that the U.S. embassy is supporting a coup d'état which the opposition liberal party was spreading. While the report obtained by the NY Times speculated saying that story could be used by Marcos to justify Martial Law, as early as December 1969 in a message from the U.S. Ambassador to the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, the U.S. Ambassador said that most of the talk about revolution and even assassination has been coming from the defeated opposition, of which Adevoso (of the Liberal Party) is a leading activist. He also said that the information he has on the assassination plans are 'hard' or well-sourced and he has to make sure that it reached President Marcos. In light of the crisis, Marcos wrote an entry in his diary in January 1970: \\"I have several options. One of them is to abort the subversive plan now by the sudden arrest of the plotters. But this would not be accepted by the people. Nor could we get the Huks (Communists), their legal cadres and support. Nor the MIM (Maoist International Movement) and other subversive [or front] organizations, nor those underground. We could allow the situation to develop naturally then after massive terrorism, wanton killings and an attempt at my assassination and a coup d’etat, then declare martial law or suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus – and arrest all including the legal cadres. Right now I am inclined towards the latter.\\" Plaza Miranda bombing On August 21, 1971, the Liberal Party held a campaign rally at the Plaza Miranda to proclaim their Senatorial bets and their candidate for the Mayoralty of Manila. Two grenades were reportedly tossed on stage, injuring almost everybody present. As a result, Marcos suspended the writ of habeas corpus to arrest those behind the attack. He rounded up a list of supposed suspects, Escabas, and other undesirables to eliminate rivals in the Liberal Party. Marcos accused the communist movement as the perpetrators of the bombing, and responded by suspending the writ of habeas corpus. Declassified documents from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency also implicate Marcos in at least one of the deadly series of bombings in 1971. Martial law (1972–1981) On September 23, 1972, then-Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile was ambushed while en route home. This assassination attempt (reproducing news article reprints) together with the general citizen disquiet, were used by Marcos as reasons to issue Presidential Proclamation No. 1081, proclaiming a state of martial law in the Philippines on September 21.Presidential Proclamation No. 1081 , September 21, 1972, Proclaiming a State of Martial Law in the Philippines, The LawPhil Project. The assassination attempt was widely believed to have been staged; Enrile himself admitted to the assassination attempt to have been staged but he would later retract his claim. Rigoberto Tiglao, former press secretary and a former communist incarcerated during the martial law, argued that the liberal and communist parties provoked martial law imposition. Enrile said that \\"The most significant event that made President Marcos decide to declare martial law was the MV Karagatan incident on July 1972. It was the turning point. The MV Karagatan involved the infiltration of high powered rifles, ammunition, 40-millimeter rocket launchers, rocket projectiles, communications equipment, and other assorted war materials by the CPP-NPA-NDF on the Pacific side of Isabela in Cagayan Valley.\\" The weapons were shipped from Communist China which at that time was exporting the communist revolution and supported the NPA's goal to overthrow the government. Marcos, who thereafter ruled by decree, curtailed press freedom and other civil liberties, abolished Congress, controlled media establishments, and ordered the arrest of opposition leaders and militant activists, including his staunchest critics Senators Benigno Aquino Jr. and Jose W. Diokno, virtually turning the Philippines into a totalitarian dictatorship with Marcos as its Supreme Leader. Initially, the declaration of martial law was well received, given the social turmoil of the period. Crime rates decreased significantly after a curfew was implemented. Political opponents were allowed to go into exile. As martial law went on for the next nine years, the excesses committed by the military increased. In total, there were 3,257 extrajudicial killings, 35,000 individual tortures, and 70,000 were incarcerated. It is also reported that 737 Filipinos disappeared between 1975 and 1985. Though it was claimed that Martial law was no military take-over of the government, the immediate reaction of some sectors of the nation was of astonishment and dismay, for even though it was claimed that the gravity of the disorder, lawlessness, social injustice, youth and student activism, and other disturbing movements had reached a point of peril, they felt that martial law over the whole country was not yet warranted. Worse, political motivations were ascribed to be behind the proclamation, since the then constitutionally non-extendable term of President Marcos was about to expire. This suspicion became more credible when opposition leaders and outspoken anti-government media people were immediately placed under indefinite detention in military camps and other unusual restrictions were imposed on travel, communication, freedom of speech and the press, etc. In a word, the martial law regime was anathema to no small portion of the populace. It was in the light of the above circumstances and as a means of solving the dilemma aforementioned that the concept embodied in Amendment No. 6 was born in the Constitution of 1973. In brief, the central idea that emerged was that martial law might be earlier lifted, but to safeguard the Philippines and its people against any abrupt dangerous situation which would warrant the some exercise of totalitarian powers, the latter must be constitutionally allowed, thereby eliminating the need to proclaim martial law and its concomitants, principally the assertion by the military of prerogatives that made them appear superior to the civilian authorities below the President. In other words, the problem was what may be needed for national survival or the restoration of normalcy in the face of a crisis or an emergency should be reconciled with the popular mentality and attitude of the people against martial law. (note 29) In a speech before his fellow alumni of the University of the Philippines College of Law, President Marcos declared his intention to lift martial law by the end of January 1981. The reassuring words for the skeptic came on the occasion of the University of the Philippines law alumni reunion on December 12, 1980 when the President declared: \\"We must erase once and for all from the public mind any doubts as to our resolve to bring martial law to an end and to minister to an orderly transition to parliamentary government.\\" The apparent forthright irrevocable commitment was cast at the 45th anniversary celebration of the Armed Forces of the Philippines on December 22, 1980 when the President proclaimed: \\"A few days ago, following extensive consultations with a broad representation of various sectors of the nation and in keeping with the pledge made a year ago during the seventh anniversary of the New Society, I came to the firm decision that martial law should be lifted before the end of January, 1981, and that only in a few areas where grave problems of public order and national security continue to exist will martial law continue to remain in force.\\" After the lifting of martial law, power remained concentrated with Marcos. One scholar noted how Marcos retained \\"all martial law decrees, orders, and law-making powers,\\" including powers that allowed him to jail political opponents. Human rights abuses The martial law era under Marcos was marked by plunder, repression, torture, and atrocity. As many as 3,257 were murdered, 35,000 tortured, and 70,000 illegally detained according to estimates by historian Alfred McCoy. One journalist described the Ferdinand Marcos administration as \\"a grisly one-stop shop for human rights abuses, a system that swiftly turned citizens into victims by dispensing with inconvenient requirements such as constitutional protections, basic rights, due process, and evidence.\\" Economy According to World Bank Data, the Philippine's Gross Domestic Product quadrupled from $8 billion in 1972 to $32.45 billion in 1980, for an inflation-adjusted average growth rate of 6% per year. Indeed, according to the U.S. based Heritage Foundation, the Philippines enjoyed its best economic development since 1945 between 1972 and 1980. The economy grew amidst the two severe global oil shocks following the 1973 oil crisis and 1979 energy crisis – oil price was $3 / barrel in 1973 and $39.5 in 1979, or a growth of 1200% which drove inflation. Despite the 1984–1985 recession, GDP on a per capita basis more than tripled from $175.9 in 1965 to $565.8 in 1985 at the end of Marcos' term, though this averages less than 1.2% a year when adjusted for inflation.https://www.nber.org/chapters/c9047.pdf The Heritage Foundation pointed out that when the economy began to weaken 1979, the government did not adopt anti-recessionist policies and instead launched risky and costly industrial projects. The government had a cautious borrowing policy in the 1970s. Amidst high oil prices, high interest rates, capital flight, and falling export prices of sugar and coconut, the Philippine government borrowed a significant amount of foreign debt in the early 1980s. The country's total external debt rose from US$2.3 billion in 1970 to US$26.2 billion in 1985. Marcos' critics charged that policies have become debt-driven, along with corruption and plunder of public funds by Marcos and his cronies. This held the country under a debt-servicing crisis which is expected to be fixed by only 2025. Critics have pointed out an elusive state of the country's development as the period is marred by a sharp devaluing of the Philippine Peso from 3.9 to 20.53. The overall economy experienced a slower growth GDP per capita, lower wage conditions and higher unemployment especially towards the end of Marcos' term after the 1983–1984 recession. The recession was triggered largely by political instability following Ninoy's assassination, high global interest rates, Severe global economic recession, and a significant increase in global oil price, the latter three of which affected all indebted countries in Latin America, Europe, and the Philippines was not exempted. Critics claimed that poverty incidence grew from 41% in the 1960s at the time Marcos took the Presidency to 59% when he was removed from power. The period is sometimes described as a golden age for the country's economy. However, by the period's end, the country was experiencing a debt crisis, extreme poverty, and severe underemployment. On the island of Negros, one- fifth of the children under six were seriously malnourished.  Corruption, plunder, and crony capitalism  The Philippines under martial law suffered from massive and uncontrolled corruption. Some estimates, including that by the World Bank, put the Marcos family's stolen wealth at US$10 billion. Plunder was achieved through the creation of government monopolies, awarding loans to cronies, forced takeover of public and private enterprises, direct raiding of the public treasury, issuance of Presidential decrees that enabled cronies to amass wealth, kickbacks and commissions from businesses, use of dummy corporations to launder money abroad, skimming of international aid, and hiding of wealth in bank accounts overseas. Parliamentary elections The first formal elections since 1969 for an interim Batasang Pambansa (National Assembly) were held on April 7, 1978. Sen. Aquino, then in jail, decided to run as leader of his party, the Lakas ng Bayan party, but they did not win any seats in the Batasan, despite public support and their apparent victory. The night before the elections, supporters of the LABAN party showed their solidarity by setting up a \\"noise barrage\\" in Manila, creating noise the whole night until dawn. The Fourth Republic (1981–1986) The opposition boycotted the June 16, 1981 presidential election, which pitted Marcos and his Kilusang Bagong Lipunan party against retired Gen. Alejo Santos of the Nacionalista Party. Marcos won by a margin of over 16 million votes, which constitutionally allowed him to have another six-year term. Finance Minister Cesar Virata was elected as Prime Minister by the Batasang Pambansa. In 1983, opposition leader Benigno \\"Ninoy\\" Aquino Jr. was assassinated at Manila International Airport upon his return to the Philippines after a long period of exile in the United States. This coalesced popular dissatisfaction with Marcos and began a series of events, including pressure from the United States, that culminated in a snap presidential election on February 7, 1986. The opposition united under Aquino's widow, Corazon Aquino, and Salvador Laurel, head of the United Nationalists Democratic Organizations (UNIDO). The election was marred by widespread reports of violence and tampering with results by both sides. The official election canvasser, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), declared Marcos the winner, despite a walk-out staged by disenfranchised computer technicians on February 9. According to the COMELEC's final tally, Marcos won with 10,807,197 votes to Aquino's 9,291,761 votes. By contrast, the partial 70% tally of NAMFREL, an accredited poll watcher, said Aquino won with 7,835,070 votes to Marcos's 7,053,068.; ^ (showing a reproduction of NAMFREL's announcement of the results). End of the Marcos regime The fraudulent result was not accepted by Aquino and her supporters. International observers, including a U.S. delegation led by Senator Richard Lugar, denounced the official results. General Fidel Ramos and Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile then withdrew their support for the government, defecting and barricading themselves within Camp Crame. This resulted in that peaceful 1986 EDSA Revolution that forced Marcos into exile in Hawaii while Corazon Aquino became the 11th President of the Philippines on February 25, 1986. Under Aquino, the Philippines would adopt a new constitution, ending the Fourth Republic and ushering in the beginning of the Fifth Republic.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 26, 1988 as the Mount Vernon Arsenal-Searcy Hospital Complex. History The Mount Vernon Arsenal was established by the United States Army near the Mobile River, three miles west of Fort Stoddert, and approximately 30 miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico. Along with the Kennebec Arsenal in Augusta, Maine, it is one of the most complete antebellum arsenals surviving to the present day.National Historic Landmark Nomination - Kennebec Arsenal, p.20. Established in 1828 as an ordnance manufacturing base, the Mount Vernon Arsenal served as one of the U.S. Army's main ammunition plants from its inception until the Civil War. On January 4, 1861, troops of the Alabama state militia took possession of the arsenal on the orders of Alabama governor Andrew B. Moore.War of the Rebellion, Vol.I, Chap.III, p.327-328. The takeover from the small US Army force, commanded by Captain Jesse L. Reno, was peaceful and bloodless. After Alabama joined with other seceded states to form the Confederacy, the Arsenal was turned over to the Confederate Army for the duration of the war. In 1862, after the Battle of New Orleans, the Confederacy moved ammunition manufacturing from the Mount Vernon Arsenal to Selma, Alabama. Selma offered a more secure location farther away from Union forces.U.S. War Department, The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, 70 volumes in 4 series. Washington, D.C.: United States Government Printing Office, 1880-1901. The Confederate Army held the Arsenal almost until the end of the Civil War. After the war was over, the Arsenal was returned to the federal government and the site was renamed the Mount Vernon Barracks. From 1887 to 1894 the Barracks was used as a prison for captured Apache people, including Geronimo and his followers. Walter Reed, the United States Army physician who confirmed that yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes, served as post surgeon in the 1880s. In 1895, the site was deeded to the state of Alabama.

Returning to acting after the war, he both narrated and had a small on-screen role in Scrooge (1951); and portrayed the captain of the ship that Katharine Hepburn's and Humphrey Bogart's characters set out to destroy, whom they persuade to marry them just before they are to be executed, in The African Queen (1951). Bull was the first actor to portray Pozzo in the English-language version of Samuel Beckett's Waiting For Godot when it opened on 3 August 1955. Bull's performance as the Soviet Ambassador, Alexi de Sadesky, in Dr Strangelove (1964) is probably the best known of his many film and TV appearances. He was cast as Thwackum, one of Blifil's two tutors, in the 1963 film Tom Jones. (The other tutor, Square, of contrasting build and character, was played by John Moffatt.) In the 1970s, he ran a small shop just off Notting Hill Gate, selling zodiac-related items. Bull wrote a book on the subject of teddy bears, Bear With Me, and a book on his adventures on the Greek islands of Corfu and Paxos (where he owned a house), It isn't all Greek to me, illustrated by Oscar winner Roger Furse. He was also the author of a non-fiction book about his experiences during the Second World War as commander of a Tank Landing Craft (LCT), To Sea in a Sieve. On 20 May 1984, at 72 years of age, Peter Bull died of a heart attack in London.

Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Pages 424 - 425. The clan does not currently have a chief therefore it is considered an Armigerous clan. History Origins The name MacLellan is Scottish Gaelic in origin. It is derived from MacGille Fholain which means son of the servant of St Fillan. St Fillan was a missionary of the old church of Celtic Christianity. There is also a village in Perthshire named after him and the name Fillan is derived from faelchu which means wolf in the Celtic language. The MacLellans were numerous in Galloway, but also possessed a grant of lands in Knapdale, Argyllshire during the early fourteenth century, and are linked by tradition to territories in Perthshire. Perthshire was the centre of devotion to St Fillan, and the first MacLellan on record (not necessarily related to the Galloway family) was Duncan MacLellan who appears on a charter of Alexander II of Scotland in 1217 as a landowner in Strathearn. The marked similarity between the ancient arms of the MacLellans and the Medieval Mormaers of Strathearn (two chevronels on a plain shield) adds to the possibility that the clan may have originated in the Southern Highlands, before attaining land in Galloway in the thirteenth century.http://www.heritagearchaeology.com.au/history-kirkcudbright.html The chiefly line can be traced back to Cane (or Cahan) MacGillolane, a knight and officeholder in the service of the Baliol lords of Galloway in the later thirteenth century. His grandson, Gilbert McGillolane, served as Bishop of Sodor and Man between 1324 and 1327 and was referred to as 'Captain of Clan Connan' - a rendering of Cane MacGillolane's Christian name. The traditions of the Celtic Church diverged from Latin Christendom in rejecting clerical celibacy, and Bishop MacGillolane's son Matthew, sheriff of Galloway under King Robert II, appears to have followed as chief; seemingly the first to use the name 'MacLellan'. The ancestors of Cane MacGillolane are uncertain, and some historians have posited a link with Clan MacMillan, who also had ecclesiastical origins, and also maintained landholdings in Galloway, Perthshire and the Knapdale district of Argyllshire.http://www.clanmacmillan.org/pages/members/septs/cane.html The possibility of a shared origin rests primarily on a possible overlap between the MacGillolane pedigree and the ancient MacMillan genealogy, as given in the MS. 1467. Definitive proof, however, remains lacking. Wars of Scottish Independence MacLellan's Castle During the Wars of Scottish Independence, most of Galloway's leading families backed the Baliol, rather than Bruce claim to the throne of Scotland and, hence, fought against the English in the early years of conflict before gradual submission to Edward I after the collapse of the first phase of resistance under William Wallace. The MacGillolane kindred followed this trajectory, and most of the sons of Cane MacGillolane had chosen to submit to the Plantagenet crown by the end of 1298: their names appearing in various Gaelic or Norman forms as \\"Fitz Cane\\" or \\"Mac Cane\\" in the English diplomatic records. \\"John de Bombie\\" whose lands became the centre of clan territory held out for the longest period, and was among the close followers of Sir William Wallace when he left Kirkcudbright for France after the defeat at the Battle of Falkirk (1298). 15th century and clan conflicts After maintaining forlorn support for the house of Baliol into the mid-fourteenth century, the MacLellans were ushered back into service of the Scottish crown under David II. So successful was their reintegration that during the early 15th century there were reputedly no fewer than fourteen knights in Galloway of the name MacLellan. One of these, Sir Alexander MacLellan was cited by the sixteenth-century historian David Hume of Godscroft (drawing on the monastic Book of Pluscarden) as the Scotsman who slew the duke of Clarence while fighting in French service at the Battle of Baugé in 1421. In the following generation, Sir Patrick MacLellan of Bombie's estates were forfeited as a result of marauding through the lands of the Clan Douglas. However James II of Scotland restored the estates when Sir William MacLellan, son of Sir Patrick captured the leader of a band of gypsies who had been terrorizing the district. William carried the head of the brigand to the king on the point of his sword. This story is one explanation for the MacLellan clan crest, however a Moors' head has also been considered as an allusion to the Crusades. In 1452 Sir Patrick Maclellan of Bombie who was the Sheriff of Galloway was captured by William Douglas, 8th Earl of Douglas. Douglas held MacLellan in Threave Castle for not joining a conspiracy against the king. Sir Patrick's uncle held high royal office and obtained letters ordering Douglas to release his prisoner. However Douglas had Patrick murdered when presented with the royal warrant, whilst he entertained his uncle's son, his cousin, at dinner. There is a tradition that in revenge, the MacLellans used the celebrated Scottish cannon Mons Meg to batter down Threave Castle, of which there is little doubt. 16th century and Anglo-Scottish Wars The family suffered severely during the Anglo-Scottish Wars of the reigns of James IV and James V. Sir William Maclellan of Bombie was knighted by King James IV of Scotland but was killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513 fighting for the king. William's son, Thomas, was killed in Edinburgh at the door of St Giles' Cathedral by Gordon of Lochinvar in 1526. Thomas's younger brother, William Maclellan of Nunton presided over the family as Tutor of Bombie while Thomas's son was in infancy, and mobilised the successful defence of Kirkcudbright against English besiegers in 1547. The younger Thomas Maclellan was killed in the same year at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh. In the following generation, Sir Thomas Maclellan of Bombie fought for Mary, Queen of Scots at the battle of Langside, and prospered subsequently under her son James VI.Sir Andrew Agnew, The Hereditary Sheriffs of Galloway (1893) He served as Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the king, and as provost of Kirkcudbright, constructing Maclellan's Castle as a fashionable gentleman's residence overseeing the town. 17th century and Civil War The private coat of arms of Lord Kirkcudbright,A General and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire; p.44; By John Burke; Published by H.

In 1633 he was raised to the peerage as Lord Kirkcudbright. During the Scottish Civil War the third Lord was such a zealous royalist that he incurred enormous debts in the king’s cause. As a result, the estates were completely ruined. 18th to 19th centuries There were two claimants to the chief's title at the beginning of the 18th century and the dispute was finally settled by the House of Lords in 1761. However the title became dormant again when the ninth Lord died in Bruges in 1832. Castle MacLellan's Castle, found in Kirkcudbright in south-west Scotland was the seat of the chief of Clan MacLellan. The castle's beginnings lie in the Reformation of 1560 which led to the abandonment of the Convent of Greyfriars which had stood on the site now occupied by the castle since 1449. Hebridean MacLellans There are concentrations of MacLellans found in the Western Isles on Uist. The surname borne by these MacLellans is represented by the Gaelic Mac Gille Fhialain, instead of the usual form Mac Gille Fhaolain borne by other MacLellans. The Uist MacLellans were once known collectively as Na Faolanaich. The North Uist MacLellans are also known as Clann Iain Mhóir, after Iain Mór (John Mor MacLellan), a seventeenth-century ancestor. It is possible that this family descends from South Uist MacLellans who migrated to North Uist.

It was built by Cardiff Corporation Waterworks between 1893 and 1897, and the water is impounded by an earth dam with a clay core. Since 1973 it has been owned by Welsh Water. As its name suggests, it is located in the Brecon Beacons National Park in the Powys unitary authority area and within the historic county boundaries of Breconshire. There is access to the Taff Trail from the car park below the dam. History Cardiff Corporation had bought out the Cardiff Waterworks Company in 1879, and in March 1881 asked their Borough Engineer, John Avery Brandon Williams, to produce a report on all possible sources of water for Cardiff, so that they could plan for the future. Williams presented his reports in May and August 1881, suggesting that the best scheme was to impound the waters of the upper Taff Fawr. After consulting the water engineer John Frederick Bateman, who also recommended the Taff Fawr scheme in June 1882 as the one most likely to meet the needs for water at the lowest cost, the Corporation presented a bill to Parliament in November 1883, which was considered by a House of Commons Committee between 1 May and 20 May 1884. It faced serious opposition from riparian landowners and there were 16 petitions against it, but several influential civil engineers was called to give evidence, notably Bateman, Thomas Hawksley James Mansergh, and George H. Hill. J A B Williams, their own Engineer, and the meteorologist George James Symonds also gave evidence, and although it cost the Corporation £3,652 to fight the case, Royal Assent was obtained for the Cardiff Corporation Act 1884 on 7 August. The catchment of the upper Taff Fawr was but it was split into an upper area of and a lower one of . Any works had to provide compensation water to maintain the flow in the Taff Fawr, and working on the upper area first meant that they only had to supply per day of compensation flow until work started on the lower area. Cantref Reservoir, at the time known as Cantreff, was the first to be built, together with a pipeline to Lisvane Reservoir and Llanishen Reservoir and intermediate balancing reservoirs at Blackbrook, Cefn, and Rhubina. Work on the pipeline was completed in September 1888, and on the balancing reservoirs in November 1888. Cantref Reservoir was completed on 14 September 1892, and attention then turned to the highest reservoir in the chain. The 1884 Act had specified that the Beacons Reservoir would have a capacity of but during the detailed planning for the project, Williams found that placing the dam a little higher up the valley would more than double the capacity of the reservoir, and would also provide a solid rock foundation on which to build it. Accordingly, the Corporation went back to Parliament, and the Cardiff Corporation Act 1894 authorised the expanded reservoir, which would have a capacity of . For Cantref Reservoir, a standard gauge railway had been constructed from the main line at Cefn-coed-y-cymmer to the dam site, some to the north. They had started to extend it towards the Beacons site in 1891, and had agreed terms with the landowner, Sir William Lewis, for the existing railway to remain in place for another six years, but in March 1892 a disagreement occurred, and of track were lifted where the railway crossed his land. Most of the extension to Beacons passed through land owned by Lord Tredegar, with whom separate negotiations were taking place. The differences were resolved, and after the Board of Trade approved the new route on 27 April 1893, the lifted track was re-instated, and the track to Beacons was completed, making a railway. Some difficulties had been experienced building the Cantref dam, with two contractors failing to complete the work, which had resulted in the Corporation completing the job by using direct labour. For Beacons, they decided to use direct labour for the whole project, and work began in April 1893, in advance of obtaining the Act of Parliament. The site was remote, and situated around Above Ordnance Datum. By the auturm of 1893, a whole village had been created near the dam site, with sidings and running roads on the railway, workshops for carpenters, a blacksmith's workshop, a boiler house, a fitting shop, a shed for the locomotives, a saw mill, stables for the horses, a wagon shop and accommodation for 335 men. Where possible, buildings had been removed from Cantref and reused, although living quarters for another 85 men remained at Cantref. One unusual item purchased at the time was of -gauge \\"Decauville railway\\", complete with turntables, points and wagons, but its use was never recorded. As with Cantref, stone was obtained from a quarry near Cefn-coed-y-cymmer, close to the private railway, and puddle clay for the central core of the dam was extracted from a field which was part of the Crawshay Brothers ironworks at Cyfarthfa, where a -gauge railway was used to transport the clay to the mainline railway. The busiest period was in 1895-96, when some 500 men were employed. While many were involved in building the dam, others worked on the railway, in the quarry, and at the clay field at Cyfarthfa. February 1896 was the busiest month, when 4,100 tons of clay were excavated and trasferred to the dam site. There were periods where wet weather meant that men did not work on the main construction, and in some cases were laid off until the weather improved. From September 1895, the workmen's train was withdrawn, and despite petitions from the men, the Committee refused to reverse their decision. By Christmas 1896, the main core of the dam was completed, and finishing works were carried on through the spring and summer. The railway yard at Beacons, and the track to below the Cantref dam were removed between March and June 1897, impounding of water began on 17 September, while many of the buildings were dismantled prior to the opening ceremony held on 30 September, when Alderman David Jones presided. The dam consists of an earth embankment with a clay core, which is faced with masonry. A circular valve tower with castellated stonework is located on a masonry platform which projects from the inner face of the dam. The valve tower is offset towards the east side of the dam, and there is a spillway at its eastern edge, crossed by a stone bridge. The length of the dam is and it is tall at its highest point.  Archaeological sites During periods of low water, the remains of longhouses can be seen. One building overlooking the Taff Fawr has foundations of massive weathered slabs. Flint tools have been found.

He perished at the Battle of Little Bighorn, the only black man killed in the fight. Early life and service with the US Army Not much is known of Dorman's early life. Date of births of both 1832 (in Philadelphia, as a freeman) and 1840 exist.http://www.blackpast.org/aaw/dorman-isaiah-1840-1876 Other records suggest that he was a slave in the 1840s in Louisiana to the D'Orman family and may have escaped and gone out West. By 1850, he had settled near Fort Rice in the Dakota Territory, where he supported himself by cutting wood for the garrison. He was on friendly terms with the Indians and probably knew Sitting Bull, according to Evan Connell's bestselling 1985 book Son of the Morning Star.Son of the Morning Star: Custer & the Little Bighorn, by Evan S. Connell, 1984, Promontory Press, p. 24-27 He lived with the Lakota tribe as a trapper and trader in the 1850s and married a young woman of Inkpaduta's band of the Santee Sioux. The Sioux called him 'Azinpi', which translates to '(Buffalo's) Teat', perhaps because his black skin and curly hair reminded them of one. Or perhaps his name, Isaiah, sounded similar to them. There are no known photographs of him, and the only existing descriptions describe him as \\"very big\\" and \\"very black\\". An Indian pictograph of Reno's retreat shows a black man in Army uniform flat on the ground beside a prostrate white horse, with \\"an abnormally thick right thumb.\\"Connell, 24-27 In November 1865, he was hired to carry the mail on a round trip between Forts Rice and Wadsworth for $100 a month - good pay at the time. It is said that he had no horse and walked the entire distance with his sleeping bag over his shoulder and the mail in a waterproof pouch. He did this for about two years.Son of the Morning Star: Custer & the Little Bighorn, by Evan S. Connell, 1984, Promontory Press, p. 24-27 In September 1871, he served as a guide and interpreter for a party of engineers making the Northern Pacific Railroad Survey. He may have accompanied the 7th Cavalry on the 1874 Black Hills Expedition; there are references to Custer's servant 'Isa', which may have been him mistaken by people who didn't know who he was. Dorman during the Battle of the Little Bighorn In the late spring of 1876, George Armstrong Custer hired Dorman as an interpreter for his expedition to the Little Bighorn Country. (At least one report says that Dorman had not started out with the rest of the Montana Column, but had caught up with it at the Rosebud with a message and when he attempted to return to Fort Lincoln, Custer ordered him to remain. However, Custer's request for his assignment still exists and is dated May 14.) On June 25, 1876, Dorman accompanied the detachment of Major Marcus Reno into the battle and was left behind when Reno retired across the river to the high bluffs. According to most accounts as in Connell (1985), he gave a good account of himself- shooting several braves with a non-regulation sporting rifle. According to the account of one Indian survivor of the battle: > We passed a black man in a soldier's uniform and we had him. He turned on > his horse and shot an Indian right through the heart. Ihen the Indians fired > at this one man and riddled his horse with bullets. His horse fell over on > his back and the black man could not get up. I saw him as I rode by.Connell, > 24-27 According to Connell 1985, white survivors tell a similar story. Dorman had been unhorsed but continued to fire at the Indians: > Pvt. Roman Rutten, unlike Vestal [Stanley Vestal; in reference to the story > mentioned below], did fight at the Little Big Horn and his report of > Isaiah's last stand rings through. Rutten was on a horse that hated the odor > of Indians so his immediate problem was how to stay in the saddle. During a > wild ride he passed Isiaih, whose horse had been shot. The black man was on > one knee, firing carefully with a non-regulation sporting rifle. He looked > up and shouted, \\"Goodbye, Rutten. Other eyewitness accounts from survivors indicate that Dorman was tortured by a group of women who pounded him with stone hammers, slashed him repeatedly with knives, and shot his legs full of buckshot. One odd detail reported is that his coffee pot and cup were filled with blood. A report that he had been 'sliced open' may be a translator's error; near his body was that of one of the Ree (Arikara) scouts, which had been slashed open and a willow branch stuck in the opening. To the Indians, mutilations were characteristic of different tribes and particular marks meant certain things. As for the torture, the Indians considered him a traitor who had fought with the bluecoats against them. Dorman and Sitting Bull Sioux medicine man Sitting Bull reportedly offered Dorman a last drink of water on the battlefield. Dorman's last stand at the Little Bighorn is documented in Stanley Vestal's Sitting Bull-Champion of the Sioux (Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston, 1932), \\"Isaiah Dorman and the Custer Expedition\\" by Ronald McConnell, Journal of Negro History, 33 (July 1948), and Troopers with Custer: Historic Incidents of the Battle of the Little Big Horn by E. A. Brininstool, 1925, 1989. Vestal relates that Dorman was shot and wounded by the Indians on the field of battle. The Sioux chief Sitting Bull recognized the black interpreter and stopped during the fighting to give him a last drink of water. According to Vestal: > The Negro asked for water and Sitting Bull took his cup of polished black > buffalo horn, got some water and gave him to drink.Sitting Bull-Champion of > the Sioux-a Biography, Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston, 1932; Connell 24-27 Connell holds that Dorman and Sitting Bull most likely knew each other, but doubts the veracity of the Sioux chief's drink offer, noting that similar stories of European style chivalry were common at the time.Connell, p. 24-27 Some writers on Sitting Bull repeat the account as credible however, suggesting that it had little to do with sentimental notions of grand chivalry, but rather a practical gesture by the Sioux leader towards a doomed man. The water given and the 'stop order' was therefore a temporary reprieve, one last acknowledgement of the interpreter the medicine man had once personally known. A 2008 biography of Sitting Bull by the prominent historian Robert Utley notes the incident in more detail. According to Utley, Dorman fell, badly wounded in the chest, and several warriors gathered around to finish the job. Dorman made a final plea in the Sioux language to \\"my friends\\", asking that they not count coup on him, since he was already dead. Sitting Bull rode up and said \\"Don't kill that man, he is a friend of mine.\\" The Sioux leader then dismounted, poured water into a buffalo-horn cup and gave it to the black man. His obligation thus discharged, Sitting Bull mounted up once more, and rode on.Sitting Bull The Life and Times of an American Patriot by Robert M. Utley, Macmillan 2008, p. 153 Eagle Robe, a Hunkpapa woman scouring the battlefield, dispatched Dorman with a rifle shot, and others following mutilated the body. This was done so that the enemy would not look good in the spirit world.Utley, p. 153 Whatever the exact details most writers agree that Dorman was friendly with the Indians, but this did not save him once the battle was joined. Aftermath Dorman's body was found just out of the timber, near Charley Reynolds's and he was buried on the Reno Battlefield. It was reinterred in 1877 at Custer National Cemetery. In Quartermaster Nowlan's official report on the 7th's 1876 Campaign, an item of $62.50 is listed as being owed to Dorman for services rendered in June 1876. A man named Isaac McNutt, who was a handyman at Ft Rice, attempted to claim the wages; but his claim was dismissed for lack of proof of connection. Dorman's Indian widow could not be found and the account may be still drawing interest somewhere in the Army bureaucracy. References Other sources * Dorman biography * Evan S.

It serves the town of Buckfastleigh. History The station was opened by the Buckfastleigh, Totnes and South Devon Railway on 1 May 1872. The railway was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway in 1897 and this in turn was nationalised into British Railways on 1 January 1948. A camping coach was positioned here by the Western Region from 1956 to 1961. The station closed to passengers in November 1958 although goods traffic on the line continued until 10 September 1962. It was re-opened as the Dart Valley Railway, a heritage railway, on 5 April 1969. The South Devon Railway Trust took over the running of the line on 1 January 1991. In 1971 Buckfastleigh became the terminus of the line when the route beyond the station was closed to allow improvements to the A38 road. Workshops have since been provided for restoring and repairing the locomotives and rolling stock used on the railway. The goods shed has been converted to a railway museum and this is the home of Tiny the last remaining broad gauge locomotive. Services The station is served by trains on all operating days of the South Devon Railway. Trains operate daily from late March to the end of October. On most days a single train set operates, providing four journeys a day in each direction. On busy days two train sets may operate, providing more journeys.

Founded in 1999, the aim of the organisation is to promote and facilitate dialogue among the leadership of the main belligerents. It also conducts research and analysis on mediation and peacemaking in support of its operational work to improve international efforts to secure and sustain peace. To do so, HD opens channels of communication and mediates between parties in conflict, as well as facilitates dialogue and provides support to the broader mediation and peacebuilding community. HD will facilitate dialogue in both confidential settings as well as public ones. It is headquartered in Geneva, which is also the location of its Middle East and North Africa programme. HD has regional offices in Africa and Asia. History The initial intention of HD was to explore new concepts of humanitarian innovation by serving as a venue for dialogue on humanitarian issues - where discreet discussions could take place among those who could have a practical impact on humanitarian policy and practice. The organisation evolved this approach to include negotiations in support of humanitarian objectives and aimed to create space for humanitarian activities in conflict environments. It quickly broadened, at the behest of conflicting parties in Aceh,The discreet charms of the international go-betweens to include the resolution of the conflict through mediation and conflict prevention. In July 2015, in recognition of its important role in the mediation of armed conflicts, HD was granted a special status by the Federal Council of Switzerland. Through this status, HD was awarded certain privileges and immunises intended to enable its peacemaking efforts worldwide. Leadership The Founding Executive Director of HD was Martin Griffiths. He led the organization for more than 10 years, from 1999 to July 2010, when he stepped down from his position. Griffiths was replaced for a brief period (July 2010 to March 2011) by Angelo Gnaedinger, former Director General of the ICRC and the then HD Regional Director for the Middle East. Following this transitional period, David Harland was appointed as HD's new Executive Director in April 2011. Activities HD aims to bring parties together through mediation and dialogue on issues of common concern in conflict zones.Annual Report 2011, p. 2. More specifically, this includes the following activities: * Open and maintain channels to or between parties to a conflict; * Help prepare environments for mediation and the resolution of armed conflict; * Facilitate dialogue in support of wider mediation and dialogue processes, and; * Provide support to other mediation initiatives through advice, people and operational assistance. Peacemaking projects HD has been involved in peacemaking activities in the Philippines, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, Kenya, Libya, the Central African Republic, Nigeria, Senegal, Liberia, Somalia, Mali, Indonesia (Aceh), Timor Leste, Burundi, Nepal, and Ukraine, as well as in a large number of confidential operational projects. In Tunisia, HD supported an informal dialogue process between the country’s main political parties which culminated in July 2014 with the signing of a Charter of Honour on the fair, transparent and democratic conduct of elections. In Libya, HD helped drafting the Humanitarian Appeal for Benghazi, a document signed by 76 \\"sons and daughters of Benghazi\\" including tribal leaders, parliamentarians, lawyers, judges and former military commanders who commit themselves and call upon others to improve the access for humanitarian workers, to respect international humanitarian law and establish a system of transitional justice for their hometown. In Syria, HD's Special Adviser Nir Rosen facilitated temporary ceasefires and negotiated surrenders to the Syrian government of rebel-held pockets, which saw the mass population transfers to rebel-held northern Syria of tens of thousands of rebels, activists and civilians refusing the live under the Bashar al-Assad government. In the Philippines, HD is a member of the International Contact Group which has been supporting the Government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in a peace process which aimed to end decades of conflict in the southern Philippines. This process culminated in signing of historic agreements, the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro in 2012 and the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro in 2014. In Kenya, HD supported a peace process between local communities in the Rift Valley of Kenya. This area had been the epicentre of post-election violence in 2007-2008. The process culminated in the signing of a peace agreement, the Nakuru County Peace Accord in August 2012. In northern Mali, HD facilitated and moderated the meeting which led to the signing of the Ouagadagou Declaration by the six political and military movements of Azawad on 28 August 2014. The purpose of the declaration was to put an end to hostilities in northern Mali and to establish a political and legal status for Azawad. In Nigeria, HD supported an inter-communal dialogue process with five local government areas (LGAs) from southern Kaduna State, which culminated in the Kafanchan Peace Declaration in March 2016. It is a commitment to non- violent conflict resolution by communities from five local government areas (LGAs) in southern Kaduna State. Support to the community of mediators HD seeks to improve the practice of mediation and strengthen capacity within the community of mediators. Support activities include: *Promoting the sharing of experiences in the mediation sector: HD collaborates with the United Nations, regional organisations such as ECOWAS, governments, and civil society. *Developing new ways to approach the many issues that surround the topic of mediation: HD has launched a series of publications including the Mediation Practice Series, which seeks to provide mediation practitioners with insight into how challenges have been addressed by others in order to help them prepare for the demands of mediation. The Oslo Forum Papers aim to advance thinking and debate on issues linked to armed conflict mediation and international peacemaking. Networking in the mediation community HD seeks to promote the sharing of experiences within the community of mediators and peacemakers at The Oslo Forum. Launched in 2003, the Oslo Forum is an initiative led by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and HD to improve practice in conflict mediation, and to enhance mediation as a profession. The Oslo Forum features an annual global event in Oslo, as well as regional forums in Africa and Asia. Values and principles HD vision The organisation was founded to pursue Henry Dunant’s vision of a world more humane. The aim, through mediation and dialogue, is to reduce the suffering caused by armed conflict in the world – where possible, to prevent such conflict; otherwise to help resolve it; or to mitigate its consequences.

Bien is one of two Danish language newspapers published in the United States. The other is a biweekly, Den Danske Pioneer, a unit of Bertelsen Publishing Co., based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. History Bien was founded and edited by the Norwegian Synod minister I.L.P Dietrickson, a pastor in San Francisco, on April 22, 1882. Initially, it had 16 pages, four to six of which were dedicated to pictures, features, and short stories, and about two pages of advertising. In 1890, the newspaper came under Danish management when Danish typographers Sophus Hartwick and Peter Freese became co-editors of the paper. In 1897, Sophus Hartwick assumed control of the paper and worked as the chief editor until 1930. During the last decades of the 19th century, the Danish immigrants in the United States had founded 34 Danish-language newspapers and aided in 24 other Danish-Norwegian newspapers. Of those, 15 remained in 1900, including papers such as Den Danske Pioneer, Bikuben, Danskeren, Dannevirke, Bien, Revyen and Nordlyset. After World War II, only Den Danske Pioneer and Bien remained. Den Danske Pioneer, edited and published by Sophus F. Neeble, was founded in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1872. Today, these two papers are the only remaining two Danish-language newspapers in the United States, although Bien has since ceased printing hard copies. Bien was considered the last newspaper in California to be printed using Linotype, according to the California Newspaper Publishers Association. When Andersen, who had been a Linotype operator at the Los Angeles Times, sold Bien in 2001, the newspaper switched from Linotype to computer typesetting. It is published in Burbank, California and has a circulation of approximately 3,000. Jytte Madsen currently serves as publisher and editor-in-chief of Bien. Purposes of Bien Newspaper According to the newspaper's website, Bien is published based on the four fundamental purposes: to provide news from Denmark to keep its readers up to date with people and relevant events there, to inform Danes in America about each other and be the Danish connection between them, to entertain and inform its readers of issues relevant to Danes living in America, and to include contributions from its readers about themselves and their lives and give the readers their own voice. Bien also served as an outlet for social clubs and local interest groups to gather and organize. Such organizations would notify readers of meetings in the “Foreninger i San Francisco” (Associations in San Francisco) section of Bien, where one could find the times and locations of local Scandinavian related organizations. Groups such as Danske Damers Hjælpeforeninger (the Danish Women's Relief Society), the Danish-American Women's Auxiliary of San Francisco Dannevirke Chapter, and the Danish-American Women's Club all made listings in Bien, noting the various locations at which one interested could become involved in the association. The Danish American Women's Club was started on March 5, 1935, when a group of Danish women from various Danish lodges around the Bay Area met at Hotel Whitcomb in San Francisco to form the Danish-America Women's Club. The objective of the club was to entertain visiting Danes as well as local ladies of Danish descent or with an interest in Danish affairs. In 2015, the Danish-American Women's Club celebrated its 80th year Christmas luncheon, which was noted by The Danish Pioneer newspaper. Today, the DAWC continues its traditions and meet several times throughout the year to celebrate their Danish heritage and interest in Denmark. Relocations of Bien Poul Andersen was a printer who served in the Danish resistance movement, which began after the German invasion of Denmark in 1940 during World War II,Jerry Voorhis, “Germany and Denmark: 1940-45,” Scandinavian Studies 44:2 (1972) p. 183. and later became the primary editor of Bien newspaper. Poul Andersen was born April 19, 1922, in Ringkøbing, Denmark. He left for America in 1949 to stay at his uncle's corn farm in Ohio, and settled in Los Angeles, California soon after. Andersen became the editor of Bien newspaper in 1975 and continued to run the paper for 26 years. When Andersen bought Bien in 1975, he was working as a printer for the Los Angeles Times. Andersen relocated Bien to Burbank, California, so he could edit the newspaper after completing his shift at the Times. He continued to publish Bien even after his retirement from the Los Angeles Times, where he worked full-time until his retirement in 1987. At that time, Bien was the only weekly Danish-language newspaper and was then converted from a 16 into a 12-page weekly paper. Andersen published the newspaper with the aid of his wife, Judy Andersen, from 1975 to 2001. Bien was sold to another publisher, Bent Christensen & Albert Jakobsen in 2001 when Andersen's illness worsened. Danish Recognition When Bien celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1982, Poul Andersen was knighted into the Order of the Dannebrog by Denmark's Queen Margrethe II for his work to unite the Danish American community. Bien Today The last printed issue of Bien was released on May 24, 2018. Beginning July 1, 2018, Bien can only be found at their website and on Facebook.

History Cardiff Corporation had bought out the Cardiff Waterworks Company in 1879, and in March 1881 asked their Borough Engineer, John Avery Brandon Williams, to produce a report on all possible sources of water for Cardiff, so that they could plan for the future. Williams presented his reports in May and August 1881, suggesting that the best scheme was to impound the waters of the upper Taff Fawr. The Corporation were a little hesitant, but consulted the water engineer John Frederick Bateman, who also recommended the Taff Fawr scheme in June 1882 as the one most likely to meet the needs for water at the lowest cost. They presented a bill to Parliament in November 1883, which was considered by a House of Commons Committee between 1 May and 20 May 1884. There were 16 petitions against it and serious opposition from riparian landowners, but several influential civil engineers was called to give evidence, notably Bateman, Thomas Hawksley James Mansergh, and George H. Hill. J A B Williams, their own Engineer, and the meteorologist George James Symonds also gave evidence, and although it cost the Corporation £3,652 to fight the case, Royal Assent was obtained for the Cardiff Corporation Act 1884 on 7 August. The catchment of the upper Taff Fawr was but it was split into an upper area of and a lower one of . Any works had to provide compensation water to maintain the flow in the Taff Fawr, and working on the upper area first meant that they only had to supply per day of compensation flow until work started on the lower area. Cantref Reservoir, at the time known as Cantreff, was the first to be built, together with a pipeline to Lisvane Reservoir and Llanishen Reservoir and intermediate balancing reservoirs at Blackbrook, Cefn, and Rhubina. Work on the pipeline was completed in September 1888, and on the balancing reservoirs in November 1888. Construction or the reservoir was not so straight forward. Initially the contract for construction of the earth dam, which was about long with a puddle clay core, was awarded to William Jones of Neath. To provide access to the site, a standard gauge railway, some long, was built from Cefn Coed to the reservoir sites, and by the time the first sod was cut for the reservoir by the Mayor on 4 May 1886, around of the railway had already been completed. Jones succeeded in cutting the embankment trench and filling the bottom with a concrete key, but he lacked funds, and did not have enough pumping plant to keep the workings dry. Many of his labourers left the job, and progress became very slow. The Town Clerk took possession of the works on 29 October 1888, which included Jones' plant, tools and implements. Jones then took out a writ against the Corporation, and an agreement was not reached until June 1889, with the Corporation paying £10,000 to the court in July. Meanwhile, a new contract was awarded in March 1889 to John Mackay of Newport, who had previously completed work on Llanishen Reservoir and the balancing reservoirs at Blackbrook, Cefn and Rhubina for the Corporation. The contract was for £89,619, and he had two years to complete the work, but again progress was slow, with the extremely wet weather of 1890 being a significant factor. He struggled to retain his workforce, and wrote to J A B Williams explaining the difficulties. By February 1891 he had completed about half of the job, and on 18 March 1891 the Water Committee relieved him of his contract, paid for the work that had been done, and took possession of his plant, railways, a quarry and a clay field from which the puddle clay was extracted. Mackay's involvement with the project ceased on 13 June 1891. Completion of the reservoir was achieved by using direct labour. J T Jones was the first site manager, but became ill, and this role was taken over by F Orton in November 1881. The reservoir was formally opened on 14 September 1892 by Alderman David Jones, who was chairman of the Waterworks Committee, and impounding of water began on the same day. A plaque to commemorate the event named the Waterworks Engineer, J A B Williams, but failed to mention either of the contractors. The weir and the steps of the overflow channel on the western side of the dam were faced in granite obtained from Cornwall, but the rest of the stone was obtained from a quarry near Cefn Coed, served by sidings on the railway, at which extraction began while Jones was fulfilling his contract. As built, the crest of the dam was above the foundations, and above the level of the river. At its maximum, the water is deep, and the dam created a reservoir which is long, holding . It covers an area of Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1904 and its surface level is Above Ordnance Datum. Unlike the other two reservoirs in the chain, the size as built was that specified by the original Act of 1884, whereas the capacity of Beacons and Llwyn-on was doubled when construction began. Railways The remote location of Cantref Reservoir and the huge amount of material needed to construct the dam resulted in plans for a standard gauge railway to be built. This left the London and North Western Railway/Brecon and Merthyr Tydfil Junction Railway joint line near Cefn-coed-y-cymmer station, and passed through a rocky gorge, where a trestle bridge was built to carry it over the Taff Fawr. The bridge was long, and some above the river. After that, it ran on a ledge to the west of the river, and by the time it reached the site of Llwyn-on Reservoir, on which work did not start until 1911, it ran along the valley floor. At first, it may have crossed over the river near Nant-Ddu lodge, and run along its eastern bank to the foot of the dam, but it later stayed on the western bank to reach the top of the dam. The track was built by William Jones, the first contractor for the reservoir, on the basis that it would be taken over by the Corporation. Work began on it around April 1886, and it was largely finished by October, although storm damage meant that some of the ballasting was delayed. After Jones' reservoir contract had been revoked, the railway was valued at £3,395 in December 1888 as part of the settlement litigation. A temporary incline was contructed in June 1889 to the north of the dam, but it is not clear whether this began at the lower level and was used to raise materials, or began at the higher level and was used to lower them to the worksite. The railway was built on land owned by Sir William Lewis to the south of Cantref, and was later extended northwards over land belonging to Lord Tredegar to enable the reservoir at Beacons to be built. In 1891 the Corporation negotiated with Lewis to allow the railway to remain in place for another six years, and it was agreed, providing that the route was properly fenced, gates were provided at level crossings where necessary, and goods for local farms could be transported from Cefn for free. When the railway was no longer needed, the land would be reinstated, or the landowner could buy it. However, around of track were lifted in March 1892, after a disagreement developed. This was probably a new section which was part of the northern extension, but the difficulties were eventually resolved, and the track was reinstated in April 1893. The Board of Trade approved the plans for the extension on 27 April 1893 and by June, two timber viaducts had been built, to carry the railway over ravines on the west bank of the reservoir, and the Beacons site was reached, creating a railway that was in length. Puddle clay for the construction of the core of the dam was obtained from land owned by the Crawshay Brothers, part of their ironworks near Merthyr Tydfil. It was located near the Six Bells public house at Pen-yr-Heolgerrig, and a -gauge railway was used to transfer the clay from the field to the main line railway. It was then moved to the Corporation sidings at Cefn Coed, from where the private locomotives hauled it up the valley to Cantref. One narrow gauge locomotive is known to have worked at the clay pit, an 0-4-0 saddle tank named Darrell, which was obtained second-hand from the Bargoed Coal Company of Fochriw around 1885. It was probably obtained by Mackay, but passed into Corporation ownership when his contract was terminated, and was sold to the Crawshay Brothers in early 1897 for £150, becoming their Cyfarthfa 14. Tracing the history of the standard gauge locomotives used on the construction project is a little more difficult. Jones, the first contractor, is known to have had one locomotive, and possibly a second. When Mackay took over the contract, he bought four more with him, and so there were five or six operating during this period. The Corporation bought a second-hand locomotive in 1891, and two new ones in 1891 and 1894. Four 0-6-0 and two 0-4-0 saddle tanks have been positively identified, and there was a locomotive named Swansea, the identity of which is less certain. There were three sales of plant and equipment in 1897 and 1898, at which eight locomotives were listed, so it is possible that some were offered for sale more than once. One locomotive, named Cantreff was definitely auctioned at the final sale on 2 September 1898 and subsequently worked in the Northamptonshire ironstone industry until 1962.

The Blue Guitars album, packaged in the style of an earbook, consists of eleven CDs, one DVD and a full colour book, including paintings by the artist, liner notes and song lyrics. It is an ambitious project about blues music with the 137 songs recorded over the course of 18 months with a work schedule - according to Chris Rea himself - of twelve hours a day, seven days a week. 2007 saw the release of a 2 CD \\"best of\\" compilation Blue Guitars: A Collection Of Songs. Initially the project was inspired by Bill Wyman's Blues Odyssey and can be called an \\"odyssey\\" in its own right, for depicting a journey through the various epochs of Blues music, starting at its African origins and finishing with modern-time Blues from the 1960s and 1970s. There were held several live exhibitions of the album's artwork paintings, like in October 2005 at The Cork Street Gallery, Central London, England, and Spazio Oikos, Milan, Italy. The earbook album sold over 150,000 copies in Europe, and 170,000 until 2017.  Summary  The eleven separate records which comprise \\"Blue Guitars\\" could as well stand on their own; in combination, however, they provide a journey through the different epochs of the Blues, showing the various components that have been added to the original African Blues over time, the changes in instrumentation, style, lyrical expression and thematic implications. Thereby Chris Rea and his band imitate the various styles and lyrical topics, creating an instantly recognisable atmosphere on each record, with the first few songs usually setting up the direction in which the record is going and then developing to various styles within the field of each record. Initially 16 CDs were planned, but Rea noted his initial idea was too intellectual and did not intend for the work to be seen as an academic work, yet as a story. He noted that it's not meant to be played in one day, neither songs separately, as far the thread can be followed, but nevertheless it should be enjoyed in the prolonged period of time. He also expressed concern about the digitalization of modern generations whose musical perception lacks the attitude for making the record listening a specific enjoyable experience. For each of the albums were studied their history and characteristics, and for the recording process and sessions in the studio were procured and used equipments which was used at the specific time, and the studio itself was set up in the way to best-possibly convey the sound of rooms of the previous times.  Album number one – Beginnings  The first album of this set deals with the very beginnings of the Blues, tracing its ways back to its African roots. Living conditions were hard, many African natives were taken captives and transported across the ocean to be sold as slaves, sometimes even betrayed by their own people, which is vividly depicted in the song \\"The King Who Sold His Own\\". All in all it was an environment, where it was only natural for the Blues to develop, and even though the instrumentation and the construction of the songs was still very different from what we now know as Blues, the basics were already there: the sadness, the strain, the burdens, the depression, the feeling of \\"blue\\" and – of course – the underlying musical structure. Track list: #West Africa – 4.14 #Cry for Home – 4.58 #The King Who Sold his Own – 5.18 #White Man Coming – 4.01 #Where The Blues Come From – 6.18 #Lord Tell Me It Won't Be Long – 4.58 #Work Gang – 4.32 #Praise The Lord – 4.41 #Sweet Sunday – 5.38 #Sing Out The Devil – 6.08 #Boss Man Cut My Chains – 3.21  Album number two – Country Blues  Country Blues was the natural development, the original Blues would go, once it had arrived in the American South: it was a dark time, a time of fear, people had to work hard during slavery, even harder after they had been released, wandering around unemployed, aimlessly. Racism and KKK made the situation even worse, which reflected in the music, instrumentation gradually changed and the lyrics told stories of fear (KKK Blues), aimless wandering (Walkin' Country Blues), alcoholism (Too Much Drinkin'), but also the flight from prevailing conditions, maybe with another perspective for life and the future in the big cities (Ticket for Chicago). But also themes of movement (Steam Train Blues) and the faith in God and Religion (If You've Got A Friend In Jesus) were made topics in the songs, as well as the occasional search for some recreation and a good time (Dance All Night Long). The social and personal problems found their way into the music and started to change the Blues on a profound level. Track list: #\\" Walkin' Country Blues – 3.40 #\\" Man Gone Missing – 4.40 #\\" Can't Stay Blues – 4.58 #\\" KKK Blues – 4.56 #\\" Too Much Drinkin' – 4.52 #\\" Catwalk Woman – 4.32 #\\" If You've Got A Friend in Jesus – 4.24 #\\" Head Out On The Highway – 4.32 #\\" Wild Pony – 4.10 #\\" Steam Train Blues – 3.50 #\\" Going Up To Memphis – 4.20 #\\" Somewhere Between Highway 61 & 49 – 6.06 #\\" Ticket For Chicago – 5.16 #\\" Dance All Night Long – 4.31  Album number three – Louisiana & New Orleans  When the originally African and South-influenced Blues were brought to Louisiana, New Orleans, the Mississippi Delta, new instruments were added clarinet, brass, piano, mandolins, accordions – and along with the banjo mingled into an interesting mix, which would be known as New Orleans, Swamp, Cajun or Riverboat Blues. The basics for directions like Jazz, Swing and even Rock & Roll were laid during this time and a distinctive, instantly recognizable sound was created, which would imminently be associated with the Blues. Track list: #\\" Two Days Missing Down The Viper Room – 2.56 #\\" Who Cares If I Do – 4.23 #\\" What Made Me Love You – 3.16 #\\" You Got Dixie – 4.41 #\\" One Night With You – 5.29 #\\" Talking 'bout New Orleans – 5.27 #\\" Le Fleur De La Vie – 3.13 #\\" Catfish Girl – 3.50 #\\" Only A Fool Plays By The Rules – 4.00 #\\" Baby Come Home – 3.30 #\\" Dance Avec Moi – 3.15 #\\" L'ete Eternal – 3.31  Album number four – Electric Memphis Blues  The Blues and Blues Musicians finally could make themselves heard among the loud crowds and stuffed places, they usually used to play. It was a tremendous change in the way, the Blues could be approached, fine and subtle figures and fine chord structures could suddenly be played, the Blues was rising to previously unbeknown heights: \\"Now I can play above the bar noise, Man I'm bigger than a crowd\\" as Rea states in the opener \\"Electric Guitar\\", which paraphrases what musicians must have felt after this milestone revolution. Nor did \\"electric\\" stop at the guitars – organs, pianos, keyboards, all was going electric, studios started to play around with the new electric sound, the possibilities seemed endless. Track list: #\\" Electric Guitar – 4.42 #\\" Electric Memphis Blues – 4.15 #\\" All Night Long – 4.11 #\\" Born Bad – 3.46 #\\" Let's Start Again – 3.52 #\\" What I'm Looking For – 4.26 #\\" Rules Of Love – 3.12 #\\" What You Done To Me – 3.28 #\\" Hobo Love Blues – 3.38 #\\" Pass Me By – 3.06 #\\" The Soul Of My Father's Shadow – 3.52 #\\" My Blue World Says Hello – 4.06  Album number five – Texas Blues  And yet another direction, the Blues was morphing into. Take the basic concept, move it into the \\"modern wild west\\" and what you get out of it is straightforward Texas Blues. It's all in there, endless highways, run-down trucker bars, oil, dirt, cowboy boots, stories about life on the move, all down in Texas, all just as sad as the original Blues (Lone Star Boogie, No Wheels Blues). The mixture of the basic Blues concept with more country and western styled instruments (slide guitars, harmonica) gave the Blues a rawer, yet again still instantly recognizable sound, which has played a major role in music ever since (up to Stevie Vaughan and ZZ Top). \\"I still remember, the place we used to go, dreaming dreams of Texas, as we pushed hard through the snow\\" – Chris Rea Track list: #\\" Lone Rider (Texas Blues) – 4.44 #\\" Texas Blue – 5.10 #\\" No Wheels Blues – 5.02 #\\" Lone Star Boogie – 5.16 #\\" Blind Willie – 6.48 #\\" The American Way – 4.07 #\\" Angellina – 4.47 #\\" Truck Stop – 4.49 #\\" Weekend Down Mexico – 4.20 #\\" Texas Line Boogie – 4.41 #\\" Too Big City – 5.02 #\\" Houston Angel – 3.59  Album number six – Chicago Blues  Again it was movement that was pushing the Blues into a new direction, movement upwards North to Chicago in the pursuit of jobs and a new life. People suddenly found themselves in a completely different situation and this instantly influenced the Blues, the electric style, developed earlier on in Electric Memphis and Texas Blues, remained, however became harder and edgier, instruments like the saxophone were incorporated into the music and gave this new hybrid a sometimes jazzy feel. Once again, the lyric themes shifted away from known territory and began to reflect the changed situation, drugs, alcohol, sex, women, money gained major importance, life in wintry ghettos and anonymous housing schemes contributed its share. Track list: #\\" I'm Moving Up (Chicago Blues) – 4.30 #\\" Maxwell Street – 4.39 #\\" Bob Taylor – 5.15 #\\" She's A Whole Heap Of Trouble – 2.30 #\\" Jazzy Blue – 3.24 #\\" Hip-Sway – 3.39 #\\" That's The Way It Goes – 3.32 #\\" To Get Your Love – 5.07 #\\" Chicago Morning – 4.56 #\\" Catwalk Woman – 3.35 #\\" Since You've Been Gone – 4.09 #\\" All Night Long – 5.27 #\\" Here She Come Now – 4.14  Album number seven – Blues Ballads  With the incorporation of the piano and other new elements, such as swing and jazz, according to Chris Rea a somehow \\"sleepy morphine-induced style\\" came to be Blues Ballads. The original, primitive influences are no longer recognizable, replaced by a calmer, smoother, more polished, yet nonetheless still recognizable, style of Blues. All that constituted the Blues in the past is still there. Track list: #\\" Last Call (Blues Ballads) – 3.41 #\\" Maybe That's All I Need To Know – 4.28 #\\" Deep Winter Blues – 5.09 #\\" If I Ever Get Over You – 5.08 #\\" I Love The Rain – 4.35 #\\" My Soul Crying Out For You – 3.38 #\\" If That's What You Want – 4.18 #\\" There's No One Looking – 5.34 #\\" What Became Of You – 4.54 #\\" My Deep Blue Ways – 4.25  Album number eight – Gospel Soul Blues & Motown  While the basic structures and rhythms of the Blues remained true to the original, still a new generation moved the Blues onwards, banjo style played on electric guitar became the electric \\"sitar\\", the sound hit the nerve of the Indy/Hippie generation, instantly recognizable - Tamla Motown. Softer and easier accessible than previous hybrids of the Blues. Track list: #\\" Sweet Love – 4.25 #\\" Break Another Piece Of My Heart – 4.39 #\\" Ball & Chain – 5.08 #\\" Gospel Trail – 5.05 #\\" Shy Boy – 3.52 #\\" Come Change My World – 4.15 #\\" Call On Me – 4.10 #\\" Just In Case You Never Knew – 4.29 #\\" Let Me In – 5.52 #\\" I’ll Be There For You – 4.18 #\\" The Pain Of Loving You – 3.57 #\\" Are You Ready – 6.08  Album number nine – Celtic & Irish Blues  The Blues went in yet another direction, when it started to mingle with Celtic and Scottish/Irish influences, forming still another hybrid. The general feeling of sadness, loss and blues, which is inherent in the Scottish, Irish and Celtic roots anyway, together with an all new instrumentation could lay the basis for a different kind of approach, giving the Blues the typical Celtic feel. Track list: #\\" Celtic Blue (Celtic And Irish Blues) – 8.11 #\\" Too Far From Home – 7.28 #\\" 'Til The Morning Sun Shines On My Love And Me – 5.39 #\\" Lucky Day – 5.16 #\\" What She Really Is – 5.03 #\\" Wishing Well – 4.11 #\\" Irish Blues – 4.14 #\\" No More Sorrow – 6.05 #\\" While I Remain – 5.30 #\\" Last Drink – 5.17 #\\" 'Til I Find My True Love's Name – 3.42 #\\" Big White Door – 5.36  Album number ten – Latin Blues  Latin Music may not be the most obvious direction to look for the Blues, still there were great influences from the African culture with slaves landing in Brazil, who influenced the Caribbeans from their own direction, Cuban guitar and some kind of trademark piano were added, creating a mix so different from Mississippi Blues, and yet, Bossa Nova Blues was a direction in its own right. The Blues was even swapping over into Reggae, but in spite of its \\"sunshine feeling\\" the themes and topics were just as sad. Track list: #\\" Hey Gringo (Latin Blues) – 6.04 #\\" Immigration Blues – 5.19 #\\" Still Trying To Clear My Name – 4.26 #\\" Sun Is Hot – 4.28 #\\" Screw You And Your Deep Blue Sea – 4.43 #\\" Nothing Seems To Matter No More – 3.55 #\\" Sometimes – 5.00 #\\" Lampiou – 5.46 #\\" Keep On Dancing – 3.56 #\\" Lucifer's Angel – 5.08 #\\" How I Know It's You – 4.17 #\\" Forever – 5.03 #\\" You Got Soul – 5.27 #\\" Bajan Blue – 4.57  Album number eleven – '60s and '70s  A new time, a new generation, a new variation of the Blues. Things had started changing once again and once again, the whole 200-year-history of the Blues was thrown over in the split of a second, when Blues suddenly started to sound old again, respect was paid to the ancestors of modern Blues music, but there was also Woodstock, the Flower Power Movement, all those kinds of currencies that were interpreting the Blues in their own way and gave it a new face. Track list: #\\" My Baby Told Me (Blues)(60s/70s) – 2.55 #\\" Got To Be Moving – 4.03 #\\" My Baby Told Me (Gospel) – 3.19 #\\" Heartbreaker – 2.58 #\\" Yes I Do (Instrumental) – 3.28 #\\" Wasted Love – 4.44 #\\" Cool Cool Blue – 4.15 #\\" Clarkson Blues – 5.09 #\\" Who Killed Love – 4.27 #\\" Never Tie Me Down – 4.13 #\\" Mindless – 3.55 #\\" Ain't That Just The Prettiest Thing – 5.20 #\\" Nobody But You – 3.55 #\\" Waiting For Love – 4.57 #\\" Blue Morning In The Rain – 4.50  Dancing Down The Stony Road DVD  This is a little add-on to the overall collection of music, some kind of making-of the Dancing Down the Stony Road album that Rea released in 2002, following the wake of his disease, his split with the record company and the process of coming to terms with his new style of music. The DVD might be especially interesting to those who own the album; there are many interviews with Rea and the Band, a lot of footage from the writing and the recording sessions and a thorough depiction of the process of making an idea become reality.

The site represents the semi- natural calcareous grasslands supporting particular flora and fauna, and particularly a number of rare and uncommon species. The Hill has a large golf course on the top, and has a public right of way round its edge which is part of the Cotswold Way. (The exact line of the right of way and its interaction with the golf greens has been the subject of some controversy over the years.) The rights of way were redefined by a public enquiry in 2012 and are signposted. Views The view from Drakestone Point ( at ) over the Vale to the River Severn and Forest of Dean beyond, is particularly fine, but the tranquility is injured by the proximity of the M5 Motorway. Since 1992 volunteers have done a great deal of work on the Hill, attempting to restore the open views over the Severn Vale. The cleared areas can be seen from the M5, and the Cotswold Way has now been re-routed around the Hill to take advantage of this work.

As an art director, he won the Oscar for Best Art Direction in 1942 for How Green Was My Valley, along with Richard Day and Thomas Little. His work on The Razor's Edge in 1946 also received an Academy nomination. In the 1950s, he began to direct, and was known for science fiction and fantasy films such as Attack of the 50 Foot Woman. He was also the brother of quality guru Joseph M. Juran.  Life and career  Early life Juran was born to a Jewish family in Gura Humorului, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Romania). In 1912, he emigrated to America with his family, settling in Minneapolis. He earned a bachelor's degree in Architecture from the University of Minnesota. He also spent a summer studying at the École des Beaux-Arts before earning a master's degree in Architecture from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He passed the architect's exam and set up his own office as an architect.Swires, April 1989 p 58 Art department With the construction industry at a standstill due to the Great Depression, Juran moved to Los Angeles. He sought architecture work at the studios and got a job doing a drawing of the Brooklyn Bridge for RKO Radio Pictures. He managed to get a permanent job a draftsman in the art department. He was an assistant art director on Quality Street (1937). Juaran later moved to MGM, where he assisted in designing Juliet's bedroom in Romeo and Juliet (1936). He then joined 20th Century Fox, assisting art department head Richard Day on How Green Was My Valley (1941). Fox liked his work and put Juran under contract. His early credits as art director included Charley's American Aunt (1941), and Belle Starr (1941), and he and Day won an Oscar for their work on Valley. Juran also worked on I Wake Up Screaming (1941), A Gentleman at Heart (1942), Ten Gentlemen from West Point (1942), The Loves of Edgar Allan Poe (1942), Dr. Renault's Secret (1942), It's Everybody's War (1942, a short), and That Other Woman (1942). Juran enlisted in the Navy during the Second World War in July 1942 and was assigned to first the Office of Strategic Services and then to the Royal Air Force Intelligence Center. After the war, Juran returned to Fox, winning an Oscar nomination for his work on The Razor's Edge (1946). Juran accepted a seven-year contract to be head of the art department for Enterprise Productions. While there he was credited on The Other Love (1947) and Body and Soul (1947).Swires, April 1989 p 59 When Enterprise collapsed, Juran did Kiss the Blood Off My Hands (1948) for Harold Hecht and Tulsa (1948) for Walter Wanger. Universal Juran then signed a long-term contract with Universal, where he was the art director on Free for All (1949), Undertow (1949), Winchester '73 (1950), Deported (1950), Harvey (1950), Bright Victory (1951), Thunder on the Hill (1951), Reunion in Reno (1951), Cave of Outlaws (1951), The Strange Door (1951), Meet Danny Wilson (1951), Bend of the River (1952) and Untamed Frontier (1952). Director Juran was assigned as art department head for The Black Castle (1952), when director Joseph Pevney dropped out shortly before filming. Juran was asked to take over as director two weeks prior to filming. Universal were happy with Juran's work and signed him to a one-year directing contract. He made an Audie Murphy Western Gunsmoke (1952), and a Ronald Reagan Western Law and Order (1953), then did The Golden Blade (1953), an \\"Eastern\\" with Rock Hudson and Tumbleweed (1953) with Murphy. Juran went to Italy in 1954 to direct a swashbuckler, Knights of the Queen (1954), based on The Three Musketeers. He then directed some episodes of a TV series based on the movie. Juran returned to Hollywood to direct an independent film, Highway Dragnet (1954) based on a story by Roger Corman. After The Big Moment (1954) at Paramount he went back to Universal to do Drums Across the River (1954) with Murphy. Juran directed episodes of Fury (1954), Crossroads and My Friend Flicka on TV, and The Crooked Web (1955) for Sam Katzman at Columbia. Science fiction and fantasy Juran's first science fiction film was The Deadly Mantis (1957) at Universal. He followed this with Hellcats of the Navy (1957) starring Ronald Reagan and his wife (who was billed as Nancy Davis). It was his first film for producer Charles H. Schneer. Schneer hired Juran for 20 Million Miles to Earth (1957) with special effects by Ray Harryhausen. This film established Juran in the science fiction and fantasy genres. Schneer hired him to do another movie with Harryhausen, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1957). It was a commercial and critically success. Instead of continuing with A features, he accepted two jobs \\"for the money\\", in his own words: The Brain from Planet Arous (1957) then Attack of the 50 Foot Woman (1957). Both became cult classics. He was unhappy with how Arous turned out and arranged for his billing to be \\"Nathan Hertz\\". Juran did a Western for Schneer, Good Day for a Hanging (1958) and, for TV, episodes of Frances Langford Presents, World of Giants, and Men Into Space (1960). Juran got back into features with a motion picture he wrote himself, Jack the Giant Killer (1962) for producer Edward Small. He then did Flight of the Lost Balloon (1961), which was released first, an adventure heavily influenced by Jules Verne, which he co-wrote and directed. Around this time he provided the stories for, but did not direct, Doctor Blood's Coffin (1961) and Boy Who Caught a Crook (1961) and wrote a draft of Son of Captain Blood. Jurana did some second unit directing on MGM's Mutiny on the Bounty (1962). Schneer hired Juran to direct Siege of the Saxons (1963) and First Men in the Moon (1964) (based on the novel by H. G. Wells with effects by Harryhausen). He did an imperial adventure for Schneer, East of Sudan (1964) and directed second unit on Cyrano et d'Artagnan (1964). Television Juran turned to television in 1959. He directed episodes of A Man Called Shenandoah and Daniel Boone, and episodes of all four of Irwin Allen's 1960s science fiction series Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Lost in Space, The Time Tunnel and Land of the Giants. Last films He did a feature for Schneer, Land Raiders (1970), a Western, before an operation for cancer prompted him to retire in 1970. Juran returned from retirement to direct The Boy Who Cried Werewolf (1973) with his old Sinbad star, Kerwin Mathews. He then returned to his first career, architecture.Swires, May 1989 p 62 In 1999, he was honored with the Lifetime Career Award by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films, USA. He died at the age of 95 in Palos Verdes, California.

The Austin Twelve is a motor car introduced by Austin in 1921. It was the second of Herbert Austin's post World War I models and was in many ways a scaled-down version of his Austin Twenty, introduced in 1919. The slower than expected sales of the Twenty brought about this divergence from his intended one-model policy. The Twelve was announced at the beginning of November 1921 after Austin's company had been in receivership for six months.Austin. The Times, Friday, 4 November 1921; pg. 17; Issue 42869 The number twelve refers to its fiscal horse power (12.8) rather than its bhp which was 20 and later 27. The long-stroke engines encouraged by the tax regime, 72 x 102 later 72 x 114.5, had much greater low- speed torque than the bhp rating suggests. Overview Initially available as a tourer, by 1922 three body styles were offered: the four-seat tourer, the two/four-seater (both at 550 GBP) and the coupé at 675 GBP. The car enjoyed success throughout the vintage era with annual sales peaking at 14,000 in 1927. While the mechanical specification changed little (the engine increased from 1661 cc to 1861 cc in 1926), many body styles were offered with saloons becoming more popular as the twenties drew to a close. The car continued in the Austin catalogue and as a taxi option until 1939. The last cars were produced for the War Department in 1940. After the early thirties the car was referred to by the public as the Heavy Twelve to distinguish it from the other, newer, 12HP cars in the Austin catalogue Light Twelve-Four, Light Twelve-Six etc. and received some updating. The artillery style wheels were replaced by wire wheels in 1933 and coil ignition replaced the magneto in 1935. The gearbox was provided with synchromesh between its top two ratios in 1934. The factory catalogued body range was steadily updated with the last of the no longer fashionable Weymann style fabric-covered cars in 1931 and no open tourers after 1934. After the war the Austin Twelve name resumed in the Austin catalogue for a couple of years until the arrival in 1947 of the Austin A40 Dorset and Devon saloons. Today, the Austin Twelve is remembered as being virtually unburstable and is well catered for by the Vintage Austin Register in the UK and various other clubs in other parts of the world. Chassis \\"The gears were easily changed, the brakes worked well, yet were smooth in application, and the steering is steady and light. Ample lock enables the car to turn in a small space. Of the springing I have no complaint; much of its efficiency is probably due to proper lubrication of the leaves. The various controls are to hand, and in addition to a horn button on the instrument board there is a large circular switch on the steering wheel so that warning can be given without having to take off a hand.\\" from the report on the Austin Twelve Harley all-weather tourer published February 1924. Brakes A pedal operates shoes in enclosed drums at the rear and a centrally set hand lever applies a locomotive type of transmission brake which is anchored to the gear box. Hand adjusters are provided. Compensation is given by rubber washers. The rear-wheel brakes can also be taken up by hand on the primary rod. Four- wheel brakes This \\"very marked improvement\\" was announced for the Motor Show October 1924. The pedal now applied all four brakes on the wheels. Application was by cable, the sets were compensated and wear could be taken up individually. The carburettor was now given a strangler. The handbrake worked on the transmission for parking. Steering Steering gear is by worm and worm wheel. Suspension Suspension is by half-elliptical springs, those at the rear are underslung. Gaiters allowing leaf lubrication by oil are fitted, and such parts as shackle pins are greased by gun.

Gumdrop is an Austin Clifton Heavy Twelve-Four of 1926. The stories revolve around the car and his owner, initially the younger Bill McArran, but for most of the series, the more senior Mr Oldcastle (later joined by a dog, Horace). The plots often involve the search for replacement parts for Gumdrop. Biro wrote the stories from the late 1960s to the 1980s.

She is a companion of the Tenth Doctor in Doctor Who, after Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and before Donna Noble (Catherine Tate). According to the character's creator and executive producer Russell T Davies in his non- fiction book Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale, the character was developed from the beginning with the intention of appearing for a whole of the 2007 series, and to later make guest appearances in subsequent series and crossover appearances in the show's two spin-offs; Martha subsequently made guest appearances in Torchwood series two and in Doctor Who series four in 2008 and special episode \\"The End of Time\\" in 2010. Martha was also intended to make guest appearances in the 2009 series of Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures, but could not due to the actress's other work commitments. Within the series' narrative, Martha begins as a medical student who becomes The Doctor's time travelling companion after an incident at the hospital where she works. After well over a year (from the perspective of The Doctor and herself) travelling with The Doctor, Martha parts from The Doctor's company as she recognises how unhealthy their relationship has become. After returning to life on Earth, becoming engaged and finishing her medical degree, Martha finds a newfound level of independence when she is recruited into the paranormal military organisations UNIT, and briefly Torchwood. Having faced the end of the world single-handedly during her time with The Doctor, Martha is recognised for her skills both in the field and in medicine. Appearances Television Freema Agyeman's first appearance in Doctor Who was in the second series (2006) episode, \\"Army of Ghosts\\", where she played Adeola Oshodi, Martha's cousin. Martha Jones is introduced in the third series (2007) of Doctor Who, first appearing in the episode \\"Smith and Jones\\". When the hospital she works at is teleported to the Moon, medical student Martha helps save the day alongside an alien time traveller known only as The Doctor (David Tennant). To thank her for her help, The Doctor invites her to join him for a supposed single trip in his time machine the TARDIS, but later accepts her as his full-time \\"companion\\", admitting that she was \\"never just a passenger\\", and he even gives her the key to the TARDIS in the episode, \\"42\\". Martha becomes frustrated because The Doctor is oblivious to her feelings for him, and she expresses concern that she is simply a rebound after The Doctor's painful loss of his previous companion, Rose Tyler (Billie Piper). When the amnesiac Doctor falls in love in the two-part story \\"Human Nature\\" and \\"The Family of Blood\\", a pained Martha claims \\"You had to go and fall in love with a human... and it wasn't me\\". In the series finale, \\"The Sound of Drums\\" and \\"Last of the Time Lords\\", in which The Doctor's nemesis The Master (John Simm) takes over planet Earth, capturing both The Doctor and fellow companion Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), Martha manages to escape by teleporting away but is left alone to save the world. On the run from The Master, she spends a year travelling the world in a plan which restores the incapacitated Doctor and reverses time, undoing The Master's actions. Able to remember the events during The Master's reign, Martha then leaves the TARDIS of her own accord, telling The Doctor that she cannot waste her life pining for someone when the relationship cannot happen, but promises that she will see him again. Martha, as voiced by Freema Agyeman, also appears in the 2007 animated serial The Infinite Quest, which aired in twelve weekly segments during the run of the 2007 series. Martha reappears in the second series (2008) of the Doctor Who spin-off, Torchwood, which focuses on Captain Jack Harkness. First appearing in the episode \\"Reset\\" as part of a three-episode story arc, Martha has been temporarily drafted to the Torchwood organisation of alien-hunters by Jack, requiring a medical expert on alien life. Through exposition, it is revealed that Martha has become a \\"medical officer\\" for international paranormal investigations agency UNIT since qualifying as a Doctor of Medicine. Martha briefly joins the Cardiff-based Torchwood Three as its medical officer following the death of Owen Harper (Burn Gorman), but later leaves the organisation in the episode \\"A Day in the Death\\" once she is satisfied that Owen is fit to return to duty following his resurrection. Later in the fourth series of Doctor Who (2008), Martha returns for a three-episode arc beginning with the two-part story, \\"The Sontaran Stratagem\\" and \\"The Poison Sky\\", and ending with \\"The Doctor's Daughter\\", in which she meets The Doctor's new companion Donna Noble (Catherine Tate); in the first episode, a more assertive and engaged Martha summons The Doctor to Earth to help uncover a plot by the Sontarans. Martha returns again for the final two episodes of the series, \\"The Stolen Earth\\" and \\"Journey's End\\", where she has been promoted to a US division of UNIT and is working on a top secret teleportation project based on Sontaran technology. She rallies alongside fellow companions Jack and Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) in an effort to face the threat of Davros' (Julian Bleach) plot to destroy reality. In facing Davros, Martha threatens to set off nuclear warheads which will destroy the Earth in order to spare human suffering and curtail his plans, but is stopped by The Doctor. In the episode's dénouement, Martha leaves with Jack and former companion Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke), with Jack saying to her \\"I'm not sure about UNIT these days... maybe there's something else you could be doing.\\" Despite the set up at the end of Doctor Who series four, Martha does not appear in Torchwood: Children of Earth (2009). Martha's absence is explained when the characters interact with UNIT officers in Children of Earth; she is on her honeymoon. In lieu of Martha, the character of Lois Habiba (Cush Jumbo) was created. A scene in \\"The End of Time\\" (2010) shows Martha fighting aliens with Mickey and married to him, rather than her previous fiancé. The Doctor appears to the pair shortly before his pending regeneration to save them from a Sontaran sniper. Agyeman is credited as portraying Martha Smith-Jones. Literature Aside from television appearances, the character of Martha also appears in Doctor Who novels and comic books, some of which are ambiguous in terms of their canonicity in relationship to the television series. In books, Martha appears in the \\"New Series Adventures\\" series of Doctor Who novels, published by BBC Books. The first book published was a \\"Quick Reads\\" novel, Made of Steel by Terrance Dicks (published prior to her first television appearance), and the character subsequently appeared in all novels in the series, starting with Sting of the Zygons by Stephen Cole and most recently in The Many Hands by Dale Smith. Freema Agyeman physically represents the character on the cover of every novel. In late 2008 The Story of Martha, a collection of stories focusing on Martha's adventures between \\"The Sound of Drums\\" and \\"Last of the Time Lords\\" was published.http://www.gallifreyone.com/cgi- bin/viewnews.cgi?id=EkEkyVyuFAkLljcpKZ&tmpl;=newsrss&style;=feedstyle In terms of comic book appearances, Martha has appeared in the Doctor Who Magazine strips from #381 onwards and the Doctor Who Adventures comics from #28 onwards. The character also appears in the Battles in Time series of comic books periodically. In 2007, American comic book publisher IDW Publishing (publisher of various Angel, Star Trek and The Transformers comic titles) announced their plans to do a devoted series of Tenth Doctor and Martha comics for an American audience. When asked about canonicity, IDW executive editor Chris Ryall dodged the issue by saying all the comics are \\"blessed\\" by Russell T Davies but it is up to the individual how canonical each story is. Audio drama Martha also appears in a BBC Radio 4 Torchwood drama, \\"Lost Souls\\" which aired in Summer 2008 as an Afternoon Play featuring the voices of the Torchwood cast and Freema Agyeman. Set between the events of the 2008 series of Torchwood but prior to the Doctor Who finale that year, Martha recruits Jack, Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd) and Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) on Torchwood's first international adventure, as part of Radio 4's special celebration of the Large Hadron Collider being switched on at CERN in Geneva. The special radio episode's plot focuses on the Large Hadron Collider's activation and the doomsday scenario some predicted it might incite, as well as the Torchwood team's mourning of Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) and Owen's recent deaths in the Torchwood second series finale. Martha made her Big Finish Productions debut in the Torchwood audio drama \\"Dissected\\", released in February 2020. Characterisation Conception The introduction of Martha as the next companion after Billie Piper's Rose Tyler was announced by the BBC in a 5 July 2006 press release. The character is a 23-year-old medical student from 2008,. although earlier in the conception process she had been meant to come from the year 1914. Like Rose, Martha has family members who are seen in the programme: Adjoa Andoh plays her mother Francine, with Trevor Laird as her father Clive (divorced from Francine), Gugu Mbatha-Raw as her sister Tish, and Reggie Yates as her brother Leo. Nevertheless, Agyeman notes that Martha is \\"very independent\\"; living alone and having almost completed her medical qualifications. She does not have an ex-boyfriend, but writer Russell T Davies has stated that she is not a lesbian, as had been rumoured in some quarters. An article in The Times speculated that, since Agyeman has martial arts skills, she may have \\"a more physical approach\\" to the role. As with her predecessor Rose, Martha is from London; Brett Mills from the University of East Anglia presumes this is because characters from the capital of the country are \\"therefore relatable to all British people\\" because they are seen as \\"neutral\\". Freema Agyeman told the school publication The Newspaper that Martha is older and more secure than Rose. Agyeman speculated that Martha, by contrast, travels with the Doctor for the adventure, rather than because of a need for guidance or education (Agyeman also told The Newspaper that Martha hopes to eventually go back to Earth and finish her medical education). In addition, Martha's family appears to be of a higher social class than Rose; whereas Rose's family was fairly typically working class, Martha's family appears to be wealthier (her father owns what appears to be a late model Mercedes-Benz convertible, and the clothes worn by her family are substantially more in line with fashion), probably middle to upper middle class. Drawing from her creator's pool of recurring names, Martha and her family share the last name \\"Jones\\" with many other Russell T Davies-penned characters. Foremost among them are Harriet Jones in Doctor Who, Ianto Jones and Eugene Jones in Torchwood, Ianto Jones in Mine All Mine and Stuart Allen Jones in Queer as Folk. Davies states that reusing names (such as Tyler, Smith, Harper, Harkness and Jones) allows him to get a grip of the character on the blank page. In casting Martha, the actress Freema Agyeman was reused from her minor role as Adeola Oshodi, in the Series 2 episode \\"Army of Ghosts\\". Acknowledging this, the resemblance of the two characters was touched upon in \\"Smith and Jones\\" when Martha makes reference to her deceased cousin, also serving to connect Martha to the larger Doctor Who universe. Development Throughout Doctor Who series three, Martha pined for the Doctor's affection. In its final story — \\"Last of the Time Lords\\", Martha was separated from the Doctor for a year, and after saving the world she decided to return to Earth to allow herself to qualify as a medical doctor, look after her devastated family, and get over the Doctor's inability to reciprocate her feelings. Following the airdate of \\"Last of the Time Lords\\", the BBC announced that the character would return to screens in three episodes of Torchwood Series 2, before rejoining David Tennant's Tenth Doctor alongside new companion Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) for five episodes in the fourth series of Doctor Who. Appearing in Torchwood, it is explained through exposition that Martha is a medical specialist for UNIT, a qualified doctor and bona fide expert on alien life. First appearing on the spin-off series in Torchwood episode \\"Reset\\", fellow companion Jack Harkness establishes Martha's credibility to her new peers, slyly commenting upon her vast experience. John Barrowman noted that in many ways Martha entered Torchwood as their superior as being employed with UNIT placed her in a higher authority. In the same episode, Martha notes that an \\"impeccable source\\" recommended her employment to UNIT, implying the Doctor holds the highest level of faith in Martha's capability. Her Torchwood outfit was specifically designed to reflect her development, with Costume designer Ray Holman stating: \\"We wanted to give her that air of authority, with some professional-looking and quite classy fitted suits\\". Martha is first seen in action with UNIT in \\"The Sontaran Stratagem\\", where Donna Noble, the Doctor's current companion, reacts with shock asking derisively if the Doctor turns all of his companions into \\"soldiers\\". The Doctor also appears to disapprove over the situation until Martha defends her intentions, reminding the Doctor that she herself does not carry a gun, and stating that she is trying to make UNIT \\"better\\" from the inside. Agyeman herself states that she was never in any worry about Martha becoming too gun- toting: > \\"I never felt any danger of that happening. At the end of Series Three, > she'd struggled for a year, and travelled alone, and saw all this hardship, > her family tortured... that's going to have affected her. At the same time, > she's continued in her studies to become a doctor, so obviously she still > has this caring side to her\\". Martha tells Owen in the Torchwood episode \\"Reset\\", that she has a boyfriend, who is revealed to be paediatric doctor Thomas Milligan in \\"The Sontaran Stratagem\\", by which time the two are engaged — indicating that Martha has gotten over her love for the Doctor. In \\"The Poison Sky\\" she cites her relationship with Thomas Milligan as a reason to stay on Earth, rather than join Donna and Doctor in the TARDIS - saying that she's now got a great big adventure of her own to enjoy. Agyeman feels that Martha's relationship with Tom has \\"helped cement where she is in life\\". Agyeman also feels that it was important for Martha's mother Francine to re-appear in \\"The Stolen Earth\\"/\\"Journey's End\\", as closure for what happened to the Jones family in Series Three: \\"It's great for the audience to know that all this talk of Martha wanting to stay on earth because of her family is for real. It's great to see Adjoa there, representing the Jones clan, even though it's a fleeting appearance. She's still very much in Martha's life\\". Director Euros Lyn comments that the production team had intended for Agyeman and Clarke to join Torchwood for its third series, but their careers led them elsewhere. When the characters interact with UNIT officers in Children of Earth, Martha's absence is explained by her being on honeymoon. Head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies explains that Agyeman was cast in Law & Order: UK before Children of Earth had been officially commissioned. Because Law & Order offered her 13 episodes a year, she went with that over Torchwood which had been reduced to 5. In response, Davies created the character of Lois Habiba, played by Cush Jumbo, to be a \\"kind of a Martha figure\\", one with added innocence who is out of her depth. Agyeman does not rule out returning to the show at a later date, however. Davies reveals in his non-fiction book Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale that Martha was also intended to appear in The Sarah Jane Adventures series two finale Enemy of the Bane in December 2008, but the character had to be replaced with classic series character Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney) \\"at the last minute\\" due to Agyeman's role in Law & Order: UK; had Martha appeared, the character would have appeared in all three programmes in the franchise. Analyses Academic analyses of the character typically focus on the character's ethnicity (Agyeman herself was born to Ghanaian and Iranian parents), her social class (middle), and her status as a role model to young viewers. Martha has been described in newspaper reports as the \\"first ethnic-minority companion in the 43-year television history of Doctor Who\\". Martha's status as \\"first black companion\\" depends on whether Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) is considered a companion in the 2006 series. In her introduction, Martha is represented as being 'normal' in ways previous Doctor Who companions were not. For example, she becomes the first character to use light swear words when she exclaims \\"We're on the bloody moon!\\" Davies felt that this level of swearing was both normal and appropriate, citing a Harry Potter film in which the young audience reacted with laughter rather than shock when a young character cursed \\"Bloody hell\\".Carr, Jennifer; Whitelegg, Elizabeth; Holliman, Richard; Scanlon, Eileen and Hodgson, Barbara (2009). \\"(In)visible Witnesses: Drawing on young people’s media literacy skills to explore gendered representations of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\\" UKRC, Bradford, UK. In some instances, Martha's status as a middle-class woman distinguish her from earlier black companion Mickey Smith, who is male and, like Rose Tyler, working-class. Articles which focus on Martha's race normally attempt to make distinctions between Martha's social status and that of Mickey, and to what extent race or class play a part. Racial issues In contrast to Rose and Mickey, Martha is middle-class and university-educated; for Michael and Margaret Rustin of the University of East London, Mickey's constant struggle for respect and recognition from the Doctor in the first two series was a \\"subtle exploration ... of the dynamics of multi-ethnic life in contemporary Britain\\". The Rustins argue that in introducing Martha the series \\"catches hold\\" of the fact \\"that black women have in general been more successful educationally and professionally than black men in contemporary Britain.\\" As a black time traveller, the series' writers have used the character's presence as a means of injecting social commentary, tackling social issues such as racism in both bygone eras as well as the present day. As a black time traveller, the character of Martha allows Doctor Who to explore historical issues concerning race. In the episode \\"The Shakespeare Code\\", Martha wonders if she is safe in an era before emancipation, but the Doctor is unconcerned. The Doctor points out to Martha (also the audience surrogate) that England in 1599 is \\"not so different from your time\\"; black women are seen walking amongst the crowd at home and safe, and Martha identifies several cross- dressing actors. Martha soon reacts with surprise and possible offence to William Shakespeare's use of Elizabethan terms for black people such as \\"blackamoor\\" and \\"ethiop\\". For a moment, she thinks these terms could be racist (the Doctor quips that it is \\"political correctness gone mad\\"), but realises Shakespeare is actually enamoured of her. At the end of the episode, he calls her his \\"Dark Lady\\", the name given to the woman the real Shakespeare referred to in a number of Shakespeare's sonnets;Sonnets CXXVII-CLIV by implication, Martha is the Dark Lady. Lindy A. Orthia opines that such Tenth Doctor era representations of \\"Earth’s past as a place of happy and benign diversity\\" may be anti-racist in intention, but ultimately trivialise the racism that she claims has \\"infested\\" Western society for centuries. Such representations include visions of \\"Depression-era New York [containing] mixed-race shanty towns led by a black man (\\"Daleks in Manhattan\\"), while black women populate the streets and royal courts of Victorian England and Enlightenment France\\". Other episodes such as \\"Human Nature\\"/\\"The Family of Blood\\", set in 1913, depict the racism of an earlier era (Edwardian era). For Orthia, the few Doctor Who serials that explicitly depict racism \\"are remarkable by their presence: they carry rhetorical power because they are so rare in Doctor Who.\\" In \\"Human Nature\\", in addition to the racist jibes of private school boys, \\"we bear witness to how things have changed, when a white nurse refuses to believe that Martha is a medical student in the future, saying, \\"Women might train to be doctors, but hardly a skivvy and hardly one of your colour.\\"\\" When the TARDIS crew are nationally branded as terrorists in \\"The Sound of Drums\\", the Master (Simm) says that the Doctor's current companions \\"tick every demographic box\\" – referring to Martha's gender and ethnicity and Jack's sexual orientation. He later refers to Jack (Barrowman) and Martha as \\"the girlie and the freak\\", adding to the insult by claiming he is not sure which is which. Episodes set in the future, Orthia notes, are more often than not inclusive and \\"cosmopolitan\\" projections of societies which are as multi-racial (though not multi-ethnic) and sexually liberal as the present, if not more so. In 2009, Martha was listed among the top 20 Black Sci-Fi Icons by Entertainment Weekly. Female role model As a young medical professional, Martha has been the focus of studies which discuss young girls' perceptions of \\"gendered representations of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)\\". Through questionnaires, researchers for The UK Resource Centre for Women in Science, Engineering Technology asked Key Stage 3, KS4 and KS5-age students to \\"identify three of their favourite television programmes and to try and recall, and describe, a television programme they had watched that was about science or included a scientist.\\" The researchers narrowed down these selections to just two programmes which \\"feature within the favourite programmes for both boys and girls... The Simpsons (Channel 4) and Doctor Who (BBC).\\" The research was further analysed \\"the representation of STEM-related topics\\" through the programme's two prominent, respective, female characters: Lisa Simpson (Yeardley Smith) and Martha Jones; these characters were selected in light of Steinke. et al.'s suggestion that \\"presenting positive televised images of women scientists may be a particularly effective strategy for providing role models to promote girls' interest in science, particularly when direct interaction with human role models is not possible\\". The article points out that Martha and Lisa are quite different: primarily, \\"Lisa is represented as being different from many of her peers... a ‘child genius’... considered to be 'extraordinary'\\", whereas Martha \\"is represented as being a comparatively 'normal' young woman\\", who unlike Lisa invites self-identification. Martha's attempts to diagnose a patient in her debut episode is criticised as faulty; it is her \\"responses to the extraordinary situations that she later finds herself in, rather than her everyday life\\" which distinguish Martha. Her \\"normal\\" status is also highlighted when she becomes the first character \\"to be heard swearing\\" in Doctor Who. In spite of their differences, however, many commonalities were brought to light by the research. Lisa and Martha are both represented as characters who, rather than lacking social skills, play \\"a central role within their families' relationships\\" (David X. Cohen describes Lisa as \\"the heart of the family\\", Davies describes Martha as a \\"sort of peace-maker within her family\\"); \\"Martha’s family,\\" the article says, \\"and her relationships with them, are part of the narrative that runs throughout the series\\", who are her constant despite the time travel aspect of the series. \\"[H]owever fantastic and 'unreal' the experiences of Martha and Lisa might be, their characters are always situated within a set of family relationships that most viewers would recognise as being fairly commonplace.\\" Whereas in The Simpsons, Lisa is the character most identified with knowledge and worldliness, in Doctor Who that character is the Doctor. The power relationship this affords the Doctor and Martha is challenged, in Martha's favour, for the first time in \\"42\\", when an alien possession leaves the Doctor \\"scared\\"; according to Agyeman, Martha \\"has to take control\\". This independence is continued in \\"Human Nature\\"/\\"The Family of Blood\\", of which Davies says \\"Martha is left facing the monsters alone. The whole story wouldn’t work if the Doctor didn’t trust Martha\\". Martha also is asked to save the world singlehandedly in \\"The Sound of Drums\\"/\\"Last of the Time Lords\\". When Martha next appears in Torchwood, as a UNIT officer and qualified M.D., \\"the audience has been able to follow Martha’s career and watch her gain in both expertise and confidence.\\" In their summary, the researchers concluded: \\"In discussing our analysis of [Lisa Simpson and Martha Jones] we have highlighted ways in which they could be viewed both as characters with which young people can identify, but also as characters that provide positive role models in terms of their relationship to STEM.

The PTS defines its mission as \\"supporting the development of sociology and popularizing sociological knowledge within society\\". Currently the organization states to have approx. 1,000 members, out of which the majority are employed by universities or research institutions. Full membership requires a degree in sociology, a related discipline, or any other discipline if the applicant has an established body of work in sociology. Undergraduate students and may register as associated members. Honorary members include James S. Coleman and Shmuel Eisenstadt. Its seat is in Warsaw with regional offices in Białystok, Gdańsk, Katowice, Kraków, Lublin, Łódź, Opole, Poznań, Rzeszów, Szczecin, Toruń, Warszawa, Wrocław, and Zielona Góra. The PTS publishes the quarterly English-language Polish Sociological Review (entitled Polish Sociological Bulletin from its inception in 1961 until 1993, and \\"Bibliographical Information\\"). It also organizes the Polish Sociologocial Convention (Ogólnopolski Zjazd Socjologiczny) in irregular intervals that average about three years. The PTS also operates a research institute offering social research services to public and private clients (Zakład Badań Naukowych PTS). The proceeds from its work contribute to the PTS budget.  History  In its present form, the PTS has had a continuous existence since 1956, but its history can be traced back to 1927, when Florian Znaniecki established the first Polish organization of sociologists under the name of \\"Polish Sociological Institute\\" (Polski Instytut Socjologiczny/PIS). Initially, the PIS combined the tasks of a research institute with the representation of sociologists across the country. In 1931, on the first ever national convention of sociologists in Poznań, separate professional organization under the name of Polskie Towarzystwo Socjologiczne (PTS) was created on Znaniecki's initiative. This association, one of the first of its type in Europe, co- existed with the PIS. Relatively little is known about its activities. Its first two presidents were Ludwik Krzywicki (1931-1935) and Stefan Czarnowski (1935-1938). In 1935, PTS and PIS jointly organized the second Polish Sociologocial Convention in Warsaw. Both bodies existed until the outbreak of World War II in 1939. Towards the end of the war, in 1944 the PIS was reactivated in the Soviet-controlled part of the country, but not so the PTS; some of its previous tasks were reassigned to the new PIS. In 1951, sociology was declared a \\"bourgeois\\" science in Poland. All sociological university departments and institutes, including the PIS, were closed, their employees transferred to neighbouring disciplines such as philosophy or history. After sociology had been readmitted to academic life in Poland in 1956, a group of sociologists at the universities of Warsaw and Łódź around Stanisław Ossowski set up a Sociological Section within the Polish Philosophical Association (Polskie Towarzystwo Filozoficzne), which became a member of the International Sociological Association (ISA) (of which Ossowski had already been a founding member in 1949). The following year, the section transformed into an independent body, adopting the traditional name Polskie Towarzystwo Socjologiczne. Ossowski was elected its first president, other founding board members included Nina Assorodobraj, Józef Chałasiński, Antonina Kłoskowska, Jan Lutyński, Stefan Nowak, Zygmunt Pióro, Jan Strzelecki and Jan Szczepański. During the time of communist rule in Poland, while academic life was highly formalized, hierarchically structured, and subject to political pressure, the PTS remained fully autonomous from government intervention, making it an attractive venue for unrestricted scholarly as well as political debate. However, lack of government support also constituted a constant problem for the organizational work of the PTS; e.g., the first post-war national convention did not take place until 1965.  Conventions  The first convention had the title I Konferencja Socjologów Polskich (\\"1st conference of Polish sociologist\\"), the second II Zjazd Socjologów Polskich (\\"2nd convention of Polish sociologists\\").

Greer State Highway Building is an eight-story structure in downtown Austin, Texas housing offices of the Texas Department of Transportation since its completion. Located at the southwest corner of 11th and Brazos Streets (125 E. 11th Street), the building was designed by San Antonio architect Carleton Adams and finished in 1933 at a cost of $455,000. It features elaborate Art Deco styling, including decorative carved limestone panels above the front doors. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places along with the 1918 State Office Building in 1998. Texas Historical Commission Marker Text Established April 4, 1917 - Early 20th century Texas farmers demanded all-weather access to markets just as automobiles revolutionized transportation for all travelers. Good-roads promoters envisioned a central state agency to organize safe, consistent routes. In 1916, the federal government offered matching funds to build a statewide highway system. In 1917, legislators created the Texas Highway Department, and Texans registered 195,000 automobiles. Agency employees worked in the Capitol, then the 1917 Land Office, and soon the agency opened district offices across the state. In 1921, federal officials approved a 2,900-mile Texas system, ensured by a one-cent-per-gallon state gas tax after 1923. During the Great Depression, federal relief funds stimulated massive road building. Engineers also promoted a new headquarters, and in 1933 completed this state highway building. From here, Dewitt Carlock Greer (1902–1986) served as state highway engineer, 1940–1967, and commissioner, 1969 to 1981, when legislators named the building for him. That year, as the agency's role expanded to public transportation, it managed 71,000 miles of highways for 12 million Texas vehicles.

Sophus Frederik Neble served as Editor from 1887 to 1931. Sophus Neble was a journeyman printer who had immigrated to the United States in 1883 from Stubbekøbing, Denmark. Den Danske Pioneer secured a new press at the Chicago Exposition in 1893. The press that was capable of printing 6,000 pages an hour.

Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume 28: Page 274) The Pioneer was developing and becoming the voice of the ethnic community. Datelines for stories were spread across the Midwest and journalist were sent as far east as Maine and Vermont in order to get stories. In 1958 the newspaper relocated to Elmwood Park, Illinois, where it was published until 1984. Hjalmar Bertelsen served as Editor from 1958 until 1981. Queen Margrethe II of Denmark visited the newspaper's Elmwood Park facilities during her visit to the United States in 1976. In 1997, Queen Margrethe II made then-editor Chris Steffensen a Knight of the Order of Dannebrog to commemorate the newspaper's 125th anniversary. Today the newspaper is a unit of Bertelsen Publishing Co., based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois.

Specimens have been collected on or under Eucalyptus bark, or on vegetation. They are small to medium, flattish jumping spiders with large, bulging, black- shiny 'eyes' on the rear of the abdomen, apparently to mimic flies. It is in the unident group, with one retromarginal tooth on the chelicera, two on the promargin opposite. Leg I is the strongest, while leg IV the longest. These spiders have been observed walking backwards, enhancing the mimicry affect. They are found mostly in Queensland, especially warmer parts, on vegetation and under the bark of gum trees. Specimens have been sighted at Darwin NT, Townsville QLD, Wooloolga, Gosford and Grafton NSW. A western Queensland species from Birdsville and a South Australian species from Lewiston have been documented.

Most species are distributed in Eastern to Northern Africa (including the Middle East) and Australia, with one species (A. epiblemoides) found in Europe. This genus was for a time included in the genus Pseudicius, and the boundaries between both genera are disputed. In 2016 Jerzy Prószyński erected the genus Psenuc for some borderline species. The name Afraflacilla is combined from Africa, where most earlier described species were found, and Flacilla Simon, 1901, an obsolete salticid genus now called Flacillula Strand, 1932. This genus name is in turn derived from Aelia Flaccilla, wife of Roman Emperor Theodosius I. Afraflacilla, Pseudicius, Festucula and Marchena are close relatives and form a monophyletic group. Afraflacilla species have tubercles and bristles (on the sides of the carapace near the eyes and on their legs) which they rub together to make sounds used in courtship and possibly defence. The line of small tubercles (sharp knobs) under the eyes on the side of the carapace are usually visible to the naked eye.  Afraflacilla in Australia  Afraflacilla species in Australia include A. grayorum, A. gunbar, A. huntorum, A. milledgei, A. stridulator, A. vestjensi and A. yeni. In Australia they occupy tree trunks in deserts, savanna woodland and in open sclerophyll forests from south west Western Australia to Cape York Queensland, mostly in warmer regions. There are many undescribed Australian species. Afraflacilla grayorum Grays' stridulating jumping spider, found in northern Australian deserts, was named in honour of Michael and Greta Gray. The male palpal organ of many Australian Afraflacilla species has a large, circling embolus (inseminating sclerite) and retro- lateral tibial apophysis (side spike). Some undescribed Australian Afraflacilla species have greatly enlarged segments of the first pair of legs, and sometimes massive spurs coming from underneath the tibia and metatarsus (third and second last leg segments). Enlarged leg-one segments are also a feature of Pseudicius, a genus widespread outside Australia. Species Palpal organs of two species of undescribed Australian Afraflacilla showing the obviously different places on the imaginary clock face at which the embolus arises. These are diagnostic for species, in combination with other characters. , the World Spider Catalog accepted the following species: * Afraflacilla antineae (Denis, 1954) – Algeria * Afraflacilla asorotica (Simon, 1890) – Saudi Arabia, Israel, Yemen * Afraflacilla bamakoi Berland & Millot, 1941 – Mali * Afraflacilla berlandi Denis, 1955 – Libya * Afraflacilla courti Zabka, 1993 – New Guinea * Afraflacilla elegans (Wesolowska & Cumming, 2008) - Zimbabwe, South Africa * Afraflacilla epiblemoides (Chyzer, 1891) – Central, Eastern Europe * Afraflacilla grayorum Zabka, 1993 – Western Australia, Queensland * Afraflacilla gunbar Zabka & Gray, 2002 – New South Wales * Afraflacilla huntorum Zabka, 1993 – Western Australia, Victoria * Afraflacilla risbeci Berland & Millot, 1941 – Senegal * Afraflacilla scenica Denis, 1955 – Niger * Afraflacilla similis Berland & Millot, 1941 – Senegal * Afraflacilla stridulator Zabka, 1993 – Western Australia * Afraflacilla vestjensi Zabka, 1993 – Northern Territory * Afraflacilla wadis (Prószynski, 1989) – Saudi Arabia, Israel, Yemen * Afraflacilla yeni Zabka, 1993 – Victoria  References  Category:Salticidae Category:Salticidae genera Category:Taxa named by Lucien Berland Category:Spiders of Africa Category:Spiders of Asia Category:Spiders of Australia ","title":"Afraflacilla"},{"id":"5825376","title":"Nacional de Clubes"},{"id":"5825377","text":"Afrobeata is a genus of jumping spiders that was first described by Lodovico di Caporiacco in 1941. it contains only three species, found only in Tanzania, Ethiopia, and on Socotra: A. firma, A. latithorax, and A. magnifica.

It is stored in lipid droplets that exist in close proximity to the mitochondria, where it serves as an energy store that can be used during exercise. In humans, excess accumulation of intramuscular fat has been associated with conditions such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-lipodystrophy syndrome is associated with over-accumulation of intramuscular fat, which may contribute to AIDS wasting syndrome. Diabetes Increased IMTG was once thought responsible for increased insulin resistance. However, the discovery that athletes as well as obese individuals have high IMTG levels confounded these findings. Instead, IMTG metabolites, such as diacylglycerol and ceramide are responsible for the insulin resistance. Studies demonstrating the effects of IMTGs show that the mechanism involves the activation of the protein kinase C theta, which promotes the phosphorylation of IRS-1, thereby inhibiting the insulin signaling cascade. Insulin Resistance Increased plasma free- fatty acid levels and increased accumulation of IMTG correlate well with insulin resistance in muscles. However, athletes often do not exhibit this correlation since they are typically insulin sensitive, while expressing high levels of IMTG. Researchers believe that the improved efficiency of trained skeletal muscles prevents the development of insulin resistance. Exercise Intramuscular triacylglycerol serves as an energy store that can be used during exercise, when it may contribute up to 20% of total energy turnover (depending on diet, gender, and exercise type). Scientists think that a low- calorie diet and exercise-induced proteins (Sterol regulatory element-binding protein) cause the high levels of IMTG in athletes' skeletal muscle. In contrast, the build-up of IMTG in obese individuals correlates to high levels of adipose tissue. Women have a higher IMTG content and studies have revealed that they use more IMTGs during exercise.

This was proved in 1996, so the term \\"Robbins algebra\\" is now simply a synonym for \\"Boolean algebra\\".  History In 1933, Edward Huntington proposed a new set of axioms for Boolean algebras, consisting of (1) and (2) above, plus: *Huntington's equation: eg( eg a \\\\lor b) \\\\lor eg( eg a \\\\lor eg b) = a. From these axioms, Huntington derived the usual axioms of Boolean algebra. Very soon thereafter, Herbert Robbins posed the Robbins conjecture, namely that the Huntington equation could be replaced with what came to be called the Robbins equation, and the result would still be Boolean algebra. \\\\lor would interpret Boolean join and eg Boolean complement. Boolean meet and the constants 0 and 1 are easily defined from the Robbins algebra primitives. Pending verification of the conjecture, the system of Robbins was called \\"Robbins algebra.\\" Verifying the Robbins conjecture required proving Huntington's equation, or some other axiomatization of a Boolean algebra, as theorems of a Robbins algebra. Huntington, Robbins, Alfred Tarski, and others worked on the problem, but failed to find a proof or counterexample. William McCune proved the conjecture in 1996, using the automated theorem prover EQP. For a complete proof of the Robbins conjecture in one consistent notation and following McCune closely, see Mann (2003). Dahn (1998) simplified McCune's machine proof.

The fort is located at Jalan Taiping-Kuala Sepetang road near Matang town. History The fort was built in the 1870s as the private residence of Ngah Ibrahim, a Malay statesman in Perak. After the murder of J.W.W. Birch, the first British Resident in Perak at Pasir Salak on 1 November 1875, the fort became a court for the trial of Birch's murder. Dato Maharajalela, Dato' Sagor, Sepuntum and Pandak Indut were found guilty and were sentenced to death by hanging at the court on 21 January 1877. Ngah Ibrahim, Sultan Abdullah and other statesmen were exiled to Seychelles in the Indian Ocean. Ngah Ibrahim died on 1887 in Singapore and was buried at the Masjid Al-Junied cemetery. However, on 7 September 2006, Ngah Ibrahim's body was brought back to Perak and reburied near his house. In the 1900s, the court was moved to a new building at Taiping. In 1913, the house was turned into the first Teachers' Training College for Malay teachers, known as the Matang College. Ten years later on 1923, the college was closed for the new Sultan Idris Training College in Tanjung Malim. Subsequently, the residence was turned into a primary school, Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan Matang. During the Japanese occupation in 1941, the Japanese Imperial Army made the fort its headquarters and war strategic operations centre. After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, the fort was turned again into Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan Matang until 1982 when the school was moved to the new building near the fort. From 1987, this fort was taken over by the Perak Museum Department as a state historical site known as Kota Ngah Ibrahim Historical Complex.

Chomsky. The film starred Helmut Berger, Linda Blair, Anthony Hopkins, Burt Lancaster, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Dreyfuss, and Kirk Douglas. Julius Harris portrayed Idi Amin, following the fatal heart attack suffered by the actor originally cast in the role, Godfrey Cambridge.Buford 2008, p. 783. The film was theatrically released in Europe. Victory at Entebbe is based on the actual event Operation Entebbe, the raid on Entebbe Airport (now Entebbe International Airport) in Uganda and the freeing of Israeli hostages on July 4, 1976. It was the first of three films made in the 1970s based on the Entebbe Raid. The other two, Raid on Entebbe (1977) and Operation Thunderbolt (1977) soon followed.Barron 2016, p. 209. A fourth film, Entebbe (titled 7 Days in Entebbe in the U.S.) was released over four decades later in 2018. Plot On June 27, 1976, four terrorists belonging to a splinter group of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine under the orders of Wadie Haddad boarded and hijacked an Air France Airbus A300 in Athens, Greece. With the permission of President Idi Amin (Julius Harris), the terrorists divert the airliner and its hostages to Entebbe Airport in Uganda. After identifying Israeli passengers, the non- Jewish passengers are freed while a series of demands are made, including the release of 40 Palestinian militants held in Israel, in exchange for the hostages. The Cabinet of Israel, led by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin (Anthony Hopkins), unwilling to give in to terrorist demands, plans a top-secret military raid. This commando operation, military code name: \\"Operation Thunderbolt\\", will be carried out over from home and will take place on the Jewish Sabbath. While still negotiating with the terrorists, who now numbered seven individuals, the Israeli military prepared two Lockheed C-130 Hercules transports for the raid. The transports refuelled in Kenya before landing at Entebbe Airport under the cover of darkness. The commandos led by Brigadier General Dan Shomron (Harris Yulin) had to contend with a large armed Ugandan military detachment and used a ruse to overcome the defenses. A black Mercedes limousine had been carried on board and was used to fool sentries that it was the official car which President Amin used on an impromptu visit to the airport. Nearly complete surprise was achieved but a firefight resulted, ending with all seven terrorists and 45 Ugandan soldiers killed. The hostages were gathered together and most were quickly put on the idling C-130 aircraft. During the raid, one commando (the breach unit commander Yonatan Netanyahu (Richard Dreyfuss), brother of future Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu), and three of the hostages died. With 102 hostages aboard and on their way to freedom, a group of Israeli commandos remained behind to destroy the Ugandan Air Force MiG-17 and MiG-21 fighters to prevent a retaliation. All the survivors of the attack force then joined in flying back to Israel via Nairobi and Sharm El Sheikh. Cast In alphabetical order: * Helmut Berger as Wilfried Böse * Linda Blair as Chana Vilnofsky * Kirk Douglas as Hershel Vilnofsky * Richard Dreyfuss as Col. Yoni Netanyahu * Helen Hayes as Etta Grossman Wise * David Groh as Benjamin Wise * Anthony Hopkins as Yitzhak Rabin * Burt Lancaster as Shimon Peres * Elizabeth Taylor as Edra Vilnofsky * Julius Harris as Idi Amin * Theodore Bikel as Yakov Shlomo * Harris Yulin as Gen. Dan Shomron * Christian Marquand as Captain Dukas * Jessica Walter as Nomi Haroun * Stefan Gierasch as Gen. Gur * David Sheiner as Aaron Olav * Severn Darden as Moshe Meyer * Allan Miller as Nathan Haroun * Bibi Besch as German Woman (Brigitte Kuhlmann) Production Victory at Entebbe was filmed on videotape at Burbank Studios in California and later transferred to film for distribution around the world, giving the film the slightly stilted visual style of a studio-bound TV drama, but with a film-like look, and big Hollywood names in the cast. Shooting on video shortened the production time, allowing the film to be ready for television less than six months after the event that inspired it. Reception Although both telefilms Victory at Entebbe and Raid on Entebbe relied on their star-studded casts, neither were able to make much of an impact with audiences. The portrayal of the heroic Israeli military in Victory at Entebbe, however, led to radical pro-Palestinian terrorists placing bombs in Germany and Italy, alleging that the film was Zionist propaganda. Victory at Entebbe was recognized at the 29th Primetime Emmy Awards, where screenwriter Ernest Kinoy received an Emmy Award nomination for his teleplay.\\"1977 Primetime Emmy Awards.\\" IMDb.

As of 2019, this Genus contained 10 species. The Ascyltus spiders utilize their vision in courtship, hunting, and navigation. Ascyltus are typically large to medium sized Salticids and often move relatively slow. However, they are capable of agile jumps when moving, hunting, or to avoid predators. They have well developed _book lungs_ and tracheal systems, and they are capable of utilizing both systems (bimodal breathing). Ascyltus have four pairs of eyes, with the anterior median pair being the most prominent. One distinguishable characteristic of the Ascyltus include their antero-lateral carapace, which is iridescently colored.  Distinguishing characteristics  Ascyltus are relatively large to medium sized salticids. Distinguishable from other Pacific salticids by their antero-lateral carapace, which is iridescently colored. In addition to being iridescently colored, their antero-lateral carapace is typically widened even at a juvenile age. Like other members of the Salticidae, Ascyltus have four pairs of eyes in three rows. The anterior median eyes are noticeably more prominent than the others. Palpal structures are similar among all Ascyltus species.  Size  * Males average 13-19 millimeters * Females average 16-20 millimeters  Geographic distribution  The majority of Ascyltus species live in Oceania, having a widespread distribution across the Pacific islands. Some Ascyltus have also been found in the Hawaiian islands.  Diet  Ascyltus are carnivorous, so their diet mainly consists of insects around the tropical region. They capture the majority of their food by stalking or hunting prey. This includes many flies, crickets, and small grasshoppers.  Hunting  The Ascyltus jumping spider relies on visual stimuli when catching prey. The anterior-lateral eyes function to track moving objects. The anterior-median eyes are essential for the stalking of prey because of their telescopic abilities. Ascyltus spiders typically employ one of three set of responses to catch prey. The responses are a set of motor movements as follows: Alignment Pursuit - follow, run, stalk; Orientation - alert, swivel; and Capture - crouch and jump. The distance separating the spider from its prey are the determining factor in the response pattern used.

It is a collaboration between the Jazz Messengers, the group led by drummer Art Blakey, and Thelonious Monk on piano.  Background  Throughout the preceding decade, on sessions for both Blue Note and Riverside, Blakey had supported Monk on various occasions. Monk returned the favor on this one-off session for Atlantic. Blakey was on the verge of beginning a long-term contract with Blue Note, while Monk was in the middle of his stay on Riverside. One month after these recordings, Monk would begin his summer and autumn residency at the Five Spot on Cooper Square after regaining his cabaret card, without which he had been barred from playing in most of New York City's clubs. Monk's quartet featuring John Coltrane at that residency would bring Monk fame beyond the inner circle of jazz aficionados. Atlantic released this album over a year after it was recorded, thereby capitalizing on Monk's increased visibility.  Reception  Billboard in 1958 gave the album three stars out of four, stating that it has some \\"mighty good jazz\\".\\"Reviews and ratings of new jazz records\\" (May 12, 1958) Billboard, p. 23.

The name is a diminutive form of a common prefix for salticid genera, '. Taxonomy In 1889, Eugène Simon separated the genus Attulus from the genus Attus. The correct name of the type species involves some taxonomic complexity. Simon gave Attus cinereus Westring, 1861 as the type of the genus. However, this name had already been used by Walckenaer in 1837 for a different species, so Simon's 1871 replacement name Attus helveolus is used instead. A. helveolus is now regarded as the same species as Attus distinguendus, described by Simon in 1868, so having priority as a name. Thus the type species is currently known as Attulus distinguendus. Within the family Salticidae, Attulus is placed in the tribe Sitticini (the sitticines). The taxonomy of the tribe and the genus Attulus has been subject to considerable uncertainty; some species changed genus repeatedly between 2017 and 2020. For example, Attulus floricola was known as Sitticus floricola until moved to Sittiflor floricola in 2017, to Calositticus floricola in 2018, back to Sitticus floricola in 2019, and then to Attulus floricola in 2020. Most sitticines were placed in Sitticus until 2017, when Jerzy Prószyński split the genus into seven: Attulus, Sitticus and five new genera Sittiab, Sittiflor, Sittilong, Sittipub and Sittisax. This division was not based on a phylogenetic analysis but was intended to be \\"pragmatic\\". A molecular phylogenetic analysis in 2020 restored most sitticine species to a single genus. Although Sitticus had been used in this sense for a long time, Attulus Simon, 1889 has priority over Sitticus Simon, 1901, so is the name currently used. Attulus is circumscribed to include Sitticus, Sittiflor, Sittilong and Sittipub. (Prószyński's Sittisax was retained, but his Sittiab was synonymized with Attinella.) Phylogeny In 2020, Wayne Maddison and co-workers divided the tribe Sitticini into two subtribes, Aillutticina and Sitticina. Attulus was placed in Sitticina, and divided into three subgenera, A.

A variant of the technique has shown to be useful in several natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as Google's SentencePiece, and OpenAI's GPT-3.

Now there is the following data and replacement table: ZabdZabac Z=aa Then the process is repeated with byte pair \\"ab\\", replacing it with Y: ZYdZYac Y=ab Z=aa The only literal byte pair left occurs only once, and the encoding might stop here. Or the process could continue with recursive byte pair encoding, replacing \\"ZY\\" with \\"X\\": XdXac X=ZY Y=ab Z=aa This data cannot be compressed further by byte pair encoding because there are no pairs of bytes that occur more than once.

Their music could be described as dream pop with female vocals; they are sometimes labeled trip hop, but the band rejects that label. History Ryan and Rebecca met in 1992 as the drummer and vocalist for the Santa Cruz-based band Anomie. That group would change Ryan's musical focus from techno pop (as the main keyboardist of Thinner) to more ambient guitar work, and transform Rebecca from a riot girl enthusiast into someone more at home with 4AD. Anomie's shoegaze sound met with rapid success in Santa Cruz on the strength of their album Burgundy Girl. The band later moved to San Francisco before the group split into two bands. In late 1995 Ryan and Rebecca's half formed \\"anymore\\" (as in: \\"We're not Anomie anymore.\\") and released two CDs. After \\"anymore\\" dissolved, they became Halou, releasing their debut album, We Only Love You in 1998, on a small, independent label called Bedazzled. We Only Love You was followed by a compilation of non-album tracks entitled Sans Soucie in 1999. Their second album, Wiser, was released by Nettwerk in 2001, while the more recent, Wholeness & Separation and Halou, were released by Vertebrae in 2006 and 2008 respectively. Halou's first album was broadcast on influential independent radio stations in Seattle and Los Angeles. In recent years, the band has received coverage from notable news sources, and they have been recognized for their production talents: In 2008, Halou announced that they would no longer be making music under the moniker, and the three part collaboration was over. Rebecca and Ryan Coseboom continue to perform together under the name Stripmall Architecture. Count continues to be involved in music as a producer and engineer, and is a member of a band called inu. In late 2015 Halou went back into the studio to record, releasing the track Stillbreathing on November 2, 2015.

Gries (University of California, Santa Barbara) and Anatol Stefanowitsch (Free University of Berlin). Collostructional analysis aims at measuring the degree of attraction or repulsion that words exhibit to constructions, where the notion of construction has so far been that of Goldberg's construction grammar. Collostructional methods Collostructional analysis so far comprises three different methods: * collexeme analysis, to measure the degree of attraction/repulsion of a lemma to a slot in one particular construction; * distinctive collexeme analysis, to measure the preference of a lemma to one particular construction over another, functionally similar construction; multiple distinctive collexeme analysis extends this approach to more than two alternative constructions; * covarying collexeme analysis, to measure the degree of attraction of lemmas in one slot of a construction to lemmas in another slot of the same construction. Input frequencies Collostructional analysis requires frequencies of words and constructions and is similar to a wide variety of collocation statistics. It differs from raw frequency counts by providing not only observed co-occurrence frequencies of words and constructions, but also (i) a comparison of the observed frequency to the one expected by chance; thus, collostructional analysis can distinguish attraction and repulsion of words and constructions; (ii) a measure of the strength of the attraction or repulsion; this is usually the log-transformed p-value of a Fisher-Yates exact test. Versus other collocation statistics Collostructional analysis differs from most collocation statistics such that (i) it measures not the association of words to words, but of words to syntactic patterns or constructions; thus, it takes syntactic structure more seriously than most collocation-based analyses; (ii) it has so far only used the most precise statistics, namely the Fisher-Yates exact test based on the hypergeometric distribution; thus, unlike t-scores, z-scores, chi-square tests etc., the analysis is not based on, and does not violate, any distributional assumptions.

Diet and behaviour At least 2 species, Brettus cingulatus and Brettus adonis, feed on other spiders.

Cardiff Corporation Waterworks obtained an Act of Parliament in 1884 to authorise construction of the reservoirs, to increase the water supply for Cardiff, but construction of Llwyn-on Reservoir did not start until 1911 and was completed in the 1920s. The reservoir, which has been owned and managed by Welsh Water and its predecessor organisation, the Welsh Water Authority, since 1973, is located within the Brecon Beacons National Park with its eastern half in the Merthyr Tydfil unitary authority area and the western half in Rhondda Cynon Taf. The village of Llwyn-On is nearby and the A470 trunk road runs along its eastern shoreline. History The reservoir dam Cardiff Corporation had bought out the Cardiff Waterworks Company in 1879, and in March 1881 asked their Borough Engineer, John Avery Brandon Williams, to produce a report on all possible sources of water for Cardiff, so that they could plan for the future. Williams presented his reports in May and August 1881, suggesting that the best scheme was to impound the waters of the upper Taff Fawr. After consulting the water engineer John Frederick Bateman, who also recommended the Taff Fawr scheme in June 1882 as the one most likely to meet the needs for water at the lowest cost, the Corporation presented a bill to Parliament in November 1883, which was considered by a House of Commons Committee between 1 May and 20 May 1884. It faced serious opposition from riparian landowners and there were 16 petitions against it, but several influential civil engineers was called to give evidence, notably Bateman, Thomas Hawksley James Mansergh, and George H. Hill. J A B Williams, their own Engineer, and the meteorologist George James Symonds also gave evidence, and although it cost the Corporation £3,652 to fight the case, Royal Assent was obtained for the Cardiff Corporation Act 1884, a private Act of Parliament, on 7 August. The catchment of the upper Taff Fawr was but it was split into an upper area of and a lower one of . Any works had to provide compensation water to maintain the flow in the Taff Fawr, and working on the upper area first meant that they only had to supply per day of compensation flow until work started on the lower area. Cantref Reservoir, at the time known as Cantreff, was the first to be built, together with a pipeline to Lisvane Reservoir and Llanishen Reservoir and intermediate balancing reservoirs at Blackbrook, Cefn, and Rhiwbina. Work on the pipeline was completed in September 1888, and on the balancing reservoirs in November 1888. Cantref Reservoir was completed on 14 September 1892, and Beacons Reservoir was completed on 30 September 1897. For Llwyn-on Reservoir, the 1884 Act specified a dam on the River Taf Fawr upstream from Merthyr Tydfil to create a reservoir with a capacity of . During 1902, the Corporation looked at increasing its capacity, so that Cantref and Beacons could be used exclusively for water supply, and all of the compensation flow for the Taf Fawr, which would then be per day, could be provided by the new reservoir. They also looked at the possibility of building a fourth reservoir between Llwyn-on and Cantref. They had purchased of land which was adequate for the original reservoir, but considered buying more land. When the Corporation decided to proceed, they elected for a reservoir that was considerably bigger than their 1902 plans, and in 1909, a new Act was obtained that doubled the permitted size to . Pre-war construction For the upper two reservoirs, materials had been moved to site by a standard gauge private railway, which was eventually long, running from a junction with the main line at Cefn-coed- y-cymmer to Beacons Reservoir. Once Beacons was completed, the upper sections of the railway were lifted, and it terminated near a small bridge that carried the road to Penderyn over the Taf Fawr, above the location for the new dam. In November 1910, a contract worth £201,077 was awarded to the contractor Louis P Nott of Llanelly and Bristol, which gave him six years from January 1911 to complete the works. The railway from Cefn-coed-y-cymmer had been disused for twelve years, and his first job was to put it back into order, including reconstrucing the viaduct that carried it over the Taf Fawr just to the north of Cefn. A new engine shed was built at Cefn yard, and his first locomotive arrived soon afterwards, which was used to carry men from Cefn to the dam site each day. Llwynon House was renovated, for use by the Resident Engineer and his assistants, while offices and huts were constructed on both sides of the Brecon Road nearby. In the spring, a school and a mission room were built, with accommodation for the staff. Mr Hicken of the Navvy Mission Society arrived on 9 May and the Lord Bishop of Llandaff formally opened the mission room on 11 July. Workshops were erected to the west of the road, and huts to accommodate the navvies who lived on site were on higher ground to the east of it. Work to build the earthen dam started in January 1911, and by June the excavations had reached solid rock. An official inauguration ceremony was held on 28 June 1911, with the Lord Mayor and his party travelling from to on the Taff Vale Railway, but it is unclear how they got from there to Cefn yard for the journey onwards to Llwyn-on. During the ceremony, a keystone was laid, Mr Nott gave the Lord Mayor a trowel, and Charles Henry Priestley, the Waterworks Engineer, gave him a mallet. Afterwards, the mayoral party visited Cantref and Beacons Reservoirs. For the previous two reservoirs, stone had been obtained from Sychpant Quarry at Cefn, and this was reopened in the summer of 1911. Some granite was also obtained from the De Lank quarries at Bodmin in Cornwall. Clay for the puddle core of the dam was again obtained from a clay field belonging to Cyfarthfa Ironworks, which was by then managed by Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds, rather than the Crawshay Brothers. The field was at Pen- yr-Heolgerrig, and may have been the same one that was used for the previous reservoirs, although the minutes relating to this are not easy to follow. Nott built an engine shed and a connection to a private siding, but details are unclear as to whether it was standard gauge or narrow gauge. Removal of topsoil began on 4 December 1913, and by February 1914, clay was being extracted. The onset of the First World War caused a shortage of labour, and Nott reported this to the Corporation in October 1914. The quarry was partially closed from 1 February 1915, and closed completely on 23 October, while the clay pit was closed down on 3 November. The puddle trench was covered and sealed, and apart from a few men engaged in maintenance, all work stopped. By the time work ceased, Nott had constructed a water tunnel beneath the dam, and altered the course of the river, so that the works could proceed. The concrete foundations for the dam had been laid, and quite a lot of puddling had been completed. Ancillary work included the erection of a new chapel, Capel Bethel, to replace the one at Cwm Taf, which would be flooded when the reservoir was filled, and the diversion of the Brecon Road further to the east from below the dam site northwards to Abercar. Despite the fact that the work stopped on orders from HM Treasury, Nott started litigation as he was unhappy with the settlement he received. He died on 4 July 1916, but the Scottish civil engineer Robert Brodie was a good friend of the family, and continued the dispute throughout the war. It went to arbitration, but the Corporation appealed against the outcome, and the House of Lords finally decided in favour of the contractor in 1918. The costs of the case amounted to around £25,000, of which the Corporation had to pay £20,000. Post-war construction Having resolved to settle Nott's claim in January 1919, the Corporation decided to finish the reservoir using direct labour, and negotiated with Brodie, Nott's executor, to buy some of his plant, for which they paid £3,750. This included one of his six locomotives, Tuxford, which was repaired in July 1919 and put to work, after which it was joined by the second-hand Nelson. A new locomotive shed to house most of the six locomotives that worked on the railway during the Corporation era was completed in July 1919. It was located below the dam, and a locomotive shed was also built at the quarry, while one locomotive was normally kept in the shed at Cefn yard. Three second-hand four-wheeled coaches arrived in May 1920. The Corporation had bought the Cwm Taf estate from Lord Tredegar in the autumn of 1914, which included Nant-ddu Lodge, just below the Cantref dam, and the railway was extended back to Cantref in 1922, to facilitate the construction of new filters there. A workman's train ran from Cefn each morning, calling at the quarry, the dam and Cantref filters, returning in the evening. Progress on the project was disrupted by a long strike by navvies in the second half of 1920, and a coal strike in early 1921. Nott's accommodation huts were considered to be too basic by post-war standards, and so a new village was built to the west of the road to replace them. Work was made easier by the arrival of a steam navvy in May 1920, and another in January 1921, both of which worked on the bed of the reservoir. Near to Christmas 1921, Priestley, who was now 67, was given a closed Ford car to replace the open model which was not suitable for the cold and wet weather, although it did not arrive until 2 March 1922. In December 1921, the Corporation also decided they would run a school train to enable children from Llwyn-on to get to Cefn yard in the morning and back in the afternoon. A missioner from the Navvy Mission Society took up residence in February 1922, arriving from the Blaen-y-Cwm reservoir at Beaufort, where work had recently finished. Construction of the valve shaft began in July 1921, using stone imported from the Forest of Dean. The railway was extended into the bottom of the reservoir in early 1922, so that deliveries of stone to clad the inside face of the dam could be made more easily. The restoration of the link to Cantref was also completed in 1922, using a new route for part of it, to the west of the reservoir, and at a higher level than the original route that followed the valley floor. Beyond the top end of the reservoir, it re- joined the route that had been built in 1886. After a gap of nearly six years, puddling of the dam started again, but the clay was no longer obtained from Pen-yr-Heolgerrig, as a cheaper source was available near Neath, although deliveries by the contractor Stephens and Company were irregular, and clay was also obtained from Pengam. Supplies from both locations was delivered by rail, and 185 trucks of clay were delivered in the monthly period ending in mid-July 1922. A little over a year later, in the month to mid-October 1923, 175 wagons of clay were used in the construction, together with of material in 486 wagon loads for building the bank. By 1924, the steam navvies had done their job, and they were sold at auction, together with three of the locomotives. The Cantref filters were completed, and the railway from Llwyn-on to Cantref was lifted in April 1926, while Priestley retired in the same month. He had served the Waterworks Committee for 31 years, and was then aged 72. The Corporation were originally going to employ James Watson as the engineer for the project, who had designed a reservoir system for Bradford Corporation in the Nidd Valley, but he died before being appointed, and Priestley had taken up the role. Impounding of water in the reservoir began on 23 June 1926, when the Lord Mayor of Cardiff, Alderman W P Francis, partially closed the valves, and Cantref filters were inaugurated on the same day. Several auctions took place between then and 1928, at which surplus equipment was sold. Water levels in the reservoir reached their full height in November 1926, but formal commissioning did not take place until May 1927. The contractors village and workshops at Llwyn-on were removed in May 1928, and the railway down to Cefn may have been removed in early 1928, although there is also a suggestion that it was sold to T W Ward Ltd in 1930, in order that they might remove it. The reservoir is fed by the Afon Taf Fawr, and the smaller tributaries of the Nant Gwinau, Nant Car and Garwnant. Locomotives Louis Nott is known to have brought at least six locomotives to Llwyn-on during the early phase of the project. All had previously worked at Birkenhead, where he had built a dry dock for Cammell Laird. Three may have been requisitioned by the Ministry of Munitions during the First World War. After Nott died in 1916, Robert Brodie traded as Executor of L P Nott, and then Nott, Brodie. Brodie's companies re- purchased two of the locomotives. *Chepstow: 0-6-0 saddle tank, Manning Wardle 738 of 1881. May have gone to the Ministry of Munitions. *Norman: 0-6-0 saddle tank, Hunslet 454 of 1888. Subsequently worked at Eastleigh aerodrome, and then possibly for the Ministry of Munitions. *Sharpness: 0-6-0 side tank, Sharp Stewart 3472 of 1888. May have gone to the Ministry of Munitions. Bought by Brodie in 1922 for use on the construction of Avonmouth Portway. *Tuxford: 0-6-0 saddle tank, Hunslet 579 of 1893. Remained on site into Corporation era. *Liverpool: 0-4-0 saddle tank, Manning Wardle 1518 of 1901. Bought by Robert McAlpine & Sons in 1917. *Tranmere: 0-6-0 saddle tank, Hudswell Clarke 654 of 1903. Subsequently used on an ordnance factory project and then bought by Brodie in 1918 for use on the Blaen-y-Cwm reservoir and other projects. When Cardiff Corporation restarted the project in 1919, they acquired one locomotive from Nott's executors, two second-hand ones, and bought three new ones. *Tuxford: 0-6-0 saddle tank, Hunslet 579 of 1893. Acquired from Nott's executors. Repairs were made to it in 1919, but it was then mounted on blocks at Llwyn-on, to supply steam to a pump. *Nelson: 0-6-0 saddle tank, Kitson 1786 of 1871. It was driven from J F Wake's yard in Darlingon in September 1919. Some time after 1921, it was also mounted on blocks to power a stationary pump. *Dan-y-Graig: 0-6-0 saddle tank, Manning Wardle 835 of 1882. Brought from Swansea in July 1920. Later worked at the shipbreaking yard of T W Ward at Briton Ferry until the 1930s. *Llwyn-on: 0-6-0 saddle tank, Hudswell Clarke 1429 of 1920. Bought new. Some teething problems had to be fixed by the manufacturer. Sold to the dealers T W Ward of Sheffield on 30 September 1927, and finally scrapped around 1957 at Felsted in Essex. *Cwm Taff: 0-6-0 saddle tank, Hudswell Clarke 1466 of 1921. Sold to the dealers T W Ward of Sheffield on 30 September 1927, and subsequently worked at various locations, including the Ewden Valley Waterworks for Sheffield Corporation. *Abernant: 0-6-0 saddle tank, Manning Wardle 2015 of 1921. Sold to the dealers T W Ward of Sheffield on 30 September 1927. Worked at the Austin Motor Company at Longbridge until 1963, and was then moved to a children's playground in Birmingham. Subsequently preserved, and was awaiting restoration at the Great Central Railway (Nottingham) in 2012. Recreation To the east of the reservoir is the mountain of Garn Ddu, and to the west is the mountain of Cadair Fawr. There are a variety of guided walks and waymarked paths. Environmental sculptures can be found on the Wern and Willow walks. The Taff Trail path links Cefn-coed-y-cymmer to Brecon. There is one bird hide. In 2020, Welsh Water blocked off lay-bys around the Llwyn Onn reservoir because of persistent complaints about them being used for antisocial behaviour such as dogging.

J. \\"Bill\\" Simpson (March 14, 1940 – December 16, 2019) was an American racecar driver, but is best known as a pioneer in the racing safety business with his company Simpson Performance Products. He left Simpson Performance in a controversy surrounding Dale Earnhardt's death and started Impact! Racing. He was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2003.Bill Simpson at the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America Racing career Simpson started in drag racing and SCCA Formula racing, eventually moving up to the USAC Championship Car series. He raced in the 1968-1974 and 1976-1977 seasons, with 52 career starts. He qualified twentieth for the 1974 Indianapolis 500, and finished thirteenth. He finished in the top ten 11 times, with his best finish in 6th position in 1970 at Milwaukee. He decided to end his racing career in 1977, because he started to think about a telephone call that he needed to make while he was practicing at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Race safety advocate In 1958, the 18-year- old Simpson broke both arms in a drag racing crash. Simpson later said, \\"Until then, I was like most drivers. The only time I thought about safety was after I'd been hurt. This time, I was hurt bad enough to do a lot of thinking.\\" Simpson's uncle owned a military surplus store, and suggested that he use a cross-form parachute to slow down the drag car. Simpson rented a sewing machine to create a prototype. Simpson got together with his friend dragster driver Mike Sorokin to test the prototype. They tested it by attaching it to a tow hitch, and dumping it from the back of the Chevy wagon while Sorokin drove down a street at 100 mph. The chute was too big for the car, and the car went airborne and crashed into a tree nursery. Both racers were jailed for the incident, but Simpson Drag Chutes was founded. Jim Donnelly, Muscle Machines 1203 Hot Rod Hero: Bill Simpson The first person to inquire about and use his parachute was \\"Big Daddy\\" Don Garlits. Lori Lovely, \\"Nuvo Safety Spelled S-i- m-p-s-o-n\\" He evolved his business into a number of other safety items, such as gloves, helmets, restraints and shoes. Simpson designed NASA's first umbilical cords, where he met Pete Conrad. Conrad introduced Simpson to DuPont product Nomex in 1967. Simpson used the product to create the first fire suit to be used in racing. He took the suit to the 1967 Indianapolis 500 where it was worn by 30 of 33 drivers. Simpson had developed over 200 racing safety products, including three generations of fire suits. Simpson has at several times demonstrated the suit's effectiveness, by being set on fire while wearing a suit. Earnhardt controversy Simpson Performance Products was involved in a controversy after the February 2001 death of Dale Earnhardt over whether the seat belt manufactured by the company had malfunctioned. NASCAR's investigation into the crash in part blamed seat belt failure. Simpson received death threats and bullets into his house, which led to his resignation in July 2001. Simpson sued NASCAR for $8.5 million defamation of character suit in February 2003. Simpson withdrew his lawsuit with an undisclosed settlement. After leaving Simpson Performance Products, Bill Simpson realized that he still had much to contribute to improving driver safety. After a one-year non-compete with Simpson Performance Products expired, he started Impact! Racing in 2002. In addition to the drag chutes and Nomex underwear that Bill Simpson first introduced to racing, Impact! also manufactures restraints, helmets, race suits, shoes, and gloves for drag racing, NASCAR, Indycar, and other racing applications. In 2010, Bill Simpson sold Impact! Racing to Robbie Pierce and MasterCraft Safety. Football helmets Simpson designed a lighter football helmet after attending an Indianapolis Colts football game and witnessing a player being hit in the head by the ball. He partnered with Chip Ganassi to form Simpson Ganassi Helmets. They sold the company in 2018.New local owners of SG Helmets hope to protect next generation of football players - Karen Billing, Rancho Santa Fe Review, 4 September 2018 Career award In 2003, he was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in the \\"at large\\" category.

They are found across Australia and New Zealand, with some species occupying the Auckland Islands and one found exclusively on Snares Island. There are eight species currently described within the genus, the earliest noted being the type species Clynotis severus, first described in Queensland, New South Wales, Australia in 1879 by Ludwig Carl Christian Koch. The most recent was described in 1931 by Lucien Berland. Two other species previously held within the genus were subsequently reclassified into the genus Tara. As with most salticidae spiders, members of this genus are known for their ability to jump with agility, and for their strong vision. They are identifiable from the distinct shape of the cephalothorax and their eye patterns. Of their eight eyes, the front row of four feature a dramatically prominent anterior median pair, while the rear row of four eyes may be described as strongly bent, or as being rearranged into two rows, with two large posterior lateral eyes furthest back. These supply lateral vision, while the forward four are adapted to detailed, three- dimensional vision for purposes of estimating the range, direction, and nature of potential prey, permitting the spider to direct its attacking leaps with great precision.Crompton, J. (1954). The Life of the Spider. Mentor, p. 77. Also in common with other salticidae, they use their silk for safety lines while jumping. They construct silken \\"pup tents\\", where they shelter from bad weather and sleep at night. They molt within these shelters, build and store egg cases within them, and also spend the winter in them.

The genus was erected by Hippolyte Lucas in 1846. Description Cyrba spiders are small to medium size spiders that are usually brightly colored. Their cephalothorax is long and moderately high. The eyes are lateral. The abdomen is long with bright colorful patterns. Their legs are thin and slender. The genus has been described as primitive because of their pervasive use of webs, large posterior median eyes, and the secretory organs on the femora of males. These characteristics were lost by advanced salticids. The genus are also almost wholly dependent on their vision. The primary mating season for the spider C. algerina is May. Juveniles emerge in July, grow to about half the adult size by winter, and then grow to adult size in the spring of the following year. The genus is commonly found on very rocky ground under rocks, or less often walking around on the ground or on the tops of rocks.Robert R. Jackson: \\"Predatory versatility and intraspecific interactions of Cyrba algerina and Cyrba ocellata, web-invading spartaeine jumping spiders (Araneae: Salticidae)\\" in: New Zealand Journal of Zoology, 1990, Vol. 17, pp. 157-168 Silk and eggs The spider spins silk on which to moult. Cyrba makes an egg sac by spinning a thick silk sheet on the side of a rock, and then ovipositing the eggs in the center, covering them with another layer of silk. The egg sacs have clusters of white spots. Cyrba spiders generally stay with their eggs until they hatch. In a laboratory, they do not spin silk for moulting or resting. Diet Spiders in this genus feed on other spiders, and prefer them to insects. They also feed on any insect that is caught in their silk. In a laboratory test to see if Cyrba spiders would attack other salticids, they did not. The spider C. algerina is the only spider in the genus that is known to hunt at night.

Its only species, Necatia magnidens, is found in southern China. The species is only known from a single female specimen, collected in 1872 by A. David, and described by Schenkel almost a hundred years later. Nothing more has been reported of the species since. Description From above, the carapace is U-shaped, slightly flared at the front. The female is slightly larger than 6 mm. The posterior lateral eyes are located almost halfway along the carapace. The abdomen is longer than broad and the legs are spiny. Schenkel described the specimen as having an overall brownish black color, \\"which is, perhaps, not surprising for a specimen preserved for so long\\". Name The genus name is dedicated to Necati Bingöl. magnidens is Latin for \\"big toothed\\". Taxonomy Taxonomically, this genus is interesting. The name Davidina was proposed by Brignoli in 1985 as a replacement for the original name Davidia, proposed by Schenkel in 1963. This was necessary according to ICZN rules, because Davidia had already been established by Hicks in 1873 as the name of a genus of Cycloconchidae, fossil mollusks. However, Brignoli overlooked that in 1879, Oberthür had already named a genus of Satyrini thus. Possibly, Brignioli believed the mollusk genus to be a nomen dubium; it is certainly weakly defined (Carter 1971 fide Sánchez 1999) but it is still generally accepted as valid. In any case, the lepidopteran genus is well-defined and valid. Thus, another replacement name for the spider became necessary. References *Brignoli, Paolo Marcello (1985).

Biography Withycombe was born to tenant farmers Thomas and Mary Ann Withycombe in Tavistock, England in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1854. Withycombe immigrated to the United States with his parents in 1871, settling on a farm near Hillsboro, Oregon. He worked on his father's farm for four years, and in 1873 Withycombe purchased his own parcel on the Horace Lindsay Land Claim, later expanding his holdings to . Agriculture became Withycombe's passion, becoming a prosperous livestock breeder and establishing a reputation as a successful scientific farmer. On June 6, 1875 in Washington County he married Isabell Carpenter, and the couple would have a daughter and three sons together.County governors both die in office. Hillsboro Argus, October 19, 1976. Farmer and educator His success led to his involvement in local farming organizations. He became a charter member of the Farmington Grange, and later became a leader in the state grange movement. From these platforms, Withycombe's efficient, innovative, and profitable farming methods became a model for farmers across the Pacific Northwest. His stature gained him an appointment as State Veterinarian in 1889, where he would diligently work to improve conditions of livestock health around the state. Withycombe in front of the OSU Ag Building Although mostly self-educated, he was sought after by the Oregon Agricultural College at Corvallis (now Oregon State University) in 1898 to be the head of the college's experimental farming station. He received his Master's Degree in Agriculture 1891 from OAC. Using this position to advance Oregon agriculture, he would play a major part in introducing alfalfa and clover to Eastern Oregon, laying the groundwork for the region's future agricultural economy. Withycombe also became heavily involved in Oregon's agricultural industry, serving as president of the North Pacific Wool Growers and Northwest Sheep Breeders Associations. His tenureship on the board of the Oregon Academy of Sciences saw the dairy industry's profits rise from $2.5 million to $20 million. Such accomplishments built up respect for Withycombe statewide and gained the state Republican Party's attention. Governorship Withycombe would enter politics in the 1906 Oregon gubernatorial election. He won the Republican nomination in the primary but lost in the general election to incumbent Democratic Governor George Earle Chamberlain.https://www.newspapers.com/image/96019043/?terms=BOURNE+CAKE The 1910 election of controversial Democratic Governor Oswald West energized Oregon Republicans, who tapped Withycombe for the 1914 gubernatorial race. He handily defeated challenger Charles Smith; the first Republican Governor to assume office via election since T. T. Geer in 1903. As Governor, James Withycombe vigorously promoted agricultural development. A notable proposal from his administration was to ask the Legislative Assembly to subsidize flax production as a prison industry. The Withycombe Administration backed the \\"Good Roads\\" movement, creating the Oregon Highway Commission while in office. With the new commission in place, a large road-building program was initiated, establishing many of Oregon's modern state routes and highways. Upon the U.S. entry into the First World War, Governor Withycombe took a vocal and patriotic position in support of the war effort. He encouraged volunteer military service, and promoted the state's war industries. Withycombe's crypt in Salem While in office, he took a strong position against labor unions. He spoke out publicly against the Industrial Workers of the World, claiming that it terrorized labor and would cripple industry following several instances of IWW threats to disrupt production in 1917. He organized veterans of the Spanish–American War into an Oregon State Defense force, and encouraged citizens in Eastern Oregon to form self-defence committees to defend the state against violent labor agitators. Withycombe used his powers as Governor to prevent a shipyard strike in Astoria, by calling out the National Guard. His 1918 reelection campaign capitalized on his wartime acts, portraying him as a wartime Governor actively protecting the state and aiding the defense of the United States. These efforts gained him a second term, of which he only served two months. Death and legacy Withycombe died in office of a heart condition on March 3, 1919, succeeded by Secretary of State Ben W. Olcott. He was interred in Mount Crest Abbey Mausoleum in City View Cemetery in Salem, Oregon. Withycombe Hall at Oregon State University is named after the him, as he was the head of the agricultural research station at OSU's predecessor (Oregon Agricultural College). The building is home to the Department of Animal and Rangeland Sciences, plus it contains an auditorium used by the Theater Department. Camp Withycombe, a military facility in Clackamas, was named for him.

The state park's include Lake Habeeb, Evitts Mountain, and the privately owned and operated Rocky Gap Casino Resort. The park offers water recreation, camping facilities, and hiking trails. The park is managed by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, the resort by Golden Entertainment, Inc. History The park originated with the donation of land by Edward Habeeb and others for the creation of a state park at Rocky Gap. Initial state purchases began in 1963 with land acquisition continuing until 1966. In 1970, the Army Corps of Engineers dammed Rocky Gap Run to create Lake Habeeb. The park opened in 1974. ;Resort The Rocky Gap Resort and Golf Course was developed in 1998 by the Maryland Economic Development Corporation (MEDCO), an agency created in 1984 that allows the State of Maryland to directly own or develop property for economic benefit. The facility opened in April 1998 at a cost of $53.9 million. The resort failed to sustain its early success, began posting losses, and became dependent on MEDCO subsidies to stay in operation. ;Casino In 2009, the state's initial effort to open a casino in the park failed when the only bidder, Empire Resorts, did not pay the required $4.5 million licensing fee. Empire's contingent bid was based on Maryland altering its 67 percent tax on casinos—one of the highest in the United States. In 2011, legislators lowered the state’s share of slots revenue at Rocky Gap from 67 percent to 50 percent. A casino license was awarded in April 2012 to a subsidiary of Lakes Entertainment of Minnetonka, Minnesota, who completed purchase of the existing resort, including the 200-room lakeside lodge, the Jack Nicklaus-designed 18-hole golf course, and other features, from the state in August 2012. The sale price was reported at less than $7 million. The renamed Rocky Gap Casino Resort opened on May 22, 2013, with 558 slot machines and 10 live table games. In 2015, Rocky Gap Casino-Resort was acquired by Golden Entertainment when the company merged with Lakes Entertainment. The casino operates 665 gaming devices and 17 table games. The hotel has 198 rooms and suites. Activities and amenities ;Lake Habeeb The park's man-made Lake Habeeb covers and sports white sand beaches. It sits below Evitts Mountain and is fed by Rocky Gap Run. Boats (electric motors only) are allowed on Lake Habeeb 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and a fee is assessed. The park offers paddle boats, kayaks, and canoes for rent. Fish most commonly caught by anglers at Lake Habeeb include largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, black crappie, rainbow trout, brown trout, channel catfish, bluegill, redear sunfish, and pumpkinseed. ;Trails Hiking trails include the four-mile (6 km) Lakeside Trail and the five-mile (8 km) Evitt's Homesite Trail, which climbs Evitts Mountain amid streams with hemlock, mountain laurel and rhododendron growing nearby. The quarter-mile Touch of Nature Trail is a paved route to an accessible fishing dock. ;Amphitheater The park's amphitheater and concert stage can be rented. Its seating capacity is 3,000, and the stage area is by . The stage was built as a permanent home for the Rocky Gap Country Bluegrass Festival (1988-2001) but was never used for those shows.

It was formed by a group of nine small andesitic stratovolcanoes and basaltic andesite vents in the scenic Garibaldi Lake area immediately north of Mount Garibaldi was formed during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. The oldest stratovolcano, The Black Tusk, formed between about 1.3 and 1.1 million years ago (Ma). Following glacial dissection, renewed volcanism produced the lava dome and flow forming its summit. Other Pleistocene vents are located along and to the west of the Cheakamus River. Cinder Cone, to the east of The Black Tusk, produced a 9-km-long lava flow during the late Pleistocene or early Holocene. The Black Tusk viewed from the southeast Mount Price, west of Garibaldi Lake, 5 km south of The Black Tusk, was formed in three stages of activity, dating back 1.1 million years, the latest of which produced two large lava flows from Clinker Peak during the early Holocene that ponded against the retreating continental ice sheet and formed The Barrier, containing Garibaldi Lake. The Table is a steep-sided andesite tuya, situated approximately 3 km southwest of Mount Price and south of Garibaldi Lake. It rises 305 meters above glaciated basement rocks. The tuya formed by effusion of flatlying flows within erratics on its summit and lack of erosional features attributable to glacial suggest that The Table was also formed during the early Holocene. Clinker Peak is a stratovolcano on the west shoulder of Mount Price on the west side of Garibaldi Lake. It has produced two large lava flows about 9,000 years ago. Mount Brew is a subglacial mound, which last erupted during the Pleistocene. Hazards The Rock fall area and the edge of The Barrier Future eruptions within the region could endanger the municipalities of Whistler and Squamish. Even though no Plinian eruptions are recognized, even Peléan eruptions may possibly create large amounts of volcanic ash that will possibly affect these close by villages. Ash columns from the volcanoes might rise hundreds of metres and could make this a serious hazard for air traffic. The unstable lava formation of The Barrier has in the past unleashed several debris flows in the area below the lake, most recently in 1855-56 forming a large boulder field which gives Rubble Creek its name. Concerns about the Barrier's instability due to volcanic, tectonic, or heavy rainfall activity prompted the provincial government to declare the area immediately below it unsafe for human habitation in 1981. This led to the evacuation of the nearby village of Garibaldi, and the relocation of residents to new recreational subdivisions away from the hazard zone. Should the Barrier completely collapse, Garibaldi Lake would be entirely released and downstream damage in the Cheakamus and Squamish Rivers would be considerable, including major damage to the town of Squamish and possibly an impact wave on the waters of Howe Sound that would reach Vancouver Island.

It is the only species in the genus Hakka. H. himeshimensis is native to East Asia, but has been introduced to the United States. It is most commonly found in rocky coastal habitats.Kaldari et al. 2011 Description Palpal organ of male Hakka himeshimensis Both sexes have a body length of about 7 mm. The body and legs are uniformly dark brown. The body is covered with sparse lighter hairs. Between the eyes there are longer, reddish hairs that stand up diagonally. The chelicerae are brown and robust.Berry & Proszynski 2001 Distribution Hakka himeshimensis occurs in China, North Korea, Japan, Hawaii, and the Eastern United States. It is not clear if there is a viable population in Hawaii, or if the found specimens represent incidental recent arrivals (although three specimens were collected over a period of 74 years). It is likely that the species was accidentally introduced to the Eastern United States by maritime shipping. Name The genus name is derived from Hakka, a Chinese people with 70 million worldwide. Many members were brought to Hawaii as laborers on sugar cane plantations in the middle of the 19th century. This is probably a reference to the species' origin in Asia.

Biography He was born into the prominent Benja-Kožičić family. His mother was Venetian from the Contarini household. While his parents wanted him to become a soldier he decided to enter the priesthood. After his education in Zadar and Rome, he became a canon and the prefect of the Church of St. John near the port in Zadar. Pope Julius II named him bishop of Modruš in 1509 in a time of uncertainty in Croatia after the Croatian loss to the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Krbava Field of 1493. Coat of Arms of Šimun Kožičić Benja, printed on his books. Kožičić wrote the well-known work Psaltir which was a small prayerbook which contained some basic Christian prayers, as well as some psalms and other songs for prayer and for use in mass. These kinds of booklets were the basics which aspiring priests and other believers used to learn to read. On the first page of Kožičić's Psaltir, at the very top, was written a primer which contained all the Croatian letters written in Glagolitic script. After this came the Our Father, Hail Mary and the start of the Apostles Creed. At the Fifth Lateran Council in Rome in 1513, Šimun Kožičić Benja lectured on the hardships of his homeland in a speech called De Croat[i]ae desolatione (Desolated Croatia) and sought help. After the Turks attacked Modruš, Benja travelled to Rijeka in 1530 and founded his Glagolitic printing press. By 1531 he printed five more books in Glagolitic: Oficij rimski (a prayer book), Knjižice krsta (a book of rites), Misal hruacki (a missal), Knjižice od žitija rimskih arhijerov i cesarov (a historic work about the Roman popes and emperors) and Od bitja redovničkog knjižice (a handbook about the proper conduct of clerics). In 1532 he returned to Zadar where he died in March 1536. He was laid to rest in the Franciscan monastery of St. Jerome in Ugljan, where his brother Ivan Donat put up a grave marker. A retrospective portrait of Bishop Šimun Kožičić Benja is located in the National Museum in Zadar.

The genera Habronattus and Pellenes are closely related. All then known species were split from the genus Sandalodes. All twelve species occur on the islands of the Hawaiian and Marquesas chains. Recent molecular studies suggest that the species from the two chains are the result of independent colonizations (Arnedo & Gillespie, 2006). The Marquesas species H. triangulifera and H. flavipes are not included in Havaika by Prószyński, 2008. Collecting travels in the late 1990 have suggested that the salticid fauna of Hawaii has been drastically exterminated, so it may be that several or most of the described species are in fact already extinct. Description Spiders in this genus follow the generalized salticid body plan, but differ from other genera by the appearance of the epigyne. The cephalothorax is dark with variable whitish setae ornamentation on the face and some white and yellow scales on the frontal surface of chelicerae and the rim of the eyes. The body length varies from less than two up to ten mm.Proszinski 2008 Relationship with other genera Although placed in subfamily Pelleninae, tribus Pellenini at a time, Prószyński, 2008 abstains from formal subfamilial placement of the genus. The Havaika epigynes resemble those of the genera Bianor, Modunda and Habronattus, but differ from them by the structure of spermathecae and other internal structures. Male palps of Havaika seem to be more specialized. Evolution on Hawaii The ancestors of modern Havaika species probably reached the Hawaiian islands after most of the recent islands were already formed (about two million years ago), and after many other spiders had already colonized the islands. The speciation does not follow the progression rule typically found in radiated species of Hawaii, where islands were colonized as they formed, creating new species on the way. Today, Havaika represents about four thirds of all salticid species on Hawaii. Four lineages can be discerned, using genetic analysis (Arnedo & Gillespie, 2006). Prószyński, 2008 regards the biogeography of lineages by Arnedo & Gillespie, 2006 as meaningless. left * Specimens from the pubens clade bear yellowish scales on the chelicerae in both sexes, and long palpal tibia in males. Their carapace is dark brown, with two lighter longitudinal dorsal bands. They occur on Maui, Moloka'i and Lana'i (which were once a single island), Kaua'i, O'ahu and Big Island. * The verecunda clade shows sexual dimorphism: males bear rows of long white bristles on the chelicerae and have short palpal tibia, while females have few bristles, but dense white hairs on the clypeus. The black carapace sometimes sports a brush of white hairs on the mid-frontal part, with two longitudinal whitish spots. They occur on Moloka'i and Maui, which were a single island until about half a million years ago, Kaua'i and O'ahu. * \\"Morphotype D\\" is almost uniformly dark brown with grayish longitudinal abdominal patterns. It shows sparse white scales restricted to the lower margin of the clypeus. It is found on Lana'i. * H. cruciata shows the same facial characteristics as the verecunda clade, but can be distinguished by bulb characters. Males have a slender, long embolus originating from the basal half of the tegulum, similar to the embolus of the pubens clade, but a short palpal tibia. They have the same black carapace as the verecunda clade. H. cruciata is only found on Big Island. It is probably the sister taxon of Morphotype D. * Specimens from Necker Island and Nihoa (northwest of Kaua'i) did not fit into the four defined morphotypes. However, it is currently not feasible to group the poorly defined species into these lineages. In all cases where two species were found on the same island, they significantly differed in size. This makes it likely that the two species hunt for different prey, and thus do not compete with each other. However, it seems that Havaika size differentiation happened soon after arrival on the Hawaiian islands, with subsequent dispersal and further speciation. This is suggested by the observation that the bigger of two sympatric species always belongs to one evolutionary lineage (pubens clade), while the smaller belongs to the other (Arnedo & Gillespie, 2006).

After the Army abandoned its search for a new pistol, the Model 39 went on the civilian market in 1955 and was the first of Smith & Wesson's first generation semi-automatic pistols. A modified version saw limited use with Naval Special Warfare units as the Mk 22 Mod 0. Overview The Smith & Wesson Model 39 was the first U.S. designed double action (DA) semi-automatic pistol marketed in the United States. The German Walther P38 DA pistol impressed American ordnance personnel during World War II. The Army Ordnance Corps issued a proposal for an American equivalent to the P38. In 1949, Smith & Wesson began development of the Model 39 chambered in 9×19mm Luger and it entered the market in 1955. This is considered a first generation pistol. Since the Model 39 came out, S&W; has continuously developed the design into its third generation pistols now on the market. First generation models use a 2 digit model number, second generation use 3 digits, and third generation models use 4 digits. Details of the controls. The Model 39 was originally manufactured with an anodized aluminum frame, a curved backstrap and a blued carbon steel slide that carried the manual safety. The grip was of three pieces made of two walnut wood panels joined by a metal backstrap. It has a magazine release located at the rear of the trigger guard, similar to the M1911A1 it was designed to replace. It was also produced in single-action configuration, as the Model 44. The Model 39 was produced in limited numbers with a steel frame. This steel-frame model provided the basis for the Model 52 target pistol. The Model 52 had a longer (5 inch) barrel and slide and was one of the few semi-automatic pistols ever chambered for the .38 Special cartridge (with flush-seated, full wadcutter bullets only). The shape of the rimmed cartridge limited the magazine capacity to five rounds. A further variant, the Model 952, in 9mm Luger, is still produced in limited quantities by Smith & Wesson's Performance Center. The Model 52 was discontinued in 1992 when the machinery to manufacture the pistol broke down and it was deemed too costly to replace. The Model 39 was the basis for the later Smith & Wesson Model 59, retaining the original 9mm Parabellum caliber, but incorporating a wider aluminum frame with a straight backstrap to accommodate a double-column magazine that could hold 14 rounds. The Model 39 used a conventional slide, barrel bushing, slide arrangement as opposed to the exposed barrel arrangement of the P38. Model 39 locking is done by a modification of the Browning P35 (High Power) cam-locked breech. First generation Model 39 slides used either a long, spring steel extractor or a spring-loaded, pivoting claw extractor. Long extractors tended to be fragile and were replaced by the pivoting type. However, the long extractor proved to be more reliable than the pivoting version. The Model 39 employed many features common to the Walther P38 such as a decocking safety that disconnected the trigger and hammer. Smith & Wesson even copied the 8-round single-stack magazine as well but added a magazine catch cutout to it. The overall length of the Model 39 was 7.6 inches, the barrel is 4 inches long. The weight of the Model 39 was 1.72 pounds; this light weight is due to its aluminum frame. The Illinois State Police adopted the Model 39 in 1968, an action which helped ingratiate semi-automatic pistols with law enforcement. This publicity helped commercial sales and set the stage for the more acceptable Model 59 with its high capacity magazine at least in undercover or detective police use where the DA feature (and the larger magazine capacity) was considered by many to be superior to single-stack semi-automatics and revolvers of the time. A modified version of the Model 39 with a wider grip frame to accommodate a 14-round magazine was used by Naval Special Warfare units during the Vietnam War. It was issued to officers-in-charge (OICs) of MST-2 detachments as their sidearm. SEAL Teams used either the Model 39 without modification or a modified version, the Mk 22 Mod 0, which was called the \\"hush puppy\\". The modified pistol had a suppressor with a slide lock (preventing the slide from moving backwards upon firing, thereby decreasing produced noise). The Mk 22 Mod 0 had raised iron sights, to provide easier sighting over a bulky suppressor. The gun's purpose was to eliminate sentry dogs or guards without alarming the main target.

The word \\"static\\" refers only to the fact that static meshes can't be vertex animated, as they can be moved, scaled, or reskinned in realtime. Static Meshes can create more complex shapes than CSG (the other major part of map architecture) and are faster to render per triangle. Characteristics A Static Mesh contains information about its shape (vertices, edges and sides), a reference to the textures to be used, and optionally a collision model (see the simple collision section below). Collision There are three ways for a Static Mesh to collide: *No collision: a static mesh can be set not to block anything. This is often used for small decoration like grass. *Per-polygon collision (default): individual polygons collide with actors. Each material (i.e. each part of the Static Mesh using a separate texture) can be set to collide or not independently from the rest. The advantage of this method is that one part of the Static Mesh can collide while another doesn't (a common example: a tree's trunk collides, but its leaves don't). The disadvantage is that for complex meshes this can take a lot of processing power. *Simple collision: the static mesh doesn't collide itself, but has built-in blocking volumes that collide instead. Usually, the blocking volumes will have a simpler shape than the Static Mesh, resulting in faster collision calculation. Texturing Although Static Meshes have built-in information on what textures to use, this can be overridden by adding a new skin in the Static Mesh's properties. Alternatively, the Static Mesh itself can be modified to use different textures by default. Usage In maps, Static Meshes are very common, as they are used for anything more complex than basic architecture (in which case CSG is used) or terrain. Additionally, Static Meshes sometimes represent other objects, including weapon projectiles and destroyed vehicles. Often after rendered cutscenes in which, for instance, a tank is destroyed, the tank's hull would be added as a static mesh to the real-game world.

The film is based on an actual event – the hijacking of a flight by terrorists and the freeing of Israeli hostages on July 4, 1976. The operation was known as (Operation Entebbe, military code name: \\"Operation Thunderbolt\\") at Entebbe Airport in Uganda. Operation Thunderbolt follows the events following the flight's takeoff until the hostages' return to Israel. Plot On June 27, 1976, four terrorists belonging to a splinter group of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine under the orders of Wadie Haddad boarded and hijacked Flight 139, an Air France Airbus A300 in Athens, Greece. Two of the terrorists are West Germans named Wilfried Boese and Halima, and the other two are Palestinians. After landing to refuel in Libya, the four hijackers force the airliner to take off once again. With President Idi Amin's permission, the terrorists divert the airliner and its hostages to Entebbe Airport in Uganda. The hijackers are joined at Entebbe by more Palestinian militants. After identifying Israeli passengers, the non-Jewish passengers are freed while a series of demands are made, including the release of 40 Palestinian militants held in Israel, in exchange for the hostages. The Cabinet of Israel, unwilling to give in to terrorist demands, is faced with difficult decisions as their deliberations lead to a top-secret military raid. This commando operation, \\"Operation Thunderbolt\\", will be carried out over from home and will take place on the Jewish Sabbath. While still negotiating with the terrorists, who now numbered seven individuals, the Israeli military prepared a group of Lockheed C-130 Hercules transports for the raid. The transports landed at Entebbe Airport under the cover of darkness. The commandos led by Brigadier General Dan Shomron had to contend with a large armed Ugandan military detachment and used a ruse to overcome the defenses. A black Mercedes limousine had been carried on board and was used to fool sentries that it was the official car that President Amin used on an impromptu visit to the airport. Nearly complete surprise was achieved but a firefight resulted, ending with all seven terrorists and 45 Ugandan soldiers killed. The hostages were gathered together and most were quickly put on the idling C-130 aircraft. During the raid, one commando (the breach unit commander Yonatan Netanyahu, brother of future Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu), and three of the hostages, died. With 102 hostages aboard and on their way to freedom, a group of Israeli commandos remained behind to destroy the Ugandan Air Force MiG-17 and MiG-21 fighters to prevent a retaliation. All the survivors of the attack force then joined in flying to Nairobi for refueling and then back to Israel via Sharm El Sheikh. Cast * Yehoram Gaon as Col.

With a projected large budget, and efforts to land Steve McQueen in a leading role, the project collapsed. At that point, Menahem Golan as director and co-producer, Yoram Globus also as co-producer and Ken Globus as screenwriter, took over the aborted project.Barron 2016, pp. 219–220. The Golan/Globus team made a decision to achieve a near-documentary feel to the proposed film. Utilizing a full-scale outdoor set consisting of control tower and terminal, the recreated Entebbe Airport also had a collection of realistic scale models of the Ugandan Air Force MiG-17 and MiG-21 fighters. Three of the four Hercules transports that were flown in the raid are seen in the film.Barron 2016, p. 220. Operation Thunderbolt was produced with the co-operation of the Israeli Air Force and the Israeli government. The film features original footage of prominent politicians such as Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Yigal Allon, although scenes with Peres being briefed by Yonatan Netanyahu's team and a hostage's father talking to Rabin feature a stand-in whose face is not seen. The exterior scenes set in Uganda were photographed near Eilat, Israel. Nearly all of the extras portraying Ugandan soldiers were played by Ethiopian Jewish immigrants. The scenes featuring the Knesset were filmed in Jerusalem, and the Tel Aviv airport sequences were filmed at Ben Gurion International Airport.Barron 2016, pp. 220–221. Originally filmed with all characters speaking in Hebrew, French, German, Arabic, or English per role, Operation Thunderbolt was shot a second time concurrently in an all-English version for the international market.

He was confirmed by the Seimas on 4 July 2006 after Zigmantas Balčytis, the provisional Prime Minister, failed to gather the required support from the parliament. He stepped down on 27 November 2008 after the 2008 parliamentary elections, and gave way to Andrius Kubilius to start his term as the prime minister. Life and career Kirkilas was born in Vilnius in 1951. After returning from mandatory military service, from 1972 to 1978 he worked on several cultural monuments (e.g. churches or the Verkiai Palace) restoring their interior and especially rolled gold and molding. In 1978–1982 he studied political science. After graduation, he joined the Communist Party of Lithuania and took various posts there. When Algirdas Brazauskas was appointed the secretary of the party, Kirkilas became his press secretary. Since independence was declared on 11 March 1990, Kirkilas was involved in the state matters and was elected to the Seimas seven times, representing the Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (in 1992, 1996 and 2000) and the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania (in 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016). He was appointed the Minister of National Defence of Lithuania on 7 December 2004. In 2004, he received an MBA from the International Business School in Vilnius. In January 2007 he was praised in The Economist as an unsung hero whose \\"minority administration has surpassed all expectations\\".  Criticism and public perception  Gediminas Kirkilas and Robert M. Gates, 1 July 2008. In July 2007, Kirkilas signed the protocol assigning the members of newly formed governmental work group to assist the energy company „Lietuvos energija“ in negotiating and consulting with potential foreign partners for a new Ignalina nuclear power plant project. A public turmoil followed after the name of occurred in the list of the work group. After the so-called State Security Departament scandal in 2006, when a senior officer Vytautas Pociūnas died under controversial circumstances in a hotel in Belarus, the witnesses described Darius Jurgelevičius as a middleman transmitting then Lithuanian Foreign Ministry's clerk Albinas Januška's influence to State Security Departament. Albinas Januška currently works as G. Kirkilas's advisor. In July 2007, before handing his powers to his successors, the chairman of the State Price and Energy Control Commission spoke about the ties between gas companies and the Prime Minister Kirkilas, saying: \\"a gas company „Lietuvos dujos“ is privately lobbying G. Kirkilas and the second Lithuanian monopolist gas company – Ministry of Economics. CEO of Lietuvos dujos, Viktoras Valentukevičius, meets Kirkilas privately to play tennis\\". In October 2014, Fair Observer featured an interview with Kirkilas where he spoke on his pro- nuclear energy stance.

Dutch Baroque architecture is a variety of Baroque architecture that flourished in the Dutch Republic and its colonies during the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century. (Dutch painting during the period is covered by Dutch Golden Age painting). Like contemporary developments in England, Dutch Palladianism is marked by sobriety and restraint. The architecture of the first republic in Northern Europe was meant to reflect democratic values by quoting extensively from classical antiquity. It found its impetus in the designs of Hendrick de Keyser, who was instrumental in establishing a Venetian-influenced style into early 17th- century architecture through new buildings like the Noorderkerk (\\"Northern church\\", 1620–1623) and Westerkerk (\\"Western church\\", 1620–1631) in Amsterdam. In general, architecture in the Low Countries, both in the Counter- Reformation-influenced south and Protestant-dominated north, remained strongly invested in northern Italian Renaissance and Mannerist forms that predated the Roman High Baroque style of Borromini and Bernini. Instead, the more austere form practiced in the Dutch Republic was well suited to major building patterns: palaces for the House of Orange and new civic buildings, uninfluenced by the Counter-Reformation style that made some headway in Antwerp. The major exponents of the mid-17th century, Jacob van Campen and Pieter Post, adopted de Keyser's forms for such eclectic elements as Giant order pilasters, gable roofs, central pediments, and vigorous steeples. Brought together in a coherent combination, these stylistic developments anticipated Christopher Wren's Classicism. The most ambitious constructions of the period included the seats of self-government in Amsterdam (1646) and Maastricht (1658), designed by Campen and Post, respectively. On the other hand, the residences of the House of Orange are closer to a typical burgher mansion than to a royal palace. Two of these, Huis ten Bosch and Mauritshuis, are symmetrical blocks with large windows, stripped of ostentatious Baroque flourishes. The same austerely geometrical effect is achieved without great cost or pretentious effects at the stadholder's summer residence of Het Loo. The Dutch Republic was one of the great powers of 17th-century Europe and its influence on European architecture was by no means negligible. Dutch architects were employed on important projects in Northern Germany, Scandinavia and Russia, disseminating their ideas in those countries. The Dutch Colonial architecture, once flourishing in the Hudson River Valley and associated primarily with red-brick gabled houses, may still be seen in Willemstad, Curaçao, although painted with more varied colors.

The genus is widespread in North America and northern South America but the center of biodiversity seems to be primarily in the Caribbean and surrounding areas, with the greatest species diversity occurring in Cuba, which has seven species. Some outlier species, such as Hentzia poenitens and Hentzia fimbriata are found in western North America. It appears to be closely related to the genus Anicius from which it differs primarily in certain anatomical details. Description The genus is characterized by the females especially having hair (setal) pencils below the posterior medial eyes and spatulate hairs on the ventral margin of the first patella and distal femur. These characters are not found in Anicius and there are some differences in the structure of both male palpi and female epigyna. However, the anatomy is close enough that there is almost certainly some relationship to Anicius. Behavior Hentzia males perform fairly elaborate courtship displays and engage in both ritual agonistic displays and fighting . Displays have been observed in Hentzia palmarum, Hentzia mitrata , Hentzia antillana, and Hentzia grenada and are suspected in the rest. In the species that have been observed, courtship begins with the male spreading his front legs and with the abdomen cocked to right or left and raised at an angle of about 30 degrees above the substrate. Males of H. palmarum started courtship from a distance of about 3-4 cm if the female moved even slightly. Some males were observed to switch the abdomen from right to left or left to right during courtship, but most kept the orientation with which they started the display. Most males moved toward the female in a zigzag path (with a sideways motion as much as 1 cm), with pauses during which the abdomen was straightened and then re-twisted. However some males proceeded in a straight path. When the male reached about 1 cm from the female he straightened his abdomen and stretched his front legs forward, eventually touching the female, raising and lowering his legs two or three times. If she was receptive the male then see-sawed his front legs over her several times and then mounted and twisted her abdomen before inserting one palp into her epigynum, repeating with a second palp on the other side. Males would often repeat mating several times until the female started to move. Male-male agonistic display initially began like courtship, but within seconds the males would unsheathe their fangs and move toward each other with abdomens cocked and front legs spread. If the males were of similar size they would usually lock chelicerae and touch spread front legs, trying to bite. Often one would break away and retreat. On occasion one did get bitten and leave with a damaged front leg. Species As of 2020, there were 22 recognized species: * Hentzia alamosa Richman, 2010 – Texas, United States * Hentzia antillana Bryant, 1940 – West Indies * Hentzia audax Bryant, 1940 – Cuba * Hentzia calypso Richman, 1989 – Jamaica * Hentzia chekika Richman, 1989 – United States, Bahama Islands, Cuba * Hentzia cubana Richman, 1989 – Cuba * Hentzia elegans (Keyserling, 1885) – North America * Hentzia fimbriata (F.

He is the founder of A.L. Williams & Associates, known as Primerica Financial Services since 1991. He also ventured into professional sports, owning the Birmingham Barracudas of the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL) for brief periods. Early life and education Born on April 26, 1942 in Cairo, Georgia. He obtained his bachelor's degree in arts and sciences at Mississippi State University in Starkville, Mississippi and his master's degree in science from Auburn University. From his early days in high school, Art aspired to be a professional football coach. Career In 1965, Williams's father suddenly died of a heart attack. He had a whole life insurance policy that left their family underinsured. Five years later Art Williams' cousin Ted Harrison introduced him to the concept of term life insurance, a much less expensive and simpler alternative to whole life which at that time was almost never sold and rarely heard of outside the insurance industry. Williams was taken aback by the idea of not knowing that there was a choice when buying life insurance and described the whole conversation as \\"disturbing,\\" recalling his father's death and referring to the fact that people had no idea of such a product. Believing that families were paying too much for whole life policies that left them poor in the wallet and deeply underinsured, Williams joined his cousin at ITT Financial Services in 1970. In June 1973, six months before ITT went out of business, he left and went on board with Waddell & Reed, another Buy term and invest the difference (BTID) company that saw early success. Williams gained momentum at W&R; and became regional vice-president (RVP) the same year, with a sales force that covered 6 states. Despite the numerous benefits of working at W&R; in comparison to ITT, it became clear to Williams that with a corporate structure in which the executives, not the sales force, owned the company, financial decisions would always have priority over the clients and there would be limits on how much the company could grow. On February 10, 1977 Williams and 85 associates founded their own company A.L. Williams & Associates on a simple philosophy: \\"Buy Term and Invest the Difference.\\"Williams biography, accessed on July 8, 2006 He convinced many customers to switch from their conventional whole-life insurance to term policies. The company's rapid growth to become the largest seller of life insurance in the U.S. was enhanced by his emphasis on promoting his people. He was one of the first to have weekly video conferences on the company's private television broadcast system. This allowed him to personally speak to each of his 100,000 plus agents and to create a family feeling that inspired them to become Financially Independent. A.L. Williams became Primerica Financial Services. Williams made a large portion of his fortune from investments, particularly in Citigroup, in which he owned 21 million shares . Williams purchased and entirely renovated the old Edwards Inn and Spa in Highlands, North Carolina spending nearly forty million dollars. The inn went from being relatively unknown to the #4 hotel according to Tripadvisor in 2012. Sports ownership Birmingham Barracudas Williams first entered the ranks of sports ownership in 1995, when he was granted a Canadian Football League (CFL) expansion franchise for Birmingham, Alabama. He wanted a team nickname that would \\"scare the spit out of people,\\" and chose the Barracudas moniker for his franchise. Like many owners of the CFL's newer American franchises, Williams was in way over his head, being unfamiliar with Canadian football. He felt Birmingham was a logical choice to place his franchise, due to the popularity of football in the state of Alabama. The results of his venture, however, told a different story. Fan support and attendance for home games were initially strong during the summer months, but declined considerably when the NFL, NCAA, and high school football seasons started. Knowing the 'Cudas could not even begin to go head-to-head with Alabama and Auburn football, Williams persuaded the CFL to allow the Barracudas to play their September and October home games on Sundays. This was not nearly enough to prevent a steep decline at the gate. Williams estimated he spent $10 million to launch the Barracudas franchise, and lost a substantial amount throughout the course of the season.Cudas Apparently Through in Birmingham. Gadsden Times, Associated Press, November 7, 1995, accessed 29 January 2014 https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&dat;=19951107&id;=KrwfAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=FNgEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=4898,678628 Williams was outspoken in his criticism of the CFL and its style of play, and along with the other American team owners wanted changes made to several league rules. Amongst these requests were to reduce the size of a CFL field and alter gameplay to match American football standards, and to change the name of the league to better reflect the presence of American teams. He strongly petitioned the CFL to move the season to the spring months, as he was unwilling to risk another season going head-to-head with the other American football leagues, especially college football. When the league refused to comply with his requests, Williams decided to sell the Barracudas to a group of investors called Ark-La-Tex Football Association, which intended to move the team to Shreveport as a replacement for the Shreveport Pirates, which had collapsed under the mismanagement of owner Bernard Glieberman. The transaction proposal was for $750,000. Williams said it was a significant loss, based on his own estimates. The league rejected the sale and opted to contract the remaining American franchises prior to the 1996 season instead.Ralph, Dan. Speros reportedly close to pulling Stallions. Associated Press, 1996-01-26. Tampa Bay Lightning In 1998, Williams returned to sports ownership when he purchased the National Hockey League's Tampa Bay Lightning from Kokusai Green for $117 million, outbidding Detroit Pistons owner William Davidson for the franchise. Williams was visible and outspoken during the early stages of his ownership of the Lightning. He cleared the majority of the team's debt, which was $102 million at the time of the sale, and added an additional $6 million to the player payroll, allowing the team to acquire established players such as Wendel Clark, Craig Janney, and Bill Ranford. This would be a stark contrast to the penny-pinching manner of the previous ownership. The Lightning drafted Vincent Lecavalier with the first overall pick at the 1998 NHL Entry Draft, whom Williams declared to be \\"The Michael Jordan of hockey.\\" The statement drew heavy criticism in hockey circles, as it placed lofty expectations on the young forward in addition to revealing Williams' ignorance of the sport. As with his time in the CFL, Williams was seen as being in way over his head as an NHL owner. His lack of knowledge about ice hockey, combined with his thick Southern accent and fundamentalist Christian views, made him an easy target for ridicule from his NHL colleagues, who often referred him as \\"Jed Clampett\\" behind his back. This perception was reinforced by the fact that Williams did not smoke or drink alcohol and used words like \\"goldangit\\" in place of profanities. On the ice, Williams' lone season as team owner was mired in chaos. Despite publicly assuring general manager Phil Esposito and assistant general manager Tony Esposito their jobs were safe, Williams fired them two games into the 1998–99 season, giving head coach Jacques Demers exclusive control of the team's hockey operations as both coach and general manager. The team would record a ten-game losing streak early in the season, all but ending any chance of making the playoffs. The Lightning finished the season at 19–54–9. By the spring of 1999, the team's on-ice performance, along with the turmoil in the front office and long-term financial situation proved to be too much to handle. Williams hadn't attended a game since the team hosted the 1999 NHL All-Star Game in January. He would go on to explain his refusal of being as visible as he was in the early stages of his ownership was his disappointment regarding the venture. citing \\"this team broke my heart\\". Williams lost $20 million in the 1998–99 season alone, which was more in one year as he estimated he could have lost in five years. Williams eventually sold the team to Davidson, whom he outbid a year earlier for $115 million, which was $2 million less than his original purchase price.Blunderful, St. Petersburg Timeshttp://www.lcshockey.com/issues/115/tam.asp Wealth In 1998, he saved the Christian Liberty University in Virginia, donating $70 million and erasing decades of debt. He stated that \\"My wife and I always knew God wanted us to do something special with our money\\".Chicago Tribune, accessed on October 31, 2017 , he ranks number 512 on the Forbes list of the \\"World's Billionaires\\" with an estimated wealth of $1.5 billion.

In the East Midlands, the surname is certainly of patronymic origin. This is also a possibility in Cheshire yet the name there more probably originated as a locative surname. Origin in the East Midlands The surname Astle originated in Mercia, England. In the East Midlands, the name was derived from the Old Norse name Ásketill , from áss \\"god\\" and ketill \\"cauldron\\". References to a king Asketil who with three other kings in 874 sacked Repton, are found in 12th-century surveys by the Monks of Burton Abbey. This was during the campaign of King Ceolwulf II and the Great Heathen Army to overthrow King Burgred. The four kings were allocated lands in a partitioned Mercia corresponding to the modern shires of Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby and Leicester. To this day, the largest grouping of Astle families is still concentrated in a relatively small area of South Derbyshire and East Staffordshire, close to the River Trent. Origin in Cheshire While the spelling 'Astles' prevails in Cheshire, the regular spelling of 'Astle' is also common. However, its origin in this area may be distinct. As the Danes occupied Cheshire via the west coast, it is possible that other men named 'Asketil' lent their name to the people of the region. However, it is more likely that the name is this area derives from the hamlet of Astle, previously Asthull, a contraction of \\"east hill\\". Thus it is a locative surname. Alternative Spellings The following alternative spellings are related to the name 'Astle': Astel, Astell, Asthul, Astill, Astels, Astles, Astull, Astyll and Asketil. The surname Astley is 'not' related. Historical Occurrences The first recorded spelling of any variant of the family name dates to circa 1225 during the reign of King Henry III when the 'Episcopal Records of Lichfield', Staffordshire, make mention of 'Simon de Astell'. The evolution of the name can be observed in the register of the Black Prince's administration (1346–1365) where it records that: 'In 1365, one Robert Astel of Hazelbech, Northants, asked the Black Prince to confirm his rightful ownership of one of his lands in Hazelbech. He produced a document providing that the land had been given to 'William son of Asketil of Hazelbech and his heirs'.' Robert Astel was of course one of these heirs. A 'Register of the Freemen of the City of York' dating from 1349 includes 'Richard de Asthul'. Coat of arms The shield of the Astle coat of arms is gules (red) symbolising martyrdom, military strength or warriors. It contains a white cross crosslet in each corner, indicating that the family engaged in the Crusades. At its centre is a 'lion passant', the upper body of which is 'or' (gold), according to the common English tradition, while the colouring of its lower body may signify the Danish origin of the family. Crest The Astle family crest is a seahorse couchant ducally gorged. It originated in Staffordshire. The seahorse symbolises the power of water. Motto The Astle family motto is 'Sub cruce glorior' ('The glory of the Cross'). People The following famous people have the surname 'Astle': * Alec Astle (b. 1949), former New Zealand cricketer * David Astle (b. 1961), Australian writer * Jeff Astle (1942–2002), English association footballer * John Astle (b. 1943), American politician * Nathan Astle (b. 1971), New Zealand cricketer * Thomas Astle (1735–1803), English antiquarian * Todd Astle (b. 1986), New Zealand cricketer (not related to Nathan Astle) References External links * Name Distribution in England & Wales Category:English-language surnames Category:Family coats of arms Category:Patronymic surnames ","title":"Astle"},{"id":"5826202","text":"The Winnipeg International Children's Festival, also known as Kidsfest, is a children's festival held annually at The Forks National Historic Park.

The MoD designates the Wolf 90 as Truck Utility Light (TUL) HS and the Wolf 110 as Truck Utility Medium (TUM) HS. Where HS stands for High Specification. Land Rover calls it eXtra Duty (XD). The 1992 Snatch Land Rover, fitted with composite armour for ballistic protection, does not use the same “heavy duty” chassis. History The Wolf was marketed in other countries than the UK but many foreign military Land Rover procurement agencies felt they did not need the extra strength and reliability of the Wolf because the older models had passed their own testing and Wolf was too expensive. The vehicles have become a symbol of British forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. In keeping with their hearts and minds philosophy they were chosen for patrol duties instead of armoured fighting vehicles such as the Warrior infantry fighting vehicle. Following a spate of incidents, there has been concern that the unarmoured nature of the Wolf exposes the crews to excessive danger, and they are being supplemented by more heavily armoured vehicles such as the Vector, the Mastiff and the Jackal. The MoD later supplemented the Wolf in theatre with a range of armoured vehicles including the Snatch and Pinzgauer ATV in some utility and liaison roles and the Supercat MWMIK. There were reports that some of this equipment was to be sold at below cost once operations in Iraq were completed as the Treasury had refused to cover the cost of replacement. In Afghanistan \\"an average of one of these vehicles a week\\" was lost to enemy action, and with replacements often arriving late a \\"fifth of the fleet\\" of WMIKs was currently \\"damaged or has been destroyed by enemy fire\\". The MoD is sold off most of the fleet of Wolf 90 Land Rovers because the Bowman radio system is too heavy for it. The 110 version remains in service. Design The Wolf was tested, rejected, upgraded and tested again before the MoD was satisfied. It is far stronger and more reliable than the Land Rover Defender on which it was based. According to James Arbuthnot, the then Minister of State for Defence Procurment, he testitfied to the rigorous trails the Land Rover went through prior to being adopted in the British military: \\"The Land Rover vehicle, known commercially as Defender XD, has been subjected to extensive and rigorous trialling in order to ensure that it can meet the high standards of reliability which are essential for operational military vehicles. Therefore, I am pleased to have been able to announce earlier today that, subject to the satisfactory completion of contractual negotiations, I propose to place an order with Land- Rover for about 8,000 vehicles. That order is worth about £170 million. It will bring substantial industrial and employment benefits to Land-Rover, and enhance the vehicle's already excellent prospects in export markets.\\" Engine choice When the Wolf was designed the engine in the civilian Defenders was the Td5. Land Rover preferred the 300Tdi for the Wolf because the electronics in the Td5 were more complex to manage in the field. The 300Tdi on a Wolf uses a slightly different design of timing cover compared to the civilian version. Reinforced rear axle The testing was extremely rigorous and Salisbury axles kept breaking. The axle was therefore redesigned using stronger internals, hubs and outer casing, making one of the strongest land rover axles ever made. Fibreglass roof The fibreglass roof was far simpler to manufacture over the raised height of the roofbars than the Defender aluminium roof. The production was outsourced. Side-mounted spare wheel Everywhere else where Land Rover tried to mount the spare wheel caused the mountings to break free and it was too heavy for the bonnet. There are 3 versions of mounting, soft top, hard top and quick release. Chassis The chassis is considerably different in design to the standard Defender chassis even though it looks similar. The side walls are standard, most of the rest is bespoke. The additional rear load bed mounting was to take increased weights as the standard chassis kept punching big dents in the rear floor. Chassis made after the production run (service chassis) are slightly different, later ones have a triangular reinforcement behind the front outriggers, none of them have the front round tube going through the main chassis walls as it is more costly to tool and produce although it is stronger. The chassis wasn’t galvanised due to the additional cost it would add. There were also unfounded Health and Safety concerns about the gases involved in welding a galvanised chassis, due to the fact that supplying correct respiratory protection to welders would negate this problem. WMIKs made from the factory had two outriggers in the middle of the chassis instead of just one on a standard Wolf chassis. The second outrigger is to take the extra load of the gun mounting. Many WMIKs were converted from Wolfs and kept one outrigger. The chassis on all Wolfs was sprayed internally with Dinitrol rust proofing. Tyres Goodyear G90s were designed for the project and strengthened on the sidewalls in testing. The Michelin tyres were felt to be better but more expensive and classed as an approved second choice as used on Winterised/Waterproofed Wolfs. Goodyear G90 tyres have been in service on military vehicles for over 20 years. Side lockers Experience from the pre Wolf Military Defender showed that full jerry cans were dangerous and too tight in the lockers, the unusual shaped doors were simply to take full jerrycans more easily. They were never meant to be watertight. The Wolf 90 does not have side lockers but does have mountings to carry jerrycans internally. Other Wolf specific items Wolfs are equipped with a steering guard, to offer improved cross country capability. To keep in line with MOD policy to simplify the stores chain, Wolf vehicles were fitted with 24 volt electrics. This meant supply of simple electrical items such as bulbs was now the same as the rest of the vehicle fleet. FFR (fitted for radio) variants gained a second alternator specifically to power the signals equipment. A rear body roll cage was fitted in all conventionally bodied vehicles and some Wolfs were later upgraded with an extra front roll cage. It is worth noting that this \\"roll cage\\" is not mounted to the chassis, merely the rear body tub and has questionable benefit were the vehicle subjected to being rolled over. The specially designed Ambulance bodied Wolfs have no such protection. To reduce noise and heat from the transmission in compliance with health and safety rules a special heavy duty matting system was designed for the Wolf by 'Wright Off-Road'. These mats weigh about 30 kg, and consist of mats to cover the footwells and transmission tunnel. Not all Wolfs have these mats. The Wolf soft top is made of PVC and the rear flap is fastened either by zippers and Velcro or by Dutch lacing down the sides and elasticated straps to cleats on the tailgate. Versions The MoD procured at least 97 different versions. The basic versions are: * Air drop * Commanders IK * Field Ambulance * Fitted For Radio (FFR) * Helicopter Support Platform * Tropical Field Ambulance * Waterised Weapons Mounted Installation Kit * Weapons Mounted Installation Kit (WMIK) * Winterised * Winterised/Waterproofed * Winterised/Waterproofed Field Ambulance Waterproofed versions have a snorkel that allows the vehicle to wade through water up to windscreen level. Winterised versions are fitted with an engine fluids heater to pre-warm the engine, a heated windscreen and heaters in the rear cabin. The Royal Marines operate the waterproofed version for amphibious assaults. Fitted with a 'periscope' snorkel, waterproofed electrical systems and instruments, and prepared with grease and graphite lubricant on practically every moving part, these versions can run with the entire vehicle submerged if needed. The tailgate is held open by struts to allow water into the vehicle to prevent it floating away, and to allow water to rapidly drain after reaching the shore. In training exercises the vehicles are operated in depths so that the driver's head and shoulders are clear of the water. Alongside the HS/Wolf programme the MOD ran a design project for a new battlefield ambulance vehicle, known as Project Pulse. This was also won by Land Rover with a version of the ultra-long wheelbase Defender 130. Whilst not officially a 'Wolf' the 130 ambulances (with bodies by Marshall Aerospace) used the same chassis and transmission upgrades, identical drivetrains and the same Defender-based front bodywork. Weapons Mount Installation Kit A static British Army WMIK on display. A variant of TUM is the Weapons Mount Installation Kithttps://www.paradata.org.uk/article/land-rover-weapons- mounted-installation-kit-wmik (WMIK, pronounced ‘Wimik’) for use as reconnaissance and close fire support vehicles. WMIKs are manufactured jointly by Land Rover and Ricardo Vehicle Engineering and feature a strengthened chassis and are stripped down, fitted with roll cages and weapon mounts. Initial development started in 1997 as a rapid deployment vehicle concept.https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/2367455.defender-gets-rapid- upgrade/ Some models were initially used in Sierra Leone in Operation Palliser. The first production vehicles were made in 2002 as prototypes to demonstrate to potential clients.http://www.dunsfoldcollection.co.uk/collection/military/a-e-wimik-lhd- demonstrator#v Typically, the vehicle will carry one 12.7 mm Heavy Machine Gun, 7.62 mm General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG) or on occasion the MILAN ATGM, on the rear ring-mount, with an additional pintle-mounted GPMG on the front passenger side. According to Ricardo, it can be modified to install a GIAT 20mm cannon.Jane's International Defense Review: IDR, Volume 31, Issues 5-12, page 55. In late 2006, the MoD announced it was purchasing 40 new belt-fed Automatic Lightweight Grenade Launchers (ALGL) made by Heckler and Koch (HK GMG) that can fire up to 360 grenades per minute with an effective range of 1.5 km and a maximum range of up to 2.2 km; they are to be mounted on WMIKs in Afghanistan. Upgrades In the REMUS project the MoD upgraded its Wolf fleet with Front Roll Over Protection System, rear retracting seat belts, Wright off road front and rear anti vibration acoustic matting wax injection of chassis / bulkhead and chassis underseal. Later upgrades were made with the first one in 2006, 2009 and 2010.http://www.eliteukforces.info/uksf-gear/wmik/ Another upgrade made in 2011, has resulted in the designation RWMIK+ with R meaning Revised.https://www.army.mod.uk/equipment/protected-patrol-vehicles/ This was made in response to incident where British WMIKs were being targeted by insurgents through IEDs and rocket launchers.https://web.archive.org/web/20191024213257/https://www.janes.com/images/assets/593/36593/Wheels_of_the_Elite.pdf Ranger Special Operations Vehicle Civilian usage A fleet of Wolf- specification Defender 110 Hard Top models were built for the proposed Land Rover TransGlobal expedition in 1998. These vehicles were essentially arctic- prepared military models (with 24-volt electrics, convoy lighting, military- spec air intakes, internal insulation and the standard Wolf chassis and suspension upgrades) combined with expedition gear such as winches, a roof rack, roof-mounted tent, roll cage etc. A hydraulic power take-off system was also fitted, intended for powering the vehicles across the Bering Strait on catamaran rafts. The expedition was cancelled only days before the planned departure date, and most of the fleet were auctioned off to the general public. These distinctive vehicles (as well as their high level of equipment, they are painted in the TransGlobal's gold livery) are desirable expedition vehicles, and several have been used on long-range trips by private owners including Land Rover's own Fifty 50 challenge and the Lone Wolf Transglobal Expedition. Wolf as used by German government agencies. Small numbers of ex- military Wolfs have also entered the civilian market. These are usually examples that were crash-damaged in military service and auctioned off, to be rebuilt by their new owners. In 2003, the German government placed an order for a fleet of Land Rover Wolf vehicles for security and law enforcement forces. The fleet consisted of high capacity pick-ups, vans and station wagons. All fleet vehicles were ordered in Bonatti Grey with white roofs (last batch vehicles had grey roofs) and the electrical systems were kept to a minimum with all luxury items such as electric windows, heated seats, radar detector omitted for simplicity. Vehicles were supplied as a mixture of 12 and 24 volt FFR variants, their powerplants being either the standard Td5 turbodiesel engine, or some 3 Litre BMW units. The contract was cancelled in late 2004 after the German government opted for one with Mercedes Benz who supplied their G-Class \\"Gelandewagen\\" in various forms, and a small number of these last batch vehicles were imported and immediately sold-off to the private market.

For 1954, the name was shifted to the luxury Bel Air series station wagon, which featured DI-NOC woodgrain paneling. In both years, all Townsmans were eight-passenger models. In 1955 and 1956, the Townsman was once again a 210, but in 1957 it was available as both a 210 and a Bel Air. All 1955–1957 Townsmans were six- passenger models. A 235.5-cid inline six-cylinder engine was standard power in all five years, with V8s available beginning in 1955.  1969–1972  1970 Chevrolet Townsman station wagon with 454-cid V8 During the second run, the Townsman was based on the rear-wheel drive GM B platform. It came in both six- and nine-passenger versions and only V8s were available, ranging from 327 to 427 cubic inches in 1969, and 350 to 454 cubic inches from 1970 forward. The sedan equivalent in this period was the Bel Air. It was considered a little more deluxe than the Chevrolet Brookwood, but not quite as nice as the Chevrolet Kingswood and Kingswood Estate, which were Impala- and Caprice-level cars, respectively. The 1971–72 wagons featured a 'clamshell' design marketed as the Glide-away tailgate, also called a \\"disappearing\\" tailgate because when open, the tailgate was completely out of view. On the clamshell design, the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof and the lower tailgate (with either manual or optional power operation), lowered completely below the load floor. The manual lower tailgate was counterbalanced by a torque rod similar to the torque rods used in holding a trunk lid open, requiring a 35 lb push to fully lower the gate. Raising the manual gate required a 5 lb pull via a handhold integral to the top edge of the retractable gate. The power operation of both upper glass and lower tailgate became standard equipment in later model years. Wagons with the design featured an optional third row of forward- facing seats accessed by the rear side doors and a folding second-row seat—and could accommodate a 4′ × 8′ sheet of plywood with rear seats folded. The clamshell design required no increased footprint or operational area to open, allowing a user to stand at the cargo opening without impediment of a door—for example, in a closed garage. That year wheelbase also increased from 119″ to 125″, the longest of any Chevrolet regular passenger car ever produced. Most options, aside from power windows and six-way front seat (with driver's control), were available on Townsman (and its less-expensive Brookwood counterpart) wagon models. Midway through the 1971 model year, Turbo HydraMatic transmission was made standard equipment on all full-sized station wagons, including Townsmans; this eliminated the need for customers to have to specifically specify an automatic transmission that virtually every wagon that had been built since the late 1960s was getting anyway. For 1973, Chevrolet eliminated the Townsman and upper-level Kingswood/Kingswood Estate designations for its full-sized station wagons. The Bel Air nameplate continued to be applied to all full-sized wagons through 1975 in the United States, and 1981 in Canada. In both countries, the same model-year changes were applied to Bel Air wagons as its more-expensive Impala and Caprice brethren.

From the front or rear the 1959 Chevrolets resembled nothing else on the road. From the headlights, placed as low as the law would allow, to the cats-eye tail lights, the 1959 Chevrolet was a brand new car with all new sheet metal. The most visual new change was the flat, wing shaped tailfins. The car was built on a wheelbase and was long, which was longer than the 1957 model. This made Chevrolet the longest car in the low-priced range, whereas two years before it had been the shortest. In addition, the car was wider outside and had more width inside than it did in 1958, through the reduction of door thickness. The frame GM X frame had no side rails. The new Kingswood was offered as a mid range full size 4-door only 9 passenger model, with rear-facing 3rd row jump-seat standard. It was positioned between the Parkwood 6-passenger and the Nomad (now Impala based), still at the top was a six-passenger car. Wagons were still classed by themselves, but had model numbers matching the car series. Chevrolet eliminated its entry-level Delray based Yeoman models and the Biscayne-based Brookwood became Chevrolet's least expensive wagon models. Brookwoods were now available in two-door or four-door body styles, both in six-passenger configuration only. The new Parkwood 6-passenger and new Kingswood 9-passenger wagons had Bel Air's model number, and as such were the middle range wagons. A variety of speed options, such as fuel injection, special cams and lowered compression, gave horsepower ratings up to 315. The Nomad was still the top Chevy wagon. A parking brake warning light was optional. Under the hood, little change took place for '59 Chevys.http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet/1959_Chevrolet_Owners_Manual/1959%20Chevrolet%20Manual-04.html Few alterations were made for 1960. The new models were refinements of the 1959 style with a much more restrained front end, the return of the double cone tail lights of 1958 rather than the startling \\"cat's eyes\\" of 1959. Under the hood, things remained constant. Fuel injection was no longer available, but with the 348 cubic inch engine, a horsepower rating of 335 at 5800 rpm was now achieved. This involved the use of three double-barrel carburetors, a special cam and an 11.25:1 compression ratio, all sold as a package. 1960 Chevrolet Kingswood (rear) 1959 Chevrolet Kingswood interior Engines Buyers could order any engine and transmission, including the 348 V8 and the fuel-injected 283 V8 engines. * Blue Flame straight six * to Turbo Fire small block V8 * to W-series Turbo Thrust big block V8 Safety Chevrolet's 1959 and '60 Kingswoods (as well as the rest of Chevy's full size line up) still featured Chevrolet's \\"Safety-Girder\\" cruciform frame introduced in '58. Similar in layout to the frame adopted for the 1957 Cadillac, it featured box- section side rails and a boxed front cross member that bowed under the engine, these \\"X-frames\\" were used on other 1958 to 1964 Chevys, as well as Cadillac. The rear was tied together by a channel-section cross member. This design was later criticized as providing less protection in the event of a side impact collision, but would persevere until 1965.http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1958-chevrolet.htm Discontinuation and replacement General Motors discontinued the Chevrolet Kingswood wagon nameplate after only two years. For 1961 they offered a third row nine- passenger option on Brookwood to fill the void. The wagon only nameplates Brookwood, Parkwood, and Nomad were gone for 1962, instead naming their station wagons after their series names: Biscayne (replacing Brookwood directly), Bel Air and Impala. The 1962-'64 Biscayne, Bel Air, and Impala wagons were very similar to Chevy's 1961 wagon models. 1969-1972 1969 Chevrolet Kingswood The Kingswood name returned for the 1969 model year, based on the Impala, and was available only with a V8. It slotted above the Chevrolet Townsman; a Caprice-based Kingswood Estate model was added at the top of the range with exterior woodgrain paneling. Throughout this period, the Kingswood was available in both two- and three-seat models; a power rear window was initially standard equipment for the latter and optional for the former. For 1971, the power rear window became standard for both models. Midway through the 1971 model year, the Turbo-Hydramatic transmission became standard, and the three-speed manual transmission was eliminated. A Turbo- Hydramatic had been ordered on nearly all Kingswoods built during the late 1960s and early 1970s. For 1973, Chevrolet eliminated the Kingswood Estate/Kingswood, along with their Townsman and Brookwood sister nameplates, for its full-sized station wagons; they now utilized the Bel Air, Impala, and Caprice nameplates from their sedan counterparts.

Located just north of campus on 27th Street and Whitis Avenue, the colonial revival style building was completed in 1922 during a housing shortage on campus and was intended to provide housing for the daughters and relatives of Master Masons. Since its origin the building has relaxed its entry requirements somewhat, but is still well known among UT students for its strict rules against male visitors. It is one of the more expensive private dorms in the UT area. Many girls are wait-listed for entry to the dorm beginning in high school or earlier. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.  Controversy  In November 2018, dormitory director Mary Mazurek and registrar Meshelle Bourne asked student Kaj Baker to meet with them to discuss guest rules. Baker was told she was no longer allowed to bring in guests for the rest of the semester after spending nights studying with her girlfriend in the SRD lounge. Baker claims Mazurek and Bourne took action because some of the residents in the dorm were not comfortable with Baker's sexual orientation despite no rule violations. Scottish Rite Dorm released the following statement regarding the incident: “The Scottish Rite Dorm is aware of the serious issues raised by our resident, Kaj Baker. We are fully investigating what happened, and also contacting Kaj to address her situation directly, which we regret not doing as soon as we learned of her broader concerns. Pending the outcome of our investigation, we are committed to taking the steps needed to ensure all of our residents are safe, welcomed and supported— including sensitivity training for all staff and residents and clarifying SRD’s visitor policy.” {{cite weburl=https://www.facebook.com/texasnewschannel/videos/2242167192692508/} title=Texas News Channel} External links *Scottish Rite Dormitory Homepage References Category:Masonic buildings completed in 1922 Category:Buildings and structures in Austin, Texas Category:Masonic buildings in Texas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Austin, Texas Category:University and college dormitories in the United States Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Texas Category:University and college buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Texas Category:Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks ","title":"Scottish Rite Dormitory"},{"id":"5826257","text":"FC Lada-Tolyatti () is a Russian football club based in Tolyatti.

Description Laufeia species are mostly small, hairy, brownish spiders. The chelicera usually has a tooth with two cusps on the rear-facing edge. The male generally has a slightly hardened plate (scutum) on the upper surface of the abdomen. The genitalia vary considerably between species; for example, the male palpal bulb has either a long or short embolus, which may or may not be coiled. Taxonomy The genus Laufeia was erected by Eugène Simon in 1889 for the type species Laufeia aenea, which had been collected in Yokohama, Japan. Simon did not explain the origin of the genus name. In Norse mythology, Laufeia was the mother of the god Loki. Four more Laufeia species were known to Andrzej Bohdanowicz and Jerzy Prószyński in 1987; they doubted that three of them belonged in the genus. In 2012, Prószyński and Christa Deeleman-Reinhold split off some Laufeia species into the genera Orcevia and Junxattus, noting the diversity of genital structures. A molecular and morphological study in 2015 showed that the original circumscription of Laufeia constituted a strongly supported clade, and Junxia Zhang and Wayne Maddison restored all the species to Laufeia, arguing that strong sexual selection could produce genital diversity even in closely related species.

E: also this biography of Access Genealogy was a United States Army scout, Indian agent, prospector, and superintendent of overland mail in the Arizona Territory. His friendship with Apache leader Cochise was instrumental in ending the Indian wars in that region.\\"Tom Jeffords: Indian Agent\\" by Harry G. Cramer III (Tucson: Journal of Arizona History, Autumn, 1976, pp. 265-300) He first met Cochise when he rode alone into Cochise's camp in 1871 to request that the chief come to Canada Alamosa for peace talks. Cochise declined at least in part because he was afraid to travel with his family after the recent Camp Grant Massacre. Three months later he made the trip and stayed for over six months during which time their friendship grew while the negotiations failed. Cochise was unwilling to accept the Tularosa Valley as his reservation and home. In October 1872, Jeffords led General Oliver O. Howard to Cochise's Stronghold, believed to be China Meadow, in the Dragoon Mountains. Cochise demanded and got the Dragoon and Chiricahua Mountains as his reservation and Tom Jeffords as his agent. From 1872 to 1876, there was peace in southern Arizona. Then renegade Apaches killed Nicholas Rogers who had sold them whiskey and the cry went out to abolish the reservation and remove Jeffords as agent. Tom Jeffords embarked on a series of ventures as sutler and postmaster at Fort Huachuca, head of the first Tucson water company trying to bring artesian water to that city, and as prospector and mine owner and developer. He died at Owl Head Buttes in the Tortolita Mountains 35 miles north of Tucson. Early life Tom Jeffords was born in Chautauqua County, New York, where his father was trying to earn enough money to purchase a farm. When Tom was seven, he moved the family to Ashtabula, Ohio, in the Western Reserve. Tom and his brothers sailed the Great Lakes and Tom became a ship's captain while still in his early twenties. Bored and in search of wealth, Tom followed the gold rush to Pike's Peak in 1859 building the road from Leavenworth to Denver. From there he pursued the San Juan Gold Rush of 1860 to Taos County, New Mexico, and that same year followed the Colorado Gold Rush to Gila City in Arizona. He soon moved on to the Pinos Altos, New Mexico, gold rush. The Civil War found Tom near Fort Craig and he participated in the Battle of Valverde as a civilian courier. Jeffords accepted an assignment from Colonel Edward Canby to ride over 500 miles alone across Apache country to Fort Yuma, California, where Colonel James Carleton was coming with the California Column. Since Confederate forces had invaded southern New Mexico and occupied the countryside as far as Tucson, Colonel Canby needed a brave courier who knew the route through the wilds along the Gila River to carry messages. Tom Jeffords returned east to Arizona Territory in 1862 as a scout with the lead companies of the California Column. He remained with the Army as a civilian scout throughout the war as the Army engaged Navajo, Apache and Comanche Indians and kept the Texans out of New Mexico. Bascom Affair Open war with the Chiricahua Apaches had begun in 1861, when Cochise, one of their chiefs, was accused by the Army of kidnapping an 11-year-old Mexican boy, Felix Ward, stepson of Johnny Ward, later known as Mickey Free. Although the abduction was probably the work of Pinal Indians, a clear trail led to Cochise's doorstep. Reassignment of two companies of dragoon cavalry to Fort Breckinridge on the lower San Pedro River had forced the Pinal, Coyotero and other Western Apaches to alter their raiding routes so that they swung east toward the Chiricahua Mountains and Apache Pass. Lieutenant George Nicholas Bascom was sent with 66 men of Company C, 7th Infantry, which he commanded, to get the boy back. Johnny Ward went along as interpreter. The lieutenant invited Cochise to his camp for parley and they retired to the lieutenant's tent for lunch and talk along with his brother, Coyuntura, and Ward. Bascom told Cochise that he wanted the boy and Ward's stolen livestock. This was not the first time that Cochise had been forced to return stolen stock. Captain Richard S. Ewell had been out to Apache Pass twice before to recover stock and had sworn he would, \\"proceed to force them to terms the next time\\". Cochise said he did not have them but thought he knew who did. Bascom told the chief he would be a hostage against the boy's safe return. Cochise's father and brothers had been slain by Mexicans during parley and his people had been poisoned. Hearing that he would be a hostage, Cochise pulled his knife, slashed the ties of the tent, and escaped up Overlook Ridge. His brother, his son and nephew, two warriors and his wife remained as hostages. Meeting the next day, Cochise violated the flag of truce and took his own hostage. In following days, he took three more. Surrounded by what he believed were 500 Apaches, Bascom sent for aid. The first to arrived was Surgeon Bernard Irwin, who took three more hostages on his way to rescue Bascom while leading only eleven men. He was awarded the Medal of Honor 32 years later for this action. Cochise killed and possibly tortured his four hostages. Two troops of dragoons arrived under command of Lieutenants Isaiah Moore and Richard Lord, both senior to Bascom. Moore took command. Irwin proposed hanging the six Apache hostages (the woman and boys were released at Fort Buchanan). Bascom demurred but, outranked, allowed the hanging. Cochise, formerly inclined toward peace with the white settlers, now joined other Apache chiefs in hostility to them. It was not long before the Army retaliated, and the war was on. Between 1867 and 1869, Jeffords was the superintendent of a mail line from Tucson to Socorro. He apparently gave people to understand that he had met Cochise during this period and negotiated a peace for his mail riders. This is very unlikely as they were attacked as often, seldom, after he took charge as before. In 1871 President Grant sent General Oliver Howard to the Arizona Territory with orders to end the Apache wars by negotiating treaties with the tribes. Howard was an apt choice, as he had been head of the Freedmen's Bureau, the agency responsible for assisting freed black slaves after the Civil War. General Howard enlisted the help of Jeffords in concluding these treaties. Learning of his work with the Freedmen's Bureau, Jeffords knew that Howard was honorable and would be respected by Cochise, and eventually conducted the general into Cochise's camp. A treaty was signed in 1872, ending the decade-long war with the Chiricahua Apaches. Cochise requested that his people be allowed to remain in the Chiricahua Mountains and that Jeffords be made Indian agent for the region. These requests were granted, and the Indian raids subsided. Settlers branded Jeffords \\"Indian lover\\" and wrote scathing reports to politicians back in Washington. In 1875, he was removed as the federal agent and the Chiricahua Apaches were relocated to the San Carlos Reservation. Cochise was spared this; he had died of natural causes about a year after signing the now broken treaty. The Apache wars began again, but were ended in 1886 with the surrender of Geronimo, the last Apache leader. Later life and death Jeffords relocated to Tombstone, AZ, where he was part owner of a number of mines. He staked claims in the Huachuca, Dos Cabezas, and Chiricahua Mountains. With Nicholas Rogers and Sidney De Long, he staked a claim to the famed Brunckow Mine in 1875 and remained in control of it into the 1880s. He was a partner in a mine in the Santa Ritas and head of a company trying to supply water to the city of Tucson. He lived out the last 22 years of his life in the Tortolita Mountains north of Tucson, Arizona, at a homestead near the Owlhead Buttes. He died on February 19, 1914, and was buried in Tucson's Evergreen Cemetery. A monument was dedicated to Jeffords in Evergreen Cemetery in 1964. In popular culture The story of Jeffords, General Howard, Cochise, and the Apache wars was told in historically-based but dramatized form in a novel by Elliott Arnold called Blood Brother. The novel was adapted into the Delmer Daves's film Broken Arrow (1950). James Stewart played Jeffords in the movie. It was later adapted into a 1956 television show that ran for 72 episodes, in which John Lupton played Jeffords.

One of these hadith quotes Muhammad as saying (in his Farewell Sermon): Sunni Muslims generally accept this hadith as authentic (sahih); whereas Shi'a Muslims reject it as fabricated or inauthentic (mawdoo). Background John Esposito explains the importance of the Quran and the Sunnah in Islam: \\"the Prophet Muhammad is seen as the 'living Quran,' the embodiment of God's will in his behavior and words. Sunni Muslims ... take their name from sunnah, meaning those who follow the example of the Prophet.\\" Prof. Fatih Okumus refers to Muhammad as \\"the walking Qur’an,\\" with the Sunnah giving an example to follow. Both Sunni and Shia Muslims agree on the general importance of following both the Quran and the Sunnah. However, they may disagree as to whether some hadith or tradition forms part of the Sunnah in the first place. As the sayings and deeds of Muhammad were reported via many different sources, there was disagreement about what constituted sunnah, and how that affects what should be shariah. Relationship to the Hadith al-Thaqalayn Both Sunni and Shi'a Muslims accept the authenticity of the similar hadith of the two weighty things (Hadith al-Thaqalayn): The Hadith al-Thaqalayn holds special importance for Shi'a Muslims, because they perceive it to provide support for the succession of Ali (a member of Muhammad's own family, or Ahl al-Bayt) rather than Abu Bakr (who was not a family member). Shi'as view the Hadith al-Thaqalayn as a clear indication that Muhammad wished to keep the matter of leadership within his own family. It is based on this claim that the Shi'as reject the first three Sunni caliphs. Sunnis, by contrast, recognize the Hadith al-Thaqalayn as sahih but see it as mandating respectful obedience to members of the Ahl al-Bayt, rather than pertaining to succession. Sunni view The hadith of the Quran and Sunnah appears in the Muwatta Imam Malik, often identified as one of the six most authentic books of hadith (Kutub al- Sittah) in the Sunni tradition. Versions of this hadith (with slight variations) are cited in many Sunni collections. Among these are: *Al-Jami'li- Akhlaq al-Rawi, an 11th-century collection by Al-Khatib al-BaghdadiVol 1 p111, 1983 ed. *Sunan al-Daraqutni, a tenth-century collection by Al-DaraqutniVol 4 p.245 #149 *, an eighth-century biography of the Prophet by Ibn Hishamvol6 p.8-10 This hadith is considered sahih (authentic) by the following Sunni scholars: *Hakim al-NishaburiAs stated in his book Mustadrak al-Hakim, vol 1 p 93 *Ibn Abd al-BarrAs stated in his work Tamhid, vol 24 p 331 *Ibn HazmAs stated in his work al-Ihkam vol 6 p 243 The Sunnis generally accept this hadith, but narrowly define sunnah as the sayings and deeds of Muhammad. From a Sunni viewpoint, the Shi'a definition of sunnah is too broad; it includes Muhammad's \\"implicit approvals\\" and even the sayings of imams other than Muhammad. Relative priority of Quran versus Sunnah In the ninth century Al-Shafi‘i took the view that the Quran superseded sunnah, and that sunnah could not supersede the text of the Quran. In this he rejected versions of the above hadith which claimed equal weight for the Quran and the Sunnah. (See Shafi‘i.) Others, notably Ibn Kathir in his book Al-Bidaya wa'l-Nihaya, took the reverse position that sunnah, being a later revelation, should take precedence over the Quran. Shia view Shi'as reject the hadith of the Quran and Sunnah, deeming it to be a fabrication designed to distract from another saying of Muhammad — the Hadith al-Thaqalayn — by replacing the latter's specific and pointed reference to Muhammad's Ahl al-Bayt with a generic reference to the sunnah. The Shi'as believe that the Hadith al-Thaqalayn is mutawattir, meaning that it has been related so many times by so many people that there is no doubt about its authenticity.
