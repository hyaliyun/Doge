Its variations include Karnapidasana with the knees by the ears, and Supta Konasana with the feet wide apart. Etymology and origins The completed pose resembles a traditional plough. The health and beauty guru Marguerite Agniel in plough pose, c. 1928. Photograph by John de Mirjian The name comes from Sanskrit ‡§π‡§≤‡§æ hala, \\"plough\\" and ‡§Ü‡§∏‡§® ƒÅsana, \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". The pose is described and illustrated in the 19th century Sritattvanidhi as LƒÅ·πágalƒÅsana, which also means plough pose in Sanskrit. Karnapidasana is not found in the medieval hatha yoga texts. It is described independently in Swami Vishnudevananda's 1960 Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga in the Sivananda Yoga tradition, and by B. K. S. Iyengar in his 1966 Light on Yoga, implying that it may have older origins. The name comes from the Sanskrit words kar·πáa (‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§£) meaning \\"ears\\", pƒ´·∏ç (‡§™‡•Ä‡§°‡•ç) meaning \\"to squeeze\\", and ƒÅsana (‡§Ü‡§∏‡§®) meaning \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". Description The pose is entered from Sarvangasana (shoulderstand), lowering the back slightly for balance, and moving the arms and legs over the head until the outstretched toes touch the ground and the fingertips, in a preparatory variant of the pose. The arms may then be moved to support the back into a more vertical position, giving a second variant pose. Finally, the arms may be stretched out on the ground away from the feet, giving the final pose in the shape of a traditional plough. Variations Karnapidasana, with variant arm position Karnapidasana (Ear pressing pose) or Raja Halasana (Royal plough pose) has the knees bent close to the head and grasped by the arms. Parsva Halasana (Sideways plough) with the body vertical, the trunk twisted to one side, and legs out straight with the feet touching the ground (to that side). Supta Konasana (Supine angle pose) has the legs as wide apart as possible, the toes on the ground; the fingertips may grasp the big toes. All these variations may be performed as part of a cycle starting from Sarvangasana (Shoulderstand). Claims Twentieth century advocates of some schools of yoga, such as B. K. S. Iyengar, made claims for the effects of yoga on specific organs, without adducing any evidence. Iyengar claimed that this pose brought \\"the same\\" benefits as Sarvangasana, with the additional benefit of relief of backache, but unlike that pose was recommended for people with high blood pressure. Cautions Plough pose can put significant strain on the cervical spine, which does not normally undergo this type of stress, and can cause injury if not performed properly.

Encyclopedia of Percussion. Taylor and Francis, 1995. or Chinese bell tree https://omeka1.grinnell.edu/MusicalInstruments/items/show/403 (often confused with the mark tree), is a percussion instrument, consisting of vertically nested inverted metal bowls. The bowls, placed on a vertical rod, are arranged roughly in order of pitch. The number of bowls can vary between approximately 14 and 28. An effective glissando is produced by sliding a triangle beater, a glockenspiel mallet, or a xylophone mallet down the length of the tree. The bells are usually pitched to microtonal intervals and do not represent any formal scale. When a glissando is played, the inexactness of the order of the bowls' pitch is unnoticeable, merely creating a fuller sound. The bell tree is often used to accentuate the start or end of passages of music with a \\"bright\\", \\"shimmer\\" effect, adding complexity. Chick Corea and his group Return To Forever occasionally used the bell tree (i.e. album Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy), as has the group Santana. Isaac Howie has sometimes used the bell tree in his compositions. The classic rock band America utilized one in Bell Tree, a song named for the instrument, found on their 1975 album Hearts.

He was the first count of Loritello in 1061. Like his father, he began his military conquests in the Abruzzi, encroaching on lands held by the Roman pontiff. He advanced as far as Ortona in 1070, a year before his father's death. Unsurprisingly, he was excommunicated (February 1075). Pope Gregory VII speaks of his \\"Godless insolence.\\" Where Duke Robert Guiscard and Prince Richard of Capua had failed to expand northwards, Robert of Loritello and Richard's son Jordan had success. By 1075, Robert was making his seat at Chieti. While Jordan advanced in the district around Lake Fucino, Robert advanced up the Adriatic coast. He made his brother Drogo count of Chieti (or Teate). In 1076, Ortona finally fell with the assistance of troops from Robert Guiscard. The local Lombard nobility, as far as the Pescara, did homage to him. He had five hundred knights under his command. In return for his uncle's help, he sent a contingent of his own men to assist in the defeat of his cousin Abelard in Sant'Agata di Puglia. In June 1080, Gregory VII recognised the Norman conquests of Robert and Jordan up to Fermo. In June 1083, besieged in the Castel Sant'Angelo by the Emperor Henry IV, the pope begged the assistance of the duke. The two Roberts, uncle and nephew, came to his rescue. Robert took part in the second Byzantine expedition of his uncle's in 1084‚Äì1085. He was at the Guiscard's deathbed and remained loyal to his uncle's chosen heir, Roger Borsa, whose guardian he had been. He continued his conquests and before his death had made it beyond the Fortore and as far as the Tronto. He ruled from Bovino (conquered 1100) to Ascoli Piceno. He may have even ruled Dragonara. By the end of his life, he had taken the titles comes Dei gratia (count by the grace of God) and comes comitorum (count of counts). He was succeeded by his son, Robert II of Loritello.

Jinjang comprises Jinjang Utara (North) and Jinjang Selatan (South). It used to be known for the prevalence of gangsterism from the 1960s but is now a largely residential area. Etymology of the name Jinjang name was direct copy of famous town Jinjiang in Fujian province. It has been surmised that the name Jinjang was derived from the name of a pig brought to Malaya by a Chinese merchant in the 19th century. The pig was believed to be auspicious. The name Jinjang might also be derived from the mispronunciation of the Chinese word ‚ÄúZeng Guang‚Äù.http://www.utar.edu.my/dssc/file/NV%20report%20E%20Jinjang%20Kuala%20Lumpur.pdf History The town was established as part of the British strategy called the Briggs' Plan during the Malayan Emergency. The strategy aimed to forcibly relocate Malayan people, particularly ethnic Chinese, to isolate them from the Communists' influence. Jinjang was by far the largest of the relocation communities (called \\"New Villages\\") on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, at 445 hectares (4.45 km2), nearly twice the size of the other New Villages combined. During early post-independence years until the 1960s, the town gained a \\"fearsome\\" reputation due to the presence of triad members; the notorious \\"Robin Hood\\" criminal Botak Chin was said to have been active in the area. Older residents surmised that the area's alleged seedy reputation likely stemmed from the fact that most early inhabitants were working-class and thus viewed with prejudice. Along with the township of Kepong, Jinjang has been particularly prone to outbreaks of dengue fever,Asiaweek, Volume 15, Issues 1-26 (1989). and the outbreak of the 1973 dengue epidemic which resulted in 969 reported cases and killed 54 people was traced to Jinjang.BioSciences Information Service of Biological Abstracts (1980): Abstracts of entomology, Volume 11.

Overview The show took an intense, no-nonsense look at the present-day Los Angeles Police Department's Robbery Homicide Division. Lt. Sam Cole is the driven chief detective of a squad that is dedicated to solving some of the worst crimes the city has to offer. There were several technical advisers who worked on the show: Chic Daniel, an LAPD living legend who served more than twenty years on SWAT; Robert Deamer, a specialist of gang enforcement who is one of the most decorated veterans of Special Enforcement Unit (ex-C.R.A.S.H.); and Lieutenant Todd Reinhold, an actual squad leader of Special Weapons And Tactics. The series was originally titled Metro which was the division where the show was originally going to be set. Then, the title was changed to RHD/LA which was used for the fall schedule announcement. CBS ordered the final title believing that people would be confused about what RHD stood for. In April 2002, Schindel left to focus on his duties at NBC's Law & Order. Frank Spotnitz joined the show as an executive producer and the showrunner in May 2002 after The X-Files ended its nine-season run and then left in October because he decided that it \\"was not creatively the show that he wanted to be working on.\\" Thematically, the show was very reminiscent of Mann's film Heat in that it also dealt with a driven cop working the Robbery- Homicide Division leading a multi-ethnic squad. Stylistically, Mann has said that RHD was a chance to test out some of the high-definition digital cameras he would later employ to much greater effect on Collateral and the film version of Miami Vice.

Albert Simms Episodes ;Notes Cancellation Although RHD was critically acclaimed, Law & Order: SVU had better ratings in the same time slot. CBS placed the show on hiatus after the December 7th episode. The series was cancelled after ten episodes. Mann told Variety magazine, \\"I guess maybe the show never found its audience.\\" There was possible interest by HBO or CBS sister network Showtime to pick up the series, but it never went further than speculation. Because of its NBC Universal ownership, reruns of the series have since aired on the high definition network Universal HD. It is rumored that the arrest of Tom Sizemore, due to a drug related incident, ultimately led to the cancellation of the show. Sizemore has stated during filming of his show Shooting Sizemore that he regrets letting down all the cast members, staff, and producer Michael Mann. The actor claims that the cancellation created a rift between him and close mentor Mann which has still not been resolved.Shooting Sizemore, Final Episode. http://www.vh1.com/video/misc/133575/the-end- act-2-improvements.jhtml#id=1552447 Reception In her review for The New York Times, Caryn James wrote, \\"The executive producers, Mr. Mann and Frank Spotnitz (a producer of The X-Files), have created a style that does not dominate substance so much as it makes a dark subject palatable.\\" Chicago Sun- Times gave the show three out of four stars and Phil Rosenthal felt that the show, \\"holds a lot of promise, but a lot of that promise remains unrealized in this opener. It's just a little confusing.\\" The Los Angeles Daily News gave the show three out of four star and David Kronke felt that the \\"storytelling may be spotty - convenient contrivances help our heroes to their resolutions - but the richly cinematic quality of the programs make them seem deeper, smarter and more resonant than they really are. The series is also adept at capturing Los Angeles' multiculturalism, though it seems to insist upon depicting it as somewhat sinister.\\" USA Today gave the show two out of four stars and felt that it was \\"all style and no story.\\" In his review for the Washington Post, Tom Shales praised Tom Sizemore's performance: \\"What saves it, really, is the key performance: Tom Sizemore as Detective Sam Cole, head of one of those elite teams inside the police force that get to dress well and barge in without search warrants and so on. Sizemore veritably storms the screen in one of those can't-look-away performances that make a character instantly indelible. You feel you recognize Sam Cole and yet never saw anyone exactly like him before.\\" In his review for the San Francisco Chronicle, Tim Goodman wrote that the show, \\"plays out like a moody film.\\" Other reviews: *Canoehttp://jam.canoe.ca/Television/TV_Shows/R/Robbery_Homicide_Division/2002/09/27/733436.html *Entertainment Weeklyhttps://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,348134,00.html11 One- Season TV Wonders *SF Gatehttp://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Robbery- s-cancellation-a-huge-loss-2744702.php Ratings The show debuted on Friday at 10pm ET/9c to an anemic 8.41 million viewers.

The steel-framed bridge, with a wooden deck, was built in 1893 to replace a prior wooden covered bridge that was built on the same site circa 1836. In fact, the 1893 bridge utilized the same piers that were built for the earlier bridge. The primary reason for construction of the new bridge was to accommodate the new electric streetcars that were being deployed in Wheeling. With the construction of the Steel Bridge across the main channel of the Ohio River from Wheeling Island to the City of Wheeling circa 1889 electric streetcar service was expanded into Ohio, eventually stretching all the way west to the small mining town of Barton, which is approximately west of Wheeling. The bridge's traffic moved to an alternative bridge in 1998 and the bridge was demolished in 2011. The bridge was documented by the Historic American Engineering Record program, which provided the following description of its significance in approximately 1987:In 1987 or so, there were plans for the building of a replacement vehicular bridge nearby, upstream. It was expected that the Bridgeport bridge would remain as a pedestrian and bicycle bridge. The wooden bridge deck was replaced in 1950 with steel grating, and the streetcar tracks were removed, as interurban rail service was discontinued in 1948. By 1987, the floor beams had become structurally unsound for automobile traffic due to extensive corrosion. A self-supporting, load-bearing deck structure, known as a Bailey Truss, was installed inside the trusses of the Bridgeport Bridge. This was only a temporary measure, as the bridge was replaced in 1998 with the adjacent Military Order of the Purple Heart Bridge. Sometime in 2009 much of the temporary Bailey Truss was removed. It is unclear if the steel grate floor had been removed prior to the installation of the Bailey Truss, but after the removal of its floor structure the Bridgeport Bridge was without a floor. In 2009, it was announced that the bridge would be demolished, and the cost of demolishing the bridge was estimated to be less than $200,000. Early in the summer of 2011, WTOV-TV in Steubenville reported that the bridge was to be demolished, with demolition tentatively scheduled to start at the end of July 2011. They reported that the West Virginia Division of Highways received a request from the U.S. Coast Guard to bring the bridge down as it was a safety hazard and pieces had fallen into the river. It also verified that many of the unique features of the bridge, such as the railings, signage, the finials on top, and plaques would be removed prior to demolition. The bridge demolition was expected to take 60 days and cost $750,000.00, which was considerably less than a $1.2 million estimate for demolition costs that had been given in 2000. Explosive demolition of the bridge occurred on Monday, September 12, 2011. Explosive charges were used to drop the bridge into the river, after which cranes began retrieving the steel parts for scrapping. Complete removal of bridge and piers was scheduled to be completed by October 31, 2011.

Types of slave catchers =Law enforcement= Colonial times saw the emergence of local law enforcement squads. In the North, these were the watchmen, who were paid small fees by private citizens to police the streets and maintain order in their areas. The first groups in the South were slave patrols, which were made up of both slave owners and non-slave owners, and were also paid by private citizens. However, the parcels of land in the South were much larger, and therefore much harder to patrol. Groups that focused on slave hunting were most prevalent in the South, as the majority of slave owners resided there. Contrary to popular belief, slave patrols were not composed solely of men. Women who owned slaves also took part, but no case of free blacks hunting slaves was recorded in the United StatesThe Fugitive Slave Law and Its Victims.New York: The American Anti-Slavery Society. Jackson, Kellie Carter (2019). Force and Freedom: Black Abolitionists and the Politics of Violence. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. pp. 60-61 . Nearly any prospecting individual could set out to be a slave hunter, but few were able to find much success.Lubet, Steven (2010). Fugitive Justice: Runaways, Rescuers, and Slavery on Trial. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. pp. 234. . These Southern law enforcement groups were created out of a need to maintain order among slaves and slave owners, rather than to protect the interests of the common, non-slaveholding people. Many Southern slave owners were considered irresponsible if their charges were allowed to escape, and it was a fear that more escapes would upend the system if not met with retribution. It was believed to be in the general interest of all slaveholders to maintain discipline so that slaves did not have the chance to start an uprising. The very first slave patrollers began their work in the Caribbean during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. They were primarily English and Spanish colonists who volunteered in order to keep a handle on the growing numbers of slaves. They were not terribly successful, as their territories were large and difficult to police. Consequently, many slaves were able to escape to the North, where abolitionists and local governments sheltered them.Lubet, Steven (2010). Fugitive Justice: Runaways, Rescuers, and Slavery on Trial. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. pp. 1. . Many states allowed local law enforcement to enlist the help of federal marshals, U.S. commissioners, and other local citizens. This spread to more states with the ratification of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which required all citizens and local law enforcement to aid in the capture of runaway slaves. This meant that Northerners and abolitionists were forced to comply with slave hunters, although they often found ways to evade the policy. Up until this point, many states did their best to thwart slave catchers by passing decrees such as Massachusetts‚Äô personal liberty statute of 1842, which barred slave catchers from seeking the aid of state officials. However, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 nullified these formal efforts, and abolitionists were forced to resort to small acts of defiance instead. In many areas it could actually be dangerous to be a part of a slave-catching group, due to the hostility of the locals.Lubet, Steven (2010). Fugitive Justice: Runaways, Rescuers, and Slavery on Trial. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. pp. 133. . Under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, slave hunters could easily obtain an Order of Removal, which approved the return of a runaway slave. However, these orders were often met with resistance from Northern abolitionists, who tried to intervene by blocking entry to the room where a fugitive was being held.Lubet, Steven (2010). Fugitive Justice: Runaways, Rescuers, and Slavery on Trial. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. pp. 2. . Local government tried to shut this practice down by offering law enforcement agents a greater reward for returning a slave to the South than they could get from abolitionists who were willing to pay police to look the other way. During the Civil War, these law enforcement groups met with great difficulty, primarily because most of the white men were off fighting in the war. With the men gone, the duty to keep slaves in line fell on the women, who also had households to run. Lack of punishment and a greater likelihood of successful escape caused more and more slaves to run away. With slave patrols stretched so thin, many slaves were able to escape, and were often aided by enemy invaders. Many of the slaves joined Union ranks, the United States Colored Troops, taking up arms against their former owners. =Mercenaries= In the Southern states, any person could capture an escaped slave and turn them over to law enforcement to receive compensation, and slaveowners could also put out advertisements promising a reward for anyone who captured their slaves. Slaveowners also hired people who made a living catching fugitive slaves. Since these slave catchers charged by the day and mile, many of them would travel long distances to hunt for fugitives. Slave catchers often used tracking dogs to sniff out their targets; these were called \\"negro dogs,\\" and, though they could be of multiple breeds, they were typically bloodhounds. However, hiring people to catch slaves was most effective if the slave catcher was in close proximity, as if they were not, they would have less of a chance of staying on the escaped slave's trail. Slaves reaching the Northern states, which did not recognize slavery as valid, made a slave catcher's job substantially more difficult; even if they did find the fugitive they were likely to face resistance from anti-slavery citizens. If a slave managed to escape this far, slave owners typically sent an agent more closely connected to them, or put out notices about the escaped slave. Fugitive slave laws White abolitionists and anyone else aiding in freeing or hiding of slaves were punished for their efforts. One account of drastic fugitive slave catching was approximately 200 U.S. Marines escorting one fugitive slave back into the custody of his owner. As laws even in the North punished both the people who helped slaves escape as well as the fugitive slaves, many fled to Canada where slavery has remained illegal since 1833. By the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, slave catchers' jobs were made easier by the mandating of government officials to locate and prosecute runaway slaves, giving slave catchers more freedom to act under the law. With this law, slave catchers were reportedly able to gain warrants to apprehend those identified as fugitive slaves. Northern responses The North became increasingly opposed to the idea of fugitive slave catchers. Several Northern states passed new personal liberty laws in defiance of the South's efforts to have slaves captured and returned. Slave-catching was allowed in the North and the new laws in the North did not make it impossible to catch fugitive slaves. However, it became so difficult, expensive, and time-consuming that the fugitive slave catchers and the owners stopped trying. The Fugitive Slave Act strengthened abolitionist response against slave catchers, with abolitionist groups including the Free Soil Party advocating for the use of firearms to stop slave catchers and kidnappers, comparing it to the American Revolution. The 1850s saw a significant rise in violent conflicts between abolitionists and law enforcement, with large groups forming to counter activities that threatened fugitive slaves.

(or Gary Glitter) is the title of Gary Glitter's third studio album, which was released in 1975. The album was an attempt by Glitter to change his musical direction from the usual heavy glam rock he had been recording. It was produced by Mark Munro, unlike Glitter's previous efforts which were done by Mike Leander. Also unlike his previous albums, Glitter had very little to do with the composing of the songs, having only one credit as a songwriter on \\"I'll Carry Your Picture (Everywhere)\\" (it was the B-side of the hit single \\"Love Like You and Me\\"). As well as attempting to broaden his style, the album was also an attempt to break Glitter into the music market of the United States. Though Glitter had previously had hits there in 1973 with \\"Rock and Roll\\" and \\"I Didn't Know I Loved You (Til I Saw You Rock 'n' Roll)\\" and some further minor success with his debut album Glitter, his follow-ups didn't do as well as in other countries. Ironically, the G.G. album (or any singles from it) was never released in the USA. Back in the United Kingdom, Glitter's homeland, the first single from the album \\"Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow\\", stalled outside the top 30. It was his worst chart showing to date, his 11 previous singles all having reached the top 10. The album also performed poorly compared to his previous efforts. \\"Satan's Daughter\\", a track composed for Glitter by Haras Fyre, was scheduled to be the follow-up single to \\"Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow\\" in early 1976, However, Glitter's record label were worried about the decline in record sales and the hundreds of unsold tickets at most venues on his current tour. To try to sell tickets (and records) they staged a publicity stunt saying Glitter would be retiring from live performing. As a result, the tour sold out, but they virtually stopped promoting the G.G. album and \\"Satan's Daughter\\" was never issued as a single. Instead, Bell Records opted for a 'safer' bet with the disco/rock number \\"You Belong to Me\\", which charted that year (this song was not included on the album in question). Although the G. G. album never charted in the UK, it has since picked up a cult following in ongoing years and eventually reached a world sales figure in the region of 300,000 copies. Over the years it has been available on most major formats, including vinyl, audio tape, CD and 8-track. 2009 Reissue The album was reissued in 2009 under Airmail Records including three bonus tracks: \\"Love Like You And Me\\", \\"Doing Alright With The Boys\\" and \\"She-Cat, Alley Cat\\".

Photograph taken in February 2007. Sri Petaling (also known as Bandar Baru Sri Petaling) is a suburb of Kuala Lumpur, in Malaysia. The township is located in the south of the city, within the constituency of Seputeh, and is bordered by the towns of Happy Garden, Kuchai Lama and Bukit Jalil. Distance Sri Petaling has easy access to the Government departments in Putrajaya, which is the administrative capital of Malaysia, to Cyberjaya and to the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Sepang International Circuit (former venue for the Formula One Malaysian Grand Prix) is only twenty-five minutes away, Kuala Lumpur city centre, Petaling Jaya, Subang Jaya, Damansara and Puchong are 15 minutes away, Shah Alam is 20 minutes away, and the royal town of Klang is 45 minutes away. History Bandar Baru Sri Petaling was first launched in 1977 and developed in 1981. The area that was developed into the town consisted of former rubber plantation estates. From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s it was widely known as the 'rubbish area' as it was the location of a landfill site. Garbage disposal was discontinued and the land it had occupied turned into a playground and car park area for the 1998 Commonwealth Games.https://www.nst.com.my/news/2015/09/rubber-trees-real-estate The three areas of Sri Petaling that were first developed for residential use were the areas of Jalan Puteri Senggang near the main road, Jalan Wan Empok 1 and Jalan Wan Empok 2. These were the main residential areas of Sri Petaling in the 1980s and the houses were sold for between RM40,000 and RM60,000. By 2010, the value of the houses had increased to RM500,000-RM1,000,000 although the area mostly consists of leasehold titles. The population in Sri Petaling was not high in the early 1980s as it was relatively distant from the city of Kuala Lumpur and a little isolated. The population grew in the late 1980s when two routes of access were opened to neighbouring suburbs; one to Salak Selatan, also known as Salak South, and another to Taman Gembira, or Happy Garden. Over the course of the next decade, development continued and the population grew. In 1997, the Shah Alam Expressway (KESAS) was opened, allowing people to travel to Subang Jaya within as little as 10 minutes, and further towards Shah Alam and Klang. The opening of the Shah Alam Expressway was one of the reasons for the rapid growth in Sri Petaling. In 2007, the Maju Expressway (MEX) opened, a dedicated highway connecting the Kuala Lumpur city centre to Putrajaya with Sri Petaling as one of its exits. The expressway connects residents to the city centre, Putrajaya, Cyberjaya, and the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. In 2020, Sri Petaling has been associated with being Southeast Asia's COVID-19 hotspot during the COVID-19 global pandemic. The virus was spread at a tabligh event held at the Sri Petaling mosque. There were 16,000 attendees, including 1,500 foreigners. Multiple Covid-19 cases related to this event had popped up across Southeast Asia. It is uncertain who the virus originated from at the event. Majority of Malaysian COVID-19 cases during the pandemic are linked to this event. https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/03/23/covid-19-62-of-cases-linked- to-sri-petaling-mosque-event-says-health-dg https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2020/03/575560/how-sri-petaling-tabligh- became-southeast-asias-covid-19-hotspot Transport Sri Petaling is a vibrant, self-contained suburban township with excellent infrastructure. The township is located just 15 km south of Kuala Lumpur city centre and is easily accessible from major highways such as the Kuala Lumpur‚ÄìSeremban Expressway, Shah Alam Expressway (KESAS), New Pantai Expressway (NPE), Middle Ring Road 2 (MRR2) and the Maju Expressway (MEX). Sri Petaling is served by two light rapid transit (LRT) stations, Bukit Jalil and Sri Petaling, on the Sri Petaling Line. Shopping By 2009, Sri Petaling had its own Carrefour hypermarket located in the Endah Parade Shopping Complex, the largest shopping complex in the area. Although Carrefour declared its intention to move from Sri Petaling in 2010, the hypermarket was bought over by the AEON Co. Ltd. in 2012 for RM990million. AEON Big is currently operating their hypermarket in the Endah Parade Shopping Complex. As of 2014 Endah Parade has grown to accommodate two gyms, a large spa & beauty centre, badminton courts, indoor futsal courts, car beauty studio, post office and a branch of the National Registration Department of Malaysia (Jabatan Pendaftaran Negara). Another shopping complex, The Store Hypermarket, is located near the town centre, serving Zones G, J and H of Sri Petaling. In early 2013 the first phase of new shops (Zone J) were completed by I&P; Group the sole developer of the area along Jalan Radin Bagus. As of March 2014, the final phase of shops surrounding The Store Hypermarket was completed. At present, many mini markets and a multitude of new cafes have popped up in the district, making the town lively, safe and family-friendly.

Notable sales include brands from Crocs, FitFlop, Levis, Adidas, Puma, Nike, Guardian Pharmacy, Anakku and many more. Healthcare The IMU Healthcare clinics, part of the International Medical University, in Bukit Jalil, is approximately 7 minutes from the farthest corner of the township. It is one of the few clinics in Malaysia to offer traditional Chinese medicine along with Western medicine, chiropractic and dentistry. A dialysis centre run by IMU Healthcare is also located in the town centre. There is a 24-hour clinic along Jalan Radin Anum, located along the same row of shops with a Pizza Hut, and two other clinics in the town. The town also has four chain pharmacies. Safety This area is the home of the Brickfields District Police Headquarters (Ibu Pejabat Polis Daerah Brickfields) of the Royal Malaysian Police, which was built in 2009. However, theft does not rest and occasionally there are break-ins. Homeowners in Zone N started to cordon off their housing area with private security guards and fences in early 2004, and this has created a ripple effect to neighbouring housing Zones P & L. Housing Sri Petaling has more than 5,900 units of houses. In 2009, its commercial three and four-story office blocks with a built-up area of 5,096 sq. ft. to 14,701 sq. ft. were priced from RM1.5-3 million. As of 2014, They are priced between RM4-8 million. Residential properties benefited from such a boom as well; houses in 2009 priced between RM300,000 to RM1.6 million, priced in 2014 between RM700,000k to RM4.8 million. Large apartment buildings of condominium types have been built; these include Endah Villa, Endah Regal, Endah Puri and Endah Ria apartments. Education Sri Petaling has many kindergartens, primary schools and two secondary schools. In addition, Sri Petaling has a music school, an art centre, a dance school, a yoga centre and a language centre. The International Medical University (IMU) is located in the neighbouring town of Bukit Jalil, 5 minutes from the town. =Primary schools= * SK Sri Saujana * SK Sri Petaling * SK Bandar Baru Petaling * SJK (C) La Salle =Secondary schools= * SMK Sri Saujana * SMK Bandar Baru Sri Petaling Amenities and nightlife There is a large mosque located near the centre of Sri Petaling which is usually packed with Muslim worshippers on Fridays and during the Islamic month of Ramadhan.

(81 kg), Buddin batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Turbeville, South Carolina. Early life Buddin played high school baseball in Olanta, South Carolina, where he led his team to the state championship in 1953. Buddin led The American Legion Baseball Olanta, Sc Post 85 to the State Championship game in 1951 He was a highly touted prospect, and the Boston Red Sox won a bidding war for his services. He was signed by Red Sox scout Mace Brown for an estimated $50,000 bonus. At the time, Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey boasted that \\"Buddin can become one of the top ballplayers of his time\\". He attended nearby Wofford College for two years and joined the Red Sox prior to the 1956 season. Major League career He became the Red Sox starting shortstop from 1956 through 1961, with the exception of the 1957 season, which he spent in military service. Buddin led the American League in errors by a shortstop in 1958 and 1959, and finished third and second in that category in 1956 and 1960. His defensive struggles led one Boston sportswriter to write that Buddin's car should bear the license plate \\"E-6,\\" and the nickname \\"Bootin' Buddin,\\" given by Red Sox fans. In 1959, the Red Sox bought infielder Pumpsie Green to compete for Buddin's job. With the promotion of Green, the Red Sox became the last team to integrate their roster. Buddin's most productive season came in 1961, when he batted a career-high .263 in 109 games. He was traded that offseason to the expansion Colt .45s for fellow shortstop Eddie Bressoud. Buddin was the starting shortstop in Houston's first official National League game on April 10, 1962 ‚Äî an 11‚Äì2 victory against the visiting Chicago Cubs, in which he was hitless in three at bats but played errorless ball in the field and turned a double play. On June 11, he hit the first grand slam in Houston franchise history against Joe Moeller of the Los Angeles Dodgers. But he batted only .163 in 40 games, and Bob Lillis supplanted him as the Colt .45s regular shortstop. On July 20, Buddin's contract was waived to the Tigers, where he played out his final year in the Majors as a backup to Chico Fern√°ndez. In a six-season MLB career, Buddin posted a .241 batting average with 551 hits and 41 home runs in 711 games, driving in 225 runs while scoring 342 times, committing 155 errors for a .954 fielding average. He also played seven minor league seasons between 1952 and 1965, most prominently in the International League and the Pacific Coast League circuits. Buddin died in Greenville, South Carolina, at the age of 77 after a long battle with cancer.

The technique for detecting the obturator sign, called the obturator test, is carried out on each leg in succession. The patient lies on her/his back with the hip and knee both flexed at ninety degrees. The examiner holds the patient's ankle with one hand and knee with the other hand. The examiner internally rotates the hip by moving the patient's ankle away from the patient's body while allowing the knee to move only inward. This is flexion and internal rotation of the hip. In the clinical context, it is performed when acute appendicitis is suspected. In this condition, the appendix becomes inflamed and enlarged. The appendix may come into physical contact with the obturator internus muscle, which will be stretched when this maneuver is performed on the right leg. This causes pain and is evidence in support of an inflamed appendix. The principles of the obturator sign in the diagnosis of appendicitis are similar to that of the psoas sign. The appendix is commonly located in the retrocecal or pelvic region. The obturator sign indicates the presence of an inflamed pelvic appendix. Evidence shows that the obturator test does not adequately diagnose appendicitis, but can be used in conjunction with other signs and symptoms to make a diagnosis.McGee, S. (2007).

It is situated in the town of Colmar-Berg, in central Luxembourg, near the confluence of the Alzette and the Attert, two of Luxembourg's most important rivers. History The estate at Colmar-Berg first came into the possession of the Grand Dukes of Luxembourg in 1845. The Belgian Revolution had divided Luxembourg from the Netherlands, and also into two, undermining Dutch control of the fortress of Luxembourg City. Grand Duke William II sought to establish a suitable Grand Ducal residence in Luxembourg, hoping that a division of his time between The Hague and Luxembourg would placate the local, overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, population. To this end, the Grand Duke bought Berg Castle from the Pasquier estate. In 1848, it was recognised as the exclusive home of the Grand Duke by the newly promulgated constitution. In 1890, the Royal house of the Netherlands and the Grand Ducal house of Luxembourg diverged, and the new Grand Duke, Adolphe, purchased Berg Castle the following year, in order to maintain the Grand Ducal estate at Colmar-Berg. In 1906, William IV had the old castle demolished and a new one constructed in its place, designed by the Munich-based architect Max Ostenrieder and the local Pierre Funck-Eydt. Work on the new castle began in 1907, and was completed on the 9th of september 1911, after which it became the primary residence of the Grand Ducal family. During the Great Depression, the Grand Ducal family fell upon hard times. Grand Duchess Charlotte sought an agreement with the government of Luxembourg under which the Grand Duchy might divest personal properties to the government, which would then allow the Grand Ducal family to use them as official residences. In 1934, such an arrangement was reached on Berg Castle, with the castle changing hands (along with much of the Gr√ºnewald forest). The two properties changed hands for 40m francs, of which 20m francs were denoted for the castle; this was viewed by the government as an undervaluation (as was the price of the Gr√ºnewald), as they had assessed the castle as being worth 22m francs. Berg is now one of two properties covered by similar agreements (the other being the Grand Ducal Palace in Luxembourg City). The right of Grand Dukes to reside at these two residences is enshrined in Article 44 of the Constitution of Luxembourg. During the Second World War, the castle was occupied by Nazi Germany. During this period, the most valuable works of art were stolen from the castle, and the building itself underwent major alterations to suit the Nazis' purpose of re-educating local girls. After the war, the restoration of the castle took several years, and it was only re-occupied by the Grand Ducal family in 1964, when Grand Duke Jean acceded to the throne. Until then, the Grand Duchess resided in Fischbach Castle, although this was mostly out of preference, rather than necessity. Births Three of the past four monarchs of Luxembourg were born at Berg Castle: * Grand Duchess Marie-Ad√©la√Øde (born 1894; reigned 1912‚Äì19) * Grand Duchess Charlotte (born 1896; reigned 1919‚Äì64) * Grand Duke Jean (born 1921; reigned 1964‚Äì2000) * Princess Marie Gabriele of Luxembourg (born 1925) The current Grand Duke, Henri, was born at Betzdorf Castle, in eastern Luxembourg.

The two sides contested the town of Ramadi in central Iraq, about 100 km (62 miles) west of Baghdad on the south bank of the Euphrates River, where an important Ottoman garrison was quartered. The town's strategic position on the road between Aleppo and Baghdad made it a key British target during the Mesopotamian campaign, but the hostile climatic conditions meant that it took two attacks over the course of three months for the town to fall. The first battle in July 1917 resulted in a British defeat. This was caused by a combination of factors, including extreme heat that caused more casualties than enemy fire, bad weather, faulty British communications, and an effective Turkish defence. The lessons learned were utilised in the second battle two months later: the British adopted different tactics and trapped the garrison against the Euphrates, cutting off their lines of escape. It was consequently captured almost in its entirety with large amounts of ammunition and supplies. First Battle of Ramadi =Background= In March 1917, the Ottoman Turks were driven out of Fallujah by the British and fell back to positions on the Madhij Defile, 29 km (18 miles) to the west. On their retreat they managed to breach the Sakhlawiya Dam on the Euphrates, significantly increasing the risk of flooding downriver. Although this had some tactical advantages for the British in that floodwaters would make the area west of Baghdad impassable, it also carried with it the risk ‚Äì which was deemed unacceptable ‚Äì that the Samarra and Musaiyib railways would be threatened and Fallujah cut off. The British therefore sought to reconstruct the dam. This required the occupation of Dhibban, a town about 32 km (20 miles) south of Ramadi, in order to guard the working parties on the dam. General Frederick Stanley Maude decided that an operation should be mounted to occupy Dhibban and strike against the Turkish garrison at Ramadi, which was said to number \\"about 120 sabres, 700 rifles and 6 [artillery] guns\\" ‚Äì in total about 1,000 men. Maude did not aim to occupy Ramadi but to drive out its garrison and capture as many prisoners and as much materiel as possible. Unexpectedly, however, the temperatures began to soar a few days after Maude issued his orders. By 8 July the temperature had reached over 50¬∞C (123¬∞F) in the shade in Baghdad and was several degrees higher in tents and dug-outs. The temperature in the direct sun was measured at 71¬∞C (160¬∞F). One observer noted that the Baghdadis called it \\"the hottest season in the memory of man\\" and commented that the extreme heat made most things too hot even to touch: \\"The rim of a tumbler burnt one's hand in a tent. The dust and sand burn the soles of one's feet through one's boots.\\" Maude considered postponing the operation but was advised by General Alexander Cobbe to go ahead on the grounds that the weather was unlikely to get cooler and that all possible precautions were being taken to minimise the impact of the heat. A column was assembled at Fallujah consisting of the 7th (Ferozepore) Brigade, two cavalry squadrons, fourteen artillery pieces, four armoured cars and half a sapper and miner company. Three aircraft were also designated to support the force, which was led by Lt Col Charles Levenax Haldane. The biggest challenge facing the British was how to get the force to Ramadi, as the heat made it impossible to march there from Dhibban, even at night. It was decided to transport them in motor vehicles, ferrying them up to their attacking positions and hopefully delivering them in a fresh enough state to mount an attack. This marked the first serious effort to use motorised infantry in the Mesopotamian theatre. 127 Ford vans and lorries were employed to transport the men, 600 at a time, travelling by night and with tents to shelter against the sun during the daytime. Ice would also be carried to ensure that any cases of heatstroke could be treated immediately. =Course of the battle= Dhibban was occupied without a fight on the night of 7/8 July and the rest of the force arrived there from Falluja on 10 July. A small detachment remained behind to guard Dhibban while the rest pressed on to the Madhij Defile, 11 km (7 miles) to the west. They reached it in the late evening and occupied it without opposition, though Turkish rifle fire was encountered soon afterwards. At 01:00 on 11 July, the advance resumed to Mushaid Point, about 3.2 km (2 miles) east of Ramadi. The column did not reach it until 04:45 due to heavy sand along the route. As the force moved through gardens and farms on the outskirts of Ramadi, the Turks opened fire with six artillery guns, two machine guns, and numerous rifles. By this time, two of the three British aircraft had been forced down after they developed mechanical problems, due to the heat evaporating the water from their radiators. The armoured cars and infantry could make no progress in the face of artillery and machine-gun fire. The Turkish artillery proved far more accurate than expected, repeatedly disabling the British wireless communications. Reinforcements were sent up at 06:45 but could make no further progress. To make matters worse a dust storm began at 08:00 and continued for most of the rest of the day. British communications broke down and the storm prevented effective counter-battery fire. This in turn made it impossible for the British infantry to attack, as they faced an advance across nearly 1 km (1,000 yards) of open ground in searing heat. The heat also made it impossible to organise a withdrawal during the daytime, so the troops dug in and endured the conditions with water being supplied from the Euphrates. Suggestions that the Turks might be about to withdraw came to nothing and, at 03:15 the following day, the British commander decided to withdraw under the cover of darkness. Although the Turks did not attack the withdrawing British, around 1,500 pro-Turkish Arabs mounted an attack but were \\"beaten off and severely punished as soon as it got light.\\" They continued to mount sniping attacks against the British as they made their way back to Dhibban, which they reached at 21:30 on 13 July. =Casualties and aftermath= The battle had been a costly failure, exacerbated by the severe weather conditions and the unexpectedly strong Turkish resistance. The British suffered 566 casualties, of whom 321 ‚Äì over half ‚Äì were caused by the heat. Enemy fire thus accounted for less than half of the British casualties. Some men died of heat stroke, while others were reported to have died of thirst or gone mad. Second Battle of Ramadi =Background= The second, ultimately successful, British effort to take Ramadi was mounted in September 1917. By this time the Turks had assembled a joint Turco-German force called the Yilderim (\\"Thunderbolt\\") Army Group, under the command of the German General Erich von Falkenhayn. The aim was to mount an attack into Iraq, marching down the Euphrates via Hƒ´t and on to Baghdad. The threat never materialised, however, as the Germans were unable to complete the railway lines that were needed to support their troops in the field and the Yilderim Army Group was redirected to the Palestine front. The threat of the Yilderim Army Group spurred the British to make another attempt to take Ramadi. Control of the town was also sought in order to deny the Turks access to fresh produce from the area, which was illicitly smuggled out of the British-controlled areas, and cut the desert road to Karbala. In mid-September 1917, General Maude ordered General Harry Brooking, commander of the 15th Indian Division, to undertake the operation. The division joined Brigadier General A. W. Andrew's 50th Indian Brigade at Falluja and set up forward positions at Madhij, east of Ramadi, by 20 September. The Turks were dug in along a line of sand dunes known as the Muskaid Ridge, about 6.5 km (4 miles) to the west of Madhij. Their main defensive positions were about 1.5 km (1 mile) further west, just south of Ramadi itself. Brooking decided to mount a frontal attack from the south while using the 6th Indian Cavalry Brigade to cut off the garrison's line of retreat from the west. This would pin the Turks against the river, as there was no bridge at Ramadi. The Turks had assumed that the British would repeat the tactics they used in July and organised their defences accordingly to cover an arc running from the east to the south of the town. They expected to be able to use the road to the west to retreat if necessary. Since the July attack, the Turkish garrison had been substantially reinforced and now numbered 3,500 infantry, 500 artillery and 100 cavalry, with 10 artillery guns. Brooking carried out an elaborate series of false preparations to bolster the Turks' belief that the British would once again seek to advance along the banks of the Euphrates. A pontoon bridge was built at Madhij on 28 September, troops were encamped along the river, and friendly Arab tribes were recruited to move supplies to the riverbank opposite Ramadi. Brooking's order to commence the attack was also deliberately vague, so as to conceal the true plan of attack from any Turkish spies in Madhij. =Course of the battle= At 21:45 on the night of 27 September, the infantry advance began with a march to the Mushaid Ridge, which they occupied with little opposition. Instead of continuing along the river bank, however, the 12th and 42nd Indian Brigades swung left to the Euphrates Valley Canal between the Euphrates and Lake Habbaniyah. They secured the dam across the canal by 15:00 on 28 September. Their advance in the intense heat was made possible by a water supply chain that Brooking had established using 350 Ford vans, which transported over 63,000 litres (14,000 gallons) of water on 28 September alone. Meanwhile, the 6th Cavalry Brigade had ridden across the desert to the south and west of Ramadi and reached the road 8 km (5 miles) west of the town by 16:00, where they dug in to block any Turkish retreat. With artillery support, British forces advanced up two ridges to the south of Ramadi in the face of Turkish machine gun, rifle and artillery fire. Both were taken by the early afternoon of 28 September. The garrison's last escape route was now the Aziziya Bridge just to the west of Ramadi and, as the battle continued into the night under bright moonlight, a column of Turkish infantry sought to fight its way out of the trap at 03:00 on 29 September. Heavy British machine gun and artillery fire repelled them and drove the survivors back to Ramadi after an hour and half of fighting. The 39th Garhwal Rifles attacked the bridge, charging Turkish guns firing over open sights, and took it by 07:30 despite suffering heavy casualties; only 100 men from the three assaulting companies made it through. The Garhwali advance convinced the Turkish defenders that the battle was lost. At 09:15, large numbers of Turks began surrendering to the Garhwalis at the bridge; by 09:30, as the rest of the British force advanced towards the mud walls of Ramadi, \\"white flags went up all along the enemy's line\\". By 11:00 the Turkish commander, Ahmed Bey, and the rest of the garrison had surrendered. The Turkish surrender came just in time, as a powerful sandstorm began shortly afterwards which reduced visibility to a few metres; had it struck earlier, the garrison could easily have slipped away. =Casualties and aftermath= 120 Turkish troops were killed in the battle and another 190 were wounded. 3,456 prisoners were captured by the British, including 145 officers. Of the garrison, a handful escaped by swimming the Euphrates. British casualties numbered 995, though many of these had been only slightly wounded due to the Turkish shrapnel bursting too high to be of much effect. A great deal of materiel was seized, including 13 artillery pieces, 12 machine guns and large quantities of ammunition and other supplies. The capture of Ramadi also led to the local Arab tribes switching sides and supporting the British. Maude later called the action \\"an instance of as clean and business-like a military operation as one could wish to see.\\" The fall of the town was so sudden that on the day after the battle a German pilot attempted to land at Ramadi before he realised who now occupied it and made a hasty escape. The town was deemed sufficiently secure that on the following day, the British decided to continue their advance to assault Hƒ´t, the next major Turkish-held town on the Euphrates.

It may be performed with both feet on the ground, or with one leg raised straight up. Etymology and origins The name of this pose comes from Sanskrit ‡§µ‡§ø‡§™‡§∞‡•Ä‡§§ viparƒ´ta, \\"inverted\\", ‡§¶‡§£‡•ç‡§° da·πá·∏ça, \\"staff\\" symbolising authority and the devotee's prostration, and ‡§Ü‡§∏‡§® ƒÅsana, \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". The variants are named for Sanskrit ‡§è‡§ï eka, \\"one\\" or ‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø dvi, \\"two\\", and ‡§™‡§æ‡§¶ pada, \\"foot\\". The pose is not found in medieval Hatha yoga texts. It is described in the 20th century by two of Krishnamacharya's pupils, Pattabhi Jois in his Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, and B. K. S. Iyengar in his Light on Yoga. Description The pose is entered from lying on the back. The hands and feet are positioned close to the body as for upwards bow, and the body is lifted so the crown of the head can be rested on the floor. The legs are then straightened into the two-legged pose, Dvi Pada Viparƒ´ta Da·πá·∏çƒÅsana, and the hands are arranged holding the head as for yoga headstand (Sirsasana). Alternatively, advanced students can enter the pose from Sirsasana, arching the back, lowering the legs to the floor, and then straightening the legs. The one-legged pose, Eka Pada Viparƒ´ta Da·πá·∏çƒÅsana, can then be entered by raising one leg; the leg is held stretched straight out vertically. Advanced students can leave the pose by returning to Sirsasana. This pose is in the Advanced A Series of Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga. Variations Eka Pada Viparita Dandasana The pose can be practised on an open-backed chair, its seat padded with a folded blanket. The pose is entered by sitting with the feet through the back of the chair, holding the chair's back, and leaning back into a reclining position with the back supported on the seat of the chair. A bolster or folded blankets may be used to support the head and relax the body if the neck feels compressed. A more strenuous pose for advanced students is Viparita Dandasana II, where the feet are brought towards the head until the ankles are grasped by the hands; the head is lifted. A variant of that is Eka Pada Viparita Dandasana II, with one leg lifted to point straight up.  Claims  Twentieth century advocates of some schools of yoga, such as B. K. S. Iyengar, made claims for the effects of yoga on specific organs, without adducing any evidence. Iyengar claimed that this pose kept \\"the spine sound and healthy while the chest expands fully.\\"  Cautions  The pose is not advised for those with spinal injuries or high blood pressure.

He served in the American Civil War, distinguishing himself during the Battle of Gettysburg, and took part in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. He pursued a civil engineering career in a peacetime and became in 1893 the first head of the Office of Road Inquiry, which was the Federal Highway Administration's predecessor.Richard F. Weingroff. The Federal Highway Administration at 100, Public Roads, No. 2, Vol. 57, Autumn 1993 Early life and family Stone was born in Plattsburgh, New York, to Ithiel V. and Sarah Stone. His family had been among the early settlers of the region, and his father owned a large estate. As a young man, he was an engineer and lumberman before the Civil War. Stone married Mary Elizabeth Marker at the First Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh on August 14, 1862. They would have two children, a son, Richmond and a daughter, Margaret. Civil War Stone served as a Union Army officer during the Civil War and became noted for his stubborn defense of the McPherson Farm during the Battle of Gettysburg. He first served as major of the 13th Pennsylvania Reserves, a regiment that saw action at several early war battles, including Antietam. Stone returned to Pennsylvania to help recruit new regiments; he was commissioned as colonel of the newly raised 149th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry in 1863. He commanded a brigade in the third division of I Corps of the Army of the Potomac in the Battle of Chancellorsville but did not see serious combat. During the Gettysburg Campaign, Stone retained command of his three Pennsylvania regiments. Confederate troops attack the McPherson Farm On July 1, 1863, on the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg, his brigade, largely composed of green troops, was posted on McPherson's Ridge south of the Chambersburg Pike. Although the brigade had not seen previous combat, it was instrumental in holding back several assaults by the Confederates. Stone moved his regiments to block attacks by Colonel John Brockenborough and Brigadier General Junius Daniel. His troops held until the Iron Brigade and other Federal units fell back.Pfanz, Harry W. Gettysburg‚ÄîThe First Day. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2001. Stone's men were among last to withdraw from their sector. Stone was severely wounded in the hip and arm in the fighting, and he returned home to recuperate.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher. Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001, p. 514. After his return to active duty, Stone served briefly as a brigade commander in James Wadsworth's 4th Division, V Corps during Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's 1864 Overland Campaign. He was removed from command during the Battle of the Wilderness. Stone's horse fell on him on May 5, but many presumed he had been drunk on the battlefield.Rhea, Gordon C. The Battle of the Wilderness May 5‚Äì6, 1864.

Everett is currently Trustee Professor of Cognitive Sciences at Bentley University in Waltham, Massachusetts. From July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2018 Everett served as Dean of Arts and Sciences at Bentley. Prior to Bentley University, Everett was Chair of the Department of Languages, Literatures and Cultures at Illinois State University in Normal, Illinois. He has taught at the University of Manchester and the University of Campinas and is former Chair of the Linguistics Department of the University of Pittsburgh.  Early life  Everett was raised near the Mexican border in Holtville, California. His father was an occasional cowboy, mechanic, and construction worker. His mother was a waitress at a local restaurant. Everett played in rock bands from the time he was 11 years old until converting to Christianity at age 17, after meeting missionaries Al and Sue Graham in San Diego, California. At age 18 Everett married the daughter of these missionaries, Keren. He completed a diploma in Foreign Missions from the Moody Bible Institute of Chicago in 1975. Daniel and Keren Everett subsequently enrolled in the Summer Institute of Linguistics (now SIL International), which trains missionaries in field linguistics so that they can translate the Bible into various world languages. Because Everett, by his own account, quickly demonstrated a gift for language, he was invited to study Pirah√£, which previous SIL missionaries had, according to Everett, failed to learn in 20 years of study. In 1977, after four months of jungle training and three semesters of courses in linguistic analysis, translation principles, and literacy development, the couple and their three children moved to Brazil, where they studied Portuguese for a year before moving to a Pirah√£ village at the mouth of the Maici River in the Lowland Amazonia region. Since 1999, Everett's stays in the jungle have notoriously included a generator-powered freezer (which according to Everett is well stocked with ice cream), and a large video and DVD collection. Says Everett, \\"After twenty years of living like a Pirah√£, I‚Äôd had it with roughing it.\\" Everett's first marriage to Keren Graham lasted 35 years and they had three children: Caleb Everett (associate professor of anthropology, University of Miami); Kristene Diggins (a doctor of nursing practice in Charlotte, North Carolina); and Shannon Russell (a missionary with Jungle Aviation and Radio Service (JAARS), along with her husband).  Education in linguistics  Everett had some initial success learning the language, but when SIL lost their contract with the Brazilian government, he enrolled in the fall of 1978 at the University of Campinas in Brazil, under the auspices of which he could continue to study Pirah√£. Everett focused on the theories of Noam Chomsky. His master's thesis, Aspectos da Fonologia do Pirah√£, was written under the direction of Dr. Aryon Rodrigues, one of the leading experts on Amazonian languages. It was completed in 1980. His PhD dissertation, A Lingua Pirah√£ e Teoria da Sintaxe, completed in 1983, was written under the direction of Dr. Charlotte Chamberlland Galves. This dissertation provided a detailed Chomskyan analysis of Pirah√£. On one of his research missions in 1993, Everett was the first to document the Oro Win language, one of the few languages in the world to use the rare voiceless dental bilabially trilled affricate (phonetically, ).  Work  = Amazonian and other American languages = Everett has conducted field research on many Amazonian languages, focusing on their phonetics (sound production), phonology (sound structures), morphology (word structures), syntax (sentence structures), discourse structures and content (how people communicate culturally relevant information by stories), pragmatics (how language is constrained by some social settings), ethnolinguistics (how culture affects linguistic forms), historical linguistics (the reconstruction of the origin and dispersion of languages by comparing data from other languages), among other areas. He has published a grammar of the Wari' language (with Barbara Kern), a grammar of Pirah√£, and grammar sketches of other languages. = Aspectos da Fonologia do Pirah√£ = Everett's 1979 Universidade Estadual de Campinas master's thesis on the sound system of Piraha, from articulatory phonetics to prosody (e.g. intonation, tone, and stress placement). = A L√≠ngua Pirah√£ e a Teoria da Sintaxe = This was Everett's 1983 Sc.D. dissertation at the Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP) and is still the most comprehensive statement of Pirah√£ grammar available. Everett has revised many of his analyses of the language in the intervening years and is planning a much more comprehensive grammar with detailed discourse studies in the coming years. = Wari': The Pacaas-Novos Language of Western Brazil = This 540-page grammar of the Wari' language was a ten-year project that was undertaken by Everett and New Tribes Missionary, Barbara Kern, who has worked among the Wari' since 1962 and is perhaps the most fluent non-Wari' speaker of the language. = Universal grammar = Everett eventually concluded that Chomsky's ideas about universal grammar, and the universality of recursion in particular, are falsified by Pirah√£. His 2005 article in Current Anthropology, entitled \\"Cultural Constraints on Grammar and Cognition in Pirah√£\\",Daniel Everett, \\"Cultural Constraints on Grammar and Cognition in Pirah√£\\", Current Anthropology, volume 46, number 4, August‚ÄìOctober 2005, pp. 621‚Äì46. has caused a controversy in the field of linguistics.Robin H. Ray, \\"Linguists doubt exception to universal grammar\\", MIT News, April 23, 2007. Though a supporter of Everett in the early part of Everett's career, Chomsky refuses to further discuss Everett's works and has called him a charlatan.Folha de S.Paulo , 1 February 2009. The June 2009 issue of the Journal of the Linguistic Society of America, Language, contains a nearly 100-page debate between Everett and some of his principal critics. = Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle = In November 2008, Everett's book on the culture and language of the Pirah√£ people, and what it was like to live among them, was published in the United Kingdom by Profile Books and in the United States by Pantheon Books. Blackwell's booksellers in the UK selected this as one of the best books of 2009 in the UK. National Public Radio selected it as one of the best books of 2009 in the US. Translations have appeared in German, French, and Korean, and others are due to appear in 2010 in Thai, and Mandarin. Although the book has been discussed widely on the internet for the chapter that discusses his abandonment of religious faith, it is mainly about doing scientific field research and the discoveries that this has led to about the grammar and culture of the Pirah√£ people. Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes was runner-up for the 2008 award for adult non-fiction from the Society of Midland Authors. = Language: The Cultural Tool = This book develops an alternative to the view that language is innate. It argues that language is, like the bow and arrow, a tool to solve a common human problem, the need to communicate efficiently and effectively. = Dark Matter of the Mind: The Culturally Articulated Unconscious = In this book, published by the University of Chicago Press, Everett reviews a great deal of philosophy, anthropology, linguistics, and cognitive science to argue that humans are molded by culture and that the idea of human nature is not a very good fit with the facts. He reiterates and supports Aristotle's claim that the mind is a blank slate and makes the case that the notion of the human self most compatible with the facts is the Buddhist concept of anƒÅtman. = How Language Began: The Story of Humanity's Greatest Invention = In this work, Everett makes the case that Homo erectus invented language nearly two million years ago and that the subsequent species Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens were born into a linguistic world.  Religious beliefs  Influenced by the Pirah√£'s concept of truth, Everett's belief in Christianity slowly diminished and he became an atheist. He says that he was having serious doubts by 1982 and had abandoned all faith by 1985. He would not tell anyone about his atheism until the late '90s; when he finally did, his marriage ended in divorce and two of his three children broke off all contact. However, by 2008 full contact and relations have been restored with his children, who now seem to accept his viewpoint on theism.

It has been historically one of the most fashionable streets in Saint Petersburg, and in the 19th century was called by the French term, Promenade des Anglais. It was from the English Embankment that at 2 AM on October 25, 1917, the gunshot from the Aurora sent the signal to storm the Winter Palace during Russian Revolution. The English Embankment runs perpendicular to the south end of the Annunciation Bridge and spans between the Novo-Admiralteysky Canal and the Decembrists Square, where it becomes the Admiralty Embankment. History The English Embankment with the Senate and Synod buildings, view from Vasilievsky Island Angliyskaya Embankment at the end of the 19th century =The British Embassy and church= The English Embankment was built between 1763 and 1767. It is named after the former British Embassy and the English church that was located at No56, the building is now occupied by the Travel and Sightseeing Bureau. The English church was built in 1814 and 1815 to a design by Giacomo Quarenghi, it is preserved as architectural landmark. The interior of the English church is highlighted with marble, historic paintings, and boasts a large pipe organ - the only English organ existing in Russia. The last British Ambassador left in 1918, after the Russian Revolution. =Battleship Aurora during the revolution= Next to the Annunciation Bridge is a monument commemorating the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. From this historic spot, at 2 AM on October 25, 1917, the gunshot from the Aurora sent the signal to storm the Winter Palace. The symbolism of the name \\"Aurora\\" was its meaning as \\"the dawn of a new era\\" in history. This historic spot has been since a traditional location for a swear-in ceremony for new members of the Pioneers and the Komsomol organisations. =Annual appearance of the \\"Scarlet Sails\\"= Another historic tradition that started at the English Embankment in St. Petersburg has been the popular appearance of a boat with \\"Scarlet Sails\\" (). This tradition began here after the end of the Second World War, when schools united to celebrate the ending of a school year in connection with symbolism of the popular children's book Scarlet Sails by Alexander Grin. At that time a boat with scarlet sails was sailing along the English Embankment and the Admiralty Embankment towards the Winter Palace. Although it was designed to update the rusty revolutionary propaganda, the \\"Scarlet Sails\\" tradition has become a popular public event ever since, celebrating the annual ending of school year in June. The \\"Scarlet sails\\" appearance is now part of the White Nights celebration.YouTube: \\"Scarlet Sails\\" celebration in St. Petersburg Today One of the most prestigious locations in St. Petersburg, the English Embankment today is mostly home to corporate offices located in former palatial houses of imperial Russian nobility and pre-revolutionary foreign embassies. It is a very popular sightseeing destination among tourists because of the view of the Neva and palaces across the river. The Menshikov Palace and the Academy of Arts building on the Vasilevsky Island across the river. Many boat tours start at the embankment, taking tourists on a journey about canals and bridges of St. Petersburg. The Constitutional Court of Russia is scheduled to move to the former Senate and Synod buildings at the Decembrists Square and English Embankment in St. Petersburg by 2008. The move will partially restore Saint Petersburg's historic status, making the city the second judicial capital.

Although dependent upon his earnings, he was so unselfish and considerate that, in order to avoid embarrassing the poor among his patients, he would never accept pay directly from any one, but instead attached to a certain part of his house a box in which each might place what he pleased. According to the story, Abaye, 280 -339, the great Talmudic authority of the time, sent two young disciples to test him. Having lodged with him they took in the morning the bedding on which they had slept and went to the market. When Abba passed by they asked him to estimate the bedding's worth. He quoted them a price and, being asked whether the value might be higher, he said: this is what I paid for it. Then they told him that indeed they had taken the bedding from him and asked what he suspected them of. He explained that he had thought that they needed the money urgently for charity‚Äîthe redemption of prisoners‚Äîand were too shy to ask him. Being offered to take back his property he refused, saying that he had already dedicated it for charity.

Background The song has its origin in a political campaign launched by the government in 1974 with a slogan \\"Argentina potencia\\" (\\"Argentina power\\") and a song called \\"Contagiate Mi Alegr√≠a\\" written by Fernando Sustaita and Ernesto Olivera. Fans of football clubs such as Boca Juniors adapted the song as football chants, and it was then turned into \\"Vamos, vamos, Argentina\\" with different lyrics. The song was recorded for the 1978 World Cup held in Argentina, and became highly popular. =Legal disputes= The attribution of the song became a tangled issue as Sustaita and Olivera were not credited as the songwriters in the released recordings, instead in some versions the authors were credited as Nemara (N√©stor Rama) and Rimasi, in others Rama and Julio Fontana, while Juan Carlos Zaraik Goulu and N√©stor Rama were registered as the authors of the song. Sustaita and Olivera then complained of plagiarism, and a settlement was reached whereby Sustaita was given the credit as composer, with Olivera and Zaraik Goulu the lyricists. The issue was further complicated by the existence of a different song written by Enrique N√∫√±ez and Roque Mellace in 1977 that has the same title of \\"Vamos, vamos, Argentina\\". N√∫√±ez and Mellace claimed royalties for the song despite the two songs being entirely different apart from the first two lines (Vamos, vamos Argentina / vamos, vamos a ganar). In August 2007, the civil court controversially found in favour of N√∫√±ez and Mellace and ordered that royalties be paid to the pair. Lyrics In Spanish: English translation: The adjective quilombera used in the third line is a mildly obscene term. In the lunfardo argot, quilombo means brothel; the word is used by Argentines (when profanity is tolerated) to mean \\"bedlam\\" or \\"mess\\". In this case, quilombera is used to describe the fact that football fans make a lot of noise and usually a mess of throwing confetti when goals are scored.

He was a founder of the city of Newport, Kentucky. Early life General James Taylor Mansion, Newport, Kentucky Taylor was the fifth child born to James Taylor IV and his wife, Anne Hubbard Taylor in Midway, Virginia. His father, James Taylor IV, bought of land in Northern Kentucky from his friend George Muse, which was part of the land Muse had been awarded for his military service in the French and Indian War. The Taylor family had two cousins, James Madison and Zachary Taylor, who later become presidents of the United States. Newport development On April 1, 1792, just short of his 23rd birthday, James Taylor V left his father's plantation for Kentucky accompanied by three slaves, Moses, Humphrey and Adam, along with an English Army deserter, Robert Christy, and Christy's wife and their three children. They reached Newport June 20 but couldn't find lodging, so he stayed at Fort Washington in Cincinnati. His enslaved men worked through the summer to clear in fields along the Licking River, plant two corn crops, and build a small cabin on lot no. 6 at the southwest corner of Second Street and Central Avenue. James Taylor V became the driving force behind the settlement's development. He laid out the first road to Lexington in August with Jacob and Edward Fowler. In 1794 James Taylor tapped his connections with Kentucky's leaders to lobby at Frankfort for acts incorporating Newport and creating Campbell County, Kentucky. The legislature established the county on December 17, 1794 from parts of Mason, Scott and Harrison Counties. On December 14, 1795 it approved Newport's charter. James Taylor V and Keturah Moss Leitch were married on November 15, 1795. They had 11 children, but only four survived to maturity. In 1803, James Taylor V solicited the help of his cousin, James Madison, who was then U.S. Secretary of State, to persuade the federal government to move the Ft. Washington military post from Cincinnati to Newport. The Newport Barracks replaced Fort Washington across the river in Cincinnati, Ohio. There were but in the original tract, which was bought from the old Colonel Taylor estate for the minimal price if $1. In 1806, two additional acres were bought for $47. Taylor was hired as the superintendent of the construction of the barracks. He was to erect three buildings. Gen. James Taylor V was Quartermaster General and paymaster of the Northwestern Army during the War of 1812, thus Newport became a vital center for war supplies. Death and legacy During a storied lifetime, James Taylor V operated ferries across both the Ohio and Licking rivers, helped to found banks, invested in the mammoth Newport Manufacturing Co., operated saw and grist mills along the Licking River, was part owner of a salt-works at Grants Lick, Ky., ran a tanning business and in his spare time was known to collect fossils and hunt buffalo at Big Bone Lick in Boone County. James Taylor V and his wife were members of St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Newport, on the Courthouse Square. He and his wife Keturah were laid to rest at the Taylor Family Plot Evergreen Cemetery, Southgate, Ky. At his death, James Taylor V was said to be one of the wealthiest men in the state of Kentucky, with an estate valued at more than $4 million. In the mid-19th century, Newport became a hub for trade, industry and culture. Just a few years later, Gen. Taylor's grandson established the wealthy area of East Row, a collection of elegant homes. Today, the East Row local Historic District is the second largest local district in Kentucky and the Taylor Mansion is the district's oldest house. Taylor is the namesake of the General James Taylor Park. Bellevue (the Taylor mansion) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 22, 1976.

It is used in photographic processing as an intensifier and as a brominating agent in organic synthesis. It is also used in the copper vapor laser, a class of laser where the medium is copper bromide vapour formed in-situ from hydrogen bromide reacting with the copper discharge tube. Producing yellow or green light, it is used in dermatological applications. Synthesis Copper(II) bromide can be obtained by combining copper oxide and hydrobromic acid: :CuO + 2HBr ‚Üí CuBr2 \\\\+ H2O. Purification Copper(II) bromide is purified by crystallization twice from water, filtration to remove any CuBr and concentration under vacuum. This product is dehydrated using phosphorus pentoxide.Hope et al. J Chem Soc 5226 1960, Glemser & Sauer in Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry (Ed.Brauer) Academic Press Vol II p 1009 1965. Molecular and crystal structure In the solid state CuBr2 has a polymeric structure, with CuBr4 planar units connected on opposite sides to form chains. The crystal structure is monoclinic, space group C2/m, with lattice constants a = 714 pm, b = 346 pm, c = 718 pm, e √ü = 121¬∞ 15'. CuBr2 monomeric units are present in the gas phase at high temperature..It forms bright green-blue solutions in water,and reacts with Aluminium exothermically:3CuBr2+2Al forms 2AlBr3 and 3Cu Reactions Copper (II) bromide in chloroform-ethyl acetate reacts with ketones resulting in the formation of alpha-bromo ketones. The resulting product can be directly used for the preparation of derivatives. This heterogeneous method is reported to be the most selective and direct method of formation of Œ±-bromo ketones. Dibromination of NPGs, n-pentenyl glycosides, using CuBr2/LiBr reagent combination was performed in order for an NPG to serve as a glycosyl acceptor during halonium-promoted couplings. Such reaction gives high yield of the dibromides from alkenyl sugars that are resistant to a direct reaction with molecular bromine.

It contains the remnants of 4,412 Polish officers of the Kozelsk prisoner of war camp, who were murdered in 1940 in what is called the Katyn massacre. Except for bodies of two Polish generals exhumed by German authorities in 1943 and then buried separately, all Polish officers murdered in Katyn were buried in six large mass graves. There is also a Russian part of the cemetery, where some 6,500 victims of the Soviet Great Purges of the 1930s were buried by the NKVD.Official site of Katyn memorial The cemetery was officially opened in 2000. The cemetery is a large, irregular area covering roughly 22 hectares of forest. All mass graves are located on both sides of the main alley. There is also a circular alley with thousands of names of the officers who perished in the massacre. At the end of the main alley there is a war memorial and an altar with a memorial bell located underground. History Initially, after the exhumation of 1943, the Germans had permitted the Polish Red Cross to build a cemetery on the spot. However, following the Soviet re-taking of the area it was destroyed and most evidence removed. The area was again forested and civilians were banned from entering the area. As the knowledge of the massacre was suppressed in Communist countries, in 1976 the Polish Government in Exile awarded the Katyn Memorial in London with the cross of Virtuti Militari, the highest Polish military award. Following Soviet admittance of the crime in 1990, the exhumation and archaeological works were resumed. In 1994 a bi-lateral treaty on war cemeteries and war memorials was concluded between Poland and Russia. This paved the way for a construction of a proper war cemetery in Katyn. After several years of construction it was opened to the public on July 28, 2000. That year also similar cemeteries were opened at other mass murder sites of Piatikhatki (near Kharkiv), Smolensk, and Mednoye. The Virtuti Militari awarded to the monument in London was then transferred to Katyn, which became one of the very few places in the world among its recipients. During the opening ceremony the spot was visited by the highest Polish and Russian authorities. Among them were the Prime Ministers Jerzy Buzek and Viktor Khristenko, as well as Marshals of Sejm (Maciej P≈Ça≈ºy≈Ñski) and Senate (Alicja Grze≈õkowiak). The ceremony was opened by the Polish Chief of General Staff, General , and concluded with a Catholic mass celebrated by the primate of Poland J√≥zef Glemp, while the Orthodox ceremony was conducted by Metropolitan bishop of Smolensk Cyril Gundyaev. There were also prayers of other denominations held, as there were also Protestant, Muslim and Jewish victims of the NKVD buried there. On April 10, 2010, the Polish President Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, his wife and another 94 people including many of his top staff members, more than a dozen members of the Parliament and leaders of the military died when the presidential plane went down about a half mile from the runway in the Russian city of Smolensk. The Polish delegation was on its way to take part in a ceremony there to commemorate the Soviet massacre of more than 20,000 members of Poland‚Äôs elite 70 years ago.

It was one of the two main American family housing areas in the United States Army Garrison Heidelberg that provided quarters for American military personnel, authorized civilian employees, and their families (the other being Patrick Henry Village). MTV is located adjacent to Campbell Barracks, which served as the home to the Headquarters of United States Army Europe (USAREUR), the Headquarters for NATO's Allied Land Forces Central Europe (LANDCENT), and the Installation Management Command Europe Region (IMCOM-E). MTV is separated by a main thoroughfare. Located within the housing area was an Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) shoppette, a library, a chapel, the Mark Twain Elementary School, and the Heidelberg High School, which both served American military dependent children living in the surrounding area. The high school served students from Mark Twain Village, nearby Patrick Henry Village, and their respective surrounding areas. Heidelberg High was one of the largest DoDDS schools in Germany. It, along with all the other schools in the Heidelberg area, was closed in 2013. Most of MTV's housing area has been shut down (the area across the street from Campbell Barracks) and given back to the City of Heidelberg. Because the closed area had severed access from Campbell Barracks, the decision was made that this would be the first portion returned to the City of Heidelberg. It is currently being renovated with some buildings already accommodating German civilians. Another part of MTV's housing area is now being used by NATO personnel. For most of its existence, MTV was indistinguishable from the surrounding public residential buildings and was not fenced, gated, or otherwise closed to the general public until 2003, when a fence was installed around MTV and all other United States Army installations in Heidelberg. There was a requirement to show ID to enter the area. The entire compound, along with Campbell Barracks, was gated and required United States military ID to enter.

It was published in 1955. An English translation by Ann Goldstein appeared in 2016; she renders the title as The Street Kids. Earlier translations called it The Ragazzi or The Hustlers. Plot The novel tells the story of Riccetto, a street urchin to whom the audience is first introduced during his Confirmation and First Communion. Not too long afterwards, Riccetto is stealing from a blind beggar and a convent. Over the next few years, the reader follows along with Riccetto as he goes from robbery to scam to prostituting himself and back again while drifting around. During this time, many of his companions are killed or die off and there is constant immorality at hand. He is finally arrested and put in jail after trying to steal some iron in order to buy his fianc√©e an engagement ring. He is released afterwards and goes back to his same street life. Pasolini makes it clear to the reader that Riccetto and his peers are wanderers by nature, they have no life plans or goals and don't care to; Riccetto is a more deviant Dean Moriarty of sorts. This is the way in which Pasolini finds this subclass of people to be free from modernity and rooted in a way of life that has since been lost. He also admired \\"what he considered their pre-political rebelliousness\\";Sillanpoa, 122 they were separated from the partisan politics that plagued post-war modern Italy. Composition Pasolini wished to bring to the attention of the public the existence of this underground class they thought extinct. As he saw it, \\"They were thought of as a closed book. Yet, poor devils, they really did exist\\".Ward, 59 He wrote the book in lowbrow language and derogatory slang that the real life \\"lumpen proletariat\\" would use. It made the book difficult for mainstream readers, the reading public that Pasolini opposed. He later wrote in Heretical Empiricism that literature should be \\"written in a language substantially different from that of the writer, not leaving out of consideration a certain naturalism\\".Heretical Empiricism, p. 89 Another alienating characteristic of the book is the fact that the narrator does not provide any background information for readers unfamiliar with the social setting of his story. His narration puts himself on the same level as his characters. He does not narrate from above.Ward, 64 He saw the underground class as the only ones who survived the corruption brought about of industrialization and modernity, a sort of human time capsule, the only ones who are truly free. He respects them for this and sees them as the true underclass that even the Communist Party looks down on. Significance Ragazzi di vita parallels some of Pasolini's films like Mamma Roma and La Ricotta in developing his own form of neo-realism, separate from that of Roberto Rossellini and other post-war directors. Pasolini carried neo-realism further creating a sort of \\"hyper-realism\\". While Rossellini highlights the lives of the common man, Pasolini seeks to highlight the lives of the sub- common man. Ragazzi di Vita is a milestone for the development of Pasolini's passion for this genre. Public reception The novel was criticized among the general public (as were many of his films) upon its release and was heavily censored. The government led by the Christian Democracats condemned its \\"obscenity\\".Friedrich, 15 The communists did not approve of the book, as well, charging it with \\"artificiality, an absence of positive heroes, and, especially, a lack of 'perspective.Friedrich, 14 References ;Sources *Freidrich, Pia.

It is a political thriller about the son of a prominent U.S. political family who is brainwashed into being an unwitting assassin for a Communist conspiracy. The novel has been adapted twice into a feature film with the same title, in 1962 and again in 2004. The 1962 film is faithful to the book; the 2004 remake updates the action and alters characters. Plot summary Major Bennett Marco, Sergeant Raymond Shaw, and the rest of their infantry platoon are captured by an elite Soviet commando unit during the Korean War in 1952. They are taken to Manchuria, and brainwashed into believing Shaw saved their lives in combat ‚Äì for which Shaw is subsequently awarded the Medal of Honor. Years after the war, Marco, now back in the United States working as an intelligence officer, begins suffering a recurring nightmare. In the dreams that Major Marco was experiencing, the platoon were all together surrounded by what appeared to be sweet little old ladies, a part of their brainwashing. The platoon was seated together and one of the ladies tells Sergeant Shaw to murder two of his comrades from his platoon. The backdrop with the old ladies changes back and forth between them and Chinese and Soviet intelligence officials. When Marco learns that another soldier from the platoon has been suffering the same nightmare, he investigates why this is happening. Major Marco looks up Sergeant Raymond Shaw and discovers that Shaw's new manservant is someone that he recognizes from Korea. They start fighting in Shaw's house and both get bloodied significantly. Marco is arrested, and when Shaw sees that it is his old Major, they rekindle their relationship. Both find love interests; for Marco, it is Rose Cheyney, and for Raymond, it is Jocelyn Jordan, the daughter of Senator Thomas Jordan, who is a neighbor of Shaw's. Senator Jordan and Shaw's mother do not like each other, but Raymond continues to see Jocelyn. It is revealed that the Communists have been using Shaw as a sleeper agent who, activated by a posthypnotic trigger, immediately forgets the assignments he carries out and therefore can never betray himself either purposely or inadvertently. In Shaw's case, the suggestion that he play solitaire is the trigger. Seeing the Queen of Diamonds playing card transforms him into an assassin who will kill anyone at whom he is directed. Shaw's KGB handler is his domineering mother, Eleanor. Married to McCarthy-esque Senator Johnny Iselin, Eleanor has convinced the Communist powers to help install her husband as president and allow them to control the American government through him. By observing Shaw, Marco discovers the trigger shortly before the national convention of Iselin's political party. He uses the Queen of Diamonds card to draw out Eleanor's plan: after she obtains the vice presidential nomination for Iselin, Shaw is to shoot the presidential candidate so that Iselin can succeed him. Blaming the killing on the Communists will enable Iselin to assume dictatorial powers. Marco reprograms Shaw, although it is unclear until the final pages whether this is successful. At the convention, Shaw instead shoots and kills his mother and Senator Iselin. Marco is the first person to reach Shaw's sniper nest, getting there just before Shaw turns the gun on himself.final page of The Manchurian Candidate Alleged plagiarism In 1998, software developer C. J. Silverio noted that several long passages of the novel seemed to be adapted from Robert Graves' 1934 novel I, Claudius. Forensic linguist John Olsson judged that \\"There can be no disputing that Richard Condon plagiarized from Robert Graves.\\" Olsson went on to state that \\"As plagiarists go, Condon is quite creative, he does not confine himself to one source and is prepared to throw other ingredients into the pot.\\" Jonathan Lethem, in his influential essay The Ecstasy of Influence: A Plagiarism, has identified The Manchurian Candidate as one of a number of \\"cherished texts that become troubling to their admirers after the discovery of their 'plagiarized' elements,\\" which make it \\"apparent that appropriation, mimicry, quotation, allusion, and sublimated collaboration consist of a kind of sine qua non of the creative act, cutting across all forms and genres in the realm of cultural production.\\" Film adaptations The book has been adapted twice into a feature film of the same title. The Manchurian Candidate (1962) is considered a classic of the political thriller genre. It was directed by John Frankenheimer and starred Laurence Harvey as Shaw, Frank Sinatra as Marco, and Angela Lansbury as Eleanor in an Academy Award-nominated performance. The Manchurian Candidate (2004) was directed by Jonathan Demme, and starred Liev Schreiber as Shaw, Denzel Washington as Marco, and Meryl Streep as Eleanor. It was generally well received by critics, and moderately successful at the box office. The film updated the conflict (and brainwashing) to the Persian Gulf War in 1991, had a U.S. corporation (called \\"Manchurian Global\\") as the perpetrator of the brainwashing and conspiracy instead of foreign Communist groups, and dropped the Johnny Iselin character in favor of making both Shaw and his mother elected politicians. Both adaptations discard several elements of the book. The book spends more time describing the brainwashers and the facility in Manchuria where the Americans were held. The head of the project grants Raymond a \\"gift\\"; after his brainwashing, he becomes quite sexually active, in contrast to his reserved nature beforehand where he had not even kissed his love interest, Jocelyn Jordan. In the novel, Mrs. Iselin and her son travel abroad, where she uses him to kill various political figures and possibly Jocelyn Jordan's first husband. Rosie, Marco's love interest, is the ex-fiancee of one of his associates handling the Shaw case for Army Intelligence, making things between the couple tense. The movie adaptations also all but omit the novel's portrayal of incest between Raymond and his mother, only hinting at it with a mouth-to-mouth kiss. As a child, Mrs. Iselin was sexually abused by her father, but fell in love with him and idolized him after his early death. Towards the end of the book, as Raymond is hypnotized by the Queen of Diamonds, he reminds her of her father and they sleep together. The 1962 version does not state outright the political affiliation of Senators Iselin and Jordan (implied to be Republicans), although in the 2004 film the equivalent characters are Democrats. According to David Willis McCullough, Senator Iselin is modelled on Republican senator Joseph McCarthy and, according to Condon, Shaw's mother is based on McCarthy's counsel Roy Cohn. in See also *List of assassinations in fiction *Conspiracy thriller *Brainwashing Notes References * Condon, Richard.

He has published several books and won a number of prominent awards. Life and work Benson was born in Glasgow and raised in Troon, Scotland. His pictures have appeared in Life,He officially joined the staff 1 January 1973, just before Life suspended weekly publication 29 December 1972, and thereafter he contributed to the monthly publicationVanity Fair, and The New Yorker. He took over a hundred cover shots for People. Benson was assigned to travel with The Beatles on their inaugural American tour in 1964. One of his most recognisable images shows the band in a gleeful pillow fight at the hotel Georges V in Paris. Other celebrities Benson has photographed include Bobby Fischer, Michael Jackson, who allowed him access to his bedroom, and Elizabeth Taylor, whom Benson photographed before and after her brain surgery. He has also photographed political figures, including every U.S. president since Dwight D. Eisenhower, and covered war zones. Benson was standing next to Robert F. Kennedy when the senator was shot on 5 June 1968 and has remarked on the difficulty of steeling himself to document the historic moment: \\"I kept telling myself 'this is for history, pull yourself together, fail tomorrow, not today.'\\" Benson has been the subject of many exhibitions, including one organised by the Scottish National Portrait Galley at the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution. Benson was the recipient of the 2005 Lucie Award for Lifetime Achievement in Portrait Photography and the 2005 American Photo Award for Photography. He has twice been named Magazine Photographer of the Year by the National Press Photographers Association (1981 and 1985). He was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Scottish Press Photography Awards in April 2006. Benson was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Photographic Society in 2009. Benson was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours. In 2014 he took an official photographic portrait of the Queen, commissioned by the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. This was more than fifty years after his first portrait of the Queen, taken when she opened a coal mine in 1957. He is the subject of a BBC Scotland documentary titled Photography: Harry Benson (1985), directed by Ken MacGregor and written by William McIlvanney and of the 2015 documentary Shoot First directed by Matthew Miele and Justin Bare.

Fort Pitt Bridge with Downtown Pittsburgh in the background. Roads and infrastructure =Streets= 220px Pittsburgh is home to several notable streets. Roslyn Place is a small wooden-paved cul-de- sac located in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The street was built in 1914 in the Nicolson Pavement style and is home to the historic Roslyn Place district. Canton Avenue is the steepest officially recorded public street in the United States. East Carson Street has one of the largest concentrations of 19th-century homes, which has prompted outsiders to call the neighborhood the City's Georgetown. It includes many bars and restaurants as well as residences. Grant Street is the main government and business corridor in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is home to the global headquarters of U.S. Steel, Koppers Chemicals, Federated Investors, and Oxford Development. It also is home to the seat of Allegheny County, City of Pittsburgh and the regional Federal Government offices. It is part of the Pittsburgh Central Downtown Historic District. =Expressways= Pittsburgh has a high number of freeze/thaw cycles in the winter, sometimes blamed for the difficulty of maintaining local roads. The hills and rivers form many barriers to transportation within the city. Map showing major highways in Pittsburgh and its surrounding region The main highway connecting Pittsburgh to the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76) on the east is I-376, known to locals as the \\"Parkway East.\\" It includes the locally-notorious Squirrel Hill interchange, where unusual traffic patterns and the adjoining tunnel often cause traffic congestion. Several accidents have involved tall trucks getting stuck against the tunnel roof. Also part of I-376 is the \\"Parkway West,\\" which leads from downtown Pittsburgh to the Pittsburgh International Airport's main terminal and leads into the contiguous Airport Parkway and Southern Expressway. I-279, known as the \\"Parkway North,\\" runs north of the city to merge with I-79. It connects the city with the North Hills and the Cranberry area. There is no \\"Parkway South\\". I-579, or the \\"Crosstown Expressway,\\" is a spur off of I-279 that alleviates downtown and North Shore traffic headed north or south and to events at either the convention center or the PPG Paints Arena. North of the city, the Parkway North and a short section of Interstate 579 over the Veterans Bridge have reversible high occupancy vehicle HOV lanes for rush-hour commuting, which require a minimum of two occupants per vehicle for use; no electric/hybrid vehicle \\"HOV OK\\" program has yet been made available. On August 25, 1995, six people were killed in a head-on collision on the HOV lanes after PennDOT employee William Dean Snyder failed to follow procedures. Snyder maintained open the traffic gates for both directions simultaneously.

I-76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike), I-79, and I-70 form a roughly triangular-shaped \\"beltway,\\" but the distance of these roads from the city center and the need to exit and enter each leg in order to continue circling the city render them impractical as a beltway; commuters are forced to use secondary roads to go from suburb to suburb. The Allegheny County Belt System is an attempt at dealing with this without building additional infrastructure. The Pittsburgh Wayfinder System is a similar system that aims to guide travelers to popular destinations and services in the city proper. File:Pennsylvania State Route 837 (4181931363).jpgGreen Belt on PA 837 File:Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (4190168264).jpgDual Blue and Green Belt signage =Bridges and tunnels= Pittsburgh is a city of bridges: over 2,000 bridges dot the landscape of Allegheny County. The southern entrance to Downtown is through the Fort Pitt Tunnel and then over the Fort Pitt Bridge. The Panhandle Bridge, a former railroad bridge, carries the Port Authority's Blue and Red (formerly 42S/47L) subway lines across the Monongahela River. Other notable bridges are Fort Duquesne Bridge, the Liberty Bridge, and The Three Sisters. Notable tunnels include two interstate highway tunnels on I-376, Fort Pitt Tunnel and Squirrel Hill Tunnel; major traffic tunnels Armstrong Tunnel and Liberty Tunnels; the light rail tunnel, Mt. Washington Transit Tunnel, the Schenley Tunnel, the Wabash Tunnel and Corliss Tunnel. File:Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.jpgAt least 15 of Pittsburgh's bridges are visible in this aerial photo. File:Liberty Tunnels.jpgLiberty Tunnels Regional mass transit Local public transportation is coordinated by the Port Authority of Allegheny County, or \\"PAT,\\" the 14th-largest urban mass transit system in the United States. It services , including all of Allegheny county and portions of Armstrong, Beaver, Washington, and Westmoreland counties. PAT maintains a network of intracity bus routes, two inclines on Mt. Washington above Downtown (mostly a tourist attraction rather than a means of commuting), and a light rail/busway system. PAT discontinued its commuter rail system, the PATrain, in 1989. = Pittsburgh Light Rail = Station Square and prepares to enter the Mount Washington Transit Tunnel. The light rail network is a direct descendant of the original streetcar system, which once numbered dozens of lines and included interurban routes to neighboring cities such as Washington and Charleroi. The current network comprises five routes on of track, operated by modern articulated light rail vehicles. Although most is on dedicated right-of-way, including the Mt. Washington Transit Tunnel, trains still street run in the Beechview neighborhood. Once across the Monongahela River trains enter a subway to serve Downtown Pittsburgh. Since March 2012, the North Shore Connector has extended service across the Allegheny River, via tunnel, to such destinations as PNC Park, Heinz Field, and Rivers Casino.

The latter use high-speed articulated buses that run at grade and above ground on their own right-of-way with platform stations, much like a rail system. In some instances, such as the Mount Washington tunnel, these buses travel along paved sections of the light rail line. There are currently three routes: the South Busway, from downtown to the southern part of Allegheny County, the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway, from the Amtrak station to the eastern suburbs, and the West Busway, to the western suburbs. Future plans include extending the West Busway to the Pittsburgh International Airport. All light rail/busway stations outside the downtown have PAT station shuttles that serve the surrounding neighborhoods, and sections of the metropolitan area not served by the light rail/busway system, including most of the northern suburbs, have regular PAT bus routes. The mass transit systems of Beaver, Fayette, Lawrence, Washington, and Westmoreland counties (including Mid Mon Valley Transit Authority) operate their own commuter shuttles to and from the city; the private company Myers Coach Line operates commuter service from Butler County. The mass transit system of Monongalia County, West Virginia also provides connections to Pittsburgh. In early 2005 the Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission proposed combining the Port Authority with the nine surrounding metro counties transit agencies.

Efforts have been made to incorporate the bicycle into the transportation system. The Three Rivers Heritage Trail encompasses all the trails in the city. The Eliza Furnace Trail, known locally as the \\"Jail Trail\\", stretches from Downtown (at the Allegheny County Jail) to the East End region, where trail access can be found along some roads. The North Shore Trail spans from the Alcosan plant along the Ohio River and continues along the Allegheny River to Millvale. The Southside Trail follows the Monongahela River and beyond Baldwin Borough connects to McKeesport via the Great Allegheny Passage. This trail, in connection with the C&O; Canal Trail, forms a continuous motorist-free route from Point State Park in Pittsburgh to Washington, D.C. PAT has installed bike racks on all buses and it allows bikes on its subway/busway system at all times. Healthy Ride station Bike Pittsburgh (BikePGH) is the local bicycle advocacy group and is working to make Pittsburgh increasingly safe, accessible, and friendly to bicycle transportation. The non-profit bike collective,Free Ride, recycles bicycles and bike parts, teaches bicycle construction, and has programs to sell or earn a rebuilt bicycle. Additionally, bicycles can be borrowed at two places along the Heritage Trail through the Friends of the Riverfront/Dasani Blue Bikes program. In 2014, the City began installing segregated bike lanes, which provide greater physical safety to the biker. On September 6, bike lanes that stretch from Downtown Pittsburgh to the 16th Street Bridge on Penn Avenue were installed. In order to accommodate these bike lanes, the Westbound lane of Penn Avenue was removed, making it one way. Other segregated bike lanes were installed on Schenley Drive in Oakland, and Saline Street in Greenfield. The \\"Healthy Ride\\" bicycle-sharing system entered service in Spring, 2016, supplied by Nextbike. Price is $2 per half-hour, or $12 or $20 per month. =Inclines and staircases= Two inclines ascend Mount Washington: Duquesne Incline and Monongahela Incline. Pittsburgh had considerably more inclines\\"Inclines Listed by Location\\" Bridges and Tunnels of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Retrieved May 2, 2007. and the Monongahela Incline was paralleled by a freight incline. Pittsburgh has more public staircases (737) than any other city in the United States, followed by Cincinnati and San Francisco. Many of these staircases have street names, and lead to hillside neighborhoods that can be difficult to access by car in winter.

Freight Railroads During the heyday of the steel industry, Pittsburgh was among the largest rail centers not only in the nation, but the world. For many years, the multiple rail crossings in the suburb of Port Perry at the mouth of Turtle Creek on the Monongahela River and adjacent to the Edgar Thomson Works and Duquesne mills, was the highest concentration of freight traffic in the world. Even today, with river traffic included, Port Perry is often very near or at the top of the list. The Conway Yard to the west of the city along the Ohio River was the largest rail yard in the world from 1956 until 1980. From the beginning of the industrial era in America through its collapse in the 1980s, Pittsburgh was a key market for the nation's largest and most important railroads (most notably the Pennsylvania Railroad [the largest company in the world for much of the 20th century], and the New York Central Railroad [via the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie], Baltimore & Ohio and Pittsburgh & West Virginia). Despite the near-complete collapse of heavy industry in the Northeast, Pittsburgh remains an extremely important link in the nation's rail network. Current railroads in Pittsburgh include: =Class I railroads= Norfolk Southern (NS) Norfolk Southern operates the former assets of Conrail, composed of the Pennsylvania Railroad, instrumental in the formation of modern Pittsburgh. NS operates three lines through Pittsburgh: *the original line, the Pittsburgh Line, from U.S. Steel's Edgar Thomson Steel Mill in Braddock, PA, over the Allegheny River near Downtown Pittsburgh, into Island Ave Yard where it becomes the Fort Wayne Line; *the Mon Line, along the south bank of the Monongahela River from West Brownsville, PA, to Island Ave Yard, formerly the Pittsburgh, Virginia and Charleston Railroad. This line is used by coal trains from southern Pennsylvania and trains with over-height cars that cannot fit under the roof of Penn Station on the Pittsburgh Line, accessing it via a branch just east of Braddock to the Port Perry bridge. The Mon Line joins the Fort Wayne Line at Island Ave Yard after crossing the Ohio River on the Ohio Connecting (OC) Railroad bridge; *the Conemaugh Line, along the north shore of the Allegheny River, serving several coal branch lines and power plants. Operations are centered on a small yard in Etna, PA. On the Mon and Pittsburgh lines over 60 trains a day pass through the city. CSX CSX operates the former Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B&O;) and the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad (P&LE;). Many of the old B&O; lines have been removed or are unused. Formerly an important part of the B&O; system, Glenwood Yard is leased and operated by the Allegheny Valley Railroad for local jobs. The yard used to give access to the B&O;'s Grant Street Station in Downtown Pittsburgh. The building has been rebuilt into a PNC Bank building and the old right-of-way is now a bike path. The B&O; main line, which cuts north and under across Pittsburgh by the Schenley Tunnel, is now used by the AVR. The 33rd Street Railroad Bridge over the Allegheny River is still used: AVR trains connect with Norfolk Southern's Pittsburgh Line about a mile east of Penn Station. CSX freight trains use the former P&LE; through McKeesport, PA, and Braddock, PA, before crossing the Mononghela River into Homestead, PA. The P&LE; line and the Mon Line run side by side until the Mon Line crosses the Ohio Connecting Railroad Bridge at McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania. On an average day, the P&LE; line carries about 30‚Äì35 trains. =Class II railroads= Wheeling & Lake Erie The Wheeling & Lake Erie is a regional railroad incorporated in 1990 after the Norfolk and Western Railway sold trackage from the original Wheeling & Lake Erie Railroad. *Wheeling and Lake Erie R.R. Bessemer & Lake Erie The Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad runs north from the North Bessemer Yard in Penn Hills to Conneaut, Ohio. In 2004, the B&LE; was purchased by Canadian National Railway. =Class III railroads= Allegheny Valley Railroad The Allegheny Valley Railroad runs mostly on former Pennsylvania Railroad and Baltimore & Ohio Railroad lines. *AVR (Allegheny Valley Railroad) Pittsburgh and Ohio Central Railroad The Pittsburgh and Ohio Central Railroad operates former Pennsylvania Railroad trackage on the Chartiers Branch and the Panhandle Route to the southwest.

Since Pepin's death in December 714, his grandson and heir Theudoald, his widow Plectrude, his bastard son Charles Martel, his successor as mayor of the palace in Neustria Ragenfrid, and the new king Chilperic II had been waging a war for ascendancy. Though Ragenfrid and Chilperic had begun with successes and Plectrude and Theudoald were removed early, Martel turned the tide of war and eventually forced the surrender of all his opponents. After their defeat at the Battle of Vincy, Chilperic and Ragenfrid allied with Odo the Great, the independent duke of Aquitaine, and marched on Soissons. Unfortunately, Charles had anticipated this, and was awaiting them, with an ever better trained core of veterans, many of whom would serve him all their adult lives. That army easily defeated the allied forces of Odo, Chilperic, and Ragenfrid near Soissons. The king fled with his ducal ally to the land south of the Loire and Ragenfrid fled to Angers. Soon Odo made peace and surrendered Chilperic to Charles and Ragenfrid made peace too. The war was over and Charles was undisputed dux Francorum. Charles chose not to execute any of his enemies, indeed, his nephew would serve in his army, and was treated kindly. Nor was his grandmother Plectrude treated with anything but kindness. Finally, Charles allowed both the deposed king, Chilperic and his mayor, Ragenfrid to live. Norwich has commented that \\"either Charles Martel possessed a degree of decency and kindness to defeated foes unknown in that age, or his belief in himself was so great that he felt he could afford kindness as the ultimate show of strength in allowing them to live after their various plots and machinations against him.\\" Further reading *Oman, Charles.

Ivane Kazbegi was born into the family of noble descent. Trained at a military college in St. Petersburg, he joined the Imperial Russian army in 1878. As an artillery lieutenant-colonel, he took part in the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-05. He was promoted to the rank of colonel in 1912 and to that of major-general in 1915. During World War I, Kazbegi was a deputy commander of the Caucasian Grenadier Artillery Brigade. After Georgia's declaration of independence in 1918, he served for the Georgian Ministry of War and headed its administrative division. The Soviet invasion of Georgia in 1921 forced him into exile to Constantinople, whence he moved to Poland in 1922. Like many of his Georgian colleagues, Kazbegi became a contract officer for the Polish army. In 1926, he became a major general in the Polish service and lectured at the Military Academy.

U. Grozier in command. Soon after her commissioning, she steamed to New York, NY, where she decommissioned on 24 August 1865, and was laid up at the New York Navy Yard. Nausett was a Casco- class, light-draft monitor intended for service in the shallow bays, rivers, and inlets of the Confederacy. These warships sacrificed armor plate for a shallow draft and were fitted with a ballast compartment designed to lower them in the water during battle. Design revisions The contract to Donald McKay was originally announced in 1863. Though the original designs for the Casco-class monitors were drawn by John Ericsson, the final revision was created by Chief Engineer Alban C. Stimers following Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont's failed bombardment of Fort Sumter in 1863. By the time that the plans were put before the Monitor Board in New York City, Ericsson and Stimers had a poor relationship, and Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair John Lenthall had little connection to the board. This resulted in the plans being approved and 20 vessels ordered without serious scrutiny of the new design. $14 million US was allocated for the construction of these vessels. It was discovered that Stimers had failed to compensate for the armor his revisions added to the original plan and this resulted in excessive stress on the wooden hull frames and a freeboard of only . Stimers was removed from the control of the project and Ericsson was called in to undo the damage. He was forced to raise the hulls of the monitors under construction by to make them seaworthy.

In August 1875, she was broken up by John Roach of New York.

His most notable invention was a reaping machine, patented in 1833, that was a rival of a similar machine, patented in 1834, produced by Cyrus McCormick. Hussey also invented a steam plow, a machine for grinding out hooks and eyes, a mill for grinding corn and cobs, a husking machine, a machine for crushing sugar cane, a machine for making artificial ice, a candle-making machine, and other devices.Greeno, p. 5.Canine, p. 30. However, he devoted the prime of his life to perfecting his reaping machine.Greeno, p. 34, quoting an 1854 letter from Edward Stabler. Although the Hussey reaper was ultimately surpassed in the marketplace by the reaping machines of Cyrus McCormick, Hussey was the first person to make, patent, and sell such a machine in the United States.Canine, p. 29. His machine was first in that it was first to be patented and had been worked in at least eight states before McCormick's machine had left the valley of Virginia.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 164. Moreover, Hussey's cutting mechanism, the combination of a reciprocating knife and slotted guard fingers, became, with some further modifications, the standard one for use in harvesting machinery.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 161.Miller, p. 39.  Early Life to 1820s  Obed Hussey was born in 1792 to a Quaker family in Maine, but moved at an early age to the island of Nantucket.Hussey's widow was uncertain whether he was born on Nantucket or near Biddeford, Maine, remarking that he \\"had many relatives in both places and used to say, jokingly, that he belonged 'all along shore.'\\" Steward, p. 65, quoting a letter from Hussey's widow, Eunice Lamberton. Little is known of his early life, but as a young man, he sailed on whaling ships to the Pacific Ocean, where he was among the crew who would row after the whales.Greeno, p. 17, letter of Hussey to Edward Stabler dated March 12, 1854. It may have been during a whaling trip that he lost the sight of one eye. Whaling remained an occupation for Hussey into his thirties. From July 1820 to April 1823, he served on the crew of the whaleship Atlas on a voyage from Nantucket to the South Seas. During this voyage, off the coast of Chile late in the day on January 14, 1821, Hussey was aboard a whaleboat pursuing a sperm whale when the whale stoved in the whaleboat. He and the other crew members were thrown into the sea, but managed to stay afloat by hanging onto the partially submerged wreckage of the boat. The Atlas was too far away to be aware of what had happened and darkness soon fell. The crew were rescued only when a search boat from the Atlas happened upon them despite the darkness. Hussey kept journals detailing these experiences.McDonough, p. 2.  The Hussey Reaper  = Initial Development: 1831-1842 = By 1831, Hussey was at work on his reaping machine, spending at least part-time at an agricultural implements factory in Baltimore.Greeno, p. 6. However, the hilly landscape of Maryland made it an unsuitable location for a field trial, so when the machine was ready, Hussey took it to Ohio,Greeno, p. 8. where he had a supporter in Cincinnati who provided both financing and manufacturing facilities.Greeno, pp. 9-10. Working in Cincinnati during the winter of 1832-1833, Hussey rebuilt his reaping machine there, completing it in time for the harvest of 1833.Greeno, p. 9. On July 2, 1833, Hussey exhibited his machine before the Hamilton County Agricultural Society near Carthage, Ohio,Greeno, pp. 37-38, quoting an 1854 letter from Edward Stabler. where it performed successfully.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 159. Hussey patented his machine later that year, on December 31, 1833.Greeno, p. 12.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 160. In the spring of 1834, Mechanics' Magazine gave coverage to Hussey's reaper.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 91. That report was seen by Cyrus McCormick, who promptly wrote a letter to the editor claiming that he had invented and field- tested a reaping machine in 1831 and that use of the principles of the machine by others was an infringement of his rights.Canine, p. 32. Thus began a fierce rivalry between Hussey and McCormick that would last more than a quarter of a century. There had been unsuccessful attempts by others to build reaping machines before Hussey and McCormick.Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 56-73. These included thirty-three English and twenty-two American inventions, as well as two French and one German.Miller, p. 17. In the United States, seventeen patents for harvesting machines had been granted before that of Hussey, the earliest in 1803; however, Hussey's was the first \\"really practical\\" reaping machine to be patented.Wheeler, Cyrenus, Jr. The Inventors and Inventions of Cayuga County, N.Y. Auburn, N. Y.: Published by the Author, 1882. Page 54. As for McCormick, although he built and used a reaper in 1831, he did not patent it until 1834, about six months after Hussey's patent, nor had he sold reapers to others.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 93. Instead, after obtaining the patent, McCormick turned his attention to other business matters, selling no reapers until at least 1839.Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 92-98. As of 1834, McCormick's reaper was still marginal, while Hussey's machine was a viable reaper.Gies, \\"The Great Reaper War.\\" Hussey gave successful demonstrations of his machine in 1834 in New York stateGreeno, p. 38.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 165. and in 1835 in Missouri, New York state, and possibly also in Illinois, Ohio, and Indiana.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 166. In 1836, Hussey reapers achieved results in Maryland that enhanced Hussey's reputation.Greeno, p. 39.Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 155-167. In 1837, he had some reapers manufactured in Maryland and up to six of them were sold there, while other Hussey machines were built in Cincinnati and marketed in Ohio, Indiana, and Missouri.Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 167-168. In August 1838, Hussey moved to Baltimore and that city became the home of the Hussey reaper.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 168. Also that year, his machine won praise from the Philadelphia Society for the Promotion of Agriculture and performed successfully elsewhere.Greeno, p. 40. For the 1839 harvest, ten or twelve machines were made and it was introduced in Delaware. Hussey also received favorable press notices that year.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 169. For the 1840 harvest, Hussey made thirty-six machines with some gearing alterations, but, he said, \\"the credit of the machine suffered a retrograde.\\" He also introduced the machine in Virginia.Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 169-170. His market declined for the next three years, selling only two in 1843.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 170. In 1841, Virginia planters gave the Hussey machine mixed reviews, though it continued to be viewed favorably in the Genesee Valley of New York state.Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 170-171. The 1842 season brought increased competition from the Cyrus McCormick reaper and Hussey was able to sell only 10 machines, despite offering two models, the smaller of which was priced slightly below McCormick's.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 172. Nevertheless, Hussey's reaper \\"held first place\\" among all reapers in use prior to 1843. = The First \\"War of the Reapers\\" and Its Aftermath: 1843-1850 = Early in 1843, Hussey wrote a letter to the editor of Southern Planter, published in March of that year, in which he noted the attention McCormick's reaper had been given and expressed the intention of entering his reaper into contests with McCormick's; this marked the beginning of the first \\"war of the reapers.\\"Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 172-173.Canine, p. 33. The field of battle was to be a farm near Richmond, Virginia in the region of the lower James River.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 187. The contest was planned for June 30, 1843, but on June 27, Hussey learned that McCormick was operating his machine in the area, so Hussey brought his reaper to the same field and challenged McCormick to a competitive trial. With a small crowd of neighbors looking on, McCormick began cutting first. Before Hussey got started, a shower drenched the wheat. Hussey's machine could not cut the wet wheat, leaving McCormick the winner of this impromptu meet.Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 190-191.Lyons, p. 153. Hussey's luck continued to work against him for the main competition on June 30. Because a bridge had been swept away by high water, Hussey was unable to get his better, larger machine to the contest field. Instead, Hussey put his lesser, smaller machine up against McCormick's and it was unable to cut as much grain. McCormick was judged the winner, but under the circumstances, the jurors had reservations and Hussey protested the award.Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 191-192.Lyons, p. 154. One of the jurors invited an additional match in his fields the following week. The fields included some areas with tangled wheat. McCormick refused to try his machine there, while Hussey, this time with his larger machine, put his reaper to the task. The result was that he broke his sickle and rake. No winner was declared; nevertheless, the owner of the field concluded that Hussey's machine was better for use in heavy wheat.Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 192-193.Greeno, p. 42. Hussey sold only two reapers following these contests, while McCormick sold twenty-nine.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 193. In 1844, Hussey sought to show that his machine could cut hemp in Kentucky,Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 196. and in 1845, Hussey reapers were used in the middle seaboard states, New York, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, and probably in Ohio and Kentucky.Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 197. However, during this period, Hussey focused on the eastern markets, where his machine was especially in use as a mower.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 203. In 1846, Hussey introduced his reapers in Champaign County, Ohio and arranged for local manufacture of his machines.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 200. Various testimonials from 1845 to 1850 report positive results for his reapers.Greeno, pp. 155-166, quoting Stabler. In the late 1840s, Hussey gained ground in the eastern seaboard states partly because McCormick's 1846 reapers suffered from poor workmanship in Virginia.Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 198, 201. Hussey sold 50 or 60 reapers in 1850, and they were well received from Pennsylvania south to North Carolina.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 202. Hussey's machine of 1850 cut grass well, while McCormick's did not. Thus, by 1850, the reaper of Obed Hussey \\"had proved its worth.\\"Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 377. By that year, however, many new competitors had entered the field because the original patents of both Hussey and McCormick had expired; both men were then forced to compete with their own ideas.Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 179, 410.See also \\"Patent Matters,\\" below. = The Second \\"War of the Reapers\\" and the 1850s = The first world's fair, an international exhibition of industrial arts known as the Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations, was planned for London in 1851. Hussey and McCormick both sought to expand their markets by displaying their reapers at this event, held at the newly-constructed Crystal Palace, a nineteen-acre conservatory of iron and glass, beginning May 1.Canine, p. 41.Hutchinson, v. 2, p. 405. On July 24, a head-to-head trial of reapers by Hussey and McCormick, as well a third of English design, was held. Hussey and McCormick were both absent and Hussey's machine was operated by an agent who had never seen it work. When its cutter clogged, the operator did not know how to clear it, nor did he know how to adjust its platform, resulting in a failure of the rake. The English machine was also unsuccessful, but McCormick's reaper performed well enough to cut an estimated twenty acres a day.Canine, p. 42-43.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 389. At a second trial on August 6, while Hussey was in France, Hussey's reaper again did not work well; McCormick, who was present for this trial, was awarded a Grand Council Medal.Canine, p. 43.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 391. Hussey protested that the trials were unjust. He began demonstrating his machine in England and, with his personal supervision, it performed efficiently; his reputation revived.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 393. Another contest was set for 25 and 27 September 1851. Hussey's machine performed better and Hussey gained considerable prestige.Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 393-394. Later that season, Hussey exhibited before Prince Albert, who then ordered two machines.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 394. Also in 1851, a Hussey machine made in England reached Austria.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 407. Hussey again went to England in 1852 to promote his reaper.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 399. He had success in at least two contests early in the 1852 harvest, but when he took his reaper to Scotland, the Scottish juries awarded prizes to their own.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 400. Hussey returned to England for several months in 1853 and was apparently satisfied with his success.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 402. By 1855, however, the McCormick reaper had been adapted to English conditions and English buyers had shifted toward McCormick's machine.Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 400-403. Nevertheless, by the late 1850s, Hussey had manufacturers in the British Isles making a version of his machine.Hutchinson, v. 2, p 411. These Hussey machines, priced lower than McCormick's, gained increasing favor, especially in Scotland.Hutchinson, v. 2, p. 414. In 1855, Hussey attended another world's fair, the International Exposition in Paris. This and the 1856 Agricultural Congress, also in Paris, provided opportunities to demonstrate Hussey's reaper in France.Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 404-405. Hussey achieved a \\"gratifying measure of success,\\" but was unable to win the top awards, which went to McCormick. In 1857, a Hussey machine made in Vienna was defeated by a McCormick machine in a field trial in heavy rye near Budapest.Hutchinson, v. 2, p. 416. During this same period back in the United States, the rivalry between Hussey and McCormick had continued.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 411. Hussey won a contest with McCormick during the 1852 Ohio harvest, while trials in Geneva, New York were inconclusive.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 418. Hussey gained ground in Maryland when McCormick failed to appear for a planned contest there.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 417. In 1853, Hussey received two votes to McCormick's one in a Virginia trial, while another maker's machine received two votes as well.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 419. Hussey's machine also held its own in a North Carolina match in 1854.Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 370-374, 420. That year Hussey also won a bronze medal at the New York Crystal Palace and a premium at the Pennsylvania Agricultural Society.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 420. In 1855, Hussey's factory in Baltimore produced 521 reaping machines, its maximum annual output, up from 385 in 1854. In the following years, however, his output declined, with annual totals of 163, 95, 19, 10, and 24, respectively, for the years 1856 through 1860.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 421. Between 1848 and 1860, McCormick manufactured more than ten times as many reaping machines as did Hussey, and by 1857, Hussey was no longer a serious competitor in the harvest field.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 449. = Patent Matters = Hussey's 1833 patent, good for a term of fourteen years, was scheduled to expire at the end of 1847. In 1845, he contacted the patent commissioner about obtaining an extension, but was advised to delay the application for renewal until near the end of the original term. He did so, but apparently not knowing that he was required to apply for a renewal at least thirty days before expiration of the patent, he waited until just ten or twelve days before the expiration date.Greeno, pp. 24-26. Having missed the legal deadline for a renewal through the patent office, Hussey could get a renewal only through an appeal to Congress for an extension.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 281. Meanwhile, Hussey had secured patents for an improvement to the reaping machine: \\"his famous open-back guard fingers.\\"Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 279. Patented on August 7, 1847, this improvement involved leaving openings at the back end of the slot in the guards for the escape of particles of straw or grass that might get in between the blades and guards.Greeno, p. 114, quoting Stabler. This served to prevent choking of the blades in the guards.Greeno, pp. 121, 125, quoting Stabler. Hussey saw his 1847 improvements as \\"perfecting\\" his reaper.Greeno, pp. 31-32, quoting Hussey. In 1848, Cyrus McCormick also faced the expiration of his original patent and he sought an extension through the patent office. Hussey and others opposed this extension. Hussey took the position that he opposed McCormick's extension as a matter of self-defense, because McCormick had petitioned Congress against Hussey's extension.Greeno, p. 95, quoting Stabler. On March 29 of that year, the patent office denied McCormick's application for an extension.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 290.Greeno, p. 94, quoting patent office report. The denial of McCormick's extension by the patent office meant that both Hussey and McCormick could get extensions of their original reaper patents only through Congress.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 291. Hussey's case for renewal was in part that he had not received sufficient compensation from his invention; rather than earning profit from his 1833 patent, Hussey had spent the fourteen-year term of the patent working to perfect his invention \\"without any return for time and labor,\\"Greeno, p. 31. leaving him \\"at the very door of poverty.\\"Greeno, pp. 30-31. Bills that would have extended Hussey's patent were introduced in 1848,S. 265, 30th Congress (1848). (View bill S. 265) 1854,S. 328, 33rd Congress (1854). (View bill S. 328) and 1856,S. 305, 34th Congress (1856). (View bill S. 305) but the matter ultimately was tabled.U.S. Senate Journal. 34th Cong., 3rd sess., February 7, 1857. Page 177. McCormick also was unable to win an extension through Congress.Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 298-299. In April 1857, Hussey obtained a reissue of his 1847 patent covering an open-back guard finger in combination with a vibrating scallop-edged cutter. He then sued McCormick, claiming infringement of the 1847 patent and seeking damages and an injunction to prevent further sales of the McCormick reaper. On September 19, 1859, the court ruled in favor of Hussey, finding that Hussey was the first inventor of the combination of the open-slotted guard finger and scalloped cutter, awarding damages of $80,000, and ordering McCormick to pay licensing fees to Hussey.Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 449-451.Lyons, p. 187. Also in 1859, Hussey sold his 1847 patent rights for $200,000.Greeno, p. 65. The buyer was a \\"syndicate of patent lawyers\\" who adapted the invention into a mowing-machine.Casson, p. 37. In 1861, after Hussey's death, his heirs successfully obtained an extension of his 1847 patents.Greeno, pp. 65-77.Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 452. Various manufacturers paid royalties to the Hussey heirs during the following years.Hutchinson, v. 2, pp. 376, 399.  Hussey the Man: Personal Characteristics  Admiring descriptions of Obed Hussey, \\"one of nature's noblemen,\\"Steward, p. 64, quoting a letter from Hussey's widow, Eunice Lamberton. are readily available. It has been said that he: * \\"was warm hearted, genial and companionable.\\" * \\"maintained a reputation for uprightness and probity.\\" * was \\"inventive, poetic, and as whimsical as the weather.\\"Casson, p. 35. * was \\"[e]xtremely sensitive, modest and unassuming, generous almost to a fault.\\". * had a \\"great amiability of disposition and kindness of heart which made him many friends.\\"The American Annual Monitor for 1861; or, Obituary of the Members of the Society of Friends in America for 1860.

Moreover, he was \\"highly educated, cultured and refined; a philosopher as well as a writer of both poetry and prose, of more than ordinary ability.\\"Steward, p. 65, quoting letter from Hussey's widow, Eunice Lamberton. His writings included four journals chronicling whaling voyages and two manuscript volumes of poetry.McDonough, pp. 1-2. In matters of religion, Hussey was a Quaker who maintained his affiliation throughout his life. Records show that he transferred his membership from Quaker meeting to Quaker meeting when his changed his residence.Transfer certificates show that Hussey removed from Nantucket to New York in 1825, from New York to Cincinnati in 1831, and from Cincinnati to Baltimore in 1839. See Hinshaw, William Wade. Encyclopedia of American Quaker Genealogy. Vol. 3, p. 180; Vol. 5, p. 912. See also Quaker Meeting Records, Maryland, Baltimore Monthly Meeting, List of Members, 1848-1882. While in his personal life Hussey may have been \\"the picture of Quaker beneficence\\" and \\"without an enemy in the world,\\" his business adversaries saw him as \\"a fiercely tenacious, one-eyed devil\\" who \\"must be watched with caution.\\"Hutchinson, v. 1, p. 197, quoting 1845 letter of McCormick to his father. In this context, at least, his modesty has been called a myth and his \\"common reputation for lack of aggressiveness\\" has been said to be \\"disproved by almost every move of his career.\\"Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 175, 190, 415. Nevertheless, observers have concluded that Hussey was not skilled in matters of business, citing his reluctance to incorporate into his machine any features he did not personally inventCanine, p. 36. and his failure to make much money from his invention.Hutchinson, v. 1, pp. 174-175. Hussey's strength was as an inventor and in that regard he was called a \\"genius,\\" albeit an \\"erratic\\" one. He worked incessantly at his inventions throughout his life.  Marriage and Children  In 1856, Hussey married Eunice B. Starbuck, a 24-year-old who had also grown up on Nantucket.Barney Genealogical Record. Nantucket Historical Association Research Library. Person page 879. They had two daughters, Mary (1857-1859)Find A Grave Memorial no. 177381730. and Martha (1860-1932).Find A Grave Memorial no. 177381634. The family resided in Baltimore.  Death  On 4 August 1860, a Saturday, Hussey, on a trip to visit friends and family in Boston and Portland, was traveling by train from Boston to Portland, accompanied by his wife, their infant daughter, and a servant. As was the practice at the time, the train carried no water for passengers, but instead made stops where passengers could get off the train and get water. At such a stop in Exeter, New Hampshire, Hussey got off the train to retrieve some water for the child of a fellow passenger. While he was off the train, it started up unexpectedly. Hastily attempting to reboard the train, Hussey took a misstep, fell between two cars, and was run over.Boston & Maine Railroad, Twenty-Sixth Annual Report (1860). The train was stopped but he had been killed instantly. His body was taken back on the train and was accompanied by his family, in great distress, on to Portland, later to be removed to Baltimore,\\"Fatal Railway Accident,\\"Nantucket Weekly Mirror (Nantucket, Massachusetts), 11 Aug 1860, page 2 (citing the Portland Advertiser).\\"The Late Railroad Accident, and Death of Mr. Hussey,\\" The Daily Exchange (Baltimore, Maryland), 13 Aug 1860, page 1.\\"Fatal Accident to Obed Hussey, Esq.,\\" The Baltimore Sun (Baltimore, Maryland), 7 Aug 1860, page 1. where he was buried at Green Mount Cemetery.Find A Grave Memorial no. 78018089.

See C.G. Van der Merwe, Jacques Du Plessis, eds., Introduction to the Law of South Africa (The Hague, Netherlands: Kluwer Law International, 2004), 172. (conjunctissimi), and (2) a discretionary portion, or free estate (Germ frei verf√ºgbare Quote, Fr quotit√© disponible, It quota disponible, Sp tercio de libre disposici√≥n), to be freely disposed of by will. Forced heirship is generally a feature of civil-law legal systems which do not recognize total freedom of testation. Normally, the deceased's estate is in-gathered and wound up without discharging liabilities, which means accepting inheritance includes accepting the liabilities attached to inherited property. The forced estate is divided into shares which include the share of issue (legitime or child's share) and the spousal share. This provides a minimum protection that cannot be defeated by will. The free estate, on the other hand, is at the discretion of a testator to be distributed by will on death to whomever he or she chooses. Takers in the forced estate are known as forced heirs (Germ Pflichtteilserben, Noterben, Fr r√©servataires, It legittimari, Sp herederos forzosos). The expression comes from Louisianan legal language and is ultimately a calque of Spanish sucesi√≥n forzosa. Overview Forced heirship laws are most prevalent among civil law jurisdictions and in Islamic countries; these include major countries such as France, Italy, Spain, Saudi Arabia, and Japan. Reckoning shares in instances of multiple or no children and lack of surviving spouse vary from country to country. Advocates of forced heirship contend that it is perfectly proper for testators to be required to make adequate provision for their dependants, and that most countries in the world permit wills to be varied where they would leave dependants destitute. Critics suggest that there is a great difference between varying wills to the minimum degree to provide sufficient financial support for dependants, and prohibiting the testator from distributing the estate or a proportion of the estate to any female children, or younger male children, and that it cannot be any less repugnant to force a deceased person to distribute their assets in a certain manner on their death than it would be to tell them how they may do so during their lifetime. History The institution began as a Germanic custom for intestate inheritance (which was the norm) under which all of a deceased's personalty was divided into thirds‚Äîthe widow's part, bairns' part, and dead's partScots law terms. Also known as the customary share, orphanage share, and dead man's share in the custom of London, or alternatively as the customary share, portion natural, and legatory share in the custom of York.‚Äîthe last of which, consisting of clothes, weapons, farm animals and implements, was usually buried with the deceased. With the adoption of Christian funerary practices, it became common to gift away the dead's part, and after the revival of the will, and consequently of testation, the dead's part came to be freely disposable. Realty, or heritable property, on the other hand, was originally inherited in joint tenancy, termed gavelkind, and passed on to the kin group as a whole. However, after the household superseded the kin group in importance in the late Middle Ages, preference was given to the deceased's immediate family, specifically any surviving sons, and none could be favored over his siblings. However, gavelkind inheritance gave rise to inter-family rivalries, so primogeniture laws arose in some areas of feudal Europe giving preference to the eldest son in order to stem feuding. Nevertheless, under medieval communal society, family land could not be sold except for cause, and the family essentially had a right of first refusal (laudatio parentum) in any such sale; in some places, this restriction also applied to gifts. The family was so favored that in order to keep property within the same family, women‚Äîwho on marriage in effect joined another family‚Äîwere accorded very few property rights.T Hanson & B Corbett, \\"Forced Heirship - Trusts and Other Problems\\", (2009) 13, JGLRev, 174, cited in Meryl Thomas, Jersey Law Course 2010-11: Testate and Intestate Succession (St Helier, Jersey: Institute of Law, 2010), 101. Therefore, widows were universally disinherited, though they were varyingly entitled to a dower and/or a terce (or curtesy in the case of widowers), that is, one third of the heritable marital estate. The terce was earliest known as and first appears in the Ripuarian law code, making it also a localized Germanic custom. In the customs of York and London, for example, a widow was entitled both to her widow's part (customary share) and terce (widow's chamber), the last of which was half‚Äînot a third‚Äîof the marital estate. Eventually, these elements were all consolidated into the modern form of forced heirship most notably in Revolutionary France, which treated personalty and realty in the same way and applied gavelkind inheritance and the system of thirds to both forms of property. After abandoning dowries and dowers in the 20th century, many European countries created or increased the spousal share to be on par with the share of issue (legitime); Spain is an exception. Louisiana In Louisiana, Civil Code article 1493 dictates that \\"Forced heirs are descendants of the first degree who, at the time of the death of the decedent, are twenty-three years of age or younger or descendants of the first degree of any age who, because of mental incapacity or physical infirmity, are permanently incapable of taking care of their persons or administering their estates at the time of the death of the decedent\\".http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=108811 If they are not disinherited (LCC art. 1494) they qualify as forced heirs. The disinherison must be made expressly and for one of eight just causes; otherwise, it is null (LCC art. 1621). The legitime is equal to 25% of the patrimony (if one forced heir); or 50% (if more than one); and each forced heir will receive the lesser of an equal proportion of the legitime or what they would have received through intestacy (LCC art. 1495, Succession of Greenlaw). If a person who would have otherwise qualified as a forced heir dies before the parent, rights to that share may pass to that person's children, although how that share is distributed among them if one or more is an interdict remains unsettled law. Forced heirs may demand collation, whereby certain gifts received by any successor in the three years before the death of the parent may be subtracted from their share. Louisiana does not have a forced heirship provision for spouses, however at death the spouse's interest in any community property is converted to his or her separate property; and a usufruct is granted over the remaining community (with the forced heirs as naked owners of their respective shares). That usufruct terminates at death or remarriage. Wealthy individuals in the U.S. sometimes seek to circumvent forced heirship laws by transferring assets into an offshore company and seeking to settle the shares in the offshore company in a trust governed by the laws of a jurisdiction outside their domicile. See also * Legitime Succession of Lauga (1993) 624 So.2d 1156 say Art 1493 is unconstitutional so the 23 year age limit does not apply.

The place is also known as Thirunarayanapuram. It is built on rocky hills, known as Yadugiri, Yaadavagiri and Yadushailadeepa, overlooking the Cauvery valley. Melukote is about 51 km (32 miles) from Mysore and 133 km (83 mi) from Bangalore. Melukote is the location of the Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple, with a collection of crowns and jewels which are brought to the temple for the annual celebration. On the top of the hill is the temple of Yoganarasimha. Many more shrines and ponds are located in the town. Melukote is home to the Academy of Sanskrit Research, which has collected thousands of Vedic and Sanskrit manuscripts. Early in the 12th century, the famous Srivaishnava saint Sri Ramanujacharya, who hailed from Tamil Nadu, stayed at Melukote for about 12 years. It has thus become a prominent centre of the Srivaishnava sect.  Geography  Melukote is a municipal town and holy centre of the same name, situated at a distance of 36 km (22 miles) north-west of Mandya, and 51 km (32 miles) north of Mysore. According to mythological account, this place was known as Narayanadri, Vedadri, Yadavadri, Yathishaila and Tirunarayanapura. The name of the place is derived from the temple of Narayanaswamy which is built on the hillock, surrounded by a fort. It is built on a granite rocky hill-range named Yadugiri, which is high above sea level. History Early in the 12th century, the great Srivaishnava saint Ramanujacharya took up his residence and lived in this location for about 14 years. It thus became a prominent centre of Srivaishnavism. Large numbers of Iyengar Brahmins migrated and settled in the region, forming the Mandyam Iyengar community. They resisted and rejected to forcefully convert to islam By Tipu Sultan and helped British to fight against Him. People of Melkote do not celebrate Deepawali (the festival of lights) till date since November 10, 1790 (Naraka Chaturdashi). It was the date when Tipu Sultan slaughtered in many cruel ways more than 800 Mandyam Iyengars of this town as the Iyengars along with Rani Lakshmammani secretly planned with George Harris, a Major General in the Madras Army of East India Company to dethrone Tipu Sultan.. People of Melukote thus do not celebrate Deepawali but mourn on the festival of lights every year. Unfortunately, this event is not mentioned by any contemporary sources or writers like Buchanan. Cheluva-Narayana Swamy Temple Cheluva-Narayana Swamy Temple The principal temple is a square building of large dimensions but very plain, dedicated to Lord Cheluva-Narayana Swamy or Thirunarayana. The utsavamurthi, which is a metallic image, represents the deity who is called Shelvapillai, Cheluva Raya and Cheluvanarayana Swamy, whose original name appears to have been Ramapriya (meaning \\"Rama's Favourite\\"). It is believed that this utsavamurthi belonged to and was worshipped by Lord Rama and the kings of the surya vamsa Dynasty for generations. Later the same deity was given to a king of Chandra vamsam (the dynasty of Lord Krishna) and was worshipped by Lord Krishna and many generations. So CheluvaNarayana is so unique that he was worshipped by both Rama and Krishna. According to a legend, this metallic image was lost for many centuries and was recovered by Sri Ramanujacharya. The annual report of the Mysore Archeaelogical Department (p. 57) states, on the strength of epigraphic evidence, that the presiding deity of this temple was already a well-known object of worship before Sri Ramanujacharya worshipped at the shrine, in December 1098, and even before he came to the Mysore region. The temple is richly endowed, having been under the special patronage of the Mysore Rajas, and it has an extremely valuable collection of jewels in its custody. As early as 1614, Maharaja Raja Wodeyar I (1578‚Äì1617) of Mysore, who first acquired Srirangapatna and adopted the Srivaishnava faith, granted to the temple, and to the Brahmins at Melkote as custodians of the deity, the large and valuable estate (fiefdom) granted to him by Vijaynagar emperor Venkatapati Raya. On one of the pillars of the temple's nava-aranga (\\"new stage\\" or pavilion for music and dance performances), there stands a bas relief about high, of Raja Wodeyar, standing with folded hands, with his name inscribed on the base. He is said to have been a great devotee of the presiding deity and a regular visitor to the temple. A gold crown set with precious jewels was presented by him to the temple. This crown is known as the Raja-mudi, after his name. From the inscriptions on some of the gold jewels and on gold and silver vessels in the temple, it is learnt that they were presents from Krishnaraja Wadiyar III (r. 1799-1831) and his queens. Krishnaraja Wodeyar III also presented a crown set with precious jewels. It is known after him as Krishnaraja-mudi. Yet another crown, known as the Vairamudi or Vajramukuta, which is set with diamonds and must have been the most expensive of the three, is also older than both the Raja-mudi and Krishnaraja-mudi. Who was the donor of that very valuable crown, and how it came into the possession of the temple, is unknown. However, as the oldest crown, it has a special place in ritual ceremonies, and has a special annual commemoration named after it, namely the vairamudi habba. Despite all the royal connections of the other two crowns, it is only the old vairamudi to be distinguished this way. All the three crowns are kept in the safe custody of the state government at the Mandya Treasury. They are brought to the temple to adorn the image of Cheluvanarayana Swamy only during a specific annual festival known as Vairamudi habba (literally \\"Diamond crown festival\\"). This festival commemorates, and is named after, the oldest crown, of unknown origin. The Vairamudi festival, which is the chief annual celebration, is attended by more than 400,000 people. Jatra (chariot festival, when the utsava murthy of the deity is taken in procession through the streets of the town) is held annually during March‚ÄìApril and more than one lakh people congregate for this occasion. A number of inscriptions and records of the place speak of other land grants and gifts to this shrine. Perhaps the fort on the hill was built during Hoysala period. The renovated temple has a beautiful gopura.  Important places  Ramanuja Institute Industrial Training Institute There are other shrines of Ramanuja, images of Alvars and Yadugiriammanavaru etc., in the temple. On top of the hill is the impressive temple of Yoganarasimha. Krishnaraja Wodeyar III presented a gold crown to this upper shrine. There is a big pond there. Many more shrines and ponds are located in the town. Melukote has been a centre of learning. It has contributed many literary figures, such as Tirumalarya, Chikkupadhyaya, Alasingachar and Pu. Ti. Narasimhachar. Sri Vedavedantha Bodhini Sanskrit College is one of the oldest institutions here, established in 1854. An old library founded in 1935, contains large number of Sanskrit, Kannada, Tamil and Telugu books and manuscripts. In 1976, opening in 1978, a research institute, the Samskrita Academy was established, which incorporated the library. Yathirajamatha, Ahobalamatha and Parakalamatha of the Srivaishnava sect are located in the place. Melukote has been known for quality handlooms especially weaving dhoties, sarees, etc. An artisans training centre, a dairy unit and a residential school are established in the place. There is a vast forest land near this place and a wild life sanctuary was opened on 17 June 1974, to protect the species like wolves and black buck which are plenty in the area. Karnataka State Gazetteer 1983. Vairamudi Brahmotsava Vairamudi BrahmotsavaA Brahmotsava is a holy cleansing, instigated by or in response to Brahma's example. (Vairamudi Utsav) is an annual spiritual event and festival revered throughout South India. In the past it has attracted up to 400,000 devotees of Lord Cheluva Narayana (Tirunarayana). The main event is the procession of Lord Cheluvanarayana Swamy (as represented by an idol, normally in most srivaishnava temples, the presiding deit \\"moolavar \\" is represented on procession by \\"utsavar \\"in a different name, here Cheluvaraya is called as \\"sampathkumara\\") through the streets of Melkote, which are decorated in his honour. In the procession the Lord's idol is carried on a golden garuda, along with idols representing his divine consorts Sridevi and Bhudevi. The procession takes place at night and continues until dawn. The festival is named for the legendary diamond studded crown, the Vaira Mudi, which the Lord only wears during this procession. For the rest of the festival the Lord wears the Rajamudi, another crown studded with precious stones. According to Hindu legends, Vairamudi, the diamond crown, was stolen from Lord Narayana, when he was asleep at his abode in the Ksheera Sagara (Milky Ocean), by Virochana. Virochana was the king of demons and the son of Prahlada. Garuda was asked by the lord's devotees to bring back the crown. Garuda went after Virochana to the nether world, fought with the demon king and flew back with the crown. According to the legend it is believed that Vairamudi lost its blue gem on the crest while Garuda was bringing it. The blue gem is believed to have fallen near Nachiar Koil, a temple town in Thanjavur district of Tamil Nadu. The gem turned into a stream, called the Manimuttaru, which to this day flows in Thanjavur. On his way, he saw Bala Krishna playing with his friends in the mid day sun at Brindavana. Garuda protected the Bala Krishna from the sun by placing his wings as the shade and placed the crown on his head. The local legends of Melkote claim that Krishna presented Cheluva Narayana with this crown. Preparations for the Brahmotsava start several weeks before the festival. The actual celebrations take place over the course of thirteen days. Garudotsava is celebrated a day before the Brahmotsava at Melkote. The district administration of Mandya makes arrangements for bringing the Vairamudi crown from the Mandya treasury to the temple amidst great security measures. It is believed that the crown must not be exposed to daylight. When not in the procession the priests keep the crown hidden from view in a sacred casket. On the evening of the procession, the crown is placed in front of the sanctum of Sri Acharya Ramanuja and the head priest places the Vaira Mudi and fits it to the statue of the Lord Cheluva Narayana. It is tradition that not even the head priest should look at the Vaira Mudi with naked eyes until it is fitted onto the Lord. Hence the priest covers his eyes with a silk cloth while fitting the crown. During the 13-day celebration, Kalyanotsava, Nagavalli Mahotsava are held in the Holy Kalyani, followed by Maharatotsava. In most years the spiritual events have been accompanied by cultural programmes, including music and dance performances, but in 2014 they were cancelled because of the upcoming election and its \\"model code of conduct\\". While Vairamudi Brahmotsava is one of the most important festivals for Sri Vaishnavas, others include the Garudotsava at Kancheepuram (Tamil Nadu), Kotharotsava at Srirangam (Tamil Nadu) and the Brahmotsava at Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. Yoga-Narasimha Swamy Temple On the top of the hill is an attractive Melkote Narasimha temple dedicated to Lord Yoga Narasimha. It is believed that the image of Yoga Narasimha temple at melkote was installed by Prahlada himself. Krishnaraja Wodeyar III presented a gold crown to Lord Yoga Narasimha. Other attractions  The rayagopura From here visitors can also visit Thondanoor a nearby temple town, the location of the famous Nambi Narayana, Parthasarathi, Yoganarasimha and Ramanuja temples. This is approximately 20 km (12.4 miles) from Melukote. Library and Sanskrit College Melkote is house to the Academy of Sanskrit Research (ASR). Established in 1978, with further history that goes back a few centuries to the times of Ramanuja, ASR is spread over 14 acres at the southern end of Melkote, and contains schools that practice the gurukul system of Sanskrit education as well as those that teach in modern methods, libraries, halls and temples, all dedicated to the study of Sanskrit language and texts. The private library of the Yatirajaswamigalu of Melkote contains a large number of Sanskrit and Kannada works bearing on the Vishishtadvaita school of philosophy, a few works bearing on logic, rhetoric, mathematics, astronomy, astrology, ritual, architecture, Pancharatra, Dharmashastras, Grihya and Dharmasutra. There is also a Sanskrit college here named Sri Veda Vedantha Bodhini Sanskrita Mahapatashala (Govt. Sanskrit College) which was established as early as in 1854 and which is one of the oldest institutions of its kind in the state. Melkote has contributed many literary figures like Pu Ti Narasimhachar, Tirumalaraya, Komanduri Deshika Charyulu ( got Appreciation Certificate also from Mysore Maharaja ), Chikkupadhyaya and Devashikhamani Alasingachar. The academy has also published a number of commentaries on Vedic texts, in English, Kannada and Sanskrit including Sayanacharya's commentaries on the Vedas and Purusha Suktam. Kalyani or Pushkarani Pushkaranani pond The temple infrastructure has a large pond called as Kalyani. The beauty of the steps leading to water and the mantapas built all around are such that it has been captured in many Indian films. Melkote Temple Wildlife Sanctuary Melkote is also the location of the Melkote Temple Wildlife Sanctuary. This sanctuary was created on 17 June 1974, primarily to house wolves. Other mammals found in this sanctuary include the jungle cat, leopard, bonnet macaque, langur and pangolin. It is also an ornithologist's paradise, with around 200 species of birds indigenous to the area. Melkote Temple Wildlife Sanctuary has been known for its once abundant Cycas circinalis species, which in the recent time has been over exploited by the flower decorators and local doctors. Educational institutions The Sri Yadugiri Education center (by Sri Ramanuja Srisha Seva Trust) provides cultural education to rural students. Sri Veda Vedanta Bodhini Govt. Sanskrit college is a place for traditional education. The mission of the institution is \\"Providing good education to rural students\\". Veda, Nalayira Divyaprabandha, Stotra and Grantha Kalakshepams are being taught in traditional families even today. SGS groups runs colleges and schools. SET group runs schools and polytechnics.  Academy of Sanskrit Research  The town is also home to the Academy of Sanskrit Research, an institution that was founded in 1977, by the Government of Karnataka. The Academy has kept 83 employees with 25 research scholars working on Sanskrit Research. Some of the areas of research include: Vishistadhvaitha, Upanishads and Scientific research from ancient texts. There is also a library that houses 11,000 manuscripts and 35,000 books.  ISKCON and Vanaprasta Ashram  Since December 2010, ISKCON has established a Vedic old age home and preaching center at Melkote, near the Travellers bungalow. The ashram houses the deities of Sri Jagannath, Baladeva and Subdradevi. The ashram also has 12 cows where the milk is sent daily for the Abishek of Sri Yoga Narashima Swami. on 12/12/12 ISKCON has registered 2 acres of Land behind Cheluva Narayan Temple. From Akshayatritya 2011, ISKCON has started anadannam at the Yoga Narashima temple for the pilgrims and the needy.

CGE models are also referred to as AGE (applied general equilibrium) models. Overview A CGE model consists of equations describing model variables and a database (usually very detailed) consistent with these model equations. The equations tend to be neo-classical in spirit, often assuming cost-minimizing behaviour by producers, average-cost pricing, and household demands based on optimizing behaviour. However, most CGE models conform only loosely to the theoretical general equilibrium paradigm. For example, they may allow for: # non-market clearing, especially for labour (unemployment) or for commodities (inventories) # imperfect competition (e.g., monopoly pricing) # demands not influenced by price (e.g., government demands) A CGE model database consists of: # tables of transaction values, showing, for example, the value of coal used by the iron industry. Usually the database is presented as an input- output table or as a social accounting matrix (SAM). In either case, it covers the whole economy of a country (or even the whole world), and distinguishes a number of sectors, commodities, primary factors and perhaps types of household. Sectoral coverage ranges from relatively simple representations of capital, labor and intermediates to highly-detailed representations of specific sub-sectors (e.g., the electricity sector in GTAP- Powerhttps://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/Utilities/). # elasticities: dimensionless parameters that capture behavioural response. For example, export demand elasticities specify by how much export volumes might fall if export prices went up. Other elasticities may belong to the constant elasticity of substitution class. Amongst these are Armington elasticities, which show whether products of different countries are close substitutes, and elasticities measuring how easily inputs to production may be substituted for one another. Income elasticity of demand shows how household demands respond to income changes. CGE models are descended from the input-output models pioneered by Wassily Leontief, but assign a more important role to prices. Thus, where Leontief assumed that, say, a fixed amount of labour was required to produce a ton of iron, a CGE model would normally allow wage levels to (negatively) affect labour demands. CGE models derive too from the models for planning the economies of poorer countries constructed (usually by a foreign expert) from 1960 onwards .Manne, AS (1963). Key Sectors of the Mexican Economy, 1960-1970, Studies in Process Analysis, Cowles Foundation Monograph no. 18, John Wiley & Sons. Sandee, J (1960), A Demonstration Planning Model for India, Asia Publishing House, Calcutta. Compared to the Leontief model, development planning models focused more on constraints or shortages‚Äîof skilled labour, capital, or foreign exchange. CGE modelling of richer economies descends from Leif Johansen's 1960Johansen, Leif (1960). A Multi- Sectoral Study of Economic Growth, North-Holland (2nd enlarged edition 1974). MSG model of Norway, and the static model developed by the Cambridge Growth ProjectCambridge Growth Project in the UK. Both models were pragmatic in flavour, and traced variables through time. The Australian MONASH modelDixon, Peter and Maureen Rimmer (2002). Dynamic General Equilibrium Modelling for Forecasting and Policy: a Practical Guide and Documentation of MONASH, North Holland. is a modern representative of this class. Perhaps the first CGE model similar to those of today was that of Taylor and Black (1974).Taylor, L. and S.L. Black (1974), \\"Practical General Equilibrium Estimation of Resources Pulls under Trade Liberalization\\", Journal of International Economics, Vol. 4(1), April, pp. 37‚Äì58. CGE models are useful whenever we wish to estimate the effect of changes in one part of the economy upon the rest. For example, a tax on flour might affect bread prices, the CPI, and hence perhaps wages and employment. They have been used widely to analyse trade policy. More recently, CGE has been a popular way to estimate the economic effects of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. CGE models always contain more variables than equations‚Äîso some variables must be set outside the model. These variables are termed exogenous; the remainder, determined by the model, are called endogenous. The choice of which variables are to be exogenous is called the model closure, and may give rise to controversy. For example, some modelers hold employment and the trade balance fixed; others allow these to vary. Variables defining technology, consumer tastes, and government instruments (such as tax rates) are usually exogenous. Today there are many CGE models of different countries. One of the most well-known CGE models is global: the GTAPHertel, Tom (ed.) (1997). Global Trade Analysis: Modeling and Applications, Cambridge University Press. model of world trade. CGE models are useful to model the economies of countries for which time series data are scarce or not relevant (perhaps because of disturbances such as regime changes). Here, strong, reasonable, assumptions embedded in the model must replace historical evidence. Thus developing economies are often analysed using CGE models, such as those based on the IFPRI template model.L√∂fgren, Hans; Rebecca Lee Harris and Sherman Robinson (2002). A standard Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) in GAMS, Microcomputers in Policy Research, vol.5, International Food Policy Research Institute. Comparative-static and dynamic CGE models Many CGE models are comparative-static: they model the reactions of the economy at only one point in time. For policy analysis, results from such a model are often interpreted as showing the reaction of the economy in some future period to one or a few external shocks or policy changes. That is, the results show the difference (usually reported in percent change form) between two alternative future states (with and without the policy shock). The process of adjustment to the new equilibrium, in particular the reallocation of labor and capital across sectors, usually is not explicitly represented in such a model. In contrast, long-run models focus on adjustments to the underlying resource base when modeling policy changes. This can include dynamic adjustment to the labor supply, adjustments in installed and overall capital stocks, and even adjustment to overall productivity and market structure. There are two broad approaches followed in the policy literature to such long-run adjustment. One involves what is called \\"comparative steady state\\" analysis. Under such an approach, long-run or steady-state closure rules are used, under either forward looking or recursive dynamic behavior, to solve for long-run adjustments. The alternative approach involves explicit modeling of dynamic adjustment paths. These models can seem more realistic, but are more challenging to construct and solve. They require for instance that future changes are predicted for all exogenous variables, not just those affected by a possible policy change. The dynamic elements may arise from partial adjustment processes or from stock/flow accumulation relations: between capital stocks and investment, and between foreign debt and trade deficits. However there is a potential consistency problem because the variables that change from one equilibrium solution to the next are not necessarily consistent with each other during the period of change. The modeling of the path of adjustment may involve forward looking expectations, where agents' expectations depend on the future state of the economy and it is necessary to solve for all periods simultaneously, leading to full multi- period dynamic CGE models. An alternative is recursive dynamics. Recursive- dynamic CGE models are those that can be solved sequentially (one period at a time). They assume that behaviour depends only on current and past states of the economy. Recursive dynamic models where a single period is solved for, comparative steady-state analysis, is a special case of recursive dynamic modeling over what can be multiple periods. Techniques Early CGE models were often solved by a program custom-written for that particular model. Models were expensive to construct and sometimes appeared as a 'black box' to outsiders. Now, most CGE models are formulated and solved using one of the GAMS or GEMPACK software systems. AMPL, Excel and MATLAB are also used. Use of such systems has lowered the cost of entry to CGE modelling; allowed model simulations to be independently replicated; and increased the transparency of the models.

The 1st Battalion embarked at Yarmouth for a seven-month journey to New South Wales, Australia in May 1809.Cannon, p. 24 The battalion's role was to ensure the newly appointed New South Wales Governor Lachlan Macquarie was able to govern after the previously appointed governor William Bligh was deposed by leading members of the New South Wales Corps (102nd Regiment of Foot) in the Rum Rebellion. There in 1810 they received a draft of men from the New South Wales Corps. The 73rd Regiment was under the command of Maurice Charles O'Connell who married Mary Putland, the widowed daughter of William Bligh in May 1810, which created ongoing tension with the leaders of the Rum Rebellion (such as John Macarthur) who were highly influential members of society within New South Wales. To reduce these tensions, the main body of the battalion left New South Wales in April 1814 on the General Hewitt for Ceylon. During the tour in Ceylon the battalion was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Giels, whose children, along with hundreds of wounded men of the regiment, perished in May 1815 in the wreck of the Arniston after visiting him there.Raikes, p. 527 The battalion took part in the Second Kandyan War in Ceylon in 1815.Cannon, p. 28 Following the disbanding of the 2nd Battalion in 1817, some 300 of its remaining soldiers sent out to Trincomalee to join the 1st battalion. In that year the regiment took part in suppressing the Uva Rebellion, losing 412 out of approximately 1,000 men.Powell, p. 320  2nd Battalion  Joseph Cartwright The 2nd Battalion remained in England until May 1813 when it was shipped to Swedish Pomerania and fought at the Battle of the G√∂hrde in September 1813Cannon, p. 45 and the Battle of Merxem in January 1814.Cannon, p. 46 In 1815 the battalion joined Wellington's Army in Belgium: the regiment was in Major-General Colin Halkett's Brigade in Lieutenant General Sir Charles Alten's 3rd Division.Cannon, p. 49 The battalion fought in the Battle of Quatre Bras on 16 June 1815 where they lost 53 men killed and wounded. At the subsequent Battle of Waterloo on 18 June, the regiment was charged by French Cavalry no less than 11 times during the battle and bombarded by French artillery. It remained in square without breaking. The battalion lost 6 officers and 225 men killed and wounded, the second heaviest casualties suffered by a line infantry regiment, after the 1st Battalion 27th (Inniskillings), which lost 450 out of 700 men in holding their square and Wellington's line. The battalion formed part of the Army of Occupation in Paris before moving back to England in December 1815.Cannon, p. 54 = The Victorian era = Thomas Hemy In November 1821 the regiment returned home from Ceylon.Cannon, p. 32 It was posted to Gibraltar in August 1827Cannon, p. 34 and to Nova Scotia in April 1838.Cannon, p. 39 After returning to England in June 1841, the regiment succeeded in having its Highland status restored, in so far as it was re-designated The 73rd (Highland) Regiment of Foot in 1845. In January 1846, the 73rd Highlanders arrived in Argentina to project British interests during the Uruguayan Civil War.Cannon, p. 40 The regiment then sailed on to the Cape Colony to take part in the Seventh Xhosa War. In 1852 a detachment from the regiment departed Simon's Town aboard the troopship HMS Birkenhead bound for Port Elizabeth. At two o'clock in the morning on 28 February 1852, the ship struck rocks at Danger Point, just off Gansbaai. The troops assembled on deck, and allowed the women and children to board the lifeboats first, but then stood firm as the ship sank when told by officers that jumping overboard and swimming to the lifeboats would mostly likely upset those boats and endanger the civilian passengers. 357 men drowned. In 1857 the regiment helped to suppress the Indian Rebellion seeing some action in Central India. In 1862 it received a new title becoming the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot. The regiment was posted to Hong Kong in 1866, back to Ceylon in 1871 and to India in 1874. As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 73rd was linked with the 90th Regiment of Foot (Perthshire Volunteers), and assigned to district no. 60 at Hamilton Barracks. On 1 July 1881 the Childers Reforms came into effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 42nd Regiment of Foot, the regiment they originated from 95 years earlier, to form the Black Watch (Royal Highlanders).

The Hg(SCN)3‚àí ion can also exist independently and is easily generated from the compounds above, amongst others. Its reactions with organic halides yield two products, one with the sulfur bound to the organic compound and one with the nitrogen bound to the organic compound. =Use in chloride analysis= It was discovered that mercury thiocyanate can improve detection limits in the determination of chloride ions in water by UV-visible spectroscopy. This technique was first suggested in 1952 and has been a common method for determination of chloride ions in laboratories worldwide ever since. An automated system was invented in 1964 and then a commercial chloroanalyzer was made available in 1974 by Technicon (Tarrytown, NY, USA). The basic mechanism involves the addition of mercury thiocyanate to a solution with unknown concentration of chloride ions and iron as a reagent. The chloride ions cause the mercury thiocyanate salt to dissociate and the thiocyanate ion to bind Fe(III), which absorbs intensely at 450 nm. This absorption allows for the measurement of concentration of the iron complex. This value allows one to calculate the concentration of chloride. It can be used for determining the concentration of chloride ions in aqueous solution. Mercury thiocyanate without iron (III) is added to a solution with an unknown concentration of chloride ions, forming a complex of the mercury thiocyanate and chloride ion that absorbs light at a 254 nm, allowing more accurate measurements of concentration than the aforementioned technique using iron. Pharaoh's serpent Pharaoh's serpent demonstration Mercury thiocyanate was formerly used in pyrotechnics causing an effect known as the Pharaoh's serpent or Pharaoh's snake. When the compound is in the presence of a strong enough heat source, a rapid, exothermic reaction that produces a large mass of coiling, serpent-like solid is started. An inconspicuous flame, which is often blue but can also be yellow/orange, accompanies the combustion. The resulting solid can range from dark graphite gray to light tan in color with the inside generally much darker than the outside. The reaction has several stages as follows: Igniting mercury thiocyanate causes it to form an insoluble brown mass that is primarily carbon nitride, C3N4. Mercury sulfide and carbon disulfide are also produced. References External links *\\"Pharaoh's snake\\". YouTube.

With sufficiently many steps, the sequence would produce a price vector that clears the market. > Brouwer's Fixed Point theorem states that a continuous mapping of a simplex > into itself has at least one fixed point. This paper describes a numerical > algorithm for approximating, in a sense to be explained below, a fixed point > of such a mapping (Scarf 1967a: 1326). Scarf never built an AGE model, but hinted that ‚Äúthese novel numerical techniques might be useful in assessing consequences for the economy of a change in the economic environment‚Äù (Kehoe et al. 2005, citing Scarf 1967b). His students elaborated the Scarf algorithm into a tool box, where the price vector could be solved for any changes in policies (or exogenous shocks), giving the equilibrium ‚Äòadjustments‚Äô needed for the prices. This method was first used by Shoven and Whalley (1972 and 1973), and then was developed through the 1970s by Scarf‚Äôs students and others.A list of Scarf's students appears in Kehoe et alia (2005: 5): Ph.D. Students: Terje Hansen, Timothy Kehoe, Rolf Mantel, Michael J. Todd, Ludo van der Heyden and John Whalley, and Andrew Feltstein, Ana Matirena-Mantel, Marcus Miller, Donald Richter, Jaime Serra-Puche, John Shoven and John Spencer. Most contemporary applied general equilibrium models are numerical analogs of traditional two-sector general equilibrium models popularized by James Meade, Harry Johnson, Arnold Harberger, and others in the 1950s and 1960s. Earlier analytic work with these models has examined the distortionary effects of taxes, tariffs, and other policies, along with functional incidence questions. More recent applied models, including those discussed here, provide numerical estimates of efficiency and distributional effects within the same framework. Scarf's fixed-point method was a break-through in the mathematics of computation generally, and specifically in optimization and computational economics. Later researchers continued to develop iterative methods for computing fixed-points, both for topological models like Scarf's and for models described by functions with continuous second derivatives or convexity or both.

Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), Philadelphia, PA, 2003. xxvi+388 pp. AGE and CGE models AGE models, being based on Arrow‚ÄìDebreu general equilibrium theory, work in a different manner than CGE models. The model first establishes the existence of equilibrium through the standard Arrow‚ÄìDebreu exposition, then inputs data into all the various sectors, and then applies Scarf‚Äôs algorithm (Scarf 1967a, 1967b and Scarf with Hansen 1973) to solve for a price vector that would clear all markets. This algorithm would narrow down the possible relative prices through a simplex method, which kept reducing the size of the ‚Äònet‚Äô within which possible solutions were found. AGE modelers then consciously choose a cutoff, and set an approximate solution as the net never closed on a unique point through the iteration process. CGE models are based on macro balancing equations, and use an equal number of equations (based on the standard macro balancing equations) and unknowns solvable as simultaneous equations, where exogenous variables are changed outside the model, to give the endogenous results.

He served in the United States House of Representatives and was the state's 38th governor. He was elected three consecutive times, but died early in his third term. He was the state's first foreign-born governor. Early years Frederic Thomas Greenhalge was born in Clitheroe, Lancashire, England, U.K. on July 19, 1842, to William Greenhalgh and Jane (Slater) Greenhalgh.Nesmith, p. 9 He was the only son (of seven children).Nesmith, p. 13 His father, the supervisor of a printing operation, was descended from the Greenhalghs, a family of longstanding note in Lancashire.Nesmith, pp. 6, 9 The family moved first to Eshton and then Edenfield, where the young Greenhalge (who would change the spelling of his name as an adult) attended private school.Nesmith, p. 10 In 1855 the family immigrated to Lowell, Massachusetts, where the father had been offered a job heading the printing department of the Merrimack Manufacturing Company.Nesmith, p. 11 Greenhalge attended the public schools of Lowell, where he excelled academically and participated in debating societies.Nesmith, pp. 14, 19, 26 In 1859, he enrolled in Harvard College, where he was a member of the Institute of 1770 and was well regarded as a debater. He left Harvard after three years because his father died, the family finances having suffered a setback due mill closures caused by the American Civil War.Beauchesne, p. 537 He briefly taught school in Chelmsford, Massachusetts and studied law.Nesmith, pp. 26, 33 In 1863, he sought to enlist in the Union Army, but was rejected on account of poor health. He instead secured a civilian job work as a commissary for the army at New Bern, North Carolina. There he contracted malaria, and was sent home in April 1864. He resumed his study of the law, was admitted to the bar in Lowell in 1865. On October 1, 1872, Greenhalge married Isabella (or Isabel) Nesmith, the daughter of John Nesmith, Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts during the war. They had three children: Nesmith Greenhalge (1873‚Äì1874), Frederic B. Greenhalge (1875‚Äì?), and Harriet Nesmith Greenhalge (1878‚Äì?). Political career Greenhalge served on Lowell's common council in 1868 and 1869. He then became a member of the school committee in 1871, holding that post until 1873. In addition to his legal practice, he also served as a judge in the Lowell Police Court from 1874 to 1884. He was politically a reform-oriented Republican, but supported Horace Greeley in the 1872 presidential election. That year, he also ran unsuccessfully for the Massachusetts Senate as a Democrat. Greenhalge was elected mayor of Lowell in 1880 and 1881 and was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the Massachusetts Senate in 1881. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1884 and a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1885 but was unsuccessful in his bid for reelection. He became city solicitor in 1888, practicing law in Middlesex and other counties. He was elected as a Republican to the Fifty-first Congress, serving from March 4, 1889 to March 3, 1891, but failed in 1890 to be re-elected to Congress, a casualty of that year's Democratic landslide.Hart, p. 5:172 In 1893, Greenhalge ran for Governor of Massachusetts. He was opposed for the Republican nomination by Albert E. Pillsbury, a member of the reform-oriented Mugwump wing of the party. Pillsbury was opposed by the powerful Senator-elect Henry Cabot Lodge, and Greenhalge was chosen as a relatively safe candidate against the Democrat John E. Russell. Russell was not as popular as the outgoing Democratic governor William E. Russell (no relation), and the Democrats were further hurt by the start of the Panic of 1893. Greenhalge won an easy victory. He was the state's first foreign-born governor.Abrams, p. 42 Greenhalge served in the office from January 1894, winning reelection until his death in 1896. While governor, the Commonwealth paid off its last public debt and he proclaimed the first Patriots' Day, ending the 200-year-old Fast Day celebration in Massachusetts.Hart, pp. 5:172-173 Perhaps his greatest test in office came in February 1894 when an angry mob of 5,000 gathered in front of the State House to demand unemployment subsidies; he came out of his office to address them and promise them relief, whereupon their anger subsided. Greenhalge fell ill with kidney disease early into his third term as governor, and died in office on March 5, 1896;Beauchesne, p. 538 businesses and schools closed in his honor. At his funeral Senator Henry Cabot Lodge and Harvard President Charles William Eliot served as pallbearers; he is buried in Lowell Cemetery.

Description In an orphaned SPV, the equity is held by a 3rd party with no legal relationship to the two main parties engaging in the securitisation (the asset user(s), and the lender(s) financing the assets). While this 3rd party legally \\"owns\\" the equity of the SPV, the way in which their ownership is structured gives them no control over the SPV. The driver for orphaning is to enable the securitisation transaction to be held off-balance sheet. If the asset users, or the asset lenders, owned (or legally controlled) the SPV equity, then the SPV would be consolidated into their group accounts. This is something that the lenders to the SPV have to avoid as they are mostly banks and only want to give in loans. Users of the asset may want to avoid if their borrowing limits may have been reached (or they want a regulatory/liability firewall between themselves and the asset(s)). Orphaned SPV structures allow lenders to separate the asset finance, from the asset user(s), thus enabling them to move the asset to other users(s) should the situation arise (e.g. bankruptcy of a user), without having to recreate a new SPV and/or reraise new loans. Orphaning is at the heart of global securitisation transactions, and without orphaning, most securitisation SPVs would cease to be useful or effective to their creators. An orphaned SPV is, by definition, an artificial creation as everybody knows who \\"controls\\" the SPV. There are instances outside of securitisations where orphaned SPVs, and the ability to separate \\"true\\" owners from \\"legal\\" owners, can be used for tax avoidance. For example, restructuring equity into debt, and then relocating this debt to a tax haven via orphaned SPVs, is a classic abuse of orphaning. This is why orphaning is not available in all jurisdictions, and where it is offered in non-tax havens (i.e. where there are domestic taxes), it is strictly controlled and monitored by taxing authorities. Owners The SPV is generally a limited liability company issued in either an offshore location (i.e. the Cayman Islands SPV) or an onshore location (i.e. Irish Section 110 SPV). The key considerations in deciding what 3rd party entities are used to \\"own\\" the orphaned SPV equity are driven by: Given the above, the orphaned SPV equity is usually held by a nominee share trustee company on trust pursuant to a Declaration of Trust (and never via an individual). Specialist law firms provide such trust services (can often be a subsidiary of the law firm advising on the main SPV and/or securitisation transaction). Often only a small number of shares are created for a nominal sum (the exact specific amounts depending on the specifics of the jurisdiction) as the \\"equity\\" of the SPV. These shares are then independently purchased by the 3rd party entity in question using their own funds to complete the purchase (cannot be paid for directly by the main parties). Some jurisdictions have used Charitable Trusts due to their particular robustness to avoiding bankruptcy (not legally possible for it to enter a bankruptcy process), however, this had led to some public concerns over the integrity of the overall orphaned SPV structure (e.g. Matheson in Ireland), and has now been stopped in Ireland. The Non-Charitable Purpose Trust is emerging as a preferred option in some jurisdictions. Abuses The global securitisation market is large (circa US$10 trillion in assets) and involves multinationals getting assets financed by global banks structured in SPVs created by global law and accounting firms. The orphaned SPV structures they use are understood and accepted in many jurisdictions, by regulators and taxing authorities as vehicles in which to conduct global securitisation transactions. Unfortunately, the global acceptance of the main orphaned SPV structures has attracted the attention of users who are not seeking to conduct standard tax-transparent securitisation transactions, but who have other aims and objectives which regulators and tax authorities did not envisage orphaned SPVs being used for. * In 2016, it was discovered that US distressed debt funds used orphaned SPVs, known as Section 110 SPVs, to buy Irish distressed assets during the Irish financial crisis to avoid Irish taxes. By the time the loopholes were closed by the Irish Government, material amounts of tax revenues were lost to the Irish exchequer. * In 2017‚Äì2018, academic research by Professor Jim Stewart in Trinity College Dublin, showed Russian financial entities were using the anonymity of orphaning, as well as the inherent complexity of securitisation transactions, to circumvent various international sanctions in moving money globally. Ireland is the largest EU location for orphaned SPVs, and the above abuses have drawn warnings from the former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland See also *Irish Section 110 SPVs *Purpose Trusts *Bankruptcy Remoteness References Category:Offshore finance Category:Legal entities Category:Types of business entity ","title":"Orphan structure"},{"id":"5063166","text":"Parantica nilgiriensis, the Nilgiri tiger, is a butterfly found in the Western Ghats and Nilgiri Hills of southern India. It belongs to the danaid group of the brush-footed butterflies family. Parantica nilgiriensis is a near- threatened (IUCN 2.3), butterfly endemic to the high altitudes of the Western Ghats of southern India, belonging to the family Nymphalidae and sub-family Danainae. It is restricted to the shola forests, south of Nilgiri Hills, in the temperate zones of the mountains, above 1500 m, though the species occasionally shows up in home gardens and open country to visit flowering plants. It rarely flies as low as 1000 m (Larsen 1987). Though Mark Alexander Wynter-Blyth (1957) mentions it as a common species, it has seen a rapid decline in the density of its population over the last few decades, owing to rapid destruction of its habitats, mostly due to tea-monocultures in the mountain ranges. Species that closely resemble P. nilgiriensis are P. fumata (Butler), a Sri Lankan endemic and P. aglea (Stoll), a common species of low elevations of India, Sri Lanka and other south East Asian countries. Behaviour Egg-laying behaviour: The adult female flies continuously around healthy host plants, occasionally stopping to lay eggs on suitable fresh leaves. It fixes itself on the edge of the leaf using its forelegs, maintaining slow wing beats to keep it alighted, slowly bends its abdomen downwards to lay the egg on the underside of the leaf. It lays several eggs in a session, laid singly, at times with two or more eggs on a single leaf, always maintaining some distance between individual eggs. Adult behaviour: \\"The flight is rapid, low and erratic for a Danaid, giving the impression that it may not be protected species. It is often seen in numbers on flowering trees or on the occasional Lantana in clearings in Sholas. From time to time it is also met with sipping moisture from water seepages in vertical banks in the forest or along clear brooks, something that may also be observed in other montane butterflies.\\" Host plants: Tylophora tenuis and T. indica. It does not seem to feed on Calotropis sp. which its close cousin P. aglea feeds on. Description \\"Upperside fuliginous black with bluish-white markings and spots. Forewing; two streaks in interspace 1, coalescent at base and generally at their apices, a narrow streak, with two faintly indicated streaks above it, in cell; five discal spots and above them a long streak in interspace 5; a shorter one in 6; some coastal spots and subterminal and terminal series of spots, the former series curved inwards opposite apex of wing, the four lower spots conspicuously larger than the others; the latter series incomplete, the spots small. Hind wing: interspaces la, lb, and 1 with narrow streaks, double In the last; the cell with a much broader, outwardly bluntly pointed streak, and beyond this in the interspaces a radiating series of elongate spots with a sub terminal series of smaller spots and a terminal very incomplete series of dots. Underside similar, ground-colour browner, the spots more clearly defined. Antennae black; head and thorax black spotted with white; abdomen brownish above, dusky white below.\\" Wingspan: 80‚Äì90 mm. Both male and female are dull brownish black with dirty white markings above. The streaks are narrower and the spots smaller than those of P. aglea and T. limniace. The markings are much less extensive than the background. Cells are dark with a pale streak. Male has patch of scent scales on the hindwing [Wynter-Blyth 1957]. Eggs: Eggs are white, shiny, dome-shaped and ribbed. Larva: Eggs hatches on the fourth or fifth day. The first instar is a small, pearly white caterpillar with a prominent black head and dark grey legs. It has small paired tubercles on second and twelfth segments, which are precursors of future tentacles. The second instar is larger and begins to show up purplish ground colour with white, oval and round spots similar to what is seen on the mature caterpillar. There are four longitudinal rows of round spots ‚Äì two dorsal and two lateral rows on each side. All the spots in the lateral rows and those on the first two segments and the last three segments are yellow. There is a pair of small tentacles on the second segment and a pair of tubercles on the twelfth segment. In the third and fourth instars the basic morphology remains the same except that the caterpillar grows in length and thickness, the tentacles elongates and the white spots gradually turn yellow on all segments. The fifth instar is about 6‚Äì7 cm long with long, thin, black tentacles on second and twelfth segments, the first pair being longer. In this stage all the white spots of the four longitudinal rows have turned yellow, with dark purple ground colour. The other smaller spots and short streaks remain grayish white. The caterpillar takes 14‚Äì15 days to complete its growth before it prepares for pupation. Larval behaviour: The first and second instars of the larva show the strange behaviour of 'silk diving' ‚Äì the caterpillar simply falls down, when alarmed, and hangs on its own silk thread ‚Äì a protective, predator-avoidance strategy shown by some of the Nymphalids but unknown in any of the danaids. As the caterpillar matures, however, they seldom show this behaviour. (There was no nipping of the midrib before feeding.) Pupa: Pupa is green with shining silvery and black spots. It hangs freely from the underside of a leaf or twig, appearing very similar to that of plain tiger Danaus chrysippus. The duration of pupal stage is 11‚Äì12 days. The pupa begins to show up the pattern of the underlying wings on the eve of eclosion. It turns very dark, nearly black, on the night before hatching. Range Habitat: Southern India; the Nilgiris; Malabar, and Travancore hills.

It is situated on the south bank of the Humber Estuary and west from the Humber Bridge. North Ferriby is directly opposite on the Estuary‚Äôs north bank. Village population was 651 in 2011.ONS data History South Ferriby dates back at least to Roman times when there was a major settlement. It is known locally as one of the 'Low Villages' at the bottom of a chalk escarpment, where the chalk meets the clay to give, before piped water, (the village was one of the first to have piped water with houses plumbing into the supply which was put down to supply steam ships) to the a plentiful water supply. It also marks the point where the Lincolnshire Wolds meet the Humber Estuary and was, as the name suggests,Ekwall, Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, 4th Ed, p 178 the southern end of an ancient ferry over the Humber to North Ferriby. The entry in the Domesday Book of 1086 records a church, a mill and two ferries. To sustain two ferries suggests that a prosperous trading community must have been flourishing at the time. South Ferriby was once two villages, Ferriby Sluice with its strong connection to brick manufacture and other activities on the River Ancholme and South Ferriby with two farms that are still operational. The village has a general store with post office, garage, primary school and two public houses: the Nelthorpe Arms, which has recently been brought back to life in a ¬£370,000 refit in 2018, named after the family who at the beginning of the 19th century owned over half the village (and still have major holdings today), and, down by the Sluice, the Hope and Anchor which looks out over the Humber with Read's Island and its wildlife. The Church of St Nicholas dates to the 13th century; it is a structure consisting of nave, south transept, north porch and an embattled tower with pinnacles at the south-east corner containing 3 bells. Over the porch is tympanum, on which is a sculptured figure of St Nicholas, vested in alb and mitre and holding a pastoral staff in his left hand and on either side are symbolical figures of the Sun and Moon. The unusual north-south alignment of the current church is a legacy of a Victorian enlargements of the church. The Creed and Commandment boards survived in the vestry in the 1990s, and the present pulpit is a surviving element of the 18th century two- or three-decker pulpit dismantled during the 1870s reordering of the church. This was the chancel prior to the 1870s, the nave of the church having been rebuilt almost square following a landslip in the late 16th century. Ferriby Hall is now a private residence once again, having formerly been used as nursing home. Originally a private house until at least the 1960s. In 1953 some contents of the house were lent to Hull Museum on permanent loan. The house was owned in the 1960s by the Booty Family but had to be sold after Leonard Booty, grandson of Frederick Booty absconded with the family inheritance.Ellwood, Stephen (18 February 2016) - Grandson of Leonard Booty The village was badly flooded in the storm surge of December 2013. Geography South Ferriby lies on the route of the Viking Way, the long-distance footpath from the Humber Bridge to Oakham, and is on the side of an escarpment overlooking the Ancholme valley. The A1077 climbs the steep escarpment at this point, and meets the B1204 from the south, which follows the escarpment to Elsham Hall Country Park (former A15 road) via Horkstow. The A1077 is sometimes closed to let boats through the sluice. Transport South Ferriby's closest railway station is Barton-upon-Humber. Trains from here go to Cleethorpes and Grimsby with services being every two hours during the week. South Ferriby is close to the A15 that crosses the River Humber to connect to the A63 to Hull and the M62 motorway. Economy Employment is chiefly in nearby towns, with use of convenient transport links, but with some village home working. The only industry is the cement works. The plant, owned by Cemex (formerly Rugby Cement, and before that Eastwood's Humber Cement), is a prominent landmark in the village, and obtains its raw material from the Middlegate Lane quarry on the hill above.http://www.cementkilns.co.uk/cement_kiln_ferriby.html There is an overhead conveyor belt that passes to the south of the village from the Middlegate Lane quarry to the cement processing works to the south-west over the River Ancholme. In May 2020, Cemex announced its intention to mothball the plant in the autumn of 2020. The company stated that the intended mothballing was not as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, but due to changes in the European market.

The name of the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has a complicated history. Pittsburgh is one of the few U.S. cities or towns to be spelled with an h at the end of a burg suffix, although the spelling Pittsburg was acceptable for many years and was even held as standard by the federal government (but not the city government) from 1891 to 1911.  Etymology  Pittsburgh was named in honor of William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, often referred to as William Pitt the Elder to distinguish him from his son William Pitt the Younger. The suffix burgh is the Scots language and Scottish English cognate of the English language borough, which has other cognates in words and place names in several Indo-European languages. Historically, this morpheme was used in place names to describe a location as being defensible, such as a hill, a fort, or a fortified settlement.  History and spellings  Pittsburgh is spelled without the h in its 1816 city charter. The Pittsburg Dispatch from 1876. The newspaper used the Pittsburg spelling from its second year (1847) to its end of publication in 1923.See, e.g., The Pittsburg Daily Dispatch, 9 August 1847, and The Pittsburg Dispatch, 14 February 1923. The earliest surviving issues, from scattered dates in 1846 and early 1847, include the h in the city's name. Pittsburgh (originally Fort Duquesne) was captured by British forces during the French and Indian War (Seven Years War). The earliest known references to the new name of the settlement are in letters sent from General John Forbes, dated 26 and 27 November 1758, reporting the capture of the fort. In copies of and quotes from those letters in later sources, the name of Pittsburgh is spelled with and without the h, and sometimes with an o before the u. As a Scotsman, General Forbes probably pronounced the name , similar to the pronunciation of \\"Edinburgh\\" as a Scotsman would say it: . The name appeared in print at least as early as 14 December 1758, when the Pennsylvania Gazette published a letter written by a member of Forbes's army from \\"Pittsburgh (formerly Fort Duquesne)\\". For a long time, there was little concern about the spelling of Pittsburgh's name. Early municipal documents and city directories generally spelled the name with a final h, but the letter is notably omitted in the city charter enacted by the state legislature in 1816. The variance in spelling persisted through the 19th century. In 1890, some local newspapers were using the final h and some were not. =Federal board decisions= In 1890, the United States Board on Geographic Names was created to establish uniform place name usage throughout the various departments and agencies of the U.S. government. To guide its standardization efforts, the Board adopted thirteen general principles, one of which was that the final should be dropped from place names ending in -burgh. The Board compiled a report of place name \\"decisions\\" in 1891 in which Pittsburgh's name for federal government purposes was rendered Pittsburg. In support of its decision favoring the Pittsburg spelling, the Board referenced the 1816 city charter. The full decision and rationale from the Board follows: > Pittsburg. Pennsylvania. > The city was chartered in 1816, its name being spelled without the h, and > its official form is still Pittsburg. The h appears to have been added by > the Post-Office Department, and through that action local usage appears to > have become divided. While the majority of local newspapers print it without > the h, certain others use the final h. The Board's decisions were compulsory upon all federal government agencies, including the Post Office. Outside the federal government, the decisions, while clearly influential, were not officially binding. The Pittsburgh city government continued to use the spelling with the h, as did such local institutions as the Pittsburgh Gazette, the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange and the University of Pittsburgh. In 1908, a Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce committee, after conducting a review of historical documents, endorsed Pittsburgh as the correct way to spell the city's name and looked toward getting that spelling federally recognized. Responding to mounting pressure and, in the end, political pressure from senator George T. Oliver, the names board reversed itself and added an h to its spelling of the city on July 19, 1911. The letter sent to Senator Oliver to announce this decision, dated July 20, stated: Relative frequency of Pittsburgh (blue) vs. Pittsburg (red) word forms in English-language books over time, according to Google Ngram Viewer data. Usage of Pittsburg has practically disappeared except in reference to places other than the Pennsylvania city. > Hon. George T. Oliver, United States Senate: > > Sir: At a special meeting of the United States Geographic Board held on > July 19, 1911, the previous decision with regard to the spelling of > Pittsburgh without a final H was reconsidered and the form given below was > adopted: > > Pittsburgh, a city in Pennsylvania (not Pittsburg). > > Very respectfully, > C. S. SLOAN, > Secretary. With the spelling controversy largely settled, the h-less form of the city's name headed toward extinction. There were some holdouts: the city's largest- circulation newspaper, The Pittsburg Press, stuck with the shorter spelling until 1921; The Pittsburg Dispatch and The Pittsburg Leader did so until ceasing publication in 1923.See, e.g., the last issues of The Pittsburg Dispatch and The Pittsburg Leader, both published February 14, 1923. Many cities across the United States named after the city of Pittsburgh, such as Pittsburg, Kansas, Pittsburg, California, and West Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, continue to use the Pittsburg spelling in their names. Other independent municipalities, such as the borough of East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, reflect the modern spelling. = Baseball card = The T-206 Honus Wagner baseball card from 1909 Perhaps the most familiar reference to the Pittsburg spelling is on the renowned 1909 T-206 baseball card of Pittsburgh Pirates legend Honus Wagner. Its scarcity, even at the time, combined with Wagner's reputation as one of the greatest players in baseball history, made it the most valuable sports card of all time, with one pristine specimen yielding $2.8 million at auction. It has been characterized as the \\"Holy Grail\\" of baseball cards. The city name displayed across Wagner's jersey on the card was an artistic addition that did not actually appear on the Pirates' uniforms of the time. The portrait of Wagner makes it appear as if there could be an H on the end, cut off by the border of the picture, but this notion is countered by the appearance of \\"PITTSBURG\\" in the underlying caption and on other Pirate portraits from the T-206 card set. = The -h in Pittsburgh culture = The presence of the -h at the end of the word Pittsburgh is occasionally recognized in Pittsburgh culture. It is often rendered as PGH. For example, Pittsburgh International Airport's abbreviation is PIT, while Union Station's abbreviation is PGH (this is ironic considering that Union Station, which opened in 1903, bears a relief on its rotunda that spells the city's name without the -h). The area's Fox affiliate takes their calls, WPGH-TV from this. A recent playful take on the final -h of Pittsburgh appears in the name of the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority's brand of bottled water: PGH2O, which is a portmanteau of the abbreviation PGH and the chemical name for water, H2O. \\"Da 'Burgh\\" or \\"Da Burgh\\" is a local and affectionate nickname for the city. In homage to the city's history, the \\"Pittsburg Plunge\\" at Kennywood park retains the alternate spelling without the h. See also *Alburgh, Vermont, a town whose name was changed from Alburgh to Alburg in the 19th century, apparently by influence of the same 1891 decision that applied to the spelling of Pittsburgh.

The acting Headteacher is Julie Siddle. It has 765 pupils and 48 teachers. History Archbishop Temple School welcomed its first pupils in September 1963, as a secondary modern school serving the needs of inner city Preston. It was originally named \\"William Temple School\\", after Archbishop William Temple, Archbishop of Canterbury 1940-1944. The school is one of the top 10 non-sixth form schools in England at GCSE and was listed as number 2 in the Sunday Times list of best schools without a sixth form in 2014. The first 'comprehensive' intake (as opposed to 'secondary modern') was in 1967 and followed the closure of Preston grammar school. The headmaster at this time was Mr. Hattersley. Academic success In 2017 90% of pupils left Archbishop Temple School with five or more GCSE qualifications (grades A*-C) including English and Maths. Archbishop Temple School is the highest performing (non selective) school in Lancashire. Ofsted rated the school as ‚ÄúOutstanding‚Äù in 2009. Ofsted again visited the Maths department in 2010 and rated it as ‚ÄúOutstanding‚Äù. In January 2010, the school leadership was inspected, and the then headteacher was appointed as a National Leader of Education (one of only 30 at the time). The school also became a National Support School. In 2013 97% of pupils left the school with a A*-C GCSE grade in Maths. In 2015 the school became a Teaching School, working within the Preston Teaching School Alliance. In 2017 the school was redesignated as a National Support School, and the current Headteacher became a National Leader of Education.

It is situated near the town of Fischbach, in central Luxembourg. History Fischbach has the longest history of any of Luxembourg's castles. The Abbey of Echternach, the wealthiest institution in Luxembourg for centuries, was the first owner of the estate of Fischbach. Records show the first liege independent of the Church took possession of the castle in 1050. The castle underwent several renovations and alterations, including complete destruction in 1635, during the Thirty Years' War. During the second quarter of the 19th century, industrialist and metallurgist Auguste Garnier owned the castle and turned the estate into an industrial centre by constructing blast furnaces there. Grand Duke William II was the first head of state to own the castle in 1847, when he bought the estate to consolidate his political control of Luxembourg and to placate the local populace after the Belgian Revolution. He immediately ordered the demolition of Garnier's blast furnaces. In 1884, Duke Adolphe of Nassau, who would become Grand Duke of Luxembourg when the personal union of the Netherlands and Luxembourg ended in 1890, bought Fischbach Castle from Grand Duke William III. During the Nazi occupation of the Second World War, Fischbach served as a rest home for German artists, calling it K√ºnstlerheim Fischbach. Despite this designation, Fischbach did not avoid the looting of art and historic artefacts that befell other palaces in Luxembourg. However, unlike the other palaces, it was not renovated or partly demolished to suit the Nazis' intentions, leaving it habitable by Grand Duchess Charlotte upon her return from exile. Due to the unsuitability of the other royal palaces, Charlotte continued to live at Fischbach after the war, and took a liking to the place. Even after the full restoration of Berg Castle and the Grand Ducal Palace, Grand Duchess Charlotte lived at Fischbach for the rest of her reign. Indeed, even after she abdicated, in 1964, she remained at Fischbach until her death in 1985. Two years after Charlotte's death, Prince Henri and Princess Maria Teresa moved into the castle, where they lived until Henri succeeded his father, Jean, as Grand Duke, in 2000. Grand Duke Jean lived at Fischbach until his death on 23 April 2019. Hereditary Grand Duke Guillaume and Hereditary Grand Duchess St√©phanie moved into Fischbach Castle in late 2019 upon returning to Luxembourg after living in London for one year.

The lake used to be a gulf of the Aegean Sea until the Classical period, when the sea passage was gradually closed by the alluvial mass brought by B√ºy√ºk Menderes River (historically the Maeander or Meander River). The gulf, and later the lake, was named Latmus in antiquity. The southern shore of the lake is traced by the highway connecting ƒ∞zmir-Ku≈üadasƒ±- S√∂ke to towns such as Milas and Bodrum that are situated in the south. The northern shore of the lake, where steep slopes are covered by wild or semi- domesticated olive trees, is virtually untouched to this day.

At the innermost north-east tip of the lake is the village of Kapƒ±kƒ±rƒ±, as well as the ruins of Heraclea by Latmus (sometimes called Heraclea in Ionia), to distinguish from other ancient Greek sites named Heraclea. The mountain chain of Be≈üparmak (Daƒülarƒ±) -also named (Latmus) in antiquity- rises on the back, sheltering the non-restored ruins of a dozen monasteries dating from the Byzantine era on its slopes.

On the other hand, the changing chemical content and decreasing oxygen amount with the reduction and pollution of the river waters pouring into the lake caused the death of hundreds of thousands of fish and the ecosystem drifting into an irreversible junction. Apart from this, the disconnecting of the B√ºy√ºk Menderes river from the lake, and the fact that the waste of olive oil factories built around the lake continued to be poured into the lake without treatment, has distorted the natural habitat.Hurriyet: Bafa G√∂l√º de kirliliƒüin pen√ßesinde Gallery File:Bafa_G√∂l√º_1.JPG File:Bafa_G√∂l√º_ve_Latmos_Daƒüƒ±.jpg File:Bafa_lake_sunrise.JPG File:Lake_Bafa_(2).JPG File:Lake_Bafa_(3)-ed.jpg See also * Milas * Heraclea (disambiguation) References  External links  Lake Bafa Turkey *Bafa Lake Pictures and Map Bafa Bafa Category:Tourist attractions in Aydƒ±n Province Category:Nature parks in Turkey Category:IUCN Category V Category:Landforms of Aydƒ±n Province Category:Landforms of Muƒüla Province Category:Tourist attractions in Muƒüla Province Category:Important Bird Areas of Turkey ","title":"Lake Bafa"},{"id":"5063227","text":"The Baby Blake was a British cyclecar manufactured by E.G.

Early life and university  Ben Schott was born in North London, England, the son of a neurologist and a nurse. He has one brother, also now a neurologist. He went to school at University College School, Hampstead. Schott went to Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge, where he read Social and Political Sciences. He took a double first in 1996. After Cambridge, Schott got a job at the London advertising agency J. Walter Thompson where he was as an account manager on the Nestl√© Rowntree account working on Smarties, Kit Kat, and Polo. After only four months he resigned to become a freelance photographer.  Photography  Schott worked as a photographer from 1996 to 2003, specialising in portraits of politicians and celebrities. He was commissioned by a range of editorial and commercial clients, including The Independent, The Sunday Times, Sunday Business, Reader's Digest, and the Institute of Directors. A profile in The Times said \\"his subjects included John Prescott, who was rude, and Sir Roy Strong, who had \\"the most wonderful, doleful eyes\\" and told him: ‚ÄúYou must realise I‚Äôm awfully photogenic.‚Äù Tony Blair asked Schott if he'd like to see then-baby Leo; Cherie barked at him not to take too long as they were about to have lunch.\\" His photographic portfolio is online.  Schott's Miscellanies  The idea for the first book originated in some cards that Schott made to send to friends, which contained booklets of what he considered vital but hard to find information. Schott typeset the book himself and had 50 copies privately printed by the Pear Tree Press in Stevenage. After sending copies out to his friends, he sent one to the CEO of Bloomsbury, Nigel Newton. Newton told the Boston Globe, \\"I was completely bowled over when it arrived on my desk. It was a work of striking originality, and it was remarkable to receive an unsolicited submission like this in the mail. I immediately passed it to one of our editors, who signed it up.\\" Schott's Original Miscellany was published with little fanfare, but after an article in the Guardian, in which the book was described as the book as the \\"publishing sensation of the year\\", sales increased, and within weeks Schott's Original Miscellany was at No. 1. Robert McCrum said of the book in The Observer: \\"Originality is like charisma. It's hard to define, but we know it when we find it ... Schott's Original Miscellany is without doubt the oddest, and possibly merriest, title you will come across in a long day's march through the shimmering desert of contemporary publishing\\". Schott followed the Original Miscellany with three sequels: Schott's Food & Drink Miscellany, Schott's Sporting, Gaming, & Idling Miscellany and Schott's Quintessential Miscellany. While the first two were best-sellers (Schott had two books simultaneously in the Sunday Times top ten), sales did not match the success of the first book.  Schott's Almanacs  The first edition of Schott's Almanac was published in Britain in 2005, followed by yearly editions published in Britain, America, and Germany until 2010. The Almanacs shared the same look and feel as the Miscellanies ‚Äì but were substantially longer and larger. Each edition was different, although some content was shared or adapted. The British edition had sections on The World; Society; Media & Celebrity; Music & Movies; Books & Arts; Science & Technology; Parliament & Politics; Form & Faith; The Establishment; Sport; and an Ephemerides section that contains traditional almanac information on dates, moon phases, and the season. The Sunday Times called Schott's Almanac \\"a social barometer of genuine historical value\\"; The Boston Globe called it \\"One of the oddest and most addictively readable reference books in print\\". Schott introduced the 2006 Almanac with a quote from Ben Hecht: \\"Trying to determine what is going on in the world by reading newspapers is like trying to tell the time by watching the second hand of a clock\\". Other works In November 2018 his first novel, Jeeves and the King of Clubs, was published by Little, Brown and Company. It was written as a homage to P. G. Wodehouse, with the blessing of the Wodehouse Estate. Journalism For two years after the publication of the first Miscellany, Schott wrote a weekly miscellany column for The Daily Telegraph, and also produced special miscellany features on Christmas and the Olympics. For over a year he wrote a regular travel miscellany column for the UK edition of Cond√© Nast Traveler magazine. In 2005 and 2006 the Guardian featured special editions of G2 featuring extracts from Schott's Almanac. In 2008 Schott was appointed as a Contributing Columnist for The New York Times OpEd page. He also writes regular features for The Times. Schott publishes a bespoke Miscellany Diary with the society printers Smythson of Bond Street, and a desk-pad diary with Workman. Design His books are noted for specifying the precise design tools (fonts, leading, etc.) that he employs. He has regularly acknowledged the influence of the work of Edward Tufte in influencing the look and feel of his books. In 2004, he won a D&AD; award for the design of Schott's Food & Drink Miscellany.

It is a hygrophobic solid under room temperature. Preparation It can be prepared by treating a potassium-containing base such as potassium hydroxide or potassium carbonate with acetic acid: :CH3COOH + KOH ‚Üí CH3COOK + H2O This sort of reaction is known as an acid-base neutralization reaction. The sesquihydrate in water solution (CH3COOK¬∑1¬ΩH2O) begins to form semihydrate at 41.3 ¬∞C. Applications =Deicing= Potassium acetate can be used as a deicer to remove ice and prevent its formation. It is a substitute for chloride salts such as calcium chloride or magnesium chloride in deicing applications. It offers the advantage of being less aggressive on soils and much less corrosive, and for this reason, is preferred for airport runways. It is, however, more expensive. =Fire extinguishing= Potassium acetate is the extinguishing agent used in Class K fire extinguishers because of its ability to cool and form a crust over burning oils. =Food additive= Potassium acetate is used as a food additive as a preservative and acidity regulator. In the European Union, it is labeled by the E number E261;UK Food Standards Agency: it is also approved for usage in the USAUS Food and Drug Administration: and Australia and New Zealand.Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code Potassium hydrogen diacetate (CAS #) with formula KH(OOCCH3)2 is a related food additive with the same E number as potassium acetate. =Medicine and biochemistry= In medicine, potassium acetate is used as part of replacement protocols in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis because of its ability to break down into bicarbonate and help neutralize the acidotic state. In molecular biology, potassium acetate is used to precipitate dodecyl sulfate (DS) and DS-bound proteins, allowing the removal of proteins from DNA. It is also used as a salt for the ethanol precipitation of DNA. Potassium acetate is used in mixtures applied for tissue preservation, fixation, and mummification. Most museums today use the formaldehyde-based method recommended by Kaiserling in 1897 which contains potassium acetate. For example, Lenin's mummy was soaked in a bath containing potassium acetate. =Use in executions= Potassium acetate was incorrectly used in place of potassium chloride when putting a prisoner to death in Oklahoma in January 2015. In August 2017, the U.S. state of Florida executed Mark James Asay using a combination of etomidate, rocuronium bromide, and potassium acetate. =Industry= Potassium acetate is used as a catalyst in the production of polyurethanes.Hosea Cheung, Robin S. Tanke, G. Paul Torrence \\"Acetic Acid\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. . Historical Potassium acetate was originally used in the preparation of Cadet's fuming liquid, the first organometallic compound produced. Potassium acetate is used as a diuretic and urinary alkaliser and acts by changing the physical properties of the body fluids and by functioning as an alkali after absorption.

It was the largest strike by female American workers up to that date. Led by Clara Lemlich and the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, and supported by the National Women's Trade Union League of America (NWTUL), the strike began in November 1909. In February 1910, the NWTUL settled with the factory owners, gaining improved wages, working conditions, and hours. The end of the strike was followed only a year later by the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire, which exposed the plight of immigrant women working in dangerous and difficult conditions.\\"Sweatshop Tragedy Ignites Fight for Workplace Safety\\" on the American Postal Workers Union website History =Background= During the 20th century American textile workers of all categories‚Äîand female textile workers in particular‚Äîwere subjected to abysmal working conditions, marked by crowded, unsanitary facilities, long work days, and miserable wages. Production in the garment-making capital of New York City during the first decade of the century was split between 600 shops and factories, employing 30,000 workers and producing an estimated $50 million worth of merchandise annually.Tony Michels, \\"Uprising of the 20,000 (1909),\\" in Paula E. Hyman and Deborah Dash Moore (eds.), Jewish Women in America: An Historical Encyclopedia. New York: Routledge, 1997; vol. 2, pp. 1432‚Äì34. Women were frequently trapped by an internal subcontracting system, which made extensive use of home work and additionally limited entry into skilled \\"operator\\" positions by relegating many to the ranks of \\"learners\\"‚Äîa category of convenience which had little correlation to actual level of skill or experience. These so-called \\"learners\\" often earned no more than $3 or $4 a day‚Äîa small fraction of the typical wages of $7 to $12 made by semi-skilled \\"operators,\\" who were generally male. At the top of the garment industry hierarchy were the skilled pattern-makers and cutters, who were almost exclusively male. Garment industry workers often worked in small sweatshops. Work weeks of 65 hours were normal, and in season they might expand to as many as 75 hours. Despite their meager wages, workers were often required to supply their own basic materials, including needles, thread, and sewing machines. Workers could be fined for being late for work or for damaging a garment they were working on. At some worksites, such as the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, steel doors were used to lock in workers so as to prevent workers from taking breaks, and as a result women had to ask permission from supervisors to use the restroom. The industry was dominated by immigrant workers, including prominently Yiddish-speaking Jews, about half of the total, and Italians, who comprised another one-third. About 70% of the workforce was female, about half of whom were under 20 years old. In the production of shirtwaists (blouses) in particular, the workforce was nearly all Jewish women. Some of them had belonged to labour unions in Europe before their immigration; many of the Jewish women in particular had been members of the Bund. Thus, they were no strangers to organized labour or to its tactics. Indeed, Jewish women who worked in the garment industry were among the most vocal and active supporters of women's suffrage in New York. =Strike= alt=A large group of women wearing dark, early 20th century clothing pose for the camera. On November 22, 1909, Clara Lemlich had been listening to men speak about the disadvantages and cautions about the shirtwaist workers going on a general strike. After listening to these men speak for four or more hours at a local 25 union meeting, she rose and declared in Yiddish that she wanted to say a few words of her own. After rising to the podium, she declared that the shirtwaist workers would go on a general strike. Her declaration received a standing ovation and the audience went wild. Clara then took an oath swearing that if she became a traitor to the cause she now voted for, then that the hand she now held high wither from her arm. On the 24th of November, less than one day after the strike had been declared, 15,000 shirtwaist workers walked out of the factories, with more joining the strike the following day. The strike lasted until February 1910 and ended in a \\"Protocol of peace\\" which allowed the strikers to go back to work and met the demands of the workers, which included better pay, shorter hours, and equal treatment of workers who were in the union and workers who were not. =Legacy= The successful strike marked an important benchmark for the American labour movement, and especially for garment industry unions.

There was a lack of available transport, after a large amount had been supplied to Dunsterforce for its advance across Persia, so Marshall persuaded the government to limit the advance to the Tigris Front only. An Anglo-Indian force consisting of the 17th and 18th Indian Divisions and the 7th and 11th Indian Cavalry Brigades, led by Sir Alexander Cobbe, left Baghdad on October 23, 1918.

He held three ministerial positions in the government of Harold Macmillan, during his 11-year tenure as a member of the House of Commons. He also served as President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division (now the Family Division) of High Court for nine years, and was a Law Lord for 6 years before his retirement in 1977. Simon's appointment, as of 2015, marks the last appointment of a former member of the House of Commons as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary (although Reginald Manningham-Buller, 1st Viscount Dilhorne, appointed before Simon but retiring after Simon, was the last serving Law Lord to have previously served in the Commons.) As noted by The Independent in his obituary, \\"Jack Simon was the last of a breed of judges who first pursued a successful career in politics before promotion to the Bench.\\"'Lord Simon of Glaisdale', The Independent, 9 May 2004. Early life Simon was born in Hampstead in London, the son of Claire and Frank Cecil Simon. His father was a stockbroker. He was educated at Gresham's School, in Holt, Norfolk and read English at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He was elected an Honorary Fellow of Trinity Hall in 1963. He was called to the bar at Middle Temple in 1934, and joined the chambers of Tom Denning (later Lord Denning MR), practising mainly in family law and trust law. In the Second World War, he joined the Inns of Court Regiment and was commissioned as an officer in the Royal Tank Regiment. He commanded a special service squadron of three Valentine tanks of the Royal Armoured Corps in the invasion of Madagascar in 1942 and the subsequent six- month campaign to liberate it from Vichy French control. He later fought with the 36th Division in Burma. He was mentioned in dispatches, and ended the war as a lieutenant colonel. He returned to legal practice in 1946, and was appointed King's Counsel in 1951. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving person to have been originally appointed as King's Counsel. Politics Simon's career then took a political turn: at the 1951 general election which returned Winston Churchill to office, he was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Middlesbrough West, winning the seat from Labour. He held the seat for 11 years. Despite continuing his legal practice, he was attentive to constituency matters, and increased his majority in the 1955 general election. Politically, he was a founder of the One Nation Group. He was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Attorney-General, Sir Lionel Heald, for three years, and then held three ministerial positions. He was appointed as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office in 1957. He took charge of the bill that became the Homicide Act 1957, earning the respect of Rab Butler, then Home Secretary. A year later, the ministerial team at the Treasury resigned en masse; Derick Heathcoat-Amory became the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, replacing Peter Thorneycroft and Simon was promoted to become Financial Secretary to the Treasury, replacing Enoch Powell. Simon held this second office for only one year, being appointed Solicitor-General in 1959 to replace Sir Harry Hylton-Foster on his election as Speaker of the House of Commons; meanwhile, Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller was Attorney General. Simon was rewarded on taking this third office with a knighthood, and became a Privy Councillor in 1961. Judiciary Simon seemed destined for a seat in the Cabinet. However, after three years as Solicitor- General, he resigned from his office and his seat in Parliament in 1962, to widespread surprise, to become a High Court judge, and President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division, replacing Lord Merriman. His legal practice at the family bar had prepared him for this position perfectly. The year after taking office, he had an operation to remove a benign tumour. The operation left him paralysed on one side of his face: he had a speech impediment and also lost the use of his right eye; he habitually wore a black eye-patch thereafter, which gave him somewhat of a piratical air. He remained President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division for nine years, until he was created a Life peer as Baron Simon of Glaisdale, of Glaisdale in the North Riding of the County of York on 5 February 1971 and appointed a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary. He retired from judicial office in 1977, but continued to attend the House of Lords and took a close interest in legislation. He sat as a crossbencher in the House of Lords, despite earlier sitting in the House of Commons and holding ministerial office as a Conservative. He was strongly opposed to Henry VIII clauses. He proposed a bill in 1981 to reform the spelling of British English by adopting certain practices from American English, such as replacing \\"-ours\\" endings with \\"-ors\\". Lord-Lieutenancy He was appointed as a Deputy Lieutenant for North Yorkshire in 1973. Family He married his first wife, Gwendolen Evans, in 1934. She died in 1937. He married his second wife, Fay, in 1948; they had three sons. One, Sir Peregrine Simon, also became a barrister and High Court judge.

Built in 1977, the four-lane arched truss span provides a western Ohio River crossing for the Interstate 275 beltway around the Cincinnati area. The section of Interstate 275 on the Cropper bridge is the only Interstate highway in the Cincinnati, Ohio area that goes between Indiana and Kentucky. The bridge is the only highway bridge crossing for west of the Cincinnati downtown area. The Markland Locks and Dam, which carries Indiana State Road 101 and Kentucky Route 1039, is south and west of the Cropper Bridge. History The bridge is named for Judge Carroll Lee Cropper. Cropper became Boone County judge in 1942 and served for the next 20 years. He was born in a farm house near Bullittsburg Baptist Church in 1897 and graduated from Burlington High School in 1916. He served in World War I and after returning settled on his family farm, eventually becoming a cashier at the Boone County Deposit Bank. He served as a state representative for 12 years beginning in 1934. Upon the death of Judge Nathaniel E. Riddell in 1942, Cropper was appointed to finish the unexpired term. The next year he was elected to his first full term. The position Cropper held is the equivalent of today's county judge/executive; prior to voters' approval of the Judicial Reform Amendment to the state constitution in 1975, and its full implementation at the start of 1978, county judges in Kentucky also had judicial powers. During his terms in office, Cropper witnessed Big Bone Lick becoming a state park, development of the airport now known as Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, and the construction of Interstates 71 and 75. It was during Judge Cropper's terms that Boone County began its tremendous population growth. In a Kentucky Post interview in 1974, Cropper said \\"I'm not against progress, but I actually hate to see farms turn into subdivisions. It spoils the nature of the county. A lot of people are going to want to come here.\\" During his 20 years in office, Judge Cropper saw the county increase in population 250 percent from approximately 10,000 to 25,000. A Democrat, Cropper served as Boone County campaign manager for Franklin Roosevelt's first campaign for the presidency in 1932. He also served as chair of the Boone County Democratic Party. Upon his retirement in 1962, Cropper became president of the People's Deposit Bank and five years later chairman of the board. He died in 1976, and is buried along with his wife Kathryn in Bullittsburg Baptist Cemetery. See also   * List of crossings of the Ohio River References Further reading * Caroll C.

The Grand Ducal Palace (, , ) is a palace in Luxembourg City, in southern Luxembourg. It is the official residence of the Grand Duke of Luxembourg, and where he performs most of his duties as head of state of the Grand Duchy. History The building was first the city hall of Luxembourg from 1572 to 1795, the seat of the prefecture of the D√©partement des For√™ts in 1795, and then the headquarters of the Luxembourg Government in 1817.\\"Palais grand-ducal\\", Cour Grand-Ducale de Luxembourg. Retrieved 4 April 2011. From 1817, the palace became the residence of the Governor, the representative of the Dutch Grand Dukes. As such, it was used by Prince Henry, during his time as Lieutenant-Representative of Luxembourg. The building's interior was renovated in 1883, in preparation of a visit by Grand Duke William III and his wife, Grand Duchess Emma. With the accession of the House of Nassau-Weilburg in 1890, the palace was reserved exclusively for the Grand Duke and his family. Under Grand Duke Adolphe, it was comprehensively renovated and a new wing, containing family rooms and guest accommodation, was built by the Belgian architect G√©d√©on Bordiau and the Luxembourgian state architect, Charles Arendt. During the German occupation in the Second World War, the Grand Ducal Palace was used by the Nazis as a concert hall and tavern. Much of the palace's furniture, art collections and jewels were ruined. Large swastika flags were hung down the front. With the return of Grand Duchess Charlotte from exile in 1945, the palace once again became the seat of the Grand Ducal Court. Under the supervision of Charlotte, the palace was redecorated during the 1960s. It was thoroughly restored between 1991 and 1996. The interior of the Palace has been regularly renovated to match modern tastes and standards of comfort. From 1945 to 1966 the Grand Ducal Guard mounted ceremonial guard duties at the palace. From 1966 to today soldiers of the military of Luxembourg perform guard duties. The Palace today As the official residence of the Grand Duke, the palace is used by him in the exercise of his official functions. He and the Grand Duchess, together with their staff, have their offices at the palace, and the state rooms on the first floor are used for a variety of meetings and audiences. On Christmas Eve, the Grand Duke's Christmas message is broadcast from the Yellow Room. Foreign heads of state are accommodated at the palace, as guests of the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess, during official visits to Luxembourg, and the Ballroom is the setting for state banquets in their honour. Throughout the year, numerous other receptions take place at the palace, such as the New Year's reception given for members of the Government and the Chamber of Deputies.

The malt produced here is used mainly by breweries for beer, in distilleries for whisky and for certain foods. The malt house produces basic and special malt products that add natural textures, colours and flavours to breads, foods and beverages. \\"De Zwaan\\" ( \\"The Swan\\") was founded by Jos Buysrogge and Alois Adriaanse on 12 May 1906, originally as a malt house and brewery. 17 years later, the company was sold to Joos Menu, who further expanded the capacity. Between 1939 and 1947, the brewery's activities were impeded when during World War II the copper brew kettles were removed. The brewery closed after the war and malting became the core activity. In the following decades, the facilities and infrastructure were upgraded and improved, including construction of new silos. In the 1960s the malt capacity was 15.000 MT per annum after the plant was further enhanced with the development of a new, more advanced steeping house. The business became a leading Dutch commercial maltster by the end of the decade. In 1972 a new malthouse and a peating installation were constructed, allowing further expansion of the export business. In 1999, Royal Grolsch joined the management team. In 2013, the De Groen family acquired the malthouse in a joint venture with Malteurop, and the plant underwent a minor technology upgrade. The malt house is equipped with the Probat roasting technology, and is equipped with a ceramic bed and scrubber to decrease emission levels. * Total annual capacity: 25,000 MT per annum * Roaster annual capacity: 9000 MT * Barley storage 2400 MT and 12,300 MT in Walsoorden harbour * Malt storage: 5000 MT References External links * The Swaen ‚Äì official website Category:Populated places in Zeeland Category:Hulst ","title":"Kloosterzande"},{"id":"5063358","text":"Robert II (died 1134 or 1137) was the son and successor of Count Robert I of Loritello.

Phil suggests that Johnny be left out of the transaction and Tony agrees. Chris is tremulously told by his girlfriend, Kelli, that she is pregnant. He is thrilled; they get married and buy a large house. On their way home from a trip to Pennsylvania, Chris and Tony stop outside a town because Tony needs to urinate. They see two bikers stealing vintage wine from a liquor store. As the bikers go back into the store, Chris and Tony plunder their wine. They speed away and Chris exchanges gunfire with one of the bikers, wounding him. Exhilarated, Tony and Chris celebrate at a restaurant. Chris decides to break his abstinence when Tony toasts his wedding. Later, as they drink more wine from the bottle in the parking lot, they reminisce about good and bad times, including the day when Chris told Tony about Adriana and the Feds. They say they love each other. On a later night, during the Feast of Elz√©ar of Sabran, Chris pays Corky for the hit on Rusty, partly in heroin. Chris ends up using heroin with Corky, spending the night in a stupor. During the annual Feast, Tony's crew have always managed a 5-day street festival for the benefit, Paulie says, of a non-profit foundation. But a new priest has looked into the finances and tells Paulie and Patsy that their donation to the church should be raised from $10,000 to $50,000. When Paulie refuses to pay, he tells them they will not be permitted to display the traditional golden hat which adorns the statue of the saint. Several parishioners notice that the hat is missing, and word begins to spread that Paulie scrimped on the festival. His penny- pinching is blamed for an accident on a teacup ride that leaves several people injured. Little Paulie is left to deal with the police investigation. Janice and her daughter Domenica are on the ride and unhurt, but Janice pretends to develop a neck injury after hearing Meadow's suggestion that the injured should be compensated monetarily. Janice presses Bobby to get the money. Threatening the ride operator, Bobby learns from him that Paulie refused to pay for a repair crew, or for newer, safer rides. In a public confrontation at the feast, Paulie refuses to compensate Bobby. Tension lingers; Tony instructs Paulie to work things out with him. At the festival Paulie meets Nucci, who says his low spending was not only wrong but sinful; Paulie swears at her and departs, leaving his adoptive mother in tears. At home, he is sleepless. Another source of stress is his fear that he has prostate cancer. Very early the next morning, at the Bada Bing where he has gone for a meeting, he sees a vision of the Virgin Mary. A shaken Paulie visits Nucci at Green Grove that night. He sits quietly next to her on the sofa and they watch The Lawrence Welk Show together. First appearance * Kelli Lombardo Moltisanti: Christopher's new girlfriend. Title reference * The episode's title most directly refers to a faulty amusement ride at the feast, on which Janice, Bobby III, and Domenica were all riding. * Tony spins Domenica around as in a ride. * The title may also refer to the ride to Pennsylvania Tony and Christopher were taking when they stole the wine and bonded. * It may refer to the philosophical \\"thrill ride\\" discussed by Tony and Dr. Melfi - something people are ready to pay their money for and actively seek to temporarily escape their mundane lives. Production * The episode includes a flashback scene of Christopher's emotional revelation to Tony that Adriana had been working for the FBI. That scene was originally shot as part of episode 5.12, \\"Long Term Parking\\" (directed by Tim Van Patten and photographed by Alik Sakharov), but had been cut to heighten the suspense surrounding Adriana's murder. * The feast depicted in the episode and named as the Feast of St. Elz√©ar is based on the annual Feast of St. Gerard, organized every October around the church of St. Lucy's in the Seventh Avenue of Newark, a historical neighborhood of Italian-Americans, which used to be known as the First Ward. In addition to the street procession with the dollar-bill-covered statue of the saint, the feast features light shows, street decorations with colors of the Italian flag, food stands, and music (including an orchestra). David Chase said that he wanted to create an episode about the feast ever since the first season. * Actor Tony Sirico, who plays Paulie, cited the final scene as probably his character's favorite thing to do with his mother as a child, going on to explain that he really has no one else who loves him, which explains Nucci's sudden change in mood and silence. References to prior episodes * Paulie is not able to sleep and anxiously calls his doctor to learn the results of the prostate biopsy at 3 AM. In \\"From Where to Eternity,\\" Christopher, awoken from coma, told Paulie a message from what he claimed to have been the afterlife he visited - \\"three o'clock.\\" Paulie disavowed the Church in that episode. This time, Paulie curses at the statue of Saint Elz√©ar, refuses to pay for its hat to be carried on it during the procession and insults his adoptive mother mentioning sinful deeds until he has a disturbing vision of the Virgin Mary at the Bada Bing!. Other cultural references * Christopher is watching the movie Saw II at the start of the episode. * During the first scene of The Feast of San Elzear, the music playing is from the opera Cavalleria rusticana. * Upon arriving at a house that he is looking at for a potential purchase, Christopher says, \\"This is what I'm talking about, stately Wayne Manor\\" (the residence of Bruce Wayne). * Following Tony and Christopher's heist of the wine (and again when Tony unloads the wine in his basement), Christopher comments that one of the bikers, with scraggly hair and a full mustache and beard, looked like \\"Grizzly Adams,\\" a famed 19th Century mountaineer, later made popular as the title character in the 1977‚Äì1978 NBC television series The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams. * The wine Chris and Tony steal is 1986 Ch√¢teau Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande. * The episode uses a reference to Hurricane Katrina. Tony runs into Paulie in the bathroom and says \\"you're doing a heck of a job there, Brownie,\\" a reference to a similar statement made by George W. Bush to then- Federal Emergency Management Agency director Michael Brown. Bush's comment is often used to sarcastically praise someone who is doing a poor job. * Christopher calls Tony \\"The Bad Lieutenant.\\" The film of that name is a 1992 Abel Ferrara tale full of religious undertones and Catholic iconography similar to this episode. In the film, the unnamed Lieutenant sees a vision of Christ just as Paulie sees a vision of the Virgin Mary at the Bada Bing!. * When Tony denies Christopher killed Adriana, he mentions O.J. Simpson and Scott Peterson to Carmela as examples of a lethal domestic violence case. Music * The song playing in the background at the Bada Bing! while Christopher announces his marriage is \\"Flash and Crash\\" by 1960s Seattle garage rock band Rocky & The Riddlers. * The music playing while Christopher and Tony are driving and stealing wine is \\"All Right Now\\" by British rock band Free. * The song briefly heard while Christopher and Tony are driving home is \\"Midnight Rider\\" by Buddy Miles. * The song playing throughout Christopher's high is \\"The Dolphins\\" by folk artist Fred Neil. * The song played when Tony Soprano and Phil Leotardo meet at the feast is \\"A Chi\\" by Italian singer Fausto Leali. The song is played again at the end of the episode when Tony and Carmela join the Baccalieris at the feast. * The song played when Tony Soprano lifts his niece and spins her around is \\"Red River Rock\\" by Johnny & The Hurricanes. * The polka played on accordion by Myron Floren on The Lawrence Welk Show during Paulie's visit to Nucci is the Norwegian children's song \\"Hompetitten\\" (presented as \\"Johnny Oslo Schottische\\").

Synopsis At the climax of a fight between the Justice League and a giant robot remote-controlled by Lex Luthor, it falls over, threatening to crush Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, and J'onn J'onzz. The Flash tries to stop the damaged robot falling onto the other Leaguers by running so fast that he creates a tornado-like vortex just as the robot's energy core explodes. This causes the four heroes to accidentally be sent to a parallel Earth existing in a different vibrational frequency from the Justice League's own. They end up in Seaboard City, an idyllic 1950s locale that evokes the traits of Pleasantville or other such havens and features an ice cream van which plays \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\", a tune regularly employed on that show. There, they meet the Justice Guild of America members Tom Turbine, The Streak, the Green Guardsman (not to be confused with Green Guardsman of Amalgam Comics), Black Siren, Catman, and their sidekick / mascot Ray Thompson. They first fight when Green Lantern and Flash stop a robbery by Justice Guild enemy Music Master and the Guild mistakes them for the thieves. After the Streak sees Flash save Ray from pieces of a falling building, he realizes the League aren't criminals and stops the fight. The Justice Guild were comic book characters on the Justice League's Earth about whom Green Lantern read as a child. He claims without the comics, he may not have the ring today, as the comics taught him to be a hero. J'onn J'onzz hypothesizes that the JGA writers were psychically tuned in to their Earth during flashes of \\"inspiration\\"; this is a nod to the explanation Gardner Fox provided for the JSA/JLA link in his September 1961 story Flash of Two Worlds in which the Barry Allen Flash of Earth-One encounters Jay Garrick, his Earth-Two counterpart. They help the JGA fight a group of their enemies called the Injustice Guild of America, who are based on Golden Age DC supervillains, which consists of Music Master, Sportsman, Sir Swami, and Doctor Blizzard after they were given a letter by Sergeant O'Shaughnessey and his unnamed partner. The IGA engage in a scheme to pull off a series of crimes based on the four elements of earth, air, water, and fire as part of a contest to see which of them can pull off the best crime related to those elements, and by doing so will lead the IGA in their next criminal activity. Doctor Blizzard wins when he takes Flash and Black Siren as hostages, and he leads the IGA in robbing the Seaboard City Mint and escaping by blimp. The IGA are defeated by the JL and the JGA and are handed over to the police. Meanwhile, Hawkgirl discovers graves of the JGA covered in vines, prompting her and Lantern to probe deeper into inconsistencies found in the \\"perfect\\" Seaboard City, such as how some, if not all dangers in it happen to come from out of nowhere (A question from Flash even correctly suggests that Sergeant O'Shaughnessy and his partner are the only two police officers in the entire city). The two question the driver of the ice cream truck, constantly driving around, about their suspicions, but he only responds to their questions with unspecific answers including about the last time he ever actually sold any ice cream. He can only say that \\"he\\" might hear them before driving away. They go to a library, where they discover the books on the shelves have blank pages, and going to the basement, they find a brick wall behind the basement door. After Hawkgirl smashes through it, they find a battle-scarred subway tunnel, and an old newspaper (dated on the same day as the final Justice Guild comic). The newspaper's articles reveal to them the JGA world's version of the Cuban Missile Crisis had escalated into World War III, with the heroes all perishing in the resultant U.S.-Soviet nuclear exchange, and Seaboard City being destroyed by the ensuing nuclear holocaust: the deaths of the JGA was the cause of the Justice Guild comic book being cancelled in the Justice League‚Äôs world. Hawkgirl and Lantern show this knowledge to Flash, J'onn and the JGA; shocked, the JGA deny that their existence is nothing more than an illusion. J'onn suspects Ray Thompson is the key to the bizarre state of this reality. Ray denies knowing anything, but J'onn makes a telepathic link with him, causing him to reveal his true form: a disfigured mutant with the ability to warp reality and create psychic illusions. Ray's abilities were activated by the holocaust, and he created the false time warp the city is in as a consequence of their manifestation. With a distorted and nostalgic view of the past, he recreated the world of his childhood and resurrected the heroes he worshiped as a child. Angrily, Ray goes on a rampage and tries to kill the JL, while distracting the JGA with a giant red robot. The Guild heroes are initially unsure of what they should do, realizing the only chance they have of saving the JL and stopping Ray is by defeating him, which will undo the illusion and everything within it, including themselves. They eventually decide they can forfeit their false lives to do this, reasoning if they could sacrifice themselves to save their world once, they can do so again. They all attack Ray, overwhelming his mind and shattering the illusion. Lantern then watches in dismay as the JGA fade away with smiles on their faces. The Mayor of Seaboard City, Sergeant O'Shaughnessy, his partner, the ice cream man, and all of the other civilians are freed from the illusion. The ice cream man stated that war destroyed their world and now they have the opportunity to begin to rebuild their shattered world starting with Seaboard City as the civilians thank the League for giving them a future. The Justice League members return to their own Earth using a space-time machine Tom Turbine was working on before his death, powered by Green Lantern's ring. Back on his own Earth, John Stewart ponders of how much the JGA comics meant to him when he was young and the impact the comics' cancellation in 1962 (the year the actual Guild died) had on him. He remarks to Hawkgirl that the JGA taught him the meaning of the word hero, a commentary on the bright, optimistic Golden and Silver Age's contrast to the Bronze and Modern Age's grittiness and angst. Members Among the members of the Justice Guild are: * Streak (voiced by David Naughton) ‚Äî The leader of the Guild who possesses super-speed and wears a football helmet. * Cat Man (voiced by Stephen Root) ‚Äî A cat-themed member of the Guild who is a master martial artist. He is often paired up on missions with Black Siren (with whom he also apparently shares a romantic relationship). Cat Man has a Cat-Cycle and sidecar, and possesses a grappling hook and gauntlets with retractable claws. * Green Guardsman (voiced by William Katt) ‚Äî He wields a power ring which can create a variety of hard- light constructs. His ring is ineffective against anything associated with aluminum. * Tom Turbine (voiced by Ted McGinley) ‚Äî The team's brains, he is a genius intellect specializing in nuclear physics and meta-physics. Tom also has a mesomorphic build, making him naturally very strong as well. He possesses a belt containing an advanced flat, circular push-button-activated turbine and thick ring-like metal wristlets and anklets. When the turbine that powers the wristlets and anklets is turned on, it grants him flight and super- strength. It presumably also imbues him with great speed and agility, but not as fast as The Streak or as agile as Cat Man. * Black Siren (voiced by Jennifer Hale) ‚Äî The only female member of the Justice Guild, while on a team of all males, she takes it upon herself to handle the household chores and duties. She is often paired with Cat Man on missions and it is implied that they are also romantically engaged. * Ray Thompson (voiced by Neil Patrick Harris) ‚Äî The team's mascot. After the Justice Guild died during a nuclear war that destroyed his own world, Ray survived and became exposed to the radioactive fallout that mutated his DNA, giving him the psychic ability to mold the world to one of his own choosing. Using his new powers, Ray chose to recreate what he had lost along with the heroes he grew fond of as a child. When the Justice Guild found out their existence was a fake, they fought back and overcame Ray's powers, undoing the illusion and everything in it. Injustice Guild A group of super-villains whose goal is to eliminate the Justice Guild and rule the world. They make their headquarters in a cave somewhere outside of Seaboard City. Among its members are: * Sir Swami (voiced by Jeffrey Jones) ‚Äî The leader of the Injustice Guild. He is a turban-wearing magician with limitless powers that comes from his magic wand. Swami proposed a contest to see who can pull off the perfect crime related to the four elements of nature. He tried to steal a jewel related to fire (Streak identified it as the \\"Flame of Rasputin\\") but was stopped by Green Lantern and Streak. He escaped through a phone booth. He later assisted Dr. Blizzard in his scheme which also ended in failure. It is unknown if he is a projection of Ray's mind or a real person or if he survived the nuclear war. * Music Master (voiced by Udo Kier) ‚Äî A member of the Injustice Guild. He possesses an accordion that emits high intensity sound waves. He was the first member of the Injustice Guild to encounter the Justice League. He tried to steal a priceless instrument, but was thwarted by the League. He escaped and told the rest of the Injustice Guild about the new heroes. When Sir Swami proposed a contest to see who could pull off a crime related to the four elements, Music Master chose air and stole a replica of the Wright Brothers' glider plane. Hawkgirl and Green Guardsman gave chase but couldn't damage the plane. Music Master got away with the plane but lost the contest to Dr. Blizzard. He was eventually defeated by both The Justice League and Guild. It is unknown if he survived the war or if he's a projection of Ray's mind. * Sportsman (voiced by Michael McKean) ‚Äî A member of the Injustice Guild who uses sports equipment to commit crimes. His mannerisms mirror those of Bob Hope. When Sir Swami proposed a contest to see who could pull off a crime related to the four elements, Sportsman chose earth and stole a tennis trophy. He escapes capture by J'onn Jonnz, Cat Man, and Ray Thompson. He is eventually defeated by both the Justice League and Guild. It is unknown if he survived the war or if he's a projection of Ray's mind. * Doctor Blizzard (voiced by Corey Burton) ‚Äî A member of the Injustice Guild. He possesses a special doctor's light-reflector that gives him ice ray powers and also makes cheesy ice puns. When Sir Swami proposed a contest to see who could pull off a crime related to the four elements, Doctor Blizzard chose water and planned to steal a new fountain during its dedication by the Mayor of Seaboard City. Flash and Black Siren intervened, but Doctor Blizzard froze them and took them to his hideout where he won the contest. Since he won, he got to pick their next move. He chose to rob the Seaboard City mint, then escape by blimp with help from his teammates. Cat Man single-handedly took down the entire Injustice Guild and foiled their plot. It is unknown if he survived the war or if he's a projection of Ray's mind. * Ray Thompson he has a young boy form and later he is an evil mutant in his real form. Homages * Bruce Timm has commented that Ray Thompson is based on both Roy Thomas, who collaborated on the animated series, due to his famous admiration of the Golden Age comics, and science-fiction writer Ray Bradbury, because many of Bradbury's stories deal with nostalgia compared to the harshness of the present. * The idea of Ray's special ability is based on Marvel Comics' Rick Jones summoning the Golden Age heroes in the Avengers' Kree-Skrull War, a story written by Roy Thomas. * The Justice League staff originally intended to use the Golden Age Justice Society of America, but access to the characters was denied by DC Comics as Paul Levitz felt the story as written disrespected the JSA and the characters' portrayals clashed with the post-Crisis JSA's portrayal in current comics. However, Levitz agreed to a compromise: the producers could change the names and designs just enough to make the team not quite the JSA, but still get the point across.Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #102  Comics Should Be Good! @ Comic Book Resources * Members of the Justice Guild were intended to reflect:  The Streak resembles the Golden Age Flash. His role as leader of the Justice Guild mirrors the Flash's role as the first chairman of the Justice Society.  Tom Turbine is a homage to the Golden Age Atom, possessing his short stature, overall color scheme, similar belt and also their profession, with the Atom being a genius physics professor at Calvin College and Tom Turbine being a physicist himself. Tom Turbine's energetically charged punches pay homage to The Atom's own Atomic Punch, a power he acquired later into his career. The alliteration of Tom Turbine's name is also an homage to 'Atom Al', the nickname used to bully Al Pratt for his stature and which inspired his Atom moniker. Turbine also shares some of the Golden Age Superman's facial features.  Green Guardsman resembles the Golden Age Green Lantern, with his ring not working on anything associated with aluminium is an homage to Alan Scott's ring not working on anything associated with wood. His alter ego is given as Scott Mason.  Catman is a combination of Wildcat and Golden Age Batman with the personality of Adam West's version of Batman from the 1960s live-action TV series. He is not to be confused with the Batman villain of the same name, whose alter ego was Thomas Blake. However, the real name of the Justice Guild of America's Catman is T. Blake which is an homage to the Batman villain.  Black Siren resembles the Golden Age Black Canary. The name given on her tombstone, Donna Vance, is similar to that of the original Black Canary Dinah Drake Lance. * JGA enemies the Injustice Guild were modified versions of the Injustice Society:  The Music Master is a homage to the Fiddler.  The Sportsman is a homage to the Sportsmaster.  Dr. Blizzard is a homage to the original Icicle.  Sir Swami is a homage to the Wizard. * The episode ends with \\"Respectfully dedicated to the memory of Gardner F. Fox.\\" Gardner Fox was a prominent writer of both the Golden and Silver Age era and co-created both the JSA and the JLA. Fox was also the creator of the concept of the DC Multiverse, and author of the first comic to feature the Multiverse, Flash #123, \\"The Flash of Two Worlds\\". This is among the DCAU episodes that pay homage to those writers, another being Superman: The Animated Series episode \\"Apokolips... Now!\\" which was dedicated to Jack Kirby. In other media =Arrowverse= Elements of this concept are seen within the Arrowverse: * Barry Allen (Grant Gustin) was initially coined \\"The Streak\\" by Iris West in The Flash early in season one before officially being given The Flash codename. * The Earth-Two metahuman version of Dinah Laurel Lance (Katie Cassidy) uses the \\"Black Siren\\" alias in The Flash and Arrow.

Joginder Singh married Bibi Gurdyal Kaur Banga, who was from a Saini family in the village Kothay Rara Singh, near Kotkapura. He went to primary school in Nathu Ala village and went to middle school in Daroli village. He decided to join the army, considering that it would give him an \\"identity and purpose\\".  Military career  On joining the British Indian Army, Singh was posted to the 1st battalion of the Sikh Regiment (1 Sikh) on 28 September 1936. After joining the army, he identified his interest in education, and soon passed the Army Education Examination. He was subsequently appointed as the Unit Education Instructor. He served in the Second World War on the Burma front, and in Srinagar during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947‚Äì1948. =Sino-India War= There had long been disagreement between India and China over disputed borders in the Himalaya region. To counter the increasing Chinese intrusions into disputed territory, then Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru asked for strategies for dealing with them. However, the proposal put forward by the Indian Army was rejected. Instead, he approved a plan proposed by a bureaucrat called the \\"Forward Policy\\". This called for the establishment of a number of small posts facing the Chinese. Due to the severe rise in public criticism against Chinese intrusions, Nehru implemented the \\"Forward Policy\\" against the advice of the army. The army's concern was that the Chinese had geographical advantage. Additionally, maintaining numerous small posts would be untenable if the Chinese superior forces attacked. This was ruled out by Nehru who believed the Chinese would not attack. But the Chinese did, initiating the Sino-India War. Battle at Bum La On 9 September 1962, then Defence Minister of India Krishna Menon made a decision to evict the Chinese troops south of Thala Ridge. This decision was endorsed by Nehru, who was in London to attend the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. Subsequently, the 7th Infantry Brigade, which included 1 Sikh, was ordered to move to Namka Chu, which was considered as militarily unsound and an advantageous ground for the Chinese. This move was strongly criticized by the Indian media, who publicized it with \\"sensational headlines\\", arguing India's military offensive capability. The Chinese, aware of these developments, attacked the unprepared Indian post at Namka Chu. Though the Indian troops resisted the attack, they took heavy casualties due to inadequate ammunition and weak communication lines. Soon after the attack, the Chinese advanced to Tawang. Midway they encountered an Indian post at the Bum La Pass, held by a platoon of 20 men from 1 Sikh. The post was under the command of Singh, now a subedar. The Chinese attacked the post in three waves, each comprising 200 men. Though the initial two attacks were repelled successfully, by that time, the platoon was depleted to half of its original strength. Singh was also wounded, but refused evacuation. Soon the ammunition was exhausted, and the survivors were only left with their bayonets. The Sikh soldiers then charged towards the Chinese, shouting the war cry Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh. The Chinese lines were scattered at this sight and many were bayoneted. Due to heavy numbers and superior weapons, the Chinese were able to withstand the last charge by Singh and his remaining soldiers. Before Singh was overpowered and captured by the Chinese, he single-handedly killed several Chinese soldiers with his bayonet.

Daidzein and other isoflavones are produced in plants through the phenylpropanoid pathway of secondary metabolism and are used as signal carriers, and defense responses to pathogenic attacks.Jung W, Yu O, Lau SMC, O‚ÄôKeefe DP, Odell J, Fader G, McGonigle B.

In humans, recent research has shown the viability of using daidzein in medicine for menopausal relief, osteoporosis, blood cholesterol, and lowering the risk of some hormone-related cancers, and heart disease. Natural occurrence Daidzein and other isoflavone compounds, such as genistein, are present in a number of plants and herbs like Kwao Krua (Pueraria mirifica) and Kudzu (Pueraria lobata). It can also be found in Maackia amurensis cell cultures.Isoflavonoid production by callus cultures of Maackia amurensis.

Biosynthesis  =History= The isoflavonoid pathway has long been studied because of its prevalence in a wide variety of plant species, including as pigmentation in many flowers, as well as serving as signals in plants and microbes. The isoflavone synthase (IFS) enzyme was suggested to be a P-450 oxygenase family, and this was confirmed by Shinichi Ayabe‚Äôs laboratory in 1999. IFS exists in two isoforms that can use both liquiritigenin and naringenin to give daidzein and genistein respectively.Winkel-Shirley, Brenda. (1 June 2001) Flavonoid biosynthesis. A Colorful Model for Genetics, Biochemistry, Cell Biology, and Biotechnology. Plant Physiology 126:485‚Äì493. =Pathway= Daidzein is an isoflavonoid derived from the shikimate pathway that forms an oxygen containing heterocycle through a cytochrome P-450-dependent enzyme that is NADPH dependent. The biosynthesis of daidzein begins with L-phenylalanine and undergoes a general phenylpropanoid pathway where the shikimate derived aromatic ring is shifted to the adjacent carbon of the heterocycle.Dewick, Paul M. (4 February 2009). Medicinal Natural Products: A Biosynthetic Approach, 3rd Edition. Wiley Online Library: Wiley. pp 137‚Äì175. . Retrieved 1 June 2017. The process begins with phenylalanine ligase (PAL) cleaving the amino group from L-Phe forming the unsaturated carboxylic acid, cinnamic acid. Cinnamic acid is then hydroxylated by membrane protein cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H) to form p-coumaric acid. P-coumaric acid then acts as the starter unit which gets loaded with coenzyme A by 4-coumaroyl:CoA- ligase (4CL). The starter unit (A) then undergoes three iterations of malonyl- CoA resulting in (B), which enzymes chalcone synthase (CHS) and chalcone reductase (CHR) modify to obtain trihydroxychalcone. CHR is NADPH dependent. Chalcone isomerase (CHI) then isomerizes trihydroxychalcone to liquiritigenin, the precursor to daidzein. A radical mechanism has been proposed in order to obtain daidzein from liquiritigenin, where an iron-containing enzyme, as well as NADPH and oxygen cofactors are used by a 2-hydroxyisoflavone synthase to oxidize liquiritigenin to a radical intermediate (C). A 1,2 aryl migration follows to form (D), which is subsequently oxidized to (E). Lastly, dehydration of the hydroxy group on C2 occurs through 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase to give daidzein. Proposed daidzein biosynthesis Research Daidzein has been found to act as an agonist of the GPER (GPR30).

Retrieved 13 September 2019 It was an instant hit with the live audience, which demanded four repeats that night. Eventually the instrumental came to the attention of record producer Archie Bleyer of Cadence Records, who hated it, particularly after Wray poked holes in his amplifier's speakers to make the recording sound more like the live version. But Bleyer's stepdaughter loved it, so he released it despite his misgivings. Phil Everly heard it and suggested the title \\"Rumble\\", as it had a rough sound and said it sounded like a street fight. It was banned in several US radio markets because the term 'rumble' was a slang term for a gang fight and it was feared that the piece's harsh sound glorified juvenile delinquency. It became a hit in the United States, where it climbed to number 16 on the charts in the summer of 1958. Bob Dylan once referred to it as \\"the best instrumental ever\\". The Dave Clark Five covered it in 1964 on their first album, A Session with The Dave Clark Five; it also appeared on their second American album, The Dave Clark Five Return!. Another recording of the instrumental was released by Wray in 1968 as \\"Rumble '68\\", and again in 1969 as \\"Rumble-69\\" (Mr. G Records, G-820).

Biography He was born on 26 November 1855 (according to church records, 1853 according to his own writings) on a manor near Vologda where his father, a Novgorodian, worked as an assistant to the manor's bailiff, a Zaporozhian Cossack whose daughter he later married. Gilyarovsky treasured his partly Cossack descent: as a young man, he posed for one of the Cossacks depicted on Repin's huge canvas Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks; he was also a model for Taras Bulba, whose figure is part of the Gogol Monument in Moscow. Raised by his well-educated mother (who died when he was 8) and his aristocratic stepmother, he left home early and, after a series of odd jobs (which included stints at a toxic lead paint factory in Yaroslavl, as a tutor and as a barge hauler), he enlisted as a volunteer during the 1877‚Äì78 Russo-Turkish war. After a short career as a provincial actor, he established himself as a journalist, winning praise and notoriety as one of the best crime reporters in Moscow. His first book, The Stories of the Slums (1887) recorded his experiences with the Moscow underworld, the Moscow of poverty and crime, finding its epitome in the area of Khitrovka. After the revolution he dedicated himself to writing memoirs. Among those were My Travels (1928) and Newspaper Moscow (published posthumously), which recorded his reminiscences of the newspaper business of pre-revolutionary Moscow and of some famous people he'd worked with (such as Anton Chekhov), and Theatre People (also published posthumously).

The plan envisioned the transport of IRA Chief of Staff Se√°n Russell to Ireland, and on the arrival of Frank Ryan in Berlin three days before the launch of the operation, it was also decided to transport him during the operation. Russell's arrival and activities in Germany Se√°n Russell had arrived in Berlin on 5 May 1940, four days after arriving in Genoa from the United States.While it is true to say Russell was the IRA Chief of Staff at the time, he had delegated the responsibility to Stephen Hayes, whose official title in the organisation was now Acting Chief of Staff. Unknown to Russell, Hayes was actually representing himself to the Germans via his emissary for Plan Kathleen as full IRA Chief of Staff. While the Germans took Russell seriously, his reputation with them suffered over time ‚Äî in so far as it was ever considered. Russell was informed of Operation Mainau, the plan to parachute Dr. Hermann G√∂rtz into Ireland. Russell was asked to brief G√∂rtz on Ireland before his departure that night, but missed his takeoff from the Fritzlar airfield near Kassel. By 20 May, Russell had begun training with Abwehr in the use of the latest German explosive ordnance. This training was conducted at the Abwehr training school/lab in Berlin-Tegel, which specialised in the design of explosives as everyday objects. Russell also visited the training area for the Brandenburg Regiment, the 'Quenzgut,' where he observed trainees and instructors working with sabotage materials in a field environment. Because he received explosives training, his return to Ireland with a definite sabotage objective was planned by German Intelligence. His total training time with German Intelligence lasted over three months. Immediate context While G√∂rtz had landed successfully, the capture of the German agents from Operation Lobster I did not prevent Abwehr chief Wilhelm Canaris allowing the transport of Russell to continue.

North Seymour () is a small island near Baltra Island in the Gal√°pagos Islands. It was formed by uplift of a submarine lava formation. The whole island is covered with low, bushy vegetation. The island is named after an English nobleman, Lord Hugh Seymour. North Seymour Island has an area of and a maximum altitude of . This island is home to a large population of blue- footed boobies and swallow-tailed gulls. It hosts one of the largest populations of magnificent frigatebirds (Fregata magnificens) and a slowly growing population of Gal√°pagos land iguanas (Conolophus subcristatus). North Seymour has a visitor trail approximately in length crossing the inland of the island and exploring the rocky coast. The stock for the captive breeding program of the Gal√°pagos land iguana is descended from iguanas which Captain G. Allan Hancock translocated from nearby Baltra Island to North Seymour Island in the 1930s. This was very important because Baltra Island had a U.S airbase on it during World War II, while North Seymour, which has no people who live on it, and is only viewable today with an official guide who works for the Gal√°pagos National Park. North Seymour was created by seismic uplift, rather than being of volcanic origin. The island has a flat profile with cliffs only a few meters from the shoreline, where swallowtail gulls and tropicbirds sit perched in ledges. A tiny forest of silver-grey Palo Santo trees stand just above the landing, usually without leaves, waiting for rain to bring them into bloom. The island is teeming with life. While visiting the island, one may have to give way to a passing sea lion or marine iguana. Flocks of pelicans and swallow-tailed gulls feed off shore, and seasonally, Nazca boobies can also be seen. Vegetation and terrain in the dry season North Seymour is an extraordinary place for breeding birds, and is home to one of the largest populations of nesting blue-footed boobies and magnificent frigate birds. Pairs of blue-footed boobies can be seen conducting their mating ritual as they offer each other gifts, whistle and honk, stretch their necks towards the sky, spread their wings, and dance‚Äîshowing off their bright blue feet. Magnificent frigatebirds perch in low bushes, near the boobies, while watching over their large chicks. The frigates are huge, dark aerobats with a wingspan. Male frigates can puff up their scarlet throat sacks to resemble giant red balloons. Boobies and frigates have an interesting relationship. Boobies are excellent hunters and fish in flocks. The frigates by comparison are pirates, they dive bomb the boobies to force them to drop their prey. Then, the aerobatic frigate swoops down and picks up the food before it hits the water. Conservation and Restoration The Directorate of Gal√°pagos National Park and Island Conservation reintroduced 1,436 Gal√°pagos land iguanas (Conolophus subcristatus) to Santiago Island on 4 January 2019 after a 180 year absence. The partners reintroduced the land iguanas in an effort to restore that island‚Äôs ecological health and to provide the opportunity for this iguana species to thrive. Land iguanas were sourced from North Seymour Island, where they were introduced in the 1930s and have increased to over 5,000 and faced a lack of food availability. Charles Darwin was the second-last person to record land iguanas alive on Santiago Island in 1835, with Abel-Nicolas Bergasse du Petit-Thouars being the last in 1838. On January 12, 2019, The Directorate of Gal√°pagos National Park and Island Conservation used drones to eradicate invasive rats from the island - this is the first time such an approach has been used on vertebrates in the wild. The operation aims to remove black rats (Rattus rattus) and brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) which are negatively impacting native species. The expectations is that this innovation will pave the way for cheaper invasive species eradications in the future on small and mid-sized islands.

It is an important salt of the thiocyanate anion, one of the pseudohalides. The compound has a low melting point relative to most other inorganic salts. Use in chemical synthesis Aqueous KSCN reacts almost quantitatively with Pb(NO3)2 to give Pb(SCN)2, which has been used to convert acyl chlorides to isothiocyanates. KSCN converts ethylene carbonate to ethylenesulfide. For this purpose, the KSCN is first melted under vacuum to remove water. In a related reaction, KSCN converts cyclohexene oxide to the corresponding episulfide. :C6H10O + KSCN -> C6H10S + KOCN KSCN is also the starting product for the synthesis of carbonyl sulfide. Other uses Dilute aqueous KSCN is occasionally used for moderately realistic blood effects in film and theater. It can be painted onto a surface or kept as a colorless solution. When in contact with ferric chloride solution (or other solutions containing Fe3+), the product of the reaction is a solution with a blood red colour, due to the formation of the thiocyanatoiron complex ion. Thus this chemical is often used to create the effect of 'stigmata'. Because both solutions are colorless, they can be placed separately on each hand. When the hands are brought into contact, the solutions react and the effect looks remarkably like stigmata. Similarly, this reaction is used as a test for Fe3+ in the laboratory.

Cyclone Percy originated as a tropical disturbance on February 23. Over the course of the next few days, the system organized while moving east-southeastward, before intensifying into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian region scale on February 26. The system quickly intensified, reaching Category 4 status later that day. On the next day, Percy was steered southward by a blocking ridge of high pressure, while stretched out the structure of the storm into an elliptical shape, weakening it back to Category 3 status. Afterward, the storm rapidly reintensified, reaching its peak intensity as a Category 5 tropical cyclone on March 2. Afterward, Percy encountered increasing wind shear and weakened once again, turning southeastward on the next day. On March 5, Percy transitioned into an extratropical storm, before dissipating soon afterward. Percy was also the most damaging of the South Pacific February cyclones that year, as it battered the Cook Islands, which were still recovering from the impacts of Cyclones Meena, Nancy and Olaf. Percy then devastated the island of Tokelau, leaving many homeless and millions in dollars in property damages (although exact damage figures are unavailable). Because of warnings in anticipation of the storm, there were no deaths and there were only a few injuries. Meteorological history During February 23, the Fiji Meteorological Service reported that Tropical Disturbance 10F, had developed within the monsoon trough about to the west of the Tuvaluan atoll of Funafuti. The system was then located just south of a 250-hPa ridge axis, in a diffluent region. Wind shear and diurnal variations were evidently influencing development. Sea surface temperatures (SST) were around 31 ¬∞C. Later on February 24, shear had decreased markedly. Outflow was favorable and developing in all quadrants. Overnight, the tropical depression underwent explosive development, with the deep convection increasing spatially and in organization while cooling. Spiral bands were also wrapping tightly around the low-level circulation center (LLCC). Since the depression was located in an area of low wind shear and warm water temperatures, the storm was able to quickly strengthen into Tropical Storm Percy, by 1800 UTC on February 24. At this point in time, Percy was located east of Fongafale, Tuvalu, and was moving towards the east-southeast at 14 kt (16 mph, 26 km/h). On February 26, Percy reached Category 1 status, while located 400 miles (644 km) north of American Samoa. While Percy moved east-southeast, a shortwave trough developed southwest of the storm. The trough caused the cyclone to intensify even further to a Category 3 storm, as it passed between Fakaofa and Swains Island. Percy then reached its initial peak at Category 4 status north of Pago Pago, as its winds reached over 135 mph (115 knots, 213 km/h) and the barometric pressure at its center fell to 925 millibars. On February 27, Cyclone Percy encountered a ridge of high pressure, which slowed its forward speed. Because of this, the cyclone's structure became elliptical, which caused the cyclone to weaken back to Category 3 status.Percy report Retrieved:June 12, 2006 By February 28, Percy bypassed the Pukapuka and Nassau Islands as a Category 3 tropical cyclone, as it continued to move south-southeastward. By then, the cyclone was re- organizing as the storm was steered to the southeast. On March 2, Percy reached its peak intensity, with sustained winds reached 160 mph (140 knots, 265 km/h) on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and an estimated barometric pressure of 900 millibars. Cyclone Percy maintained Category 5 status for 18 hours, while located 110 mi (177 km) west of Palmerston Island. After reaching Category 5 status, Percy began to weaken, due to increasing wind shear. During its weakening phase, Cyclone Percy passed south of Tropical Depression 20S. Pulled by an upper level trough, Percy swung to the east, passing Tropical Depression 24S in the process, before being caught up by another trough. By March 4, the center of Percy became detached from the main area of convection and Percy quickly weakened to a tropical storm. Tropical Storm Percy then quickly accelerated to 20 kt (23 mph, 37 km/h) as it became an extratropical storm. Percy briefly entered the New Zealand area of responsibility before becoming extratropical at 1200 UTC. By March 5, the remnants of Percy finally dissipated 700 miles (1127 km) southwest of Rarotonga.Monthly Global Tropical Cyclone Summary February 2005 Preparations When Percy quickly reached tropical cyclone strength, forecasters began to issue watches and warnings for the American Samoa and Tokelau areas, which were impacted by earlier storms Nancy and Olaf.AP Warning 1 Retrieved:12 June 2006 As Percy continued to move eastward, forecasters predicted the storm to strengthen into a Category 2 or Category 3 storm within 12‚Äì24 hours. meanwhile, forecasters issued gale warnings for Tokelau.AP Warning 2 Retrieved:12 June 2006 On 26 February, forecasters predicted Percy would stay on its current track and miss the island of Atafu by 50‚Äì70 miles (80‚Äì113 km), even though the storm could bring damaging gale-force winds and heavy rains to the island. However, forecasters predicted Percy would make landfall on Tokelau. In American Samoa, hurricane warnings were issued for Swains Island, while the rest of American Samoa remained under a hurricane watch.AP Warning 3 Retrieved:12 June 2006 Later, the gale warnings for Tokelau were changed to hurricane warnings as Percy moved to within 75 miles (121 km) north of Atafu. In Nukunou and Fakaofo, forecasters predicted that the cyclone would bring 60‚Äì70 mph (95‚Äì111 km/h) winds, heavy rains and possible flooding in low-lying areas.AP Warning 4 Retrieved:12 June 2006 Forecasters predicted that Cyclone Percy was going to turn to the southeast and hit the islands of Pukapuka and Nassau directly. Because of this, evacuations were ordered and emergency shelters were activated in Rarotonga. Forecasters also predicted that Percy was going to cause a strong storm surge. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center and NOAA also predicted that the storm was going to strengthen further within 12‚Äì24 hours. In addition, forecast models predicted that Cyclone Percy would take a similar track like Cyclone Olaf weeks earlier. That prompted officials in the southern Cook Islands to order evacuations.AP Warning 5 Retrieved:12 June 2006 Effects Severe Tropical Cyclone Percy impacted Tokelau, Samoa, American Samoa as well as the Northern and Southern Cook Islands, where it caused widespread damage. Like the earlier cyclones Meena, Nancy, and Olaf, Percy left widespread damage across Swains Island, Tokelau, and the northern Cook Islands. However, because of well-executed warnings, there were no deaths and there were only a few injuries. Percy was the worst cyclone to strike Tokelau since a similar cyclone hit the area in 1966.Evaluations and Lessons Learned: Cook Islands and Tokelau: Tropical Cyclone Percy ‚Äì March 2005, Cook Islands and Tokelau: Tropical Cyclone Percy ‚Äì OCHA Situation Report No. 5, Situation Reports: Cook Islands and Tokelau: Tropical Cyclone Percy ‚Äì 20 March =Tokelau= Cyclone Percy hitting Swains Island on February 27, 2005 Percy impacted Tokelau between February 25 - 27, where it caused widespread damage within the three atolls of Nukunonu, Fakaofo and Atafu. Ahead of the system impacting the New Zealand dependency, a gale warning was issued for the whole of Tokelau by the FMS, before this was upgraded to a storm warning later that day for the atolls of Nukunono and Fakaofo. However, these warnings were not received on the islands and the first notification of the impending cyclone came in a telephone call from New Zealand.https://web.archive.org/web/20051104232817/http://www.undp.org.ws/PDF/tokelaureport_perci.pdf A hurricane warning was also issued for the disputed territory of Swains Island during that day by the United States Weather Service Office in Pago Pago, American Samoa. =American Samoa and Tokelau= The strong winds from Percy knocked out power and communications infrastructure in Swains Island. Efforts to re-establish contact with the island were unsuccessful for a week. After the storm, however, all eight people who rode out the storm survived, though nine of the eleven buildings on the islands were destroyed or severely damaged.Monthly Global Tropical Cyclone Summary February 2005 Damage in American Samoa was minimal.AP Warning Retrieved 12 June 2006 In Tokelau, Percy damaged trees and knocked down powerlines. During the height of the storm, one person was injured by flying debris, and two others were swept out to sea, but all three survived. In Nokonunu, the cyclone destroyed the only school and damaged 80% of the structures. The local hospital completely lost power during the storm and its emergency generator was overwhelmed by the flooding.UNDP damage assessment Retrieved 12 June 2006 In Fakaofo, the storm surge from Percy damaged a sea wall and caused major beach erosion. One house was destroyed while others were severely damaged. Percy also damaged much of the coconut harvest and 50% of the livestock were killed by the cyclone. Atafu also suffered similar damage as the storm damaged a UHF tower and several storage sheds. Damage to crops was also significant as the storm damaged much of the banana and pandanus harvests. The schools in Atafu suffered only minimal damage (mostly wind damage). =Cook Islands= The northern Cook Islands were hardest hit by Percy as the storm left 640 people homeless, of which 600 were in Pukapuka, and 40 were in Nassau. Of the buildings and houses destroyed or severely damaged, only ten were left standing. One person was rescued when his fishing boat stalled during the storm.Planet Ark.com: State of Emergency declared after Cyclone Percy Retrieved:12 June 2006 Percy also damaged a solar power station, making it inoperable.www.ser.org Percy also battered the southern Cook Islands while weakening, although the damage there was minimal. =Aftermath= A building in Tokelau damaged by Cyclone Percy Relief efforts followed after Cyclone Percy. In Swains Island, a rescue plane dropped food and supplies. In Tokelau and northern Cook Islands, the governments of Australia and New Zealand offered over $200,000 dollars (2005 USD) in relief aid.Australian Government Overseas Aid Retrieved:12 June 2006 In Tokelau, many of the local officials feared about contamination since the cyclone had scattered human waste, trash, and other debris in the ocean and across the island. There was also an increase of mosquitoes and other insects, increasing the threat of a dengue fever outbreak. In addition, the storm damaged many of the hospitals, making treatment of the injured or displaced difficult.Relief Web Retrieved:12 June 2006 Criticism of government preparedness followed after Percy as emergency plans were not easily understood by the local population. In Nukunonu, the school, which was destroyed by Percy, was poorly built and vulnerable, and there was no early warning system. Also, many of the population had little time to prepare for the storm because of a social event held hours earlier.

History The history of the span dates to the early 1970s when possible routings for a future Ohio River span were being discussed. To conform to the Huntington city comprehensive plan, the alignment preferred by the city was one that connected to Interstate 64 outside of the city boundaries.

With other related species of lupines also called bluebonnets, it is the state flower of Texas.How did bluebonnets become state flower? It is an annual which begins its life as a small, gravel-like seed. The seed has a hard seed coat that must be penetrated by wind, rain, and weather over the course of a few months (but sometimes several years). In the fall, the bluebonnets emerge as small seedlings with two cotyledons, and later a rosette of leaves that are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets 3‚Äì10 cm long, green with a faint white edge and hair. Growth continues over the mild winter, and then in the spring takes off, rapidly grow larger, before sending up a 20‚Äì to 50-cm-tall plume of blue flowers (with bits of white and occasionally a tinge of pinkish-red). The scent of these blossoms has been diversely described; many people say they give off no scent at all, while a few have described the scent as 'sickly sweet'. Bluebonnet seeds have a hard outer shell to protect from dry conditions as the plant grows better in moist years. Seeds may be scarified - a process to weaken the seed casing to encourage germination - before being stored. If scarified and stored at twenty-two degrees Celsius, the seeds face no reduction in germinability one year after being harvested and treated.Effect of Scarification, Seed Storage Temperature, and Relative Humidity on Lupinus havardii Wats. and Lupinus texensis Hook. Seed Germination It has been found in the wild with isolated mutations in other colors, most notably all-white flowers, pink, and the maroon 'Alamo Fire' variation. These mutations have since been selectively bred to produce different color strains that are available commercially. Texas recognizes all native lupine species occurring in the state as the official state flower. That fact leads to other species such as L. subcarnosus and L. havardii also being referred to as bluebonnets, but distinctions are seen among the species that differentiate them from L. texensis.

With an apparent visual magnitude of 2.76, it is the brightest star in the open star cluster IC 2602. It marks the northeastern end of the Diamond Cross asterism. Parallax measurements from the Hipparcos mission place this star at a distance of about from Earth. Properties Simulated image of IC 2602 with Œ∏ Car at the centre The MKK stellar classification of this star is B0.5 Vp, which indicates this B-type main sequence star generates energy through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in its core. The 'p' suffix designates peculiar spectral features, which have been observed in both optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. Theta Carinae is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with a 2.2 day period; the shortest known orbital period among massive stars, suggesting earlier mass transfer between the two components, possibly explaining the spectral peculiarities. In this spectroscopic system, the primary star is probably a blue straggler, which is an unusual type of star created by merging or the interaction between two or more stars. The source of the mass transfer is likely to be the less massive secondary companion, and what is now is the primary star was probably originally the less massive component. The estimated age of the pair is 4 million years, and it appears much younger than the surrounding IC 2602 cluster. The primary star is about 15 solar masses () and five solar radii (). Theta Carinae has an intensely hot outer radiating envelope with an effective surface temperature of 31,000 K. Once the primary reaches around 11 million years old, the star will expand and will begin to transferring its outer surface mass back to its companion. Little is known about the companion star, but it is likely an F-type star with a luminosity less than 1% of the primary.

After the Bolshevik take-over of his country in early 1920s he emigrated to Poland, where he joined the Polish Army and then the Polish Navy. Between 1935 and 1939 he was the commanding officer (in the rank of Captain) of ORP Jask√≥≈Çka, a Polish minesweeper and minelayer. Later on he became the deputy commander of the ORP Gryf. At the outbreak of the Polish Defensive War of 1939, on September 1, with other Polish warships, Gryf left the naval base at Gdynia for the Operation Rurka, a failed attempt to lay a minefield at the entrances to the Gda≈Ñsk Bay. After boarding naval mines from a floating depot, the flotilla headed for Hel Peninsula, assisted by ORP Wicher and several smaller vessels (among them ≈Åomidze's former ship Jask√≥≈Çka). En route she was attacked by a squadron of 33 German Ju 87B dive bombers and hit with several bombs. Although the damages were minor, the ship lost 22 sailors, including its captain Lt.Cmdr. Stefan Kwiatkowski in what became known as the battle of the Gda≈Ñsk Bay. Kwiatkowski's deputy, Capt. Wiktor ≈Åomidze decided to throw all defused naval mines in the waters for fear of explosion and headed for Hel naval base. There it was decided to use the ship as a floating anti-air artillery battery guarding the harbour. During the final days of the Polish defence of Pomerania, ≈Åomidze, along with several other naval officers, crossed the Baltic on a small fishing cutter. They reached the port of LiepƒÅja, from where ≈Åomidze got to Sweden and then to the United Kingdom. There he applied to the Polish Navy being reconstructed there by the Polish Government in Exile. Although he was admitted, he was also held responsible for the decision to throw away the mines back in September 1939, a decision that successfully crippled the Polish defensive operations in the Baltic Sea. Because of that, and despite ≈Åomidze's pleas, he was never again given a command over any Polish vessel. Instead he spent the remainder of World War II at various staff duties. He finished his career in the rank of Commander.

This guidance focuses on records management issues involving records that have been created using electronic signature technology. The Act requires agencies, by October 21, 2003, to allow individuals or entities that deal with the agencies the option to submit information or transact with the agency electronically, when practicable, and to maintain records electronically, when practicable. The Act specifically states that electronic records and their related electronic signatures are not to be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability merely because they are in electronic form, and encourages Federal government use of a range of electronic signature alternatives.Office of Management and Budget Guidelines The Act seeks to \\"preclude agencies or courts from systematically treating electronic documents and signatures less favorably than their paper counterparts\\", so that citizens can interact with the Federal government electronically.S. Rep. 105-335 It requires Federal agencies, by October 21, 2003, to provide individuals or entities that deal with agencies the option to submit information or transact with the agency electronically, and to maintain records electronically, when practicable. It also addresses the matter of private employers being able to use electronic means to store, and file with Federal agencies, information pertaining to their employees. GPEA states that electronic records and their related electronic signatures are not to be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability merely because they are in electronic form. It also encourages Federal government use of a range of electronic signature alternatives. The Act is technology-neutral, meaning that the act does not require the government to use one technology over another. This approach has both advantages and disadvantages. By remaining neutral it allows each government agency to decide which technology fits its specific needs. It also means that the government is not restricted to use an older technology as newer and better systems are made available. As a disadvantage some may argue over which signature capturing method is best and such disagreements may slow the process of implementation.

The Daily Campus has the largest circulation of any college paper in Connecticut and the third-largest in New England, behind The Daily Collegian (UMass) and The Harvard Crimson (Harvard University). Since its creation, the newspaper has undergone several name changes, starting as The Storrs Agricultural College Lookout, a monthly, when it published its first issue on May 11, 1896. The name was changed to The Connecticut Campus in 1915, followed by The Connecticut Daily Campus, and then finally just The Daily Campus in 1984. It began publishing five days a week during the academic year in 1952 and became a morning paper in 1955. The newspaper's offices are located at The Daily Campus Building at 1266 Storrs Road in Storrs, Connecticut. The paper was previously located across campus at 121 North Eagleville Road, but moved to the current location in 1991/1992. Though originally addressed at 11 Dog Lane, the building was re-addressed as 1266 Storrs Road in the spring of 2012 to accommodate the new buildings being constructed alongside the building as part of the new Storrs Center. The building is located at the south entrance to campus, across the street from the Fine Arts Building, and adjacent to Buckley Residence Hall. The two-story building houses the business staff and front desk on the bottom floor, and the newsroom and conference room on the second. The Editor-in-Chief, Managing Editor and Associate Managing Editor have offices on the second floor, while the Business Manager's office is located on the first. The newspaper features four main sections: News, Opinion, Life and Sports. Each section has its own department run by an editor and associate editor. There is also a Photography department, which provides student-shot pictures for every section. The photographers are managed by both a photo editor and associate editor. A Circulation Manager plans the delivery routes and manages these student- drivers in the Circulation department. In addition, the paper employs an Advertising Director, Financial Manager, Business Manager, a Digital Editor, and an Associate Digital Editor. Students of all majors are encouraged to join the staff.  News  The news section covers campus news, including breaking news, administrative decisions, investigative stories and clubs and organizations like the Undergraduate Student Government. It also covers local, state and national issues as they relate to UConn. The Daily Campus won the College Media Association award for Best News Delivery for its coverage of controversial speaker Lucian Wintrich who was arrested when he came to speak at the university in November 2017. In December 2005, when controversial conservative commentator Ann Coulter visited UConn at the invitation of the College Republicans, The Daily Campus was granted the only one-on-one interview with Coulter and was the only outlet with pictures from inside the theater. No other media outlets were allowed inside. The speech itself was marked by protests on campus and alternative \\"hate free\\" events, and was cut short after about 15 minutes when a prank recording of \\"Kyle's Mom Is A Big Fat Bitch\\" from the TV show South Park was played over the loudspeakers. The spring 2020 News Editor is Ashley Anglisano. The spring 2020 Associate News Editor is Taylor Harton.  Opinion  The Opinion section, which features columnists as well as the Letters to the Editor. The Commentary section is always located on page 4 of the first section of the paper. Opinion features a selection of weekly columnists, usually three, who have written for the paper for a few years. Each weekly columnist writes one featured column a week. The Opinion Editor and Associate Editor typically write a featured column weekly as well, meaning there is one featured column on each weekday. Also published in the section are columns by staff columnists, who write on a semi-regular basis. All manner of topics are discussed in Opinion, both local and national. Opinion also publishes a short daily editorial that is considered the official opinion of The Daily Campus. It has been featured on the left side of page 4 in recent years. The Daily Campus editorial board, composed of the Opinion editors, weekly columnists and Editor-in-Chief, meet weekly in order to determine the editorials for the coming week. A disclaimer was added below the editorial in 2003 following an incident in which 9,000 copies of the paper were stolen after a controversial column was published in Opinion (see Controversies below). The disclaimer states that only the editorial is the official opinion of the paper, while the columns are the opinions of the columnist and columnist alone. In 2014 the opinion section had to retract and issue an apology for a piece entitled \\"On sexual assault, risk of overreacting.\\" The piece was, reportedly, never supposed to be released and was only printed due to \\"distractions.\\" The story came in response to the university's handling of several sexual assault cases and the national trend of universities across the country endorsing affirmative consent for all sexual activity. The piece expresses the opinion that affirmative consent is not always practical or viable if both parties had been drinking. The Opinion section no longer includes the following features: Instant Daily was started in 2003 by then Commentary Editor Dan Maxwell. Instant Daily received hundreds of instant messages per day with a select few (about a half-dozen) being chosen for publication by the editors. Most submissions were comical observations of campus life, though tributes (such as ones following the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting), remembrances (often following student deaths) and topical issues are also discussed. Instant Daily has received criticism for being an anonymous forum where students can make hurtful comments without fear of repercussions. Husky Talk is a sidebar which features a question that is answered by a handful of students on campus. The respondents' photos are published next to their answers. The questions and answers run the gamut from serious to sarcastic to relatively inane. Other features include a Quick Wit (a humorous quote-of-the-day) and an editorial cartoon. Various features including a This Day in History element were once included in Commentary but have either been moved to other parts of the paper or removed altogether. The 2020-2021 Opinion Editor is Harry Zehner. The 2020-2021 Associate Opinion Editor is Harrison Raskin.  Comics  The Comics section runs one page long, usually on page 5 across from the Opinion section. It is not a part of Opinion or the News department, however. The section also runs a daily crossword puzzle, horoscopes and a sudoku puzzle.  Life  The Life Department covers performances, entertainment and style on campus. It regularly features reviews of on campus events, such as concerts, plays and guest lectures. The Life Department is credentialed for all on-campus events, including performances at von der Mehden Recital Hall and Jorgensen Center for the Performing Arts. It also covers the annual Spring Weekend concert, held at Gampel Pavilion, and has featured artists such as Kendrick Lamar and Steve Aoki in 2013, Wiz Khalifa in 2012 and others including Busta Rhymes, Guster, O.A.R., 50 Cent and Nas in recent years. Life regularly includes features and weekly columns about matters of interest to students such as sexual health, relationships, academics, employment, and entertainment. Each day of the week, page 8 is a \\"Focus on\\" page with a set theme: television, movies, video games, music and lifestyle. Each day the column, reviews, features and sidebar elements on page 8 (often carrying over to page 9) fit that theme. These sidebar elements include a list of upcoming shows (music), highest ranked video games (video games), most watched shows (television) and upcoming releases (movies), as well as a staff-chosen show, album, movie, video game or app of the week. Life is on the front page of the second section of The Daily Campus. It shares the same section as Sports, which starts on the back page. The first three pages of Life are almost always in full color. The 2020-2021 Life Editor is Hollianne Lao. The 2020-2021 Associate Life Editor is Rebecca Maher.  Sports  The Sports Department, staffed by approximately 20 writers, is credentialed to all on-campus and several off-campus UConn sporting events. With the emergence of UConn as a powerhouse in the world of collegiate sports, the Sports section has taken off in popularity in recent decades. The department covers as many sports as its staffing level allows. It always covers men's basketball, women's basketball and football. It also has regular beat writers for men's and women's soccer, field hockey, men's and women's ice hockey, lacrosse, baseball, softball, men's and women's tennis, men's and women's track/cross country, men's and women's swimming & diving, golf, rowing and club sports. When staff allows, many sports will have two beat writers. Basketball and football always have multiple beat writers. The budget for the Sports Department is the highest of any of the sections. This allows beat writers to travel to important away games and tournaments, especially for the larger sports such as basketball and football. Writers have covered the men's and women's basketball teams throughout the NCAA tournament, from Washington D.C. to San Antonio, Texas; Tampa, Florida; Charlotte, North Carolina; Phoenix, Arizona and Fresno, California. Beat writers reported on location at all 10 of UConn's basketball titles - men's (1999, 2004 and 2011) and women's (1995, 2000, 2002-2004, 2009-2010). A writer also traveled to the Maui Invitational in 2005, which UConn won. Two beat writers were sent to Detroit for UConn's first bowl game in football, the 2004 Motor City Bowl, as well as UConn's bowl appearance in the 2007 Meineke Car Care Bowl. Following the UConn football team's Big East championship in 2010, three reporters were sent to Glendale, Arizona to report on the school's first BCS bowl appearance in the 2011 Fiesta Bowl, in which UConn was defeated by heavily favored Oklahoma. The Daily Campus published a special extra for the Motor City Bowl victory over Toledo, as well as the Maui Invitational title. While mainstream sports success is a thing of recent vintage, The Daily Campus has covered sports since almost the very beginning, when the paper was still referred to as The Lookout. In the December 1900 issue of The Lookout, an editorial ran stating, \\"It is in the opinion of the students that basket ball could be introduced into our college sports.\\" Basketball was indeed started at the school in 1901 and The Lookout covered the first game, writing, \\"It may be justly said that the first attempt at C.A.C. [Connecticut Agricultural College, as UConn was then known] at basket-ball was a success.\\" The Lookout reported again, a year later, when the first women's basketball game was played, \\"The college girls started in with a vigor amazing to behold, and soon Miss Koons soon made a pretty throw into the basket from the field.\\" The Daily Campus Sports Department was involved in two national stories during the 2002-2003 school year. In November 2002, sports columnist Matt Burke wrote a column titled \\"Memorial's goalposts must go.\\" The UConn football team was closing out their season with a game against Kent State, and with a new, off campus, stadium opening the next year, Burke wrote, \\"I am imploring you, the student population, to tear down those goalposts at the conclusion of Saturday's football game, win or lose.\\" UConn won the game, and when hundreds of students spilled on the field to take down the posts, police with attack dogs had encircled the goalposts. Students rushing the posts were pepper sprayed and beset by dogs. The one student to make it to the posts was handcuffed and taken into police custody. The violent incident made national headlines, and Burke's column, whether the impetus or not, was featured prominently, on shows such as ESPN's Pardon the Interruption. The following spring The Daily Campus again made national headlines. The UConn women's basketball team had set a collegiate record for 70 straight victories before losing to Villanova on March 11, 2003 in the Big East championship. In the postgame press conference, a reporter from a New Jersey paper began by asking UConn head coach Geno Auriemma what he would do to make sure the loss did not linger through the NCAA tournament. After Auriemma answered the somewhat-blasphemous question with an equal amount of sarcasm, The Daily Campus beat writer Amanda Alnutt asked a similar follow-up question. Alnutt: What are you going to do to make sure that it doesn't happen [again]? Auriemma: You ask a lot of questions that really piss me off. You're too young to ask those questions. Older guys can ask me questions that piss me off. You're too young. You see, this is just a f -ing game. It's not the end of the world. But every question you ask is like, 'We should cancel the season now because we lost.' Relax. Alnutt: You don't think you need to do anything to prepare your team for that? They just lost and now they have to go into the NCAA tournament? Auriemma: So what does every game have to do with the rest? We lost a game today. We just won 70 straight. Did that have anything to do with this one?USATODAY.com - UConn's Auriemma: Rough, but not out of the ordinary The clip was replayed on ESPN's SportsCenter repeatedly in the days following and was featured prominently on shows such as ESPN's Pardon the Interruption. Auriemma received plenty of criticism for his handling of the situation. Auriemma would later meet with Alnutt personally and apologize, and also wrote about the incident in his autobiography, remarking that he wished he had spoken to her privately instead of chastising her in front of the press. The 2020-2021 Sports Editor is Danny Barletta. The 2020-2021 Associate Sports Editor is Conner Gilson.  Board Shift  In 2015 the Daily Campus switched to a board composed entirely of student voters, rather than the mixture of professionals (non-students) and students that have served on the board since the seventies. The decision was made after the University threatened to take away funding from the paper. They could have potentially lost over 300,000 dollars in student fees. Fees which account for nearly 3/4s of the papers total income. Prior to the decision, the 9 person board consisted of 7 professionals and 2 students. Before 2004 the board held 6 professionals. The board structure introduced in 2015 consists of 7 voting, student board members and an additional 5-member, non-voting advisory board made up of professionals including at least one journalist, lawyer and finance/accounting professional. Since the board changes the paper has continued to thrive in the current environment The Board now consists of 11, voting student members. It is headed by Editor-in-Chief (Peter Fenteany). Other board members are the Managing Editor (Alexandra Houdeshell), Associate Managing Editor (Brandon Barzola), Digital Editor (Courtney Gavitt), Business Manager (Jack Dwyer), Advertising Director (David Fox), as well as five other members (Avery Bikerman, Hollianne Lao, Ashley Anglisano, Maggie Chafouleas, and Kevin Lindstrom).  Photo and Video  The photo department provides photos to accompany stories for all sections of the paper. The 2020-2021 Photo and Video Editor is Kevin Lindstrom. The 2020-2021 Associate Photo Editor is Maggie Chafouleas. The 2020-2021 Associate Video Editor is Eric Wang.  Extras and more  The paper also regularly publishes special extras, usually tabloid-style inserts of approximately eight to 12 pages. Focus Extras (called \\"Out of Focus\\") are often published in accordance with the seasons (Fall, Winter, Spring), but the most common extras are put out by the Sports Department. An annual Homecoming Football Extra is published prior to the team's homecoming game, while Basketball Extras are published for major rivalry games. Husky Hoopla, an annual basketball issue, is published around Midnight Madness every year and highlights the upcoming season for both men's and women's basketball. The paper has also published special jackets (covering the entire paper) following basketball national championships, including full- color jackets on the consecutive days of April 6 and April 7, 2004 following UConn's unprecedented sweep of the men's and women's titles. Recently, the paper has published numerous jackets previewing or commemorating major events. Notable among these was a commemorative jacket published on the first anniversary of Jasper Howard's death and a jacket previewing the UConn football team's critical season finale against South Florida, a game that UConn would win on a late field goal to clinch the school's second Big East championship and first ever BCS Bowl berth. The paper has also published jackets previewing the outdoor hockey game played at Rentschler Field and several throughout the men's basketball team's run to the Big East and National Championship in 2011. Students lay out the newspaper every Sunday through Thursday night using the program Adobe InDesign and can take anywhere from four to eight hours nightly to lay out the 14-18 pages of each issue. The newspaper itself has often been in the news in recent years, with an editorial column calling for the resignation of UConn President Philip E. Austin in 2005 after construction problems arose in the building of various on-campus structures as part of the state of Connecticut's UCONN 2000 and 21st Century UConn projects. The building was also the site of the theft of computer equipment in August 2005, just days before the beginning of publication for the new school year.

He was the People's Artist of Uzbekistan. Gavriel Mullokandov was born on 8 April 1900 in Samarkand to a family of music lovers. He got much of his musical training and experience from his older brothers and from the age of nine began to sing in synagogue. At the age of 11 Gavriel was already singing at weddings and concerts and the public loved him. From his childhood, he learned everything about Shashmakom (a style of music in Central Asia) and could play all local instruments. During the 1920s Gavriel worked with his brother Mihoel, who was also one of the greatest singers and musicians in Central Asia. In 1925‚Äì26 they were joined by Levi Babahanov, who once was a court musician of Emir of Bukhara. In 1929 Gavriel Mullokandov won a contest in Samarkand for the best Shashmakom singer and was recognized as a new music star. In 1930‚Äì32 Gavriel and Mihoel Mullokandovs together with other Bukharian activists organized a Bukharian Jewish theater in Samarkand. In it, they were joined by such outstanding Bukharian Jews as Aron Saidov, Murduhai Bachaev and Bahor Kandhorov. The Jewish theater became very famous in Central Asia, Moscow, Leningrad and Baku. In 1936 Gavriel Mullokandov was awarded the title of People's Artist of Uzbekistan. In the following years he was awarded with many other government awards. In 1940 Mullokandov was elected to the City Council of Samarkand. During the Second World War, Gavriel Mullokandov was among the artists of Bukharian Jewish Theater, who traveled around the USSR performing in support of the war effort. Mullokandov did a lot to promote Bukharian Jewish culture. Songs that he sang, music that he played were forever saved in the archives of Uzbek and Tajik radio and television. Even though he lived in the atheist state, Mullokandov never forgot his roots and religion. He celebrated Jewish holidays and his home was always full of people, who came to listen to his songs. Gavriel Mullokandov also promoted peaceful and friendly relations between Uzbek and Tajik people and Bukharian Jews. He was very respected by non-Jewish population. One of his best friends was the great Uzbek writer Gafur Gulyam, who during the war wrote a poem called \\"Men ‚Äì Yahudiy\\" or \\"I'm a Jew\\". Mullokandov died on 6 February 1972. In 1976 the Central Committee of Uzbekistan renamed Eastern Street in Samarkand, where he was born and lived most of his life, in his honor.

He is renowned in Australia for his work as a theatre director from the 1960s to the present, and is best known internationally as the director of the 1973 theatrical hit The Rocky Horror Show, its film adaptation The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) and the film's follow-up, Shock Treatment (1981).Robyn Anderson & Sue Adler, \\"Jim Sharman\\", Cinema Papers, March‚ÄìApril 1979, pp. 269-271 Life and career Sharman was born in Sydney, the son of boxing tent impresario and rugby league player James Michael \\"Jimmy\\" Sharman Jr. (1912‚Äì2006) and Christina McAndleish Sharman (1914‚Äì2003). He was educated in Sydney, though his upbringing included time spent on Australian showgrounds, where his father ran a travelling sideshow of popular legend, founded by his father, Jimmy Sharman Snr, called Jimmy Sharman's Boxing Troupe. This brought him into contact with the world of circus and travelling vaudeville. Developing an interest in theatre, he graduated from the production course at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney in 1966. Sharman created a series of productions of experimental theatre, many for the Old Tote Theatre Company, culminating in a controversial staging of Mozart's Don Giovanni for Opera Australia when he was 21 years old. Over the following decade, he directed three rock musicals: Hair in 1969 (Sydney, Melbourne, Tokyo, Boston) (he also designed the original Sydney production); Jesus Christ Superstar in 1972 (Australia and Palace Theatre, London) and created the original production of The Rocky Horror Show with Richard O'Brien in 1973 (Royal Court Theatre, London ‚Äì subsequently in Sydney, Los Angeles, Melbourne, New York City). He co-wrote the screenplay and directed the international cult hit film The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) for Twentieth Century Fox and directed its loosely based sequel, Shock Treatment,in 1981. In 1985, he directed third year students at the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) in a production of A Dream Play. In the following decades, Sharman directed a series of new works and Australian premieres, including a series of productions of plays by Patrick White in the late 1970s - The Season at Sarsaparilla, Big Toys, Netherwood and A Cheery Soul ‚Äì which are credited with reviving the Nobel Laureate's career as a dramatist. He also directed the film The Night the Prowler, from a screenplay adapted by White from one of his short stories, and notable as White's only produced film screenplay. One of Sharman's most frequent creative collaborators was production designer Brian Thomson, a partnership that began at the Old Tote and continued through their ground- breaking and widely praised stage productions, the rock musicals Hair, Jesus Christ Superstar and The Rocky Horror Show, and the films Shirley Thompson vs. the Aliens, The Rocky Horror Picture Show and Shock Treatment. Sharman was artistic director of the Adelaide Festival of Arts in 1982 and, while in South Australia, he created Lighthouse, a theatre company which specialised in radical stagings of classics and premieres of new work by major Australian dramatists, including Louis Nowra, Stephen Sewell and Patrick White. The ensemble included many major Australian artists, including actors Geoffrey Rush, Gillian Jones, John Wood and Kerry Walker and associate director Neil Armfield, who would further develop this adventurous tradition at Sydney's Belvoir Street Theatre. Continuing as a freelance director, Sharman's most recent work has been Stephen Sewell's Three Furies ‚Äì scenes from the life of Francis Bacon, for which he won a Helpmann Award for Best Direction of a Play. It played at the 2005 Sydney and Auckland festivals and the 2006 Perth and Adelaide festivals. In 2006, he revived his landmark staging of Benjamin Britten's Death in Venice for Opera Australia. In 2009, he will direct a new production of Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte for Opera Australia, a collaboration with the Berlin-based Australian conductor Simon Hewett.

Description Male forewing: dorsum and termen very convex; costa arched. Female forewing: differs only in being narrower and the dorsum sinuous. Hindwing in both sexes: costa and termen strongly curved, forming together half of an ellipse of which the straight dorsal margin is the chord. Male. Upperside black, the forewing with a brilliant blue gloss throughout, the base brown; hindwing: the upper portion silky hair-brown, the disc and terminal margin shot with blue. Forewing: a very large, irregular, white spot filling the apex of the discoidal cell, three elongate spots divided by the nervures above and one or two small white spots below, the whole forming an irregular oblique bar; a large sub-terminal blue spot in interspace 2 and smaller similar spots in interspaces 4-7; finally a line of 3 or 4 small terminal blue spots near the tornus: all these blue spots occasionally white-centred. Hindwing: broad white streaks in interspaces la, 1b, 1 and 2, a spot (sometimes absent) at base of interspace 3, another (but rarely) at base of interspace 4, one or two discal blue spots and very incomplete subterminal and terminal series of similar spots.

He kept that position until the end of the First World War. Biography Marshall was born the village of Stranton, near Hartlepool, County Durham. He was the younger son of solicitor William Marshall and his wife, Elizabeth (n√©e Raine). He first went to Repton School and then Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He received a commission into the Sherwood Foresters in 1886, after which he served on the Malakand expedition, on the North West Frontier and on the Tirah expedition before fighting in the Second Boer War. Following the end of the war, in late May 1902, Marshall received a brevet promotion to lieutenant-colonel in the South African Honours list published on 26 June 1902. Commanding Officer of 1st Battalion Sherwood Foresters on the Western Front during 1914‚Äì15, Marshall was then posted to command 87th brigade of 29th Division in the ill-fated expedition to Gallipoli, during which he received a promotion to Major-General in June 1915. A series of divisional commands followed: 42nd, 29th, and 53rd, before he was posted to Salonika with 27th Division, and then with III (Indian) Corps on the Mesopotamian Front. It was while commanding III Corps that Marshall participated in the capture of Kut-al-Amara in February 1917, and in the capture of Baghdad the following month. With Sir Frederick Maude's death as Commander-in-Chief from cholera (most probably from contaminated milk), the hugely popular commander was replaced by the careful and meticulous Marshall, appointed by Sir William Robertson at the War Office in London, the latter determined to scale back operations in Mesopotamia. It was in this capacity that Marshall accepted the surrender of the Ottoman army at Mosul on 30 October 1918, with the signing of the Armistice of Mudros. His decision to seize Ottoman territory around Mosul after the ceasefire is controversial, the Official History makes no mention of this action and is explained in a 2017 article. His post-war career took him back to India commanding the Southern Army and remaining there until 1923; he retired the following year. Marshall was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1916. He was knighted three times ‚Äì as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (1917), Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (1918) and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (1919) He died at Le Grand H√¥tel, Bagnoles-de-l'Orne, France. He was survived by his wife, Emma Cundell, whom he married in 1902. References Further reading * Marshall, Lieutenant General Sir William, Memories of Four Fronts.

The species was first described by Frederic Moore in 1858. Description left Male: Forewing very variable in shape, especially in the outline of the termen and dorsum. In the type it is comparatively long in proportion to width owing to the less convexity of the dorsal margin, and has the termen oblique, slightly convex; in var. novarae it is remarkably broad, the great convexity of the dorsal margin making it almost subquadrate, while the termen is more convex than in the typical form. In the female the difference is less marked. Typical form. Upperside: forewing dark brown suffused up to the termen with a brilliant blue gloss; a spot in apex of cell, a small costal spot, two short streaks beyond apex of cell, and in the female two discal spots: in the six subterminal and terminal series of spots; in the female the latter series wanting: in both sexes the subterminal spots produced inwards. All the spots bluish white.

This character was the protagonist of the film's promotional material, appearing on a bed with cigarette in hand.  Fictional biography  = In \\"Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife\\" = Mia is the wife of crime boss Marsellus Wallace. Before meeting Marsellus, Mia was an aspiring actress who appeared in a television pilot called Fox Force Five, which failed. Marsellus goes out of town and asks Vincent Vega, one of his assassins, to take Mia out to dinner while he's gone. Vincent agrees, although he is worried about how it will look; when asked about taking her out, he repeatedly insists that \\"it's not a date\\". His friend and fellow hit man Jules Winnfield warns him not to forget his place, and tells him a story about Antwan \\"Tony Rocky Horror\\" Rockamora, one of Marcellus' men whom Marcellus threw out of a four-story window, supposedly because he gave Mia a foot massage. When Vincent goes to pick Mia up at Marcellus's lavish house, she speaks to him over the intercom as she snorts cocaine in a separate room. The two then head to dinner at Jack Rabbit Slim's, a 1950s-themed restaurant. During dinner, Mia and Vincent talk about subjects such as awkward silences, 50's pop culture, and some gossip related to Vincent's mob. When Vincent brings up what happened to Rockamora, Mia says that \\"The only thing Tony ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it on my wedding day\\". Suddenly, the restaurant's DJ announces a twist contest, and Mia wants to win the trophy for first place. Though Vincent is reluctant, he gets up and dances The Twist with Mia to Chuck Berry's \\"You Never Can Tell\\". When Mia and Vincent return to the house to celebrate, Vincent goes to the bathroom while Mia dances to some music. While Vincent contemplates what to do next in the bathroom, Mia finds a small bag of heroin inside Vincent's coat pocket, and snorts it, thinking that it's cocaine. When Vincent returns from the bathroom he finds Mia overdosing on the couch, and frantically drives her to the house of his heroin dealer Lance, in an effort to save her. Lance gets a needle full of adrenaline, and has Vincent administer it directly into Mia's heart, which instantly wakes her up and saves her life. The two return to the Wallace house after the overdose. Embarrassed, Mia asks Vincent not to tell Marsellus about what happened, as it would surely mean big trouble for both of them. = In \\"The Gold Watch\\" = When the boxer Butch Coolidge double-crosses Marcellus by winning a rigged fight, Marcellus sends Vincent to kill him.

He also served as Viceroy of New Spain (colonial M√©xico), from January 15, 1711 to August 15, 1716. Early career Alencastre Noro√±a y Silva was a descendant of Fernando de Noro√±a, Duke of Linares, and thus from a distinguished Spanish family with origins in the Portuguese nobility. In addition to the two titles he inherited, he was knight commander of the Order of Santiago, lord of the bedchamber of the king, and lieutenant general in the army. He was also knight commander of the royal arms in the Kingdom of Naples, honorary viceroy of Sardinia, and vicar general of La Toscana. Alencastre was an early donor to the Jesuit missions in Baja California, providing 5,000 reales as seed money in 1697.Alegre, Francisco Javier. ([1766], 1960). Historia de la Provincia de la Compan~√≠a de Jesus de Nueva Espan~a. Nueva edici√≥n por Ernest J. Burrus y Felix Zubillaga. Roma: Insitutum Historicum S.J.; Vol. 4, pp. 3*, 252-53. Viceroy of New Spain In 1711 Fernando de Alencastre became the colonial viceroy and captain general of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, and president of the Audiencia Real. On August 16, 1711 there was a strong earthquake that damaged many buildings and resulted in significant loss of life. The earthquake was said to last half an hour. The viceroy is said to have paid from his own funds to help the poor and to restore some of the buildings. In 1713, Mexico City experienced a snowfall unlike any earlier recorded. The harvest failed, and a severe famine resulted. The streets were filled with people begging for bread. Perhaps as a result of the famine, a severe plague broke out, continuing into the following year. Many sick people were abandoned on the streets. Many people died and were buried in common graves. Both the viceroy and the archbishop of Mexico, Jos√© Lanziego, reportedly paid from their own funds to help the poor during these catastrophes. Portrait of Alencastre Alencastre ordered the construction of four well-armed, light warships at Coatzacoalcos to reinforce the Armada de Barlovento (coast guard). He bought 600 new muskets in Cantabria for the militia, and sent money for the repair of fortifications at Cuman√°. =Spanish shipping trade= Around 1711 Alencastre authored a proposal to the Council of the Indies (Consejo de Indias) in Spain to legitimize private trade between the Viceroyalty of New Spain and the Viceroyalty of Peru between their Pacific Ocean ports. Spain had supplied Peru by bringing goods by government fleet to the Atlantic port of Portobelo in Panama, from whence they were carted to Lima overland. There was no direct trade allowed between the Spanish colonies. However, the Spanish government fleet did not arrive for eleven years between 1696 and 1707, nor between 1708 and 1711. The problem was caused the War of the Spanish Succession, making it difficult for the Spanish fleet to cross the Atlantic. In their place, the French were sailing from Saint Malo in France, around South America's Cape Horn, to the seaport of Callao in Peru. At Callao, the French sold European merchandise for Peruvian silver, and then sailed to Asia trading the silver for Asian products (spices and especially textiles), and then returning to Callao to sell the Asian goods for silver and/or cacao, and then returning to France. Viceroy Alencastre suggested that Spain permit private Spanish merchant ships to sail between the Pacific ports of Acapulco and Callao. In Acapulco, they could pick up Asian goods shipped on the Spanish government's Manila galleons, and they could also purchase European goods shipped on the Spanish government's Atlantic fleet to Veracruz and brought across Mexico. Alencastre pointed out that banning Spanish merchants in the Americas from trading between Acapulco (New Spain) and Callao (Peru) was simply making French merchants wealthy.Mariano Ardash Bonialian, El Pacifico Hispanoamericano, politica y comercio asiatico en el imperio espanol (1680-1784). (Mexico City, 2012), 100-119. The Council of the Indies rejected the idea, hinting that Viceroy Alencastre himself might be profiting from Pacific trade: ::::::\\"without the toleration of the Viceroys, governors, and ministers of those Kingdoms [New Spain and Peru], the perpetrators of fraud could not continue business with their goods with the freedom and openness with which they have done so in recent years.\\"quoted in Bonialian, El Pacifico Hispanoamericano, 113 Viceroy of New Spain, by Juan Rodriguez Juarez =Foreign affairs= The Spanish enslavement of Africans to the New Spain had been authorized by the Catholic Monarchs in 1501. As part of ending the War of the Spanish Succession 1713, the Spanish Crown granted the Asiento slaving contract for 30 years to the British South Sea Company, a monopoly in the slave trade of African slaves to the Americas. Besides continuing slavery, the contract had the unintended effect of allowing the English to trade large quantities of unauthorized goods and merchandise directly with the Spanish colonies as well. The longstanding British settlement at Laguna de T√©rminos was another issue, which continued the illegal harvest of tropical woods, especially the Logwood trees, by the English. =Internal affairs and new settlements= The pueblo of San Felipe de Linares was founded by Sebasti√°n Villegas Cumplido in September 1711, and named in honor of the Viceroy. It is located in present-day state of Nuevo Le√≥n. The viceroy authorized expeditions in 1716 and in 1718, to reoccupy the Spanish Texas territory after its abandonment in 1690, and establish missions and a settlement there. The pueblo of San Antonio was founded in 1718. He also authorized establishing missions in Nuevo Mexico, present day New Mexico. The indigenous and sophisticated Pueblo peoples continued in revolt against the occupation of their homeland, taken by the Spanish in 1598 as the Province of Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico. In 1711 Father Eusebio Kino, renowned explorer and missionary in Sonora, Baja California and Alta California, died in Magdelena, Sonora. Alencastre constructed the aqueduct of Arcos de Bel√©n to Salto de Agua in Mexico City. He continued and expanded La , a special tribunal dedicated to fighting robbery in the cities and on the highways. He prohibited the manufacture of the alcoholic beverage aguardiente from sugar cane, and made attempts to suppress immorality among the regular clergy. The Crown fixed the annual contribution of New Spain to the mother country at one million pesos. To raise this money required some ingenuity on the part of the viceroy. On October 28, 1715 an insurrection broke out among the garrison at San Juan de Ul√∫a, near Veracruz. For two years the soldiers had received only partial pay. The rebels were tried, convicted, and pardoned. Afterwards they continued to press their grievances. Alencastre founded the first public library and the first natural history museum in New Spain. King Philip V of Spain directed that the museum send to Spain samples of rocks, plants, fruits, animals and other things found in Mexico but unknown in Spain. The viceroy complied, copiously. Retirement and death In 1716 he turned over the office to his successor, Baltasar de Z√∫√±iga, 1st Duke of Ari√≥n. He left for Z√∫√±iga a written Instrucci√≥n, in which he detailed the sad social and economic conditions of the colony. He died the following year in Mexico City, and was interred in the church of the Discalced Carmelites. He left many charitable donations in his will, including an addition 5,000 for the Jesuit missions of Baja California.Alegre, 1960, v. 4:252-53.

Pendleton Herring was an American political scientist who worked to advance the field of political science with his work as president of the American Political Science Association (APSA). In addition to working as the 48th president of the APSA Pendleton Herring also served as secretary of Graduate education for Public Administration at Harvard. Pendleton's scholarly works had a large impact on American political science and also influenced the American government acting as chief intellectual architect of the National Security Act of 1947, which culminated in the reorganization of the military and intelligence branches of the federal government including the creation of the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency. Herring is considered one of the most important political scientist of his generation and his influence has helped shaped political science as behavioral science. Life and education Born in Baltimore Maryland on October 27, 1903 to parents Dr. Arthur Pendleton Herring and Agnes Kinney Herring, Edward Pendleton Herring was one of six children. Edward Pendleton Herring later dropped his first name preferring to be called his middle name. In 1913 Pendleton Herring attended Woodrow Wilson's inauguration which created a lasting impression for Herring leading him into a career in political science. Pendleton Herring attended Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland and received his bachelor's degree in English in 1925. Pendleton then attended graduate school to receive his Ph.D in Political Science which he received in 1928. During his time in graduate school Pendleton was taught constitutional law by Frank J. Goodnow, the first president of the American Political Science Association. During his graduate studies Herring wrote a dissertation titled Group Representation Before Congress, which studied the effects of pressure groups in government. Pendleton's work was published in 1929 and became one of the primary studies regarding pressure groups and political behavior. In 1933 Pendleton Herring married Katherine Channing. Pendleton and his wife had two children H. James Herring and Thomas S. Herring. In 1969 Pendleton's wife Katherine died and Herring remarried in 1971 to Virgina Staman Wood. E. Pendleton Herring died at the age of 100 from pneumonia on August 17, 2004 at his home in Princeton New Jersey.  Career  = Harvard = Pendleton Herring started working at Harvard University in the fall of 1928, where he worked in the Government Department. In 1936 Pendleton was appointed as secretary of Harvard's newly created Graduate School of Public Administration where he helped to develop its teaching programs. During Pendleton's tenure at Harvard he published six books, his first being the previously mentioned Group Representation Before Congress which was published in 1929. Public Administration and the Public Interest which was Pendletons second book and Federal Commissioners: A Study of Their Careers and Qualifications, Pendleton's third book, both were published in 1938. Both books dealt with the topic of public administration which was Herrings focus as the secretary of the Graduate School of Public Administration. Herring's next to books Presidential Leadership: The Political Relations of Congress and the Chief Executive and The Politics of Democracy: American Political Parties in Action were both in 1940. Herring's final book written during his tenure at Harvard was titled The Impact of War: Our American Democracy under Arms which was published in 1941. The Impact of War came to the attention of Ferdinand Eberstadt who was a member of the War Production Board. The two collaborated on a way to combine the military branches of the government under one administrative organization and the two were considered the intellectual architects of National Security Act of 1947 which created The National Security Council the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency. In 1945 after the war Pendleton resigned from his position at Harvard and accepted an offer to work for the Carnegie Corporation. = Social Science Research Council = In 1948 Pendleton Herring became president of the Social Science Research Council. During his twenty-year presidency the SSRC became one of the leading organizations in the advancement of social science. Herring's goals were to increase the quality of research by taking better information and analyzing it with stricter methods. Pendleton also strived to make the information available to policy makers to aid in decision making. During Pendletons twenty year presidency the SSRC budget was quadrupled from less than $500,000 to $2,000,000 annually. Pedleton Herring presidency drew many leading scholars to the SSRC to serve on boards and committees. In 1962 during his presidency Pendleton Herring also became the president of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation and in 1968 Herring retired from the SSRC. = Woodrow Wilson Foundation = In 1968 E. Pendleton Herring became the president of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation. As president of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation Pendleton was active in persuading the Johnson administration and the Congress to create the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars which was built in Washington, D.C.. Herring also help with the project of publishing The Papers of Woodrow Wilson. Herring served as president of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation for nearly thirty years.

In 1946 Pendleton received the Navy Citation and Distinguished Civilian Service Award in 1946 for his efforts with Ferdinand Eberstadt and his study on combining the military branches. Pendleton also received the Charles E. Merriam award in 1979 for his work in public service and the James Madison Award in 1987 in for his scholarship.

The song's name is a pun on El C√≥ndor Pasa. The name El Condor is a fictional code name for the United States F-117 Nighthawk stealth bomber, one of which was shot down during the war. The lyrics tell the story of a fictional American pilot. He is tricked into believing that the mission is perfectly safe, as his bomber is \\"invisible\\" to radar. The song continues by relating the story of his flight and subsequent downing by Yugoslav anti-aircraft defences. The pilot is evacuated with 32 helicopters after having been searched for by peasants with pitchforks. The song also emphasises the supposed ignorance of NATO troops about Kosovo, describing them as not even knowing where it exactly is. Indexovo radio pozori≈°te, a performing group originally formed at the leading local public radio station in Belgrade, Beograd 202, was very prominent in Serbia due to a series of politically engaged, anti-Milo≈°eviƒá theatre plays.

The conference was held annually in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Future Play 2008 was hosted by Algoma and UOIT, each year bringing together key players from academics, industry, and government to advance game design and technology. The conference focused on three themes: Future game development, future game impacts and application, future game talent. These issues were addressed through keynotes from leaders in academia and industry, peer-reviewed paper sessions, panel sessions, workshops, and exhibitions of posters, games, and the latest game technologies and supports from industry vendors. Academic competitions =Games competition= The Future Play Game Exhibition and Competition allows academic, independent, experimental, and/or student developers to gain recognition for their game- related work in a juried competition. Developers can submit to the exhibition in the following categories: * Future Games: this category is for games that experiment with new game technologies or design concepts. * Future Game Impacts and Applications: this category is for games that are built not necessarily for pure entertainment purposes (i.e. serious games), such as games that are for learning purposes. * Future Game Talent: this category is primarily for students who have built an original, entertainment game title who wish to show off their talents, earn publicity for their school, gain personal recognition, and perhaps even find a publisher for the game.

He was one of the most celebrated of the Irish Catholic Martyrs, and was beatified by Pope John Paul II on 27 September 1992. Biography =Early life= O'Hurley was born in Lickadoon Castle, Ballyneety, County Limerick, around the year 1530. his father, William, was the O'Hurley clan's Chief of the Name and steward to James FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Desmond. The O'Hurley clan claims descent from the D√°l gCais, one of the more powerful Irish clans in Munster's history. O'Hurley was educated by tutors and then sent to Flemish Brabant to study at the University of Leuven. In 1551 he graduated with a Master of Arts degree, then a doctorate of Law and was appointed a professor of philosophy in one of that university‚Äôs greater colleges, where he remained for 15 years. In 1574 he was appointed a professor of canon and civil law in the Faculty of Law of Reims University, at which he spent 4 years. =Fugitive archbishop= In 1570 Pope Pius V excommunicated Queen Elizabeth I of England in the papal bull Regnans in Excelsis. This led to the Second Desmond Rebellion in 1579-83, which was still in progress when O'Hurley was required to travel to Ireland. On 11 September 1581, while still a layman, he was appointed Archbishop of Cashel by Pope Gregory XIII. He was ordained and consecrated and set out on his mission in 1583. O'Hurley's voyage was fraught with danger because of the state of war between the Pope and England, but he accepted the risks involved and arranged for a sea captain from Drogheda to smuggle him into Ireland. He disembarked on Holmpatrick Strand in County Dublin in the autumn of 1583. His letters, which had been sent via a different ship, were intercepted by priest hunters. Through its elaborate spy system, the government in Dublin had knowledge of Dermot's appointment to the See of Cashel, and Elizabeth's spies were soon on his tracks. He never reached Cashel. O'Hurley lodged with Thomas Fleming, 10th Baron Slane, at Slane, and from there he spread his activities through the territory of the O'Reilly clan. While sheltering at Slane Castle he was recognised. Under pain of severe penalties Fleming was ordered to arrest O'Hurley who had by then left Slane. O'Hurley was arrested at Carrick- on-Suir in September 1583, while staying with Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond, a Protestant, referred to as ' (the black), who was the Lord Treasurer of Ireland at the time. Butler was much offended and distressed at the arrest, and afterwards did his best to rescue O'Hurley from the executioners. On 8 October 1583 O'Hurley was imprisoned in Dublin Castle. =Martyrdom= Upon his arrest, his interrogators claimed that he had been a member of the Roman Inquisition. However, no documents of his activities there survive. St. Kevin's in Camden Row, burial place of O'Hurley Despite severe torture, which included having his legs boiled over a roaring fire, O'Hurley refused to embrace Protestantism. According to surviving correspondence between Dublin and Whitehall, Elizabeth I was reluctant to dispense with a fair trial under English Law, but her mind was changed by Sir Francis Walsingham and she approved of a trial by military tribunal. O'Hurley was tried in a day and sentenced to death. The Chancellor, learning that Butler was coming, by whose influence and power they feared O'Hurley would be saved, determined to put him to death as soon as possible. In the early morning of 19, or 20, June 1584, O'Hurley was taken outside the walls of Dublin and hanged at Hoggen Green. In his last speech, he proclaimed, He was buried in St. Kevin's Church, Camden Row, Dublin. His gravesite remained a site of pilgrimage for many years. Legacy As word of his execution spread, O'Hurley was immediately revered as a martyr by Catholics throughout Europe. Several accounts of his life and death were printed and reached a wide audience. Following Catholic Emancipation in the 19th century, Ireland's Roman Catholic hierarchy began an investigation into his life and death. One of the most valuable resources was found to be the documents and letters written by the men who tortured and executed him. In 1904, he was declared a Servant of God. On 27 September 1992, O'Hurley was beatified by Pope John Paul II, alongside 16 other Irish martyrs.

The tied-arch bridge carries two lanes in each direction of Interstate 70 (I-70), U.S. Route 40 (US 40), and US 250\\\\. The bridge opened after four years of construction work on September 8, 1955, costing $6.8 million, $1.8 million over budget. The bridge, along with the aging Wheeling Suspension Bridge, are the only two road links from Wheeling Island to downtown Wheeling. In 2009, the structure carried an average of over 60,000 vehicles per day. Description The long tied-arch bridge carries four lanes of concurrent highways I-70, US 40 and US 250 over the main channel of the Ohio River between Wheeling Island and downtown Wheeling, West Virginia. The bridge is the easternmost portion of a long chain of elevated structures spanning Wheeling Creek in Ohio, the Ohio River back channel, Wheeling Island, and the main channel. To the east of the bridge after an interchange in downtown Wheeling, I-70 and US 250 enter the Wheeling Tunnel. Besides the Wheeling Suspension Bridge, the Fort Henry Bridge is the only fixed connection from Wheeling Island to mainland West Virginia. The bridge is named after Fort Henry, which in turn was named after Patrick Henry, the governor of Virginia Territory at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. Truck traffic is prohibited from using the Wheeling Suspension Bridge and must take the Fort Henry Bridge to cross between downtown Wheeling and Wheeling Island. The bridge is owned and maintained by the State of West Virginia. Every year, the West Virginia Department of Transportation (WVDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2009, WVDOT calculated that 60,070 vehicles used the Fort Henry Bridge over the main channel of the Ohio River. This represents a 334 percent increase in traffic from 1956, the first year traffic data was published, when 18,000 vehicles used the bridge. History Contracts to build the Fort Henry Bridge were let to the American Bridge Company, a subsidiary of U.S. Steel, and Dravo Corporation of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Costing $6.8 million, $1.8 million over budget, and taking four years to complete, the Fort Henry Bridge opened to traffic on September 8, 1955 after a ribbon-cutting ceremony with then- governor William C. Marland in front of a crowd of 55,000 to 60,000 people. The bridge earned an Honorable Mention in 1955 from the National Steel Bridge Alliance, a part of the American Institute of Steel Construction, which recognizes the best steel bridges of the year. At the time of construction, the bridge was only the second tied-arch bridge across the Ohio River. The bridge was originally named the Ninth Street Bridge, and was designed to relieve traffic on the National Road's Wheeling Suspension Bridge. The roadway as originally opened carried four lanes with a median between each direction. During the first years of the bridge it carried US 40 and US 250 from Wheeling Island over the Ohio River main channel. In 1957 plans to add an Interstate Highway designation to the bridge were formed, with the Interstate 70 designation added by 1966. The bridge underwent a renovation in 1990 which included replacement of its bridge deck. The bridge, along with the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge and the Wheeling Suspension bridge were all closed in January 2005, stopping any traffic from Ohio or Wheeling Island from entering mainland West Virginia for an hour due to barges breaking loose during heavy flooding along the Ohio River.

Freedman as Herself is a 1977 young adult novel by Judy Blume. The story is set in 1947 and follows the imaginative 10-year-old Sally, who likes to make up stories in her head, her family moves from New Jersey to Miami Beach. While not as controversial as some of her other novels, Blume does manage to address the following themes of late 1940s life in America: racism, anti-Semitism and sibling rivalry. This novel is her most autobiographical, with many parallels between Blume's own life and that of Sally. Blume has said, \\"Sally is the kind of kid I was at ten.\\" Plot Sally J. Freedman moves from New Jersey to Miami, Florida with her brother and their mother and grandmother at the end of World War II. This is because of her brother Douglas's health, for he caught nephritis from staying in wet clothes in the cold. The novel first touches on racism when, on the train to Florida, Sally meets a black woman traveling with her young sons about Sally's age and her infant daughter whom Sally gets to hold. The next day, Sally goes back to visit the black family and discovers that laws requiring racial segregation in the 1940s in the Southern United States force the family to move to another car on the train. Sally is infuriated and does not understand why her mother is not upset as well. Before Sally can be admitted to her new school, she must undergo a physical examination in which the school nurse discovers nits (head louse eggs) in Sally's hair. The school nurse tries to calm Sally's mother, who is insulted and taking the news personally, by saying, \\"Look Mrs. Freedman, don't take this personally. You've been traveling, she could have picked them up anywhere.\\" In her new school, she meets new friends, the first being Barbara, who teaches Sally all about the new school. Later, she meets Andrea, a sixth grader, and Shelby, a girl in a different class than Sally. She has a difficult first day at school, but after a while, she begins to make more friends. There, she meets Peter Hornstein, a so-called 'Latin Lover', who seems to like Sally, but Peter ignores Sally when Jackie, a new girl, arrives at the school. It troubles Sally that Peter is going after a different girl, and she begins to like Peter back. She also meets Harriet Goodman, who takes an instant disliking of her simply because she's a \\"snowbird\\". A central part in the story is when Sally meets a man named Mr. Zavodsky, who lives in her building in Miami. He offers Andrea and her candy. Sally refuses the candy even though Andrea accepts it, which makes Sally upset. Sally, who is Jewish, notices that Mr. Zavodsky looks similar to Adolf Hitler and comes to believe (because of her active imagination) that he is actually Hitler, in disguise and retiring in Miami. Another important plotline is when Sally finds out that her father, who had just turned 42, was exactly the same age as his two brothers had been when they died. Sally, who is superstitious, is worried that her father may die in his 42nd year, because of the well-known superstition 'all bad things happen in threes'. Sally writes (but never mails) a lot of letters to Mr. Zavodsky, always saying she will get him someday. She spies on him, secretly listening to their phone conversations on a party line. She worries at one point Mr. Zavodsky killed her friend Shelby, and she believes the rock candy he offers is actually poison. In the end, Mr. Zavodsky dies of a heart attack. In the one year Sally spends at Miami, she learns how babies are made, attends but loses a contest, drinks whiskey while attempting to make Creme de Cacao, kisses Peter at their teacher's wedding, and in the end, strengthens her relationship with her family members. At the very end, Sally and her family return to New Jersey. Themes This historical novel focuses on a young adolescent growing up in the post-World War II United States. Other themes include sibling rivalry, making friends, bigotry and antisemitism. Numerous references are made to technology and cultural events in post-World War II America such as party telephone lines and rotary phones, train travel instead of plane travel, and rationing. Racial segregation is also noted in this book, both from the above-mentioned situation on the train with the black family, and another incident where Sally inadvertently drank from a \\"colored\\" drinking fountain in a drug store and a woman pulled her off it and freaked out over what she might \\"catch\\" from it.

Traditionally after the Easter service, the kulich, which has been put into a basket and decorated with colorful flowers, is blessed by the priest. Blessed kulich is eaten before breakfast each day. Any leftover kulich that is not blessed is eaten with paskha for dessert. Kulich is baked in tall, cylindrical tins (like coffee or fruit juice tins).

He was Professor of Political, Constitutional, Administrative and Economic History at the University of Berlin.  Biography  Hintze was born in the small town of Pyritz (Pyrzyce) in the Province of Pomerania, the son of a civil servant. From 1878 to 1879, Hintze studied history, philosophy and philology in Greifswald. Here he joined the fraternity Germania. Hintze came to Berlin in 1880, and soon obtained a doctorate under Julius Weizs√§cker with a dissertation on Medieval History in 1884. He joined the project on the ‚ÄòActa Borussica‚Äô, an editing project of the Prussian Academy of Sciences under the directorship of Gustav Schmoller dealing with the Prussian administrative files of the 18th century. Seven volumes of sources on the economics and administrative organisation in Prussia, with detailed historical commentaries, were published by 1910. In 1895, his post- doctoral thesis to become a lecturer was accepted by Treitschke and Schmoller; in 1902 as Professor of the newly created Department of Political, Constitutional, Administrative and Economic History. In 1912, Hintze married his student Hedwig Guggenheimer. One of his key works, Die Hohenzollern und ihr Werk (The Hohenzollern and Their Legacy), is considered to be an important and solidly researched piece of scholarship, despite having been commissioned by the Prussian Hohenzollern dynasty for their ruling anniversary in 1915.Sehepunkte - Rezensionsjournal f√ºr die Geschichtswissenschaften ‚Äì 8 (2008), Nr. 6 at sehepunkte.de Hintze was prematurely retired from the university in 1920 due to health reasons.

His wife, Hedwig Hintze (born: Hedwig Guggenheimer), who was Germany's first woman to receive a doctorate in History and the University of Berlin's (Friedrich Wilhelm University) first woman History professor,Biography of Hedwig Hintze (1884‚Äì1942) at geschichte.hu-berlin.de because of her Jewish roots and leftist sympathies soon lost her position as lecturer at the Friedrich Wilhelm University, and eventually had to flee to the Netherlands in 1939. Otto Hintze only survived this separation for a few months. In 1942, his wife committed suicide rather than undergo deportation to a death camp by the Nazis. Since the 1960s, there has been deeper research into Hintze's oeuvre, as signified by Gerhard Oestreich‚Äôs detailed new work on him. The historians J√ºrgen Kocka and Felix Gilbert agree that, in their opinion, he could possibly be the most significant German historian of the German Empire and of the Weimar Republic.see Andreas Daum, ed. \\"German Historiography in Transatlantic Perspective: Interview with Hans-Ulrich Wehler\\"  Works  * Das K√∂nigtums Wilhelms von Holland, Leipzig 1885 * Die Preu√üische Seidenindustrie im 18.

He set up a new attitude to classical traditions, rejecting well-trodden ways in poetry. The artistic thought of the Azerbaijani people found expression in Fuz√ªl√Æ's works. They have been examples of the lyric to this day, and the satirical trend in Azerbaijani literature, and especially in poetry.  Life  Mirza Alakbar Sabir was born on May 30, 1862 in Shamakhi into a poor family. At that time the religion Islam dominated in the society. His mother, Saltanat, was a true Muslim believer. His father Zeynalabdin Tahirzadeh was a merchant. He had 7 sisters and a brother. He received his primary education in a theological school. Sabir was brought up in a patriarchal-religious atmosphere. In 1874, when he was twelve years old, Alakbar entered the school of Seyid Azim Shirvani, a poet and teacher, where unlike traditional schools, general education subjects, as well as the languages of Azerbaijani and Russian were taught. At that time, this school was considered very progressive. Personal contacts with this man greatly influenced the formation of Sabir as a poet. Encouraged by Seyid Azim, Sabir began translating [works written in Persian by Azerbaijani (Turk) poets] and wrote poems in Azerbaijani (Azerbaijani Turkish language). On April 11, 1908, the poet, who took exams at the Spiritual Department of the Baku Province, went to Tiflis and received a diploma for a mother tongue and a Shariah teacher from the Caucasian Sheikh-ul-Islam Office. However, after a letter he received from Gori, he worked for some time as an assistant teacher in a Shamakhi school. In September of that year, Sabir was able to open \\"Umid\\" school. There were about 60 students in this school. As in other new schools, students are sitting on the bench, using visual aids, and taking short excursions. At the school, the mother tongue, the Persian language, geography, and nature, as well as the Quran and Sharia lessons were taught. Mirza Alekper Sabir died July 12, 1911, in the prime of his creative power. Sabir was buried in his hometown of Shamakhi in the cemetery \\"Yeddi Gumbez\\" (\\"Seven domes\\"), at the foot of the hill.A monument of Mirza Alakbar Sabir. The statue, sculpted by J. Garyagdy, is located in a park adjacent to the walls of the Old City in Baku. Throughout all his life poverty impacted Sabir. He was bound to take care of his family's welfare, barely earning a living for himself and his household. No time was left for literary activity, the more so as the spectre of poverty took more and more distinct shape. Sabir tried to become a merchant but did not succeed. Instead, he travelled a lot about Central Asia and the Middle East.  Career  Mirza Alakbar Sabir revealed his poetic talent at a very young age. When he was eight years old, he wrote his first poem. His works reflected both positive and negative features of life in Azerbaijan. In the early years, he wrote only lyrical ghazals, elegy, laudatory and mourning poems. His first work was printed in 1903 in the newspaper \\"Shargi-Rus\\" (\\"Russian East\\"). Between 1903 and 1905, Sabir collaborated in several newspapers and magazines such as \\"Debistan\\" (Sad School), \\"Zenbur\\" (Ovod), \\"Irshad\\" (Guide), \\"Hagigat\\" and \\"Hayat\\" (Life). In 1900, after studying abroad, the modern-minded young poet Abbas Sahhat returned to Shamakhi, in whose house the local intelligentsia often gathers. Sabir attracted the attention of Abbas Sahhat and they began a close friendship that lasted until the death of Sabir. Abbas Sahhat, appreciating Sabir's talent, always encouraged and supported him. The Russian Revolution of 1905 had a powerful effect on Sabir's writing, infusing it with a revolutionary spirit. This revolution, which was followed by the spreading of democratic trends throughout the Russian Empire, marked the beginning of a new era in Sabir's literary activity. The shock waves of upheaval brought about a host of satirical publications. The most prominent of them was the Molla Nasraddin magazine, which was popular all over the Caucasus, Middle East and Central Asia, its publisher being Jalil Mammadguluzadeh. Sabir's best, most creative mature years are associated with this publication. His pen did not miss a single political event, a single problem typical for the still the feudal- patriarchal Azerbaijani society and he embodied his ideas in stirring, thought-provoking images. He took an active part in the activity of the journal, exposing the negative sites of the society in his poems, passionately condemning the behaviour and actions of the rich people. He wrote about the arbitrariness of Tsarist officials, landowners and beys ignorant to their people, the backwardness of the clergy, the down-trodden status of women and the social situation of the working people. Sabir contributed significantly to the revolutionary movement in Iran and Turkey between 1905 and 1910. In his poems, he caustically criticized the regime of Sultan Abdul-Hamid and Mohammed Ali Shah. Realism, socio-political lyricism and keen satire - these are the main elements that characterize the work of Sabir, who played a revolutionizing role in educating the young generation. Sabir's poetry won him the people's respect and popularity, at the same time, placing him in a very risky and dangerous position. He was exposed to persecution, attacks and insults of the officials, mullahs and qochus (bouncers), who threatened him with reprisals. That's why Sabir (this pen-name means patience) had more than fifty pen-names such as Mirat, Fazil, Aglar-Guleghen and others. But even this could not help him escape from persecution. One of his earliest pseudonyms was ‚ÄúHop-Hop‚Äù, which means the name of a type of bird. For the first time in Azerbaijani literature, Sabir‚Äôs social satires raised the issue of class oppression. The political satires reflected the dispersal of the State Duma in Russia, the intrigues of autocracy against the liberation movement in the countries of the Middle East, the intrigues of international reaction. In social satires, ‚ÄúWhat do we need?‚Äù, ‚ÄúCrying‚Äù, ‚ÄúBeggar‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat do I have to do?‚Äù, ‚ÄúComplaint of the old man‚Äù and others, Sabir, for the first time in the Azerbaijani literature, raised the question of inequality in society. Poverty, overstrain, endless cares of his large family and persecution adversely affected his health. He boiled soap for a living and was often ill. In 1910 Sabir's disease of the liver took a serious turn that turned out to be irreversible. Even when ill, Sabir continued to write. Not long before his death, he said to his friends who stood at his bedside: \\"I laid my flesh down for my people. But if God would give me more time, I would lay my bones down too...\\"  Hophopname  After his death, in honour of Sabir's memory, his wife Bullurnise, and his friends Abbas Sahhat and M. Mahmudbeyov collected Sabir\`s poems and published them under the name \\"Hophopname\\" in 1912. Two years later, the second, better edition of the ‚ÄúHophopname‚Äù was released by the people. Using a wide range of expressive means, some of which were introduced by him to Azerbaijani poetry for the first time, Sabir made a gallery of social types of carriers of various vices of ignorance, inertia, and moneymakers who betrayed the interests of the people in this book. Sabir‚Äôs poems, his caustic epigrams, verbal self-character portraits appeared on the pages of Molla Nasreddin magazine with colorful illustrations by the artist Azim Azimzade and became the property of an international reader, as the magazine was received in the cities of Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Egypt, India, and other countries.

It usually appears as a white deliquescent powder.

Sodium formate is also unavoidably formed as a by-product in the final step of the pentaerythritol synthesis and in the crossed Cannizzaro reaction of formaldehyde with the aldol reaction product trimethylol acetaldehyde [3-hydroxy-2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propanal].H.-J. Arpe, Industrielle Organische Chemie, 6., vollst. √ºberarb. Aufl., Wiley-VCH Verlag, 2007, In the laboratory, sodium formate can be prepared by neutralizing formic acid with sodium carbonate.

Sodium formate is slightly water-hazardous and inhibits some species of bacteria but is degraded by others. Uses Sodium formate is used in several fabric dyeing and printing processes. It is also used as a buffering agent for strong mineral acids to increase their pH, as a food additive (E237), and as a de-icing agent. In structural biology, sodium formate can be used as a cryoprotectant for X-ray diffraction experiments on protein crystals, which are typically conducted at a temperature of 100 K to reduce the effects of radiation damage. Sodium formate plays a role in the synthesis of formic acid, it is converted by sulfuric acid via the following reaction equation: :\\\\mathrm{2\\\\ HCOONa + H_2SO_4 \\\\longrightarrow 2\\\\ HCOOH + Na_2SO_4} :Sodium formate is converted with sulfuric acid to formic acid and sodium sulfate. The urticating hair of stinging nettles contain sodium formate as well as formic acid. Solid sodium formate is used as a non-corrosive agent at airports for de-icing of runways in mix with corrosion inhibitors and other additives, which rapidly penetrate solid snow and ice layers, detach them from the asphalt or concrete and melt the ice rapidly. Sodium formate was also used as a road deicer in the city of Ottawa from 1987 to 1988. The high freezing point depression e.g. in comparison to the still frequently used urea (which is effective but problematic due to eutrophication) effectively prevents the re-icing, even at temperatures below ‚àí15 ¬∞C. The thawing effect of the solid sodium formate can even be increased by moistening with aqueous potassium formate or potassium acetate solutions. The degradability of sodium formate is particularly advantageous with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 211 mg O2/g compared with the de-icing agents sodium acetate (740 mg O2/g) and urea with (> 2,000 mg O2/g).Deicer Anti-icing Snow melting Thawing Chemicals Manufacturers Saturated sodium formate solutions (as well as mixtures of other alkali metal formates such as potassium and cesium formate) are used as important drilling and stabilizing aids in gas and oil exploration because of their relatively high density. By mixing the corresponding saturated alkali metal formate solutions any densities between 1,0 and 2,3 g/cm3 can be set. The saturated solutions are biocidal and long-term stable against microbial degradation. Diluted, on the other hand, they are fast and completely biodegradable. As alkali metal formates as drilling aids make it unnecessary to add solid fillers to increase the density (such as barytes) and the formate solutions can be recovered and recycled at the drilling site, formates represent an important advance in exploration technology.William Benton and Jim Turner, Cabot Specialty Fluids: Cesium formate fluid succeeds in North Sea HPHT field trials (PDF; 88 kB); In: Drilling Contractor, Mai/Juni 2000.

History Construction on the tied-arch bridge began in 1975, and was scheduled to be completed by 1981. Construction was not completed on time due to the Ohio Department of Transportation's delays on Ohio State Route 7 along the western shores of the river. The estimated cost to construct the span was about $54 million. During construction of the span it was dubbed the \\"bridge to nowhere\\" as the bridge did not connect to the Ohio segment of I-470. In 1981, frays in the vertical hanger cables delayed the opening of the bridge, which was scheduled to open in July 1981. The opening of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge, along with another bridge in nearby Moundsville was thought to have reduced the amount of traffic, and thus tolls collected by the nearby Bellaire Bridge by up to 50 percent in 1987.

Osborne's home was once an attraction for thousands of drive-by visitors each Christmas season, with cars surrounding the estate and clogging the adjoining Cantrell Road (Highway 10) and nearby interstate. All passers by came to witness the estate covered in an elaborate display of as many as two million red lights each year. Complaints from various neighbors eventually led to intervention by the Arkansas Supreme Court, which ordered an end to the display after the 1995 Christmas season.

Singh was an alumnus of King George's Royal Indian Military College and the National Defence Academy. He was the first NDA alumnus and is the only UN Peacekeeper to be awarded a Param Vir Chakra (PVC), India's highest wartime military decoration. In December 1961, Salaria was among the Indian troops deployed to the Republic of the Congo as part of the United Nations Operation in the Congo. On 5 December, Salaria's battalion was tasked to clear a roadblock of two armoured cars manned by 150 gendarmes of the secessionist State of Katanga on the way to the Elizabethville Airport. The plan was that Salaria and his men were to block their retreat. His rocket launcher team attacked and destroyed the Katangese armoured cars. This unforeseen move confused the gendarmerie, and Salaria felt it would be best to attack before they reorganised. Though his troops were badly outnumbered, they charged towards the Katangese and killed 40 men in a kukri assault. During the attack, Salaria was shot twice in the neck and eventually succumbed to his injuries. The remaining gendarmes fled in utter confusion leaving their dead and wounded behind. This helped the main battalion to easily overrun the Katangese and clear the roadblock. For his duty and courage, and disregard for his own safety during the battle, Salaria was awarded the PVC. Early life and education Gurbachan Singh Salaria was born on 29 November 1935, in Jamwal, a village near Shakargarh, Punjab, British India (now in Pakistan). He was the second of five children of Munshi Ram and Dhan Devi. His father had earlier been drafted into the Dogra Squadron of the Hodson's Horse in the British Indian Army. He was a member of the Saini caste and an adherent to Sikhism. Listening to tales of his father and his regiment motivated Salaria to join the army at a very young age. As a result of the partition of India, Salaria's family moved to the Indian part of Punjab and settled in Jangal village in Gurdaspur district. Salaria enrolled in the local village school. He was not very attentive to his studies and spent much of his time playing kabaddi. In July 1946 he applied for admission into the King George's Royal Indian Military College in Bangalore. Though he passed the entrance exam, he failed the medical exam because his chest was too small. Salaria spent the following weeks exercising and when he applied again in August he met the requirements and was admitted into the college. In August 1947, he was transferred to the KGRIMC in Jalandhar. After passing out from KGRIMC, he joined the Joint Services Wing of the National Defence Academy (NDA). On graduating from the NDA in 1956, he enrolled in the Indian Military Academy, completing his studies on 9 June 1957. Salaria was initially commissioned into the 2nd battalion, 3 Gorkha Rifles, but was later transferred to the 3rd battalion, 1 Gorkha Rifles in March 1960. Congo Crisis In June 1960, the Republic of the Congo became independent from Belgium. But during the first week of July, a mutiny broke out in the Congolese Army and violence erupted between black and white civilians. Belgium sent troops to protect fleeing whites and two areas of the country, Katanga and South Kasai, subsequently seceded with Belgian support. The Congolese government asked the United Nations (UN) for help, and on 14 July 1960, the organisation responded by establishing the United Nations Operation in the Congo, a large multi-national peacekeeping force and aid mission. Between March‚ÄìJune 1961, under the command of Brigadier K. A. S. Raja, India contributed the 99th Infantry Brigade, around 3,000 men, to the UN force. After attempts at reconciliation between the Congolese government and Katanga failed, on 24 November, the UN Security Council approved UN Security Council Resolution 169. The resolution condemned Katanga's secession and authorised the use of force to immediately resolve the conflict and establish peace in the region. In response, the Katangese Gendarmerie took two senior UN officials hostage. They were later released, but Major Ajit Singh of the 1 Gorkha Rifles was also captured and eventually killed, as was his driver. Roadblocks were erected by the gendarmes to prevent communication between the UN detachments and isolating them from each other, making it easier to take down the detachments one by one. On 4 December a block was established on the road between the city of √âlisabethville and the nearby airport. UN troops reacted by initiating Operation Unokat to defend their positions and reestablish their freedom of movement in the region. =Operation Unokat= On 5 December 1961, the 3rd battalion, 1 Gorkha Rifles was tasked to clear the roadblock on the way to √âlizabethville Airport at a strategic roundabout. The roadblock was held by 150 gendarmes with two armoured cars. The plan was for the first attack to be made by Charlie Company, led by Major Govind Sharma. Captain Salaria, with a platoon from Alpha Company close to the airport road, was to block the gendarmes' retreat, and to attack them if required. The rest of Alpha Company was kept in reserve. The plan was to be executed at midday. Captain Salaria and his troops reached the specified location with their armoured personnel carriers. They were positioned around from the Katangese roadblock. His rocket launcher team was soon able to get close enough to the gendarmes' armoured cars to destroy them. This unforeseen move left the Katangese confused and disorganised. Salaria felt that it was prudent to attack before the gendarmes reorganised. His last words over the radio to another officer were, \\"I am going in for attack. I am certain I will win.\\" Though his troops were heavily outnumbered by the gendarmes, he charged towards them, engaging in a hand-to-hand kukri assault whilst shouting the Gorkha war cry, \\"Ayo Gorkhali\\" (). Salaria and his men killed 40 gendarmes, but he was shot twice in the neck by automatic gunfire. He collapsed due to blood loss at the last line of trenches. His second-in- command was ordered to evacuate him in an armoured personnel carrier to the airport hospital as soon as possible. Regardless, Salaria succumbed to his injuries. The close engagement with the Indian troops resulted in the gendarmerie losing about half their men; they fled in utter confusion leaving their dead and the injured behind. This enabled the main battalion to easily overrun the Katangese force, clear the roadblock, and prevent the gendarmes from encircling the UN Headquarters in √âlisabethville. For his duty and courage, and disregard for his own safety, Salaria was awarded the Param Vir Chakra. =Param Vir Chakra= For his gallant actions on 5 December 1961, Captain Gurbachan Singh Salaria was awarded the Param Vir Chakra. The citation read: Salaria was the first graduate of NDA to win a PVC, and also the only UN Peacekeeper to be awarded a PVC.

It enrolls approximately 250 students and consists of grades Pre-kindergarten through Twelfth grade. The school is co-located with Cedar Valley Bible Church on Cottage Grove Ave just east of Indian Creek. CVCS states that their purpose is to assist parents with their biblical responsibility to raise their children in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. It is the school's goal to provide academic excellence where fundamental subjects are taught from a biblical viewpoint. History CVCS was founded in 1974 under the direction of the elders of Cedar Valley Bible Church for use as a ministry of the church for students who attended or had parents who attended the church. The school started with only 34 students enrolled but has greatly expanded since. In 1978, a new wing was added and in 1987, a new gymnasium and set of classrooms was constructed. By 1993, the school included grades prekindergarten through 12th grade. As of 2015, with the financial support and participation of the church, Cedar Valley Christian School's student population has grown to about 210. CVCS has been state accredited after a rigorous self-study in 2014. Academics CVCS offers education from Pre-Kindergarten through twelfth grade. There is much overlap between the junior high and high school, and teachers often teach more than one subject. For example, the junior high math teacher also teaches junior high science and high school algebra. The upper-level math teacher also teaches auto-mechanics. AP classes available at Cedar Valley are available in literature and world history. The school requires 44 credits to graduate from high school. A class that meets every day for one hour for the entire semester earns one credit. Therefore, a student must take an average of 5.5 hours/semester to graduate. Physical education is required unless a student obtains an academic or athletic waiver. These are obtained by either taking a requisite amount of credit hours (usually six or more) or by playing in a sport for that semester. Extracurricular activities In athletics, the Huskies play against in-town teams in elementary and junior high school, sometimes traveling as far as North Liberty and Atkins. CVCS offers fifth and sixth grade volleyball, soccer, and boys and girls basketball. Junior high offers volleyball, wrestling, soccer, and basketball. The High School participates in the Iowa High School Athletic Association. The Huskies participate in the Tri-Rivers Conference in the following sports: volleyball, cheerleading (both competition and basketball), football, boys and girls soccer, boys and girls basketball and baseball. Athletes may also participate in bowling, cross country, tennis, and track & field with one of the three public high schools in Cedar Rapids. CVCS offers extracurricular activities outside of athletics including drama and choir. Facilities In 2008, a new addition was completed adding several classrooms. A new science lab, as well as various other classrooms and teacher prep space was added. Phase two of the project involves a new gym to be built on the north side of the property. Administration The school is administrated by a principal, an assistant principal, and a school board. Authority over the school is maintained by the elders of Cedar Valley Bible Church.

The original light-blue cantilever Ironton-Russell Bridge, opened in 1922 and closed in 2016, carried two lanes of traffic and a narrow sidewalk. The new white cable-stayed bridge, which has two lanes of traffic without a dedicated sidewalk and officially named the Oakley C. Collins Memorial Bridge, opened on November 23, 2016. History In 2000, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) released a report recommending the replacement of the then 78-year-old original span. The bridge was retrofitted in the 1970s with strengthening beams and plates. Later inspection of the bridge revealed that these plates had been welded to the bridge using techniques that violated the bridge welding codes and reduced the fatigue strength of primary load members. As a result of these findings, ODOT added reinforcements to some vertical members to improve structural redundancy. The original span was still forced to close when temperatures approach -5 degrees Fahrenheit due to the brittle nature of the steel used. Continuous monitoring was routine during temperatures below freezing to check for any cracking in the substructure of the span. In addition, in May 2008, ODOT placed a width restriction on the bridge, banning all vehicles wider than 7 ft. 6 in. Emergency vehicles, non- commercial vehicles and non-profit buses (such as school buses) were exempt from the restriction. ODOT authorized both the Ironton and Russell city police, along with the Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Kentucky State Police, to enforce the restriction. Also, depending on the agency issuing the citation, volators were cited in either Ironton Municipal Court in Ohio or Greenup County District Court (20th Judicial District) in Kentucky. One of the replacements considered was a three-lane single-tower cable suspension bridge. The final design was chosen in January 2003, however, the high costs of constructing the bridge became apparent when costs for the new bridge came in at $110 million, well over the original estimated cost. The sharp rise was attributed to the dramatic increase in construction costs partially blamed on Hurricane Katrina, which increased the cost of concrete materials and items derived from petroleum products. The bridge was redesigned as a two tower cable-stayed bridge, was reduced from three lanes to two and does not have a dedicated pedestrian walkway. Construction on the replacement span began in March 2012. Unlike the original bridge, which connects downtown Ironton with downtown Russell, the new bridge connects downtown Ironton directly with U.S. 23 and KY 244 within the city limits of Russell just south of downtown. The new bridge opened on November 23, 2016 with a ceremony and parade through Ironton and Russell that included crossing both the new and original structures. As part of the ceremony, the new bridge was officially named for the late Oakley C. Collins, who represented Lawrence County in both the Ohio House of Representatives and the Ohio Senate. The original bridge remained open during construction and was permanently closed at the completion of the dedication ceremony and parade. Demolition of the original structure began in December 2016 and was completed in June 2017.

Technol. Biotechnol. 1911, 30, 85. In this way about 165,000 tons were produced in 2005. The standard redox potential of sodium persulfate into hydrogen sulfate is 2.1 V, which is higher than that of hydrogen peroxide (1.8 V) but lower than ozone (2.2 V).Block, Philip A., Richard A. Brown, and David Robinson. \\"Novel activation technologies for sodium persulfate in-situ chemical oxidation.\\" Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on the remediation of chlorinated and recalcitrant compounds. 2004. The sulfate radical formed in situ has a standard electrode potential of 2.7 V. However, there are a few drawbacks in utilizing platinum anodes to produce the salts; the manufacturing process is inefficient due to oxygen evolution and the product could contain contaminants coming from platinum corrosion (mainly due to extremely oxidizing nature of the sulfate radical). Thus, boron-doped diamond electrodes have been proposed as alternatives to the conventional platinum electrodes. Applications It is mainly used as a radical initiator for emulsion polymerization reactions for styrene based polymers such as Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. Also applicable for accelerated curing of low formaldehyde adhesives. =Other uses= It is a bleach, both standalone (particularly in hair cosmetics) and as a detergent component. It is a replacement for ammonium persulfate in etching mixtures for zinc and printed circuit boards, and is used for pickling of copper and some other metals. It is also used as a soil conditioner and for soil and groundwater remediation and in manufacture of dyestuffs, modification of starch, bleach activator, desizing agent for oxidative desizing, etc. =Organic chemistry= Sodium persulfate is a specialized oxidizing agent in chemistry, classically in the Elbs persulfate oxidation and the Boyland‚ÄìSims oxidation reactions. It is also used in radical reactions; for example in a synthesis of diapocynin from apocynin where iron(II) sulfate is the radical initiator. :Diapocynin Synthesis Safety The salt is an oxidizer and forms combustible mixtures with organic materials such as paper.

Germany Year Zero takes place in Allied-occupied Germany, unlike the others, which take place in German-occupied Rome and during the Allied invasion of Italy, respectively. As in many neorealist films, Rossellini used mainly local, non-professional actors. He filmed on locations in Berlin and intended to convey the reality in Germany the year after its near total destruction in World War II. It contains dramatic images of bombed out Berlin and of the human struggle for survival following the destruction of Nazi Germany. When explaining his ideas about realism in an interview, he said, \\"realism is nothing other than the artistic form of truth.\\" Plot Twelve-year-old Edmund K√∂hler lives in devastated, Allied-occupied Berlin with his ailing, bedridden father and his adult siblings, Eva and Karl-Heinz. Eva manages to obtain cigarettes by going out with soldiers of the Allied forces, but she resists her friends' advice to prostitute herself. Karl-Heinz is the older son who fought in the war and is a burden to the struggling family, refusing to register with the police and get a ration card because he is afraid of what would happen if they found out he fought to the bitter end. The K√∂hlers and others have been assigned to the apartment home of the Rademachers by the housing authority, much to Mr. Rademacher's irritation. Edmund does what he can for his family, trying to find work and selling a scale for Mr. Rademacher on the black market. By chance, Edmund meets Herr Henning, his former school teacher, who still remains a Nazi at heart. Henning, who exhibits what may be interpreted as a pedophilic interest in Edmund, gives him a recording of Hitler to sell to the occupying soldiers, entrusting him to the more experienced Jo and Christl. Henning gives Edmund 10 marks for his work. Afterward, Edmund tags along as the young man Jo steals 40 marks from a woman by pretending to sell her a bar of soap. Jo gives Edmund some of his stolen potatoes and leaves the inexperienced boy with Christl, whom another member of their gang describes as a mattress that dispenses cigarettes. After Mr. K√∂hler takes a turn for the worse, Henning tells Edmund that life is cruel and that the weak should be sacrificed so that the strong can survive. A kindly doctor manages to get Mr. K√∂hler admitted to a hospital, where he receives much more plentiful and healthy food. This temporarily relieves some of the pressure on his family. When Edmund goes to see his father, the old man bemoans his misery. He tells his son that he has considered suicide but lacks the courage to carry it out. He says that he is a burden and that it would be better if he were dead. Edmund steals some poison while no one is looking. A few days later, the father is discharged and returns home. Edmund poisons his tea just before police raid the apartment and Karl-Heinz finally turns himself in. The father dies while his elder son is in custody. Everyone assumes the death is due to malnutrition and sickness. When Karl-Heinz returns, he is crushed by the news. A disturbed Edmund wanders the city. He turns first to Christl, but she is busy with young men and has no time for or interest in a youngster. He goes to Henning and confesses that he did as the schoolteacher had suggested, murdering his father, but Henning protests that he never told the boy to kill anyone. When Edmund tries to join younger children in a street game of football, they reject him. He ascends the ruins of a bombed out building, and watches from a hole in the wall as they take his father's coffin away across the street. Finally, after hearing his sister call for him, he jumps from the building to his death. Cast * Edmund Moeschke as Edmund K√∂hler (as Edmund Meschke) * Ernst Pittschau as Mr. K√∂hler * Ingetraud Hinze as Eva K√∂hler (as Ingetraud Hinz) * Franz-Otto Kr√ºger as Karl-Heinz K√∂hler (as Franz Gr√ºger) * Erich G√ºhne as Herr Henning, the (former) teacher Production =Pre- production= Rossellini visited Berlin in March 1947 with a vague idea of making this film.Gallagher, Tag. The Adventures of Roberto Rossellini. New York: Da Capo Press. 1998. . p. 230. Rossellini then returned to Rome and secured funding for the film from the French company Union G√©n√©rale Cin√©matographique and his friends Salvo D'Angelo and Alfredo Guarini. He also got equipment and crew members from the German company Sadfi.Gallagher. p. 235. Rossellini then returned to Berlin in July 1947 to continue research for the film and select a suitable cast.Gallagher. p. 237. During that time director Billy Wilder was in Berlin shooting A Foreign Affair, and Wilder even satirized Rossellini's film with a character that resembles Edmund. Wilder later said he regretted satirizing Rossellini in his own film, when he had tried to emulate and copy his style.Gallagher =Casting= As was his usual custom, Rossellini cast the film with non-professionals that he met on the street. Rossellini found Ernst Pittschau sitting on the front steps of a retirement home and discovered that he had been a silent film actor forty years earlier. He saw former ballet dancer Ingetraud Hinze standing in a food line and was struck with the look of despair on her face. Franz-Otto Kr√ºger came from a family of academics and had been imprisoned by the Gestapo during the war. Other smaller parts were cast with such people as a former Wehrmacht general, an ex-wrestler, a literature and art history professor, a model and a group of children that were bored of living on the streets.Gallagher. p. 240. For the lead role of Edmund, Rossellini wanted to find a young German boy who physically resembled his recently deceased son Romano Rossellini. After auditioning several young boys, Rossellini went to a performance of the Barlay circus one night to see the elephants. There he saw an eleven-year-old acrobat named Edmund Meschke and immediately asked Meschke to audition for him. Rossellini combed Meschke's hair to resemble his son and, amazed at the physical resemblance, immediately cast him in the lead role.Gallagher. p. 242. The finished film began with the title \\"This film is dedicated to the memory of my son Romano. ‚Äî Roberto Rossellini\\"Gallagher. p. 246. =Filming= Shooting began on 15 August 1947 with no formal script and Rossellini instructing the actors to improvise their dialogue. Rossellini directed the film in French and had to depend on Max Colpet to translate for him throughout shooting. While filming on location in the streets of Berlin, Rossellini was amazed by the indifference to a film crew from people on the streets who were far too preoccupied with attempting to get food and survive.Gallagher. p. 241. When Rossellini went to Rome for a week in the middle of shooting to spend time with his then mistress Anna Magnani, Carlo Lizzani directed some scenes in his absence. In mid-September location shooting in Berlin wrapped after 40 days and the production moved to Rome on 26 September 1947 to film the interior scenes.Gallagher. p. 243. When the German actors arrived in Rome they had to wait until November to resume filming because the film's sets had not been built. By November the previously malnourished Germans had gained a noticeable amount of weight while in Rome and had to be put on crash diets so as to retain continuity with their earlier scenes. After filming in Rome was complete most of the German actors didn't want to go back to Berlin and a few ran away to the Italian countryside. The film's final budget was $115,000.Gallagher. p. 244. Reception This film was in many ways vastly different from Rossellini's previous neorealism films, in that it was mostly shot in a studio and used rear screen projections for the Berlin scenes. Many critics who had previously championed Rossellini condemned the film for being melodramatic and disappointingly unrealistic. Rossellini stated that he wanted to \\"tell a story of a child, of an innocent creature which a distorted 'utopian' education induced to commit murder in the belief that he was performing a heroic gesture. But a feeble light of morality is not yet extinguished in him; driven by those small gleams of conscious, confused, he commits suicide.\\"Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 2. H. W. Wilson Company. 1987. p. 962. Jean Georges Auriol called it hasty and superficial. Andre Bazin called it \\"not a movie but a sketch, a rough draft of a work Rossellini hasn't given us.\\"Gallagher. p. 288. However, L'√âcran fran√ßais called it revolutionary, and Charlie Chaplin said it was \\"the most beautiful Italian film\\" he had ever seen.Gallagher. p. 251. Rossellini said that \\"I don't think it's possible to say more bad things about a film than were said about Germany Year Zero.\\"Gallagher. p. 266. Most Germans disliked the film's negative and pessimistic attitude. The film was first screened in Germany in 1952 at a brief Munich film club screening and was not seen again until it was shown on German TV in 1978. In 1949 Austrian film critic Hans Habe called it \\"a terrifying film...not artistically, but because it would be terrifying if the world saw the new Germany as Rossellini does.\\"Gallagher. p. 245. It premiered in New York in September 1949 and was negatively compared to Bicycle Thieves.Gallagher. p. 295. Bosley Crowther said that the film had \\"a strange emptiness of genuine feeling.\\"Gallagher. p. 336. It went on to win the Golden Leopard and the Best Director award at the Locarno International Film Festival. References Further reading * Serceau, Michel. Roberto Rossellini.

Key to this process is that players evaluate and re-evaluate the trick-taking potential of their hands as the auction proceeds and additional information about partner's hand and the opponent's hands becomes available. Hand evaluation methods assess various features of a hand, including: its high card strength, shape or suit , , fit with partner, quality of suits and quality of the whole hand. The methods range from basic to complex, requiring partners to have the same understandings and agreements about their application in their bidding system. Basic point-count system Most bidding systems use a basic point-count system for hand evaluation using a combination of high card points and distributional points, as follows. =High card points= First published in 1915 by Bryant McCampbell in Auction Tactics (page 26), the 4-3-2-1 count for honours was not established by computer analysis (as is sometimes rumoured) but was derived from the game Auction Pitch. Although 'Robertson's Rule' for bidding (the 7-5-3 count) had been in use for more than a dozen years, McCampbell sought a more \\"simple scale of relative values. The Pitch Scale is the easiest to remember. (Those ... who have played Auction Pitch will have no difficulty in recognizing and remembering these values.)\\" Called the Milton Work Point Count when popularized by him in the early Thirties and then the Goren Point Count when re-popularized by Work's disciple Charles Goren in the Fifties,Francis et al, 2001, page 355: POINT-COUNT. and now known simply as the high-card point (HCP) count, this basic evaluation method assigns numeric values to the top four honour cards as follows: * ace = 4 HCP * king = 3 HCP * queen = 2 HCP * jack = 1 HCP Evaluating a hand on this basis takes due account of the fact that there are 10 HCP in each suit and therefore 40 in the complete deck of cards. An average hand contains one quarter of the total, i.e. 10 HCP. The method has the dual benefits of simplicity and practicality, especially in notrump contracts. Most bidding systems are based upon the premise that a better than average hand is required to open the bidding; 12 HCP is generally considered the minimum for most opening bids. Limitations The combined HCP count between two balanced hands is generally considered to be a good indication, all else being equal, of the number of tricks likely to be made by the partnership. The rule of thumb for games and slams in notrump is as follows:Root, 1998Klinger, 1994 * 25 HCP are necessary for game, i.e. 3 NT * 33 HCP are necessary for a small slam, i.e. 6 NT * 37 HCP are necessary for a grand slam, i.e. 7 NT A simple justification for 37 HCP being suitable for a grand slam is that it is the lowest number that guarantees the partnership holding all the aces. Similarly 33 HCP is the lowest number that guarantees at least three aces. Although mostly effective for evaluating the combined trick- taking potential of two balanced hands played in notrump, even in this area of applicability the HCP is not infallible. Jeff Rubens gives the following example:Rubens, 1971, pages 7‚Äì8. Both East hands are exactly the same, and both West hands have the same shape, the same HCP count, and the same high cards. The only difference between the West hands is that two low red cards and one low black card have been swapped (between the heart suit and the diamond suit, and between the spade suit and the club suit, respectively). With a total of 34 HCP in the combined hands, based on the above-mentioned HCP-requirement for slam, most partnerships would end in a small slam (12 tricks) contract. Yet, the left layout produces 13 tricks in notrump, whilst the right layout on a diamond lead would fail to produce more than 10 tricks in notrump. In this case, the difference in trick-taking potential is due to duplication in the high card values: in the bottom layout the combined 20 HCP in spades and diamonds results in only five tricks. Because such duplication can often not be detected during bidding, the high card point method of hand evaluation, when used alone, provides only a preliminary estimate of the trick-taking potential of the combined hands and must be supplemented by other means for improved accuracy, particularly for unbalanced hands. Accordingly, expert players use HCP as a starting point in the evaluation of their hands, and make adjustments based on: * refinements to the HCP valuation for certain holdings, * the use of additional point values for hand shape or distribution (known as distribution points), and * bidding techniques to determine the specifics of any control cards held by partner. Collectively, these more effectively evaluate the combined holdings of a partnership. Refinements ;For aces and tens The 4-3-2-1 high card point evaluation has been found to statistically undervalue aces and tens and alternatives have been devised to increase a hand's HCP value. To adjust for aces, Goren recommendedGoren, 1954, page 11. deducting one HCP for an aceless hand and adding one for holding four aces. Some adjust for tens by adding 1/2 HCP for each. Alternatively, some treat aces and tens as a group and add one HCP if the hand contains three or more aces and tens; Richard Pavlicek advocates adding one HCP if holding four or more aces and tens.Richard Pavlicek website retrieved August 11, 2011. ;For unguarded honours Goren and othersDowney and Pomer, 2005, page 27. recommend deducting one HCP for a singleton king, queen, or jack. ;Alternative scale Marty Bergen claimsBergen, 2002, page 8. Bergen does not cite the source of the computer analysis. that with the help of computers, bridge theorists have devised a more accurate valuation of the honors as follows: * ace = 4.5 HCP * king = 3 HCP * queen = 1.5 HCP * jack = 0.75 HCP * ten = 0.25 Note that this scale keeps the 40 high card point system intact. The scale may seem cumbersome, but if one considers the ace and ten honors \\"hard\\" and the queen and jack honors \\"soft\\" it is much easier to accurately count high card points by using the familiar 4-3-2-1 system and then adjusting. One can see that the ace and queen have something in common in that they are both \\"off\\" by a half point. The jack and ten are also both \\"off\\" by a quarter point. So for example, a hand with one of each honor (A, K, Q, J, 10) would be counted as 10 HCP. Since the hard and soft values are equal (the ace and queen cancel out, and the jack and ten cancel out), there is no adjustment. On the other hand, to take an extreme example, a hand with four aces and four tens (no kings, queens, or jacks) would be counted at 16 HCP at first, but since it holds eight hard values and no soft values, it is adjusted to 19 HCP. Bergen's ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù scale appears to be identical to the ‚Äúhigh card value of the Four Aces System‚Äù found on the front inside cover and on page 5 of the 1935 book, The Four Aces System of Contract BridgeJacoby, 1935, page 5. by (alphabetically) David Burnstine, Michael T. Gottlieb, Oswald Jacoby and Howard Schenken. The Four Aces' book (Jacoby may have written most or all of it) gives the simpler 3-2-1- version of the progression. Dividing Bergen's numbers by 1.5 produces exactly the same numbers published by the Four Aces seven decades earlier: * Bergen ace = 4.5 √∑ 1.5 = 3 Four Aces Count * Bergen king = 3.0 √∑ 1.5 = 2 Four Aces Count * Bergen queen = 1.5 √∑ 1.5 = 1 Four Aces Count * Bergen jack = .75 √∑ 1.5 = ¬Ω Four Aces Count ‚Äî Q.E.D. =Distributional points= In order to improve the accuracy of the bidding process, the high card point count is supplemented by the evaluation of unbalanced or shapely hands using additional simple arithmetic methods. Two approaches are common ‚Äì evaluation of suit length and evaluation of suit shortness. Suit length points At its simplest it is considered that long suits have a value beyond the HCP held: this can be turned into numbersEnglish Bridge Union, 1998. on the following scale: * 5-card suit = 1 point * 6 card suit = 2 points * 7 card suit = 3 points ... etc. A hand comprising a 5-card suit and a 6-card suit gains points for both, i.e., 1 + 2 making 3 points in total. Other combinations are dealt with in a similar way. These distribution points (sometimes called length points) are added to the HCP to give the total point value of the hand. Confusion can arise because the term \\"points\\" can be used to mean either HCP, or HCP plus length points. This method, of valuing both honour cards and long suits, is suitable for use at the opening bid stage before a trump suit has been agreed. In the USA this method of combining HCP and long-card points is known as the point-count system. Suit shortness points Once a trump suit has been agreed, or at least a partial fit has been uncovered, it is argued by many that ruffing potential as represented by short suits becomes more significant than long suits. Accordingly, in a method devised by William AndersonCanadian Bridge Federation, Bridge Canada, April 2012, page 18 of Toronto and popularized by Charles Goren,Francis et al, 2001, page 120: Distributional Count. distribution points are added for shortage rather than length. When the supporting hand holds three trumps, shortness is valuedDowney and Pomer, 2005, page 35. as follows: * void = 3 points * singleton = 2 points * doubleton = 1 point When the supporting hand holds four or more trumps, thereby having more spare trumps for ruffing, shortness is valued as follows: * void = 5 points * singleton = 3 points * doubleton = 1 point Shortage points (also known as support points or dummy points) are added to HCP to give total points.  Combination Count  This methodFrancis et al, 1994, page 111: DISTRIBUTIONAL COUNTS. uses both lengths and shortages in all situations. The hand scores two shortage points for a void and one for a singleton, and this total is added to the usual length count: one point is added for each card in a suit beyond four. An alternative approach is to create a distributional point count of a hand to be added to HCP simply by adding the combined length of the two longest suits, subtracting the length of the shortest suit, and subtracting a further five. On this basis 4333 hands score -1 and all other shapes score a positive distributional count. =Summary= When intending to make a bid in a suit and there is no agreed upon trump suit, add high card points and length points to get the total point value of one's hand. When intending to raise an agreed trump suit, add high card points and shortness points. When making a bid in notrump with intent to play, value high-card points only. Supplementary methods The basic point-count system does not solve all evaluation problems and in certain circumstances is supplemented by refinements to the HCP count or by additional methods. =Control count= The control count is a supplementary method that is mainly used in combination with HCP count to determine the trick-taking potential of fitting hands, in particular to investigate slam potential. The use of control count addresses the fact that for suit contracts, aces and kings tend to be undervalued in the standard 4‚Äì3‚Äì2‚Äì1 HCP scale; aces and kings allow declarer better control over the hands and can prevent the opponents from retaining or gaining the lead. The control count is the sum of the controls where aces are valued as two controls, kings as one control and queens and jacks as zero. This control count can be used as \\"tie-breakers\\" for hands evaluated as marginal by their HCP count. Hands with the same shape and the same HCP can have markedly different slam potential depending on the control count. In the above examples, both West hands are the same, and both East hands have the same shape and HCP (16). Yet, the layout above represents a solid slam (12 tricks) in spades, whilst the layout below will fail to produce 12 tricks. The difference between the East hands becomes apparent when conducting a control count: in the top layout East has two aces and two kings for a total of six controls, whilst in the bottom layout has one ace and two kings for a total of four controls. {class=wikitable style=\\"float:left; margin-right:1.0em\\" !width=\\"50%\\"HCPExpected Controls - align=center 51 - align=center 7‚Äì82 - align=center 103 - align=center 12‚Äì134 - align=center 155 - align=center 17‚Äì186 - align=center 207 } The interpretation of the significance of the control count is based upon a publication by George Rosenkranz in the December 1974 issue of The Bridge World.Francis et al, 2001, page 144: EXPECTED NUMBER OF CONTROLS IN BALANCED HANDS. Rosenkranz defined \\"the expected number of controls in balanced hands\\" at specific HCP counts as 'control-neutral' in a table similar to the consolidation shown on the left; having more controls is deemed 'control-rich' and having less is 'control-weak'. The table can be used as tie-breaker for estimating the slam-going potential of hands like the above two East hands. Whilst the top East hand counts 16 HCP, in terms of controls (6) it is equivalent to a hand typically 1‚Äì2 HCP stronger, whereas the bottom East hand, also counting 16 HCP, is in terms of controls (4) more equivalent to 12‚Äì13 HCP. If West opens the bidding with 1, both East hands should aim for at least game (4), the partnership having the minimum 26 total points typically required for a game contract in the majors. Despite the spade suit fit, both East hands have marginal slam potential based on their 16 HCP count alone. On the top layout the control-rich East (an upgraded 17‚Äì18 HCP) should explore slam and be willing to bypass 4 in doing so, whilst on the bottom layout the control-weak East (a downgraded 12‚Äì13 HCP) should be more cautious and be prepared to stop in 4 should further bidding reveal West lacking a control in diamonds. Having determined the degree of interest in exploring slam possibilities, the methods and conventions to determine which controls (aces, kings and even queens) are held by the partnership include: the Blackwood convention, the Norman four notrump convention, the Roman Key Card Blackwood convention and cuebids. In his book \\"The Modern Losing Trick Count\\", Ron Klinger advocates the use of the control count to make adjustments to the LTC hand evaluation method (see below). =Negative/positive features= Certain combinations of cards have higher or lower trick taking potential than the simple point count methods would suggest. Proponents of this idea suggest that HCP should be deducted from hands where negative combinations occur. Similarly, additional points might be added where positive combinations occur. This method is particularly useful in making difficult decisions on marginal hands, especially for overcalling and in competitive bidding situations. In lieu of arithmetic addition or subtraction of HCP or distributional points, 'plus' or 'minus' valuations may be applied to influence the decision. Negative features worth less than the HCP suggest: *Honour doubletons K-Q, Q-J. Q-x, J-x unless in partners suit. Although Samuel Stayman recommended deducting one HCP for K-Q, K-J, Q-J,Q-x,J-x Q-x-x, J-x-x holdings, this is now considered extreme. *Honour singletons; some exempt the singleton ace but others consider it inflexible in play. *Honour combinations not accompanied by a small card. *Honours in opponents' suit when deciding to support partner's suit. *Honours in side suits when deciding to overcall. *The club suit when opening because it allows opponents to overcall more easily. *The next suit above RHO's suit when overcalling (unless a very good suit) which gives opponents information but does not cut into their bidding space. *Honours in suits shown by LHO. Positive features worth more than the HCP suggest: *Honours in long suits. *Two or three honours in long suits (better). *Honour sequences in long suits (best). *Honours in partner's suit when deciding to support it. *Honours in own suit when deciding to overcall. *Two or three intermediate cards in a suit (8, 9 10) especially if headed by honours. *The spade suit when opening ... makes overcalling more difficult. *The next suit below RHO's suit when overcalling reduces the opponents' bidding space. *Honours in suits shown by RHO. =Defensive/attacking values= Certain combinations of cards are better in defence and others are more valuable in attack (i.e. as declarer). There is some overlap with the concept of negative and positive points. Defensive values that suggest a hand should defend: *Honours in shortish side suits, e.g. Kxx. *Honours and/or length in opponents suit. *Lack of honours in own suit. Attacking values that suggest a hand should play a contract as declarer or dummy: *Honours in own suit (the more the better). *Lack of defensive values. This concept is sometimes stated as the \\"Offence-Defence Ratio\\" (ODR) of a hand. For example, a suit KQJ10987 will take 6 tricks with this as the trump suit but maybe none in defence; it has a high ODR. If the same cards are randomly scattered through different suits, they are about equally likely to take tricks in attack or defence. Point count or the Losing Trick Count indicate how many tricks a hand is likely to make in offence; a hand with high ODR will tend to be more distributional, with lower HCP, and take less tricks in defence than a hand with the same number of losers but a low ODR. There is no precise numerical statement of the ODR. Methods to help with opening bids and overcalls on marginal hands =Rule of 22= Add together the number of HCP in the hand, and the number of cards in the two longest suits, and the number of quick tricks in the hand. If the resultant number is 22 or higher, then an opening bid is suggested [the choice of which bid depends on partnership agreement]. In 3rd seat the requirement may be lowered to 19. Quick tricks are: AK=2, AQ=1.5, A=1, KQ=1, Kx[x]=0.5 [singleton K=0]. This formula for evaluating opening bid strength is referred to by Ron Klinger as \\"Highly Cutie\\" [HI-LE QT]: HIgh card points + LEngth count + Quick Tricks. The method attempts to improve the widely accepted 'Rule of 20' by emphasizing the importance of defensive values in a one-level opening hand, and by assigning greater value to honor cards that work together in the same suit than to honors that are split between suits. =Rule of 20= Add together the number of HCP in the hand, and the number of cards in the two longest suits. If the resultant number is 20 or higher and most of the high cards are in the long suits,Francis et al. 2001, page 401: RULE OF TWENTY. then an opening bid is suggested (the choice of which bid requires further analysis). As an example, a hand containing 11 HCP and 5‚Äì4‚Äì2‚Äì2 shape would qualify for an opening bid because the resultant number would be 20 (11 + 5 + 4) whereas 11 HCP and 4‚Äì4‚Äì3‚Äì2 shape would not (11 + 4 + 4 = 19). This method gives very similar results to length points as above except for a hand containing 11 HCP and 5‚Äì3‚Äì3‚Äì2 shape which gives 19 on the Rule of 20 (insufficient to open) but 12 total points by adding 1 length point to the 11 HCP (sufficient to open). Experience and further analysis are needed to decide which is appropriate. =Rule of 19= Identical to the Rule of 20 but some expert players believe that 20 is too limiting a barrier and prefer 19. =Suit Quality Test (SQT)= The SQT evaluates an individual suit as a precursor to deciding whether, and at what level, certain bids should be made. This method is generally considered useful for making an overcall and for making a preemptive opening bid; it works for long suits i.e. 5 cards at least, as follows: Add together the number of cards in the suit and the number of high (honour) cards in the suit. For this purpose high cards are considered to be A, K, Q, J and 10 but the J and 10 are only to be counted if at least one of the A, K or Q are present. The resultant number determines the level at which the particular bid should be made (Klinger 1994) according to this scale: * 7 = a one level bid * 8 = a two level bid * 9 = a three level bid .... etc. An alternative way to look at this is that the bid should be to the level of the number of tricks equal to the SQT number. This method was originally proposed as a way of enabling overcalls to be made with relatively few HCP but with little risk. It can also be used to determine whether a hand is suitable for a preemptive bid. Methods to help when a fit has been discovered Paraphrasing Crowhurst and Kambites (1992), \\"Experts often sail into an unbeatable slam with only 25 HCP whereas it would never occur to most players to proceed beyond game\\". {class=wikitable style=\\"float:left; margin- right:1.0em\\" !width=\\"50%\\"NorthSouth - align=center 13 - align=center 44 - align=center ?} For example, holding with the auction shown on the left, they point out that the bidding indicates at least 6/3 in spades and 5/3 in diamonds. If partner has 3 aces (easily discovered), a grand slam (13 tricks: 6, 1, 5, 1) is likely. This grand slam can easily be bid despite the partnership holding around 29 HCP only (12 in hand above plus 17 in the hand bidding the jump shift (1 ‚Äì 3). At lower levels it is harder to be as precise but Crowhust & Kambites advise \\"With a good fit bid aggressively but with a misfit be cautious\\". Some of the methods that follow are designed to use arithmetic in the evaluation of hands that fit with partner's. =Losing-Trick Count (LTC)= Once a trump fit has been found, this alternative (to HCP) method is used in situations where shape and fit are of more significance than HCP in determining the optimum level of a suit contract. The \\"losing-tricks\\" in a hand are added to the systemically assumed losing tricks in partners hand (7 for an opening bid of 1 of a suit) and the resultant number is deducted from 24; the net figure is the number of tricks a partnership can expect to win when playing in the agreed trump suit. The basic method assumes that an ace will never be a loser, nor will a king in a 2+ card suit, nor a queen in a 3+ card suit, thus * a void = 0 losing tricks. * a singleton other than an A = 1 losing trick. * a doubleton AK = 0, Ax or KQ = 1, Kx = 1, xx = 2 losing tricks. * a three card suit AKQ = 0, AKx = , AQx = 1, KQx = 1 losing trick. * a three card suit Axx = 1, Kxx = 2, Qxx = 2, xxx = 3 losing tricks. * suits longer than three cards are judged according to the three highest cards; no suit may have more than 3 losing tricks. A typical opening hand, e.g. AKxxx Axxx Qx xx, has 7 losers (1+2+2+2=7). To calculate how high to bid, responder adds the number of losers in their hand to the assumed number in opener's hand (7). The total number of losers is subtracted from 24. The answer is the total number of tricks available to the partnership, and this should be the next bid by responder. Thus following an opening bid of 1: * partner jumps to game with no more than 7 losers in hand and a fit with partner's heart suit (3 if playing 5-card majors) ... 7 + 7 = 14 subtract from 24 = 10 tricks. * With 8 losers in hand and a fit, responder bids 3 (8+7=15 which deducted from 24 = 9 tricks). * With 9 losers and a fit, responder bids 2. * With only 5 losers and a fit, a slam is likely so responder may bid straight to 6 if preemptive bidding seems appropriate or take a slower forcing approach. =LTC refined= Thinking that the method tended to overvalue unsupported queens and undervalue supported jacks, Eric Crowhurst and Andrew Kambites refined the scale, as have others: * AQ doubleton = loser according to Ron Klinger. * Kx doubleton = 1 losers according to others. * AQJ = loser ... not one. * KQJ = 1 loser. * AJ10 = 1 loser according to Harrison-Gray. * KJ10 = 1 losers according to Bernard Magee. * QJ10 = 2 losers. * Qxx = 3 losers (or possibly 2.5) unless trumps, or unless partner has bid the suit. * Subtract a loser if there is a known 9-card trump fit. In his book The Modern Losing Trick Count, Ron Klinger advocates adjusting the number of loser based on the control count of the hand believing that the basic method undervalues an ace but overvalues a queen and undervalues short honor combinations such as Qx or a singleton king. Also it places no value on cards jack or lower. Bernard Magee also points out that the LTC can overvalue doubletons. A hand with two doubletons will usually have more immediate losers than one with a singleton and 3 cards in the other suit. The older \\"shortage points\\" method values the second hand type higher. =New Losing Trick Count (NLTC)= Main article New Losing Trick Count Extending these thoughts, most experts agree that basic LTC undervalues Aces and overvalues Queens. In addition, many believe that worthless singletons and doubletons are generally overvalued. Recent insights on these issues have led to the New Losing Trick Count (The Bridge World, May 2003). For more precision, this method utilizes the concept of half-losers and, more important, distinguishes between 'Ace-losers', 'King-losers' and 'Queen- losers.' Considering only the three highest ranking cards in each suit: * missing Ace = three half-losers (1.5 losers) * missing King = two half-losers (1.0 loser) * missing Queen = one half-loser (0.5 losers) Adopters of NLTC should note that all singletons, except singleton A, are counted as three half-losers (1.5 losers), and all doubletons that are missing both the A and K are counted as five half-losers (2.5 losers). Like basic LTC, no suit contains more than three losers, so with NLTC, three small cards in a suit are counted as six half-losers (3.0 losers). A typical opening bid is assumed to have 15 or fewer half-losers, or 7.5 losers, which is half a loser more compared to basic LTC. NLTC also differs from LTC in the fact that it utilises a value of 25 (instead of 24 with basic LTC) in determining the trick-taking potential of two partnering hands. Hence, in NLTC the expected number of tricks equates to 25 minus the sum of the losers in the two hands (i.e. half the sum of the half-losers in both hands). So, 15 half-losers opposite 15 half-losers leads to 25-(15+15)/2 = 10 tricks. Similar to basic LTC, users may employ an alternative formula to determine the appropriate contract level. The NLTC alternative formula is 19 (instead of 18 with basic LTC) minus the sum of the losers in the two hands (i.e. half the sum of the half-losers in both hands) = the suggested contract level to which the partnership should bid. So, 15 half- losers opposite 15 half-losers leads to 19-(15+15)/2 = 4-level contract. Players already familiar with this formula will recognize the difference between 25 (total projected tricks) and 19 (projected contract level) as the number of tricks required by declarer to secure a \\"book\\", which is 6. There is no evidence that this method is better than the original losing trick count. =Law of Total Tricks, Total Trumps Principle, TNT (Total Number of Trumps = Total Number of Tricks)= For shapely hands where a trump fit has been agreed, the combined length of the trump suit can be more significant than points or HCP in deciding on the level of the final contract. It is of most value in competitive bidding situations where the HCP are divided roughly equally between the partnerships. * Bridge: TNT and Competitive Bidding (1981) was probably the first major book on this topic. In the introductionPayne, 1981, page 7 the authors acknowledge Jean-Ren√© Vernes as the first writer to delve into the TNT (Total Number of Tricks) Theory. This book and these authors are little known in North America. What a shame! They touch several aspects of TNT that are rarely mentioned by others. Chapter Four on Total Distribution is worth the price (if you can locate a used copy of this out-of- print book). Page 19 carries a key table that may not be printed elsewhere. * The Law of Total Tricks states that \\"On every hand of bridge, the total number of tricks available is equal to, or very close to, the total number of cards in each side's longest suit\\". Total tricks is defined as the sum of the number of tricks available to each side if they could choose trumps. * The Total Trumps Principle is derived from the Law of Total Tricks and argues that this is more often than not a winning strategy, \\"Bid to the contract equal to the number of trumps you and your partner hold (and no higher) in a competitive auction\\". * In 2002, Anders Wirgren called the accuracy of the \\"law\\" into question, saying it works on only 40% of deals. However, Larry Cohen remains convinced it is a useful guideline, especially when adjustments are used properly. Mendelson (1998) finds that it is \\"accurate to within one trick on the vast majority of hands\\" Methods to help with strong hands Hands with relatively solid long suits have a trick taking potential not easily measured by the basic pointcount methods (e.g. a hand containing 13 spades will take all 13 tricks if spades are trumps, but will only score 19 on the point count method, 10 HCP + 9 length point). For such hands, playing tricks is deemed more suitable. Responding to such hands is best made considering quick tricks. =Quick Tricks= Quick tricks are similar to, but not the same as, Honor Tricks in the Culbertson system. They are calculated suit by suit as follows: * 2 quick tricks = AK of the same suit * 1 quick tricks = AQ in the same suit * 1 quick trick = A * 1 quick trick = KQ in the same suit * quick trick = Kx (not K singleton) This method is used when replying to very strong suit opening bids such as the Acol 2 where 1 quick tricks are needed to make a positive response (Klinger 1994). =Playing Tricks= For relatively strong hands containing long suits (e.g. an Acol 2 opener), playing tricks are defined as the number of tricks expected, with no help from partner, given that the longest suit is trumps. Thus for long suits the ace, king and queen are counted together with all cards in excess of 3 in the suit; for short suits only clear winner combinations are counted: * A = 1, AK = 2, AKQ = 3 * KQ = 1, KQJ = 2 An Acol strong 2 of a suit opening bid is made on 8 playing tricks (Landy 1998) More advanced methods =Zar Points= This statistically derived method for evaluating Contract Bridge hands was developed by Zar Petkov. It attempts to account for many of the factors outlined above in a numerical way. =Visualisation= A key differentiator between the bidding effectiveness of experts versus laymen is the use of hand visualisation during all stages of bidding. In his book The Secrets of Winning Bridge, Jeff Rubens advises to focus on just a few hands that partner might be holding, and more particularly on perfect minimum hands compatible with the bidding. This means that in order to reach an informed decision in, for example, deciding whether a hand is worth an invitation to game or slam, a player should 'visualise' the most balanced distribution with the minimum HCP partner might have with the high cards selected such that these fit precisely with your own hand. He advises that \\"your hand is worth an invitation to game (or slam) if this perfect minimum holding for partner will make it a laydown\\". Rubens gives the following example: QJ2 A32 KQJ54 A3 Partner opens 1. A minimum hand compatible with the bidding would have no more than 12 HCP, and be relatively balanced (i.e. 5332). The hand would be perfect if partner's points were solely located in spades and diamond. So a perfect minimum would be: AK543 654 A2 542 Such a perfect minimum would give a solid slam in spades whereas reliance on HCP would not indicate a slam possibility. This is the advantage of the 'visualisation' method.

Known as Eddy de Rothschild, he graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, after which he traveled the world. Returning home, he worked at the N M Rothschild & Sons bank but shortly thereafter World War II broke out and he joined the British Army. An artillery officer in the Buckinghamshire Yeomanry, he served with the British Expeditionary Force in France then fought in the North African Campaign and in Italy with the 77th Field (Highland) Regiment, then became a major in the newly formed Jewish Infantry Brigade.Obituary: Daily Telegraph In May 1946 Rothschild was demobilised and once back home in England he returned to work at N M Rothschild & Sons. He became a partner, his father having died in 1942, but then had very little experience. Tutored by his uncle Anthony Gustav de Rothschild, he played a key role in the continuing success of the bank, and became its Chairman from 1970 to 1975.Obituary: Daily Telegraph An aggressive business developer, during his career Rothschild flew the Atlantic Ocean more than four hundred times playing a key role in developing British interests in postwar Japan and was a significant part of the Rothschild syndicate that formed the British Newfoundland Development Corporation to undertake mineral exploration in Labrador, Canada and to develop the Churchill Falls hydro-electric dam. Over the years he was involved in a number of philanthropic causes and in recognition of his services, the New Year Honours 1997 made Rothschild a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Still active into his nineties, he was President of the Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen and Women (AJEX). In 1998, he appeared in the Chuck Olin documentary film titled In Our Own Hands that told the story of the only all-Jewish fighting force in World War II. Like other members of the Rothschild family, he was an art collector, but the maintenance and development of the Exbury gardens was his most important pastime. From his father, Rothschild inherited Exbury Gardens in Hampshire which had fallen into severe disrepair as a result of the War, and he set about restoring the gardens. Edmund's expertise became such that in the 1950s and 1960s he served on the Council of the Royal Horticultural Society. In 2001, the American Rhododendron Society in Eugene, Oregon awarded him a citation in appreciation of his many services to the horticultural world. In 2005, the Royal Horticultural Society bestowed on him the Victoria Medal of Honour, the highest accolade in the British gardening world.

Structure and reactions NiCO3 adopts a structure like calcite, consisting of nickel in an octahedral coordination geometry. Nickel carbonates are hydrolyzed upon contact with aqueous acids to give solutions containing the ion [Ni(H2O)6]2+, liberating water and carbon dioxide in the process. Calcining (heating to drive off CO2 and water) of these carbonates gives nickel oxide: :NiCO3 ‚Üí NiO + CO2 The nature of the resulting oxide depends on the nature of the precursor.

The film was a co-production between Italy and the United States through M.B.S. Cinematografica, G.I.A. Cinematografica and International Entertainment Corp.  Plot  An attorney arrives at a castle to settle the estate of its recently deceased owner. The owner's widow and daughter claim that the late lord could summon the souls of ancient plague victims, and that his spirit roams the castle. Soon, occupants of the castle begin to die in gruesome, violent ways when the dead lord and plague victims return to exact revenge.

Producer Ralph Zucker was an American child actor in the early 1950s. In 1958, Zucker moved to Italy to work as an editor and producer. In an issue of Video Watchdog in 1991, Alan Upchurch credited the direction of the film solely to Zucker based on an interview with Walter Brandi, who claimed that Zucker shot the film. A few years later, Lucas Balbo interviewed Pupillo who said he let Zucker be credited as the director as he \\"didn't care about the film\\", and that he did not want his name on both this film and Bloody Pit of Horror. Screenwriter Roberto Natale also confirmed Pupillo as the director. Pupillo stated that he did not get along with actress Barbara Steele on set describing her attitude as \\"really disgusting\\". On the fourth day of shooting, Pupillo said he faced her in front of the whole crew and that the two got along after this encounter. Zucker did direct a few extra scenes that were in the American cut of the film. These included the prologue scenes and the suicide of the wheelchair-bound character Stinel (Ennio Balbo). Other scenes included in the American cut involved a scene of a horse kicking a man to death. Release Terror-Creatures from the Grave was released in Italy on June 23, 1965, where it was distributed by Selecta. It grossed a total of 89 million Italian lire. The film was released on May 16, 1967 in the United States where it was distributed by Pacemaker Pictures. On the film's release abroad, Roberto Curti, author of Italian Gothic Horror Films, 1957-1969, stated that Terror- Creatures from the Grave was \\"perhaps one of the most popular Italian horror films of the decade abroad.\\" Several home video releases have many different versions of the film. The DVD from Something Weird Video has a running time of 77 minutes and 30 seconds, and includes a nude scene with Mirella Maravidi. This scene is not included in Sinister Cinema's video release, which is four minutes longer due to an extra dialogue scene. Severin Films has announced a planned Blu-ray release of the film.

Abraham and M.F. Bear to refer to the plasticity of synaptic plasticity. Until that time synaptic plasticity had referred to the plastic nature of individual synapses. However this new form referred to the plasticity of the plasticity itself, thus the term meta-plasticity. The idea is that the synapse's previous history of activity determines its current plasticity. This may play a role in some of the underlying mechanisms thought to be important in memory and learning such as long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD) and so forth. These mechanisms depend on current synaptic \\"state\\", as set by ongoing extrinsic influences such as the level of synaptic inhibition, the activity of modulatory afferents such as catecholamines, and the pool of hormones affecting the synapses under study. Recently, it has become clear that the prior history of synaptic activity is an additional variable that influences the synaptic state, and thereby the degree, of LTP or LTD produced by a given experimental protocol. In a sense, then, synaptic plasticity is governed by an activity-dependent plasticity of the synaptic state; such plasticity of synaptic plasticity has been termed metaplasticity. There is little known about metaplasticity, and there is much research currently underway on the subject, despite its difficulty of study, because of its theoretical importance in brain and cognitive science. Most research of this type is done via cultured hippocampus cells or hippocampal slices. Hebbian plasticity The brain is \\"plastic\\", meaning it can be molded and formed. This plasticity is what allows you to learn throughout your lifetime; your synapses change based on your experience. New synapses can be made, old ones destroyed, or existing ones can be strengthened or weakened. The original theory of plasticity is called \\"Hebbian plasticity\\", named after Donald Hebb in 1949. A quick but effective summary of Hebbian theory is that \\"cells that fire together, wire together\\", together being the key word here which will be explained shortly. Hebb described an early concept of the theory, not the actual mechanics themselves. Hebbian plasticity involves two mechanisms: LTP and LTD, discovered by Bliss and Lomo in 1973. LTP, or long-term potentiation, is the increase of synapse sensitivity due to a prolonged period of activity in both the presynaptic and postsynaptic neuron. This prolonged period of activity is normally concentrated electric impulses, usually around 100 Hz. It is called \\"coincidence\\" detection in that it only strengthens the synapse if there was sufficient activity in both the presynaptic and postsynaptic cells. If the postsynaptic cell does not become sufficiently depolarized then there is no coincidence detection and LTP/LTD do not occur. LTD, or long-term depression, works the same way however it focuses on a lack of depolarization coincidence. LTD can be induced by electrical impulses at around 5 Hz. These changes are synapse specific. A neuron can have many different synapses all controlled via the same mechanisms defined here. The earliest proposed mechanism for plastic activity is based around glutamate receptors and their ability to change in number and strength based on synapse activity. Glutamate binds two main receptor types: AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and NMDA receptors (NMDARs). These are named after drugs that bind to the receptors: alpha- amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D- aspartate (NMDA), respectively, but they both bind glutamate. When a glutamatergic synapse releases glutamate it binds to any AMPA and the NMDA receptors present in the postsynaptic membrane. The AMPA receptors are ionotropic receptors that are responsible for fast synaptic transmission. In a nutshell the NMDA receptors evoke a response in the cell only when sufficient glutamate has been transmitted to cause that cell to depolarize enough to unblock the NMDA receptor. Sufficient depolarization in the membrane will cause the magnesium cation blockade in the NMDA receptors to vacate, thus allowing calcium influx into the cell. NMDA receptors are \\"coincidence detectors\\". They determine when the presynaptic and postsynaptic neuron are linked in time via activity. When this occurs, NMDA receptors become the control mechanism that dictates how the AMPA and NMDA receptors are to be rearranged. The rearrangement of AMPA and NMDA receptors has become the central focus of current studies of metaplasticity as it directly determines LTP and LTD thresholds. However, some evidence indicates that G protein- coupled receptors (GPCRs) are responsible for controlling NMDA receptor activity, which suggests that NMDAR-mediated changes in synaptic strength are modulated by the activity of GPCRs. There is large amounts of research focused on finding the specific enzymes and intracellular pathways involved in the NMDAR-mediated modulation of membrane AMPA receptors. Recent biochemical research has shown that a deficiency in the protein tenascin-R (TNR) leads to a metaplastic increase in the threshold for LTP induction. TNR is an extracellular-matrix protein expressed by oligodendrocytes during myelination. Synaptic states Research in 2004 has shown that synapses do not strengthen or weaken on a sliding scale. There are discrete states that synapses move between. These states are active, silent, recently silent, potentiated, and depressed. The states which they can move to are dependent on the state that they are in at the moment. Thus, the future state is determined by the state gained by previous activity. For instance, silent (but not recently silent) synapses can be converted to active via the insertion of AMPARs in the postsynaptic membrane. Active synapses can move to either potentiated or depressed via LTP or LTD respectively. Prolonged low-frequency stimulation (5 Hz, the method used to induce LTD) can move an active synapse to depressed and then silent. However, synapses that have just become active cannot be depressed or silenced. Thus there is state-machine-like behavior at the synapse when it comes to transitions. However, the states themselves can have varying degrees of intensity. One active-state synapse can be stronger than another active-state synapse. This is, in theory, how you can have a strong memory vs. a weak memory. The strong memories are the ones with very heavily populated active synapses, while weak memories may still be active but poorly populated with AMPARs. The same research has shown that NMDA receptors themselves, once thought to be the control mechanism behind AMPA receptor organization, can be regulated by synaptic activity. This regulation of the regulation mechanism itself adds another layer of complexity to the biology of the brain. Synaptic tagging Recent research has found a mechanism known as synaptic tagging. When new receptor proteins are being expressed and synthesized they must also be transported to the synaptic membrane, and some sort of chemical messaging is required for this. Their research has shown that activation of cAMP/PKA signaling pathways is required for LTP induction due to its \\"tagging\\" nature. It was even shown that simple pharmacological activation of cAMP/PKA pathways was sufficient for the synapse to be tagged, completely independent of any sort of activity. NMDA receptors The NMDA receptor is made up of three subunits: NR1, a variable NR2 subunit, and a variable NR3 subunit. Two NR2 subunits in particular have been the subject of intense study: NR2A and NR2B. The NR2B subunit not only is more sensitive to glutamate and takes longer to desensitize, but also allows more calcium entrance into the cell when it opens. A low NR2A/NR2B ratio is generally correlated with a decreased threshold of activation caused by rearing animals in light-deprived environments. This has been shown experimentally via light deprivation studies in which it was shown that the NR2A/B ratio declined. The threshold can be increased in some situations via light exposure. Studies of this nature were used to find the critical period for formation of the visual system in cats. This shifting ratio is a measurement of LTD/LTP threshold and thus has been posited as a metaplasticity mechanism. Gliotransmitters Glial cells not only provide structural and nutritional support for neurons, but also provide processing support via chemicals known as gliotransmitters. Gliotransmitters include glutamate, ATP, and, more recently, the amino acid D-serine. Once thought to be glycine itself, D-serine serves as a ligand in the glycine site of NMDARs. D-serine is synthesized by astrocytes and is heavily co-localized with NMDARs. Without D-serine there can be no NMDA-induced neurotoxicity, or almost any NMDA response of any kind. Due to this evidence it is clear that D-serine is an essential ligand for the NMDA receptors. An essential factor in this research is the fact that astrocytes will vary their coverage of neurons based on the physiological processes of the body. Oxytocin and vasopressin neurons will have more NMDA receptors exposed due to astrocyte activity during lactation than during normal functioning. This research took place mostly in cells from the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON). Due to synaptic plasticity being almost completely dependent on NMDAR processing, dynamic astrocyte NMDAR coverage is by nature a metaplasticity parameter. Synaptic homeostasis Homeostatic plasticity manages synaptic connections across the entire cell in an attempt to keep them at manageable connection levels. Hebbian methods tend to drive networks into either a maximized state or a minimized state of firing, thus limiting the potential activity and growth of the network. With homeostatic mechanisms in place there is now a sort of \\"gain control\\" which allows these Hebbian methods to be checked in order to maintain their information processing abilities. This kind of modulation is important to combat intense lack of neural activity, such as prolonged sensory deprivation (in this study in particular it is light-deprivation affecting visual cortex neurons) or damage caused by stroke. Synaptic scaling is a mechanism in place to hold synapse sensitivity at normalized levels. Prolonged periods of inactivity increase the sensitivity of the synapses so that their overall activity level can remain useful. Chronic activity causes desensitization of the receptors, lowering overall activity to a more biologically manageable level. Both AMPA and NMDA receptor levels are affected by this process and so the overall \\"weight\\" of each synaptic connection (refined by Hebbian methods) is maintained while still increasing the overall level of activity over the entire neuron. It has been shown that both the presynaptic and the postsynaptic neuron are involved in the process, changing the vesicle turnover rate and AMPA receptor composition respectively. Recent research has found that the calcium-dependent enzyme CaMKII, which exists in an alpha and beta isoform, is key in inactivity-dependent modulation. A low alpha/beta ratio causes an increased threshold for cellular excitation via calcium influx and thus favors LTP. = Memory formation = There are several different stages of sleep, but only two separate types, REM (or rapid-eye movement) and NREM (non-rapid eye movement). NREM sleep is characterized by slow-wave neuronal activity known as theta waves, or delta waves. These slow- wave oscillations occur at very low frequencies, between 0.5 and 4.5 Hz.Tononi, G., & Cirelli, C. 2003, Sleep and Synaptic Homeostasis: A Hypothesis. Brain Research Bulletin 62 p143-150 A recent hypothesis has come to the surface, integrating sleep and something known as synaptic homeostasis. The hypothesis comes in four parts: # Wakefulness is associated with synaptic potentiation; # Synaptic potentiation is tied to the regulation of slow-wave activity in sleep; # Slow-wave activity is associated with synaptic depression; # Synaptic downscaling is tied to the beneficial effects of sleep. Wakefulness is associated with synaptic potentiation: Potentiation is happening all the time: through the many hours we spend reading useless information, or encountering something longer than 5 minutes, i.e. that random person who stood in front of us at the grocery store. Everything that we see, read, or focus on, is being potentiated somewhere in our brain. Synaptic potentiation is tied to the regulation of slow-wave activity in sleep: Whenever a particular area in our brain receives extensive potentiation from our day, the affected area undergoes more slow-wave activity than its neighbors do.Tononi, G., & Cirelli, C. 2006, Sleep Function and Synaptic Homeostasis. Sleep Medicine Reviews 10 p49-62 Knott, GC., Quairiaux, C., Genoud, C., & Welker, E. 2002, Formation of Dendritic Spines with GABAergic Synapses Induced by Whisker Stimulation in Adult Mice. Neuron 34 p265-273 In essence, the amount of potentiation we receive during our day, effects the type of sleep we get at night. If we spend all day sick and lying in bed, not much potentiation is happening. Sure, the colors of the walls, curtains, bed sheets, etc. but that isn't surprisingly interesting. The amount of slow-wave oscillation activity that would be present at night would not be extensive in the slightest. Slow-wave activity is associated with synaptic depression: Synaptic depression is the other side to synaptic potentiation. If LTP is formed from strongly depolarizing stimuli, or high frequency stimuli, then long-term depression, LTD, is formed from prolonged periods of very weak stimuli or very low frequency stimulus. The hypothesis proposes that the slow wave activity is enough to evoke LTD, or downscaling, of the cells. Synaptic downscaling is tied to the beneficial effects of sleep: This is what ties it all together. LTD from the synaptic downscaling of the slow wave activity causes just the right amount of reduction to our neuronal firing patterns. The prolonged LTD from sleep would allow for all the non-essential LTP that took place during our day to become forfeit. It helps reduce the amount of synaptic noise that is created when so much potentiation happens during the day. What does this all mean?: The idea is LTP is occurring all the time during wakefulness. All of this information flow and storage will eventually become too much, and that is why we sleep. The point of sleep is to downgrade and eliminate some of the synaptic potentials that are not necessary from throughout our day. What one was wearing on the third Tuesday last February is irrelevant, but knowing one's middle name isn't. Extensive LTP has been put in place to remember one's middle name, and therefore that synaptic pathway would not be so easily forgotten, whereas what one was wearing on that one particular day received so little potentiation it can be forgotten in a day or two. A lot of potentiation on a certain topic would help facilitate that memory, making it \\"more important\\" in the 'eyes of the cortex' so it is not forgotten. =What else may be involved= The circadian rhythm taking hold is responsible for the feeling of fatigue. Our body naturally starts to shut down, around the time that the sun starts to take its dip into the horizon. The primary chemical for this happening is melatonin, so it would seem natural to wonder if melatonin has some effect on learning and memory formation as well. Every animal that sleeps also exhibits some bodily concentration of melatonin. When studying the effects of sleepiness on fish, it was found that any significant amount of melatonin causes a \\"dramatic decrease\\" in learning and memory formation.Rawashdeh, O., Hernandez de Borsetti, N., Roman, G., & Cahill, GM. 2007, Melatonin Suppresses Nighttime Memory Formation in Zebrafish. Science 318 p1144-1147 This study was performed at night under bright lights, to inhibit the release of natural amounts of melatonin and learning behaviors were conducted. The authors also gave a drug to the fish to help block the effects of melatonin and then studied their behavioral patterns on memory formation and retrieval. It was found that in the daytime when melatonin was artificially administered, the fish's ability to learn new material was at its lowest. As one stays awake for a long time, so much extra potentiation has already happened from the waking day, and trying to force more LTP isn't going to help anything. Too much extra information is floating around, and the neurons can't handle all of the extra activity. In addition, however, as the night starts to loom, the circadian rhythm begins to take effect and the body naturally begins to release stores of melatonin. This increase in melatonin reduces the ability to learn and facilitate new memories. The ability for melatonin to suppress memory formation is very significant, however. The melatonin would work in conjunction with the LTD during slow oscillations during sleep, to keep individuals from potentiating unwanted, or unneeded, information from their day. Is sleep the only thing that matters in this synaptic homeostasis hypothesis? In February 2002, two separate articles were published on the discovery of a receptors' involvement in synaptic homeostasis.Aberle, H., Haghighi, PA., Fetter, RD., McCabe, BD., Magah√£es TR., & Goodman, CS. 2002, wishful thinking Encodes a BMP Type II Receptor that Regulates Synaptic Growth in Drosophila. Neuron 10 p545-558Marq√∫es, G., Bao, H., Haerry, TE., Shimell, MJ., Duchek, P., Zhang, B., & O'Connor, MB. 2002, The Drosophila BMP Type II Recptor Wishful Thinking Regulates Neuromuscular Synapse Morphology and Function. Neuron 33 p529-543 Bone morphogenetic proteins, BMPs, were originally found to cause a differentiation in bone formation;Wozney, JM., Rosen, V., Celeste, AJ., Mitsock, LM., Whitters, MJ., Kriz, RW., Hewick RM., & Wang, EA. 1988, Novel Regulators of Bone Formation: Molecular Clones and Activities. Science 242 p1528-1534 however, they have recently been discovered necessary for synaptic regulation. It was noticed that when there were mutations in the BMP type II receptor, more commonly known as wishful thinking or wit for short, the sizes of synaptic clefts were significantly reduced, as well as the synaptic output in the studied species. The amount of neurotransmitters that were stored and released by these cells was also found to be exceedingly lacking, so further studies were conducted. When the wit receptor is activated, a particular protein known as LIMK1 becomes active as well.Eaton, B., & Davis, GW. 2005, LIM Kinase1 Control Synaptic Stability Downstream of the Type II BMP Receptor. Neuron 47 p695-708 Eaton and Davis also studied the synaptic footprints of the cells. The synaptic footprints are indications that a synapse was once there, but no longer contains the axon terminus, and therefore the synaptic footprints are located in the postsynaptic cell in the dendrites. In mutated wit receptors, the amount of synaptic footprints was increased by almost 50%, indicating that the BMP receptor and its cellular counterpart, the LIMK1 protein, are significantly responsible for growth of a cell. Why is any of this important, and what does it mean? Significant amounts of LTP would be required if we are to keep our already formed memories. During sleep, the slow wave oscillations cause an overall synaptic depression throughout the brain, where only the stronger neuronal pathways are kept from the previous day's LTP. There is a second requirement, however, if we are to keep our neuronal synapses. The wishful thinking receptor also has to be active if the synapses are to be kept. If a newly formed synapse is the result from some potentiation from the day, then presumably that synapse would not have had the time to form the wit pathways from the cell. Without wishful thinking activation, the synapses are much more prone to destruction and would likely get removed, likewise, very heavily potentiated pathways would be much more likely to be kept, as BMP activation would very likely be prevalent. Endocannabinoids Research in 2004 has shown that endocannabinoid release from the postsynaptic neuron can inhibit activation of the presynaptic neuron. Type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs) are the receptors on the presynaptic neuron responsible for this effect. The specific ligand is thought to be 2-arachidonyl glycerol, or 2-AG. This has mainly been found in GABAergic synapses and thus has been termed inhibitory long term depression (I-LTD). This effect has been found to be extremely localized and accurate, meaning the cannabinoids do not diffuse far from their intended target. This inhibition of inhibitory neurotransmission primes proximal excitatory synapses for future LTP induction and is thus metaplastic in nature. Neuronal adaptation mechanism A new mechanism has been proposed that concerns the innate excitability of a neuron. It is quantified by the size of the hyperpolarization in mV due to K+ channels re-opening during an action potential. After any sort of learning task, particularly a classical or operant conditioning task, the amplitude of the K+ hyperpolarization, or \\"after hyperpolarization (AHP)\\", is greatly reduced. Over time this AHP will return to normal levels. This normalization does not correlate with a loss of memory but instead a loss of learning potential.

It is the principal oxide of nickel. It is classified as a basic metal oxide. Several million kilograms are produced annually of varying quality, mainly as an intermediate in the production of nickel alloys.The mineralogical form of , bunsenite, is very rare. Other nickel(III) oxides have been claimed, for example: and , but they have yet to be proven by X-ray crystallography. Production can be prepared by multiple methods. Upon heating above 400 ¬∞C, nickel powder reacts with oxygen to give . In some commercial processes, green nickel oxide is made by heating a mixture of nickel powder and water at 1000 ¬∞C, the rate for this reaction can be increased by the addition of .\\"Handbook of Inorganic Chemicals\\", Pradniak, Pradyot; McGraw-Hill Publications,2002 The simplest and most successful method of preparation is through pyrolysis of a nickel(II) compounds such as the hydroxide, nitrate, and carbonate, which yield a light green powder. Synthesis from the elements by heating the metal in oxygen can yield grey to black powders which indicates nonstoichiometry. Structure adopts the structure, with octahedral Ni2+ and O2‚àí sites. The conceptually simple structure is commonly known as the rock salt structure. Like many other binary metal oxides, is often non-stoichiometric, meaning that the Ni:O ratio deviates from 1:1. In nickel oxide, this non-stoichiometry is accompanied by a color change, with the stoichiometrically correct NiO being green and the non-stoichiometric being black. Applications and reactions has a variety of specialized applications and generally applications distinguish between \\"chemical grade\\", which is relatively pure material for specialty applications, and \\"metallurgical grade\\", which is mainly used for the production of alloys. It is used in the ceramic industry to make frits, ferrites, and porcelain glazes. The sintered oxide is used to produce nickel steel alloys. Charles √âdouard Guillaume won the 1920 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on nickel steel alloys which he called invar and elinvar. was also a component in the nickel-iron battery, also known as the Edison Battery, and is a component in fuel cells. It is the precursor to many nickel salts, for use as specialty chemicals and catalysts. More recently, was used to make the NiCd rechargeable batteries found in many electronic devices until the development of the environmentally superior NiMH battery. an anodic electrochromic material, have been widely studied as counter electrodes with tungsten oxide, cathodic electrochromic material, in complementary electrochromic devices. About 4000 tons of chemical grade are produced annually. Black is the precursor to nickel salts, which arise by treatment with mineral acids. is a versatile hydrogenation catalyst. Heating nickel oxide with either hydrogen, carbon, or carbon monoxide reduces it to metallic nickel. It combines with the oxides of sodium and potassium at high temperatures (>700 ¬∞C) to form the corresponding nickelate. Electronic structure NiO is useful for illustrating the failure of density functional theory (using functionals based on the local-density approximation) and Hartree‚ÄìFock theory to account for the strong correlation. The term strong correlation refers to behavior of electrons in solids that is not well described (often not even in a qualitatively correct manner) by simple one- electron theories such as the local-density approximation (LDA) or Hartree‚ÄìFock theory. For instance, the seemingly simple material NiO has a partially filled 3d-band (the Ni atom has 8 of 10 possible 3d-electrons) and therefore would be expected to be a good conductor. However, strong Coulomb repulsion (a correlation effect) between d-electrons makes NiO instead a wide band gap Mott insulator. Thus, strongly correlated materials have electronic structures that are neither simply free-electron-like nor completely ionic, but a mixture of both.

Published by Harcourt Brace, the thriller was his fourth novel, following three for Random House (The Hospital, Dagger of the Mind, Clark Gifford's Body) and five collections of his poetry. The story first appeared in abridged form in The American Magazine (October 1946), as \\"The Judas Picture\\". The story was adapted for three films: The Big Clock (1948) starring Ray Milland, Police Python 357 (1976) starring Yves Montand and No Way Out (1987) starring Kevin Costner. Plot George Stroud works for a New York magazine publisher not unlike Time-Life. Stroud begins an intermittent affair with Pauline, the girlfriend of his boss, Earl Janoth. One night, Stroud leaves Pauline at the corner near her apartment, just as Janoth returns from a trip. The next day, Pauline is found murdered in her apartment. Janoth knows someone saw him enter Pauline's apartment on the night of the murder, but he doesn't know who that was. To find out, Janoth tells his staff to track the witness, and Stroud is put in charge of the investigation. Development history Fearing based the novel on the October 1943 murder of New York brewery heiress Patricia Burton Bernheimer Lonergan\\"Defense Rests in Murder Trial of Wayne Lonergan\\" The Evening Independent, March 1944 and Sam Fuller's 1944 thriller, The Dark Page. A combination of these two suggested a plot thread to Fearing, and he began writing The Big Clock during August 1944, continuing to work on the manuscript for over a year. He married artist Nan Lurie in 1945, and much of the novel was written in her loft on East 10th Street in New York City. The manuscript was completed by October 1945, and it was published by Harcourt Brace a year later. In his introduction to Kenneth Fearing: Complete Poems (1994), Robert M. Ryley described the events of publication and the aftermath: :Published in the fall of 1946, The Big Clock made Fearing temporarily rich. Altogether he took in about $60,000 (roughly $360,000 in 1992 dollars): about $10,000 in royalties and from the sale of republication rights (including a condensation in The American Magazine), and $50,000 from the sale of film rights to Paramount. In 1947, Nan won $2,000 in an art competition, a sum they dismissed as negligible but that only two years earlier would have seemed a fortune. But Fearing's successes always contained the germ of disaster. Overestimating his business acumen, he had negotiated his own contract with Paramount, permanently and irrevocably signing away his film rights, and relinquishing his television rights till 1952, by which time, he discovered to his rage and frustration, Paramount was showing late-night reruns and had thus cornered the market. A more immediate problem was alcohol. He told his friend Alice Neel (the model for Louise Patterson, the eccentric painter in The Big Clock) that since he could now afford to start drinking in the morning, he was having trouble getting any work done. On one occasion he almost died from a combination of scotch and phenobarbital, and in 1952 he was so shaken by his doctor's warnings about the condition of his liver that he went on the wagon. For Nan, who for years had been trying to get him to stop drinking, this should have been a cause for rejoicing, but she discovered that without alcohol he was no longer \\"playful\\" and \\"romantic\\" and that she was no longer interested in the marriage.Ryley, Robert M.

Biography Her family lived in Petersburg (and later in Leningrad), but Manina was born in Petrozavodsk, where her father was on a long mission. During the German-Soviet War she was evacuated from besieged Leningrad into Tashkent. She returned into Leningrad in 1944 and began gymnastics at the Leningrad Young Pioneer Palace in the same year. She was called \\"Monia the Bird\\" by groupmates for her graceful and light vaults. Competing as a junior, she won the all-around title at the USSR Nationals in 1953, and became a candidate for the USSR team. In the same year Manina debuted at the senior USSR Championships, placing 12th in the all-around. Between 1953 and 1964 Manina successfully competed in many national and international events. One of Manina's most successful performances took place at the 1954 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, where she earned several gold medals on vault, on the floor and in the team competition. At the 1956 Olympics she rivalled √Ågnes Keleti, Larisa Latynina, and other strong competitors, and placed 6th in the all-around, but won silver medals on vault and balance beam. She also contributed to the team's gold and bronze medals. The USSR team won more gold medals than any other country at that year's Olympics. In one of her interviews Manina said, that the team had a warm welcome everywhere in the USSR: on their way by train from Vladivostok to Moscow they were met with flowers on each small station, people organized solemn meetings and made other arrangements to honor their visit. Although in the event finals of the 1958 Worlds Manina, apart from the gold in the team competition, won a silver medal, on vault, she placed 3rd in the all-around to Latynina and Eva Bos√°kov√°. She missed the 1960 Summer Olympics due to an injury, but competed in the 1962 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, contributing to the team's gold and winning the bronze on vault. At age 30 she went to the 1964 Summer Olympics and won the team's gold and silver on the balance beam. Finishing her competitive career, Manina seriously injured her ankle during the display competition in Vienna and was not able to continue training afterward. She coached the French national team in 1975 and has been an international judge since 1971. Manina is also known for her scientific activities. Starting in 1958, she studied at the Leningrad State Institute of Fine Mechanics and Optics, and graduated in 1965. She defended a dissertation for the Candidate of Science degree at the Lesgaft State Institute of Physical Culture in 1969 and taught at the gymnastics department of the institute until 1973. Since 1975 she has been a professor at the Saint Petersburg State Art- Industrial Academy. She has published more than 40 scientific, methodical and popular science books. Tamara Manina lives and works in Saint Petersburg. She is married to Valery Lutkov, a sports medicine doctor, and has a son.

He was a professor of sociology, social work and business administration at the University of Michigan, noted for contributions to the sociology of organizations and social movements. Biography Mayer Zald was born in Detroit on June 17, 1931. His Ph.D. advisor and mentor was Morris Janowitz. His doctoral dissertation was on Multiple Goals and Staff Relations: A Comparative Study of Correctional Institutions for Juvenile Delinquents. He earned both his BA (1953) and PhD (1961) at University of Michigan, with MA (1955) from the University of Hawaii. He then taught at the University of Chicago (1960‚Äì1964) and Vanderbilt University (1964‚Äì1977), before returning to the University of Michigan in 1977. During his career, he was chairman of the sociology department at Vanderbilt University from 1971 to 1975. He was twice chairman of the sociology department at Michigan from 1981 to 1986 and again from 1990 to 1992. He was a professor of sociology, social work, and business administration at the University of Michigan, where he taught from 1977, eventually holding a position of Distinguished Senior Faculty Lecturer in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts; in 2001 he became a professor emeritus. In the period 1997-2001 he also was a Visiting Distinguished Professor at the University of Arizona. In 2002 he was a Visiting Professor at the University of California, San Diego. In 2007-2008 he was a Visiting Distinguished Professor of Sociology at University of California, Irvine. In 2010, Mayer returned to Vanderbilt University to deliver the inaugural lecture in the Department of Sociology's Distinguished Social Movement Scholar Lecture Series. He was on Board of Editors of the American Journal of Sociology from 1960 to 1970, its Associate Editor in the period 1962-63, and Advisory Editor in 1974-78. He was also on Boards of Editors of Social Problems (1964‚Äì68) and Journal of Health and Social Behavior (1967‚Äì70). In the period of 1979-82 he was the Associate Editor of the American Sociological Review. In 1995 he was on the Editorial Board of the Mobilization: an International Journal. Zald served as chairs of the Collective Behavior and Social Movements section of the American Sociological Association (ASA) in 1982-83 and also for the Section on Occupations & Organizations in 1985-1986; he served as a vice president for the ASA in 1986-87. He also served on several of ASA's committees. He was nominated (but not elected) for the President of the American Sociological Association twice (in 1990 and in 1992). He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He died in Ann Arbor in 2012, following a heart attack. Work and influence On his home page at Michigan Zald wrote that his research focused \\"on social movement theory, organizational theory, and on sociology as a science and a humanities\\". Zald made substantial contributions to the field of social movement research. The term social movement organization (SMO) entered the literature through the work of Zald and Roberta Ash (now Garner) (Zald, Mayer N. and Roberta Ash, Social Movement Organizations: Growth, Decay and Change. Social Forces 44:327-341, 1966). As of 2012 their article in Social Forces was one of top 10 most frequently cited articles ever published in this journal. With John D. McCarthy, Zald developed the resource mobilization theory, which became one of the major theories on social movements. Zald‚Äôs article with McCarthy, ‚ÄúResource Mobilization and Social Movements: A Partial Theory,‚Äù published in the American Journal of Sociology in May 1977, has been described by Jeff Goodwin as one of the most influential and frequently cited articles in the field and in the discipline. Zald and McCarthy called \\"attention to the rising trend of professional activism in social movements and [applied] general principles of organizational dynamics to\\" social movement organizations. Zald wrote more than 60 articles in all and wrote and edited nearly two dozen books; as of May 2012 his CV listed 21 Books and Monographs, 67 Empirical Studies and Theoretical Essays, 44 \\"Review Articles and Commentaries\\" and 5 \\"Pamphlets and Reports\\". His works included including Social Movements in an Organizational Society: Collected Essays (with John McCarthy) (1987), Comparative Perspectives on Social Movements (with Doug McAdam and John McCarthy) (1996), and Social Movements and the Transformation of American Health Care (with Jane Banaszak-Holl and Sandra Levitsky) (2010). In 2008 he received the John D. McCarthy Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Scholarship of Social Movements and Collective Behavior from the Center for the Study of Social Movements and Social Change at University of Notre Dame.

His father, Ismail as-Sadr (d. 1920) was a Grand Ayatollah and the first to be use the as- Sadr surname, which came to be associated with a long line of religious scholarship within Shia Islam. Haydar and the as-Sadr family are also considered as Sayyid, or those who can trace their lineage back to Muhammad (d. 632). The family's lineage is traced through Imam Jafar al-Sadiq and his son Imam Musa al-Kazim the sixth and seventh Shia Imams respectively. This direct and meticulously documented lineage is unprecedented even among the illustrious families in the Islamic world who claim such lineage. The Shia Muslims consider themselves the followers of Muhammad's bloodline, thus a great deal of respect and reverence is paid to the Sayyids throughout society. Some of the well known relatives of Haydar al-Sadr include his brother, Sadr al-Din Sadr (d. 1954), his nephew Moussa as-Sadr and another nephew Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr. Haydar was considered a grand marja at-taqlid (supreme religious authority) of his time. A marja' at-taqlƒ´d, literally, means \\"reference point for emulation\\", or one who through his learning and probity is qualified to be followed in all points of religious practice and Islamic law by the generality of Shi'is.

It was also the name of one of ten ancient administrative Hundreds of Cornwall. The Battle of Stratton during the Civil War took place here on 16 May 1643.1643: Civil War in the South-West The British Civil Wars & Commonwealth website A local saying is \\"Stratton was a market town when Bude was just a furzy down\\", meaning Stratton was long established when Bude was just gorse-covered downland.A similar saying is quoted for many other competing Westcountry towns, for example Saltash about Plymouth and North Molton about South Molton. Etymology The earliest form of the name in Old English is Str√¶tneat deriving from the original Cornish \\"Strad-Neth\\", with Strad meaning \\"The flat-bottomed valley of the River\\" and Neth being the name of the river itself.Weatherhill, Craig (2009) A Concise Dictionary of Cornish Place-names. Westport, Co. Mayo: Evertype; p. 65 In common with most hydronymy in Western Europe, the name Neth is known to be Celtic or Pre-Celtic, however the etymology of the name remains uncertain. A meaning of shining or brilliant has been suggested, as has a link to the older Indo-European root *-nedi (simply meaning river). Today, the river is commonly referred to as the Strat in English, from an erroneous back formation of Stratton (\\"town on the Strat\\"). The town likely shares it's etymology with the river and town of Neath in South Wales and the River Nidd in Northern England. History Stratton Methodist Church Will of Alfred the Great, AD 873‚Äì888, mentions Str√¶tneat (11th-century copy, British Library Stowe MS 944, ff. 29v‚Äì33r)Charter S 1507 at the Electronic Sawyer The earliest known references to Stratton are found in King Alfred‚Äôs Will of c. 880 and the Domesday survey of 1086. (For the Stratton Hundred: see under Government below.) At the time of the Domesday Survey the manor of Stratton had land for 30 ploughs. There were 30 villeins, 20 smallholders and 20 slaves. There were 10 salt houses, 20 acres of woodland, 200 acres of pasture, 30 cattle and 300 sheep. Before the conquest the manor had been held by Bishop Osbern and Alfred the Marshal; its value in 1086 was ¬£35-18-4d.Thorn, Caroline, et al. (eds.) Cornwall. Chichester: Phillimore; entry 5,1,3 Stratton Manor House on Diddies Road has now been converted into apartments. The town has given its name to a traditional folk ballad \\"The Stratton Carol\\". Religion One of the most prominent buildings in Stratton is the 12th century Norman church dedicated to Saint Andrew which holds a central and elevated position within the town. It is listed Grade I. The church contains a brass to Sir John Arundell of Trerice, 1561.Dunkin, E. (1882) Monumental Brasses. London: Spottiswoode As well as the main church, there were also other chapels around the village; this indicates a large population because only one church wouldn‚Äôt suffice. This is also supported by the existence of the large, old tithe barn; it needed to be large enough to hold the tax of one-tenth of their earnings/produce that all villagers paid to the church. The area around Cot Hill was an important sanctuary for pilgrims travelling the pilgrimage route to Hartland during Medieval times. However, many of the chapels are derelict or have now been converted, suggesting the population decline has been so great as to leave only enough people to use the church and one remaining chapel. Justice The town once had a jail, a police station and a courthouse, but the police station has now been moved to Bude, the jail demolished and the courthouse converted into two dwellings. The door of the jail, marked \\"CLINK\\", is still visible in the church porch. The following quotation indicates Stratton's importance as a centre of justice \\"As Stratton Town and the surrounding villages grew, the need to administer civil and criminal law from an appropriate location was necessary.\\"Bill Young & Bryan Dudley Stamp (2002) Stratton Past & Present. Bude: Bill Young Government The name Stratton was given to the unit of government for taxation during Saxon times, known as a ‚ÄòHundred‚Äô. Stratton was the head of its hundred due to its importance in comparison to that of the local towns and villages, including Kilkhampton, Marhamchurch, Boyton, Jacobstow, Whitstone, Stratton itself, Poughill, Bridgerule, Week St Mary, Launcells, North Tamerton and Morwenstow. Other than the loss of Bridgerule, the Stratton Hundred remained undisturbed until the demise of the Stratton Rural District in the 1970s. The Hundred is an indicator of Stratton‚Äôs importance not only for these reasons, but also because in the whole of Cornwall, there were only nine Hundreds and all of them had their own courts, this suggests that not only did Stratton have a courthouse, it was probably the only one in the Stratton Hundred. (At the time of Domesday Book there were only seven hundreds: the hundred of Trigg was later divided into Trigg, Lesnewth and Stratton. Stratton manor was the head manor of Trigg hundred in Domesday Book.) Trade and industry The Tree Inn Trade and industry greatly affected Stratton‚Äôs popularity; it had a thriving leather and agricultural trade. During medieval times it dealt in leather, evidence of this is the road named after the trade; Poundfield area was where the animals were kept, Stratton also housed tanning pits and a rack park, where the leather was stretched. There is also evidence of farming in the milking parlours, barns and stalls that are made from cob, a traditional building material, and the Old Malt House shows where ale was produced in the church owned brewery. During medieval times herbs and spices were also considered important, for medicinal purposes as well as others, and Stratton was famous for having an abundance of wild garlic. Trade events such as markets and fairs were a regular occurrence in Stratton and people would come from all around to attend. Much of the evidence for events and trades in Stratton is subtle, for example street names like Market Street and Poundfield Lane. Stratton had up to 14 pubs, although some were houses where people brewed beer themselves. Many have now been knocked down or converted, however some, for example the Tree Inn, are still running, despite perhaps fewer customers than they would have expected before Bude became the main town. Although many of the shops that once lined the streets have now been converted into homes, the large front windows still hint at the lives led by the inhabitants when Stratton was the most important town in the area. =19th and 20th centuries= Stratton war memorial Trade directories allow us to compare the two towns, for example, in 1844, when Stratton had six shoemakers, Bude had only one, although Slater‚Äôs Trade Directory 1852-1853 shows the period in which Bude was beginning to catch up, although Stratton was still thriving. One of the main factors which led to the demise of Stratton‚Äôs influence was New Road which directed traffic away from the centre of Stratton in the early 20th century. The bypass was then built in 1950 when Stratton was well and truly defeated. Following the 1960s rail closures Stratton and Bude became the two towns most remote from the rail network in England. Despite the downfall of Stratton, it still managed to keep the hospital and surgery running although the union and workhouse from the 1830s was no longer operating.

The game was developed by Iguana Entertainment and published by Acclaim Entertainment for the Nintendo 64 in 1998 for North America and in 1999 for Europe. It was later ported to Microsoft Windows and PlayStation (port developed by Appaloosa Interactive) in 1999 for the release year to coincide with the film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. A Game Boy Color version developed by Crawfish Interactive was in development, but it was eventually cancelled due to South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker stating that the game would not be fitting on the Game Boy Color as that console was marketed towards children. However, they did keep a few copies of the Game Boy Color version to commemorate what was originally started as the first South Park game. Despite the Nintendo 64 version's positive reception, the PC and PlayStation versions of South Park were panned by critics. A Dreamcast version was planned for a 2000 release, but was cancelled during development for unknown reasons. In 2018, a ROM image of the Game Boy Color version was leaked online. Gameplay South Park is a first-person shooter. The game's single-player mode places the player in control of one of the four main characters of South Park (Cartman, Kyle, Stan or Kenny). The player must defeat a variety of enemies using the various weapons found throughout each stage in order to reach the exit point at the end. In addition to completing levels, the player must also prevent large enemies in the stage (dubbed 'Tanks') from reaching the exit before they do. If they fail to do so, they will be forced to defend South Park from the 'Tanks' in a short minigame called the 'Penalty Round' after the stage. =Multiplayer= In Head-to-Head mode, the players select a level, characters, and game style (time-limited, damage limited, or unending). The Microsoft Windows version allows for online head-to-head play. In the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions, upon reaching select stages in single player mode, codes are revealed. These can then be input into the \\"Cheesy Poofs Decoder\\" to unlock additional characters for Head-to-Head play. All characters are unlocked in the Microsoft Windows version. In the Nintendo 64 version, you can choose between 20 characters and 17 multiplayer levels. Story A mysterious comet is approaching the earth, described by the opening narration as a force of concentrated evil that no force of good can stand against. As it comes closer, South Park is beset by enemies, including rabid mutant turkeys, deformed clones of the townsfolk, alien visitors, berserk robots, and sentient killer toys. Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny hear about the dangers from Chef, and take up arms to investigate their sources and defend the town. Reception South Parks reception depended on the platform. Overall, the game was met with negative critical reception with the PC and PlayStation versions, while the Nintendo 64 version generally received mixed to positive reviews from critics. The PlayStation and PC versions received poor reception due to the bad graphics, poor visuals and bad voice acting. The Nintendo 64 version received the best reviews upon release. Aggregating review website GameRankings gave the Nintendo 64 version 67.11%, the PC version 51.72% and the PlayStation version 41.22%. Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated: \\"once the initial chuckles wear off, whether in multiplayer or single-player mode, you're left with a first-person shooter much like any other, and in fact, not as well-designed as most. It's as fun as the show it's based on, but its appeal is just as fleeting.\\" GameSpot gave the PlayStation version a 1.4/10, stating: \\"South Park is definitely one of those games that is bound to come up when you start thinking about the worst game you've ever played.\\" IGN called the PlayStation version \\"frustrating\\" due to poor graphics, repetition of the voice acting, and lack of play value for the head-to-head mode. GameSpot stated of the PC version: \\"A good license and good graphics aren't enough.\\" The voice acting, done by the original voice actors, was criticized for being repetitive, isolated, and old. The weapons of the game were also criticized for being unprofessional. Despite the negative reception from the Windows and PlayStation versions, the Nintendo 64 version was praised for its 3D graphics and storyline, with IGN calling the game \\"just as funny as the Comedy Central series.\\" GameSpot stated in the Nintendo 64 version that the level design was \\"really not very good on its own, but given the license, it at least makes sense.\\" Sequel A spiritual sequel in the style of a sandbox action- adventure game was in development for the PlayStation 2, Gamecube and Xbox, but was not finished. Little was known about the game until a build was found on an Xbox development kit, but only video footage of the beta build has been released to the public. The footage appears to showcase the PlayStation 2 version, due to the visual button displays used in the game. A cutscene from the game was even leaked on YouTube showing Cartman in a mental hospital.

Early life Boy in a Blue Hat. 1903. Oil on canvas by John Quinton Pringle Muslin Street, Bridgeton, Glasgow by John Quinton Pringle (detail) Pringle was born the son of a railway employee in Dennistoun, Glasgow. Though the family moved for a short time (1869 to 1874) to Langbank in nearby Renfrewshire (where his father had been appointed stationmaster), John received his education in Glasgow and later lived for some time in Maukinfauld Road, Tollcross. He left school in 1876 and was apprenticed to an optical repairman. Twenty years later he set up in business on his own, offering optical and electrical repairs in his shop in No. 90 Saltmarket, near Glasgow Cross. It was a famously chaotically run shop, but Pringle kept it running as a business (albeit a sideline from his real love) for over 20 years. Meanwhile, he pursued a vocation in painting. Pringle attended evening and Saturday morning classes (at the same time as Charles Rennie Mackintosh) between 1883 and 1888. In 1901 he won a gold medal for life drawing at the South Kensington national competition. Life as a painter Pringle left about 100 works. Many are small scale oil on canvas, with subjects often including his family, friends, backcourts or local surroundings. He did not paint in oils between 1911 and 1921. Pringle visited Normandy in 1910 and spent a couple of summers on the Shetland island of Whalsay, (where he stayed with the local doctor, W.G. Wilson). In both cases he produced a range of sea or landscapes, often experimenting with painterly effects. Later he produced portraits (often miniatures) on commission, some of which are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Pringle was influenced by the French painter Jules Bastien-Lepage, whose paintings had been exhibited in Glasgow, along with those of other French painters, during the 1880s. He was most obviously influenced in technique, though the interest local subjects are another shared concern. In later works he used paint dissolved in turpentine and applied this in short strokes using a square brush. His palette in any one painting was limited but intense - his technique often giving a luminous or shimmering effect. He exhibited at the Vienna Secessionist Exhibition of 1902 and in the Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, in 1914. A Centenary Exhibition was held by Kelvingrove Art Gallery, Glasgow in 1964. Pringle died in East Kilbride on 25 April 1925. He is buried in Sandymount, Shettleston, in the east end of Glasgow.

Decree Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet \\"About the transfer of the Crimean Oblast\\". Supreme Council Herald, 9 March 1954. On 19 February 1954, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued a decree transferring the Crimean Oblast from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to the Ukrainian SSR. The documents which are now housed at the State Archive of the Russian Federation (GARF) do confirm that the move was originally approved by the Presidium of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) on 25 January 1954, paving the way for the authorizing resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union three weeks later. According to the Soviet Constitution (article 18), the borders of a republic within the Soviet Union could not be re-drawn without the agreement of the republic in question. The transfer was approved by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The constitutional change (articles 22 and 23) to accommodate the transfer was made several days after the decree issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. The decree was first announced, on the front page of Pravda, on 27 February 1954. The full text of the decree was: > On April 26, 1954 The decree of the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet > transferring the Crimea Oblast from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR. > Taking into account the integral character of the economy, the territorial > proximity and the close economic and cultural ties between the Crimea > Province and the Ukrainian SSR, the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet > decrees: To approve the joint presentation of the Presidium of the Russian > SFSR Supreme Soviet and the Presidium of the Ukrainian SSR Supreme Soviet on > the transfer of the Crimea Province from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian > SSR. Consequently, amendments were made to the republican constitutions of Russia and Ukraine. On 2 June 1954 the Supreme Soviet of Russia adopted amendments to the Russian Constitution of 1937, which, among other things, excluded Crimea from list of subdivisions enumerated in article 14, and on 17 June 1954, the Verkhovna Rada added Crimea to article 18 of the 1937 Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR.  Question of constitutionality  According to a 2009 article on Russian website Pravda.ru, the Presidium of the Supreme Council gathered for a session on 19 February 1954 when only 13 of 27 members were present. There was no quorum, but the decision was adopted unanimously. The earlier published documents and materials that have emerged more recently confirm that the transfer of Crimea from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR was carried out in accordance with the 1936 Soviet constitution, which in Article 18 stipulated that \\"the territory of a Union Republic may not be altered without its consent.\\" The proceedings of the USSR Supreme Soviet Presidium meeting indicate that both the Russian SFSR and the Ukrainian SSR had given their consent via their republic parliaments. On 27 June 2015, after the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation accepted the request of the leader of A Just Russia party, Sergey Mironov, to evaluate legitimacy of 1954 transfer of Crimea and stated that the transfer violated both the and the Constitution of the Soviet Union. The text of the document signed by Russian Deputy Prosecutor General Sabir Kekhlerov stated: \\"Neither the Constitution of the RSFSR or the USSR Constitution provide powers of the Presidium Supreme Soviet of the USSR for the consideration of the changes in the constitutional legal status of the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, members of the union republics. In view of the above, the decision adopted in 1954 by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviets of the RSFSR and the Soviet on the transfer of the Crimean region of the RSFSR to the USSR, did not correspond to the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the RSFSR and the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the USSR.\\" Complications of the \\"personal gesture\\" The transfer of the Crimean Oblast to Ukraine has been described as a \\"symbolic gesture\\", marking the 300th anniversary of Ukraine becoming a part of the Tsardom of Russia. That \\"symbolic gesture\\" came out as a post factum and was never discussed as one of the reasons prior to the transfer. It was also attributed to Nikita Khrushchev, although the person who signed the document was Kliment Voroshilov. Nina Khrushcheva, the political scientist and great-granddaughter of Nikita Khrushchev, the then General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union said of Khrushchev's motivation \\"it was somewhat symbolic, somewhat trying to reshuffle the centralized system and also, full disclosure, Nikita Khrushchev was very fond of Ukraine, so I think to some degree it was also a personal gesture toward his favorite republic. He was ethnically Russian, but he really felt great affinity with Ukraine.\\" Sergei Khrushchev, Khrushchev's son, claimed that the decision was due to the building of a hydro-electric dam on the Dnieper River and the consequent desire for all the administration to be under one body.Khrushchev‚Äôs Son: Giving Crimea Back to Russia Not an Option, Andre de Nesnera, Voice of America, March 6, 2014 Sevastopol in Crimea being the site of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, a quintessential element of Russian and then of Soviet foreign policy, the transfer had the intended effect of binding Ukraine inexorably to Russia, \\"Eternally Together\\", as a poster commemorating the event of 1954 proclaimed. The transfer was described by some of the Supreme Soviet as a gift to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the Treaty of Pereyaslav in 1654 when the Cossack Rada apparently decided to unify with Muscovy, putting in place the eventual acquisition of Ukraine by Russia. Other reasons given were the integration of the economies of Ukraine and Crimea and the idea that Crimea was a natural extension of the Ukrainian steppes. There was also a desire to repopulate parts of the Crimea which had suffered large-scale expulsions of its native Tatars to Central Asia in 1944.To understand Crimea, take a look back at its complicated history, Adam Taylor, The Washington Post, February 27, 2014 Aftermath The transfer increased the ethnic Russian population of Ukraine by almost a million people. Prominent Russian politicians such as Alexander Rutskoy considered the transfer to be controversial.Vladimir P. Lukin, ‚ÄúOur Security Predicament‚Äù, Foreign Policy, No. 88 (Autumn, 1992), pp. 57‚Äì75 Controversies surrounding the legality of the transfer remained a sore point in relations between Ukraine and Russia for the first few years after the breakup of the Soviet Union, and in particular in the internal politics of the Crimea. However, in a 1997 treaty between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, Russia recognized Ukraine's borders, and accepted Ukraine's sovereignty over Crimea.Subtelny, Orest, Ukraine: A History (University of Toronto Press) 2000, , 600 In January 1992, the Supreme Soviet of Russia questioned the constitutionality of the transfer, accusing Nikita Khrushchev of treason against the Russian people and said that the transfer was illegitimate.USSR's Nikita Khrushchev gave Russia‚Äôs Crimea away to Ukraine in only 15 minutes, Pravda.ru, 19 February 2009 Alexander Rutskoy, the former Vice President of Russia, said that this was a ‚Äúharebrained scheme‚Äù for which Khrushchev was famous saying that those who signed the document must have been suffering from sunstroke or hangovers.Page 5, Crimea: Dynamics, Challenges and Prospects, edited by Maria Drohobycky There was confusion about the status of Sevastopol and whether it was a part of the transfer as it had a degree of independence from the Crimean Oblast and never formally ratified the transfer,Forget Kiev. The Real Fight Will Be for Crimea, Andrei Malgin, Moscow Times, February 25, 2014 although it was later mentioned as Ukrainian territory in the Soviet Constitution and the Belavezha Accords between Ukraine and Russia. In 1994, a Russian nationalist administration under Yuriy Meshkov took over in Crimea with the promise to return Crimea to Russia, although these plans were later shelved.Celestine Bohlen, Russia vs. Ukraine: A Case of the Crimean Jitters, The New York Times (March 23, 1994). After the overthrow of President Victor Yanukovych during the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, the territories of Sevastopol and Crimea were seized by the Russian Federation; the annexation was formalized following an unconstitutional referendum in which 96% of the Crimean population purportedly voted \\"Yes.\\" This move was denounced by the new Ukrainian government and disregarded by most UN states, which continue to recognize Crimea as part of Ukraine. The Venice Commission (an advisory body of the Council of Europe in the field of constitutional law) issued an opinion in 2014, concluding that the referendum was illegal under the Ukrainian constitution and that \\"circumstances in Crimea did not allow the holding of a referendum in line with European democratic standards.\\"Opinion no. 762 / 2014, Venice Commission (March 21, 2014).

It has a vivid yellow color and is insoluble in all solvents. Two polymorphs of lead chromate are known, orthorhombic and the more stable monoclinic form. Monoclinic lead chromate is used in paints under the name chrome yellow. It occurs also as the mineral crocoite. Lead(II) chromate may also be known as chrome yellow, chromic acid lead(II) salt, canary chrome yellow 40-2250, Holtint Middle Chrome, chrome green, chrome green UC61, chrome green UC74, chrome green UC76, chrome lemon, crocoite, dianichi chrome yellow G, lemon yellow, king's yellow, Leipzig yellow, lemon yellow, Paris yellow, pigment green 15, plumbous chromate, pure lemon chrome L3GS. Structure Lead chromate adopts the monazite structure, meaning that the connectivity of the atoms is very similar to other compounds of the type MM'O4. Pb(II) has a distorted coordination sphere being surrounded by eight oxides with Pb-O distances ranging from 2.53 to 2.80 √Ö. The chromate anion is tetrahedral, as usual.Quareni, S.; de Pieri, R. \\"A three-dimensional refinement of the structure of crocoite, PbCrO4\\" Acta Crystallographica 1965, volume 19, p287-p289.  Applications  Lead chromate is used as the bright yellow pigment in Sunflowers, a painting by van Gogh. Approximately 37,000 tons were produced in 1996. The main applications are as a pigment in paints, under the name chrome yellow. It has also been used in the paint applied to North American school buses. Preparation Lead(II) chromate can be produced by treating sodium chromate with lead salts such as lead(II) nitrate or by combining lead(II) oxide with chromic acid. Related lead sulfochromate pigments are produced by the replacement of some chromate by sulfate, resulting in a mixed lead-chromate-sulfate compositions Pb(CrO4)1-x(SO4)x. This replacement is easy because sulfate and chromate are isostructural. Since sulfate is colorless, sulfochromates with high values of x are less intensely colored than lead chromate.  Reactions  Heating in hydroxide solution produces chrome red, a red or orange powder made by PbO and CrO3. Also, in hydroxide solution lead chromate slowly dissolves forming plumbite complex. ::PbCrO4 \\\\+ 4 OH‚àí ‚Üí [Pb(OH)4]2‚àí \\\\+ CrO42‚àí  Safety hazards  Despite containing both lead and hexavalent chromium, lead chromate is not particularly toxic because of it very low solubility. Lead chromate is treated with great care in its manufacture, the main concerns being dust of the chromate precursor. \\"[E]xtensive epidemiological investigations have given no indication that the practically insoluble lead chromate pigments have any carcinogenic properties\\".

Publication history Scanner first appeared as Screener in Avengers #357 and then as Scanner in Uncanny X-Men #300, and was created by Scott Lobdell and John Romita Jr.. Fictional character biography As a member of the Acolytes, Scanner served as a scout that would survey the area before the others arrived, using her mutant ability to project an astral form to travel great distances. She was often seen as weak by the other Acolytes, and she lacked the confidence that the others had. During the Fall of Avalon,\\"X-Men\\" vol. 2 #42-43 (July 1995) the Acolytes' space station, Scanner survived with teammates Unuscione, Cargill and the Kleinstocks by the help of Cyclops.

Subsequent appearances established her with the power to indefinitely project her astral form. She could manifest her astral form at a remote location, or travel vast distances very quickly. While in her astral state she could communicate with others telepathically and make her astral form visible to others as a ghost- like transparent copy of her actual body. While projecting, Scanner's real body remained unconscious. Additionally, Scanner could use her astral form to disrupt the astral forms of others upon contact, forcing them to return to their body. Later writers mistakenly wrote Scanner as transforming her body and clothing into an 'electro-transitional' state, similar to a living hologram, that was intangible and able to travel great distances at very fast speeds. While in this state she could communicate telepathically and was intangible to most forms of physical harm.

Plot introduction Trace is the thirteenth book of the Dr. Kay Scarpetta series by author Patricia Cornwell. Plot summary Dr. Kay Scarpetta, having left Richmond, Virginia five years ago to become a freelancer, is asked to return at the request of her replacement, Chief Medical Examiner Joel Marcus. A young girl has been murdered, but very few clues are available. In parallel her niece Lucy is investigating an attack on her companion Henri. Henri has been sent for analysis and safe keeping to stay with Benton Wesley, Scarpetta's partner. Scarpetta's investigations are hampered by Marcus's ineptness and the disarray of her former lab. Characters in \\"Trace\\" * Kay Scarpetta - Former Medical Examiner. * Benton Wesley - Profiler. * Lucy Farinelli - Kay's niece. * Pete Marino - Detective. Major themes * The hunt for the murderer of a young girl called Gilly Paulsson * The threat of a stalker targeting Lucy and her lover Literary significance & criticism This novel was considered to be an improvement over previous lacklustre installments by some reviewers.Review of Trace at The Mystery Reader Dale Singer of the St Louis Post Dispatch described the book as combining \\"sensitivity to human emotions with the latest in forensic techniques - and one of the creepiest villains to come along since \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\" Singer, D. 2004. Review of Trace. St Louis Post Dispatch Others, however, considered it to be repetitious and meandering,Harding, M. 2004. Review of Trace. The Book Reporter still not a full return to form. In Trace, one of Scarpetta's former employees, Edgar Allan Pogue, is discovered to be pursuing her niece, Lucy. Although diagnosed as \\"psychotic\\" by Benton Wesley, a criminal profiler, a number of chapters are narrated from his perspective which help to account for his behaviour.Dauncey, S. University of Warwick. \\"Patricia Cornwell.\\" The Literary Encyclopedia. 18 Nov. 2005. The Literary Dictionary Company. 22 April 2007. This change in narrative style from the first-person narration of Kay herself is one first seen in the previous work in the series, Blow Fly. This device not only allows for more characters and their perspectives to come to the fore, but also marks a significant transformation in the way that the novels represent the criminal. Where previously the criminal's mind was never made available to the reader ‚Äì thus intensifying their \\"otherness\\" ‚Äì the later novels allow space to explore their point of view and uncover their motivations. The writing crudely diminishes all those whom Scarpetta dislikes, leaving the reader little space for judgment. The third person brings out the self focussed contradictory mindset of many of the familiar characters. It is not clear whether this is intended by Cornwell. For example Scarpetta constantly is said to have been fired from her role as Chief Medical Examiner, yet her resignation is well set out in The Last Precinct, along with her internal satisfaction at resigning. In Trace she complains about not being told the building that once housed her office was being destroyed, yet in earlier books she constantly complained about its limitations. In a similar way Lucy, her niece, is derogatory about her neighbor for her house, reliance on security, interest in her neighbors - all traits equally applicable to Lucy. That the criminal is portrayed as driven by an insult by Lucy when a child a decade before the period of the book also goes to the series self focus - the various killers from Carrie Grethren to Chandonne and now to Pogue each come to target Scarpetta.

The game complements the release of Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, which is conversely available on Nintendo systems. Plot Tony Hawk, impressed with the player's town's undiscovered skate talent, announces the creation of a new skating team entitled 'Project 8', where eight of the town's best skateboarders will selected for the team. The player character starts ranked 200th and by completing challenges and goals, their ranking will improve constantly.http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/10/tony-hawks- project-8-review-2 Gameplay The sixth-generation ports of the game (PlayStation 2, Xbox) as well as the PlayStation Portable version utilize the engine of the previous installment Tony Hawk's American Wasteland and the games that proceeded it. However, the seventh-gen versions (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360) feature a completely new engine and gameplay to accommodate the more advanced hardware (While too released on the Xbox 360, American Wasteland remained largely the same on that console). For the seventh-generation versions, Project 8 features an open world, which contains various skate parks and hidden sections. The open world is linear and visibly connected, in contrast to the loading tunnels in American Wasteland. In the sixth-generation version, the levels are separate and have to be manually selected. There are 45 skaters in the game, including unlockable characters, who each have a unique mo-cap style, providing a different experience and no recycled animations. = New features = The game introduces the 'nail the trick' option. When a player enters this mode the camera will zoom in on the side to focus on the skateboard and the character's feet. Players are then able to use the right analog and left analog sticks to control the right and left feet, allowing the player to flip and rotate the board in any such manner; including tapping the underside of the board in the air and merging various techniques to form new moves. Another new ability in the game is to control the characters in the game during bails, allowing the player to obtain a high \\"Hospital bill\\", with bonus money awarded for broken bones‚Äîthis feature is used in numerous challenges across the story mode (on PS3 and Xbox 360). Players can also induce a bail manually. The option to walk, which was introduced in Tony Hawk's Underground, is retained.

Reception The game was met with mostly positive reviews upon release, with the Xbox 360 version garnering an overall average of 81% on GameRankings. It was especially the subject of praise for its \\"Nail the Trick\\" mode and graphical enhancements. It also received criticism for the removal of several key features.

She is regarded as an overachiever and perfectionist, but explains throughout the book that she finds it difficult being intellectually gifted, and uses her perfectionist behaviours as a coping mechanism to deal with problems with her family and with her insecurities regarding her friendships. Her immediate family consists of her mother Nell, a high-achieving lawyer and later judge, her father Victor, a teacher with a gentle nature, her older sister Jessica, who suffers with cystic acne and the discrimination that comes with it, and her older brother Charles, who was expelled from boarding school and makes their lives a misery. Rachel feels Charles gets all the attention in her family, even if it is negative, and that he is driving their parents to breaking point. She also resents that her brother gets so much attention from teenage girls, especially her friends, Stephanie and Alison. In the book, Rachel has to deal with her crush on Charles' tutor, Paul Medeiros, (who ends up dating their cousin Tarren), her worries that Stephanie and Alison prefer each other to her, her frequent invitations to join high-achieving school societies, and the fact that the best looking boy in ninth grade (at least, to Stephanie, Alison and Rachel), Jeremy \\"Dragon\\" Kravitz, may be interested in her.

Danzig paramilitaries and police, supported by Germany, immediately joined the offensive to take full control of the city, by capturing the Polish post office. Polish personnel defended the building for some 15 hours against assaults by the SS Heimwehr Danzig (SS Danzig Home Defence), local SA formations and special units of Danzig police. All but four of the defenders, who were able to escape from the building during the surrender, were sentenced to death by a German court martial as illegal combatants on October 5, 1939, and executed.  Prelude  The opening of the Polish Post Office \\"Gda≈Ñsk 3\\" in 1925 The Polish Post Office (Poczta Polska) in the Free City of Danzig was created in 1920 under the Treaty of Versailles, and its buildings were considered extraterritorial Polish property. The Polish Post Office in Danzig comprised several buildings. As tensions between Poland and Germany grew, in April 1939 the Polish High Command detached combat engineer and Army Reserve Sublieutenant (or 2LT) Konrad Guderski (1900-1939) to the Baltic Sea coast. With Alfons Flisykowski and others, he helped organise the official and volunteer security staff at the Polish Post Office in Danzig, and prepared them for possible hostilities. In addition to training the staff, he prepared the defences in and around the building: nearby trees were removed and the entrance was fortified. In mid-August, ten additional employees were sent to the post office from Polish Post offices in Gdynia and Bydgoszcz (mostly reserve non-commissioned officers). In the Polish Post Office complex on 1 September 1939 there were 56 people: Guderski, 42 local Polish employees, ten employees from Gdynia and Bydgoszcz, and the building caretaker with his wife and ten-year-old daughter, Erwina, who lived in the complex. The Polish employees had a cache of weapons, consisting of three Browning wz.1928 light machine guns, 40 other firearms and three chests of hand grenades. OBRO≈ÉCY POCZTY GDA≈ÉSKIEJ: CHWA≈ÅA I ZBRODNIA , Bogus≈Çaw Kubisz, M√≥wiƒÖ Wieki The Polish defence plan assigned the defenders the role of keeping Germans from the main building for six hours, when a relief force from Armia Pomorze was supposed to secure the area. The German attack plan, devised in July 1939, determined that the main building and its defenders would be stormed from two directions. A diversionary attack was to be carried out at the front entrance, while the main force would break through the wall from the neighbouring Work Office and attack from the side. Danzig Police also drew up plans for attacking the post office.Danzig: Der Kampf um die polnische Post  Battle  At 04:00 the Germans cut the phone and electricity lines to the building. At 04:45, just as the German battleship started shelling the nearby Polish Army military outpost at Westerplatte, the Danzig police began their assault on the building under the command of Polizeioberst Willi Bethke. They were soon reinforced by local SA formations and the SS units SS Wachsturmbann \\"E\\" and SS Heimwehr Danzig, supported by three police ADGZ heavy armoured cars. Albert Forster, head of the local Nazi party, arrived in one of the vehicles to watch the event. Journalists from local newspapers, Reichssender Danzig (the state radio station), and the newsreel company Ufa-Tonwache also came to cover the battle. Captured Polish postmen being led away under SS escort, while SA men and Danzig police look on The first German attack, from the front, was repelled, although some Germans managed to break through the entrance and briefly enter the building (at the cost of two killed and seven wounded attackers, including one group leader). The second attack, from the work office, was also repelled. The commander of the Polish defence, Konrad Guderski, died during the second attack from the blast of his own grenade, which stopped the Germans who had broken through the wall. With the Poles putting up more determined resistance than expected, Bethke suggested that his forces blow up the building with high explosives. Forster vetoed his proposal. At 11:00 German units were reinforced by the Wehrmacht with two 75 mm artillery pieces and a 105 mm howitzer, but the renewed assault, even with the artillery support, was again repulsed. Mortar support was requested from the German forces at Westerplatte, but its inaccurate fire posed a greater threat to the attackers and it soon ceased action. At 15:00, the Germans declared a two-hour ceasefire and demanded that the Polish forces surrender, which they refused. In the meantime, German sappers dug under the walls of the building and prepared a 600 kg explosive device. At 17:00, the bomb was set off, collapsing part of the wall, and German forces under the cover of three artillery pieces attacked again, this time capturing most of the building except the basement. Frustrated by the Poles' refusal to surrender, Bethke requested a rail car full of gasoline. Danzig's fire department pumped it into the basement, and it was then ignited by a hand grenade. After three Poles were burned alive (bringing the total Polish casualties to six killed in action), the rest decided to capitulate. The first one who left the building was the director Dr. Jan Micho≈Ñ. He was keeping white flag in hands but Germans just shot him. Next person commandant J√≥zef WƒÖsik was burned alive. The rest of the Poles were allowed to surrender and leave the burning building. Six people managed to escape from the building, although two of them were captured in the following days.  Aftermath  Sixteen wounded prisoners were sent to the Gestapo hospital, where six subsequently died (including the 10-year-old Erwina, who died due to burns several weeks later). The other 28 were first imprisoned in the police building and, after a few days, sent to the Victoriaschule, where they were interrogated and tortured.Dieter Schenk, Die Post von Danzig, page 80 Some 300 to 400 Polish citizens of Danzig were also held there. = Courts martial = All the prisoners were put on trial in front of the martial court of the Wehrmacht's Gruppe Eberhardt. A first group of 28 Victoriaschule prisoners, with a single Wehrmacht officer as defence lawyer,Dieter Schenk, Die Post von Danzig, page 96 was tried on 8 September, a second group of 10, who recovered in the hospital, on 30 September. All were sentenced to death as illegal combatants under the German special military penal law of 1938. The sentence was demanded by the prosecutor Hans Giesecke and declared by presiding judge , vice-president of the Oberlandesgericht Danzig (Higher Regional Court of Danzig). Twenty-eight of the judgements were countersigned, and thus became legally valid, by General Hans G√ºnther von Kluge, the further 10 by Colonel Eduard Wagner, who later committed suicide on 23 July 1944 as a member of the 20 July plot.Dieter Schenk, Die Post von Danzig, page 103 A clemency appeal was rejected by General Walther von Brauchitsch.Dieter Schenk, Die Post von Danzig, page 106 The prisoners were mostly executed by firing squad led by SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Max Pauly (later commandant of the Neuengamme concentration camp) on 5 October and buried in a mass grave at the cemetery of Danzig-Saspe (Zaspa). One, Leon Fuz, was later recognized and murdered in the Stutthof concentration camp in November. Four defenders who managed to escape and hide survived the war. The families of the postmen were also persecuted. A similar fate awaited eleven Polish railway workers from Tczew south of the city, who were executed by the SA after they foiled a German attempt to use an armoured train in a sneak attack. Giesecke and Bode were never held responsible for this episode or held accountable for the executions. They were denazified after the war and continued their careers as lawyers in Germany. Both died of natural causes in the 1970s. Only in 1997‚Äì1998 did the German court at L√ºbeck (the Gro√üe Strafkammer IIb and the Dritte Gro√üe Strafkammer) invalidate the 1939 Nazi sentence, citing among the reasons that the special military penal law had only taken effect in Danzig on November 16, 1939 and charged the presiding judge with negligence of his duties.Kriegsverbrechen in Europa und im Nahen Osten im 20. Jahrhundert, Franz W. Seidler/ Alfred M. de Zayas (Hrsg.), Hamburg: Mittler 2002, Seite 138 The decision of the German court occurred thanks to the work of a German author, Dieter Schenk, who published a monograph on the defence of the post office and referred to the execution of the defenders as judicial murder (Justizmord).Andrzej Gasiorowski in Chrzanowski, et al. Polska Podziemna na Pomorzu w Latach 1939-1945 (Polish Underground State in Pomerania in the years 1939-1945), Oskar, Gdansk, 2005, pg. 50 Schenk stresses the commanding role of Danzig police forces, which made a Wehrmacht court martial not competent to convict the defenders. Instead, the Free City of Danzig's penal law would have been applicable, without the option of a death penalty. = Cultural legacy = Monument to the Defenders of the Polish Post Office, Gda≈Ñsk In Poland, the episode has become one of the better known episodes of the Polish September Campaign and it is usually portrayed as a heroic story of David and Goliath proportions. In this view, it was a group of postmen who held out against German SS troops for almost an entire day. In 1979, the Defenders of the Polish Post Office monument was unveiled in Gda≈Ñsk. The Polish defence of the post office was also sympathetically portrayed in Chapter 18 of The Tin Drum by G√ºnter Grass, 'The Defence of the Polish Post Office'. In the chapter, the protagonist Oskar Matzerath meets his presumptive father Jan Bronski as the latter heads home, trying to avoid fighting in the looming battle. Upon meeting Oskar, Jan returns to the post office, taking Oskar with him. Oskar is present during the siege, and portrays his presumptive father negatively to the SS, leading him to find himself guilty of Jan's execution. In the novel's penultimate chapter, Oskar and his friend Vittlar after the war encounter in D√ºsseldorf a survivor of the siege, Viktor Weluhn, whom two men were preparing to execute for his actions at the siege. Viktor and his executioners disappear into the night later in the chapter, with Viktor's fate left unknown. The defence of the post office is dramatised in the first episode of World on Fire  See also  *Battle of Westerplatte *The Tin Drum and The Tin Drum (film)  References   Further reading  *G√ºnter Grass Die Blechtrommel (The Tin Drum), 1959 * Adam Bartoszewski, Wies≈Çaw Gomulski, ≈ªolnierze w pocztowych mundurach (Soldiers in the Postal Uniforms), 1969 * Dieter Schenk 'Die Post von Danzig.

The film is the Tamil remake of the Hindi film Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.. It stars Kamal Haasan, Prabhu, Sneha, and Prakash Raj, in the lead roles, while Nagesh, Rohini Hattangadi, Jayasurya, Malavika, Crazy Mohan and Karunas, among others, play supporting roles. The film's music was composed by Bharadwaj.  Plot  Rajaraman, nicknamed \\"Vasool Raja\\", is a local don in Chennai who makes a living by collecting money from people who refuse or dilly-dally in paying their debts to others, with the help of his right-hand man Vatti. Given that his father Sriman Venkataraman had wished him to be a doctor, he creates the faux Venkataraman Charitable Hospital. which is named after his father and pretends to live in accordance with this wish whenever his father and mother Kasturi visit him in Chennai. One year later, Raja's plan goes awry when Venkataraman meets an old acquaintance, Dr. Vishwanathan. The two men decide to get Raja married to Vishwanathan's daughter Dr. Janaki aka \\"Paapu\\", who was a childhood friend of Raja under that name. At this point, the truth about Raja is revealed. Vishwanathan insults Raja's parents and calls them \\"fools\\" for being ignorant of Raja's real life. Venkataraman and Kasturi, who are both aghast and heartbroken, leave Raja for their village. Raja, in grief and despair, decides that the only way to redeem himself and gain revenge for the humiliation suffered by his father at the hands of the spiteful Vishwanathan is to become a doctor. He goes to a medical college to obtain an MBBS degree, the graduate medical degree in South Asia. With the help of Vatti and others, Raja gains admission to the SLR Institute of Medical Sciences by threatening Dr. Margabandhu, who is a faculty member of the college, where he again encounters Vishwanathan, who is the college dean. His success there becomes dependent upon the coerced help of Margabandhu. While Raja's skills as a medical doctor are minimal, he transforms those around him with the \\"Kattipudi Vaithiyam\\" (\\"hugging therapy\\"), a method of comfort taught to Raja by his mother, and the compassion he shows towards those in need. Despite the school's emphasis on mechanical, Cartesian, impersonal, often bureaucratic relationships between doctors and patients, Raja constantly seeks to impose a more empathetic, almost holistic, regimen. To this end, he defies all convention by treating a brain-dead man as if the man were able to perceive and understand normally; intimidating Dr. Kalidas into admitting and treating a suicide patient named Neelakandan; interacting on familiar but autocratic terms with patients; humiliating school bullies; effusively thanking a hitherto-underappreciated cleaner; helping a terminally ill cancer patient named Zakir; and encouraging the patients themselves to make changes in their lives so that they do not need pharmaceuticals or surgery. Vishwanathan, who perceives all this as symptoms of chaos, is unable to prevent it from expanding and gaining ground at his college. He becomes increasingly irritable, almost to the point of insanity. Repeatedly, this near-dementia is shown when he receives unwelcome tidings and begins laughing in a way that implies that he has gone mad. This behavior is explained early on as an attempt to practice laughter therapy, an attempt that seems to have backfired. Vishwanathan's laughing serves more to convey his anger than diffuse it. Meanwhile, Janaki becomes increasingly fond of Raja, who, in his turn, becomes unreservedly infatuated with her. Some comedy appears here because Raja is unaware that Janaki and his childhood friend \\"Paapu\\" are one and the same; an ignorance that Janaki hilariously exploits. Vishwanathan tries several times to expel Raja, but is often thwarted by Raja's wit or the affection with which the others at the college regard Raja, having gained superior self-esteem by his methods. Eventually, Raja is shamed into leaving the college: His guilt for not being able to help Zakir gets the better of him. In the moments immediately following Raja's departure, the bedridden man miraculously awakens from his vegetative state; at this point, Janaki gives a heartfelt speech wherein she criticizes her father for having banished Raja, saying that to do so is to banish hope, compassion, love, happiness, etc. from the college. Vishwanathan eventually realizes his folly. Raja later marries Janaki, learning for the first time that she is \\"Paapu\\", while also reconciling with his parents.

He spent most of his life at sea, first in the British Royal Navy, and then sailing in small yachts for various purposes, including self-appointed adventure trips. Starting in 1977, he wrote sixteen books and many articles about sailing and his adventures, including several memoirs. His writing, while highly entertaining, often mixes fact and fiction. In his memoirs, he invented a fictional childhood and youth. Early life Tristan Jones, whose real name was Arthur Jones, was born in 1929 in Liverpool. He was the illegitimate son of a working-class girl, and was brought up mainly in orphanages, with little real education. He joined the Royal Navy in 1946, after the end of World War II, and served for 14 years. Then he bought a sailboat, tried whiskey smuggling, and scraped a living sailing the Mediterranean Sea. He taught himself to write, and sold articles to yachting magazines. The Incredible Voyage In the early 1970s, he conceived the idea of setting \\"the altitude record for sailing\\" by sailing both the Dead Sea (the lowest open water in the world) and Lake Titicaca, which is 3,812 meters (12,507 ft) up in the Andes Mountains. He sailed to Israel, and trucked his sailboat to the Dead Sea. Though he was not allowed to launch his boat, he did make a brief sail on the Sea in an Israeli naval officer's sailboat. He then sailed his boat from Israel around Africa to the West Indies, where he traded it for a smaller boat. He sailed this boat to Peru, trucked it up to Lake Titicaca, and sailed the lake, thus achieving the \\"record\\". He then hauled his sailboat across Bolivia to Brazil on the Paraguay River, and sailed down through the Mato Grosso to Paraguay and Argentina. His account of this adventure was published in 1977 as his first book, The Incredible Voyage. Writing career and \\"reinvention\\" Jones wrote The Incredible Voyage while living in Greenwich Village in New York City. It was a success, and he soon wrote several more books. According to Anthony Dalton's account, \\"Then came a midlife sea change. Arthur Jones looked into his future, imagined greatness, and began to claw his way to it. Having taught himself to sail, he taught himself to write. He was a natural at both. As Tristan Jones, in his mid-forties, he sailed out of Brazil's Mato Grosso and into a Greenwich Village apartment to write six books in three years and reinvent his past.\\" In his imagined past, he was born at sea, on his father's tramp freighter off Tristan da Cunha in 1924 (thus the name \\"Tristan\\"), left school at 14 to work on sailing barges (A Steady Trade), and served as a boy seaman in the Royal Navy during World War II (Heart of Oak). While his account of war service is entertaining, Jones has been compared to a 'rum gagger' (19th century British slang for a man who got money or drinks by telling fraudulent tales of supposed suffering at sea). Besides the two volumes of autobiography, he wrote five volumes of entertaining (if unreliable) memoirs of his sailing adventures: Ice! (1978), Saga of a Wayward Sailor (1979), Dutch Treat (1979), Adrift (1980), and Aka (1981). \\"Tristan\\" Jones became a noted personality in the sailing community. In 1982, he published One Hand for Yourself, One for the Ship: The Essentials of Single Handed Sailing. Later life His left leg was amputated in 1982, due to health problems and accidents. Despite this, he resumed sailing, to inspire other people with disabilities. He sailed the trimaran Outward Leg from San Diego to London by way of Colombia, Panama, and New York City; the story of this voyage was told in his book Outward Leg. He then continued across central Europe by river and canal to the Black Sea, as told in The Improbable Voyage, and then around southern Asia to Thailand, as recounted in Somewheres East of Suez. In 1991, he also lost his right leg, and became depressed, although he returned briefly to sea. He settled in Phuket, Thailand, converted to Islam, and took the name 'Ali'. Though he seems not to have informed all his older friends of this, he signed his name as 'Ali' in correspondence with Rafiq A. Tschannen, a Swiss Muslim living in Bangkok. The change is also confirmed in Dalton's biography. Films about Tristan Jones * Tristan Jones: the Psychology of Adventure (1990) * The Incredible Tristan Jones (1990) A few years after his voyage from San Diego to Thailand, Jones visited New York, and spoke about his travels at the New York Open Center. This talk was recorded, and has been released as a videotape and DVD, titled Tristan Jones: the Psychology of Adventure. Later, the producers of The Psychology of Adventure sat down with Jones at a pub in Greenwich Village for a videotaped interview, which became The Incredible Tristan Jones.

They are a student-run, all-male a cappella group at the University of Virginia. The group was founded in 1987 by Halsted Sullivan and recorded its 19th studio album in 2014. They have appeared as the fictional group \\"Here Comes Treble\\" on an episode of NBC's The Office, performed at the 2004 Republican National Convention, Washington Nationals baseball games, Good Morning America, the Philippines, weddings, and private parties. Other performance requests have included invitations from the White House, the Kennedy Center, and NBC's The Today Show. History Originally friends, the group was founded on December 8, 1987 at the University of Virginia. They don't use instruments and wear robes while performing. The group's history has taken them around the world and allowed them to record several studio albums in what they refer to on their album inserts as \\"Hullabasound\\". The Hullabahoos typically have 13 to 18 members, although this figure varies from year to year. Auditions for newcomers are held every fall and occasionally in the spring. The Hullabahoos logo The current Hullabahoos logo was drawn in fall 2003 by Morgan Anderson, a student at Williams College, to promote the Hullabahoos' visit to her college. The poster was later scanned into a computer and emailed from a girlfriend in Massachusetts to her boyfriend in Virginia, and it slowly crept its way on to more and more Hullabahoos' paraphernalia, gradually overtaking the traditional but less distinctive Uppercase H logo. = Fall Roll = In addition to concert performances and other similar gigs, the Hullabahoos typically reserve their fall break weekend at the University of Virginia for a road trip known as Fall Roll. The tour typically covers the East Coast, stopping and performing at various colleges (e.g. Dartmouth College, Boston University, University of Connecticut) along the way. = CD production = The Hullabahoos released their first studio album, Full Glottal Stop, in 1991, and spent the majority of their early album-making career recording with the accomplished sound engineer Paul Brier, formerly of Virginia Arts Recording Studios in Charlottesville, Virginia. However, with the release in 2004 of Jacked, the Hullabahoos began to use to a new sound engineer/producer, Dave Sperandio of Diovoce, hiring him to handle the album's final mixes and mastering. Sperandio, with his proficiency in hip-hop and pop type production, quickly built a solid reputation in the a cappella world, and his work has been commended by the Recorded A Cappella Review Board (RARB). With the Hullabahoos' 13th CD release, the a cappella producer and UVA alumnus, James Gammon, of James Gammon Productions, was added to the production team, doing almost all of the Hullabahoos' recording as well as mixing \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\" and recording and mixing the album Varsity Sing Team in full. = Robes = The Hullabahoos of 2000-2001, wearing their robes The Hullabahoos were not the first all-male a cappella group at the University of Virginia. The Virginia Gentlemen were founded in 1953. Historically, the Virginia Gentlemen wear tuxedos or coats and bowties whenever they perform. When the Hullabahoos were formed, they decided to differentiate themselves with a more laid-back style by adopting the use of uniquely patterned robes that have been noted to resemble the official garb of the Eli Banana, one of the many Secret Societies at the University of Virginia. Each member goes to Mr. Hank's Fabric Store in Charlottesville to pick out his own desired robe pattern. This gives the group a sense of relaxed individuality, making the Hullabahoos stand out amongst the more typical glee club-style college groups.  Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate A Cappella Glory  New York-based writer Mickey Rapkin followed the Hullabahoos in 2006 and 2007 and profiled the group in his book, Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate A Cappella Glory. This \\"behind-the-scenes look at the bizarre, inspiring, and hilarious world of competitive collegiate a cappella\\" was published on May 29, 2008, by Gotham Books. The group makes an appearance in the film adaptation, Pitch Perfect, released in 2012. They appear during the ICCA Finals as a participating group performing \\"The Final Countdown\\".

At the age of 20, Sarphati started studying medicine in Leiden, which he finished with a promotion in 1839. During his work thereafter as a doctor in Amsterdam (he lived at the house #598 Herengracht), Sarphati encountered the bad hygiene among the poor in Amsterdam. His compassion for his patients led him to initiate several projects to improve the quality of life in the city and the health of its inhabitants.\\"Samuel Sarphati\\", Radio Netherlands Archives, May 14, 2003 This included a bread factory producing wholesome, affordable bread, and a refuse collection service. Sarphati played an important role in the initiation of waste transport in 1847. He became involved in politics, particularly as a project developer in city planning. Beside public health, he initiated improvements in education and industrialization. He wanted to enhance Amsterdam's dignity and standing by constructing impressive buildings like the Amstel Hotel and the Paleis voor Volksvlijt. in the Sarphati park, Amsterdam After his death, Sarphatipark in Amsterdam was designed and named after him in 1885.

Its spectrum is described as having a non-photospheric continuum and silicon absorption lines, indicative of high mass loss. V399 Carinae has long been suspected to be variable. A 1981 study of yellow supergiants fit observations to a Cepheid-like light curve with a period of 58.8 days, although the luminosity and spectral type do not place the star near the Cepheid instability strip. It was listed in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars as a possible Œ¥ Cep variable. Further observations refined the period to 47.25 days. The Hipparcos catalogue classified V399 Car as a semiregular variable with a period of 88 days and a mean amplitude of only 0.04 magnitudes. An automated classification from Hipparos photometry suggested it is an Œ± Cygni variable. The observed brightness varies from magnitude +4.63 to +4.72.

It was historically used as a surgical antiseptic. More recently zinc peroxide has also been used as an oxidant in explosives and pyrotechnic mixtures. Its properties have been described as a transition between ionic and covalent peroxides. Zinc peroxide can be synthesized through the reaction of zinc chloride and hydrogen peroxide. Preparation Zinc hydroxide is reacted with a mixture of hydrochloric acid and hydrogen peroxide and precipitated with sodium hydroxide also containing hydrogen peroxide to ensure a higher yield of zinc peroxide. Unlike in the preparation of copper peroxide, the zinc ion does not cause the peroxide to decompose. Applications Since the 1930s zinc peroxide has been applied in a variety of settings, from medicine to aesthetics and even fireworks. =Medical Use= The treatment of burrowing ulcers in the abdominal wall with zinc peroxide was first recorded in 1933 and throughout the 1940s ZnO2 was used as a disinfectant in surgical infections. Zinc peroxide was, however, deemed ineffective against certain bacterial strains, such as Streptococcus viridans, staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, B. proteus, and B. pyocyoneus. One aspect of the compound‚Äôs microorganism toxicity is the resultant stagnation of microbial populations upon administration. This effect was hypothesized to depend upon the compound‚Äôs penchant for oxygen donation. It has been suggested that the increase in oxygen concentration associated with the presence of ZnO2 interferes with the replicative processes of anaerobic and micro-aerophillic organisms, both of which require low oxygen environments for their survival. While this mechanism was sufficient to explain the stagnation of microbe populations, it did not account for the active reduction in colony size. As to the microbicidal function, the Zinc ion itself has been postulated to have antibacterial properties, facilitated by the binding of the Zn ion to the bacterial cell wall, which allows for the exertion of cytotoxic effects. Zinc has been observed to be more effective in the elimination of gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria. This difference has been attributed to a difference in the protein composition of the respective cell walls, with the gram-positive wall providing a composition more conducive to binding. =Mineral stain= Recently the compound has found use as a mineral stain for wood and other substances. The mechanism of this action involves the application of a metal salt (such as iron(II) chloride) and the zinc peroxide to the substrate material (wood or wood-like material, i.e. bamboo, paper, cloths, and cellulose products). The metal salt is applied in solution and allowed to dry for up to 30 minutes. Next, zinc peroxide is applied, also in solution. Color change is immediately visible. The two solutions soak into the material, and react, thereby becoming ingrained in the matrix of the substrate. While these stains can produce a variety of colors ranging from a reddish brown to a yellow hue, they are generally used to mimic the look of endangered wood species in cheaper and more commonly available stock. =Pyrotechnics= In the 1980s the discovery of zinc peroxide‚Äôs ability to complement pyrotechnical mixtures was discovered. It was noted that ZnO2 was preferable to the usage of barium compounds, as it was deemed to be less toxic. The zinc compound proves an effective component in explosives because of its oxidizing properties. Many chemical explosives rely on rapid oxidation reactions, for this reason ZnO2 is an ideal candidate for use in pyrotechnics. Another advantage of ZnO2 was, as compared to the barium and strontium pyroingredients, it effects less corrosion in the metallic materials which contain the compounds in the pyrotechnic instrument. In one modality it is necessary for zinc peroxide to act in conjunction with a reducer like calcium silicide, to create the necessary red/ox reaction. In another modality, a ‚Äòsecondary‚Äô explosive is mixed with zinc peroxide. Secondary explosives include nitrocellulose, pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), as well as a variety of compounds, like trinitrobenzene, which provide powerful negative charge balance. These secondary explosives are relatively insensitive to stimuli such as physical impact, heat or charge. The explosive mixture would be comprised, in bulk, of the secondary explosive with a much smaller fraction of zinc peroxide, present to initiate the reaction. Safety Zinc peroxide is very hazardous in case of skin contact, of eye contact, ingestion, or inhalation. It has been shown to be corrosive to skin. Prolonged exposure may result in skin burns and ulcerations. Over-exposure by inhalation may cause respiratory irritation. Skin inflammation is characterized by itching, scaling, reddening, or, occasionally, blistering. Zinc peroxide is toxic to lungs and mucous membranes. Repeated or prolonged exposure can produce organ damage. Repeated or prolonged inhalation of vapors may lead to chronic respiratory irritation.

It tells the story of a young man, Kirth Gersen, who sets out to track down and revenge himself upon the first of the Demon Princes, the five arch-criminals who massacred or enslaved nearly all the inhabitants of his colony world when he was a child. Star King was originally serialized in the December 1963 and February 1964 editions of Galaxy magazine, as The Star King. The antagonist of the book was originally known as Grendel the Monster, and was subsequently renamed Attel Malagate for the novel version. The magazine version featured striking cover and interior illustrations by Ed Emshwiller. Though Vance won the 1963 short-story Hugo award for \\"The Dragon Masters\\", Star King did not win the award as is half-suggested by early cover designs. Plot summary Gersen is taking a short holiday at Smade's Tavern, the only settlement on Smade's Planet, which is a ‚Äúneutral ground‚Äù hostelry for crook and honest man alike in the Beyond. Here he meets an explorer with a problem: Lugo Teehalt has discovered a beautiful and unspoiled world ‚Äì but he has learned that his employer is the notorious criminal Attel Malagate, ‚ÄúMalagate the Woe‚Äù, and Teehalt cannot bear to see his planet despoiled by him. However, some of Malagate's minions murder him and steal the spaceship parked nearby. By chance, Gersen's spaceship is the same common model as Teehalt's; the thieves have taken the wrong ship. Gersen departs in the deceased man's ship and thus comes into possession of the navigational device that contains the planet's coordinates. Gersen goes in search of the identity of Teehalt's employer. He quickly establishes that his mission was sponsored by someone at Sea Province University, an important institution on the planet Alphanor in the Rigel Concourse, and narrows Malagate's alter ego to one of three men, all senior officials at the university. All deny specific knowledge of Lugo Teehalt. By now, Gersen has encountered two of Malagate's chief henchmen, whom he saw earlier at Smade's Tavern: Tristano the Earthman, and Sivij Suthiro the Sarkoy. He knows that Malagate is aware of what he carries, though not his motivation. He has also deduced that Malagate is not, as widely assumed, human, but rather a \\"Star King\\", a member of a species that can rapidly evolve in a few generations to resemble its most successful rival. After contacting humans, the Star Kings began changing their appearance to look more and more like Man. The most successful can readily pass for human. During his visit to the University, Gersen makes the acquaintance of Pallis Atwrode, a clerical assistant. While the two are enjoying an evening out, they are attacked by another of Malagate's lieutenants, the hideous Hildemar Dasce. Gersen is left unconscious and Pallis abducted. Through a combination of detective work and good luck, he traces her whereabouts to a secret base belonging to Dasce. He takes the three officials to see Teehalt's world, which they are interested in purchasing, and along the way, Gersen opportunely stops to rescue Pallis and capture Dasce, along with a prisoner Dasce has tortured for years, Robin Rampold. Gersen convinces Dasce that Malagate betrayed him and then allows Dasce to overpower him. Dasce's attempt to avenge himself on Malagate reveals the Star King's identity. In combination with strong circumstantial evidence, this convinces the other two men to accept Gersen's accusations. After Dasce's unsuccessful attack and flight, Gersen tells Malagate that he is to be summarily executed. Malagate however succeeds in escaping himself, only to be horribly killed a few minutes later by one of the native lifeforms on Teehalt's world. At his own request, Rampold is left behind. He subsequently turns the tables on his former torturer and begins a long-term program of revenge.

Reputation makes him the most callous of the arch-criminals and he has no qualms about killing the recalcitrant Lugo Teehalt, and does nothing when Gersen captures his trusted lieutenant, Hildemar Dasce. An outcast from Star King society, Malagate has the comparatively reasonable life goal (compared to the rest of the Demon Princes) of founding a people of his own on the new world that Teehalt has discovered. =Hildemar Dasce= Malagate's hideous lieutenant, nicknamed \\"Beauty\\", whose natural charms weren't improved when, sometime in the past, Robin Rampold cruelly cut off his eyelids and cleft his nose. He refuses to have his features mended and instead accentuates his ugliness with outlandish skin-tones. Calling himself ‚ÄúMr. Spock\\" he maintains a secret hideaway called ‚ÄúThumbnail Gulch‚Äù on a dead black star, a close binary companion to a red dwarf. There he imprisons Rampold, subjecting him to many years of intermittent tortures both physical and psychological for revenge. =Sivij Suthiro= A master Sarkoy poisoner, the second of Malagate's henchmen and referred to as a hetman (presumably a Sarkoy title or rank). He, Dasce and Tristano the Earthman deal with Teehalt. Later he crosses Gersen's path on three occasions; ironically, Gersen poisons him with cluthe on their second meeting and informs Suthiro that he is a dying man on the last occasion, though in the end he is obliged to shoot him. By his own lights, Suthiro is not especially wicked; \\"I kill only when I must or when it profits me\\", he explains, and by Sarkoy standards, this may indeed make him a model of restraint. =Tristano the Earthman= Malagate's third underling is a shortish, but powerfully built man who specializes in unarmed combat - it is said that \\"he kills with touches of his hand\\". However, he is no match for Gersen. When they meet, Tristano is seriously injured, but not killed, and plays no part in the plot afterwards. =Smade= The builder and proprietor of Smade's Tavern, the only settlement on the bleak Smade's Planet. Smade insists on peace inside his tavern, with any transgressors being pitched into the sea from the nearby cliff. The murder of Teehalt on his premises angers him, inasmuch as the deed could as well have been perpetrated outside. Otherwise, Smade lives contentedly in a polygamous marriage with many offspring, calmly accepting that his clientele includes some of the galaxy's most notorious criminals. Star Kings The Star Kings are an asexual alien species whose highly successful strategy is to evolve at a furious rate to become like their most successful competitors. According to Kirth Gersen, their development on their homeworld, which they call \\"Ghnarumen\\" (Lambda Gruis III), was profoundly influenced by the artificial introduction of Neanderthal men in prehistory. In the ensuing millennia, Neanderthals proved to be the fittest species, so the Star Kings grew first to resemble them, then to outcompete and eventually exterminate them from Ghnarumen. Thus, when the Star Kings later came in contact with spacefaring humanity, they immediately began to imitate homo sapiens, driven by their age-old instinct to excel and outdo. Their temperament and motivations are far different from those of humans, but the most highly evolved (that is, the most human) are able to venture into human society without notice. However, Malagate is an atypical Star King. A notorious criminal with an outstanding reputation for callousness, he himself states shortly before his death that his career is not one that his kind would respect or endorse.

It is located on the southern edge of the Great Karoo, at the foot of the Swartberg mountains.  History  Prince Albert was founded in 1762Fitzpatrick, Mary et al. South Africa, Lesotho & Swaziland, Lonely Planet, 2006, , p. 228 on a farm called Queekvalleij that had been on loan to Zacharias and Dina de Beer since 1762The Great Karoo.com, Prince Albert Tourism Info, available URL:http://www.thegreatkaroo.com/listings/tourism_info/western_cape/great_karoo/prince_albert, accessed: 11 February 2015 Originally known as Albertsburg, when it obtained municipal status in 1845 it was renamed Prince Albert in honour of Queen Victoria's consort, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg. Prince Albert was historically part of the Cape Colony. During the latter part of the century, a nugget of gold was discovered on a farm in the area. Due to the fact that a similar occurrence had led to the Gold Rush in the Witwatersrand, this new discovery precipitated a similar population boom. However, the prosperity up North was not to be shared in Prince Albert and the gold mined turned out to be minimal. Prince Albert became a British garrison during the Second Boer War in 1899. The town was the site of several clashes between the British and the Boers during this period.  Climate  Prince Albert has a temperate climate with high temperatures in summer, with an average of 33‚Äì35 ¬∞C, and 17 ¬∞C in the winter months. Winter is mainly sunny with colder temperatures and chilly nights, reaching midwinter minimums of 2 ¬∞C, with frost in places and some snow on the nearby Swartberg mountains.  Economy  The town has a GINI coefficient of 0.56 making it more economically equal than the South African average of 0.63 and a Human Development Index of 0.68 which was slightly lower than the South African average of 0.705. Around 20% of the town's working age population is unemployed which is lower than the South African average unemployment rate of 29%. The total size of the town's GDPR in 2015 was R418 million (roughly equivalent to US$34.3 million). The three largest economic sectors by value in the town's economy being government services (21%), agriculture (19%), and retail and tourism (15%). Agriculture provides about one third of all jobs in the town with retail and tourism being the second largest employer by sector accounting for 18% of all jobs provided.  Points of interest  The Dutch Reformed Church in Prince Albert is a central feature of the town.Prince Albert has a small local population, mainly engaged in farming and tourism. The village has many authentic Cape Dutch, Karoo and Victorian buildings, thirteen of which are National Monuments. There are several olive farms and other very large export fruit farms in the area, as well as wine producers, sheep farms and an export mohair trade. Birding, hiking, cycling and stargazing are other pursuits for visitors. The area is well known for its endemic veld plants.

The three students all white were David Evans, Collin Finnerty, and Reade Seligmann. The accuser was Crystal Mangum, a black student at North Carolina Central University who worked as a stripper and dancer. The rape was alleged to have occurred at a party hosted by the lacrosse team, held at the Durham residence of two of the team's captains on March 13, 2006. The case's resolution sparked public discussion of racism, sexual violence, media bias, and due process on campuses, and ultimately led to the resignation and disbarment of the lead prosecutor, Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong. On April 11, 2007, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper dropped all charges, declaring the three lacrosse players \\"innocent\\" and victims of a \\"tragic rush to accuse\\". Nifong, who was labeled a \\"rogue prosecutor\\" by Cooper, withdrew from the case in January 2007 after the North Carolina State Bar filed ethics charges against him. In June 2007, Nifong was disbarred for \\"dishonesty, fraud, deceit and misrepresentation\\", making him the first prosecutor in North Carolina disbarred for trial conduct. Nifong served one day in jail for lying about sharing DNA tests (criminal contempt); the lab director said it was a misunderstanding and Nifong claimed it was due to weak memory. Mangum maintained her insistence that she was sexually assaulted that night. She faced no charges. Cooper noted several inconsistencies between Mangum's accounts of the evening, and Seligmann and Finnerty's alibi evidence. The Durham Police Department came under fire for violating their own policies by allowing Nifong to act as the de facto head of the investigation; using an unreliable suspect-only photo identification procedure with Mangum; pursuing the case despite vast discrepancies in notes taken by Investigator Benjamin Himan and Sgt. Mark Gottlieb; and distributing a poster presuming the suspects' guilt shortly after the allegations. Seligmann, Finnerty, and Evans sought unspecified damages and called for criminal justice reform laws in a federal civil rights lawsuit against the City of Durham. Timeline of events =Events at the house= The house at 610 North Buchanan Boulevard (demolished in July 2010) In March 2006, Crystal Gail Mangum,Mangum, Crystal G. , North Carolina Department of Correction Public Access Information System a student at North Carolina Central University,\\"Crystal Gail Mangum: Profile of the Duke Rape Accuser\\" , Fox News, April 11, 2007. had been working part- time for about two months as a stripper. Although Mangum claimed that she had only recently taken up stripping, she had actually worked at strip clubs as early as 2002: when she was arrested that year for stealing a taxi and trying to run over a police officer, the incident report stated that she had been lap dancing at a strip club that evening. On March 13, 2006, a party was held at 610 North Buchanan Boulevard, a house owned by Duke University and used as the off-campus residence of the Duke lacrosse team captains. The party was intended as compensation for the team having to remain on campus and miss Spring Break. The players were consuming alcohol at the party. Several players did not know that strippers were being hired until the players arrived at the party and were asked to contribute to the strippers' fees.Parrish, R. B. (2009) The Duke Lacrosse Case: A Documentary History and Analysis of the Modern Scottsboro, p. 19; A team captain contacted Allure, an escort service, and requested two white strippers. However, the two women who arrived, Mangum and Kim Mera Roberts (aka Kim Mera Pittman), were respectively black and biracial (half-black/half-Asian). Before arriving at the party, Mangum, by her own admission, had consumed alcohol and Flexeril (a prescription muscle relaxant).Until Proven Innocent, pg. 33 Mangum and Roberts traveled to the party separately. Roberts drove herself and arrived first, and Mangum was later dropped off by a man. According to the team captains, one player asked if the strippers had any sex toys, and Roberts responded by asking if the player's penis was too small. The player then brandished a broomstick and suggested that she \\"use this [as a sex toy]\\". This exchange of words abruptly stopped the performance, and both strippers shut themselves in the home's bathroom. While the women were still in the bathroom, players Reade Seligmann and Collin Finnerty left the house. The women eventually came out, and Mangum roamed around the yard half-dressed and shouting. According to Mangum, the women were coaxed back into the house with an apology, at which point they were separated. She asserts she was then dragged into a bathroom and raped, beaten, and choked for a half hour. Later, police received a 9-1-1 call from a woman complaining that white men gathered outside the home where the party took place had called her racial slurs and threatened to sodomize her with a broomstick. Some of the party attendees expressed displeasure that the strippers had delivered a very short performance despite being paid several hundred dollars apiece to perform. The team captain who had hired the strippers tried to convince the women to come back into the house and complete the performance. Both women came back into the house, but upon being approached by the player who had earlier held up the broomstick, again refused to perform and locked themselves in the bathroom. By this point, a number of the party guests had left, and the residents of the house, including player David Evans, were asking the remaining guests to leave because they were concerned that the noise would cause neighbors to complain to police. When the strippers left the bathroom and the house for the second time, a resident locked the door so they (and the guests who had left the house) could not get back in. Shortly before 1 a.m., Mangum and Roberts entered Roberts's vehicle. Roberts called the partygoers \\"short dick white boys\\", and jeered at a player about \\"how he couldn't get it on his own and had to pay for it\\", to which one player yelled, \\"We asked for whites, not niggers.\\" Mangum and Roberts departed in Roberts's car. Roberts then called 9-1-1 and reported that she had just come from 610 North Buchanan and a \\"white guy\\" had yelled \\"nigger\\" at her from near the East Campus wall. The party ended shortly thereafter and everyone, including the residents, left the house. Police later went to the house as a result of Roberts's complaint, but got no answer at the door; a neighbor confirmed that a party held earlier had ended. =After departure= As Roberts drove away with Mangum, the two women began to argue. Roberts stopped the car and attempted to push Mangum out.\\"'Go Ahead, Put Marks on Me'\\" , abcnews.go.com, October 30, 2006. When that failed, Roberts drove Mangum to a nearby Kroger supermarket, went inside, and told a female security guard that a woman was refusing to leave her car. The guard walked to the car and asked Mangum to leave, but Mangum remained in the vehicle. The guard later said she had not smelled alcohol on Mangum's breath, but thought she might have been under the influence of other drugs. At 1:22 AM, the guard called 9-1-1 to report that Mangum refused to leave the car. Police then arrived, removed Mangum from the car and questioned her.Cuomo, Chris & Lara Setrakian, \\"Exclusive: Guard Who Saw Alleged Duke Victim Says No Sign or Mention of Rape\\" ABC News, April 17, 2006. As Mangum had no identification, would not talk to police, was having difficulty walking, and seemed severely impaired, police took her to Durham Center Access, a mental-health and substance-abuse facility, for involuntary commitment. During the admission process, she claimed that she had been raped prior to her arrival.\\"Defense motion seeks more reports in Duke lacrosse case\\", The News & Observer, August 31, 2006. Mangum was transferred to Duke University Medical Center. Examination of her skin, arms, and legs revealed no swelling, no abnormalities, and three small cuts on her right knee and right heel. When asked, she specifically and repeatedly denied receiving any physical blows by hands. Further examination showed no tenderness in the back, chest, and neck.Parrish, R.B. (2009) The Duke Lacrosse Case: A Documentary History and Analysis of the Modern Scottsboro, p. 45; There was, however, diffuse swelling of her vagina. Mangum later claimed that she had performed using a vibrator for a couple in a hotel room shortly before the lacrosse team party. This activity, or a yeast infection, could have caused the swelling. Investigators did not note any other injuries in the rest of the report.\\"Piecing together what happened at the Duke lacrosse-team party\\" , The Seattle Times, May 20, 2006. =McFadyen e-mail= A couple of hours after the party ended, Ryan McFadyen, a member of the lacrosse team, sent an e-mail to other players saying that he planned to have some strippers over, kill them, and cut off their skin while wearing his Duke-issue spandex and ejaculating. The e-mail began: > To whom it may concern, tomorrow night, after tonights show, ive decided to > have some strippers over to edens 2c. all are welcome.. however there will > be no nudity. I plan on killing the bitches as soon as the[y] walk in and > proceding to cut their skin off while cumming in my duke issue spandex . . > all in besides arch and tack [two of his teammates] please respondRyan > McFadyen e-mail , vanityfair.com, March 2014; accessed November 22, 2014. Some of the players suggested the e-mail was intended as humorous irony. Administrators asserted the e-mail was an imitation of Patrick Bateman, the protagonist in the Bret Easton Ellis novel, American Psycho, which was read and lectured upon in more than one Duke class, as shown by the e-mail responses from other players. One response read, \\"I'll bring the Phil Collins,\\" another reference to the American Psycho book and film. Police released the McFadyen e-mail but refused to release the following e-mail exchanges, leaving the impression that the McFadyen e-mail was actually intended as a serious threat. McFadyen thereafter received a thousand death threats in one week.Parrish, R. B. (2009) The Duke Lacrosse Case: A Documentary History and Analysis of the Modern Scottsboro, pp. 159-61; . The e-mail led many people to assume guilt on the part of the players. McFadyen was not charged with any crime, but he was temporarily suspended from Duke, with the university citing safety concerns. He was invited back to Duke to continue his studies later that summer. Investigation and prosecution =Arrests and investigation timeline= On March 14, 2006, the day after the party, the Durham Police Department (DPD) began their investigation into the rape allegations by interviewing Mangum and searching 610 North Buchanan pursuant to a warrant. The three team captains who lived at the house, including Evans, voluntarily gave statements and DNA samples to police and offered to take lie detector tests. The police turned down the offer. The DPD made their investigation public on March 15, when Sgt. Mark Gottlieb, the police supervisor, posted on a digital community bulletin board that they were investigating the rape of a young woman by three males at 610 North Buchanan on March 13, and asking anyone in the area who saw or heard anything unusual to contact Investigator Benjamin Himan. Between March 16 and 21, police showed Mangum photo arrays in an attempt to have her identify her attackers. Each photo array only contained photographs of lacrosse team members, and did not follow the DPD's recommended policy of including photos of individuals not regarded as potential suspects (known as \\"fillers\\"). Mangum identified Seligmann as someone who attended the party, but not as an attacker, and did not identify Evans at all despite seeing his photo twice.Summary of Conclusions , North Carolina Attorney General's Office & North Carolina Department of Justice, online at ncdoj.gov, accessed May 13, 2015. On March 27, Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong received his first briefing on the case from Gottlieb and Himan. Within a few hours of receiving the briefing, Nifong made his first public statement on the case. Over the following week, Nifong by his own estimate gave fifty to seventy interviews and devoted more than forty hours to reporters. After that, he continued to make statements, although less frequently. Many of these statements concerned the team members' alleged failure or refusal to provide information to law enforcement authorities; their invocation of their constitutional rights; or Nifong's own opinions that a crime had occurred, that it was racially motivated, and that one or more lacrosse players were guilty. Mangum was shown another photo array containing only photos of the 46 white lacrosse team members, including members who had not attended the party, and with no fillers. The photos were shown to Mangum as a PowerPoint presentation, with each photo projected individually to Mangum, instead of displaying all the pictures arrayed together. For the first time, Mangum identified photos of Seligmann, Evans, and Finnerty as her attackers. She also identified at least one other photo as being a player who was present at the party; further investigation showed he had not been there. On April 10, an attorney retained by one of the lacrosse players stated that time-stamped photographs existed which showed that Mangum was already injured when she arrived at the party, and was very impaired.\\"Attorney: Photos will clear Duke lacrosse players\\" , ESPN, April 10, 2006.

On December 28, 2006, the North Carolina bar filed ethics charges against Nifong over his conduct in the case, accusing him of making public statements that were prejudicial to the administration of justice and heightened public condemnation of the accused, and of engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. The 17-page document accused Nifong of violating four rules of professional conduct, listing more than 100 examples of statements he made to the media.\\"State Bar Files Ethics Complaint Against Mike Nifong\\" , WRAL.com, December 28, 2006. On January 12, 2007, Nifong sent a letter to North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper asking to be taken off the case, citing the responsibility of the case to the Attorney General's office. The following day, January 13, Cooper announced that his office would take over the case. On January 24, 2007, the North Carolina State Bar filed a second round of ethics charges against Nifong for a systematic abuse of prosecutorial discretion that was prejudicial to the administration of justice when he withheld DNA evidence to mislead the court. On March 23, 2007, Justin Paul Caulfield, a legal analyst for the sports magazine Inside Lacrosse, stated on Fox News that the charges against Evans, Finnerty, and Seligmann would soon be dropped. While the North Carolina Attorney General's Office first disputed the report, on April 11, 2007, it announced that it had dismissed all charges against the three lacrosse players. Cooper not only dismissed the charges but also took the unusual step of declaring the accused players innocent. Cooper also announced that Mangum would not be prosecuted, stating that investigators and attorneys that had interviewed her thought \\"she may actually believe the many different stories that she has been telling ... it's in the best interest of justice not to bring charges\\". On April 12, 2007, the attorney general, in declaring Seligmann, Finnerty, and Evans innocent, also called Nifong a \\"rogue prosecutor\\".\\"As Duke rape case unravels, D.A.'s judgment questioned: Defense describes him as willing to skirt law for conviction\\" , San Francisco Chronicle\\"Embattled Nifong Says He will Resign\\" =DNA tests= Shortly after the party, the prosecution ordered 46 of the 47 lacrosse team members to provide DNA samples, although some members had been absent from the party. The sole black member of the team was exempt because Mangum had stated that her attackers were white. On April 10, 2006, it was announced that DNA testing by the state crime lab had failed to connect any of the 46 tested team members to the alleged rape. After the initial tests by the state crime lab, prosecutor Nifong sought the services of a private laboratory, DNA Security Inc. (aka DSI) of Burlington, North Carolina, to conduct additional tests. DNA from multiple unidentified males was found inside Mangum and upon the rape kit items that had been tested, but none matched any of the lacrosse players. Nifong falsely represented to the court and the public that DNA had only been found from a single male source, Mangum's boyfriend. In a motion made on December 15, 2006, defense attorneys argued that the DNA analysis report written by DSI and provided to them by Nifong's office was incomplete, because it omitted information showing that none of the genetic material from several men found on Mangum matched any DNA sample from the lacrosse team. Brian Meehan, the director of DSI who wrote the misleading report, testified that his lab did not try to withhold information, but acknowledged that the decision not to release the full report violated the lab's policies. Meehan testified that after discussions with Nifong, he decided to withhold the names of the persons excluded by the DNA testing (all 46 tested members of the lacrosse team) to protect the privacy of players not implicated in the case, despite the fact that two players (Reade Seligmann and Collin Finnerty) had already been indicted for rape more than three weeks prior to the release date of the report.\\"Paternity Test Ordered in Duke Lacrosse Rape Case\\" , WRAL.com, December 15, 2006. Meehan was later fired in October 2007 based on this incident. DNA was also taken from all surfaces of three of Mangum's false fingernails retrieved from the trash in the party house bathroom (widely but inaccurately reported as DNA taken only from the \\"underside\\" of a single fingernail). According to DNA Security, the fingernail DNA showed some characteristics similar to lacrosse player David Evans's DNA. However, the match was not conclusive, as 2% of the male population (including Evans) could not be excluded based on the sample.\\"Report: DNA link possible for third Duke player\\" , Associated Press and the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review May 12, 2006. In addition, because Evans lived in the house, defense attorneys contended that any DNA present might have come from the tissue paper, cotton swabs, or other hygiene-related trash that had been in the garbage can along with the fingernail. This was confirmed later by Attorney General Cooper's investigation: \\"to the extent that Evans's DNA could not be excluded, the SBI experts confirmed that the DNA could easily have been transferred to the fingernails from other materials in the trash can\\". Nifong contended that lack of DNA evidence is not unusual and that 75‚Äì80% of all sexual assault cases lack DNA evidence. Rape victims often delay reporting by days or weeks, inadvertently destroying DNA evidence. However, in this case, Mangum had a rape-kit exam administered only hours after the end of the party, so the absence of DNA evidence was considered unlikely by legal experts.Spilbor, Jonna. \\"The Rape That Never Was: Why, In Light Of The Lack Of DNA Evidence, The Case Against Duke's Lacrosse Team Should Be Dropped\\" , FindLaw.com, April 14, 2006. At Nifong's subsequent ethics trial on June 14, 2007, the complete DNA findings were revealed during defense attorney Brad Bannon's testimony. According to conservative estimates, the lab had discovered at least two unidentified males' DNA in Mangum's pubic region; at least two unidentified males' DNA in her rectum; at least four to five unidentified males' DNA on her underpants; and at least one identified male's DNA in her vagina.Y-Str (Male) DNA Characteristics Discovered by DNA Security on the Rape Kit Items ; retrieved June 14, 2007. =Collin Finnerty previous incident= In November 2005, Finnerty and two of his Chaminade High School lacrosse teammates had previously been charged with misdemeanor simple assault in Washington, D.C., following an altercation with a Washington man outside a Georgetown bar.Macur, Juliet. \\"Amid Scrutiny at Duke, Details Emerge of '05 Assault\\", The New York Times, April 5, 2006.

Although the man alleged that Finnerty and his companions had called him \\"gay\\" (among other derogatory names), the incident was not prosecuted as a hate crime. Finnerty was initially accepted into a diversion program for first offenders, allowing for the simple assault charge to be dismissed upon his completion of community service. However, after the Durham charges appeared, the Washington, D.C. prosecutor cancelled his diversion agreement and proceeded with the assault charge. At trial, the chief defense witness was not permitted to testify and police officers presented details which were not in their notes. Finnerty was convicted and sentenced to six months' probation. Thereafter, he was repeatedly threatened by the judge (John H. Bayly, Jr.) with confinement; once, after an anonymous blog post falsely accused him of violating an order preventing him from being in Georgetown; and again after he was absent from home and missed an obligatory curfew in order to be in Durham to work on his defense there, an absence which he had previously cleared with the judge. Some observers noted the similarity of this treatment with previous attempts by the government to pressure witnesses to testify in a certain manner.Parrish, R.B.

Defense and media questioning =Credibility of Crystal Mangum as accuser= Possible intoxication and mental state Lawyers for the Duke lacrosse players have said that Mangum was intoxicated with alcohol and possibly other drugs on the night of the party.\\"Alleged Duke Rape Victim Wants Her Life Back\\" , ABC News, April 19, 2006. By the accuser's own admission to police, she had taken prescription Flexeril and drunk \\"one or two large-size beers\\" before she went to the party.\\"Report: Police Notes Bolster Prosecution Of Duke Lacrosse Case\\" The Attorney General's office later noted that Mangum had taken Ambien, methadone, Paxil, and amitriptyline, although when she began taking these medications is uncertain. She had a long history of mental problems and suffers from bipolar disorder. Inconsistencies in Mangum's story Over the course of the scandal, police reports, media investigations, and defense attorneys' motions and press conferences brought to light several key inconsistencies in Mangum's story.Khanna, Samiha & Anne Blythe. \\"Dancer gives details of ordeal\\" , The News & Observer, March 25, 2006. Some of the questions about her credibility were: * Durham police said that Mangum kept changing her story and was not credible, reporting that she initially told them she was raped by 20 white men, later reducing the number to only three. * Another police report states that Mangum initially claimed she was only groped, rather than raped, but changed her story before going to the hospital. * On December 22, 2006, Nifong dropped the rape charges after Mangum stated that she was penetrated from behind but that she did not know with what. In North Carolina, penetration with an object is considered sexual assault, not rape.\\"Rape Charges Dropped in Duke Case\\" , The New York Times, December 22, 2006. * On January 11, 2007, several more inconsistencies came to light after the defense filed a motion detailing her interview on December 21, 2006. For example, she changed details about when she was attacked, who attacked her, and how they attacked her:  In the new version from the December 21 interview, Mangum claims she was attacked from 11:35 p.m. to midnight, much earlier than her previous accusations. This new timing is before the well- documented alibi evidence for Reade Seligmann that places him away from the house. However, the defense revealed that this new timing would suggest Seligmann was on the phone with his girlfriend during the height of the attack. Additionally, she received an incoming call at 11:36 p.m. and somebody stayed on the line for 3 minutes, which would be during the party according to the new timetable.  The new statement contradicts time-stamped photos that show her dancing between 12:00 and 12:04 a.m. It would also mean that they stayed at the party for nearly an hour after the supposed attack since Kim Roberts drove her away at 12:53 a.m. In her April statement, Mangum said they left immediately after the attack.  Mangum changed the names of her attackers, claiming they had used multiple pseudonyms.  The accuser also changed her description of Evans. She previously claimed that she was attacked by a man that looked like Evans except with a mustache, but later stated that the assailant just had a five o'clock shadow.  Mangum claimed that Evans stood in front of her, making her perform oral sex on him. Previously, she stated that Seligmann did this. In the latest statement, she stated that Seligmann did not commit any sex act on her and that he had said that he could not participate because he was getting married. Although he has a girlfriend, there has never been anything to suggest he was engaged or getting married. * North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper said Mangum told many different accounts of the attack. In one account, she claimed she was suspended in mid- air and was being assaulted by all three of them in the bathroom. Cooper then said this event seemed very implausible because of the small size of the bathroom. According to a 60 Minutes investigation, Mangum gave at least a dozen different stories. * In its own investigation, The News & Observer, North Carolina's second largest newspaper, determined that Mangum gave at least five different versions of the incident to police and medical interviewers by August 2006. * Mangum, at one point, claimed both Evans and Finnerty helped her into her car upon departure. However, a photo shows her being helped by another player, while electronic records and witnesses reported that Evans and Finnerty had already left. Upon seeing the photo, Mangum claimed that it must have been doctored or that Duke University paid someone off.\\"The Duke Case: Innocent\\" , cbsnews.com, April 15, 2007. * Mangum did not consistently choose the same three defendants in the photo lineups. Media reports have disclosed at least two photo lineups that occurred in March and April in which she was asked to recall who she saw at the party and in what capacity. In the March lineup, she did not choose Dave Evans at all. There was only one individual she identified as being at the party with 100% certainty during both procedures ‚Äì Brad Ross.Suppression , abclocal.go.com; retrieved June 2, 2007. After being identified, Ross provided to police investigators indisputable evidence that he was with his girlfriend at North Carolina State University before, during, and after the party through cell phone records as well as an affidavit from a witness. Other credibility issues The Duke defense lawyers or media reports have indicated: * The second stripper who performed at the house, Kim Roberts, said that Mangum was not raped. She stated that Mangum was not obviously hurt. Likewise, she refuted other aspects of Mangum's story including denying that she helped dress Mangum after the party and saying that they were not forcefully separated by players as Mangum had reported.\\"Duke accuser lying, second stripper says\\", msnbc.com, October 13, 2006. * DNA results revealed that Mangum had sex with a man who was not a Duke lacrosse player. Attorney Joseph Cheshire said the tests indicated DNA from a single male source came from a vaginal swab. Media outlets reported that this DNA was from her boyfriend. However, it was later revealed that DNA from multiple males who were neither the lacrosse players nor Mangum's boyfriend had been found, but that these findings had been deliberately withheld from the Court and the defense.Tad Nelson, \\"Duke Lacrosse Debacle and Accuser‚Äôs Credibility\\", FoxNews, January 14, 2007. * She had made a similar claim in the past which she did not pursue. On August 18, 1996, the dancer ‚Äì then 18 years old ‚Äì told a police officer in Creedmoor she had been raped by three men in June 1993, according to a police document. The officer who took the woman's report at that time asked her to write a detailed timeline of the night's events and bring the account back to the police, but she never returned.Duke Rape Suspects Speak Out . 60 Minutes, October 15, 2006. * The strip club's security officer said that Mangum told co-workers four days after the party that she was going to get money from some boys at a Duke party who had not paid her, mentioning that the boys were white. The security guard did not make a big deal of it because he felt that no one took her seriously. * Mangum was arrested in 2002 for stealing a cab from a strip club where she had been working. She led police officers on a high-speed chase before she was apprehended, at which point her blood alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit.Graham, David.

Another person whom the accuser had identified in April also provided police with evidence that he did not attend the party at all. In regards to Seligmann's identification, Mangum's confidence increased from 70% in March to 100% in April. Gary Wells ‚Äî an Iowa State University professor and expert on police identification procedures ‚Äî has asserted that memory does not improve with time.Conflicting Identifications . The News & Observer; retrieved December 24, 2006. According to the transcript of the photo identification released on The Abrams Report, Mangum also stated that David Evans had a mustache on the night of the attack. Evans's lawyer stated that his client has never had a mustache and that photos as well as eyewitness testimony would reveal that Evans has never had a mustache. Accusations of intimidation tactics Defense lawyers suggested police used intimidation tactics on witnesses. On May 11, Moezeldin Elmostafa, an immigrant taxi driver who signed a sworn statement about Seligmann's whereabouts that defense lawyers say provides a solid alibi, was arrested on a 2¬Ω-year-old shoplifting charge. Arresting officers first asked if he had anything new to say about the lacrosse case. When he refused to alter his testimony, he was taken into custody. An arrest and conviction would have destroyed his chance for citizenship and could have led to his deportation. Elmostafa was subsequently tried on the shoplifting charge and acquitted, after a grainy security tape proved that a security guard who was the prosecution's chief witness had \\"misremembered\\" events.Parrish, R. B. (2009) The Duke Lacrosse Case: A Documentary History and Analysis of the Modern Scottsboro, pp. 157-58; Police also arrested Mangum's former husband, Kenneth McNeil; her boyfriend, Matthew Murchison; and another friend, with the disposition of their own separate cases entirely in the hands of District Attorney Nifong. The daughter of Durham's police chief was arrested on an old warrant, and the chief himself remained absent from duty and invisible to the press for most of the case.Parrish, R. B. (2009) The Duke Lacrosse Case: A Documentary History and Analysis of the Modern Scottsboro, pp. 175-76; Supervisor The News & Observer suggested that the supervisor of the lacrosse investigation, Sgt. Mark Gottlieb, had unfairly targeted Duke students in the past, putting some of his investigational tactics into question. Gottlieb has made a disproportionate number of arrests of Duke students for misdemeanor violations, such as carrying an open container of alcohol. Normally, these violations earn offenders a pink ticket similar to a traffic ticket. From May 2005 to February 2006, when Sgt. Gottlieb was a patrol officer in District 2, he made 28 total arrests. Twenty of those arrests were Duke students, and at least 15 were handcuffed and taken to jail. This is in stark contrast to the other two officers on duty in the same district during that same 10-month period. They made 64 total arrests, only two of which were Duke students. Similarly, The News & Observer charges that Gottlieb treated non-students very differently. For example, he wrote up a young man for illegally carrying a concealed .45-caliber handgun and possession of marijuana (crimes far more severe than the Duke students who were taken to jail committed), but did not take him to jail. Residents complimented Gottlieb for dealing fairly with loud parties and disorderly conduct by students. Duke's student newspaper, The Chronicle, depicted other examples of violence and dishonesty from Sgt. Gottlieb. It published that one student threw a party at his rental home off-East Campus before the Rolling Stones concert in October 2005. The morning after the concert, at 3 A.M., Sgt. Gottlieb led a raid on the home with nine other officers while the students were half asleep. It reported that one student was dragged out of bed and then dragged down the stairs. It reported that all seven housemates were put in handcuffs, arrested, and taken into custody for violating a noise ordinance and open container of alcohol violations. Sgt. Gottlieb reportedly told one student, an American citizen of Serbian descent, that the student could be deported. Other stories include the throwing of a 130 pound male against his car for an open container of alcohol violation, refusing the ID of a student since he was international, searching through a purse without a warrant, refusing to tell a student her rights, and accusations of perjury.Mueller, Jared. \\"Students criticize lax cop's behavior\\" , The Chronicle; accessed September 11, 2006. =Prosecutor Nifong's actions= Possible political motivation At the time the rape allegations were made in March 2006, Mike Nifong was in the midst of a difficult Democratic primary election campaign to keep his position as Durham County District Attorney, facing strong opposition. It was understood that if Nifong lost the primary, he would very likely lose his job. Some commentators have opined that Nifong's prosecution of the Duke lacrosse players and his many statements to the media were driven by his political strategy to attract African-American voters. The primary was held on May 6, 2006, and Nifong won by a slim margin of 883 votes. Results showed Nifong won the primary on the basis of strong support from the black community. Nifong went on to win the general election in November 2006, although by a lower margin than usual for Democratic candidates in Durham County at that time. Prosecution's chief investigator Nifong hired Linwood E. Wilson as his chief investigator. During Wilson's private detective career, at least seven formal inquiries into his conduct were performed. In 1997, Wilson was reprimanded by the state commission. After his appeal of the decision was rejected, he allowed his detective license to expire. In response to criticism, Wilson stated that no one had ever questioned his integrity. On June 25, 2007, shortly after Nifong's disbarment and removal from office, it was reported that Nifong's replacement, interim district attorney Jim Hardin Jr., fired Wilson from his post.

On April 5, 2006, he resigned (later revealed to have been forced) shortly after the McFadyen e-mail became public. Through his lawyer, he stated that his resignation was not an admission of wrongdoing on his part. On the same day, Richard H. Brodhead, president of Duke University, suspended the remainder of the lacrosse season.\\"Duke lacrosse coach resigns, rest of season canceled\\" , Associated Press, April 6, 2006.

Photographs of lacrosse team members had been posted prominently around Durham and on the Duke University campus with accompanying captions requesting that they come forward with information about the incident. =Media policies regarding identity revelation of accusers and accused= Fox News was the sole national television news outlet to reveal Mangum's photo following the dismissal of the case, although MSNBC and 60 Minutes revealed her name. Several major broadcasters did not publish Mangum's name at any point, including ABC, PBS, CNN, and NBC. Publication of Mangum's identity Partially obscured photos of Mangum at the party were broadcast by The Abrams Report on cable news channel MSNBC and by local television affiliate NBC 17 WNCN in North Carolina. On April 21, 2006, outspoken talk-radio host Tom Leykis disclosed Mangum's name during his nationally syndicated talk-radio program. Leykis has disclosed identities of accusers of sexual assault in the past. On May 15, 2006, MSNBC host Tucker Carlson disclosed Mangum's first name only on his show, Tucker.Tucker , NBC News, May 15, 2006. Court records presented by the defense revealed Mangum's name. On April 11, 2007, several other mainstream media sources revealed or used Mangum's name and/or picture after the attorney general dropped all the charges and declared the players innocent.

On May 1, 2006, the New Black Panthers held a protest outside Duke University. The case drew national attention and highlighted racial tensions within the Durham area. =Jesse Jackson and Rainbow/Push Involvement= In 2006, Jesse Jackson promised the Rainbow/Push Coalition would pay the college tuition for Mangum. Jackson said the tuition offer would still be good even if Mangum had fabricated her story. Aftermath =Mike Nifong= On June 16, 2007, the North Carolina State Bar ordered Nifong disbarred after the bar's three-member disciplinary panel unanimously found him guilty of fraud, dishonesty, deceit or misrepresentation; of making false statements of material fact before a judge; of making false statements of material fact before bar investigators, and of lying about withholding exculpatory DNA evidence. Following the state bar's announcement, Nifong submitted a letter of resignation from his post as Durham County district attorney, that would have become effective in July 2007. However, on June 18, Durham Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson ordered that Nifong be immediately removed from office.\\"Judge Suspends Resigned Nifong From DA's Office\\" , wral.com, June 18, 2007. On August 31, 2007, Nifong was held in criminal contempt of court for knowingly making false statements to the court during the criminal proceedings. Durham Superior Court Judge W. Osmond Smith III sentenced Nifong to one day in jail, which he subsequently served. =Crystal Mangum= On December 15, 2006, it was reported that Mangum was pregnant and the judge in the case ordered a paternity test.CBS's 60 Minutes segment \\"Duke Rape Suspects Speak Out\\" , cbsnews.com, October 15, 2006.\\"Who is the real victim in the Duke lacrosse case?\\" , rightsideoftheroad.com, January 8, 2007. In May 2008, Mangum graduated from North Carolina Central University with a degree in police psychology.\\"Summa cum loony\\" On August 22, 2008, a press release announced the planned publication in October 2008 of a memoir by Mangum, The Last Dance for Grace: The Crystal Mangum Story. The press release indicated the book \\"can't and doesn't deal with the complex legal aspects of the case\\" but that \\"the muddling of facts about Crystal's life, along with North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper's desire to settle the dispute over open file discovery, swallowed the case whole\\". Defense attorney Joseph Cheshire responded to the news by saying that if the book was truthful, \\"I think it would be fabulous, and I don't think anybody would think badly about her in any way, shape or form\\", but that if the memoir did not acknowledge the falsity of her allegations against the players, that he would advise them to initiate civil action against her.\\"Duke lacrosse attorney hopes accuser admits she lied\\" , wral.com; retrieved September 5, 2008. Her book was published later that year. In it, she continued to contend that she had been raped at the party and that the dropping of the case was politically motivated. The book outlined her earlier life, including a claim that she was first raped at the age of 14.Andrew Hibbard, \\"Memoir chronicles lax accuser's troubled life\\", dukechronicle.com; accessed November 6, 2008.

She argued that she acted in self-defense, fearing that Daye would kill her. She was sentenced to 14 to 18 years in prison. =Reade Seligmann, Collin Finnerty, and David Evans= On June 18, 2007, Duke University announced that it had reached a settlement with Seligmann, Finnerty and Evans. No details of the settlement were disclosed. According to author William D. Cohan, Duke reportedly agreed to pay $60 million to the three accused (with each player receiving $20 million) subject to confidentiality requirements.Flanagan, Caitlin, \\"Sunday Book Review: Nothing to Cheer About. 'The Price of Silence' by William D. Cohan\\" , nytimes.com, April 24, 2014; accessed May 11, 2015. Seligmann's attorney told the New York Daily News that the settlement was \\"nowhere near that much money\\". Seligmann enrolled as a student at Brown University in the fall of 2007, and was an important part of Brown reaching the 2009 NCAA lacrosse tournament as well as a number 10 national ranking. He became an active fundraiser and supporter for the Innocence Project.Clemmons, Anna Katherine, \\"Former Duke Players Move Forward\\" ESPN.com, March 10, 2010. Retrieved May 11, 2015. He graduated from Brown in 2010 and from Emory University School of Law in 2013.

Finnerty enrolled at Loyola College in Maryland, leading the team in scoring as the Greyhounds qualified for the 2010 NCAA lacrosse tournament. Finnerty graduated from Loyola in May 2010. David Evans, who had already graduated from Duke before being charged, received an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in May 2012. =Duke men's lacrosse team= In January 2007, lacrosse team member Kyle Dowd filed a lawsuit against Duke University and against a visiting associate professor and member of the Group of 88, Kim Curtis, claiming he and another teammate were given failing grades on their final paper as a form of retaliation after the scandal broke. The case was settled with the terms undisclosed except that Dowd's grade was altered to a P (for \\"Pass\\"). Professor Houston Baker, who continued to accuse Dowd and the others of being \\"hooligans\\" and \\"rapists\\", called Dowd's mother \\"the mother of a farm animal\\" after she e-mailed him. Duke Provost Peter Lange responded to Baker, criticizing Baker for prejudging the team based on race and gender, citing this as a classic tactic of racism.Peter Applebome, \\"After Duke Prosecution Began to Collapse, Demonizing Continued\\" , The New York Times, April 15, 2007. Duke's Athletic Director at the time, Joe Alleva, who forced lacrosse coach Mike Pressler's resignation, faced criticism for his handling of this case. In 2008, Alleva announced he was leaving Duke for the Athletic Director position at Louisiana State University.\\"Alleva's tenure saw Duke's best and worst\\" , Duke Chronicle, April 14, 2008. The lacrosse team, reinstated for the 2007 season, reached the NCAA Finals as the #1 seed. The Blue Devils lost to the Johns Hopkins University Blue Jays in the championship, 12‚Äì11. In May 2007, Duke requested that the NCAA restore a year's eligibility to the players on the 2006 men's team, part of whose season was canceled. The NCAA granted the team's request for another year of eligibility, which applies to the 33 members of the 2006 team who were underclassmen in 2006 and who remained at Duke in 2007. Four of the seniors from 2006 attended graduate school at Duke in 2007 and played for the team. In 2010, the final year in which the team included fifth-year seniors (freshmen in 2006), Duke won the NCAA Lacrosse Championship beating Notre Dame, 6‚Äì5 in overtime, to give the school its first lacrosse championship. On June 7, 2007, it was announced that lacrosse coach Mike Pressler and Duke had reached a financial settlement. Pressler was later hired as coach by Division II (now Division I) Bryant University in Rhode Island. In October 2007, Pressler filed suit seeking to undo the settlement and hold a trial on his wrongful termination claim on the grounds that Duke spokesman John Burness had made disparaging comments about him. After Duke failed in an attempt to have the case dismissed, the matter was settled in 2010 with Duke apologizing in a press release but refusing to comment regarding any compensation to Pressler.Duke settles with former lacrosse coach Pressler , TheChronicle.com; accessed November 21, 2014. On August 25, 2007, multiple sources predicted the players would file a federal civil-rights lawsuit against the city of Durham. =Duke University= On September 29, 2007, Duke President Brodhead, speaking at a two-day conference at Duke Law School on the practice and ethics of trying cases in the media, apologized for \\"causing the families to feel abandoned when they most needed support.\\" On July 12, 2010, Duke demolished the house where the party had taken place, 610 North Buchanan Boulevard, after it had sat unoccupied for the four years following the Duke lacrosse case.\\"Infamous Duke lacrosse house demolished\\" , abclocal.go.com; retrieved July 13, 2010..

Mark Gottlieb committed suicide in Dekalb County, Georgia where he had worked as a paramedic.Former detective in Duke lacrosse rape case commits suicide in Georgia , wral.com; retrieved July 16, 2014. Lawsuits filed by players On September 7, 2007, it was reported that the three accused players (Seligmann, Finnerty, and Evans), who had already settled with Duke University, planned to file a lawsuit for violations of their civil rights against the city of Durham and several city employees, unless the city agreed to a settlement including payment of $30 million over five years and the passage of new criminal justice reform laws. The city's liability insurance covers up to $5 million. Lawyers cited three main areas of vulnerability for the city: * The suspect-only photo identification procedure given to Mangum. * Vast discrepancies in notes taken by Investigator Benjamin Himan during his March interview with Mangum and Sgt. Gottlieb's notes in July * The release of a CrimeStoppers poster by the police shortly after the allegations that a woman \\"was sodomized, raped, assaulted and robbed. This horrific crime sent shock waves throughout our community.\\" Durham declined the settlement offer and on October 5, 2007, the three accused players filed a federal lawsuit alleging a broad conspiracy to frame them. Named in the suit were Nifong, the lab that handled the DNA work, the city of Durham, the city's former police chief, the deputy police chief, the two police detectives who handled the case and five other police department employees. The players were seeking unspecified damages, and also wanted to place the Durham Police Department under court supervision for 10 years, claiming the actions of the police department posed \\"a substantial risk of irreparable injury to other persons in the City of Durham\\". According to the suit, Nifong engineered the conspiracy to help him win support for his election bid. Nifong reportedly told his campaign manager that the case would provide \\"'millions of dollars' in free advertising\\". On January 15, 2008, the city of Durham filed a motion to remove itself as a defendant, arguing it had no responsibility for Nifong's actions. On the same day, Nifong filed for bankruptcy. On May 27, 2008, Judge William L. Stocks lifted the stay from Nifong's bankruptcy filing and ruled that the plaintiffs lawsuit could go forward. On March 31, 2011, Judge James Beaty issued a ruling on the Evans et al. case, upholding claims against Nifong and his hired investigator Wilson for conspiracy to commit malicious prosecution in the course of their investigation; the city of Durham for negligence; Nifong, Wilson, and police investigators Gottlieb and Himan for malicious prosecution, concealment of evidence, and fabrication of false evidence. However, the players' civil rights claims, which constituted the bulk of their Complaint, were dismissed on the grounds that the applicable civil rights laws pertained only to persons of African-American descent.Judge James Beaty, Memorandum Opinion, March 31, 2011. > Plaintiffs contend that they have alleged race discrimination as white > plaintiffs. However, the ¬ß 1985 claims based on this *971 contention fails > for two reasons.

On December 17, 2012, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected all of the players' federal claims in Evans v Chalmers Case No. 11-1436 (C.A. 4), holding: > To recapitulate, we hold as follows. We reverse the district court's denial > of all defendants' motions to dismiss the federal claims alleged against > them. We reverse the court's denial of the City's motion for summary > judgment as to the state common-law claims alleged against it.

Plaintiffs have sought to raise every experimental claim and to corral > every conceivable defendant. The result is a case on the far limbs of law > and one destined, were it to succeed in whole, to spread damage in all > directions. On October 7, 2013, the United States Supreme Court denied the Petition for Certorari filed by Seligmann, Finnerty, and Evans, declining to review the decision of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. On May 16, 2014, the three accused lacrosse players and the City of Durham settled their long-running lawsuit. Seligmann, Finnerty, and Evans agreed to dismiss their lawsuit and received no monetary compensation whatsoever. The city agreed to make a $50,000 grant to the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission. Lawsuit filed by non-accused players and their families On February 21, 2008, the families of 38 of the lacrosse team's 47 members who were not accused filed a 225-page lawsuit against Duke University, the Duke University Hospital, the city of Durham, and various officials of each organization for multiple claims of harassment, deprivation of civil rights, breach of contract and other claims. A Duke University spokesperson responded that \\"we have now seen the lawsuit and as we said before, if these plaintiffs have a complaint, it is with Mr. Nifong. Their legal strategy ‚Äì attacking Duke ‚Äì is misdirected and without merit. To help these families move on, Duke offered to cover the cost of any attorneys' fees or other out-of-pocket expenses, but they rejected this offer. We will vigorously defend the university against these claims.\\" The city never released an official response to the suit. The lawsuit against the university was settled out of court in 2013. Neither side would discuss the details of the settlement. ESPN documentary: Fantastic Lies The 2016 documentary film Fantastic Lies, which centered around the case and its aftermath, was part of ESPN's 30 for 30 film series. It premiered on March 13, 2016, 10 years to the day after the lacrosse players hosted the house party where Mangum claimed she was raped. Among the journalists invited to contribute was ESPN college basketball analyst and Duke graduate Jay Bilas, who in his other capacity as a practicing attorney later wrote a letter to the university administration criticizing their handling of the entire situation and describing president Brodhead as \\"incapable of effectively leading Duke into the future.\\" Crystal Mangum was approached by the film crew to tell her side of the story and agreed to do so, but prison officials would not allow her to be filmed. None of the players involved in the case appeared in the film, but Reade Seligmann‚Äôs parents and David Evans‚Äô father did.

During its two-year existence, OutWeek was widely considered the leading voice of AIDS activism and the initiator of a cool new sensibility in lesbian and gay journalism. Founding OutWeek was originally conceived by musician and producer Gabriel Rotello. As a member of the activist group ACT UP, Rotello felt that New York needed a publication that would represent ACT UP‚Äôs new, more radical approach to activism. At the same time, businessman and ACT UP member Kendall Morrison was planning to start a New York magazine that would provide a venue for advertising his popular gay phone sex businesses. Although neither Rotello nor Morrison had any experience in journalism, the two decided to team up, with Morrison acting as publisher and Rotello as editor-in-chief. From its first issue on June 26, 1989, OutWeek attracted considerable attention and the magazine repeatedly broke major stories both in New York and nationally.  Major Articles  In the January 21, 1990 issue, Outweek covered the Covenant House sex scandal and had an exclusive interview with Father Bruce Ritter's main accuser, Kevin Kite. Bruce Ritter was accused of sexual abuse and financial misconduct during his time as the head of Covenant House, a ‚Äúfaith based social service organization.‚Äù Also in the January 21st issue, OutWeek took part in a major local controversy by revealing that the newly appointed Health Commissioner of New York City, Woodrow A. Myers, advocated the ‚Äúmandatory name reporting, contact tracing and quarantining‚Äù of people with AIDS. As New York's Mayor David Dinkins appointed Meyers, the subsequent controversy impacted him and pitted his gay supporters against his black supporters, leading the New York Times to call the dispute \\"by far the most bitter\\" of the Dinkins administration. By repeatedly breaking major stories, and through its intense coverage of the AIDS crisis, OutWeek became a significant journalistic presence in New York. Outing Controversy Cover of the OutWeek issue outing Malcolm Forbes OutWeek is probably best remembered for sparking the \\"outing\\" controversy. This began in Michelangelo Signorile's \\"GossipWatch\\" columns, in which the fiery writer railed against then-closeted public figures like David Geffen and Liz Smith for what he considered their complicity in a culture of silence around AIDS and gay rights. Outing in this context refers to the practice of revealing the sexual orientation of another person without permission. The new use of this term was popularized in 1990 by Time Magazine in an article titled \\"Forcing Gays Out of the Closet\\" which defined outing as 'the intentional exposure of secret gays by other gays.\\" Activists employed the use of outing in response to the silence or lack of support of public figures in regards to the AIDS epidemic with the goal of making the people they outed more supportive of the movement. On the death of Malcolm Forbes, tycoon, multimillionaire, and editor in chief of Forbes magazine, in early 1990, OutWeek pushed the issue of outing to the limit by publishing a cover story \\"The Secret Gay Life of Malcolm Forbes.\\" This March 18, 1990 issue of OutWeek included articles about Forbes titled \\"Claiming Forbes for the Gay Nation,\\" \\"The Other Side of Malcolm,\\" and \\"Working in the Capitalist Closet.\\" This story became a media sensation and prompted significant debates over the practice of outing. Major news sources that discussed this controversy included the Sun Sentinel, the Los Angeles Times, and The Washington Post. In their book Outing: Shattering the Conspiracy of Silence, Warren Johansson and William A. Percy state that the editorial \\"Claiming Forbes for the Gay Nation\\" was \\"the manifesto of outing\\" and argue that \\"OutWeek's bold move marked a new phase in the struggle to tear down the closet door.\\" Besides full-fledged expos√©s, OutWeek practiced outing through Michelangelo Signorile's \\"Peek-A-Boo\\" boxes which simply contained names of individuals and left the rest up to the reader's interpretation. The \\"Peek-A-Boo\\" box in the August 1st issue had sixty-six names including Michael Jackson, Robert Downey Jr., Olivia Newton John, and John Travolta. Ironically, OutWeek outed only a handful of public figures during its existence, mostly in Signorile's column. However, its vigorous defense of the idea that the media should treat the homosexuality of public figures the way it treats any other aspect of their private lives galvanized supporters, outraged opponents and forever stamped the magazine as the place where outing began. Closing In June 1991 it published its last edition, almost two years after it first appeared. It published 105 issues in all, and The New York Times reported OutWeek's circulation at between 30,000 and 40,000 copies. Despite its journalistic awards and avid readership, OutWeek struggled to make a profit. According to The New York Times, the closing was the result of financial problems and fighting within the leadership. In its article on the demise of Outweek, The New York Times noted that \\"Outweek established itself from the start as the most progressive of the gay publications. Its controversial practice of \\"outing\\"‚Äîexposing public figures who are gay and lesbian‚Äîand its support of Act-Up and Queer Nation, two activist gay organizations, brought it national notoriety.\\" Impact Despite its brief existence, OutWeek left a significant legacy in many areas. The magazine's constant presence in the general media, and its sparking of repeated controversies, helped bring gay and AIDS issues into the mainstream. Within the gay press, OutWeek caused a major shakeup. The Advocate, the nation's oldest gay publication, saw its circulation decline relative to OutWeek. The result was a major revamp of the magazine. In 1990, The Advocate became a \\"gay and lesbian\\" publication for the first time, instead of just a magazine for gay men, and began to focus far more on politics and AIDS activism. Many other gay and lesbian publications became far feistier, and it is sometimes said that OutWeek pioneered a \\"new gay journalism.\\" Outing has become relatively mainstream, and the journalistic rules regarding the disclosure of the sexual orientation of public figures is now largely in keeping with OutWeek's original goals. For example, when publishing mogul Jann Wenner left his wife in the late 1990s, the Wall Street Journal reported on its front page - and without Wenner's permission - that he had begun a relationship with a younger man. OutWeek also stirred significant controversy by its use of the term \\"queer\\" as an inclusive and radical way to describe gay men, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people. The term was used several times in the first issue of OutWeek and in many of the following issues. The use of the word queer in this way is now relatively common, appearing in the titles of TV shows like Queer as Folk and Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. In regards to its impact, 'Time magazine wrote: \\"The magazine had earned recognition for its reporting on AIDS, homophobic assaults and gay politics, but its greatest success was in shaking up its competitors by challenging their brand of gay activism with a more militant stance.\\" The New York Times had a similar stance, stating that \\"OutWeek gave voice to a new generation of AIDS activists who had not previously had a public voice and provided a rallying point for the more militant members of the gay community.\\" Staff During OutWeek's existence, Rotello assembled a staff of young writers and editors. For many it was their first job in journalism, yet a large number went on to significant careers. Michelangelo Signorile became a well-known columnist, lecturer and author (Queer in America, Outing Yourself), and is now a popular talk-radio host on Sirius OutQ. Arts editor Sarah Pettit became the executive editor of Out Magazine, then editor-in-chief, and then the arts editor of Newsweek, before her death from cancer in 2003. Copy editor Walter Armstrong became the editor-in-chief of POZ (magazine). Staffers Dale Peck, Karl Soehnlein and Jim Provenzano all became well-known novelists. Columnist Michael Goff founded Out Magazine and was its first editor and president. He later became general manager of Microsoft's MSN, and Dan Gillmor's partner in early citizen-journalism effort, Bayosphere. Staffer Victoria Starr became an author and the biographer of k.d. lang. Production Manager Diana Osterfeld worked in Desktop Publishing (both creating magazines and training others at IMAGE Inc.) for many years before returning for a Masters in Architecture @ UT Austin. She is now in the process of becoming a licensed architect. Reporter David Kirby became a NY Times reporter and author of a best-selling expos√© on the alleged relationship between mercury and autism, Evidence of Harm. Columnist James St. James wrote the memoir Disco Bloodbath, later made into a 1998 documentary and a 2003 feature film starring Macaulay Culkin, both called Party Monster. Advertising executive Troy Masters founded the New York weekly Gay City News and became its publisher. Columnist Maria Maggenti is a highly regarded independent film director (The Incredibly True Adventures of 2 Girls in Love; Puccini for Beginners). Rotello himself became the first openly gay columnist for a major newspaper (Newsday), later authored the best selling book Sexual Ecology, and is now a TV documentary producer/director for HBO, Bravo and other networks.

The approach routes to the bridge carries Ohio State Route 872 (SR 872) on the Ohio side and the unsigned West Virginia Route 2 Spur on the West Virginia side. The bridge is also officially known as the Arch A. Moore Bridge, named after the former West Virginia governor Arch A. Moore, Jr.. Description The western approach to the bridge begins at a diamond interchange with Ohio State Route 7 in rural Mead Township, Belmont County, Ohio. North of the interchange, Township Road 533 but towards the bridge, the four-lane, divided SR 872 begins. The road curves to the east and has intersections with access roads (TR 533) to the former R.E. Burger Power Station. First, SR 872 passes over TR 533 and railroad lines before beginning the Moundsville Bridge itself. Near the north bank of the river, the bridge crosses the state line where SR 872 ends and WV 2 Spur begins. After passing the main span, the road begins descending into Moundsville passing over local streets and a railroad. WV 2 Spur ends at a signalized intersection with WV 2 (Lafayette Avenue) and 12th Street in the central business district of Moundsville. History The Dilles Bottom section of Mead Township and Moundsville had been connected by a toll ferry since 1951. Upon the completion of the bridge, the ferry was retired. Planning for the bridge has been ongoing since the late 1970s. Plans for the bridge began during the end of Arch Moore's term as governor but went into limbo due to a state moratorium on building projects at the time. Construction resumed on the bridge upon the announcement of shared funding from West Virginia, Ohio, and the federal government in 1977 by then-Governor Jay Rockefeller; construction was expected to be completed in 1980. By 1979, the Ohio access route was built but the bridge itself was not opened until August 15, 1986. The opening of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge, along with the Moundsville Bridge was thought to have reduced the amount of traffic, and thus tolls collected by the nearby Bellaire Bridge were reduced by 50 per-cent in 1987. Cultural references In the 2011 independent film Margin Call, a character played by Stanley Tucci boasts of designing a bridge between Moundsville and Dilles Bottom, Ohio in 1986.

Jacobson, who had earned an MA at California State University, Sacramento in 1951, wrote to Rosenthal after he published a paper in American Scientist about the effect of researchers' expectations on their subjects in psychological experiments. In the article he mentioned the possibility that a similar self-fulfilling prophecy might be at work between teachers and students. After they had started to correspond, Jacobson offered Rosenthal her assistance and they agreed to collaborate on a study at her school. The experimental design for this research was finalised when Rosenthal went to San Francisco to meet Jacobson for the first time in 1964. They published their findings in Psychological Reports, 1966, vol. 19. This led to the publication of Pygmalion in the Classroom in 1968. Seven years later Jacobson and Paul M.

Originally designed as an to attempt to create a repository of health records and data (personal health record services), in order to connect doctors, hospitals and pharmacies directly. The project was introduced in 2008 and discontinued in 2012. Starting in November 2018, Dr. David Feinberg was appointed lead. In 2019, it was announced they want more searchable medical records and to \\"improve the quality of health-focused search results across Google and YouTube\\". Google Health also appears to focus on health-related artificial intelligence research, clinical tools, and partnerships for other healthcare tools and services. History former Google Health beta logo Google Health 2008-2012 Google Health was the name given to a 2008‚Äì2012 version of a service allowed Google users to volunteer their health records‚Äîeither manually or by logging into their accounts at partnered health services providers‚Äîinto the Google Health system, thereby merging potentially separate health records into one centralized Google Health profile. Volunteered information could include \\"health conditions, medications, allergies, and lab results\\". Once entered, Google Health used the information to provide the user with a merged health record, information on conditions, and possible interactions between drugs, conditions, and allergies. Google Health's API was based on a subset of the Continuity of Care Record. The original Google Health was under development from mid-2006, under ex-chief health strategist Dr. Roni Zeiger. In 2008, the service underwent a two-month pilot test with 1,600 patients of The Cleveland Clinic. Starting on May 20, 2008, Google Health was released to the general public as a service in beta test stage. On September 15, 2010, Google updated Google Health with a new look and feel. On June 24, 2011, Google announced it was retiring Google Health on January 1, 2012; data was available for download through January 1, 2013. The reason Google gave for abandoning the project was the lack of widespread adoption. In 2012, Dr. Roni Zeiger left Google. Google Health 2018-current Google Health in 2018 was the name given to a team working within Google, rather than a service or application, following a similarly named web service in 2008‚Äì2012. In 2018, during a process codenamed \\"Tuscany,\\" teams across combined consolidated into the new Google Health group. This included artificial-intelligence research teams Google Brain and DeepMind, as well as health teams from Nest Labs, the connected-home company Google bought in 2014. Later in 2018, Google reorganized their healthcare efforts, and as a result DeepMind Health became part of Google Health. They began a non disclosed project called Project Nightingale, a partnership with Ascension, a large Catholic health care system in the United States. The project was headed by head Dr. David Feinberg, hired in November 2018 and his oversight includes Google Fit, health-oriented features in Google Search, G Suite for healthcare businesses, AI-based health research offerings, and Alphabet subsidiaries DeepMind Health, Verily, and Calico. At the 2019 HLTH health care conference, Feinberg announced Google Health is working on improvements with the search functions in electronic health records (EHR) and to improve health-related search results across their platforms. In 2020, there were four areas of focus: # Consumer tools : included work on search and maps to surface authoritative information # Clinician tools : in partnerships with doctors and clinicians # Imaging and diagnostics # Research group Google Health reportedly struck up deals to work with large health systems such as Ascension and Stanford Medicine, but talks with other major heath companies and organizations including CVS Health and the Gates Foundation had ‚Äúfallen apart along the way‚Äù. FitBit Acquisition In November 2019, Google announced plans to acquire FitBit. The company also said ‚ÄúFitbit health and wellness data will not be used for Google ads.‚Äù The European Data Protection Board voiced privacy concerns in February 2020 about mass aggregation of data. In August 2020, EU regulators announced plans for an anticompetition probe into the deal. 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic \\"A quarter of Google Health's life has been spent during the coronavirus pandemic, and it's helped focus its search ambitions, partnerships with health officials, and collaboration across the company,\\" chief health officer Dr. Karen DeSalvo said in August 2020. She described YouTube, Maps, Google Assistant, and Google search wanting to guide consumers on their healthcare experience, called the \\"Discovery to Action Pathway\\". This included searching for local testing sites, looking for doctors, and setting up an appointment. In April 2020, Julie Black, Director of Product Management for Google Health, announced virtual care entries on Google Maps for medical businesses. Searches for \\"immediate care\\" would also show widely-available virtual care platforms like Live Health Online, AmWell and Doctor on Demand. In August 2020, Google announced an partnership with and investment in AmWell, a telemedicine company. The two companies aim to use their technology capabilities for TeleHealthcare including artificial intelligence and collaboration tools. Google Cloud will also invest $100 million in Amwell. YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki announced efforts to connect people to trusted information about the coronavirus pandemic. This included a COVID-19 news shelf, with videos from health authorities and news organizations. YouTube also said they were consulting on an ongoing basis with health authorities like the WHO and local organizations like the CDC, the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, and India‚Äôs Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as well as expert medical and public health professionals, to design policies based on the latest science. YouTube updated its policies to prohibit content with harmful medical information, and removed over 200,000 videos for violating medical policies. At the same time, YouTube and other social media sites had been criticized by civil rights advocates and health experts. The Southern Poverty Law Center noted that hate groups and racist pundits had pushed misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic on mainstream social media platforms such as YouTube throughout the crisis, despite companies like YouTube‚Äôs parent company Google pledging to fight fake news about the virus. The SPLC pointed out that videos containing racist misinformation about COVID created by Jared Taylor of American Renaissance, a white supremacist organization, had been posted and disseminated on YouTube. The SPLC also noted that despite being banned from Twitter since 2018, American Renaissance‚Äôs YouTube channel and its 126,000 subscribers had remained, as of April 2020.  Personnel  As of February 2020, Google Health had more than 500 employees. As of 2020, Google Health's leadership team includes the following people: * Paul Muret ‚Äì VP, Product and Engineering, previously co-founder of Urchin Software (acquired by Google) * Julie Black, Director of Product Management. * Shashidhar (Shashi) Thakur ‚Äì VP, Engineering * Kristen Gil, COO, VP of BizOps, Business Finance Officer * Dr. Lily Peng ‚Äì Product Manager, Research * Dr. David Feinberg, VP and Head, previouisly CEO of Geisinger Health * Mike Pearson ‚Äì Chief of Staff * Dr. Michael Howell, Chief Clinical Strategist * Dr. Alvin Rajkomar ‚Äì Research Scientist * Dr. Alan Karthikesalingam, Research Lead, UK * Dr. Dominic King ‚Äì Director, UK lead * Greg Corrado, Distinguished Scientist * Afia Asamoah, Head of Legal, previously Senior Product Counsel at Verily Life Sciences * Linda Peters ‚Äì VP, Quality and Regulatory, previously EVP and Chief Regulatory Officer at Beckton Dickinson * Matt Klainer ‚Äì VP, Business Development, previously VP of Google's consumer communications products group * Dr. Robert Califf, Advisor, Clinical Policy and Strategy, former FDA Commissioner * Dr. Karen DeSalvo, Chief Health Officer, former United States Acting Assistant Secretary for Health and former National Coordinator for Health Information Technology * Jeff Dean, Senior Fellow, SVP of Google AI = Alumni = * Yoky Matsuoka*, home-health monitoring, former co-founder of Google X, previously Nest CTO * Virginia McFerran, formerly from UnitedHealth Group and managing partner at Optum Ventures * Michael MacDonnell, COO of Sensyne Health, formerly director of Global Deployment at Google Health, previously Director of Strategy at NHS England * Jessica Beegle, VP/GM Healthcare, Walgreens Boots Alliance, formerly Google Health and DeepMind Health global head of business development, previously Amazon Web Services global head of healthcare and life sciences partnerships. Partners The original Google Health (2008-2012), like many other Google products, was free to use for consumers. Unlike other Google services, however, Health contained no advertising. Google did not reveal how it planned to make money with the service, but a Wall Street Journal article said that Google \\"hasn't ruled [advertising] out for the future.\\" Google filed in 2007, U.S. Patent Application #20070282632, \\"Method and apparatus for serving advertisements in an electronic medical record system\\". Google Health (from 2008 to 2012) imported medical and/or drug prescription information from the following partners: Allscripts, Anvita Health, The Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, The Cleveland Clinic, CVS Caremark, Drugs.com, Healthgrades, Longs Drugs, Medco Health Solutions, Quest Diagnostics, RxAmerica, and Walgreens. In January 2010, the Withings WiFi Body scale enables Google Health users to seamlessly update their weight and other data to their online profiles. Users whose health records reside with other providers had to either manually enter their data or pay to have a Google Health partner perform the service. MediConnect Global was one such partner; for a fee, they would retrieve a user's medical records from around the world and add them to his or her profile. In 2009, in response to demand for added convenience, Google Health began establishing relationships with tele-health providers that will allow their users to sync the data shared during tele-health consultations with their online health records partnerships have been formed with the following companies: MDLiveCare and Hello Health. Privacy concerns = Google Health (2008‚Äì2012) = The original Google Health was an opt-in service, meaning it could only access medical information volunteered by individuals. It did not retrieve any part of a person's medical records without his or her explicit consent and action. However, it did encourage users to set up profiles for other individuals. According to its Terms of Service, Google Health is not considered a \\"covered entity\\" under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996; thus, HIPAA privacy laws do not apply to it. In a 2008 article covering the original Google Health's launch, the New York Times discussed privacy issues and said that \\"patients apparently did not shun the Google health records because of qualms that their personal health information might not be secure if held by a large technology company.\\" Others contend that Google Health may be more private than the current \\"paper\\" health record system because of reduced human interaction. = Google Health (2018‚Äìcurrent) = DeepMind Health and NHS In 2017, DeepMind Health (later a division of Google Health) was found to have not complied with UK data protection laws, according to the UK Information Commissioner‚Äôs Office. The health unit of DeepMind had been formed in early 2016. DeepMind acquired a task management app called Hark developed by Dr. Dominic King and Dr. Lord Ara Darzi at Imperial College. Deepmind Health was also developing an app with the NHS Royal Free Hospital called Streams that helped monitor patients with acute kidney injury. The ICO said that patients were not notified correctly about how their data was being used. The DeepMind Health team noted the appointment of Dr. David Feinberg at Google in November 2018, and later officially joined Google Health in late 2019. Google Health and University of Chicago In June 2019, University of Chicago, its medical center, and Google were sued in a potential class-action lawsuit about patient record sharing. A federal judge dismissed the patient data privacy lawsuit on September 4, 2020. The class action suit had been filed by plaintiff Matt Dinerstein and represented by attorney Jay Edelson. The University noted that class action attorney Edelson had a potential conflict of interest, as an investor in a competing company, Quant HC. According to a legal motion filed in 2019, Edelson and his law partners allegedly ‚Äúfunded, organized, and served as officers and directors of‚Äù Quant HC, a company founded by Edelson‚Äôs spouse, a physician at University of Chicago. Quant HC, produced medical software called ECART, and received $600,000 of initial investment from Edelson and his wife from its founding in 2012. Google Health and Ascension Health In 2018, Project Nightingale started the partnership with Ascension, one of the largest United States health care systems. Ascension health system and Google described the partnership including infrastructure modernization, transitioning to productivity and collaboration tools, and exploring artificial intelligence / machine learning applications and tools for doctors and nurses. In November 2019, Google engineers were reported to have had access to medical records held by Ascension as they were building products and as a result, the US government opened up an investigation on the partnership. From December 2019 to March 2020, a group of U.S. Senators asked for more information about the project, and how sensitive health information was protected. Legal observers, however, had noted that there had probably not actually been any HIPAA federal privacy law violations, citing a business associate agreement between Google and Ascension in line with what HIPAA allowed. Other health data experts commented that companies such as IQVIA, UnitedHealth Optum Labs, and Symphony Health, IBM Watson Health (Truven Health) ‚Äúreap the profits of selling the healthcare data while the people from whom it's collected have no control over how it's used. Nor do they get any compensation for it.‚Äù For example, IQVIA, a large pharmaceutical research and marketing conglomerate noted that they have data on over 600 million patients in their public 10-K financial filings. Other media coverage noted that while Google had done nothing illegal, questions remained on what other uses Google intended. Google executive Tariq Shaukat wrote in an official statement that the data would be used in extending tools to doctors and nurses to improve care, writing: ‚ÄúWe aim to provide tools that Ascension could use to support improvements in clinical quality and patient safety.‚Äù The official post was later amended to clarify that Ascension patient data would not be combined with Google consumer data, stating ‚ÄúIn accordance with HIPAA and the BAA we sign with our customers, patient data cannot be used for any other purpose than for provisioning the tools specific to the customer.‚Äú Comparison to Facebook Hospital Data Projects The stated commitment by Google to not combine data stood in contrast to the health records activities by Facebook. While Google noted they would not combine health data with consumer data, Facebook had reportedly sought to combine hashed electronic health record data with consumer data. The secretive Facebook ‚ÄúBuilding 8‚Äù project, led by cardiologist Dr. Freddy Abnousi, sought to ‚Äúcombine what a health system knows about its patients (such as: person has heart disease, is age 50, takes 2 medications and made 3 trips to the hospital this year) with what Facebook knows (such as: user is age 50, married with 3 kids, English isn't a primary language, actively engages with the community by sending a lot of messages).‚Äù FitBit Acquisition and the European Commission In August 2020, as Google began acquisition of FitBit, the European Commission began investigating Google's potential uses of data collected from Fitbit's health tracking hardware.. The Commission expressed concerns about competition, the effects of combining data from FitBit and Google in the digital healthcare sector, and potential effects of interoperability of rivals' wearables with Google's Android operating system for smartphones. Competitors and related companies Google's parent company Alphabet, Inc. has also been active in the healthcare industry with the companies Verily, Calico, and DeepMind. In July 2020, sister company Verily was described as acting \\"largely independent of one another\\", while Verily CEO Andrew Conrad reportedly wanted to end the \\"rivalry\\" between the two companies and collaborate more closely. On December 7, 2011, MediConnect Global announced a similar capability that allows displaced Google Health users to transfer their personal health records to a MyMediConnect account. Google Health was a personal health record (PHR) service with numerous competitors, including other proprietary PHR systems and open-source such as Microsoft's HealthVault, Dossia, and the open-source Indivo project. The article shows a simple timeline or pedigree of the Personally Controlled Health Record. In the United States hospital market for electronic health records (EHR) in 2018, Epic, Cerner, MEDITECH, and CSPI (Evident Thrive) had the top market share at 28%, 26%, 9%, and 6%. For large hospitals with over 500 beds, Epic and Cerner had over 85% market share in 2019. = Microsoft = On July 18, 2011, Microsoft released a tool that lets Google Health customers transfer their personal health information to a web-based Microsoft HealthVault account. HealthVault had partnered with American Heart Association, Johnson & Johnson, and Allscripts. In November 2019, Microsoft HealthVault was shut down and it was suggested users migrate their records to Get Real Health and FollowMyHealth. = Health (Apple) = In 2014, Health (Apple) a health informatics mobile application was announced. HealthKit is the accompanying developer application programming interface (API). = Facebook = In 2019, Dr. Roni Zeiger announced he would be joining Facebook as the Head of Health Strategy. The same year in 2019, Facebook announced its project called Preventive Health, a digital tool to connect patients with healthcare providers and sends reminders for health concerns based on age and gender. In 2017, Facebook had been working on a \\"top-secret\\" project headed by Dr. Freddy Abnousi to take anonymous medical data and using a common computer science cryptographic technique called ‚Äúhashing‚Äù in order to match individuals. Alleged this information would only be used for the medical research community. Additionally there had been the idea of building virtual profiles of patients that included their medical conditions, as well as their social and economic factors. = Amazon = Since 2018, Amazon is in a joint venture, Haven, with JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway, to created a new type of health insurance. In 2019, Amazon launched a beta program as an extension of a traditional health insurance plan called, Amazon Care, offering both virtual and in-person healthcare. They have tele-medicine via an app, chat and remote video, as well as follow-up visits and prescription drug delivery via home or office.

The airport was dedicated as Lansdowne Field in late October 1926. It was named for Lieutenant Commander Zachary Lansdowne, an Ohio native and commander of the US Navy airship USS Shenandoah (ZR-1), which crashed in Ava, Ohio in 1925. Rear Admiral William A.

Modified to carry Kaiten manned torpedoes, she damaged two enemy destroyers with them, but her most significant success was , sunk with conventional torpedoes on 30 July 1945. The submarine surrendered in September 1945, and was later scuttled by the United States Navy. Service history The submarine was laid down on 26 December 1942 at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, and launched on 30 June 1943. During construction her 14 cm/40 11th Year Type naval gunCampbell, John Naval Weapons of World War Two p.191 was removed, making room for four Kaiten manned suicide torpedoes. The submarine was completed on 7 September 1944 and command was given to Kaigun Sh≈çsa (Lieutenant Commander) Mochitsura Hashimoto. I-58 was assigned to the Sixth Fleet's Submarine Squadron 11 for training in the Inland Sea before being assigned to the 15th Submarine Division on 4 December 1944. A few days later she was assigned to the Kongo (\\"Diamond\\") group, with I-36, I-47, I-48, I-53 and I-56, to launch Kaiten attacks on five U.S. fleet anchorages. I-58 was assigned to attack Apra Harbor, Guam. =Attack on Guam= After a week of exercises I-58 took on fuel, provisions and torpedoes, and embarked four Kaiten and their crews, before departing Kure with I-36 on 31 December 1944. Between 03:10 and 03:27 on 12 January 1945, west of Apra, she launched all four Kaiten. The last Kaiten detonated immediately after launching, but at 05:30, as I-58 was leaving the area, she observed two pillars of smoke. She arrived back at Kure on 22 January 1945 and was credited with sinking an escort carrier and a large oiler, but the attack was not successful. =Operation Tan No. 2= After the American invasion of Iwo Jima in February 1945, I-58 and I-36 joined the Shimbu group formed to counterattack American forces. She departed Kure on 1 March carrying four Kaiten. On the 7th the operation was cancelled, and two days later she was redirected to the area west of Okinotorishima to support Operation Tan No. 2, an air attack on the anchorage at Ulithi. The submarine jettisoned two Kaiten and proceeded at full speed. On 11 March I-58 was stationed off Okinotorishima to act as a radio relay ship for 24 Yokosuka P1Y \\"Frances\\" twin-engined kamikaze bombers. Only six aircraft reached Ulithi, and one crashed into the aircraft carrier . =Operation Ten-Go= After returning to Kure for further training, I-58 was attached to the Tatara group, with I-44, I-47 and I-56, formed to attack American shipping anchored off Okinawa as part of Operation Ten-Go. I-58 was unable to penetrate the intense U.S. anti-submarine defences, and was forced to return to Kyushu on 10 April to recharge batteries. She made another attempt, but repeated attacks by enemy aircraft made any attack impossible. The submarine was ordered to an area between Okinawa and Guam on the 14th, but had no success. The operation was cancelled on the 17th, and I-58 returned to Kure on the 30th. In May 1945 the submarine was sent to Kure Navy Yard to refit. Her aircraft catapult and hangar were removed, enabling her to carry six Kaiten. She was also fitted with a snorkel. On 22 June 162 B-29s of the U.S. Twentieth Air Force bombed Kure. I-58 was undamaged, although there were several near-misses. =Attack on Wild Hunter and Lowry= I-58 was then attached to the Tamon group with I-47, I-53, I-363, I-366 and I-367, and on the evening of 18 July she sailed for an area east of the Philippines. On 28 July, 300 miles north of Palau, I-58 sighted the 6,214-ton cargo ship Wild Hunter, escorted by the destroyer . Two Kaiten were launched, but Wild Hunter sighted a periscope, opened fire with her 3-inch gun, and the periscope disappeared. Lowry rammed and sank the other Kaiten, receiving minor damage. Aboard I-58, two explosions were heard, but a rain squall prevented any visual verification. The submarine eventually surfaced, but detected no ships on radar, and reported both as sunk. =Sinking of Indianapolis= At 23:00 on 29 July 1945 I-58 surfaced north of Palau and headed south. Shortly afterwards the navigation officer Lt. Tanaka spotted a ship approaching from the east, making and not zigzagging. Lt. Cdr. Hashimoto incorrectly identified the target as an Idaho-class battleship. She was in fact the heavy cruiser , and had sailed from Guam for Leyte the previous day, after having delivered parts and nuclear material for the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs to Tinian from San Francisco. Indianapolis was not equipped with sonar or hydrophones, or provided with an escort. I-58 submerged and prepared to attack with Type 95 torpedoes. After manoeuvering into position, at 23:26 (JST) the submarine fired a spread of six torpedoes at 2-second intervals. At 23:35, Lt. Cdr Hashimoto observed two equally spaced hits on the cruiser's starboard side. The ship stopped, listed to starboard, and was down by the bow, but Hashimoto decided to attack again and dived to to open the range and reload torpedo tubes. While the submarine was submerged, at 00:27 on 30 July, Indianapolis capsized and sank at . When I-58 made a periscope check, the target was gone. The submarine surfaced, and departed the area at full speed, heading north while recharging batteries. =Attack on Task Group 75.19= On the morning of 9 August, 260 miles north east of Aparri, Luzon, I-58 sighted a zigzagging \\"convoy of ten transports\\" escorted by three destroyers, and Kaiten No.'s 4 and 5 were launched. In fact the \\"convoy\\" was the hunter-killer team Task Group 75.19 led by the escort carrier , carrying out anti-submarine sweeps between Leyte and Okinawa. The destroyer escort sighted and attacked Kaiten No.5 with her guns, and then attacked Kaiten No.4 with depth charges. Kaiten No.5 was sunk by fire from her 5-inch stern gun. Kaiten No.4 sighted again over an hour later and again attacked with depth charges which resulted in a violent explosion, throwing water into the air. I-58 came to periscope depth after her hydrophones reported a distant explosion. In Hashimoto's opinion, the previously sighted destroyer had disappeared. He headed northwards to evade pursuit. The crew of Johnnie Hutchins were later awarded the Navy Unit Commendation. =Attack on Oak Hill and Thomas F. Nickel= Sasebo in 1946 just before the submarine was scuttled. Around 17:00 on 12 August 1945, 360 miles south-east of Okinawa, while I-58 was running northwards on the surface at , her Type 3 radar detected multiple targets. Soon after ships were sighted on the horizon. The submarine dived, and at 17:16, the crew sighted what they believed to be a seaplane carrier escorted by a destroyer. In reality, the \\"seaplane carrier\\" was the dock landing ship , escorted by en route from Okinawa to Leyte. At 18:26, Oak Hill sighted a periscope, and Nickel attacked at flank speed. Nickel fired depth charges, and attempted to ram, sustaining minor damage to her hull. A Kaiten broke surface astern of Oak Hill and exploded. Half an hour later Nickel sighted another periscope astern of Oak Hill, and fired depth charges. An explosion followed, throwing a black geyser of oil and water into the air. An oil slick was also sighted. =The end of the war= On 18 August I-58, arrived back at Kure. On 2 September Japan surrendered. On 1 April 1946 in \\"Operation Road's End\\" I-58, stripped of all usable equipment and material, was towed from Sasebo to an area off the Got≈ç Islands by the submarine tender and scuttled at . =Wreck discovery= On 25 May 2017, sonar images revealed the nearly -long section of the submarine, vertically on the seafloor deep. Plans called for a submersible to be deployed to confirm identity. The submarine, heavily encrusted with marine life, was positively identified as I-58 on 7 September 2017, by its rudder.

He is the president and founder of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito, California and a Clinical Professor of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. The author of Dr. Dean Ornish's Program for Reversing Heart Disease, Eat More, Weigh Less and The Spectrum, he is a well-known advocate for using diet and lifestyle changes to treat and prevent heart disease.  Personal background  Ornish, a native of Dallas, Texas, is a graduate of Dallas's Hillcrest High School. He holds a Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude in Humanities from the University of Texas at Austin, where he gave the baccalaureate address. He earned his MD from the Baylor College of Medicine, completed a medical internship and residency at Massachusetts General Hospital (1981‚Äì1984), and was a Clinical Fellow in Medicine at Harvard Medical School.  Professional background  Ornish is known for his lifestyle-driven approach to the control of coronary artery disease (CAD) and other chronic diseases. He promotes lifestyle changes including a quasi whole foods, plant-based diet,Philip J Tuso, MD; Mohamed H Ismail, MD; Benjamin P Ha, MD; Carole Bartolotto, MA, RD. \\"Nutritional Update for Physicians: Plant-Based Diets.\\" The Permanente Journal (Kaiser Permanente). 2013 Spring; 17(2):61‚Äì66. smoking cessation, moderate exercise, stress management techniques including yoga and meditation, and psychosocial support. Ornish does not follow a strict vegetarian diet and recommends fish oil supplements; the program additionally allows for the occasional consumption of other animal products. From the 1970s through the 1990s, Ornish and others researched the impact of diet and stress levels on people with heart disease. The research, published in peer-reviewed journals, became the basis of his \\"Program for Reversing Heart Disease.\\" It combined diet, meditation, exercise and support groups, and in 1993 became the first non- surgical, non-pharmaceutical therapy for heart disease to qualify for insurance reimbursement. With the exception of chiropractic care, it was the first alternative medical technique, not taught in traditional medical-school curricula, to gain approval by a major insurance carrier. Ornish worked with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for 16 years to create a new coverage category called intensive cardiac rehabilitation (ICR), which focuses on comprehensive lifestyle changes. In 2010, Medicare began to reimburse costs for Ornish's Program for Reversing Heart Disease, a 72-hour ICR for people who have had heart attacks, chest pain, heart valve repair, coronary artery bypass, heart or lung bypass, or coronary angioplasty or stenting. In addition to the Ornish program, Medicare and Medicaid pay for ICR programs created by the Pritikin Longevity Center and by the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. Ornish has been a physician consultant to former President Bill Clinton since 1993, when Ornish was first asked by Hillary Clinton to consult with the chefs at The White House, Camp David, and Air Force One. In 2010, after the former President's cardiac bypass grafts became clogged, Clinton, encouraged by Ornish, followed a mostly plant- based diet.Sherwell, Philip. \\"Bill Clinton's new diet: nothing but beans, vegetables and fruit to combat heart disease\\", The Daily Telegraph, October 3, 2010. In 2011, Barack Obama appointed Ornish to the Advisory Group on Prevention, Health Promotion, and Integrative and Public Health. Controversy The Ornish diet has been described as a high-carbohydrate low- fat fad diet.Ayers, Suzan F; Sariscsany, Mary Jo. (2011). Physical Education for Lifelong Fitness: The Physical Best Teacher's Guide. National Association for Sport and Physical Education. p. 65. In 2008, The Gale Encyclopedia of Diets noted potential risks of the Ornish diet: In March 2015, The New York Times published \\"The Myth of High-Protein Diets,\\" an article by Ornish critical of diets high in animal fats and proteins. Science and health writer Melinda Wenner Moyer responded to Ornish in Scientific American; in it, she criticized Ornish's research and dietary recommendations, saying he used what she considered to be misleading statistics. Her article elicited a lengthy response from Ornish, who defended his position by citing a number of research studies, saying that she was mistaken regarding the statistics he had cited, and identifying serious flaws in the studies she said conflicted with his claims. In reply, Moyer wrote another article critical of Ornish's arguments, concluding: \\"Ornish‚Äôs diet would probably be an improvement on the current American diet‚Äîif people could actually follow it long-term. But his claims about the dangers of saturated fat and red meat go beyond the science and in some cases contradict it.\\" Bibliography *Dr. Dean Ornish's Program for Reversing Heart Disease New York: Random House, 1990; Ballantine Books, 1992. *Eat More, Weigh Less New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1993, *Everyday Cooking with Dr. Dean Ornish New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1996, *Love & Survival: The Scientific Basis for the Healing Power of Intimacy New York: HarperCollins, 1998. *The Spectrum New York: Ballantine Books, 2008. *UnDo It! with Anne Ornish.

The name is most commonly derived from the [classical Arabic] ‚ÄòIsa, an Arabic translation of Jesus, itself having a Hebrew origin. However, it is not the only translation; it is most commonly associated with Jesus as depicted in Islam, and thus, commonly used by Muslims. Meanwhile, Arabic-speaking Christians usually use Yas≈´‚Äò, which comes from Ye≈°≈´‚Äò, the Aramaic name for Jesus, although they use the name Isa too. The origin of the Qur'anic Isa is complex and is detailed below. Isa was also used in the Frisian (Old Germanic) language for both males and females and was a short form of Germanic names beginning with the element \\"is\\", meaning ice and iron. Etymology The English form of the name \\"Jesus\\" is derived from the Latin Iƒìsus, which in turn comes from the Greek (Iƒìso√ªs). The Greek is a Hellenized form of the Hebrew name Yƒì≈°ua (), which is in turn a shortened form of Hebrew Yeh≈ç≈°ua () or \\"Joshua\\" in English. Aramaic (Classical Syriac) and East Syriac, which are ancestral to West Syriac, render the pronunciation of the same letters as ‹ù‹´‹ò‹• isho ï (i≈°o ï) /i Éo ï/. The Aramaic Bible (c. 200 AD) or the Peshitta preserve this same spelling. The Encyclopedia of the Qur'an by Brill Publishers quotes scholarship that notes that the Greek name Iesous, (Iƒìso√ªs), also is known to have represented many different Biblical Hebrew names (which causes issues when seeking to find what Jesus' original Hebrew name would have been from the Greek) \\"Josephus used the Greek name lesous to denote three people mentioned in the Bible whose Hebrew names were not Yeshua', Y'hoshua' or Y'hoshua'. They were Saul's son Yishwi (Anglicized as 'Ishvi' in the RSV of I Samuel 14:49), the Levite Abishua' (mentioned in I Chronicles 6:4, etc.) and Yishwah the son of Asher (Anglicized as 'Ishva' in the RSV of Genesis 46:17). ... Josephus furnishes important evidence for the wide variety of Hebrew names represented in Greek by Iesous.\\" Also, the classical theologians Clement of Alexandria and Cyril of Jerusalem both stated that the Greek name Iesous was allegedly Jesus' original name itself and that the name was not a transliteration of a Hebrew form. There is a major discrepancy between the Hebrew/Aramaic and Muslim Arabic forms of this name, since the Hebrew form of this name has the voiced pharyngeal  øAyin or  øAyn consonant at the end of the name (as does Christian Arabic yas≈´ ø), while the Muslim Arabic form  øƒ´sƒÅ has the  øAyn at the beginning of the name. For this reason, some (such as Ahmed Deedat) state the Arabic name Isa is related to the Biblical name Esau (which begins with a pharyngeal); it is also similar in the vowels to an Aramaic version of Jesus, viz. Eesho ø (Aramaic forms of the name, however, still have the voiced pharyngeal \`Ayn consonant at the end of the name). [Other Aramaic pronunciations of the same name include yeshuu ï ( ï is IPA ayin). Vowels in Semitic languages are somewhat fluid between dialects while consonants are structurally more stable. The vowels in an Anglicized quote \\"Eesho\`\\" by themselves are insignificant for this discussion since \\"i\\" and \\"e\\" and short \\"a\\" can interchange between dialects, and \\"u\\" and \\"o\\" can also interchange between dialects. The dominant consonsonantal discrepancy remains, between Aramaic yeshuu ï [consonantal y-sh-w- ï] and Arabic  ïiisa [consonantal  ï-y-s-alef].] Scholars have been puzzled by the use of  øƒ™sƒÅ in the Qur'an since Christians in Arabia used yas≈´ ø before and after Islam, itself derived from the Syriac form Yƒìsh≈´a ø by a phonetic change. The Encyclopedia of the Qur'an by Brill Publishers states this has also come about because many Western scholars have held a \\"conviction that Jesus' authentic Hebrew name is Yeshua'\\" and because of this they often \\"have been puzzled by the Qur'an's reference to him as 'Isa\\". Brill's Encyclopedia of the Qur'an further states \\"It is not certain that Jesus' original name was Yeshua'\\" However, the early Syriac/Aramaic form of the name Yeshua, the etymological link with 'salvation' (note the Hebrew consonantal root y-sh-\`) in Matthew 1:21, all of the correspondences of in the Greek OT and Second Temple Jewish writings, and the common attestation of Yeshua among 1st century Jewish names have led to a consensus among scholars of the gospels that Yeshua was \\"Jesus\\"'s original name. \\"Esau\\" (and derivatives with \`ayin as a first letter) is not a realistic possibility. With all this in mind, some scholars have proposed a number of explanations. James A. Bellamy of the University of Michigan suggested that the Qur'anic name is a corruption of Masƒ´·∏• itself derived from yas≈´ ø, suggesting that this resulted from a copyist error and an attempt to conceal the Arabic verb sƒÅ øa/yas≈´ øu which has obscene connotations. Josef Horovitz on the other hand holds that the Qur'anic form is meant to parallel M≈´sƒÅ (Moses). Similar pairs are also frequently found in the Quran as well which supports this theory. For example, compare IsmƒÅ‚Äòƒ´l and IbrƒÅhƒ´m (Ishmael and Abraham) or JƒÅl≈´t and TƒÅl≈´t (Goliath and Saul). It is thus possible that the Arabs referred to him as Yasa ø, but the Quran reversed the letters so as to parallel M≈´sƒÅ. Another explanation given is that in ancient Mesopotamia divine names were written in one way and pronounced in another. Thus it is possible for borrowed words to have their consonants reversed. Another explanation is that Muhammad adopted Isa from the polemical Jewish form Esau. However, there is no evidence that the Jews have ever used Esau to refer to Jesus, and if Muhammad had unwittingly adopted a pejorative form his many Christian acquaintances would have corrected him. A fourth explanation is that prior to the rise of Islam, Christian Arabs had already adopted this form from Syriac. According to the Encyclopaedia of the Qur ºƒÅn, \\"Arabic often employs an initial 'ayn in words borrowed from Aramaic or Syriac and the dropping of the final Hebrew 'ayin is evidenced in the form Yisho of the 'koktiirkish' Manichaean fragments from Turfan.\\"Encyclopaedia of the Qur ºƒÅn Volume 3 General Editor: Jane Dammen McAuliffe (Georgetown University, Washington DC). Brill Academic, 2003, pp. 8-10 This is supported by Mac√∫ch with an example in classical Mandaic, a variety of Eastern Aramaic (hence closely related to Syriac) used as liturgical language by the Mandaean community of southern Mesopotamia, where the name for Jesus is rendered  ø-≈°-u (‡°è‡°î‡°Ö), though the pharyngeal ('ayin) is pronounced like a regular long i (\\"ƒ™shu\\"). Also the name Yeshu (◊ô◊©◊ï in Hebrew and Aramaic) lacking the final 'ayin is also used to refer to Jesus in the Jewish work the Toledot Yeshu, and scholar David Flusser presents evidence Yeshu was also a name itself rather than claims it was meant to supposedly be an acronym to insult Jesus. The Brill Encyclopedia of the Qur'an notes scholar Anis al-Assiouty as noting the fact that \\"In the Talmud, however, he (Jesus) is called Yeshu.\\" Scholar David Flusser and other scholars like Adolf Neubauer, Hugh J. Schonfield, and Joachim Jeremias also further argued that the name or pronunciation Yeshu (◊ô◊©◊ï in Hebrew and Aramaic) could also be \\"the Galilean pronunciation\\" of Yeshua' that came about because of an inability to pronounce the 'ayin in the Galilee region where Jesus came from. Scholar Alphonse Mingana writes there may have been a monastery named  øƒ™sƒÅniyya in the territory of the Christian Ghassanid Arabs in southern Syria as early as 571 CE.fol. 84b of the Brit. Mus. Syr. MS. Add., 14, 602http://www.muhammadanism.org/Quran/syriac_influence_quran.pdf Christoph Luxenberg's The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran equates the Qur'anic name with Hebrew Jesse. However, neither Yeshu nor Jesse begins with a pharyngeal consonant in their original Hebrew forms. The earliest archaeological evidence of an Arabic name for Jesus is a Jordanian inscription. Enno Littman (1950) states: \\"Mr. G. Lankaster Harding, Chief Curator of Antiquities Hashimite Kingdom of Jordan, kindly sent me copies of a little more than five hundred Thamudic inscriptions. [...] It is the inscription [Harding No. 476] that interests us here. [...] Below the circle there are four letters: a y, a sh, a  ø, and again a y.\\" He also states: \\"These letters are so placed that they can be read from right to left or from left to right y-sh- ø, probably pronounced Yasha ø, and this name is the same as Yashua ø, the Hebrew form of the name of Christ.\\"\\"Jesus in a Pre-Islamic Arabic Inscription\\", Muslim World, (1950, vol. xi) p. 16.] An archaic Arabic root for 'Salvation' exists in Yatha, which may have later formed this name: y-sh- ø.Cooper, William. An Archaic Dictionary. Bagster, 1876, p. 623. The lack of a Waw is still unexplained. Also, the closer correspondence with another name [y'sha'y√°, \\"Isaiah\\" in English] needs explanation or discussion before this inscription can be entertained as an Arabic \\"Jesus\\". Non-Islamic uses  øƒ™sƒÅ is used as well by several Christian groups in Muslim countries. A 14th- century Persian translation of Matthew, one of the earliest surviving Persian manuscripts of the scripture, uses  øƒ™sƒÅ. Later translations in other languages also follow suit. Some modern Evangelical translations also use Isa, such as David Owen's Life of Christ (Arabic 1987).Ivor Mark Beaumont Christology in Dialogue with Muslims: A Critical Analysis of Christian Presentations of Christ for Muslims from the Ninth and Twentieth Centuries. Oxford: Regnum Books International, 2005 - Page 175 \\"language is used in the translation in an unprecedented way.3 For example, the use of the Qur'anic name Isa for Jesus in The Life of Christ is a startling innovation for Christian Arabic writing, where the ancient Syriac Yasu'a is normally found.[Correction: the ancient Syriac was Yeshu\`, the form Yasu'a (sic) is an Arabic modification of the Syriac name.] Nicolas Notovitch's 1894 book Life of Saint Issa claims that during his unknown years, Jesus (ƒ´≈õa meaning 'the Lord' in Sanskrit) left Galilee for India and studied with Buddhists and Hindus there before returning to Judea.

In 2010 CNN referred to Letta as \\"Berlusconi's right-hand man.\\" Among Letta's duties for Berlusconi include co-ordinating the Italian government's activities with the Holy See. Gianni is an extremely close associate of Berlusconi, and was the best man at Berlusconi's wedding to Veronica Lario at the Palazzo Marino in 1990. In 2006, Berlusconi nominated him as the House of Freedoms candidate to succeed Carlo Azeglio Ciampi as President of the Italian Republic. In the first ballot held on 8 May 2006, he received 369 votes, not enough to be elected. He received the votes from the right-wing coalition but he was soundly refused by the majority of the house, L'Unione, for being considered as the factotum of Silvio Berlusconi. The election was won by Giorgio Napolitano, the candidate of L'Unione, on May 10, 2006.

At Cambridge, the Registrary is also Secretary to the University Council. As the head of the university's Unified Administrative Service, the Registrary is responsible for the central management and the non-academic services of the university. The Registrary has control of the University Chest (formerly a physical chest in which the funds of the university were held secure, now a metaphor for the university's bank accounts). The actual chest is still kept in the Registrary's office. It is over 600 years old and is locked with 17 locks. The previous chest was burned in the Cambridge Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Until the 14th century, the university's books were also kept in the chest. The office of the Registrary was established in 1506, to compile and maintain the records of the university. The office has been held by only 26 persons in continuous succession since that date. Many early registraries held, or had held, the office of Esquire Bedell.

It later formed two battalions of the Royal Scots, which fought in World War I at Gallipoli, in Palestine and on the Western Front. The two battalions combined between the world wars before being converted into an air defence regiment of the Royal Artillery (RA). This served in Anti-Aircraft Command during World War II and continued in the postwar Territorial Army (TA) until 1961, when its successors were converted into Royal Engineers (RE). Volunteer Force The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Grierson, pp. 1‚Äì12.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì8. The 1st City of Edinburgh RVC comprised 21 different companies raised in that city between 31 August 1859 and November 1860 under the command of James Moncrieff, MP for Edinburgh (later 1st Lord Moncrieff), as Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant. Nine of these companies were professional by background (lawyers, accountants, cvil servants, university men and merchants), four were drawn from miscellaneous interests (Freemasons, Total abstainers, the Highland Society of Edinburgh), two were citizens' companies, two were lower middle class (tailors and bankers' clerks) and four were artisan companies:Beckett, pp. 59‚Äì60.Beckett, Appendix VII.Frederick, p. 299.Grierson, pp. 12‚Äì4, 177‚Äì84.Westlake, Rifle Volunteers, pp. 78‚Äì81.QER at Scottish Military Articles.J.T.

M. Ballantyne was appointed Ensign in No 13 (4th Artisans) Company, and then promoted to be Captain of No 9 (2nd Artisans) Company in July 1860, resigning in July 1863. He rejoined the corps in 1867 as Captain of No 15 (1st Merchants) Company, but resigned again at the end of 1869. His brother John was one of the first officers appointed to the corps, being commissioned as ensign in No 2 (1st Citizens) Company and then selected as Captain of No 14 (2nd Citizens) Company on its formation, before resigning in June 1860.J.T. Thomson, 'R.M. and J. Ballantyne and the Edinburgh Rifle Volunteer Corps', Soldiers of the Queen, No 56/57, June 1989. The first six companies were self-supporting, the members paying for their own uniforms, equipment and arms, while No 7 Company composed of bank clerks, No 15 (1st Merchants) and No 19, mainly tailors, received financial support from their employers. The other artisans paid for their uniforms by instalments and their company expenses were met by public subscriptions. The three Highland Companies came from the Highland Society of Edinburgh. Interest in No 12 Company, the Freemasons, soon fell away and by 1861 it had almost ceased to exist. The novelist Catherine Sinclair came forward with funds and No 12 Company was reorganised, recruited mainly from the Water of Leith district. In 1865 the unit received the title of 1st Queen's Edinburgh Rifle Volunteer Brigade (1st QERVB). A 2nd City of Edinburgh RVC had been formed in 1862 as one company of Highlanders raised from W.D. Young's Ironworks at Fountainbridge with William D. Young himself as captain. On 23 February 1867 this unit was increased to three companies, but simultaneously was included in the 1st QERVB as the 4th, 5th and 6th (Highland) Companies. No 16 Company had been formed by John Hope entirely from men who had 'signed the pledge' as total abstainers. Hope then decided to raise a complete corps of abstainers from Edinburgh and on 27 May 1867 the 3rd City of Edinburgh RVC of two companies was formed with Hope in command. Most of his recruits (and the cap badge) were taken from No 16 Company, and the 3rd RVC remained administratively attached to the 1st QERVB for several years. The unit, known locally as 'John Hope's Water Rats', grew to six companies by 1880, when it was renumbered as the 2nd Edinburgh RVC. It became the 4th Volunteer Battalion of the Royal Scots in 1888, and the 6th Battalion, Royal Scots in 1908.Grierson, pp. 185‚Äì6.Army List, various dates. The QER Drill Hall at Forrest Hill. The 1st QERVB continued to grow, adding a 7th (Highland) Company on 27 December 1867 from natives of Caithness living in Edinburgh. Nos 1 and 3 Companies were disbanded in 1868 but on 19 March 1869 a new No 20 Company was formed and the brigade divided into two battalions: 1st Battalion comprised Nos 2, 4, 5. 6, 7, 10, 18 and 1st to 7th Highland Companies; 2nd Battalion comprised Nos 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 and 20 Companies. It was the largest RVC in the Volunteer Force. The unit established its Headquarters (HQ) at Forrest Hill drill hall, Edinburgh, in 1872, and enlarged the building in 1905. In common with other Edibugh Volunteer units, it used a rifle range at Hunters Bog in Holyrood Park. J.H.A. Macdonald, later Lord Kingsburgh, Lord Advocate of Scotland, was commissioned as a Lt-Col in the brigade in 1864 and became Lt-Col Commandant in 1882. He was one of the leading Volunteer advocates of drill reform, author of On the Best Detail Formation for the New Infantry Tactics (1873) and Commonsense on Parade or Drill without Strings (1886). In 1885 he organised a spectacular night assembly of the brigade, which resulted in 500 new recruits. In 1886 a Mounted Infantry detachment was formed and an affiliated cadet corps was formed at Merchiston Castle School.Beckett, p. 198; Appendix VI. =Localisation= Under the 'Localisation of Forces' scheme introduced in 1872 by the Cardwell Reforms, the 1st QERVB was grouped with the 1st Regiment of Foot (the Royal Scots), the Edinburgh Light Infantry Militia and a number of RVCs from neighbouring counties into Brigade No 62. When these were combined into a single regiment under the Childers Reforms, the 1st QERVB provided two Volunteer Battalions of the Royal Scots from 1 July 1881. The 2nd Battalion formed a Mounted Rifle company in March 1886. On 1 April the unit was designated the Queens Rifle Volunteer Brigade Royal Scots, when it was split into three battalions: 1st Battalion with A-I Companies (previously Nos 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 18 and 1‚Äì3 Highland); 2nd Battalion A‚ÄìH Companies (previously Nos 8, 9, 11‚Äì16); 3rd Battalion A‚ÄìH Companies (previously Nos 4, 17, 19, 20 and 4‚Äì7 Highland). The Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 introduced a Mobilisation Scheme for Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training.Beckett, pp. 135, 185‚Äì6.Dunlop, pp. 60‚Äì1; Appendix A.Spiers, pp. 228‚Äì9. Under this scheme the QRVB was included in the Forth Brigade under the command of Col J.H.A. Macdonald, based at 51 Hanover Street, Edinburgh, later at Surgeons' Hall. In 1902 the Forth Brigade was split into the 1st and 2nd Lothian Brigades, with the QVRB in the 1st Brigade based at the QRVB Drill Hall in Forrest Road, later at 28 Rutland Street. =2nd Boer War= A contingent from the brigade served in the Volunteer Service Companies of the Royal Scots alongside the Regulars in the Second Boer War, and others with the Scottish Volunteer Cyclist Company and the City of London Imperial Volunteers. In all, 245 members of the brigade served in the war, earning its first Battle honour: South Africa 1900‚Äì02.Leslie. In 1900, during the 2nd Boer War, the Government provided support (army pay and allowances, with separation allowances for families) for longer than usual summer training camps for the Volunteers. This allowed the Queen's Edinburgh Rifle Brigade to camp for 28 days instead of the usual week, and to concentrate on progressive training.Beckett, p. 220. From 1902 to 1906 the brigade provided one battalion to the 32nd Brigade of the field army for 13 days' annual training, the remainder staying with 1st Lothian Bde. Recruitment soared during the Boer War and the brigade underwent further enlargement in 1900, with the addition of I Company (recruited from Colinton) for 3rd Battalion, and the expansion of the Mounted Infantry detachment to three sections. In 1875 the brigade's highland companies had been ordered to discontinue Highland dress, but in 1900 a complete new Highland Battalion of eight kilted companies was formed in Edinburgh. This was detached from the brigade the following year and became independent as 9th (Highlanders) Volunteer Battalion, Royal Scots. In 1905, Sir Robert Cranston, as one of the lieutenant-colonels of the brigade (as well as its Honorary Colonel, ex officio, as Lord Provost of Edinburgh), participated in meetings with H. O. Arnold-Forster, Secretary of State for War, over the future of the Volunteer Force.Beckett, p. 245. George Watson's Boys' College formed an affiliated cadet corps in 1905. Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the three battalions of the brigade were reorganised to form the 4th and 5th Battalions of the Royal Scots, both granted the subtitle 'Queen's Edinburgh Rifles' in March 1909. A Company of the brigade's 3rd Bn, the old No 4 (Edinburgh University) Company, became the Edinburgh University contingent of the Senior Division of the Officers' Training Corps (OTC) and the Merchiston Castle and George Watson's Cadet Corps joined the Junior Division of the OTC. The two battalions remained in the Lothian Brigade, which did not join any of the TF's new infantry divisions but continued independently in its coast defence role.James, p. 42/ World War I =Mobilisation= 1914 Christmas card by the artist Walter Balmer Hislop, who served in D Company, 1/5th (QER) Bn, as 2nd Lt and died at Gallipoli in April 1915. On the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, the Lothian Brigade mobilised at Edinburgh as part of Scottish Coastal Defences.HQ 221 Mixed Brigade War Diary 4 August 1914 ‚Äì 30 July 1919, The National Archives, Kew, file WO 95/5458. Almost immediately, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form them into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix, and a 2nd Lothian Brigade was formed from these units. 3rd Line training units were formed in 1915. The only TF battalion of the Royal Scots that did not immediately form a 2nd line was the 6th Bn, which instead provided two companies of reinforcements to bring 1/4th Bn up to war establishment. 3rd Line or Reserve battalions were later added to provide drafts to the battalions overseas, but the number of recruits from Edinburgh began to dry up and drafts were often unavailable.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. In preparation for the Gallipoli Campaign, 1/5th Royal Scots left 1st Lothian Bde on 10 March 1915, and 1/4th Bn on 24 April, being replaced by their 2nd Line battalions. =1/4th (QER) Royal Scots= On leaving 1st Lothian Bde the 1/4th (QER) Bn Royal Scots (1/4th RS) joined the Scottish Rifles Brigade in the Lowland Division, which were shortly afterwards numbered as 156th Bde and 52nd Division. The division was at Larbert under orders to proceed to Gallipoli, and on 22 May the battalion entrained for Liverpool where it embarked on the Empress of Britain. The battalion sailed on 24 May via Gibraltar and Malta, arriving on 3 June at Alexandria in Egypt where it went into camp.Becke Pt 2a, pp. 109‚Äì115.Westlake, Gallipoli, pp. 1‚Äì11.Thompson. pp. 11‚Äì5. Gallipoli The battalion re-embarked on the Empress of Britain on 8 June and reached Mudros Bay three days later. C Company was then sent aboard the Carron for Cape Helles, followed by A and B Companies aboard HMS Reindeer. The latter vessel was badly damaged in a collision with HMS Immingham and had to return, the men being transhipped to the French Moulooya and then back to the Empress of Britain. A and B Companies with HQ finally sailed again on 14 June aboard HMS Basilisk, accompanied by D Company aboard HMS Grasshopper. They landed at 'W' Beach and moved about a mile inland to begin digging communication tenches under shellfire. The battalion moved up into the front line where it relieved the 1/5th (QER) Bn (see below) for a five-day spell of duty, during which Quartermaster-Sergeant J. Dewar (a former winner of the King's Prize at Bisley) and Company Sergeant-Major (CSM) D. Lowe distinguished themselves by picking off Turkish snipers.Thompson, pp. 40‚Äì1. 1/4th Battalion returned to the front line on 27 June to take part in the next day's attack on trenches H12A and H12 (the Battle of Gully Ravine) in which 156th Bde was attached to 29th Division. After a bombardment by warships and the artillery ashore, 29th Division attacked at 11.00. 1/4th Royal Scots on 156th Bde's left had the task of assaulting trenches H12 and H12A on the eastern side of Gully Ravine. The battalion had a 12-man bombing party, but two-thirds of the improvised Jam tin grenades failed to go off. Each man had a tin rectangle on his back to reflect the sun and indicate their position to the artillery ‚Äì but 156th Bde was allocated none of the available artillery support. Packed into inadequate jumping-off trenches, the brigade suffered heavily from retaliatory shellfire before it went 'over the top' at 11.02. C and D Companies advanced towards H12A, with A Company following up, all suffering heavy casualties from enfilade fire, including most of the officers. Pipe-Major Andrew Buchan, rifle in hand, led forward one party until hit for the third time he died on the parapet of the trench. After a stiff bayonet fight, this trench was captured. B Company diverged half right and charged the enfilading trench, then a party under CSM Lowe moved on to establish a foothold in the second objective (H12) and prepare it for defence, joined by the battalion machine guns. The battalion's casualties were 15 officers killed or died of wounds (including the Commanding Officer (CO), Lt-Col S.R. Dunn, TD, who died on a hospital ship), 204 other ranks (ORs) killed or missing, seven officers and 141 ORs wounded.Brander, p. 57.Gillon, pp. 49‚Äì51.Thompson, pp. 46‚Äì58. The battalion was relieved the following day and was then attached to 88th Brigade in 29th Division alongside the 1/5th (QER) Bn. It formed X and Y Companies in a composite battalion with the 1/7th Bn (Z Company), which had started as a half battalion, having lost two companies in the Quintinshill rail disaster before embarkation, and had since also lost heavily at Gully Ravine. On 12 July the battalion supported 1/4th Royal Scots Fusiliers during the attack on Trenches E10 and F12 (the Action at Achi Baba Nullah); its casualties were 27 ORs killed and missing, and 47 wounded.Thompson, pp. 102‚Äì26. The weakened battalion was engaged in fatigue duties at 'W' Beach until 11 August when 14 officers (including a new CO, Col A. Young, VD, a former officer of the QEVRB) arrived as reinforcements and the temporary amalgamation with 1/7th Bn ended. 1/4th Battalion then began to take its turns in the firing line and in the reserve line, though at one point it held of trench for four days with an effective rifle strength of only 62 men. Sickness kept many men out of action: in October, of 12 officers and 330 ORs, the effective strength was only 181. On 4 November Col Young went to hospital and the 1/4th RS once again formed a composite battalion with the 1/7th Bn, under the command of Lt-Col W.C. Peebles of 1/7th. The combined battalion seized a Turkish trench on 15 November with few casualties and held it against a counter-attack, but was not involved in any of 52nd Division's other major actions before the decision was made to evacuate the Helles positions.Thompson, pp. 134, 141, 174. Preparations for evacuation were made during early January while the force ashore was slimmed down. 4th/7th Royal Scots formed part of the rearguard, which made its way down to 'V' Beach after dark on 8 January. The battalion was evacuated by lighters and on 9 September sailed aboard HMS Prince George for Mudros. Of the battalion that had originally landed, only the medical officer and 148 ORs remained on the strength.Thompson, pp. 230‚Äì40.Brander, p. 58. Egypt After the evacuation of Helles the 52nd (L) Division moved back to Egypt. After reinforcement and concentration it went to El Qantara and on 2 March 1916 it took over part of No 3 Section of the Suez Canal defences. No 3 or Northern Section of the Canal defences had its outer flank anchored on the Mediterranean. Running inland were a series of redoubts manned by 1/4th RS and the rest of the infantry with machine guns and backed by artillery. On the night of 3/4 August a German and Turkish force attacked the position (the Battle of Romani), but 1/4th RS and saw little action. The attack was driven off by the British artillery. and the ANZAC Mounted Division, then the defenders moved to the counter-attack, though the pursuit bogged down in the appalling desert conditions of Sinai.Bullock, pp. 30‚Äì1.MacMunn & Falls, p. 156.Thompson, p. 286. Palestine After months of preparation the Eastern Expeditionary Force (EEF) crossed the Sinai Desert at the end of 1916 and prepared to invade Palestine, beginning the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. 52nd (L) Division was held in reserve during the 1st Battle of Gaza (26‚Äì27 March 1917) and was not committed.Bullock, pp. 44‚Äì5.MacMunn & Falls, pp. 310‚Äì4. There followed several weeks of preparation for the 2nd Battle of Gaza. The first phase of the attack was carried out on 17 April, with 52nd (L) Division tasked with taking Ali Mansur and the adjoining hills. 156th Brigade was in reserve at Wadi Ghuzze, moving up during the night. On 19 April 156th Bde was ready to attack Mansura at 07.30 after a 2-hour bombardment, with 1/4th RS in the centre under the command of Lt-Col F.H. Goldthorpe. However, 155th (South Scottish) Bde got held up and 156th was pinned down, lying in the open for 5‚Äì6 hours and suffering casualties from shellfire before falling back at the end of the day. The battle ended on 20 April with both sides digging in, the 1/4th RS having suffered casualties of 1 officers and 13 ORs killed, 6 officers and 110 ORs wounded, and 4 ORs missing.Brander, pp. 62‚Äì3.Bullock, pp. 46‚Äì7.MacMunn & Falls, pp. 329‚Äì48.Thompson, pp. 312‚Äì34. The assault on 'Umbrella Hill' and el Arish Redoubt. Turkish trenches at el Arish Redoubt captured by 4th Royal Scots. 52nd (L) Division spent months digging defences, suffering a steady trickle of casualties from shellfire and in raids. 4th Royal Scots (the '1/' prefix was dropped now that the 2nd and 3rd Line battalions had been disbanded, see below) was now commanded by Lt-Col A.M. Mitchell. Several times the battalion sent patrols out into No man's land with a field telephone, then, having located the position of a Turkish standing patrol, called down artillery fire on it.Thompson, p. 349. By the autumn of 1917 the EEF had been revitalised by the arrival of Sir Edmund Allenby as commander-in-chief, and the next operation (the 3rd Battle of Gaza) was much better planned and successful.Bullock, pp. 62‚Äì75. While the Desert Mounted Corps swept round the Turkish flank, 52nd (L) Division down on the coast carried out a direct attack on the strong el Arish position to pin the Turks. 4th Royal Scots was given the daunting task of crossing of No man's land and then storming the central and eastern portion of the formidable el Arish redoubt and the associated 'Little Devil' trench system. The troops practised this attack over trench models for days before the attack went in on 2 November. The first phase of the night attack on 'Umbrella Hill' had died down before 4th RS moved out in the dark to its jumping-off position from the redoubt. Followed by supporting and carrying companies of the 8th Bn Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), and preceded by two tanks (one of which immediately broke down), 4th RS launched its attack at 03.00 as the British artillery pounded the objective. The battalion advanced 'with magnificent steadiness' in four waves on a frontage of under Turkish artillery fire (the remaining tank was hit and burned out after it had crossed the first two lines of trenches). The infantry crossed four lines of trenches, the following waves 'mopping up' the defenders as they advanced, and then they steadily cleared the 'Little Devil' trenches and dugouts, despite losses from landmines. The objective was carried by 03.55, but counter-attacks had to be held off until daybreak. Daylight showed that the furthest trench was untenable, so the battalion moved back a little to the higher ground from which they could deny these trenches to the enemy. Furher counter-attacks came in at the end of the day, but the position was held. When the battalion was relieved that night it had lost about 200 casualties, which had risen to 240 by the end of the battle on 7 November.Brander, p. 65.Bullock, p. 75.Thompson, pp 360‚Äì70. The Turks withdrew to defend the Wadi el Hesi, with 52nd (L) Division well up in pursuit. 156th Brigade was left marching in the rear as the rest of the division stormed the wadi and led the pursuit up the coast towards Junction Station.Bullock, pp. 75‚Äì81.Falls, Egypt and Palestine, Vol II, pp. 131‚Äì6.Thompson, pp. 372‚Äì99. 4th Royal Scots under Lt-Col Mitchell distinguished itself in a successful attack on a Turkish rearguard position at 'Brown Hill' near Burkah, NE of Gaza City on 11 November. The hill was strongly entrenched, but the battalion advanced under Shrapnel shell fire with one company echeloned back to protect the flank. Rushing forward in small parties, the assault wave gathered in the shelter of a wadi at the foot of the hill, and then attacked under covering fire from artillery and machine guns. Having taken the position the Royal Scots discovered a second untouched Turkish line hidden on the reverse slope; they were counter-attacked from this line and pushed part-way back down the hill, but led the reinforcing 2/3rd Gurkha Rifles back up the hill to capture the position before the end of the day. The battalion, already weak, lost 3 officers and 49 ORs killed, 4 officers and 157 ORs wounded.Thompson, pp. 402‚Äì9. The EEF now began its advance on Jerusalem. 52nd (L) Division had to negotiate a poor road through the hills beyond Beit Liqya in heavy rain to join the Battle of Nebi Samwil. 156th Brigade filed along the track in full view of the Turks and under shellfire as they moved up to relieve the Yeomanry Mounted Division. 4th Royal Scots under Lt-Col Mitchell was detached to move west of El Burj to extend 155th Bde's line to try to contact 54th (East Anglian) Division. The two brigades were now strung out in a very thin line and it was too rocky to dig trenches. Lt-Col Mitchell reported that the gap to the 54th Division was wide, but El Burj was held against Turkish attacks during 28 and 29 November until 155th Bde was relieved by the 3rd Australian Light Horse Bde and 4th Royal Scots could rejoin its own brigade. After breaking this counter-offensive, the EEF captured Jerusalem on 11 December.Bullock, pp. 90‚Äì5.Falls, Egypt and Palestine, Vol II, pp. 194‚Äì6.Thompson pp. 462‚Äì73. Passage of the Nahr el Auja 52nd (L) Division's next operation was the tricky passage of the Nahr el Auja to launch the Battle of Jaffa. A patrol of 4th RS crossed on a tarpaulin boat built by the Royal Engineers to reconnoitre the position on the night of 13/14 December. The assault troops of the division then practised using similar canvas boats on a village pond, then at 22.30 on the evening of 20 December, in heavy rain, the first assaulting waves of 156th Bde went forward under cover of an artillery barrage and established a bridgehead. Bridging was made difficult by the flooded river, but the Royal Engineers got the follow-up battalions including 4th Royal Scots across by raft. Accompanied by a section of the brigade machine gun company and a Stokes mortar the battalion attacked 'Slag Heap Farm' and captured it without serious difficulty. By 06.00 the brigade was digging in on a strong line, ready for any counter-attack, but none came: the Turks had been completely surprised, and were in full retreat. The advance was renewed up the coast on the morning of 22 December, with fire support from HMS Grafton and gunboats. 156th Brigade advancing in the centre came under shellfire, but casualties were few. Before nightfall, 52nd (L) Division reached the castle of Arsuf overlooking the Plain of Sharon, where it halted. The Official History describes the passage of the Auja as 'one of the most remarkable feats of the Palestine Campaign'. 4th Royal Scots suffered only 5 ORs killed, 1 officer and 21 ORs wounded.Bullock, p. 96.Falls, Egypt and Palestine, Vol II, pp. 268‚Äì74.Thompson, pp. 480‚Äì501. Western Front In the early part of 1918 the 52nd (L) Division remained in the lines near Arsuf. Then on 24 March it was warned for a transfer to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front. The division's units sailed from Alexandria between 4 and 11 April, and landed at Marseilles by 17 April. The division was concentrated near Abbeville on 23 April. On 29 April it moved to Aire and continued training. On 6 May it moved to the Vimy area and took over front line trenches. On 31 July it moved up to Arras to join in the Hundred Days Offensive.Brander, p. 67.Thompson, pp. 511‚Äì5. On 22 August, 156th Bde was ordered to attack the following morning (the Second Battle of the Somme). Only half the promised number of lorries arrived, and some companies of 4th RS had to march through the night to their jumping-off point south of Mercatel, and there was no time for reconnaissance. The battalion marched straight into action, behind a heavy artillery barrage but without the three tanks that were supposed to accompany them. The attack was a surprise, and the battalion advanced through the wrecked villages, taking all their objectives by 06.45. The tanks then caught up and went out to exploit the ground in front, followed by a company of 4th RS, after which the position was consolidated.Blaxland, p. 207.Thompson, pp. 518‚Äì20. The Battle of the Scarpe began on 26 August. 4th Royal Scots attacked north of the Cojeul River and advanced steadily until they reached the outer defences of the Hindenburg Line.Brander, p. 69.Thompson, pp. 525‚Äì32. On 2 September (the Battle of Drocourt-Qu√©ant Line) 4th Royal Scots moved against the tremendously strong defences at the Qu√©ant end of the Drocourt-Qu√©ant Switch Line and took their objectives with amazing ease. The left of the battalion captured the Moulin Sans Souci windmill, and Lt-Col Mitchell pushed his reserve company into the gap to work along the Hindenburg Line trenches. From 22 to 26 August 4th RS lost 27 ORs killed and 10 missing, 3 officers and 114 ORs wounded, and 3 officers and 98 ORs gassed as the Germans deployed large quantities of Mustard Gas. The battalion was then rested until late September.Thompson, pp. 539‚Äì44. It was brought back into the line on 20 September facing a well-fortified section of the Hindenburg Line on the Canal du Nord. The British held Moeuvres, and the Germans had been counter-attacking the village. They made another attack against 7th RS on 21 September, but at the end of the day four platoons of 4th RS rushed and captured the Germans' strongpoint at E14 Central. Fighting continued around these positions after 4th RS had been relieved.Thompson, pp. 553‚Äì6. 156th Brigade's role in the great Battle of the Canal du Nord was to attack across the canal, then turn to its right and clear the trenches to the south-east. The British barrage came down at 05.00 on 27 September and the German guns immediately replied on the forming-up trenches. Nevertheless, 4th RS under Lt-Col Mitchell led 156th Bde off at 05.30 as the barrage began to move forwards. They had no tanks because the banks of the dry canal were an obstacle, and on reaching the canal realised that a frontal assault would be very costly, so the battalion reorganised to work round the left flank. Corporal Foggo dashed forwards and threw two Mills bombs into a pillbox that held them up, and the men scrambled down into and across the canal. By 09.55 the battalion had reached their objective. The battalion's losses in defending Moeuvres were 6 officers and 81 ORs, and in forcing the Canal du Nord lost another 11 officers and 96 ORs.Brander, p. 71.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 33‚Äì4.Thompson, pp. 560‚Äì8. 52nd (L) Division took part in the pursuit after the Canal du Nord, before 4th RS were rested from 7 to 27 October. Then on 28 October the battalion went back into the line north east of St Amand for the Final Advance in Artois. The division had closed up to the Mons‚ÄìCond√© Canal by 8 November, when it became known that the Germans had abandoned the water defences. The code word 'Hunt' was issued, and 156th Bde crossed in canvas boats to begin the pursuit. By 10 November the brigade was clearing German rearguards from Herchies, near Mons. When the Armistice with Germany came into effect at 11.00 on 11 November the division had reached the Nimy‚ÄìJurbise road.Thompson, pp. 569‚Äì72. After the Armistice the troops were employed in training and clearing up the area. Demobilisation proceeded and between the end of January and end of May 1919 the division's units were reduced to cadres and returned to the UK. The 1/4th Bn was officially disembodied on 24 May 1919. =1/5th (QER) Royal Scots= River Clyde. The 1/5th (QER) Battalion, Royal Scots, joined 88th Bde in 29th Division at Leamington on 11 March 1915. It was the only TF battalion in what was otherwise a Regular Army formation composed of battalions brought back to the UK from around the British Empire following the outbreak of war.Becke Pt 1, pp. 117‚Äì24.Brander, p. 56.Gillon, p. 6 & Appendix II. The battalion entrained for Avonmouth Docks on 21/22 March where it embarked on the Caledonia and the Melville and sailed via Malta to Alexandria where it disembarked on 2 April and went into camp. It re-embarked on 6 April aboard the Dongola, Haverford, Kingstonian, Marquette, and Melville for Mudros, where it joined the British forces gathering for the Landing at Cape Helles. After lying anchored off Tenedos the force began landing at 07.00 on 25 April. Two companies of 1/5th Bn landed at V Beach at 12.30 without casualties and moved forward to the support trenches. The other two companies landed later to provide working parties on the beach, unloading stores under fire and suffering casualties. One of the advanced companies was moved up into the firing line on 26 April and the battalion joined in the general advance against Achi Baba Ridge the following afternoon. By 08.00 on 28 April the battalion had suffered heavy casualties, including the CO, Lt-Col J.T.R. Wilson wounded, and had to be withdrawn from the advanced positions. The battalion was moved to the left where it began building a redoubt, and then moved back to reserve positions.Gillon, pp. 28, 35‚Äì6,. On 7 May, during the operations around Krithia Nullah, 1/5th RS were able to rush the Turkish strongpoint of Fir Tree Wood; it was then lost to a counter-attack, but 88th Bde had recovered it by the end of the day. Overall, however the fighting was inconclusive.Gillon, pp. 38‚Äì9. 88th Brigade again took terrible casualties in the Battle of Gully Ravine on 28 June (see above). At one point Second lieutenant Herbert James of the 4th Bn Worcestershire Regiment found some platoons of 1/5th RS without any officers and led them into the first line of Turkish trenches, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. The attack of 28 June was the last major action at Gallipoli for the 1/5th RS. Reduced to less than a company's strength and with no drafts from home, it was evacuated to Mudros in July for rest and was replaced in 29th Division by the Royal Newfoundland Regiment from the 1st Lothian Bde. Rebuilt to half-battalion strength, about 300 men, the 1/5th RS returned to the Gallipoli Peninsula in August for two more spells of trench duty, including being in reserve for 88th Bde's attack on 6 August and the Battle of Scimitar Hill, before being withdrawn to Egypt in October.Gillon, pp. 54‚Äì6, 59‚Äì60. On 10 March 1916 the battalion embarked at Port Said for France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front. =5th/6th Royal Scots= After arriving in France on 22 March the weak 1/5th RS was assigned to Line of communication (LoC) duties in April 1916. Then on 15 May it was amalgamated with the 1/6th Royal Scots to form the 5th/6th Bn. Having contributed large drafts to the 1/4th (QER) Bn, 1/6th Bn did not leave the Lothian Bde until 5 September 1915 and went to Egypt where it joined the Western Frontier Force (WFF) on 20 November. After serving with the WFF in the Senussi Campaign it was sent to France on 27 February 1916 for LoC duties on the Western Front. 1/6th arrived at Marseilles on 15 May 1916 and was immediately amalgamated with 1/5th. On 29 July the combined 5th/6th RS joined 14th Bde in 32nd Division. The 32nd was a Kitchener's Army formation that had been bolstered by the Regular 14th Bde. It had suffered heavy casualties on the First day of the Somme (1 July)Edmonds 1916, pp. 409‚Äì10, 421. and 5th/6th Royal Scots replaced one of its shattered battalions.Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 21‚Äì9. At dawn on 16 November, 14th Bde took over an ill-defined section of line forming a defensive flank to the attacks being made in the Battle of the Ancre Heights. Following a fall of snow and chilling rain, the brigade was ordered to push the flank forward towards 'Ten Tree Alley' when the rest of the division attacked on 18 November. Little headway was made in this last gasp of the Somme offensive.Miles, pp. 512‚Äì24. The division took part in minor operations along the Ancre in January and February 1917, and then followed the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line (Operation Alberich) in March and April. During this pursuit the 32nd Division carried out the British Army's first open warfare operation on the Western Front since 1914. By nightfall on 1 April, 14th Bde had reached Holnon Wood. At 05.00 on 2 April it put in a successful attack and captured this large wood.Falls, France and Belgium 1917, Vol I, pp. 156‚Äì8. In June the division was moved to the Flanders coast to support an expected breakthrough at Ypres that never came. However, the Germans put in a spoiling attack at Nieuport (Operation Strandfest) on 10‚Äì11 July, preceded by three days of bombardment. 14th Brigade was not closely engaged, and a planned counter-attack was abandoned.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, pp. 116‚Äì22. The Germans launched their Spring Offensive (Operation Michael) south of Arras in March 1918 and 32nd Division was sent to the area as reinforcements. On 3 April, 14th Bde took part in the night attack to recapture Ayette, and on 5 April the final attempt to relaunch Operation Michael was defeated at the Battle of the Ancre.Edmonds, 1918, Vol II, p. 111. During May and June, which was quiet on the British front, the 5th/6th RS carried out raids. The Allied Hundred Days Offensive began on 8 August with the Battle of Amiens. 32nd Division was in reserve on the first day, though 5th/6th RS was briefly engaged. 14th Brigade then led the division's attack on 11 August, with 5th/6th RS and 1st Dorset Regiment in front. As soon as they advanced they came under heavy fire, but they got close to the village of Damery with the help of two tanks that went through the village twice. The attack was then halted to avoid heavier casualties.Brander, p. 68.Edmonds, 1918, Vol IV, pp. 144‚Äì5. The brigade was in reserve for 32nd Division's attack on 23 August. On 28 August during the Battle of the Scarpe 14th Bde attacked at 05.00 and advanced unopposed towards its first two objectives: 5th/6th RS's advance was described as 'a procession', and by the end of the day the brigade had observation over the Somme Valley. Soon after dawn the next day they had pushed right up to the river.Edmonds, 1918, Vol IV, pp. 330, 339. 5th/6th Royal Scots was then pulled out of the line, but it returned to cross the Somme Canal and river on 5 September. At 10.30 one company waded across at the site of Brie bridge, despite machine gun fire; it then cleared Brie, bombing the dugouts, while a second company crossed by a temporary footbridge. The two companies then established a line beyond the village, and the division passed through later in the day.Edmonds, 1918, Vol IV, pp. 445‚Äì6. There was then another rest until the Battle of St Quentin Canal began on 29 September. Facing the most formidable part of the Hindenburg Line on the St Quentin Canal, 5th/6th RS did not go into action until 1 October, once the line had been breached. At 16.00 they were directed against the key position in the German second line, the village of Sequehart, just north of St Quentin. The village changed hands four times until on 3 October the battalion, which had specifically asked for another chance to take the village, succeeded in holding it, despite heavy shelling and two more counter-attacks.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 139, 142, 163. By early November the army had closed up to the Sambre‚ÄìOise Canal. The Battle of the Sambre opened on 4 November. Two platoons of 5th/6th RS were given the task of attacking le Donjon two minutes after Zero Hour behind special barrage, and if possible to obtain a crossing over the canal. Finding themselves unable to follow the assigned path through the marsh, the two platoons the half the battalion followed the 1st Dorsets across a floating bridge; le Donjon fell at 10.45. At 13.30 the 5th/6th RS and 1st Dorsets advanced to establish the bridgehead defences: the opposition was so negligible that no barrage was required.Blaxland, p. 256.Edmonds & Maxwell- Hyslop, pp. 470‚Äì1. The advance continued, with the division capturing Grand- Fayt on 6 November and Avesnes on 8 November, which it was occupying on 11 November when the Armistice came into force. 32nd Division was chosen as part of the occupation force (the British Army of the Rhine) and advanced to the Meuse between Dinant and Namur, where it became the reserve to the army in Germany. On 3 February 1919 the division took over the southern sector of the Cologne bridgehead, but by then the remaining TF units were being demobilised. and 5th/6th Royal Scots left for home between 25 February and 19 March. It was disembodied on 12 November 1919. =2/4th and 2/5th (QER) Royal Scots= After formation in September 1914 2/4th (QER) Bn went to Penicuik in February 1915 and both transferred from 2nd Lothian Bde to 1st Lothian Bde at Peebles to replace their 1st Line battalions. They left in October and November 1915 to join 195th Bde in 65th (2nd Lowland) Division.Becke Pt 2b, pp. 61‚Äì5. In November 1915 the infantry battalions in the 64th (2nd Highland) and 65th (2nd Lowland) Divisions were reorganised and numbered sequentially, the 2/4th, 2/5th and 2/6th Royal Scots temporarily combining as No 19 Battalion; by May 1916 they had reverted to their previous regimental designations, but 2/5th remained merged with 2/4th. 195th Brigade was stationed at Dunfermline during the winter of 1915‚Äì16. In March 1916, 65th (2nd L) Division moved into England and joined Southern Army (Home Forces), 195th Bde being quartered in Essex around Billericay and then from July at Terling. In January 1917 the division moved to Ireland to relieve 59th (2nd North Midland) Division, which had been the first TF formation to serve in that country. 2/4th Battalion was stationed at Fermoy. During 1917 the 2nd Line TF battalions in 65th (2nd Lowland) Division were progressively replaced by Graduated Battalions of the Training Reserve; in August 1917 the 2/4th Royal Scots was disbanded and was replaced by 217th Graduated Bn. =3/4th and 3/5th Royal Scots= The 3rd Line battalions of the Queen's Edinburgh Rifles were formed as training units at Peebles in May 1915 and moved to Loanhead and Galashiels respectively in November. They were designated as the 4th and 5th Reserve Bns, Royal Scots, on 8 April 1916 and wre at Stobs Military Camp in May. On 1 September 1916, while they were at Catterick Camp in North Yorkshire, the 4th Reserve Bn absorbed the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Reserve Bns. It also absorbed the 9th (Highland) Reserve Bn in June 1917. The combined battalion moved back to Edinburgh, in the Edinburgh Special Reserve Brigade, in November 1917, then to Haddington in April 1918, and was at Cupar in the Forth Garrison at the end of the war. It was disbanded on 28 June 1919 in Glasgow. =6th Scottish Provisional Battalion= In 1915 the Home Service men of the 4th, 5th and 6th Royal Scots were combined into 6th Scottish Provisional Battalion, which joined the Lothian Brigade (redesignated the Scottish Provisional Brigade and later 1st Provisional Brigade) on 22 May. In April 1916 the 1st Provisional Bde moved from Scotland to Kent to take over coastal defence duties. The Military Service Act 1916 swept away the Home/Foreign service distinction, and all TF soldiers became liable for overseas service, if medically fit, and the remaining provisional battalions were reorganised, but the 6th Provisional Bn had already been disbanded and its men dispersed.Frederick, p. 184.Army Council Instruction No 221, January 1916, Appendix 18.Army Council Instruction No 2364, 17 December 1916, Appendix 204. Interwar 90 cm 'Projector Anti- Aircraft', displayed at Fort Nelson, Hampshire. The TF was reconstituted on 7 February 1920 and the 52nd (Lowland) Division and its units began to reform. The 4th and 5th (QER) Battalions did guard duty during the coal strike of April 1921. After the TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA), the two battalions reformed in 1921 as a single 4th/5th (Queen's Edinburgh Rifles) Bn, Royal Scots, and absorbed 10th (Cyclist) Bn, Royal Scots at Linlithgow as A Company.Brander, p. 78. The combined battalion formed part of 155th (East Scottish) Bde in 52nd (L) Division.Titles and designations, 1927. =AA Conversion= During the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of TA infantry battalions into AA units. The 4th/5th (QER) Royal Scots was one of the battalions selected, becoming a Royal Artillery searchlight (S/L) regiment on 1 November 1938 while remaining affiliated with the Royal Scots. It was designated 4th/5th (Queen's Edinburgh) Bn The Royal Scots (The Royal Regiment) (52nd Searchlight Regiment) and consisted of HQ, 405, 406, 407 Companies based at Forrest Road. At the same time, the TA was doubled in size following the Munich Crisis, so A Company at Linlithgow was separated to become the basis for 14th (West Lothian Royal Scots) Light AA Regiment, RA.Brander, pp. 95‚Äì6.Frederick, pp. 859, 869.Monthly Army List, January 1939.Litchfield, pp. 298‚Äì300. World War II =52nd (Queen's Edinburgh, Royal Scots) Searchlight Regiment= 3 AA Divisional sign. The regiment formed part of 3 AA Division covering Scotland. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. 4th/5th Royal Scots (52nd S/L Rgt) became part of 52nd Light Anti-Aircraft Brigade, which was formed in August 1939 with responsibility for all of 3 AA Division's S/L provision.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378. As part of the Forth defences, 52nd Searchlight Regiment was engaged in the first air raid against the UK during World War II, when German aircraft attacked the Royal Naval Dockyard at Rosyth near the Forth Bridge on 16 October 1939. During the Phoney War period there were a number of other attacks on the naval bases of Scotland before the Luftwaffe turned its attention to the campaigns in Norway and France and the Low Countries.Routledge, pp. 374‚Äì6. In February 1940 the regiment sent a cadre of 5 officers and 27 ORs to 222nd Searchlight Training Regiment, RA, at Norton Manor Barracks near Taunton, where, with a similar cadre from 51st (Highland) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, Royal Engineers, they formed a new 474th Searchlight Battery, Royal Artillery, from new conscripts and volunteers. This independent battery served wit AA Command and later provided artificial illumination, or 'Monty's Moonlight', for night operations by 21st Army Group during the campaign in North West Europe in 1944‚Äì45.474 S/L Bty War Diary, 1940‚Äì41, TNA] file WO 166/3322.474 (Ind) S/L Bty War Diary, January‚ÄìJune 1944, TNA file WO 166/14909. In August 1940 the RA took over all the S/L regiments in AA Command, after which the regiment was designated 52nd (Queen's Edinburgh, Royal Scots) Searchlight Regiment, RA, and the companies were termed batteries.Farndale, Annex M. Eastern Scotland largely escaped air attack during the Battle of Britain. In November 1940, at the height of The Blitz, a new 12 AA Division was formed to take over responsibility for western Scotland (including Glasgow and the Clyde) while 3 AA Division (including 52 LAA Bde and 52nd S/L Rgt) retained responsibility for eastern Scotland. The regiment remained in 52 AA Bde and 3 AA Division for the next year.moving to positions in the Scottish Borders.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TNA file WO 212/79. The regiment supplied another cadre of experienced officers and men to 237th S/L Training Rgt at Holywood, County Down, where it provided the basis for a new 535 S/L Bty formed on 14 November 1940. This battery later joined 56th (5th Battalion, Cameronian Scottish Rifles) S/L Rgt. On 11 February 1941 52nd S/L Rgt was joined by 531 S/L Bty formed on 14 November at 235th S/L Training Rgt at Ayr from a cadre provided by 56th S/L Rgt.Frederick, p. 861. By December 1941, 408 S/L Bty had transferred to 53rd S/L Rgt (5th Bn Royal Northumberland Fusiliers)Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, TNA file WO 212/80. =130th (Queen's Edinburgh, Royal Scots) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment= By 1942, AA Command had more than enough S/L units, but was still seriously short of light anti- aircraft (LAA) gun units, and began a programme of converting S/L units (which also had the benefit of saving manpower). In March 52nd S/L Rgt was converted to the LAA role as 130th (Queen's Edinburgh, Royal Scots) LAA Rgt, the batteries becoming 406, 407 and 426 LAA Btys. After training it remained in 52 AA Bde in 3 AA Division, stationed in Aberdeenshire.Frederick, pp. 806, 840.Routledge, p. 400.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/81. In August 1942, 3 AA Divisional HQ moved south to help control the AA units brought in to defend against Luftwaffe 'hit and run' attacks on the South Coast of England.Routledge, pp. 402‚Äì3. Simultaneously, 52 AA Bde HQ left AA Command to mobilise for the landings in North Africa (Operation Torch).Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 22 November 1942, TNA file WO 212/8. 130th LAA Regiment moved to 51 AA Bde in a new 6 AA Group that took over responsibility for Scotland in October.

Operation Diver right thumbright LAA guns emplaced on the South Coast, August 1944. 130th LAA Regiment was stationed on the Kent coast, in the so-called 'Hellfire Corner' where Cross-Channel shelling from German guns was frequent. In November 1943 2 AA Gp was ordered to plan for the expected onslaught of V-1 flying bombs (codenamed 'Divers') against London, to which it responded by planning a thick belt of Heavy AA (HAA) gun positions across the likely flight path, backed by LAA guns. Meanwhile, 2 AA Gp also had to deal with a sharp increase in Luftwaffe air raids trying to reach London during the winter of 1943‚Äì1944 (the so-called 'Little Blitz'), in which the regiment was heavily engaged. However, AA Command was being forced to release manpower for overseas service, particularly the Allied invasion of Normandy, Operation Overlord, and many AA regiments lost one of their four batteries; by March 1944, 446 LAA Bty had been disbanded.Routledge, pp. 408‚Äì10. Once 'Overlord' began on 6 June (D-Day) the shelling of Hellfire Corner increased in intensity. The first V-1 missiles were launched against London a week after D-Day, and Operation Diver was activated. 2 AA Group's batteries left their 'Overlord' sites and moved to pre-planned sites across the 'funnel' of V-1 flightpaths. However, the results were disappointing, and the HAA gun belt was moved to the coast and interlaced with LAA guns to hit the missiles out to sea. This new belt was divided into six brigade sectors, with 71 AA Bde taking charge of one. The guns were constantly in action and their success rate against the 'Divers' steadily improved, until over 50 per cent of incoming missiles were destroyed by gunfire or fighter aircraft. This phase of Operation Diver ended in September after the V-1 launch sites in Northern France had been overrun by 21st Army Group.Routledge, pp. 410‚Äì16; Table LXX, p. 423; Map 38. A new phase of Operation Diver began when the Luftwaffe began launching V-1s from aircraft over the North Sea. AA Command had to reorganise its defences, stripping guns from existing sites and moving them to the coast of East Anglia, which entailed enormous reorganisation. As the Luftwaffe and V-1 threat to the UK diminished, AA Command was forced to transfer men and units to infantry duties.Routledge, pp. 416‚Äì7. 130th LAA Regiment avoided all the shuffling and disbandments, remaining with 71 AA Bde in 2 AA Gp throughout the Diver offensive and until the end of the war.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, TNA file WO 212/85. After the war it transferred to 28 (Thames and Medway) AA Bde in 1 AA Gp as demobilisation proceeded.Order of Battle of AA Command, 15 November 1945, TNA file WO 212/86. Postwar AA Command's formation sign. When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, the regiment reformed at Edinburgh as 587 (Queen's Edinburgh, Royal Scots) LAA Rgt. It formed part of 62 AA Bde (the former 36 (Scottish) AA Bde).Frederick, p. 1024.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947. When AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955 there was a major reduction in the number of AA units in the TA. 587 LAA Rgt amalgamated with R Bty of 471 (Forth) HAA Rgt, 514 (West Lothian, Royal Scots) LAA Rgt and 519 (Dunedin) LAA Rgt to form a new 432 LAA Rgt with the following organisation:Frederick, p. 1013.

When the TA was converted into the TAVR in 1967, 432 Engineer Regiment was reduced to a single 104 (City of Edinburgh) Field Squadron in 71 (Scottish) Engineer Regiment. It was disbanded in 1999.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 298. Uniform, Insignia and Bands The original uniform worn by the Queen's Edinburgh Rifles was a long tunic and trousers in dark Volunteer grey with black braiding and a low black-peaked cap. The three original Highland companies wore black-laced grey doublets and kilts of Black Watch ('Government') tartan with different bonnets for each of the three companies. Each of the original 21 QER companies had a different cap badge. The cut of the tunic was later changed to match that of the Rifle Brigade, and the original low peaked cap was replaced first (1862) by a Shako with a black ball-tuft, next (1875) by a Busby with black plume and then (1895) by a black Astrakhan fur busby matching the Rifle Brigade. In 1900‚Äì1901 the brigade adopted a drab felt hat; this was prohibited in 1902 but a drab service dress with light green Austrian knot and trouser piping was adopted for marching and drill order, with a drab felt hat (with black plume for the mounted infantry). The grey uniform was retained for full dress until 1908 when the battalions adopted the scarlet uniform tunic with blue facings of the Royal Scots. The regimental tartan was Hunting Stuart, while the pipers wore Royal Stewart tartan. In 1943, 130th LAA Rgt adopted as its regimental flash a silhouette of the Royal Scots' other ranks' cap badge in black cloth, the colour commemorating the black braiding of the QER. In 1947, 587th LAA Rgt adopted a black silhouette of a Thistle head on a brown square; this was officially approved as its regimental flash on 9 November 1951 and worn until 1955. The 1st City of Edinburgh RVC formed a band early in its history, adopting the regimental march of the Rifle Brigade, I'm Ninety-Five. The early QER Highland companies each had two pipers, and the corps also had a bugle band. Honorary Colonels From the formation of the 1st QERVB the Lord Provost of Edinburgh served ex officio as its Honorary Colonel. From 1873 additional honorary colonels were added: * James Moncreiff, 1st Baron Moncreiff, lt-col commandant 1859‚Äì73, appointed 17 May 1873Burke's * D.

A memorial Masonic Lodge, Queen's Edinburgh Rifles (The Royal Scots) No 1253, was established on 3 February 1921, under the Grand Lodge of Scotland, to commemorate those members who died in World War I. A lodge room was established in 1925 at the Forrest Road drill hall which also served as a Territorial Army headquarters and as a building for the University of Edinburgh Officer Training Corps. The Lodge now meets in Portobello but maintains its role as a memorial lodge. Notes References * Army Council Instructions Issued During January 1916, London: HM Stationery Office, 1916. * Maj A.F.

Biography He was born in London on 22 September 1872 to an English father and an Austrian mother. After initial training from his mother, who had been a piano pupil of Friedrich Wieck, he entered the Royal Academy of Music in Vienna at the age of nine. On graduating from the Academy he undertook further studies in piano and composition in Vienna before becoming a coach at the Court Opera in that city. In this role he was discovered by an impresario named Pollini who brought him to Hamburg where he was assistant conductor to Gustav Mahler. After a two-year apprenticeship under Mahler, Rothwell left Hamburg to conduct operatic performances in many European cities, becoming director of the Royal Opera in Amsterdam. In 1904-5 he went on a large tour of the United States with the Henry W. Savage company conducting Parsifal by Wagner: this was so successful that he later undertook a similar tour of Madama Butterfly by Puccini (eventually marrying Elizabeth Wolff, the soprano in the latter work's title role). He returned to Europe to conduct opera in Frankfurt, but soon sought release to take the podium of the St Paul Symphony Orchestra, deciding that he preferred symphonic conducting to opera. He conducted this orchestra for seven years until it was disbanded because of financial problems resulting from the United States' entry into World War I. He moved to New York City and focused on teaching and guest conducting appointments. In the summer of 1919, Rothwell became the first music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, chosen by founder William Andrews Clark, Jr. after the position was declined by Sergei Rachmaninoff. He continued in this position until 13 March 1927 when he died of a heart attack while driving to the beach at Santa Monica, California where he often would go to study music scores.

When he was a boy, he and his grandfather were the only members of a peaceful and harmless space colony to escape a massacre and slave raid (the \\"Mount Pleasant Massacre\\") perpetrated by pirates led by five master criminals known as the \\"Demon Princes.\\" The grandfather devotes the rest of his life to training the young Gersen‚Äîon Earth, Alphanor and other central planets of the Oikumene‚Äîto be an assassin. The young Gersen's mission is to avenge the massacre by tracking down and summarily executing the Demon Princes. Appearance and demeanour Gersen is about 34 at the beginning of Star King, the first book in the series. He is an expert in numerous fighting techniques, including bare-handed combat, knife-fighting, and the exotic poisoning techniques practiced by the Sarkoy. He is also intelligent and patient, capable of a good deal of deductive work, and possessed of ample courage, given that his life's quest must necessarily bring him into opposition with five of the inhabited galaxy's most dangerous and unscrupulous criminals, all of whom possess vast resources (in the case of Viole Falushe, a planet of his own). Wealth and resources At the beginning of his quest, Gersen owns a small spaceship, and otherwise possesses little wealth, though enough to go extremely well armed when circumstances both demand and permit it, and enough to further his detective work with occasional minor purchases and bribes. During the events described in The Killing Machine, however, Gersen gains fabulous wealth (10 billion SVU in cashUsing 1964 as the base year for US$ inflation this is 76.6 billion SVU in current (2014) prices) by running a scam on Kokor Hekkus, a Demon Prince who is holding him for ransom, and on Interchange, the institution that facilities the ransoming of kidnap victims. However, he is not given to conspicuous consumption and, barring expenditure on a succession of new and more luxurious spacecraft, he uses his money mostly to further his work. He acquires at least one bank and a magazine with galaxy-wide circulation, the latter allowing him to assume the identity of a reporter from time to time. Personality Given his unusual circumstances, it would not be unreasonable to expect Gersen to be a borderline sociopath. Instead, he is as much concerned with the welfare of his fellow man as an average man might be, and not one who had spent fifteen years or more in training to become an assassin. He displays chivalry upon occasion, inconveniencing himself, sustaining injury or putting himself in harm's way to rescue women who are in need. A common view is that he is a normal man who has had a path in life forced upon him. The true villains of the series are the five Demon Princes and, also perhaps his grandfather, who molded him into a killing machine to exact his revenge. However, the redemptive piece is that Kirth's humanity prevails - at the end of his quest, he has at least a chance of living a 'normal life'. Romantic entanglements During the course of the novels, he experiences a series of romantic interludes of gradually increasing intensity. In Star King, he dates a young clerk, Pallis Atwrode, whom he must later rescue. In The Killing Machine, he encounters Alusz Iphigenia Eperje-Tokay, and seems to be growing involved with her; but early in the following book, The Palace of Love, the pair split up, chiefly because Alusz Iphigenia cannot understand his cold and singleminded pursuit of vengeance, especially since the now-wealthy Gersen could subcontract his dangerous and horrifying life's work. At the end, she even starts to fear him a little. It is unclear whether this relationship was ever consummated. His quest for Viole Falushe brings him into association with Drusilla Wayles, a parthenogenetic daughter of Jheral Tinzy, Viole Falushe's lifelong obsession, from whom he later parts rather than repeat the unhappy ending of his relationship with Alusz Iphigenia. At the end of the book, he meets another, slightly older, Drusilla, and the acquaintance appears mutually delightful. However, there is no sign of her by the time of the events chronicled in The Face. During this fourth quest, he meets yet another young woman, Jerdian Chanseth, only to lose her too, owing to the snobbish exclusivity of her father and homeworld. Finally, he has the aid and companionship of Alice Wroke in The Book of Dreams. As the saga closes with all his enemies brought to harsh justice at his hands, Gersen faces the difficult transition from monomaniacal assassin to ordinary citizen. Jehan Addels Gersen has one long-term associate. Having come into possession of an enormous fortune via a swindle perpetrated in the lawless Beyond (see above), Gersen needs to invest the money. To this end, he engages a financial advisor named Jehan Addels, whom he promises a large salary with regular increments and the interesting challenge of investing an enormous amount of money that would bankrupt many a government. He chooses Addels on the basis of his reputation for competence and honesty, wanting neither to destabilise any economies, nor to see his vast wealth embezzled; and especially not to compromise his own anonymity by sending ripples through the financial world. Addels takes on the work and delivers sterling service, and also furthers Gersen's detective work from time to time, occasionally at some risk to his own person. For the most part, he suspends judgment as to Gersen's life's work, which he chooses not to enquire into too closely; but given that at one point he becomes directly involved in the plot to hunt down Lens Larque, it may be supposed that he has some idea what Gersen is about, and approves.

Population: 25,166 (2002 Census); History The railway station of Olenya () was opened in 1916, with the construction of the Murman Railway. The station facilities, and the small settlement associated with the station were located to the east of the railroad. Their importance was somewhat increased in the 1930s, as Olenya became a junction for the railway branch to the newly built town of Monchegorsk some to the southwest. In 1949, work started on the iron ore strip mines and ore-processing facilities a few kilometers to the west of the Olenya station. At the same time, construction of a company town, originally also named Olenya, started between the rail station and the mines, to the west of the railway. In December 1949, it was granted work settlement status. By the March 27, 1957 Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR, the work settlement of Olenya was granted the status of a town under district jurisdiction, subordinated to Monchegorsk, and given its present name.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 55 The railway station, however, retained the name Olenya and was not renamed Olenegorsk until the 1980s. Olenegorsk was elevated in status to that of a town under oblast jurisdiction by the August 10, 1981 Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR Decree, and several inhabited localities previously subordinated to Monchegorsk were transferred to Olenegorsk by the August 26, 1981 Decision of the Murmansk Oblast Executive Committee.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 57 Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with four rural localities, incorporated as Olenegorsk Town with Jurisdictional Territory‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Law #96-01-ZMO As a municipal division, Olenegorsk Town with Jurisdictional Territory is incorporated as Olenegorsk Urban Okrug.Law #534-01-ZMO Transportation All passengers trains on the St. Petersburg‚ÄìMurmansk railway stop at Olenegorsk. The station also serves the nearby town of Monchegorsk, which itself has next to no passenger service, the Olenya airbase (a.k.a. Vysoky), a more remote Sami village of Lovozero, and the mining town of Revda in Lovozersky District. Economy The town economy continues to be based on iron ore extraction and processing, mostly shipping enriched ore to Severstal in Cherepovets. Military bases include the Olenya air base and Olenegorsk Radar Station.

The school, an offshoot of Central High School (now Cardozo Senior High School), originally was called McKinley Technical High School and was located at 7th Street NW and Rhode Island Avenue NW in the District of Columbia. The United States Congress allocated $26 million in 1926 for the construction of the existing building at 2nd and T Streets NE, in the Eckington area. The school is named for William McKinley, the 25th President of the United States.  Academics  McKinley Tech is a STEM-focused DCPS application high school. Students focus on one of three courses of study: Engineering, Information Technology (Networking, Computer Science, and Digital Media), or Biotechnology.  History  The school was exclusively for white residents of the City of Washington until integrated with other DC schools by an Executive Order by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in June 1954. The school underwent a rapid change in the ethnic groups attending the school, similar to other schools in Washington, DC, and was a majority African-American school by 1960. The school continued to offer outstanding programs in printing, automotive technology, and other technical fields. Between 1929 and 1940 and again in 1942-1943 the school's gymnasium, Tech Gymnasium, served as a home court for the Georgetown Hoyas basketball team. In 1965, the school's football field was a secret emergency landing area for President Lyndon B. Johnson in the event of a national emergency or attack on the United States. By the late 1960s, Tech's boys basketball teams, nicknamed the \\"Trainers\\", coached by the late McKinley Armstrong, reached national prominence, winning city, league, and even parochial school invitational tournaments. The school had a television production program taught in the Lemuel Penn Center in the 1970s. Its quiz teams during that era fared well on America's longest running television quiz program, It's Academic. Enrollment fell from a peak of 2400 in the late 1960s to approximately 500 in the mid-1990s. The school was selected for closure during the period of the congressionally authorized financial control board. The school was shuttered in June 1997. During the mayoral election campaign of 1998, then Chief Financial Officer Anthony A. Williams promised the city a technology-focused high school to connect city youth with the growing technology base of the Washington-area economy. After assuming the position of Mayor in January 1999, planning began on a school that did not have a decided location. In 2000 a decision was made to place the new school in the closed McKinley facility. Plans at that time included placing incubator companies in the facility and using the facility for professional development for the DC Public Schools and for the growing charter schools movement. In July 2001, the school's opening was delayed from 2002 to 2003. In January 2002, Daniel Gohl assumed the role of Founding Principal, coming from the Science Academy of Austin in Austin, Texas. In October 2002 the DC School Board delayed the opening again to September 2004. Renovations to the older campus and modernization in a manner consistent with its intended role as a technology school were cited as reasons for the delay. The school finally reopened on September 1, 2004, for grades 9 and 10. On August 28, 2006, the school had a complete program for grades 9-12 and an enrollment of 800 students. David Pinder was appointed principal in 2007. On September 7, 2012 Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan named McKinley a National Blue Ribbon School. David Pinder was awarded DCPS Principal of the Year, 2012.  Athletics The McKinley Tech Trainers compete in the DCIAA. They offer baseball, bowling, boys' basketball (JV and varsity), boys' soccer, cheerleading, cross country, flag football, football, girls' basketball, girls' soccer, indoor track, softball, swimming, tennis, track, and volleyball.

It was released on their second album, A Northern Soul. It was released on 12 June 1995 as the second single from the album charting at #28 in the UK Singles Chart. Lyrics The song appears to be based on the work of The Smiths, using some of their techniques, such as adding major sevenths - and even features a lyric close to the one in \\"How Soon Is Now?\\": \\"You come in on your own and you leave on your own\\" This Verve lyric can find easy comparisons with: \\"and you stand on your own and you leave on your own\\". Lead singer Richard Ashcroft also recorded an acoustic version of On Your Own that contained only piano and acoustic guitar, in addition to Ashcroft's vocals.

Contemporary view Arabs had occupied the city of Avignon in 734, after it had been surrendered to Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri, Umayyad governor of Narbonne, by Duke Maurontus of Provence.Riche, Pierre (1993). The Carolingians: A Family Who Forged Europe. University of Pennsylvania Press. , p. 45. According to the Continuations of Fredegar, Maurontus probably invited Yusuf into the city after forming an alliance with him against Martel. The Chronicle of Moissac confirms that Yusuf's forces moved peacefully from Arab-held Septimania into Provence and entered Avignon without a fight. In reaction, Martel sent his brother Duke Childebrand south in 736, accompanied by fellow dukes and counts. Childebrand laid siege to Avignon and held the field until his brother was ready to storm the city.Fouracre, Paul (2000). The Age of Charles Martel. Pearson Education. , p. 96. Martel's forces used rope ladders and battering rams to attack the walls of Avignon, which was burned to the ground following its capture.Halsall, Guy (2003). Warfare and Society in the Barbarian West 450-900. London: Routledge. , p. 226.Mastnak, Tomaz (2002). Crusading Peace: Christendom, the Muslim World, and Western Political Order. University of California Press. , p. 101. The army then crossed the Rh√¥ne River into Septimania in order to lay siege to Narbonne. Fouracre, 2000, p. 97. This siege was part of the campaigns of 736-737 during which Charles Martel for the second time engaged Arab armies from Al-Andalus beyond the Pyrenees. Unlike the invasion of 732-733, the Arabs came this time by sea. Notable at these battles was the use of heavy cavalry in addition to Martel's vaunted veteran Frankish infantry. Though he had some catapults, the city of Avignon was largely taken by a simple, brutal, frontal assault using rams to smash through the gates, and ladders to scale the walls. Modern critical viewpoints Anthony Santosuosso, an expert in the Dark Ages and Medieval Europe, has argued that these events were as important macrohistorically as Martel's victory at the Battle of Tours. The campaigns, which ended with the complete destruction of a large Arab force, attempting to relieve Narbonne, at the Battle of the River Berre in 737, crushed any hope of expansion while the Umayyad Caliphate was still united, before the Battle of the Zab, at which the Umayyads were defeated by their Abbasid rivals. Santosuosso, Anthony (2004). Barbarians, Marauders, and Infidels. Westview Press. , p. 231. In Paul Fouracre's account, however, both the extent and the importance of Martel's victories are said to have been greatly exaggerated by Paul the Deacon and the Continuations of Fredegar in which Martel came to be depicted as the progenitor of later Frankish success and the Franks as \\"God's people\\".Fouracre, 2000, p. 88; p. 2. Other historians point to Charles' interests in the region, who in 736 had just occupied the Lyonnais and the Middle Rhone, and may have seen his newly conquered Burgundy in danger. At any rate, it seems apparent that the local magnates of Provence, ruling semi- autonomously, saw the impending danger coming from the north, and may have in turn called in the Muslim forces from bordering Septimania.

Many species had odd specialized grasping limbs and prehensile tails, adapted to arboreal (and possibly aquatic) lifestyles.  Description  The name \\"Avicephala\\" means \\"bird heads\\", in reference to the distinctive triangular skulls of these reptiles that mimic the shape of bird skulls. A few avicephalans, such as Hypuronector, even appear to have had pointed, toothless, bird-like beaks. This cranial similarity to birds has led a few scientists to theorize that birds descended from avicephalans like Longisquama, though a majority see the similarity simply as convergence. This similarity may also have led to the possible misidentification of the would-be \\"first bird\\", Protoavis.Renesto, S. (2000). \\"Bird-like head on a chameleon body: new specimens of the enigmatic diapsid reptile Megalancosaurus from the Late Triassic of northern Italy.\\" Rivista Italiana di Paleontologia e Stratigrafia, 106: 157‚Äì180. Abstract Avicephalans possessed a variety of odd and distinctive characteristics in addition to their bird-like skulls. Some displayed unique dermal appendages, such as the feather-like dorsal plumes of Longisquama, and the laterally-oriented rib-like rods of Coelurosauravus, which supported membranes and may have been used to glide from branch to branch in an arboreal habitat. Another avicephalan group, the drepanosaurids, featured a suite of bizarre, almost chameleon-like skeletal features. Above the shoulders of most species was a specialized \\"hump\\" formed from fusion of the vertebrae, possibly used for advanced muscle attachments to the neck, and allowing for quick forward-striking movement of the head (perhaps to catch insects). Many had derived hands with two fingers opposed to the remaining three, an adaptation for grasping branches. Some individuals of Megalancosaurus (possibly exclusive to either males or females) had a primate-like opposable toe on each foot, perhaps used by one sex for extra grip during mating. Most species had broad, prehensile tails, sometimes tipped with a large \\"claw\\", again to aid in climbing. These tails, tall and flat like those of newts and crocodiles, have led some researches to conclude that they were aquatic rather than arboreal. In 2004, Senter dismissed this idea, while Colbert and Olsen, in their description of Hypuronector, state that while other drepanosaurs were probably arboreal, Hypuronector was uniquely adapted to aquatic life.Senter, P. (2004). \\"Phylogeny of Drepanosauridae (Reptilia: Diapsida).\\" Journal of Systematic Palaeontology, 2(3): 257-268. The tail of this genus was extremely deep and non-prehensile ‚Äì much more fin-like than other drepanosaurs.Colbert, E. H., and Olsen, P. E. (2001). \\"A new and unusual aquatic reptile from the Lockatong Formation of New Jersey (Late Triassic, Newark Supergroup).\\" American Museum Novitates, 3334: 1-24. History of classification Rautiania. Longisquama. Megalancosaurus. The various avicephalan groups have been difficult to pin down in terms of their phylogenetic position. Some of these enigmatic reptiles, specifically the drepanosaurids and Longisquama, have been assigned by some researches to the Prolacertiformes.Renesto, S. (1994). \\"Megalancosaurus, a possibly arboreal archosauromorph (Reptilia) from the Upper Triassic of northern Italy.\\" Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 14(1): 38-52. Senter, however, found them to form a group with the coelurosauravids, for which he coined the name Avicephala, as a sister taxon to Neodiapsida (the group which includes all modern diapsids and their extinct relatives). Within Avicephala, Senter named the group Simiosauria (\\"monkey lizards\\") for the extremely derived tree-dwelling forms. Simiosauria was defined as \\"all taxa more closely related to Drepanosauridae than to Coelurosauravus or Sauria.\\" However, Renesto and colleagues (see below) found drepanosaurids to lie within Sauria, which would make the clade Simiosauria obsolete. Senter found that Hypuronector, originally described as a drepanosaurid, actually lies just outside that family, along with the primitive drepanosaur Vallesaurus. He also recovered a close relationship between the drepanosaurs Dolabrosaurus and Megalancosaurus. The following cladogram was found by Senter in his 2004 analysis. Renesto et al. (2010)Silvio Renesto, Justin A. Spielmann, Spencer G. Lucas, and Giorgio Tarditi Spagnoli. (2010). The taxonomy and paleobiology of the Late Triassic (Carnian-Norian: Adamanian-Apachean) drepanosaurs (Diapsida: Archosauromorpha: Drepanosauromorpha). New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin. 46:1‚Äì81 demonstrated that Senter (2004) cladogram was based on poorly defined characters and dataset. The resulting phylogeny was therefore very unusual compared to any other previous study on drepanosaurs or related taxa. The new cladogram proposed in this last study abandoned both Avicephala (because it is polyphyletic) and Simiosauria, redefining the latter under the PhyloCode as Drepanosauromorpha. Drepanosauromorphs are closely related to the Prolacertiformes, especially genera like Langobardisaurus and Macrocnemus, if not part of the Prolacertiformes. Among the drepanosauromorphs it was defined a more inclusive taxon, Elyurosauria (\\"lizard with coiled tails\\"), in order to include all the drepanosaurs with coiled tails, Vallesaurus is thus more derived than Hypuronector (as clearly shown by its morphology). Drepanosaurus and Megalancosaurus are also in a new taxon named Megalancosaurinae. The alternative cladogram as presented in Renesto et al. (2010).

They are found worldwide in tropical to warm temperate zones. The family includes about 143 species. Taxonomy The relationships of this family are not yet clear. Two of the genera, Gogo and Ancharius, have been moved to a separate family called Anchariidae. The Ariidae are divided into three subfamilies: Galeichthys is the only genus classified in the subfamily Galeichthyinae and similarly Bagre is the only genus in the subfamily Bagreinae, while the rest of the genera are classified in the subfamily Ariinae. Previously, the family Ariidae has been grouped in the superfamily Doradoidea, but then it was moved into Bagroidea (along with Austroglanididae, Claroteidae, Schilbeidae, Pangasiidae, Bagridae, Malapteruridae, and Pimelodidae. It has also been classified in a superfamily Arioidea containing Ariidae and Anchariidae. Distribution and habitat Ariids are found worldwide in tropical to warm temperate zones. Ariids are unusual among catfish in that they live primarily in the sea; the majority of catfish families are strictly freshwater and have little tolerance for brackish or marine conditions. Ariid catfish are found in shallow temperate and tropical seas around the coastlines of North and South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Many other species of catfish are also present in freshwater habitats; some species only occur in freshwater. In North and South America, about 43 species extend into brackish water or are found exclusively in fresh water. Appearance and anatomy Ariid catfish have a deeply forked caudal fin. Usually, three pairs of barbels are present. They possess some bony plates on their heads and near their dorsal fins. At least some species have venomous spines in their dorsal and pectoral fins. =Skull= The left image has Vitruvian Man superimposed where Jesus is said to be depicted in an ariid catfish skull, while the right image is simply the skull. In the upper left hand corner, the small black line provides a scale of . The gaff top sail catfish is sometimes called crucifix catfish because their dried skulls bones resemble a cruciform man. This is an example of pareidolia. The Crucifix Catfish by Allan James Ecology Beyond their maritime habitat, ariid catfish have a number of unique adaptations that set them apart from other catfish. Most, if not all species, are mouthbrooding fish, with the male carrying a small clutch of a few dozen, tiny eggs for about two months until the eggs hatch and the fry become free-swimming.Ariopsis felis Relationship to humans One well-known ariid catfish is the hardhead catfish, Ariopsis felis, abundant along the Western Atlantic coast from Massachusetts to Mexico. Although hardhead catfish reach a weight of about and are edible, they have a mixed reputation as game fish and are often considered nuisance bait stealers. A less-abundant species, more highly regarded as a game and food fish, is the gafftopsail catfish, Bagre marinus. The range of the gafftop extends further south, to Venezuela. The smaller ariid catfishes have minor value as public and home aquarium fish. In 1972, the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago received worldwide acclaim for the first successful breeding of Ariopsis felis in captivity, a feat they have repeated several times since. The Colombian shark catfish Sciades seemanni (until recently Hexanematichthys seemanni) is a fairly popular aquarium fish, though it has been traded under a variety of spurious names, such as Arius jordani and Arius seemani.Hexanematichthys seemanni Less commonly traded aquarium species include Arius berneyi and Arius graeffei.The catfish family Ariidae References Category:Catfish families Category:Taxa named by Lev Berg ","title":"Ariidae"},{"id":"5065298","text":"Rena Galibova (Russian: –†–µ–Ω–∞ –ê–±—Ä–∞–º–æ–≤–Ω–∞ –ì–∞–ª–∏–±–æ–≤–∞, Tajik: –†–∞—ä–Ω–æ –ê–±—Ä–∞–º–æ–≤–Ω–∞ “í–æ–ª–∏–±–æ–≤–∞) (May 24, 1915 - September 10, 1995) was a Tajik actress and opera singer who was named the People's Artist of Tajikistan.

Adopted in 1907, Oklahoma ratified the United States Constitution on November 16, 1907, as the 46th U.S. state. At its ratification, the Oklahoma Constitution was the most lengthy governing document of any government in the U.S. All U.S. state constitutions are subject to federal judicial review; any provision can be nullified if it conflicts with the U.S. Constitution. The constitution has been regularly amended, beginning with an amendment approved in the same election in which it was ratified.Goble, Danny, \\"Government and Politics,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (accessed June 23, 2010). More than 150 constitutional amendments have been approved by Oklahoma voters. History Cartoonist's rendering of Theodore Roosevelt's initial reaction to the Oklahoma Constitution. From 1890 onward, the land that now forms the State of Oklahoma was made up of the Oklahoma Territory (to the west), and the Indian Territory (to the east). Indian Territory, as its name suggests, had a large Native American population; the territory itself had been reduced over time to its then size. =Sequoyah Constitutional Convention= The movement to secure statehood for Indian Territory began in 1902 with a convention in Eufaula, consisting of representatives of the \\"Five Civilized Tribes\\". The representatives met again in 1903 to organize a constitutional convention. The Sequoyah Constitutional Convention met in Muskogee, on August 21, 1905.Mize, Richard, \\"Sequoyah Convention ,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. (accessed March 2, 2014) General Pleasant Porter, Principal Chief of the Creek Nation, was selected as president of the convention. The elected delegates decided that the executive officers of the Five Civilized Tribes would also be appointed as vice-presidents: William Charles Rogers, Principal Chief of the Cherokees; William H. Murray, appointed by Chickasaw Governor Douglas H. Johnston to represent the Chickasaws; Chief Green McCurtain of the Choctaws; Chief John Brown of the Seminoles; and Charles N. Haskell, selected to represent the Creeks (as General Porter had been elected President). The convention drafted a constitution, drew up a plan of organization for the government, put together a map showing the counties to be established, and elected delegates to go to the United States Congress to petition for statehood. The convention's proposals were then put to a referendum in Indian Territory, in which they were overwhelmingly endorsed. The delegation received a cool reception in Washington. Eastern politicians, fearing the admission of two more Western states, and no doubt unwilling to admit an \\"Indian\\" state, put pressure on the U.S. President, Theodore Roosevelt, who finally ruled that the Indian and Oklahoma Territories would be granted statehood only as a combined state. The hard work of the Sequoyah State Constitutional Convention was not entirely lost, however. When representatives from Indian Territory joined the Oklahoma State Constitutional Convention in Guthrie the next year, they brought their constitutional experience with them. The Sequoyah Constitution served in large part as the basis for the constitution of the State of Oklahoma, which came into being with the merger of the two territories in 1907. =List of Prominent Delegates to the Sequoyah Convention= *William H. Murray (Constitutional Convention President, ninth Governor of Oklahoma, first Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives) *Charles N. Haskell (first Governor of Oklahoma) *Robert L.

Buchanan (President of the University of Oklahoma) =Oklahoma Constitutional Convention= The final nail in the coffin of the proposed State of Sequoyah was an Enabling Act passed by Congress on June 6, 1906 that provided for a single state to be created from the so-called \\"Twin Territories.\\" The act further specified that elections would be held in both territories on November 6, 1906 to elect delegates for a constitutional convention. Each territory was to elect 55 delegates. The Osage Nation was allowed two delegates, giving a total of 112 delegates.Adkison, Danny M. \\"Constitutional Convention.\\" Accessed November 23, 2017. The Oklahoma Constitutional Convention opened in Guthrie on November 20, 1906. William H. Murray was elected chairman of the convention. Charles N. Haskell was elected the majority floor leader by the Democrats, and Henry Asp was elected minority floor leader by the Republicans. William Jennings Bryan came to encourage the delegates to write, \\"the very best constitution ever written.\\" Bryan proposed that they accomplish this by consulting previously written state constitutions. The delegates not only complied, but also consulted the proceedings of the Sequoyah Convention, and the U.S. Constitution. Having completed a draft document, they adjourned March 15, 1907. There were two additional week-long sessions called to finish the draft before it was put before the voters on September 17, 1907. Eligible voters approved their new Constitution a 71 percent yes vote. Satisfied with the proposed document, President Theodore Roosevelt signed the necessary papers November 16, 1907, and announced, \\"Oklahoma is now a state.\\" Preamble The Oklahoma Constitution Preamble reads: : Invoking the guidance of Almighty God, in order to secure and perpetuate the blessing of liberty; to secure just and rightful government; to promote our mutual welfare and happiness, we, the people of the State of Oklahoma, do ordain and establish this Constitution. Article of the Constitution The remainder of the constitution consists of twenty-nine articles, with the first eight pertaining to the state‚Äôs government. =Federal Relations= Article One establishes how the state of Oklahoma is to relate to the United States federal government, stating that the US Constitution is the Supreme Law of the Land. By this article, religious freedom is established, polygamy is forbidden, the debts of Oklahoma Territory are acquired by the State of Oklahoma, public school are established to be taught only in English, and that suffrage shall never be revoked due to ‚Äúrace, color, or previous condition of servitude.‚Äù =Bill of Rights= Article Two enumerates the rights of all citizens of the State of Oklahoma. These include that all political power derives from the people, the inherent rights ‚Äúto life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and the enjoyment of the gains of their own industry,‚Äù the right to peaceful assembly, a ban on the interference with suffrage, the definition of treason, the right to trial by jury, that marriage in the State of Oklahoma is defined as being between a man and a woman, and many others. The right of a citizen to keep and bear arms in defense of his home, person, or property, or in aid of the civil power, when thereunto legally summoned, shall never be prohibited; but nothing herein contained shall prevent the Legislature from regulating the carrying of weapons. =Suffrage= Article Three deals with suffrage in the State of Oklahoma. All peoples of the age of 18 are qualified electors in the state and a State Elector Board is established charged with the supervision of such elections as the Legislature shall direct. No elector in Oklahoma may vote in any election unless previously registered to do so with the state, and all elections must be ‚Äúfree and equal,‚Äù as no ‚Äúpower, civil or military, shall ever interfere to prevent the free exercise of the right of suffrage,‚Äù and ‚Äúelectors shall be privileged from arrest during their attendance on elections and while going to and from the same‚Äù except in cases of treason against the state. =Separation of Powers= Article Four established the Government of Oklahoma under the doctrine of separation of powers and reads: :The powers of the government of the State of Oklahoma shall be divided into three separate departments: The Legislative, Executive, and Judicial; and except as provided in this Constitution, the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial departments of government shall be separate and distinct, and neither shall exercise the powers properly belonging to either of the others. =Legislative power= Article Five establishes the legislative branch of government, Oklahoma Legislature, which includes the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Article establishes the manner of election and qualifications of members of each House, and includes a unique term limits provision in Section 17A: no member can serve more than 12 years total in the Legislature, whether in one chamber or in both chambers. In addition, it provides for free debate in the Legislature, limits self-serving behavior by Senators and Representatives, outlines legislative procedure and indicates the powers of the legislative branch. =Executive power= Article Six describes the governorship (the executive branch): procedures for the selection of the governor, qualifications for office, the oath to be affirmed and the powers and duties of the office. It also provides for the office of Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma, and specifies that the Lieutenant Governor succeeds to the governorship if the Governor is incapacitated, dies, or resigns. Other executive offices and departments created in the article are the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the State Treasurer, the State Auditor and Inspector, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Insurance Commissioner, the Commissioner of Labor, the Department of Mines, the Board of Agriculture, and the Commissioners of the Land Office. =Judicial power= Article Seven describes the court system (the judicial branch), which is unique in that it establishes two courts of last resort (only neighboring state Texas has a similar system). The Article vests the judicial power in a Supreme Court, a Court of Criminal Appeals, a Worker's Compensation Court, a Court of Tax Review, and such intermediate, trial level and municipal courts as the Legislature, at its discretion, may establish. As written in the Constitution, the Legislature is given the enumerated power to dissolve any court in Oklahoma at any time, except the Supreme Court. All civil judgments are reviewable by the Supreme Court and all criminal judgement are reviewable by the Court of Criminal Appeals. The Article also creates the Oklahoma Court of Impeachment (charged with removal all elected officials from office) and the Oklahoma Court on the Judiciary (charged with reviewing Justices and Judges). The Article continues to further describe how Justices and Judges are selected, and how and under what circumstances Justices and Judges are removed from office. =Impeachment= Article Eight states that all state elected offices, including Supreme Court Justices, are subject to impeachment for wilful neglect of duty, corruption in office, habitual drunkenness, incompetency, or any offense involving moral turpitude committed while in office. The Oklahoma House of Representatives must bring the charges against the individual with the Oklahoma Senate serving as the Court on Impeachment, with the Chief Justice of Oklahoma serving as the court's judge. If charged with impeachment and found guilty, the official‚Äôs term is immediately suspended. =Remaining Articles= *Article Nine - Corporations *Article Ten - Taxes and Revenue in General *Article Eleven - State and School Lands *Article Twelve - Homestead and Exemptions Article Twelve A - Homestead Exemption From Taxation *Article Thirteen - Education Article Thirteen A - Oklahoma State System of Higher Education Article Thirteen B - Board of Regents of Oklahoma Colleges *Article Fourteen - Banks and Banking *Article Fifteen - Oath of Office *Article Sixteen - Public Roads *Article Seventeen - Counties *Article Eighteen - Municipal Corporations *Article Nineteen - Insurance *Article Twenty - Manufacture and Commerce *Article Twenty-one - Public Institutions *Article Twenty-two - Alien and Corporate Ownership of Lands *Article Twenty-three - Miscellaneous *Article Twenty-four - Constitutional Amendments The Oklahoma Constitution permits three methods of amendment: 1) amendments by the Oklahoma Legislature (requires majority vote of both houses and approval by majority of the voters at next general election; the Legislature can by 2/3 vote place the amendment on a special election), 2) constitutional convention (a call for such requires majority voter approval before the convention is held, and any amendments or new constitution requires majority voter approval, but such a call must be made at least once every 20 years), or 3) via an initiative petition. *Article Twenty- five - Social Security *Article Twenty-six - Department of Wildlife Conservation *Article Twenty-seven - Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (repealed) *Article Twenty-eight - Alcoholic Beverage Laws And Enforcement *Article Twenty-nine - Ethics Commission *Article Thirty - Official Actions of the State of Oklahoma The final section of the Oklahoma Constitution deals with laws and other ordinances in place in the Territory of Oklahoma before its admission to the Union in 1907. Section Attestations The Oklahoma Constitution ends with the officers and delegates to the Constitutional Convention signing the documents.

Dessima D Williams is a Grenadian diplomat and former Ambassador to the United Nations from Grenada who was reappointed to the ambassadorship in 2008. She was a professor of sociology, development and gender at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts as well as serving as the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) chair during COP15 in Copenhagen (2009-2011). She is currently a Strategic Adviser to Oxfam on climate change. Dr. Williams holds a Ph.D. from American University and a bachelor's degree from the University of Minnesota. She is also the founder and Director of the Grenada Education and Development Programme (GRENED).  Personal life  Dessima Williams works in her own country to highlight the challenges of Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) for the education of rural boys and girls. She is a passionate organic farmer and an enthusiastic exponent of a non-toxic lifestyle, especially to reduce the use of plastics. She promotes a sustainable lifestyle through diet, walking rather than driving where possible, and letting others know about the SDGs.  Education  Dr. Williams holds a Ph.D. and a master's degree in International Relations from American University. She has a bachelor's degree in International Relations from the University of Minnesota.  Career  In the 1980s, Dessima served as Grenada's representative to the Organization of American States, Deputy Governor to the World Bank and Deputy Permanent Representative to the Inter- American Commission of Women. At the Organization of American States, she shepherded resolutions such as the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace, Development and Independence and promotion of small island states. At 32 years of ages she was named ambassador to the United States by Grenada's Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, whose murder Aug. 12, 1983, set off a bloody power struggle on the island nation that led to the US invasion of Grenada. The Reagan administration refused to accept her credentials as ambassador. On October 25, 1984 Dessima Williams was arrested by INS agents in Washington while Ronald Reagan was in the White House celebrating the first anniversary of his invasion of the tiny island. The agents of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service apprehended her as she was leaving a forum on \\"Peace in the Americas\\" at Howard University. Of the arrest Willams said: \\"I had just made the keynote address at a conference on Peace in the Caribbean at Howard University. As I left, about six men suddenly approached me. They indicated I was under arrest and that I should get into the car. I had already been pushed against the open door. I was standing there, baffled: \\"Why have I been arrested and what is this all about?\\" The men‚Äîthey were armed‚Äîtried to keep people away from me. Then one fellow grabbed me by the neck from behind and the other one pushed his hand in my pelvic area and the other hand on my head, and they crumpled me into the car. All I knew was that there were these aggressive, hostile white males speeding off with me in a civilian car. We eventually arrived at a jail, and a woman matron began to search me. She found some little buttons that said, \\"Maurice Bishop's Spirit Lives.\\" She said, \\"They're weapons. They have sharp points.\\" I had a lot of foreign currency from years of travelling. \\"These are very important documents.\\" I was put in a tiny cell and released on bail in the morning. The charge was that I was living here illegally. In fact, I'd been going back and forth from Grenada for eleven or twelve years.\\" Dessima has taught at secondary, college and university levels and is an advocate for the rights of women and girls, for farmers and for rural development. She founded the Grenada Education and Development Programme, which supports Grenada's students as emerging leaders. She has also owned a business in the tourism sector. Dr Williams taught Political Science at Williams College in Massachusetts before joining the faculty of Brandeis University 1992. In 2009, she returned to diplomacy as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Grenada to the United Nations, serving for over four years, three of those concurrently as Chair of the Alliance of Small Island Developing States. In this capacity, she led a 40-island global climate change effort that recorded the high ambition of keeping average global temperatures to 1.5 degrees in the Copenhagen Accord of 2009, which was later included in the 2015 Paris Agreement. In 2016 Dessima Williams was appointed as Special Adviser for Implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals at the United Nations. Williams is in charge of the team for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in the office of the President of the General Assembly for the 71st session. Her leadership secured early investment for the island renewable energy organization, SIDS-DOCK. Dessima has participated in numerous sustainable development and political meetings, including Rio+20 and the first and third United Nations Conferences on Small Island Developing States.

It is also known in some sources as valley pocket gopher, particularly in California. Both the specific and common names of this species honor Paul-√âmile Botta, a naturalist and archaeologist who collected mammals in California in 1827 and 1828. Description Elliot 1901 Botta's pocket gopher is a medium-sized gopher, with adults reaching a length of , including a tail of . The overall dental formula is . Males are larger, with a weight of , compared with in the females. Male pocket gophers are widely believed to continue growing throughout their life. However, size variation would indicate that some males are predisposed to be larger than others, and the largest male may not be the oldest. Coloration is highly variable, and has been used to help distinguish some of the many subspecies; it may also change over the course of a year as the animals molt. Both albino and melanistic individuals have also been reported. However, Botta's gopher generally lacks the black stripe down the middle of the back found in the closely related southern pocket gopher, a feature that may be used to tell the two species apart where they live in the same area. Distribution Botta's pocket gophers are found from California east to Texas, and from Utah and southern Colorado south to Mexico. Within this geographical area, they inhabit a range of habitats, including woodlands, chaparral, scrubland, and agricultural land, being limited only by rocky terrain, barren deserts, and major rivers. They are found at elevations up to at least . Skeletal remains of Botta's pocket gophers, dating back 31,000 years, have been identified from Oklahoma. Around 195 subspecies have been described, mostly on the basis of geographical distribution. Some of these have previously been described as distinct species in their own right. The distribution of the type localities of these subspecies is as follows: * California - 43 (including the nominate subspecies) * Oregon - 2 (both in the extreme south of the state) * Nevada - 16 * Utah - 20 * Arizona - 43 * New Mexico - 15 * Colorado - 4 * Texas - 10 (all in the western region of the state) * Baja California - 16 * Baja California Sur - 8 * Sonora - 8 * Chihuahua - 2 * Coahuila - 6 * Sinaloa - 2 (both in the extreme north of the state) Ecology Botta's pocket gopher is strictly herbivorous, feeding on a variety of plant matter. Shoots and grasses are particularly important, supplemented by roots, tubers, and bulbs during the winter. An individual often pulls plants into the ground by the roots to consume them in the safety of its burrow, where it spends 90% of its life. The metabolic rate, consumption rate and amount of energy assimilated for non- reproductive adult gophers is consistent through winter, spring, summer and fall. The average adult Botta's pocket gopher has a body temperature of . Burrowing can be extremely energetically demanding requiring between 360 and 3,400 times as much energy as moving across the surface, depending on soil density. Due to the high cost of burrowing, Botta's pocket gopher is good at conserving energy by having a low basal metabolic rate and thermal conductance. The main predators of this species include American badgers, coyotes, long-tailed weasels, and snakes, but other predators include skunks, owls, bobcats, and hawks. This species is considered a pest in urban and agricultural areas due to its burrowing habit and its predilection for alfalfa; however, it is also considered beneficial as its burrows are a key source of aeration for soils in the region. Digging by Botta's pocket gophers is estimated to aerate the soil to a depth of about , and to be responsible for the creation of Mima mounds up to in height. Populations of the species have been estimated to mine as much as 28 tonnes of soil per hectare per year, much of which is moved below ground, rather than being pushed up into the mounds. The species also has been associated with the deaths of aspen in Arizona and creates patches of bare ground that may limit the establishment of new seedlings. Behavior An individual emerging from a burrow in southern California Botta's pocket gopher is highly adaptable, burrowing into a very diverse array of soils from loose sands to tightly packed clays, and from arid deserts to high altitude meadows. They are able to tolerate such a wide range of soils in part because they dig primarily with their teeth, which are larger and with a thicker layer of enamel than in claw-digging gophers. In comparison, gophers digging with their claws are generally only able to dig in softer soils, because their claws wear down more quickly than teeth do in harder materials. Botta's pocket gophers are active for a total of about nine hours each day, spending most of their time feeding in their burrows, but are not restricted to either daylight or night time. They make little sound, although they do communicate by making clicking noises, soft hisses, and squeaks. Their burrows include multiple deep chambers for nesting, food storage, and defecation, that be as much as below ground. A series of tunnels close to the surface is used for feeding on plant roots, with shorter side tunnels for disposal of excavated soil. On the surface, the burrows are marked by fan-shaped mounds of excavated soil, with the actual entrance usually kept filled in for protection. Population densities between 10 and 62 per acre have been reported. Aboveground traces of these burrows are sometimes called \\"gopher eskers\\". Outside of the breeding season, each burrow is inhabited by a single adult, with any young leaving once they are weaned. Male burrows extend over a mean area of , and those of females , but the gophers aggressively defend a larger exclusive area, of for males and for females, around the burrow entrance. Reproduction In areas with sufficient food, such as agricultural land, breeding can occur year-round, with up to four litters being born each year. In the north, and other, less hospitable, environments, it occurs only during the spring. The local habitat also affects the age at which females begin breeding, with nearly half doing so in their first year in agricultural land, but none at all in desert scrub. Females can breed within the same season they are born, or within three months of their birth. Males tend not to breed until the season after they are born, or at least until they are 6‚Äì8 months old. Gestation lasts 18 days, and results in the birth of a litter of up to 12 pups, although three or four are more typical. The young are born hairless and blind, and measure about in length. The first, silky coat of fur is replaced by a coarser coat of grey hair as the pups age, before the full adult coat develops. Botta's pocket gophers are capable of breeding with southern pocket gophers, and until the 1980s, were often considered to belong to the same species. However, male hybrids are sterile, and females have greatly reduced fertility, so rarely have offspring of their own. Hybridization with Townsend's pocket gopher has also been reported, and it, too, appears not to extend much beyond the first generation.

This star is a suspected astrometric binary, although nothing is known about the companion. This is a massive star, with about seven times the mass of the Sun. It is about 40 million years old and rotating rapidly; the projected rotational velocity has been measured as high as . The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of B3 IV, with the luminosity class of IV indicating this is likely a subgiant star that has nearly exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and is in the process of evolving into a giant star. In 1969, Chi Carinae was classified as chemically peculiar Ap star because its absorption lines of silicon appeared unusually strong relative to the lines for helium. However, subsequent examination in the ultraviolet band showed the silicon bands were as expected and it was determined the spectra is normal for a star of its type. There is no indication of variability in the star's spectrum. Observation during the Hipparcos mission showed no photometric variability down to a limit of ¬±0.003 magnitudes.

From 1958 until 2005 the company was known as Bajaj Tempo Motors, because it originated as a joint venture between Bachraj Trading Ltd. and Germany's Tempo.. The company is known for brands like the Tempo, Matador, Minidor and Traveller. Over the last five decades it has partnered with global manufacturers including Daimler, ZF, Bosch, and MAN. Force Motors is India‚Äôs largest van maker. The company is completely vertically integrated, making its own components for the entire product range. Force Motors ranks 327th (2016) amongst India's Fortune India 500 companies list. History Bajaj Tempo Minidor Tempo Bajaj Matador (Hanomag / Mercedes-Benz License of Harburger Transporter) Force Trax Aside from manufacturing light transport vehicles, Force Motors also makes engines and axles, as well as a large variety of die-cast aluminium parts. The foundation of Bajaj Tempo originates with the Bachraj Trading company, which was established in 1945. Bachraj started assembling three-wheeled Tempo auto rickshaws and small trucks in 1951, under license from Germany. In 1958 the companies announced the creation of a joint venture, called Bajaj Tempo Motors, with 26 percent of the shares belonging to Tempo. In 1968 the Firodia Group took a majority stake in Bajaj Tempo. In 1971 Tempo (Germany) passed into the hands of Daimler-Benz, who retained a 16.8 percent share in Bajaj Tempo until 2001. Daimler sold its stake in April 2001 after 43 years citing little synergy between the two companies. The Tempo Matador was the first diesel light commercial vehicle in India. The company started production of the Hanseat 3-Wheelers in collaboration with Vidal & Sohn Tempo Werke Germany in 1958. The word Tempo (a registered trade mark of Daimler) is now generic for any small goods carrier in India. A Force Traveller Ambulance, used by Narayana Health In 1987, Force Motors set up a new plant at Pithampur in Madhya Pradesh, for the production of Tempo Traveller. This plant was designed and built to the specification of Daimler-Benz. In 1997, Daimler asked it to set up a dedicated facility for assembling and testing engines for Mercedes passenger cars to be made in India. In 2005 the company was renamed Force Motors. Force Motors signed technology sourcing agreements in 2003 with MAN SE for which payments were made up front. On completion of the localization of the licensed technology and with the request from MAN, a joint venture was created forming MAN Force Trucks Pvt. Ltd to manufacture the full range of HCVs from 16t GVW to 49t GCW. MAN proceeded to buy out Force and MAN Trucks India was established as a separate concern in 2012. In 2012, Force Motors launched Traveller 26, a monocoque panel van that can seat 26 persons, designed entirely in-house. It has disk brakes on all four wheels and also comes with safety features like ABS and EBD. In 2015, the company was awarded a contract by BMW, resulting in a new facility in Chennai which produces and test engines and transmissions exclusively for all BMW cars and SUVs made in India. This plant can produce up to 20,000 engines per year. A new plant was inaugurated at Chakan, Pune in June 2016. This facility assembles and tests engines for all Mercedes Cars and SUVs made in India. The new plant has a current annual capacity of 20,000 engines and 20,000 front and rear axles. Force Motors has a nationwide dealer presence.

Agnone is known for the manufacture of bells by the Marinelli Bell Foundry. The town of Agnone proper is complemented with other populated centers like Fontesambuco, Villa Canale and Rigaini. History =Samnites= The Samnites comprised several distinct tribes in Samnium, a wholly inland district of south central Italy named after them. The Pentri tribe of the Samnites was the most powerful and based in Bovianium, which was a city some south of present Agnone. Agnone is in the center of important archaeological vestiges of the old Oscan-Samnite civilization and has been called ‚Äúthe Athens of the Sannio‚Äù due to the large number of ancient ruins of the Samnite culture.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography. William Smith, LLD. London. Walton and Maberly, Upper Gower Street and Ivy Lane, Paternoster Row; John Murray, Albemarle Street. 1854. According to tradition, the name of Agnone derives from the old city of Aquilonia that was destroyed by the Romans. The Samnites were soundly defeated by the consuls Carvilius and Lucius Papirius Cursor in 293 B.C. Papirius, after making himself master of Aquilonia, which he burnt to the ground, proceeded to besiege Saepinum, on his way to Bovianum. The Oscan Tablet in the British Museum. Agnone also lays claim to the most important ancient document found in Molise, the so-called \\"Oscan Tablet\\" (‚ÄúTabula Osca‚Äù), an inscription written in Oscan on a bronze tablet and dated to the 3rd century BC, now in the British MuseumBritish Museum Collection . The small bronze tablet was discovered in 1848 at Fonte di Romito, between Capracotta and Agnone, near the river Sangro. It provides an example of the most southerly dialect of the Samnite language. The tablet speaks of a series of dedications to different deities or holy beingsA Critical and Historical Introduction to the Ethnography of ancient Italy, by John William Donaldson, London, John W. Parker and Son, 1852. =Romans= During the Roman Period, Christianity was spread to Molise. Agnone appears on Roman maps under different regions at various times as Aprutium, Picenum, Sabina et Samnium, Flaminia et Picenum and/or Campania et Samnium. The Roman penchant for building seems to have passed Agnone over as Samnitic architecture still prevailed. =Medieval= Agnone was an important center during the rule of the Lombards, but then was left decaying in the centuries immediately preceding 1000, while the Verrino Valley and surrounding hills became a place of hermitages, monasteries and small agricultural colonies. In 1139 the powerful Borrello family, supported by soldiers of fortune from Venice, probably originating from colonies Dalmatian of the \\"Serenissima\\" took control of Agnone.Italy, by Dana Facaros, Michael Pauls 2004 The importance of Agnone grew during the Angevin and also in the Aragonese reigns to the point that during the reign of the Bourbons of the Two Sicilies, the city was among the 56 royal towns, that reported directly to the King, and was free from any other type of feudal subjection. Joseph Bonaparte decided to create the region Molise, that was to exclude Agnone, but during the reign of Joachim Murat, the elders of Agnone asked and obtained the transition to Molise, basing the request on the geographical difficulties of the links to Abruzzo, and hoping to rise to a new role for the small region. During this period, the natural resources surrounding Agnone impacted its economy where skilled craftsmen produced gold jewelry, copperware, watches, and bells. =Post-Unification= Agnone would suffer a significant decline in years following the Unification of Italy in the 1860s. In 1884 the local newspaper L'Aquilonia reviewed the causes of emigration of peasants from Agnone and concluded that the two main factors were excessive taxes on consumers' goods and usurious interest rates that at times surpassed 20 percent in the town.Emigration in a south Italian town: an anthropological history. William A. Douglass 1984 The peasants were arrested for stealing the crops of the galantuomini (\\"gallant men\\" or ruling class), and a particularly frequent crime was the illegal cutting of timber on the town commons. In 1863, for example, the authorities actually prosecuted 624 cases of illegal felling of trees. Consequently, when by the 1870s, owing to improvements in sea travel, a lowering of fares, and the expansive nature of the economies of both the United States and the Rio de la Plata region of southern South America, transatlantic emigration became a viable alternative, the lower classes of Agnone were, out of a sense of desperation, prime candidates. Politically alienated by decades of unfulfilled promises of land reform, mired in endemic poverty, dependent on a rapacious class of galantuomini for what was, by any yardstick, a meager existence, the peasantry was further squeezed by relentless population increase throughout the first seven decades of the 19th century.Emigration in a south Italian town: an anthropological history . William A. Douglass 1984 =World War II to present= When Benito Mussolini's fascist regime came to power, they effectively put a stop to Italy's out migration. During the Fascist era, Agnone was the site of exile for many opponents of the ruling party, including Don Raimondo Viale, protagonist of \\"The Just Priest\\" by Nuto Revelli. The Germans sat up a concentration camp in Molise for gypsies where Father Viale tried to help them. The War would finally reach Agnone in December 1943, as the Allied Forces would land on Italy's Adriatic coast and make their way northward and westward to Rome. The 1st Canadian Infantry Division would drive the Germans and Fascists out of Molise, and on 2 and 3 December, the West Nova Scotia Regiment would billet in Agnone during the Ortona offensive.Ortona: Canada's Epic World War II Battle By Mark Zuehlke After the war, Agnone's out migration issues continued, although more for reasons of economic availability. As international emigration declined, southern Italians migrated to industrial northern Italy for more promising economic prospects.The South Italian Family: a Critique. Journal of Family History 1980; 5; 338 William A. Douglass Presently, Agnone's population is still declining. As Molise is starting to find recognition as a tourist destination, Agnone is marketing itself on the agritourism market and for its unique Pre-Roman and Medieval architecture. Main sights =Medieval sights= The town's medieval-style architecture is reflected in its nineteen churches, including the Church of San Marco, with a large Renaissance portal embellished by a copper lion. In the 11th century Odorisio and Gualtiero Borrello introduced the cult of Saint Mark and brought artists from Venice to decorate their homes with Saint Mark's lion. This church is adorned with great artwork including: rich altars, a painting of a Holy Family and Saints by Luca Giordano; an obstensory in gilded copper and enamel, by Giovanni da Agnone, a disciple of Nicola da Guardiagrele. The church of Sant'Antonio Abate has a Romanesque portal and a 17th-century bell tower, and on the vault inside a giant fresco by Francesco Palumbo. Sant'Emidio has a 12th-century portal and rich works of art including wooden painted statues that are taken out on Good Thursday and Friday for a re-enactment of the Last Supper. The church of Corso Garibaldi, is sided by ancient houses with stone lions near the doors (the lion is on Agnone coat of arms), ancient artisans' workshops, Apollonio house and Nuonno house. Church of San Francesco displays a giant round window over the portal, dated 1330. Inside, the Final Judgment on the vault is painted by Gambora. The Church of San Nicola has a peculiar bell tower coated with yellow and green ceramic tiles. It is due to Agnone‚Äôs craftsmen and medieval architecture that the town adopted the nickname Citt√† d'Arte (City of Art) which the town uses on a promotional basis.The Palladino Family in America: Descendants of Pietrantonio Palladino. Peter August Hoetjes =Pontificia Fonderia Marinelli= The Marinelli Bell Museum. The Pontificia Fonderia Marinelli (the Marinelli Pontifical Foundry) is an ancient factory of bells which has been operating in Agnone for nearly a millennium. It ranks as one of the oldest companies in the world, where the Marinelli family has run the foundry for the last 1000 years. This factory has a museum, where bells of almost a thousand years of antiquity to more recent others are displayed. It is also possible to observe the artisan process of the manufacturing of bells. The factory was visited by the Pope John Paul II in 1995 as many of the foundry‚Äôs bells can be found at the Vatican. Geography Agnone lies on a rocky spear in the mountainous regions of Molise (Alto Molise). Farms and country houses surround the city at elevations varying from above sea level of the Verrino River bed to at Monte Castelbarone. The Sangro River also passes by Agnone. Its geographic position has been described as \\"the natural capital of the Alto Molise\\". Its territorial extension covers made up of forests, pastures and agriculture land. From a geomorphological point of view, the area is affected by several landslides. For example, in January 2003, a huge landslide occurred in the municipality of Agnone causing important damage to infraestructures. Culture The 'Ndocciata torchlight parade On Christmas Eve Agnone holds the \\"Carnevale Agnonese\\", including the Ndocciata, which is a huge torchlight parade of thousands of handmade, wooden torches made into nine different quarters (\\"borgate\\"), accompanied by the sound of bagpipes, to the Piazza Plebiscito where a brotherhood bonfire is lit. The Fiera delle Arti e Mestieri Antichi (Arts and Antique Crafts Fair) is held 17 to 19 August where a large area of the old town home to artisans, display their works. Artisan's crafts at the fair generally include goldsmiths, tinkers, tanners, wrought-iron, lace and embroidery.

This large grass airfield is best known for its association with the Air Transport Auxiliary from 1940 to 1945 and also has a significant history of prewar flying training, wartime and postwar RAF use and postwar use as a flight test centre by the Fairey and Westland aircraft companies. In the mid-1950s it was HQ of RAF Home Command. It is now privately owned and is the home of the West London Aero Club. Operational history The airfield was set up in 1928 when the de Havilland family bought of grassland to house the de Havilland Flying School. In 1938 the airfield was taken over by the government, and during the Second World War was the home of the Air Transport Auxiliary between its formation in early 1940 and disbandment on 30 November 1945.Sturtivant, P.67 The ATA staged a unique Air Display and Air Pageant at White Waltham on 29 September 1945 which was opened by Lord Beaverbrook and featured a memorable static park of Allied and German aircraft and the flying included Alex Henshaw displaying a Seafire Mk45. After the war, the airfield was also used by Fairey Aviation and later Westland Helicopters, which assembled and tested aircraft built at their Hayes factory. These included the Fairey FB-1 Gyrodyne (1947), Fairey Jet Gyrodyne (1954), Fairey Ultralight (1955), Fairey Rotodyne (1957) & Westland Scout (1960) & Westland Wasp (1962). The prototype Fairey Gannet was first flown from Aldermaston but production aircraft were completed and first flown at White Waltham too and an example is currently stored at the airfield.

Until 2007 it was the base of Thames Valley & Chiltern Air Ambulance helicopter. Approximately 150 light aircraft are based at the airfield which, with three runways, is reportedly the largest grass airfield in civilian use in Europe. The airfield holds Civil Aviation Authority Public Use Aerodrome Licence Number P773, that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flight training. Non-aviation events On 24 June 1989, the Fairey Hangar, on the north side of the airfield, was the venue for one of the largest acid house raves to be held at that time. The Sunrise Midsummer Party was attended by over 11,000 ravers, and attracted about 1,000 vehicles. This caused tailbacks on the approach to the airfield. The Sun newspaper ran a headline \\"Ecstasy Airport\\" the next day. The home quarters of Carter's Steam Fair are adjacent to the airfield.

After serving in the Massachusetts General Court and United States House of Representatives, Robinson served three one-year terms as Governor of Massachusetts, notably defeating Benjamin Franklin Butler in the 1883 election. After leaving office, his most famous legal client was Lizzie Borden, notoriously accused of killing her father and stepmother. She was acquitted in a highly sensationalized trial. Born in Lexington and educated at Harvard, Robinson taught high school before becoming a lawyer. He gained a reputation as a fine Parliamentarian while serving in Congress. As governor, he promoted the passage of civil service reform legislation and labor-friendly wage and dispute-resolution laws. He aligned with the state's industrial leaders against public health advocates, and banned discrimination in the issuance of life insurance policies. As a lawyer, he gained notoriety for Borden's defense, and was criticized for defending fraudulent fraternal benefit societies. Early years George Washington Robinson was born in Lexington, Massachusetts to Charles and Mary (Davis) Robinson. The son of farmers, he attended Lexington Academy and Hopkins Classical School in Cambridge, and graduated from Harvard University in 1856.Gleason, p. 231 While at Harvard he was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity.Baird, p. 291 In 1855, he had his name legally changed to \\"George Dexter Robinson\\", supposedly because someone else in Lexington had a similar name to his.Gleason, p. 232 Although he had intended to study medicine, Robinson entered the teaching profession, serving as the principal of Chicopee High School in Chicopee, Massachusetts from 1856 to 1865. During this time, he engaged in some study of medicine. In 1865, he engaged in the study of law with his brother, and was admitted to the bar in 1866, opening a practice in Chicopee. Robinson entered politics in 1873, winning election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives as a Republican. He was then elected to the Massachusetts Senate in 1875, in each case representing Chicopee. He served on judiciary committees in both chambers, as well as a committee on constitutional amendments in the Senate. Robinson was one of a small number of legislators who refused free travel passes offered by the railroads. In 1876, Robinson was elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he served most of four terms. He gained a reputation in the chamber as an experienced Parliamentarian and debater. He sat on a number of committees, including the House Judiciary Committee, and was considered a \\"doer\\" who moved the business of the body forward. Governor While serving in Congress, Robinson was nominated to run for Governor of Massachusetts in 1883, against the colorful incumbent Democrat Benjamin Butler. He ran on a platform of civil service reform (seeking to deal with issues of patronage), and defeated Butler by 10,000 votes. Robinson served three terms, winning by wider margins against other opponents. He was generally regarded as a fiscal conservative. During his tenure, legislation was enacted banning discrimination in the issuance of life insurance policies. He proposed successful legislation to extend free public education to every student, and required that textbooks be provided to each student free of charge. He also signed legislation requiring that corporations pay workers weekly, and established the state's first Board of Arbitration, which resolved disputes between workers and employers.Rundell, p. 655 A civil service reform bill, at the time the strictest in the nation, passed in 1884. It required even laborers hired by state and municipal governments to have minimal certification from a civil service commission established for the purpose. This effectively reduced certain types of patronage dispensed by elected officials, and may have been a Republican move to curtail the growing power of predominantly Democratic Irish-American urban party bosses.Miller, pp. 341-354 An attempt to weaken the civil service reform, by exempting veterans from its requirements, was vetoed by Robinson in 1886.The Nation, June 23, 1887 One controversy that Robinson inherited from the Butler administration concerned the state's board of health, charity and lunacy. This board had been created by merging several previously independent boards, and Butler had appointed as its chairman an activist concerned with industrial pollution. Butler had made this appointment following criticism that its public health mission had been diluted by the merger. The state's textile and manufacturing interests, hostile to the board's calls for more significant pollution control legislation, prevailed on Robinson to replace the chairman with a more business-friendly choice. A petition campaign by activists followed, prompting Robinson to separate the public health functions into a separate board.Cumbler, pp. 120-125 Robinson refused to run for reelection in 1886, and resumed the practice of law in Springfield. He refused an offer from Grover Cleveland of a seat on the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887, and a seat on the Cherokee Commission from Benjamin Harrison in 1889. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1891.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory Later legal work In 1892, Robinson took on his most famous client, Lizzie Borden. Borden stood accused of the murder of her father and stepmother, and had been compelled to give testimony in the coroner's inquest into their deaths. Robinson's addition to her defense team may have been due to the fact that he had, while governor, appointed the presiding judge to the bench. He was able to get Borden's inconsistent inquest testimony excluded from the criminal trial (on the grounds that she had not been represented in those hearings), and was also able to cast significant doubt on the reliability of several witnesses to the events surrounding the murders. Borden was ultimately acquitted of the criminal charges, and Robinson was a highly visible presence in the media circus that attended the trial. Contemporary magazine drawing of the Borden trial; Robinson stands facing left, with Lizzie Borden seated Another well-known client that Robinson took on was the Order of the Iron Hall, nominally a fraternal benefit society founded in Indiana in 1881.Dunn, p. 362Bennett, p. 518 The organization was essentially a fraudulent investment vehicle that was a combination of a tontine (where increased benefits accrue to survivors as investors die) and a Ponzi scheme (where deposits of later investors are used to pay off earlier ones).Bennett, pp. 518-520 Tontines were illegal under Massachusetts insurance regulations, and the Iron Hall was threatened in 1887 with an injunction to stop doing business in the state.Massachusetts Insurance Department (1888), p. xxiii It hired Robinson to appear before the legislature, and he was able to secure legislative alteration to the statute governing fraternal societies that would permit continued operation.Massachusetts Insurance Department (1894), pp. xlvi-xlvii Iron Hall went into receivership in 1892, and the state insurance commissioner criticized Robinson for his defense of the organization in his reports, which he charged exacerbated the financial losses incurred by Iron Hall and similar organizations.Massachusetts Insurance Department (1884), p. xlvi (The Iron Hall was one of the more high-profile of a large number of similar investment schemes, in which the operators of the organization also frequently siphoned funds away in the guise of salaries and expenses.)See Bennett for descriptions and tactics used by operators of these schemes. Robinson remained a prominent lawyer until his death in Chicopee; he is buried in Chicopee's Fairview Cemetery. His law firm remains in business, and is now known as Robinson Donovan P.C. Family Robinson was married twice. The first marriage was in 1859 to Hannah Stevens, with whom he had one child before her death in 1864.

Founded in 1955, it was first situated on Penang Hill, moving to Gurney Drive and finally Batu Ferringhi in 2006. Uplands School is a multicultural, multiracial and multinational community whose aim it is to promote the School Motto: ‚ÄúRespect for Self. Respect for Others‚Äù. Overview Uplands occupies a five-and-a-half-acre site near to the sea in the tourist area of Batu Ferringhi, approximately eleven kilometres from George Town. Housed in new buildings from 2006, facilities include 36 classrooms, five laboratories, two drama rooms, two music rooms, two computer labs, an indoor multi purpose hall, a 25-metre outdoor swimming pool, and a games field. The school also provides firewalled wireless internet access for students and staff who use their own mobile computers at school. Students are mainly divided into thirteen year groups. The school curriculum incorporates the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme (PYP) for Years 1 to 6., a school developed program for Years 7 to 9, and a wide range of subject choices for the IGCSE (Years 10 to 11). In Years 12 and 13 Uplands students complete the highly regarded International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) German, French, Japanese, Mandarin and Malay are among the language subjects offered, and there is a strong ESL programme for pupils for whom English is not their first language. The maximum class size is 25. Over one-half of the staff are expatriate teachers, many with previous international experience. A Special Educational Needs Department caters for children with mild learning disabilities. Uplands has recently been accredited by the Council of International Schools (CIS), which is a membership community working collaboratively to shape international education through professional services to schools, higher education institutions, and individuals. The school is authorised to offer courses leading to the IB Diploma. Uplands has a student body that represents around 37 different countries. They number in the region of 700, between the ages of 4 and 19. Student boarding accommodation is available nearby for children of eight years and above. Year 1 to 6 students wear a green/khaki batik uniform with brown pants or skirts. Year 7 to 11 students wear green polo shirts with khaki skirts or trousers, while sixth formers only need to adhere to a black/white dress code. The school is split into four houses for academic and sporting activities; Crag (red), Hill (green), School (blue) and Kelawai (orange). Accreditation and membership Uplands is an IB World School, recognised and accredited by the following organisations: *Malaysian Ministry of Education (MME) *International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) *Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) *Edexcel International Examinations *The Council of International Schools (CIS) The school is also a member of the Federation of British International Schools in South East Asia (FOBISEA) and the Boarding Schools Association (BSA)..  History  = The Early Years 1955 - 1977 = The International School of Penang (Uplands) was established during the Emergency period in Malaysia‚Äôs history (1948-1960). During this time the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) were waging a guerilla war focussed on crippling Malaya‚Äôs economy by sabotaging rubber and oil palm estates, as well as tin mines. As the violence throughout the peninsula intensified the Executive Council of the Incorporated Society of Planters (ISP) set in motion a plan for a school in a secure location where they could educate their young children. A lease for Crag Hotel on Penang Hill was negotiated with the Penang State Government and considerable work was undertaken to prepare the dilapidated buildings for their first intake of nearly 60 boarders in the Easter Term of 1955. A number of new students were also absorbed from an existing small private school on the Hill which was called Uplands, a name which the new school adopted. As the school bell rang and classes began 2000 ft above sea level, accessible only by rickety funicular, the turmoil of the Emergency must have seemed a world away. Due in part to its seclusion, the School quickly became a cosy, self- sufficient and close-knit community, where everybody was regarded as family. School days were leisurely, with classes beginning at 9am in consideration for the teachers who had to commute up the Hill and walk over a mile from the train station to the School. Living on the Hill also came with other unique challenges. During the early years all laundry was done by hand, so uniforms and game kits were only changed once a week. ‚ÄúBy then, all items of clothing could have walked themselves and tiny red ants with a fiery bite had taken to hiding in the seams of our dresses‚Äù. All daily necessities such as food supplies had to be ordered from Georgetown and transported up to the School, first by funicular and then by a cart which was pulled by the School‚Äôs hardy auxiliary staff. As the water supply to the Hill was interrupted every now and then, the students would often have to resort to bucket baths and other water- saving tactics. In 1972, Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh visited Penang Hill as part of their Malaysia and Singapore tour. The Uplands community turned out in full force to welcome the Royal Highnesses who happily spent their time mingling and chatting with students and staff. = The Downtown Years 1977 - 2005 = After 22 remarkable years on the Hill, Uplands finally reached the limits of possible expansion. With the Communist threat now extinguished, the time had come for the school to move out of its isolation and bring its brand of quality education to the wider Penang community. In the 1950s, most of Uplands‚Äô students came from expatriate planter and mining families. By the 1970s, the school had a broader mix of students from different backgrounds, including more Malaysian students. In 1976, Uplands started to take in day students and opened its Secondary Department with seven students in Form 1. To cater to this expansion and new needs, the School made the strategic move from its hilltop haven to a new location on Kelawai Road. The move to sea level went without a hitch and on September 11 1977, the boarding house opened its doors, with lessons at the Kelawai Road campus beginning a day later. The Burma Road boarding house was a large mansion with five dormitories and two common rooms that accommodated about 60 boarders. The school campus on Kelawai Road started with eight classrooms and two small offices. Many missed the cool air and tranquillity of the Hill, but the move was also a cause for celebration. The new school had access to a huge sports field for regular and interschool matches, and the boarders were now allowed out on excursions to parks, movies and concerts. Predictably, with the move, the number of students increased even further, beginning a rapid era of growth for the school. From seven students in Form 1 in 1977, the numbers shot up to 70 by 1979. In 1980, in a proud moment for the school, Uplands first three candidates sat for their O-Level examinations. As Malaysia transitioned from a primary-sector focussed economy to a manufacturing economy from the early 1970s onwards, the change was also apparent in the School‚Äôs enrolment. By 1983, most of the students‚Äô parents were professionals or business people, with only ten percent from the planting community. Uplands became more and more multicultural and this diversity became a significant hallmark of the School that continues to the present day. > One feature of Uplands, which ought to be noticeable but isn‚Äôt, is the > number of nationalities represented here. We do not seem to be aware of each > other as Chinese, German, Indian, Swedish or whatever. Everyone is accepted > only as a person. - P.E Drury (Principal 1972-1984) The rapid expansion of the 1980s involved some ingenuity on the School‚Äôs part as it renovated and changed buildings to meet its expanding needs. By the mid-1980s the Junior School had moved over to the Burma Road house, which meant shifting the boarders to a new campus of three houses along York road, while the building along Kelawai Road housed the Senior School. Uplands‚Äô multi-campus years did not last long, as the school was able to successfully negotiate for the lease of the historic St Joseph‚Äôs Novitiate. The imposing Novitiate, behind the Senior building, was a former training institute run by the La Salle Brothers and had been unoccupied for 17 years. The ‚ÄúBig Move‚Äù took place in 1988 was a typical Uplands community affair as staff and senior pupils took the day off to pack up the School and cart boxes across the field to St Joseph‚Äôs Novitiate. Finally, the entire School - including the Junior and Senior Schools, and boarding facilities - was located n the same site for the first time since the School left Penang Hill. In academic matters, Uplands was also making huge strides befitting its position as one of the oldest and most established international schools in Penang and Malaysia. In addition to offering the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE), the School‚Äôs Sixth Form, offering Cambridge A-Level courses in the Sciences and Humanities, was officially launched in 1996. By 1999/2000, with a healthy population numbering over 600 students, the School marked two significant new academic achievements. The first was the receipt of authorisation from the International Baccalaureate Organisation to offer the prestigious IB Diploma Programme, making it one of only two international schools in Malaysia to offer this programme. Not one to rest on its laurels, Uplands also succeeded in obtaining accreditation by the European Council of International Schools (ECIS), the world‚Äôs oldest and largest association of international schools, as well as the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), giving it the distinction of being the first and only school in Malaysia. = Home Sweet Home 2006 - Present = For half a century, from its establishment right up until 2006, Uplands had always been housed in leased buildings, a situation that had deprived the school of a sense of permanence. In 1998, a memorandum of understanding was penned for a purpose-built school building to be located in Bukit Jambul. Unfortunately, the plans fell through and the start of the new millennium came and went with no news of an impending move insight. However, it wasn‚Äôt long after that the School was able to acquire land in Batu Ferringhi, and during the academic year 2000/2001 the Penang Municipal Council granted the School planning permission for the construction of its new campus. The new four-acre Uplands campus in Batu Ferringhi was finally launched in 2006 to much fanfare and a sense of accomplishment. The further construction and opening of F-Block on April 16, 2016 provided the School with additional classrooms, activity and assembly space. Although Uplands‚Äô journey to its current campus may have taken the ‚Äúroad less travelled‚Äù, The School‚Äôs commitment to quality education coupled with engaged pastoral care has never wavered from its earliest days up the Hill. School spirit and commitment to its motto ‚ÄúRespect for Self, Respect for Others‚Äù remain the driving force that has come to characterise Uplands students, past and present.

Robert Cunliffe Gosling DL (15 June 1868 ‚Äì 8 April 1922), was a Victorian-era footballer who played as a speedy inside forward for the renowned amateur clubs Old Etonians and the Corinthians. He captained the England team on one, possibly two, occasions (contemporary sources are inexact) and scored two goals. Described by Sir Frederick Wall, the long-serving Secretary of the Football Association, as \\"the richest man who ever played football for England\\", Gosling was the scion of a wealthy Essex family and was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. The oldest of seven brothers (and one of 14 children), four of whom played cricket for Eton against Harrow, he was, recalled the early sportswriter JAH Catton (\\"Tityrus\\"), \\"the most aristocratic-looking man I ever saw\\", a view concurred in by his England international colleague C.B. Fry, who described him as \\"the best-looking man of my acquaintance\\" and one of the players whose presence in the Corinthians' side contributed to \\"their reputation up North as a team of toffs\\". Gosling's bearing lent him an imposing presence on the football field. He looked, Wall recalled, \\"every inch the high-born... [his] carriage and gait would have done credit to a court Chamberlain at a levee\\", and was admirably built, being merely \\"bone and muscle, not soft flesh\\". His play, the F.A. man added, :\\"was superb ‚Äì all polish and perfection. He looked the gentleman he was, suave, kindly and never unfair. But let anybody tackle him and try to nudge him off the ball! After impact with his massive proportions, with the impetus of a fleet runner, the tackler knew what a charge meant. He would be inclined to shake himself like a dog, with the air of assuring himself that all his limbs were still attached and functioning.\\" Edward Grayson, the historian of the early amateur game, was another admirer of the England captain. \\"Well over six feet in height,\\" he wrote, :\\"and weighing nearly thirteen stone, he left his mark both at inside-right and inside-left, with his speed, passing and shooting from all angles that underlined the dribbling skill he had acquired from Eton's Field Game. His unselfishness and finesse no doubt gave him the wonderful knack of knowing how to keep his line together, a quality which England's selectors have unhappily found wanting in nearly all the inside-forwards with whom they have experimented since the Second World War. Gosling's play... was the very refinement of football, and effective football, too. Had any other club than Old Etonians claimed his service... he would have been exalted at football in the manner reserved by cricket idolaters for Lionel Palairet, Reggie Spooner and Victor Trumper.\\" Gosling was, moreover, invariably sportsmanlike in his approach to the game, and entirely lacked malice. It was this quality that led \\"Nudger\\" Needham, the Sheffield United and England professional, to describe him as \\"a heavy, but a gentle player\\". Having played football for Cambridge against Oxford in the Varsity Match of 1890, Gosling was awarded a total of five England caps between 1892 and 1895, and showed himself ‚Äì according to his contemporary G.O. Smith ‚Äì one of the outstanding international forwards of the day: a shade less talented than Steve Bloomer, perhaps, but far less inclined to keep the ball, and so easier to play with. Gosling also played first-class cricket for Cambridge and Essex between 1888 and 1896. After his retirement from sport, Cunliffe Gosling served as a Justice of the Peace in his home county, Essex, and in 1902 was appointed as High Sheriff of Essex and a deputy lieutenant of the county. He died in his bed, recorded Catton, leaving a fortune proved at over ¬£700,000 (¬£21,260,000 at current prices). References * Catton, J.A.H. (\\"Tityrus\\") (2006 reprint of 1926 original).

The hook of the song is its title, repeated, each time followed by an enthusiastic crowd cheering, \\"We love it!\\" Writing and recording Randy Newman in 1979 Following the release of his sixth album Born Again (1979), Newman heavily procrastinated writing songs for a follow-up album, and spent a good portion of the next four years relaxing at home with his family. Newman jokingly noted that because he often lounged by the pool, the gardener had to water around him. To counter this lackadaisical lifestyle, Newman rented a recording studio in Los Angeles in 1983, which did not have any telephones to distract him. In this studio Newman recorded a song called \\"Something to Sing About\\", in which the narrator arrogantly boasts about the suburban opulence around him. Album producer Lenny Waronker disliked \\"Something to Sing About\\" and opted not to include it on the singer's upcoming album. Although \\"Something to Sing About\\" was not used, the song's message of delusion and arrogance served as an inspiration for \\"I Love L.A.\\" Another source of inspiration came from a conversation Newman had with Eagles drummer Don Henley while on an airplane. Henley told him that he could no longer afford to charter Learjets, to which Newman sarcastically responded: \\"Jesus that's tough...you can't live on a million a year anymore\\". During the same flight, Henley suggested Newman should write a song about Los Angeles, as he was a native of the city. This conversation, as well as \\"Something to Sing About\\", not only served as the inspiration for \\"I Love L.A.\\", but also the themes of hedonism and disillusion found in the song's parent album Trouble in Paradise. \\"I Love L.A.\\" and the rest of the songs from Trouble in Paradise were recorded at Warner Bros. Recording Studios in Hollywood, with producers Waronker and Russ Titelman. Mark Linett served as the audio and mixing engineer, while Bobby Hata was the audio master. Several members of the rock band Toto provided groove instrumentation, and Waddy Wachtel played the rhythm guitar. Composition AllMusic's Matthew Greenwald believes \\"I Love \\"L.A.\\" is Newman's only attempt at writing an \\"anthem\\", as the song features an energetic and buoyant melody not commonly found in the singer's previous music. \\"I Love L.A.\\" begins with a soft opening verse, which features synthesizer and saxophone instrumentation. The opening verse borrows the melody of Rodgers and Hart's 1937 song \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\". Newman begins this verse by deriding New York City as a place where \\"people dressed like monkeys\\", and saying Chicago should be left to the \\"Eskimos\\". The soft verse then transitions to a more upbeat, pop rock driven melody, influenced by the sound of the Beach Boys. This influence is evidenced when Newman name-drops the band in the lyrics, as well as alluding to their 1963 song \\"Surfin' U.S.A.\\" Following the musical shift, the lyrics now depict Newman driving down Imperial Highway in Los Angeles with a \\"big nasty redhead\\" at his side. Newman sings about rolling down the windows and pulling back the top of his convertible as he feels the Santa Ana winds brush against him. He proceeds to name-drop several regions in Los Angeles such as South Bay and Westside, and how everyone in these regions are happy because the sun is shining. The chorus features Newman singing the phrase \\"I love L.A.\\" several times, while Christine McVie and Lindsey Buckingham of the band Fleetwood Mac respond each time with \\"We love it\\". After the first chorus, the music temporarily shifts to a new section that removes the guitar and heavily emphasizes the synthesizer, before returning to its original melody. Newman proceeds to point out various objects and people, such as Matterhorn Bobsleds, palm trees, homeless people, and beautiful California women. Newman then name- drops several famous streets in Los Angeles: Century Boulevard, Victory Boulevard, Santa Monica Boulevard, and the Sixth Street Viaduct. Each time he says the name of a road, McVie and Buckingham respond with the phrase \\"We love it\\". A guitar solo follows, before the song ends with the chorus. =Lyrical analysis= Newman is well known for his sardonic lyrics, as he would often write a song from a character's perspective, and mock the first-person character and others like them. This style of songwriting can be seen in some of Newman's other songs, such as the slaver perspective in \\"Sail Away\\" (1972), and the redneck perspective in \\"Rednecks\\" (1974). Despite its lively sound, \\"I Love L.A.\\" also includes these sardonic lyrics, specifically about the shallow and dark aspects of Los Angeles. When Newman is listing off various sites in Los Angeles, Newman is discussing how residents will talk about the lavish excess of the city (palm trees, beautiful women) in an attempt to hide the squalor (a homeless man begging for money). Nicholas Pell of LA Weekly noted how there were other parts of the song that serve as subtle insults to the city. He noted the Santa Ana winds in reality are very unpleasant, as the strong winds blow palm leaves and furniture around, and often bring hot dry weather. Pell believes the four streets listed at the end of the song were the four \\"must avoid\\" streets of 1983, due to gang violence and urban neglect. Pell ultimately described \\"I Love L.A.\\" as a \\"paean to the moral weakness and intellectual vapidity\\" of Los Angeles. When journalist Timothy White asked whether or not \\"I Love L.A.\\" was written as an insult to Los Angeles, Newman responded by saying he felt the lyrics were ambiguous. In a separate interview, Newman confessed an affection for his native city despite its imperfections: \\"There's some kind of ignorance L.A. has that I'm proud of. The open car and the redhead, the Beach Boys... that sounds really good to me.\\" Release and reception \\"I Love L.A.\\" was released in 1983 as the lead single from Trouble in Paradise. At first, the single was considered a flop, as it failed to make the Billboard Hot 100, and was not distributed to retailers outside of the West Coast of the United States. The song did, however, reach #110 on Billboard Bubbling Under chart during April 1983.Joel Whitburn's Bubbling Under the Billboard Hot 100 1959-2004 The following year, Los Angeles hosted the Summer Olympics, and the company Nike ran an ambush marketing campaign during the event. The campaign included a commercial featuring Newman singing \\"I Love L.A.\\" while Olympic athletes Mary Decker and Carl Lewis ran and jumped wearing Nike gear. The commercial played throughout the Olympics, and as a result, \\"I Love L.A.\\" received worldwide exposure. It became one of the best selling songs in Los Angeles, as citizens of Los Angeles saw the song as a celebration of their city.

A modified version of the song was used as part of the \\"You'll Love It!\\" 1985‚Äì86 TV season image campaign for ABC. \\"I Love L.A.\\" is played following major sporting events in Los Angeles if the home team has scored or won, notably when the Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Rams and the Los Angeles Galaxy win, and when the Los Angeles Kings score a goal. The Dodgers adapted the title to \\"We Love L.A.\\" as a marketing slogan for the 2015 season, prompting Los Angeles Times writer Steve Dilbeck to quip, \\"It's not 'I Love L.A.' like in the song, but we love L.A. Guess they wanted to save paying royalties to Randy Newman.\\" In the 1985 movie Gotcha!, Anthony Edwards plays an American teenager, fugitive in Europe, who teaches \\"I Love L.A.\\" to a German punk rock band that smuggles him to safety. The song was one of many California related songs played throughout \\"Sunshine Plaza\\" in the original Disney California Adventure. In 2001, the XFL's Los Angeles Xtreme would play the song after they scored a touchdown, as well as when they won a home game. During the 2008 National League Division Series and 2008 National League Championship Series, TBS or Fox Network would play the song at the end of any half-inning where the Dodgers produced a run. It was also played over speakers when the Lakers arrived at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum following their 2009 NBA Championship parade and the winning of the second of their back-to-back titles when the Lakers beat the Celtics in Game 7. The sequence of streets in the song was parodied in the 1985 song \\"Born in East L.A.\\" by Cheech Marin. But instead of listing the streets sung by Randy Newman, listed are Soto Street, Brooklyn Avenue, City Terrace, and Whittier Boulevard, all streets of East Los Angeles. The song is referred to in the Bret Easton Ellis novel Less Than Zero, when the main character laments about the \\"bum on his knees\\" in a song about L.A. In June 2014, as part of losing a bet on the National Hockey League finals between the New York Rangers and the Los Angeles Kings with Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio sang the song on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, wearing an \\"I Love L.A.\\" T-shirt and accompanied by disadvantaged youth from the 52nd Street Project. For many years the \\"I Love L.A.\\" music video was played as the nightly sign- off for the Los Angeles PBS station, KCET. On October 11, 2020 the song was featured on Family Guy Season 19 Episode 3, titled Boys & Squirrels. The song was chosen by Chris and Stewie Griffin to play in the background of a video clip they took of their rescued squirrel taking its first steps, just before it's tragic death.

Hamilton. Plot introduction Burnt Offerings continues the adventures of Anita Blake, as she attempts to solve a series of arsons and other crimes, and deal with a threat to her lover, the vampire Jean-Claude, as he fends off a political challenge from the Vampire Council. As with the other later novels in the series, Burnt Offerings blends elements of supernatural, police procedural, and erotic fiction. Explanation of the title As with previous novels, \\"Burnt Offerings\\" refers to a location within the novel itself. In this case, \\"Burnt Offerings\\" is a vampire-themed theme restaurant where some of the events of the novel take place. (The fictional restaurant is itself named after the real-world 1976 haunted house movie, Burnt Offerings.) Plot summary As in the previous novels, Burnt Offerings requires Anita to balance her romantic life with her roles as supernatural police consultant, vampire executioner, zombie animator, human servant and lover to the vampire Master of the City and lupa to the local werewolf pack. In this case, Anita is quickly confronted with several problems that ultimately prove to be interrelated: * Fire Captain Pete McKinnon wants Anita's help with a series of arson incidents that he believes to be the work of a pyrokinetic. * The local wereleopard pard needs leadership and protection after Anita killed its \\"alpha,\\" Gabriel in the previous novel, The Killing Dance. * The Thronos Rokke pack of werewolves needs clear succession and protection, particularly while Richard is out of town studying for his master's degree. * A vampire has been set on fire at the vampire owned and themed restaurant, \\"Burnt Offerings.\\" The woman who did so claims that the vampire tried to bite her against her will, and alleges self-defense. This attack later proves to be the first in a series of attacks on vampires and vampire businesses. * Most threatening, the Vampire Council has sent representatives to Jean-Claude's territory in an attempt to investigate and possibly destroy Jean-Claude. The Council is threatened by Jean-Claude's ability to destroy one of its most powerful members, The Earthmover, and by Jean-Claude's refusal to take The Earthmover's place on the Council himself. (Jean-Claude will not do so because he is not strong enough to hold the position against challengers; but the Council, based in Europe, fears that Jean-Claude is setting up a rival council in the United States). The Council has sent representatives of four of its six remaining members, as follows:  Council member The Traveler has arrived personally, or at least in spirit (one of his powers is the ability to possess other vampires, and the location of his actual body is never revealed). The Traveler is accompanied by Balthasar, his human servant, and has also recruited one of Jean-Claude's vampires, Liv, to leave Jean-Claude's service and swear fealty to the Traveler.  Council member the Master of Beasts has arrived personally, accompanied by his son, Fernando and the other members of his triumvirate, Gideon and Captain Thomas Carswell.  Belle Morte does not come personally, but is represented by Asher, Jean-Claude's former lover and current mortal enemy.  Morte d'Amour is represented by the vampires Yvette and Warrick. Anita is forced to put the mysteries aside as she participates in a series of confrontations between Jean-Claude's followers and the council. Ultimately, Anita's combination of loyalty, ruthlessness, and naivet√© allows her to triumph over each of the delegations of vampires. * The Master of Beasts and Fernando attempt to seize control of as many of the city's lycanthropes as possible, but are ultimately stopped by Anita, Richard and Rafael. Anita assumes control of the leopard pard and fully assumes her role as lupa, rescuing all of the local shapeshifters with Richard and Jean-Claude's help, but not before the Master of Beasts, Fernando, and Liv torture Rafael and Fernando and Liv torture and rape Sylvie and Vivian. * Anita shares Jean-Claude's love for Asher, notwithstanding Asher's scars and his hatred of them both. Ultimately, their love wins Asher over, and he decides to leave Belle Morte's service and remain in St. Louis with Anita and Jean-Claude. * Anita offers friendship to the Traveler, and challenges him to be a worthy ruler when she discovers that his power is causing local vampires to become feral. Intrigued, he accepts. * As she and Richard confront the Master of Beasts a second time, the Master lets Anita get too close. Anita draws on the power of Raina's munin, using Raina's powers to threaten harm rather than healing. With the Master's heart in her metaphysical grip, Anita threatens to kill him unless the Master leaves St. Louis and turns over Liv and Fernando to suffer the punishment for raping a member of Anita's werewolf pack. The Master is loath to give up his son, but ultimately agrees, and Anita turns Liv and Fernando over to Sylvie and the pack, winning their loyalty as their lupa. * Yvette then reveals her plan, solving the remaining mysteries. Like Mister Oliver before him, Yvette's master, Morte d'Amour, fears the US experiment with vampire legalization and wishes to sabotage it. Yvette, together with Harry, the owner of Burnt Offerings, has been provoking Humans First to attack vampires and vampire businesses, and plans for Asher to kill Jean-Claude, seize control of the city's vampires, and provoke them into a murderous rampage. Asher, won over by Jean-Claude and Anita, refuses. Yvette then reveals her back-up plan‚Äîat her instructions, Warrick, a pyrokinetic, has been setting the arson fires, and will burn down a stadium full of people. Warrick, a former crusader, announces that he has rediscovered his faith in God and refuses to assist Yvette. Yvette then announces that she personally will go on a rampage, but is stopped by Warrick, who uses his powers to burn both Yvette and himself to ash. Characters in Burnt Offerings =Major characters= Burnt Offerings features the following major characters. * Anita Blake: Anita becomes even more deeply enmeshed in the supernatural world, as she accepts the role of Nimir-Ra of the St. Louis pard and becomes deeper enmeshed in her roles as Jean-Claude's human servant and the lupa of the Thronos Rokke clan of werewolves. Meanwhile, her romantic life grows more complicated as she and Richard enchange power and continue to argue over their relationship. Finally, Anita develops or explores three new powers - her control over the vampires she has raised (Damian and Willie), her ability to cause harm from a distance with a slashing attack similar to some vampires, and her ability to call Raina's munin to heal or harm. * Jean-Claude: Burnt Offerings continues an ongoing plotline as Jean-Claude struggles to assert control over his newly acquired territory and to assert independence in the larger vampire world. Meanwhile, Jean-Claude maneuvers Anita into admitting their romantic relationship publicly, and begins a reconciliation with Asher. * Richard: Richard continues his downward spiral after Anita's rejection in the previous novel, The Killing Dance. Anita learns that Richard is unable to accept his werewolf nature, making him vulnerable to challenge and interfering with his ability to lead and protect the pack. Unable to repair Richard, Anita attempts to contain the damage by preventing anyone from challenging Richard, and by defending the pack herself. =Other characters= Recurring characters in Burnt Offerings include: * Anita's friends and coworkers Larry and Ronnie. * Police officers Dolph, Zerbrowski, Clive Perry, and Tammy Reynolds. Burnt Offerings shows Dolph's mistrust of Anita increasing as she continues to date Jean-Claude, and introduces Tammy, RPIT's first witch officer; * Werewolves Irving, Jason, Jamil, Stephen, Sylvie and Teddy; * Wereleopards Cherry, Elizabeth, Nathaniel, Vivian, and Zane; * Wererats Lillian and Rafael; * Vampires Asher (Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter), Damian, Liv, and Willie; and * Jean-Claude's human flunky Ernie. Non-recurring characters include: * Gwen: Sylvie Barker's girlfriend, a psychiatrist and a powerful werewolf, with long wavy blond hair and a dainty, \\"china doll\\" appearance. * Hannah: One of Jean- Claude's vampires. Hannah is also dating Willie McCoy. * Captain Pete McKinnon: A fire captain who Dolph refers to Anita for help with a series of pyrokinetic arson crimes. * Vampire Council members The Traveler and The Master of Beasts. * Vampire Council retainers Balthasar, Gideon, and Captain Thomas Carswell. * Non-dominant werewolves Kevin and Lorraine, who Anita forces to protect Stephen and Nathaniel along with non-recurring character Teddy. The death toll in Burnt Offerings includes: * An unnamed assassin from Humans First, shot by Anita and Ronnie; * Yvette and Warrick, burned to death by Warrick's pyrokinesis; * Fernando and Liv, presumably tortured to death by Sylvie; * Harry, a centuries-old vampire with brown hair, owner of \\"Burnt Offerings,\\" a vampire-themed theme restaurant. Harry was part of Morte d'Amour's bloodline, and cooperated with Yvette in her scheme to force a vampire-human war. Presumably, he was killed by Jean-Claude's vampires after the events of the novel.

Reichelt had become fixated on developing a suit for aviators that would convert into a parachute and allow them to survive a fall should they be forced to leave their aircraft in mid- air. Initial experiments conducted with dummies dropped from the fifth floor of his apartment building had been successful, but he was unable to replicate those early successes with any of his subsequent designs. Believing that a suitably high test platform would prove his invention's efficacy, Reichelt repeatedly petitioned the Parisian Prefecture of Police for permission to conduct a test from the Eiffel Tower. He finally received permission in 1912, but when he arrived at the tower on 4February he made it clear that he intended to jump personally rather than conduct an experiment with dummies. Despite attempts to dissuade him, he jumped from the first platform of the tower wearing his invention. The parachute failed to deploy and he plummeted to his death. The next day, newspapers were full of illustrated stories about the death of the \\"reckless inventor\\", and the jump was shown in newsreels.  Early life  Reichelt was born in Wegst√§dtl, in the Kingdom of Bohemia, part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (today, ≈†tƒõt√≠, Czech Republic) in 1878 and moved to Paris in 1898. He obtained French nationality in 1909, adopting the first name Fran√ßois (the French equivalent of the Germanic \\"Franz\\"). One of his sisters may have also come to France and been married to a jeweller there, but newspaper reports differed on the details of his family life, with most reporting that his sisters stayed in Vienna. Reichelt himself was unmarried. He took an apartment on the third floor at 8 rue Gaillon near the Avenue de l'Opera from 1907 (which he rented for 1500 francs a year) and opened what was to become a successful dressmaking business, catering mostly to Austrians on trips to Paris.  Experiments  From July 1910, Reichelt began to develop a \\"parachute-suit\\": a suit that was not much more bulky than one normally worn by an aviator, but with the addition of a few rods, a silk canopy and a small amount of rubber that allowed it to fold out to become what Reichelt hoped would be a practical and efficient parachute. Illustration of the first parachute jump by alt=A man leaping from a tower. The dawn of the aviation age brought inevitable accidents coupled with a growing interest in safety measures, most notably in the development of an effective parachute. Early parachuting successes, such as those of Louis-S√©bastien Lenormand (in 1783), and balloonist Jean-Pierre Blanchard had successfully used fixed-canopy parachutes (already \\"open\\" before the jump began), and Andr√©-Jacques Garnerin had invented a frameless parachute suitable for use from high altitudes, but by 1910 there was still no parachute suitable for use in jumping from a plane or at low altitude. Reichelt seems to have become interested in parachute design after hearing some of the stories of fatal accidents among the early aeronauts and aviators. His early test were successful: dummies equipped with foldable silk \\"wings\\" touched down lightly when dropped from the fifth floor, but converting the prototypes into a wearable \\"suit\\" proved difficult. His original design used of material and weighed around . He presented his design to the leading aeronautic organization, La Ligue A√©rienne at the A√©ro-Club de France, hoping that they would test it, but they rejected his designs on the grounds that the construction of the canopy was too weak, and they attempted to dissuade him from spending further time on development. Reichelt nevertheless persevered and conducted experimental drops with dummies from the courtyard of his building at rue Gaillon. None of his tests proved successful. In 1911, a Colonel Lalance wrote to the A√©ro-Club de France, offering a prize of 10,000 francs for a safety parachute for aviatorsdouble the prize he had offered the year before. The competition was open for three years and stipulated that the parachute must weigh no more than . Reichelt refined his design, reducing the weight while increasing the surface area of the material until it reached . But his tests were still unsuccessful and his dummies invariably fell heavily to earth. L'Ouest-√âclair reported that in 1911 he had personally jumped from a height of at Joinville; the attempt failed but a pile of straw helped him escape injury. Le Matin reported an attempt at Nogent from a height of that resulted in a broken leg. Le Petit Journal suggested that he also made at least two apparently inconclusive tests with dummies from the first deck of the Eiffel Tower during 1911, but an interview with one of Reichelt's friends in La Presse made it clear that he had been unsuccessfully applying for permission to conduct a test from the Eiffel Tower for over a year before he finally received the authorization for the final jump. There had been other tests from the tower during 1910 and 1911 though; Gaston Hervieu, who employed a dummy aircraft and mannequins in his experiments, was attempting to perfect a parachute design to ensure the safe landing of a pilot with all or part of a damaged aircraft. Reichelt attributed the failures of his designs at least in part to the short drop distances over which he had conducted his tests, so he was keen to receive permission to experiment from the Eiffel Tower. Eiffel Tower jump Reichelt showed off the suit at the foot of the Eiffel Tower shortly before his fatal fall. Reichelt announced to the press in early February 1912 that he had finally received permission and would shortly conduct an experiment from the Eiffel Tower to prove the value of his invention. On Sunday, 4 February, at 7:00 a.m., he arrived at the tower by car with two friends. He was already wearing his parachute suit. The news footage of his jump shows him modelling his invention in its folded form, which Le Gaulois described as \\"... only a little more voluminous than ordinary clothing ...\\" (\\"\\"). The suit did not restrict the wearer's movements when the parachute was packed, and Le Petit Parisien described the method of deploying the parachute as being as simple as extending the arms out to form a cross with the body. Once extended, the outfit resembled \\"a sort of cloak fitted with a vast hood of silk\\" (\\"\\") according to Le Temps. L'Action Fran√ßaise reported that Reichelt stated the surface area of the final design to be with a canopy height of , while Le Figaro judged the surface area might have reached . La Croix claimed that the suit may have weighed as little as . The weather was cold, with temperatures below ,L'Action Fran√ßaise recorded the temperature as at 7 am. and there was a stiff breeze blowing across the Champ de Mars. There were some police officers present to maintain order, as the Parisian Prefecture of Police had given Reichelt permission to proceed. After Reichelt's death, Louis L√©pine who, as the Prefect of Police (), was ultimately responsible for the permission being granted, issued a statement making it clear that while the police routinely gave permission for experiments to be performed from the Eiffel Tower, it was understood in these cases that dummies would be used. They had given permission in Reichelt's case only on the basis that he would be conducting dummy drops, and that under no circumstances would they have allowed him to proceed if they had known he would be making the jump himself. L√©pine assured La Croix that he had never signed an order that allowed a live jump. From his arrival at the tower, however, Reichelt made it clear that he intended to jump himself. According to a later interview with one of the friends who accompanied him up the tower, this was a surprise to everybody, as Reichelt had concealed his intention until the last moment. His friends tried to persuade him to use dummies in the experiment, assuring him that he would have other opportunities to make the jump himself. When this failed to make an impression on him, they pointed to the strength of the wind and said he should call off the test on safety grounds, or at least delay until the wind dropped. They were unable to shake his resolve; seemingly undeterred by the failure of his previous tests, he told journalists from Le Petit Journal that he was totally convinced that his apparatus would work, and work well. When questioned as to whether he planned to take any additional precautions, such as using a safety rope, he replied that he would not, since he intended to trust his life entirely to his parachute: Hervieu, who was present to witness the demonstration, also attempted to dissuade him from making the jump. He was concerned that the parachute needed longer to fully open than the few seconds the drop from the first platform would allow, and he also presented other technical objections to which Reichelt could not provide a satisfactory response. Reichelt finally replied that: alt=A video of the jump Ropes had been suspended between the legs of the tower by the police at Reichelt's request to prevent the crowds from spilling onto the landing zone, and he spent some time discussing the arrangements with the marshals and ensuring that there was sufficient space for his landing before going to the stairs to climb to the first platform. According to Le Petit Parisien, Reichelt's initial attempt to ascend to the first stage of the tower was blocked by a guard named Gassion, who had witnessed previous unsuccessful dummy drops and feared that Reichelt's attempt would end in disaster, though Le Figaro reported that he had merely not received a copy of the order and had to wait for telephone confirmation from his superiors. Despite the guard's resistance, by 8:00 a.m. the matter had been resolved: Reichelt, who was visibly shaken by his argument with the guard, was allowed to mount the tower with his two friends and a cinematographer (another was stationed near the foot of the tower to record the jump from below). As he climbed the stairs he paused, turned back to the crowd, raised his hand and wished them a cheery \\"\\". (See you soon). His friends continued to try to talk him out of the jump, but Reichelt was quite determined. At 8:22 a.m., observed by a crowd of about 30 journalists and curious onlookers, he readied himself ‚Äì facing towards the Seine ‚Äì on a stool placed on a restaurant table next to the interior guardrail of the tower's first deck, a little more than above the ground. After adjusting his apparatus with the assistance of his friends and checking the wind direction by throwing a piece of paper taken from a small book, he placed one foot on the guardrail, hesitated for about 40 seconds, then leapt outwards. According to Le Figaro, he was calm and smiling just before he jumped. His parachute, which had seemed to be only half-open, folded around him almost immediately and he fell for a few seconds before striking the frozen soil at the foot of the tower. Le Petit Parisien reported that his right leg and arm were crushed, his skull and spine broken, and that he was bleeding from his mouth, nose and ears. Le Figaro noted that his eyes were wide open and dilated. He was already dead by the time the onlookers rushed to his body, but he was taken to the Necker hospital where he was officially pronounced dead, and then on to a police station in the rue Amelie before being returned to his home in rue Gaillon.√âdouard Launet, writing in the Summer supplement of Lib√©ration in 2009, mentioned that an autopsy concluded that Reichelt had died of a heart attack during his fall. Aftermath alt= Louis L√©pine The next day's newspapers were full of the story of Reichelt's \\"tragic experiment\\" (\\"\\") complete with photographs; at least four newspapers, Le Petit Parisien, L'Humanit√©, Le Matin and La Croix,The Catholic newspaper La Croix did not publish a Monday edition, but reported the story on the front page of the Tuesday edition. showed images of the fatal jump. Film of the attempt, including footage of Reichelt's body being removed and the onlookers measuring the depth of the hole created by his impact (15 centimetres; 5.9 in), was distributed by news organizations. Initial reports speculated on Reichelt's state of mind: none assumed he had been suicidal, but many called him reckless or foolish. A journalist in Le Gaulois suggested that only half the term \\"mad genius\\" applied to Reichelt ‚Äì although the same report included an interview with one of Reichelt's friends, who claimed that the tailor had felt pressured into giving a dramatic demonstration to attract sponsors, without whom he could not expect to make a profit before any patent expired. Reichelt's death was the first to result from a parachuting accident since Charles Leroux died giving a demonstration in Tallinn in 1889. In fact, on 2 February 1912 ‚Äì two days prior to Reichelt's fatal jump ‚Äì an American steeplejack, Frederick R. Law, had successfully parachuted from the viewing platform of the torch of the Statue of Liberty ( above sea level and from the base of the statue), seemingly on a whim. On 6 February, La Croix added a footnote to the report on Reichelt's death: another parachuting experiment was to take place on 18 or 25 February at Juvisy-sur- Orge, in which the aviator Camille Guillaume planned to leap from his Bl√©riot monoplane at a height of to test a parachute design (the plane would be allowed to crash). alt=Newspaper photo montage After Reichelt's death, the authorities were wary of granting permission for experiments from the Eiffel Tower. Though they continued to grant permissions for parachute dummy drops, some hopeful inventors ‚Äì such as a man named Damblanc, who wished to try his \\"helicopter parachute\\" from the second platform ‚Äì were refused permission to conduct tests, and even applications for aviation experiments not involving the tower came under renewed scrutiny. More recently, the tower has been the scene of a number of illicit base jumps. A Norwegian man died in 2005 after losing his canopy while attempting a promotional jump for a clothing firm ‚Äì the first parachuting death at the tower since Reichelt. A sanctioned stunt jump for the 1985 James Bond film A View to a Kill was successful.According to the DVD featurette \\"Inside A View to a Kill\\", an unsanctioned jump from the Tower was also undertaken by two crewmembers prior to the filming of the scene Reichelt came momentarily to prominence again in the 1940s in the United States, when his likeness was claimed as the model for one of the figures that were \\"strangely un-American in expression and garb\\" in the WPA-funded mural at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn.Gordon p. 99 In an incident reminiscent of the 1933 controversy over Diego Rivera's Man at the Crossroads mural at the Rockefeller Center in New York City, a furore erupted over an image depicting two minor leftist aviators, supposedly flanking a central portrait of Joseph Stalin. The WPA already had an unwanted reputation as sympathetic to the left, and despite the artist August Henkel's \\"glib\\" explanation of the \\"accidental\\" inclusion of a Soviet red star and his claim that the image identified as Stalin was actually of Reichelt, the murals were taken down and three of the four panels burned. The story of Reichelt's misadventure was also the subject of a 1993 French short, , written and directed by Pablo Lopez Paredes and starring Bruce Myers in the title role. Although there were no viable parachuting solutions for use in aeroplanes when Reichelt began developing his suit, a patent for a packable parachute had been applied for by Gleb Kotelnikov.Kotelnikov was granted a patent in France in March 1912.

It has been in operation since 1936, originally being named M. P. Weibel and having worked as an electronics business throughout the firm's existence. Since the 1970s, the company has focused on becoming a specialised in the field of radar. Having developed an international presence over its decades of existence, Weibel Scientific‚Äôs products have been used by a diverse range of operators and for numerous purposes, including the tracking of space vehicles by NASA, as well as the detection of unmanned aerial vehicles and the guidance component of ground-based air defense systems for various nations' militaries. History Weibel Scientific can trace its origins back to the establishment of Danish electronics company M. P. Weibel in 1936. It was originally named after its founder, Marius Peter Weibel, and has been a technology-orientated firm even in its early years. 1977 was a year of significant change for Weibel, as the Weibel family decided to divest themselves of involvement in the business; the firm's general manager, Erik Tingleff Larsen, established the firm as Weibel Scientific during this same year. During the late 1970s and 1980s, Weibel Scientific progressively wound down its previous primary business activity of manufacturing optical detectors, opting to focus its resources on the development of radar systems. In response to international demands for the company's product, management decided to expand the firm beyond Denmark's borders. Accordingly, in 1989, a new German subsidiary, Weibel GmbH, was established; during 1993, the US-based Weibel Equipment Inc. was founded to explore business opportunities in the North American market. During 2002, Erik Tingleff Larsen stepped back from Weibel Scientific‚Äôs day- to-day management, Peder R. Pedersen having become the firm's CEO and President. Larsen has been the firm's sole shareholder, as well as the chairman of the board, for many years. In terms of its corporate structure, Weibel Scientific is organised as a privately-owned, independently-operated corporation. For decades, the company has marketed its products for purposes such as missile defense systems, and has sold thousands of radar units in the United States alone. The American space organisation NASA has been a long term customer of Weibel, the firm's radar systems have been used to detect debris coming off the Space Shuttle during its launch phase. During summer 2015, it was announced that Weibel Scientific has entered into a long term partnership with American defence conglomerate Lockheed Martin. This stated aim of this partnership is to integrate Weibel‚Äôs radar technology with Lockheed Martin‚Äôs missile defense systems, and to act as a major supplier of missile defense packages throughout the North American and European markets. During December 2017, through this partnership, Weibel Scientific received its largest contract to date from the United States Army; this deal has Lockheed Martin acting as the prime contractor for the production and delivery of three Multi- Frequency Tracking Radars. In January 2019, Weibel Scientific established an office in Norway to facilitate its strategic move towards the drone detection and ground-based air defense markets. During September 2019, the firm secured a contract to supply a phased-array tracking radar to the And√∏ya Space Center, Norway. In November 2019, it was announced that Norwegian defense and technology company Kongsberg Gruppen had signed a major contract with Weibel Scientific to provide their radar systems for the Norwegian Army new mobile ground-based air defense system; Pedersen stated that it was \\"one of the most strategically important contracts we have won in our entire history\\". Activities Weibel Scientific‚Äôs headquarters is located in Aller√∏d, Denmark. Just over 170 people have been typically employed at the headquarters. All of Weibel's radars operate in the X band and function as continuous wave doppler radars. The firm designs and produces several classes of radars, including: * Muzzle velocity radars or Velocimeters for artillery and guns * Fixed head Doppler radars (SL-xxxx series) * Tracking radars (MSL- xxxx series) * Ranging radars for Optical Platforms * Multi-Frequency Long Range Tracking radars (MFTR-xxxx series) References External links * Weibel company website Category:Electronics companies of Denmark Category:Defense companies of Denmark Category:Aerospace companies of Denmark Category:Companies based in Aller√∏d Municipality Category:Technology companies based in Copenhagen Category:Danish companies established in 1997 ","title":"Weibel Scientific"},{"id":"5065658","text":"The Cetinje Octoechos ( or Cetinjski oktoih) is an Orthodox liturgical book printed in 1494 in Cetinje, the capital of the Principality of Zeta (present- day Montenegro).

Printed in two instalments, its first volume contains the hymns to be sung to the first four tones of the Octoechos system of musical modes, and the hymns for the remaining four tones are included in the second volume. The two volumes are called Octoechos of the First Tone (Oktoih prvoglasnik) and Octoechos of the Fifth Tone (Oktoih petoglasnik), respectively. Octoechos of the First Tone Octoechos of the First Tone (Oktoih prvoglasnik) was finished on 4 January 1494. There are 108 copies of this book which survived. It contains 270 leaves sized 29 x 21.6 cm. It is characterized by high quality and clean two-coloured printing, red and black, with finely formed letters. It is decorated with headpieces and initials printed from woodcuts in the spirit of the Renaissance with traces of old manuscript traditions. In the quality of its print and decoration it is considered to be at the same level as Venetian production at that time. The National Library of Montenegro \\"Djurdje Crnojevic\\" in Cetinje published 600 facsimiles of Octoechos of the First Tone in 1987. Octoechos of the Fifth Tone Cetinje Octoechos of the Fifth Tone (modern reprint) Octoechos of the Fifth Tone (Oktoih petoglasnik) represents the first illustrated South Slavic incunabulum. It is preserved in fragments, the longest one containing 37 leaves. It has six woodcut illustrations, made by an artist who managed to put rather complex compositions with many characters on a relatively small space.

Its apparent magnitude varies from about 3.4 to 4.1, making it readily visible to the naked eye and one of the brightest members of Carina. Based upon parallax measurements, it is approximately from Earth. From the characteristics of its spectrum, l Carinae has a stellar classification of G5 Iab/Ib. This indicates the star has reached a stage in its evolution where it has expanded to become a supergiant with 169 times the radius of the Sun. As this is a massive star with 8‚Äì13 times the mass of the Sun, it rapidly burns through its supply of nuclear fuel and has become a supergiant in roughly , after spending as a main sequence star. l Carinae is classified as a Cepheid variable star and its brightness varies over an amplitude range of 0.725 in magnitude with a long period of 35.560 days. The radial velocity of the star likewise varies by 39 km/s during each pulsation cycle. Its radius varies by about as it pulsates, reaching maximum size as its brightness is decreasing towards minimum. It has a compact circumstellar envelope that can be discerned using interferometry. The envelope has been resolved at an infrared wavelength of 10Œºm, showing a radius of 10‚Äì100 AU at a mean temperature of 100 K. The material for this envelope was supplied by mass ejected from the central star. The period of l Carinae is calculated to be slowly increasing and it is thought to be crossing the instability strip for the third time, cooling as it evolves towards a red supergiant after a blue loop.

Stene Distinguished Professor of Public Administration at the University of Kansas. He was President Emeritus of Eastern Washington University until 1987 and served as President of the American Society for Public Administration] (ASPA). Frederickson was the founding editor of the Journal of Public Affairs Education (JPAE) and was founder and Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory (JPART). Major influences on public administration =Minnowbrook II= * Frederickson is responsible for coordinating the second Minnowbrook Conference, Minnowbrook II, held in 1988. The conference was held at Syracuse University's conference center in the Adirondack Mountains. Lasting a total of four days, Minnowbrook II gave Frederickson and his colleagues the chance to reexamine the impacts of Minnowbrook I on the field of Public Administration. =Social equity= * In 1968 Frederickson came up with \\"a theory of social equity and put it forward as the \\"third pillar\\" of public administration.\\" Frederickson was concerned that those in public administration were making the mistake of assuming that citizen A is the same as citizen B; ignoring social and economic conditions. His goal is: for social equity to take on the same \\"status as economy and efficiency as values or principles to which public administration should adhere.\\" =Moral justification for bureaucracy= * In 2002 Frederickson published an article for Administration & Society, titled, Confucius and the Moral Basis of Bureaucracy.

The SN2-like methyl transfer reaction. Only the SAM cofactor and cytosine base are shown for simplicity. Methyltransferases are a large group of enzymes that all methylate their substrates but can be split into several subclasses based on their structural features. The most common class of methyltransferases is class I, all of which contain a Rossmann fold for binding S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM). Class II methyltransferases contain a SET domain, which are exemplified by SET domain histone methyltransferases, and class III methyltransferases, which are membrane associated. Methyltransferases can also be grouped as different types utilizing different substrates in methyl transfer reactions. These types include protein methyltransferases, DNA/RNA methyltransferases, natural product methyltransferases, and non-SAM dependent methyltransferases. SAM is the classical methyl donor for methyltrasferases, however, examples of other methyl donors are seen in nature. The general mechanism for methyl transfer is a SN2-like nucleophilic attack where the methionine sulfur serves as the nucleophile that transfers the methyl group to the enzyme substrate. SAM is converted to S-Adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) during this process. The breaking of the SAM-methyl bond and the formation of the substrate-methyl bond happen nearly simultaneously. These enzymatic reactions are found in many pathways and are implicated in genetic diseases, cancer, and metabolic diseases. Another type of methyl transfer is the radical S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) which is the methylation of unactivated carbon atoms in primary metabolites, proteins, lipids, and RNA. Function =Genetics= Methylation, as well as other epigenetic modifications, affects transcription, gene stability, and parental imprinting. It directly impacts chromatin structure and can modulate gene transcription, or even completely silence or activate genes, without mutation to the gene itself. Though the mechanisms of this genetic control are complex, hypo- and hypermethylation of DNA is implicated in many diseases. =Protein regulation= Methylation of proteins has a regulatory role in protein‚Äìprotein interactions, protein‚ÄìDNA interactions, and protein activation. Examples: RCC1, an important mitotic protein, is methylated so that it can interact with centromeres of chromosomes. This is an example of regulation of protein-protein interaction, as methylation regulates the attachment of RCC1 to histone proteins H2A and H2B. The RCC1-chromatin interaction is also an example of a protein-DNA interaction, as another domain of RCC1 interacts directly with DNA when this protein is methylated. When RCC1 is not methylated, dividing cells have multiple spindle poles and usually cannot survive. p53 methylated on lysine to regulate its activation and interaction with other proteins in the DNA damage response. This is an example of regulation of protein-protein interactions and protein activation. p53 is a known tumor suppressor that activates DNA repair pathways, initiates apoptosis, and pauses the cell cycle. Overall, it responds to mutations in DNA, signaling to the cell to fix them or to initiate cell death so that these mutations cannot contribute to cancer. NF-Œ∫B (a protein involved in inflammation) is a known methylation target of the methyltransferase SETD6, which turns off NF-Œ∫B signaling by inhibiting of one of its subunits, RelA. This reduces the transcriptional activation and inflammatory response, making methylation of NF-Œ∫B a regulatory process by which cell signaling through this pathway is reduced. Natural product methyltransferases provide a variety of inputs into metabolic pathways, including the availability of cofactors, signalling molecules, and metabolites. This regulates various cellular pathways by controlling protein activity. Types =Histone methyltransferases= General scheme of the reaction catalyzed by a lysine histone methyltransferase Histone methyltransferases are critical for genetic regulation at the epigenetic level. They modify mainly lysine on the Œµ-nitrogen and the arginine guanidinium group on histone tails. Lysine methyltransferases and Arginine methyltransferases are unique classes of enzymes, but both bind SAM as a methyl donor for their histone substrates. Lysine amino acids can be modified with one, two, or three methyl groups, while Arginine amino acids can be modified with one or two methyl groups. This increases the strength of the positive charge and residue hydrophobicity, allowing other proteins to recognize methyl marks. The effect of this modification depends on the location of the modification on the histone tail and the other histone modifications around it. The location of the modifications can be partially determined by DNA sequence, as well as small non-coding RNAs and the methylation of the DNA itself. Most commonly, it is histone H3 or H4 that is methylated in vertebrates. Either increased or decreased transcription of genes around the modification can occur. Increased transcription is a result of decreased chromatin condensation, while decreased transcription results from increased chromatin condensation. Methyl marks on the histones contribute to these changes by serving as sites for recruitment of other proteins that can further modify chromatin. =N-terminal methyltransferases= Representative scheme of reaction catalyzed by N-alpha methyltransferases, with representative substrate. The N-terminal residue that is modified is Serine. N-alpha methyltransferases transfer a methyl group from SAM to the N-terminal nitrogen on protein targets. The N-terminal methionine is first cleaved by another enzyme and the X-Proline-Lysine consensus sequence is recognized by the methyltransferase. For all known substrates, the X amino acid is Alanine, Serine, or Proline. This reaction yields a methylated protein and SAH. Known targets of these methyltransferases in humans include RCC-1 (a regulator of nuclear transport proteins) and Retinoblastoma protein (a tumor suppressor protein that inhibits excessive cell division). RCC-1 methylation is especially important in mitosis as it coordinates the localization of some nuclear proteins in the absence of the nuclear envelope. When RCC-1 is not methylated, cell division is abnormal following the formation of extra spindle poles. The function of Retinoblastoma protein N-terminal methylation is not known. =DNA/RNA methyltransferases= 5'-methylcytosine molecule with methyl group, added by a DNA methyltransferase, highlighted in red DNA methylation, a key component of genetic regulation, occurs primarily at the 5-carbon of the base cytosine, forming 5‚Äômethylcytosine (see left). Methylation is an epigenetic modification catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase enzymes, including DNMT1, DNMT2, and DNMT3. These enzymes use S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl donor and contain several highly conserved structural features between the three forms; these include the S-adenosylmethionine binding site, a vicinal proline-cysteine pair which forms a thiolate anion important for the reaction mechanism, and the cytosine substrate binding pocket. Many features of DNA methyltransferases are highly conserved throughout many classes of life, from bacteria to mammals. In addition to controlling the expression of certain genes, there are a variety of protein complexes, many with implications for human health, which only bind to methylated DNA recognition sites. Many of the early DNA methyltransferases have been thought to be derived from RNA methyltransferases that were supposed to be active in the RNA world to protect many species of primitive RNA. RNA methylation has been observed in different types of RNA species viz.mRNA, rRNA, tRNA, snoRNA, snRNA, miRNA, tmRNA as well as viral RNA species. Specific RNA methyltransferases are employed by cells to mark these on the RNA species according to the need and environment prevailing around the cells, which form a part of field called molecular epigenetics. 2'-O-methylation, m6A methylation, m1G methylation as well as m5C are most commonly methylation marks observed in different types of RNA. 6A is an enzyme that catalyzes chemical reaction as following: S-adenosyl-L-methionine + DNA adenine S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + DNA 6-methylaminopurine m6A was primarily found in prokaryotes until 2015 when it was also identified in some eukaryotes. m6A methyltransferases methylate the amino group in DNA at C-6 position specifically to prevent the host system to digest own genome through restriction enzymes. m5C plays a role to regulate gene transcription. m5C transferases are the enzymes that produce C5-methylcytosine in DNA at C-5 position of cytosine and are found in most plants and some eukaryotes. =Natural product methyltransferases= The reaction converting norepinephrine to epinephrine, catalyzed by PNMT. Natural product methyltransferases (NPMTs) are a diverse group of enzymes that add methyl groups to naturally-produced small molecules. Like many methyltransferases, SAM is utilized as a methyl donor and SAH is produced. Methyl groups are added to S, N, O, or C atoms, and are classified by which of these atoms are modified, with O-methyltransferases representing the largest class. The methylated products of these reactions serve a variety of functions, including co-factors, pigments, signalling compounds, and metabolites. NPMTs can serve a regulatory role by modifying the reactivity and availability of these compounds. These enzymes are not highly conserved across different species, as they serve a more specific function in providing small molecules for specialized pathways in species or smaller groups of species. Reflective of this diversity is the variety of catalytic strategies, including general acid- base catalysis, metal-based catalysis, and proximity and desolvation effects not requiring catalytic amino acids. NPMTs are the most functionally diverse class of methyltransferases. SAM donates a methyl group through a radical mechanism in production of caffeine (R1 = R2 = R3 = CH3), theobromine (alkaloid in chocolate) (R1 = H, R2 = R3 = CH3) and theophylline (R1 = R2 = CH3, R3 = H). Important examples of this enzyme class in humans include phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), which converts norepinephrine to epinephrine, and histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT), which methylates histamine in the process of histamine metabolism. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) degrades a class of molecules known as catcholamines that includes dopamine, epinephrine, and norepenepherine. =Non-SAM dependent methyltransferases= Methanol, methyl tetrahydrofolate, mono-, di-, and trimethylamine, methanethiol, methyltetrahydromethanopterin, and chloromethane are all methyl donors found in biology as methyl group donors, typically in enzymatic reactions using the cofactor vitamin B12.Ragsdale, S.W. \\"Catalysis of methyl group transfers involving tetrahydrofolate and B12\\" Vitamins and Hormones, 2008. These substrates contribute to methyl transfer pathways including methionine biosynthesis, methanogenesis, and acetogenesis. = Radical SAM methyltransferases = Based on different protein structures and mechanisms of catalysis, there are 3 different types of radical SAM (RS) methylases: Class A, B, and C. Class A RS methylases are the best characterized of the 4 enzymes and are related to both RlmN and Cfr. RlmN is ubiquitous in bacteria which enhances translational fidelity and RlmN catalyzes methylation of C2 of adenosine 2503 (A2503) in 23 S rRNA and C2 of adenosine (A37). Cfr, on the other hand, catalyzes methylation of C8 of A2503 as well and it also catalyzes C2 methylation. Class B is currently the largest class of radical SAM methylases which can mathylate both sp2-hybridized and sp3-hybridized carbon atoms in different sets of substrates unlike Class A which only catalyzes sp2-hybridized carbon atoms. The main difference that distinguishes Class B from others is the additional N-terminal cobalamin- binding domain that binds to the RS domain. Class C methylase has homologous sequence with the RS enzyme, coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (HemN), which also catalyzes the methylation of sp2-hybridized carbon centers yet it lacks the 2 cysteines required for methylation in mechanism of Class A.biological methyl donors with relevant methyl group highlighted in red  Clinical significance  As with any biological process which regulates gene expression and/or function, anomalous DNA methylation is associated with genetic disorders such as ICF, Rett syndrome, and Fragile X syndrome. Cancer cells typically exhibit less DNA methylation activity in general, though often hypermethylation at sites which are unmethylated in normal cells; this overmethylation often functions as a way to inactivate tumor-suppressor genes. Inhibition of overall DNA methyltransferase activity has been proposed as a treatment option, but DNMT inhibitors, analogs of their cytosine substrates, have been found to be highly toxic due to their similarity to cytosine (see right); this similarity to the nucleotide causes the inhibitor to be incorporated into DNA translation, causing non-functioning DNA to be synthesized. A methylase which alters the ribosomal RNA binding site of the antibiotic linezolid causes cross-resistance to other antibiotics that act on the ribosomal RNA. Plasmid vectors capable of transmitting this gene are a cause of potentially dangerous cross resistance. Examples of methyltransferase enzymes relevant to disease: *thiopurine methyltransferase: defects in this gene causes toxic accumulation of thiopurine compounds, drugs used in chemotherapy and immunosuppressant therapy *methionine synthase: pernicious anemia, caused by Vitamin B12 deficiency, is caused by a lack of cofactor for the methionine synthase enzyme  Applications in drug discovery and development  Recent work has revealed the methyltransferases involved in methylation of naturally occurring anticancer agents to use S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) analogs that carry alternative alkyl groups as a replacement for methyl. The development of the facile chemoenzymatic platform to generate and utilize differentially alkylated SAM analogs in the context of drug discovery and drug development is known as alkylrandomization.  Applications in cancer treatment  In human cells, it was found that m5C was associated with abnormal tumor cells in cancer. The role and potential application of m5C includes to balance the impaired DNA in cancer both hypermethylation and hypomethylation.

Trained by Bob Baffert and ridden by Gary Stevens, he is best known for winning the 1997 Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes in the Triple Crown. He also won the Dubai World Cup (of which he is the oldest surviving winner), and stood at stud in both America and Japan. Upon the death of Hansel, Silver Charm became the oldest living winner of the Preakness Stakes. Background and early career Silver Charm was foaled in Florida on February 22, 1994 out of the mare Bonnie's Poker and sired by Silver Buck, who was a son of Buckpasser. He was a gray colt with a blaze and was bred by Mary Lou Wootton. As a two-year-old Silver Charm was purchased by trainer Bob Baffert for $85,000, and then resold to Beverly and Robert Lewis, who kept him in training with Baffert. Silver Charm's first win was as a two-year-old, in the Del Mar Futurity. Silver Charm entered the 1997 Kentucky Derby with Gary Stevens as his jockey. Silver Charm drew the sixth post position out of a field of 13, and broke well at the starting gate. He came out between other horses going into the backstretch and took the lead with less than a furlong to go. He won the Derby, finishing a head in front of Captain Bodgit. It was Baffert's second time entering the Kentucky Derby or any American classic race; his horse Cavonnier had come in second the year before. Silver Charm won the Preakness Stakes in the same manner, pulling ahead of Captain Bodgit and Free House just before the wire. Silver Charm lost the third jewel of the Triple Crown by placing second in the 1997 Belmont Stakes to Touch Gold; he lost by three quarters of a length. He was the winner of the 1997 Eclipse Award for Outstanding Three-Year-Old Male Horse. He closed out his sophomore season with a runner-up finish in the Malibu Stakes. Later racing career At age 4, Silver Charm won the 1998 Dubai World Cup, San Fernando Stakes, Strub Stakes, Kentucky Cup Classic Handicap, Goodwood Handicap (now called the Awesome Again Stakes), and the Clark Handicap. He also finished second in both the Stephen Foster Handicap and Breeders' Cup Classic.http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/110301/silver-charm- settling-in-well-at-old-friends At age 5, Silver Charm won the 1999 San Pasqual Handicap and placed third in both the Donn Handicap and Santa Anita Handicap. He also competed in the 1999 Dubai World Cup, finishing sixth. After his fourth-place finish in the Stephen Foster Handicap, Silver Charm was retired. Stud career Following the end of his race career, Silver Charm was retired to Three Chimneys Farm in Kentucky for an initial stud fee of $25,000. He stood stud in North America for five seasons, siring five crops of foals. In 2004 he was purchased by the Japanese Breeders Association, and was sent to stud in Japan. He stood at the Shizunai Stallion Station in December 2004. In 2008, he stood at the Shichinohe Stallion Station and in 2009, at the Iburi Stallion Station. Silver Charm's North American progeny features 15 stakes winners, most notably multiple graded stakes winners Preachinatthebar and Miss Isella. Silver Charm was not particularly successful in Japan, of 149 foals of racing age, he has been represented by one stakes-placed runner (in Korea). Overall, however, Silver Charm's progeny have made $2 million and won more than 1,000 races. Honors In the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century, Silver Charm was ranked #63. In 2007, Silver Charm was inducted into the United States Racing Hall of Fame. Retirement Silver Charm at Old Friends. Silver Charm went to Japan to the Shizunai Stallion Station in 2004, with a so-called \\"buy-back clause\\" included in his sales contract. Since the slaughterhouse death of Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand, the New York Owners and Breeder's Association has begun asking for a small voluntary per-race charge called the \\"Ferdinand Fee.\\" These monies are intended for the Bluegrass Charities and the Thoroughbred Charities of America to help fund racehorse rescue and retirement groups and keep horses from slaughter when their breeding or racing careers are over. This has led racehorse owners to include buy-back clauses within their stallion contracts.

Organisation and structure  The school is currently the largest in Wales (according to the school's last Estyn report) with 2400 pupils. In accordance with the three- tier system, it is divided between two sites, known as Upper and Lower. The Lower School site houses Years 7 to 9, with the Upper School providing facilities for years 10 and 11. The Upper School site also includes the Sixth Form Centre (Years 12 & 13). The school's Leadership Team is composed of the headteacher, two deputy headteachers and seven assistant headteachers. The current headteacher is Mark Powell, who took over from Hugh Jones Williams in September 2018. The school's uniform consists of a yellow and grey blazer, with a blue tie for Lower School and a maroon tie for Upper School.  Funding  In 2015‚Äì16 the school budget per pupil was ¬£4,411, amongst the lowest for secondary schools in Cardiff. For the 2017‚Äì18 Academic Year this was further reduced, and local media reproduced a letter which had been sent out to parents by the Chair of Governors regarding the financial difficulties the school was experiencing.  History  The first documented school in Whitchurch was on Old Church Road, opposite the now defunct St Mary's Church, adjacent to the Fox and Hounds Public House.Edgar Chappell, \\"Old Whitchurch\\" (Priory Press, 1945) Known as 'the Fox school-room', it was started in the nineteenth century, and was joined by a few small privately-run establishments to cater for the village's more affluent residents. The first half of the twentieth century saw the rapid growth of Whitchurch as a suburb of Cardiff, and with this growth came the need for more extensive educational provision. Under the terms of the Elementary Education Acts, Glamorgan County Council established the Whitchurch Elementary School on Glan-y-Nant Road (which later became Eglwys Newydd Primary), and then later in the 1930s a Secondary School on Glan-y-Nant Terrace as well as a Grammar School on Penlline Road. The current Whitchurch High School came into being in 1968, following the government circular of 1965, which replaced the existing tripartite system with comprehensive education. The new comprehensive school was created through a merger of the now well-established Whitchurch Grammar School, and Whitchurch County Secondary School, which had become a secondary modern school under the Butler Acts. The former Grammar School building became the Upper School, while the Secondary Modern became the Lower School. Like its predecessors, the school was co-educational and catered for a broad catchment area centred on the suburbs of Whitchurch, Rhiwbina and Tongwynlais in the northern part of Cardiff. The comprehensive school was initially run by Cardiff County Borough until the local government reform of 1974, which included Whitchurch in the new county of South Glamorgan. In 1996, the school reverted to Cardiff County Council, which became a unitary authority. Since merging both sites have seen extensive expansion, although both retain the original buildings as well as extensive playing fields. In September 2011, the school has been granted foundation status by the Welsh Assembly, following controversy over the local authority's proposals to reduce the school's intake. The school's badge is a white church tower on a blue background with the surround 'Album Monasterium', the Latin name for Whitchurch. In the 2010s, four former pupils reached the highest levels of their chosen sports; Sam Warburton captained Wales and the British and Irish Lions in Rugby Union, Gareth Bale played football for Real Madrid, Elliot Kear captained Wales in Rugby League and Geraint Thomas won two Olympic gold medals for cycling and won the 2018 Tour de France. All three had been coached by Steve Williams, a teacher at the school.  Curriculum  The school's Sixth Form school offers AS/A2 levels, a few stages of the Welsh Baccalaureate, and some vocational courses. Up until 2012, it was one of the few secondary schools in Wales to offer the International Baccalaureate.  Facilities  The school has a tradition in sport, music, drama and politics, with facilities such as: * A large, floodlit astroturf pitch on the lower school site used mainly for hockey and football (1997) * A sports recreational hall, located on the lower school site, opened by Prince Andrew, Duke of York. (2004) * A sports recreational hall with a fitness suite, changing rooms and classrooms located on the upper school site. (2006) * Ten floodlit, five a side football pitches with clubhouse and parking located on the lower school site. The facility is run by the private company Powerleague, and is available for community use outside of school hours. (2007) * Extensive, well drained playing fields on both the upper and lower school sites which are used for home matches by the schools rugby and football teams. * Traditional school gym with climbing equipment, ropes, gymnastic apparatus and crash mats on both the lower school site. * The Dutch Barn, formerly a derelict gym on the lower school site, has been converted into a hall used for school assemblies, and the annual Concerts * A purpose built music block on the lower school site (2009) * A dedicated drama studio. * A large vertical climbing wall and horizontal bouldering wall on the upper school site (2011) * 15 m swimming pool on the lower school site  Extracurricular activities  Whitchurch has a strong sports department and has produced many athletes who have represented Wales or Great Britain in recent years. The school was named Sports State School of the Year by 7th Annual Aviva Daily Telegraph \\"School Sports Matters\\" National Awards in November 2011 in recognition of its sporting achievements.

The prison was constructed in 1972. As of 2019, the warden is Ronald Erdos. The prison is perhaps best known for its April 1993 riot, in which a total of 450 prisoners rioted, resulting in an 11-day standoff between rioters and law enforcement. One corrections officer and nine inmates were killed during the riot. The riot has been described as one of the largest crises in Ohio prison history and one of the longest prison sieges in U.S. history. 1993 riot On Easter Sunday, April 11, 1993, 450 Lucasville inmates, including an unlikely alliance of the prison gangs: Gangster Disciples, Black Muslims and the Aryan Brotherhood, rioted and took over the facility for 11 days. The main causes were serious overcrowding and mismanagement of the facility and Muslim frustration stemming from mandated tuberculosis testing. In the Netflix documentary series Captive, inmate Siddique Abdullah Hasan (Carlos Sanders) claims that Muslim prisoners refused the test because it contained phenol, and therefore went against Islamic restrictions concerning the handling and consumption of alcohol. Investigations conducted after the riot found that the gangs were also collaborating to murder inmates accused of being informants. One corrections officer and nine inmates were killed during the riot. Five inmates believed to have been informants were beaten to death at the start of the riot. Two inmates were repeatedly stabbed to death and a third had paper and plastic stuffed into his mouth before being strangled to death by cords. During negotiations, the inmates did not feel they were being taken seriously and there was discussion of killing a corrections officer in retaliation. Though the group never reached a decision on the killing, one of the prisoners decided to act. According to the prosecution, Officer Robert Vallandingham, who had been taken hostage, was handcuffed and strangled with a dumbbell from the prison weight room. However, testimony by Dr. Richard Fardal, Franklin County Deputy Coroner, disputed the claim that Officer Vallandingham was killed by a weight, saying that there was \\"no injury to the voice box or the trachea\\" and that \\"Mr. Vallandingham died solely and exclusively as a result of ligature strangulation.\\" Testimonies vary as to which prisoner was responsible for his murder.Pfeifer, Paul. The Lucasville Prison Riot , Supreme Court of Ohio, May 18, 2005. Accessed June 30, 2009. During those 11 days, representatives from the Gangster Disciples, Black Muslims and Aryan Brotherhood, met every day in an improvised leadership council.Lynd, Staughton, et al. Wobblies and Zapatistas, p.113. The riot eventually ended after 11 days on April 21. Prison officials agreed to review the prisoners' complaints, which resulted in the prisoners' surrender. Communications issues experienced during the response to the riot contributed to the state's decision to build an interoperable statewide radio system. =Lucasville Five= Five prisoners described as the riot leaders were sentenced to death for their roles during the riot. They were known as the Lucasville Five: * Bomani Shakur (Keith LaMar) (born May 31, 1969, in Cleveland, Ohio), on Ohio Death Row, scheduled for execution on November 16, 2023. * Siddique Abdullah Hasan (Carlos A. Sanders) (born January 4, 1963), on Ohio Death Row awaiting execution. * Jason Harry Robb (born June 15, 1967), on Ohio Death Row awaiting execution. * George W. Skatzes (born March 29, 1946), on Ohio Death Row awaiting execution. * Namir Abdul Mateen (James Were) (born January 20, 1957), on Ohio Death Row awaiting execution. Bomani Shakur (Keith LaMar), unaffiliated with any of the above-mentioned groups, was sentenced to death in 1995 for his leadership of a group who killed inmates during the riot. He denies his leadership and claims the State of Ohio suppressed evidence that could demonstrate his innocence. He was not present in L-6 during the majority of the riot, having been taken off the rec yard the first day by the State authorities and housed in the K block. Following the riot, a class action was brought against the state officers, administrators and staff by a legal team headed by civil rights attorney Al Gerhardstein on behalf of the inmate victims of the riot. The state paid $4.1 million to settle the claims of the victims and agreed to a number of non-monetary terms as well, to remedy the overcrowding and mismanagement of the facility. Bomani Shakur (Keith LaMar) is scheduled to be executed on November 16, 2023. He is currently imprisoned at the Ohio State Penitentiary along with Siddique Abdullah Hasan (Carlos Sanders), Jason Robb and Namir Abdul Mateen (James Were). George Skatzes is imprisoned at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution. =2011 related hunger strike= On January 3, 2011, LaMar and Sanders began a twelve-day, liquid-only hunger strike at the Ohio State Penitentiary supermax prison in Youngstown, Ohio. On January 4, 2011, Robb joined the hunger strike. The three death-row inmates were living in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day. Additionally, they were restricted from using the internet to access news databases, denied access to the prison stores, and prohibited from physical contact with family. LaMar, Sanders and Robb desired the same treatment as the other Ohio death row-inmates and protested for equal prison conditions. The three death-row inmates demanded that they be granted additional time outside of their cells, physical contact with family members and access to the prison stores for additional clothing and food. At the time of the strike, David Bobby, the prison warden, concluded that he would not meet any of the prisoners' demands. However, by January 14, 2011, Bobby presented the inmates with a signed statement detailing the future policy changes. Due to growing public support and pressure from organizations such as human rights and legal scholars, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Center for Constitutional Rights, the prison was under pressure to change, which Birmingham University Professor Denis O'Hearn has credited as playing a decisive role in the hunger strike's success. The three inmates' demands were all granted, including limited physical contact with family, daily one hour phone calls, and additional time outside of the prison cell. By January 15, 2011, LaMar, Sanders and Robb had ended their hunger strike. Death row The Southern Ohio Correctional Facility is where condemned Ohio prisoners are executed; however, prisoners awaiting execution are not housed there on a long-term basis. Since the riots, the men's death row has been relocated three times. The first relocation was to the Mansfield Correctional Institution in Mansfield with the majority of inmates being moved later to the Ohio State Penitentiary, a supermax facility in Youngstown while a few remained at Mansfield. Currently, all but twelve condemned inmates are housed in a new death row unit at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution in Chillicothe. Six high-security inmates, four of whom were involved in the 1993 riot, remain at OSP with two others with serious medical conditions housed at the Franklin Medical Center in Columbus. Donna Roberts, the lone woman on Ohio's death row, as well as any future female prisoners sentenced to death, are and will be held at the Ohio Reformatory for Women in Marysville.

Although she is typically a non-speaker, her \\"meows\\" and \\"purrs\\" (or \\"le mews\\" and \\"le purrs\\") were most often provided by Mel Blanc using a feminine voice. The character did not originally have a permanent name; she was alternately referred to as Penelope, Fifi and Fabrette, and animator Chuck Jones' 1960 model sheet simply calls her \\"Le Cat\\". The name \\"Penelope Pussycat\\" was created retroactively for Warner Bros. marketing. The character first appeared in the 1949 short For Scent-imental Reasons, which won an Academy Award. While the skunk had been used in several earlier cartoons since Odor-able Kitty (1945), the addition of his female pussycat paramour in For Scent-imental Reasons solidified his characterization and the structure of all further Pep√© films. As the unfortunate target of unwanted physical attention, the character has been examined in feminist film criticism as an example of a \\"rape-revenge narrative\\"; however, this reading is complicated by the ending of some of the cartoons, which flip the dynamic and leave Pep√© as the unwilling recipient of the cat's affections. In the 1959 short Really Scent, she was voiced by June Foray, in the 1962 short Louvre Come Back to Me!, she was voiced by Julie Bennett, and in the 2000 film, Tweety's High-Flying Adventure, she was voiced by Frank Welker. Her first speaking role was in the 1995 short Carrotblanca, where she was voiced by Tress MacNeille. History Penelope Pussycat is best known as the often bewildered love interest of Looney Tunes' anthropomorphic skunk, Pep√© Le Pew. Penelope is a black and white cat, who often finds herself with a white stripe down her back, whether painted intentionally or by accident. She often finds herself being chased by the overly enthusiastic Pep√©, but when the occasion has presented itself, Penelope has been portrayed as the pursuer. For Scent-imental Reasons, Little Beau Pep√©, and Really Scent have all shown Penelope to harbor an attraction to Pep√© whenever his scent is neutralized (though in each cited instance, extenuating circumstances have caused Pep√© to become repulsed by her, inciting Penelope to reverse the roles). In current Warner Bros. merchandise, Penelope and Pep√© are portrayed as sharing a mutual attraction towards each other, whereas the Looney Tunes comic book series maintains their chasing relationship. Carrotblanca featured her as the Ilsa analogue to Bugs Bunny's Rick, with Sylvester portraying her husband and Pepe being a minor pursuer. Penelope Pussycat partly inspired the Tiny Toon Adventures character Furrball, a male cat who, in one episode, is chased by an amorous female skunk (Fifi La Fume) due to getting a white stripe painted down his back and tail. Penelope remained without an official name for many years. In the 1954 short, The Cat's Bah, her mistress referred to her as \\"Penelope\\". The name was later contradicted in the 1955 short, Two Scent's Worth, where she was identified as \\"Fifi\\". In the 1959 short, Really Scent, she was called \\"Fabrette\\". A model sheet from the early 1990s referred to the character as \\"Le Cat\\". The 1995 release of Carrotblanca (a parody of Casablanca) canonized her name as \\"Penelope Pussycat\\", with many advertisements for the short crediting her as \\"Penelope Pussycat in her first speaking role\\".

A Republican and temperance advocate, he served one term as the 36th Governor of Massachusetts, from 1890 to 1891. Born in New Hampshire and educated at Harvard, he practiced law in Boston before entering politics. In the Massachusetts House of Representatives, Brackett rose to become Speaker in 1885, and was elected Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts under Governor Oliver Ames. He succeeded Ames, but his bid for reelection in 1891 was ended by strict enforcement of restrictive liquor laws, and by the negative economic effects on the state of the McKinley Tariff. He was a delegate to the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1917‚Äì1918, but died before it ended.  Early years  John Quincy Adams Brackett was born on June 8, 1842, in Bradford, New Hampshire to Ambrose S. Brackett, a shoemaker and farmer, and Nancy (Brown) Brackett. He attended Colby Academy in nearby New London before entering Harvard College. He received a bachelor's from Harvard in 1865, where he was class orator, and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1868. He then opened a law practice in Boston,Reno, p. 39 first as a sole practititioner, and then in partnership with Levi C. Wade.Bacon, p. 24 He held the post of Judge Advocate of the Massachusetts Militia's First Brigade from 1874 to 1876.Rand, p. 72 He married Angie Moore Peck of Arlington, Massachusetts on June 20, 1878; they had four children.Bacon, p. 25  Early political career  Brackett was one of a number of progressive young Republicans who infused the party with new life in the 1880s, sometimes taking on and defeating older party members.Hennessy, p. 3 His entry into politics began on the Boston Common Council, on which he served 1873‚Äì1877. He next served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1877 to 1882 representing Boston from the 17th Suffolk District and again from 1884 to 1887.Journal of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, p. 911 He served on numerous committees, including as chair of the judiciary and rules committees. From 1885 to 1887 Brackett was Speaker of the House.Rand, p. 73 One of his major accomplishments as a legislator was the establishment of cooperative banks, which were designed to encourage thrift among the working class. As Speaker, he had to manage a highly contentious debate, including an attempted filibuster, of a bill creating a metropolitan Boston police force. Lieutenant Governor and Governor From 1887 to 1890 he served as the 34th Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts under Governor Oliver Ames. For significant portions of 1888 and 1889 Brackett served as acting governor due to Ames's illness, notably representing the state in that capacity at the celebration of the centennial of Ohio's settlement, and at the dedication of the Pilgrim Monument at Plymouth. In 1889, when Ames retired, Brackett ran to succeed him. He was supported within the party by a coalition of Blaine supporters (opposed by Mugwumps) and the liquor lobby. He won the party nomination by bypassing its main power brokers, Senators Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar and Henry L. Dawes, engaging instead in local ward level politicking. His victory in the general election, with just 48% of the popular vote, was one of the worst showings of any Republican governor in the state to date.Harmond, pp. 87‚Äì88 During his year in office, Brackett continued his advocacy of cooperative banks, securing legislation exempting their stock from state taxes. He also effectively advanced an agenda of tax reform and advocated improvements in Massachusetts prisons. In an action that would later prove controversial, Brackett signed legislation granting an exclusive charter for an elevated streetcar railway to the West End Street Railway,Hennessy, pp. 150‚Äì151 a predecessor to today's MBTA, Boston's public transit system. Henry Whitney, the West End's president, was criticized for the tactics he used to gain legislative approval for the charter, which included bribery of legislators, the retention of a large number of paid lobbyists (including former Governor William Gaston), and payment for favorable press in local newspapers.Cheape, pp. 123‚Äì128 The West End also did not immediately begin active use the charter, in part because of questions of high liability in the city's crowded business district, and over the suitability of extant elevated rail technology in Boston's geography. This failure to act brought further charges that the charter had been acquired to squelch competition.Cheape, pp. 124, 128 Brackett's term in office marked a low point in the state Republican party, and he was described by historian Richard Harmond as \\"pliable and mediocre\\".Harmond, p. 87 The party was internally divided between the Mugwumps and Blaine supporters, as well as between its younger and older leaders. The state's liquor control laws were a major subject that also caused the party some difficulty. Much of the party leadership was generally in favor of such laws, but opposed outright prohibition. For political purposes, the party had in 1886 formally declared support for a state constitutional amendment banning alcohol, but this had failed to draw significant support from the temperance community.Harmond, p. 92 A popular referendum for the enshrinement of prohibition in the Massachusetts State Constitution failed in 1889, upsetting advocates of prohibition, and Brackett took up their cause in a different way. Although he had opposed the amendment, he ordered stepped-up enforcement of the existing laws, which closed bars that did not serve food.Harmond, p. 93 There was a popular backlash, and Republican appeals to anti-Catholic nativist sentiment also drove many French-Canadian Catholic supporters into the Democratic fold.Harmond, pp. 96‚Äì98 These combined with the negative effects of the McKinley Tariff on the Massachusetts economy to cost Brackett reelection.Hennessy, pp. 3‚Äì5 He was defeated in the 1890 election by Democrat William E. RussellPetrin, pp. 198‚Äì199 in one of the most successful elections for Democrats in the state since the American Civil War.Hennessy, p. 2 Later years Brackett then returned to his Boston law practice, but remained active in his party. He refused to run for governor in 1891 against the popular Russell,Hennessy, p. 15 in 1892 he was a delegate to the Republican National Convention, and he served as a presidential elector in 1896 and 1900.Reno, p. 40 In 1917 he took an active role in the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1917‚Äì1918.Journal of the Constitutional Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, pp. 7‚Äì8 In 1887 Brackett built a Queen Anne style home at 87 Pleasant Street, Arlington, Massachusetts where he lived until his death in 1918. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Arlington Center Historic District, and is also part of the local Pleasant Street Historic District. The Brackett School at 66 Eastern Avenue in Arlington, first built in 1931, was named after him.

Starting in the Fall of 2012, it plans to return to the air as an internet- only radio station. The original purpose of the station was to provide real- world education in the field of radio broadcasting to students enrolled in the Creative Communications program at Red River College and to deliver programming distinct from that offered by other radio stations within the city. In November 2003, CITI-FM (Winnipeg) and CKKQ-FM (Victoria) personality and programmer Rick Baverstock was hired as the station manager for CKIC-FM. Kick-FM is owned and operated by the non-profit corporation, Cre-Comm Radio, Inc. History The station began broadcasting a test signal on December 15, 2003 and officially launched on April 27, 2004. Initially, the station followed a Triple-A format. At the time, this was the first of its kind in Canada. Kick-FM used the tag line 'A Rock 'n' Soul Adventure' for the first year of its existence. With the arrival of short-lived CKFE-FM, Kick-FM migrated to a unique Modern Rock format. The selections featured songs popular in the UK and at College radio in the U.S. In addition, Kick-FM played more Winnipeg-based musicians than any other station in the city (22% of its play list). The majority of music on Kick-FM's play list was unique to this station, with little overlap from other stations. After several years as \\"Winnipeg's New Sound,\\" Kick-FM began to identify itself as \\"Winnipeg's Indie Station - Independent Rock, Independent Talk.\\" The musical emphasis swung away from the more established alternative artists (now being played locally by CURVE 94.3, see CHIQ-FM) and now concentrates on music by unsigned, independent artists. For four years, the station also hosted a weekday talk program by citizen journalist, blogger, community activist and government critic, Marty Gold. This program was abruptly taken off the air by the board running the station, soon after a new President took office at Red River College.Cancellation of ‚ÄúGreat Canadian Talk Show‚Äù at Canadian Campus- Community Station Draws Ire.

It followed directly after the Elster glaciation and came before the Saale glaciation, during the Middle Pleistocene. The more precise timing is controversial since Holstein is commonly correlated to two different marine isotope stages, MIS 11Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy, Global chronostratigraphical correlation table for the last 2.7 million years, v. 2011 (424-374 thousand years ago) and MIS 9German Stratigraphic Commission: Stratigraphische Tabelle von Deutschland 2016 (337-300 thousand years ago). This ambiguity is much related to the correlation problem described in more detail in the article 'Elster glaciation'.  Definition  The Holstein interglacial is defined by marine sedimentation. On the stratigraphic record at the natural monument of :de:Sievertsche Tongrube in Hamburg-Hummelsb√ºttel, its development is traced from the Elster ice age (Lauenburg clay) through the start of the warm period (freshwater depositions) to its flooding by the Holstein Sea (Cardien Sands).Grube, E.-F.

It was written in 1041 or 1042, probably by a monk of Saint-Omer. Manuscripts Until 2008, it was believed that there was just a single manuscript surviving from that time. Kept in the British Library, it is lavishly illustrated and believed to be the copy sent to Queen Emma or a close reproduction of that copy. One leaf has been lost from the manuscript in modern times but its text survives in late paper copies. Then a new manuscript, the Courtenay Compendium, was found in the papers of the Earl of Devon at the Devon Record Office. This version however is believed to have been compiled in 1043, around two years after the other surviving text. It adds detail to the content, showing the rise and succession of Edward the Confessor in a very positive light. The first manuscript offers him just a fleeting mention. The new manuscript has been acquired by the Royal Library of Denmark. Date and provenance It is usually thought that the text was written in 1041 or 1042, in response to a politically delicate situation, which had arisen recently at the English court.Stafford, Queen Emma, p. 28. Harthacnut (reigned 1040‚Äì42), Emma's son by Cnut, was king of England, and Edward, her son by √Üthelred, had been invited back from exile in Normandy and sworn in as Harthacnut's successor. The concurrent presence of a king and another claimant to the throne was a recipe for unrest, especially considering that Edward's brother, √Ülfred (died 1036), had earlier been betrayed (as rumour had it, at the instigation of Earl Godwine).Stafford, Queen Emma, p. 29. As the portrait above emphasises, the work appears to have been directed specifically at Harthacnut and Edward, instilling a message about their past and future. As such, the Encomium is a heavily biased and selective work. Commissioned by Queen Emma herself, it strives to show her and Cnut in as favourable a light as possible. So it silently glosses over Emma's first marriage to √Üthelred the Unready, contests that Harold Harefoot, Cnut's son by his first wife √Ülfgifu, was indeed a son of Cnut, and places the blame for √Ülfred's murder squarely on Harold.Tyler, \\"Talking about history\\", p. 361.Encomium Emmae Reginae, ed. Campbell, Bk II. ch. 16‚Äì7, 18, Bk III., ch. 1. Despite its shortcomings the Encomium is an important primary source for early 11th-century English and Scandinavian history. Authorship The anonymous author, often simply referred to as \\"The Encomiast\\", was probably a Flemish monk, as he identifies himself in the text as a monk of St Bertin's or St Omer's. He mentions that he wrote the work at the specific request of his patroness Emma, to whom he shows some gratitude, and that he had witnessed Cnut when the king visited the abbey on his journey homeward.Campbell, Encomium, p. xix. Form and content The form and style of the text show much indebtedness to classical authors. Virgil and his Aeneid are explicitly cited in the prefatory letter and in Book I, Chapter 4, while influences from Sallust, Lucan, Ovid, Horace, Juvenal and Lucretius have also been detected.Tyler, \\"Talking about history\\", p. 362. The Encomium divides into three books. The first deals with Sweyn Forkbeard and his conquest of England. The second deals with his son, Cnut the Great, his reconquest of England, his marriage to Emma and his period of rule. The third book deals with events after Cnut's death: Emma's troubles during the reign of Harold Harefoot and the accession of her sons, Harthacnut and Edward the Confessor to the throne.

Early life and education Duncan is native to Greenville, South Carolina. His father was an eighth-generation Southern Presbyterian ruling elder. Duncan graduated from Greenville Senior High School in 1979 and Furman University in 1983 (B.A., History). He continued his studies at Covenant Theological Seminary with an MDiv in 1986 and an MA in historical theology in 1987. He completed doctoral studies in theology at the University of Edinburgh, New College in 1995. He served on the staff of Covenant Presbyterian Church, St. Louis, (1984‚Äì1987). He was licensed to preach in 1985 by the Presbytery of Calvary (PCA) in South Carolina, and ordained in 1990. Institutional and organizational involvement =Reformed Theological Seminary= In the Summer of 1990, Duncan joined the faculty of Reformed Theological Seminary (RTS), Jackson, Mississippi, as the John R. Richardson Chair of Systematic Theology. At the same time he served as assistant pastor of Trinity Presbyterian Church, Jackson, Mississippi (1990‚Äì1995), and interim pastor at First Presbyterian Church, Yazoo City, Mississippi (1993). Effective January 1, 2014, Duncan resigned his position as Sr. Minister at First Presbyterian Church, Jackson, MS, and assumed the role of Chancellor of Reformed Theological Seminary. He continues to teach in the department of Systematic Theology while serving in this role. =First Presbyterian Church and the PCA= Duncan was named senior pastor at First Presbyterian Church of Jackson, Mississippi (PCA) in 1996, and served in that capacity until early 2014. An active churchman, he has been involved in the courts of the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) in various ways: General Assembly's Committee on Psalmody; Committees of Commissioners for Covenant Theological Seminary, Mission to North America, and Bills and Overtures; member and chair of the Credentials Committee of the Presbytery of the Mississippi Valley (1996‚Äì2002); vice-chair of the General Assembly's Creation Study Committee (1998‚Äì2000); member of the search committee for a Coordinator of Reformed University Ministries; chair of the General Assembly's Theological Examination Committee; member of the PCA's Strategic Planning Committee; moderator of the Presbytery of the Mississippi Valley (2001); moderator of the PCA General Assembly (2004), making him the youngest elected to this position in the denomination's history. =Other Organizations= He was the former president of the Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals,Ligon Duncan , Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals a broad coalition of evangelical Christians from various denominations. It aims to call the church to repent of what it see as its worldliness, and to take up the mantle of the Protestant reformers in recovering the centrality of worship and doctrine in the life of the church. In his capacity as president, Duncan regularly spoke at the Philadelphia Conference on Reformed Theology, an Alliance-related forum that offers quarterly conferences on Reformed doctrine and history. He also contributes to the Alliance's online magazine and blog, Reformation21. He is also a council member of the Gospel Coalition, a \\"group of (mostly) pastors and churches in the Reformed heritage who delight in the truth and power of the gospel, and who want the gospel of Christ crucified and resurrected to lie at the center of all we cherish, preach, and teach.\\" They have created The Gospel Coalition Network, which is a consortium of \\"Christian pastors and other leaders who stimulate one another to faithfulness and fruitfulness in life and ministry in this rapidly-changing, increasingly urbanized, and spiritually hungry world.\\" Theological and Social Positions In 2017, Duncan signed the Nashville Statement. =Gender Roles= Duncan holds to a complementarian view of gender roles.Recovering: Chapter 2 He believes that 1 Corinthians 14:34, which says 'women should keep silent in the churches', refers to women teaching men (like found in 1Timothy 2:12), This puts him at odds with the popular view espoused by Wayne Grudem and Don Carson who insist that the context shows that Paul is prohibiting women from publicly judging prophecy in the church.see Question 25, also see footnote on p144 in Wayne Grudem's book Countering the Claims of Evangelical Feminism (or the footnote on p233 in the full length version Evangelical Feminism and Biblical Truth) for references to more detailed treatments of this question. In the church he serves, men teach mixed adult Sunday school classes, occasionally husband/wife teams teach on issues such as parenting and marriage.

It has a population of 1500; but in the past it had 2500. The place lies over a hill and it is surrounded by a wall that the King Sancho the Strong ordered to build. There are still preserved five different entries to access the city. Their names are: Mercadal, Carnicer√≠as (Butchers), P√°ganos, San Juan and Santa Engracia. Additionally, the streets and surroundings of Laguardia still keep a medieval atmosphere that give the city an ancient touch. Regarding the economy, its main strength is the wine industry. Indeed, the wine is elaborated and processed in numerous wineries. Toponym During the Middle Ages, it appeared with names such as Leguarda, Giardia, Guard, Guoardia, Lagarde, and Laguoardia until the current name was finally fixed. Indeed, the full and complete name with which the town is known currently is La Guardia de Navarra Sonsierra. There has been some controversy about the Basque name of the town. In the late nineteenth century, the belief that before granting the \\"letter of villazgo\\" in 1164, the population of Laguardia was called Biasteri had spread. Many people saw \\"Biasteri\\" as a name of Basque origin and folk etymologies such as \\"bi haitz herri\\" became popular. As a consequence, the term Biasteri was used as the Basque name of the town until recently. Nevertheless, in the late twentieth century, philologists and historians reached the conclusion after some research that Biasteri was the ancient name given to the nearby town of Vi√±aspre, not of Laguardia. Therefore, the association made until that date was not correct, and the Basque Language Academy, Euskaltzaindia, ruled that the Basque standard name of the town is Guardia. Neighborhoods Laguardia has three separate neighborhoods: *The Campillar. It is 7.5 km from the city center, near the Ebro River and it has 28 inhabitants. *Laserna: It is 11 km from the city center and it is separated from the rest of the municipality by a meander of the river Ebro. It has 43 inhabitants. *P√°ganos: It is 3.5 km away and it has 87 inhabitants. History Laguardia has a rich historical past. At a place called La Hoya, there is an important archaeological site. It is a pre-Roman settlement of Celtiberian of Berona ethnic and it covers an extensive period of more than a thousand years or so since the twelfth century BC to the second century BC. Additionally, the town received certain privileges regarding jurisdiction during the reign of the king of Navarre Sancho VI \\"El Sabio\\" in 1164. The initial demarcation covered areas from \\"Las Conchas de Haro\\" to \\"Soto Inigo Galindez\\", in the current term of Viana. It was the beginning of the community of \\"Villa y Tierra\\" . Eventually, new villas were created in the surroundings changing the focus of attention to other territories such as San Vicente, Labraza and Viana. In any case, it was the main square of the Sonsierra of Navarra during most part of the medieval period. Economy As mentioned above, the core of the economy in Laguardia focuses on the world of viticulture (grape growing, winemaking and wine industry). Laguardia is the capital of one of the most famous wine regions of Spain, Rioja Alavesa. Additionally, both in Laguardia and its surroundings, a wine known as the Denominaci√≥n de Origen Calificada Rioja which is useful to distinguish particular vines produces in some specific regions. Monuments and places worth visiting *The Wall: the high walls surrounding the town are about two meters high, They are made of stone. It has five doors that lead to the villa. *The Church of Santa Maria de los Reyes, which in the past was probably a Templar monastery. Next to it, there is a tower called the Tower of Santa Maria or Torre abbey (it is believed that the abbot lived there). The tower has a remarkable Gothic fa√ßade with a portico that is conserved almost intact, indeed, the carving was finished in the fourteenth century and it was polychromed in the seventeenth. It is one of the few preserved polychrome portals in Spain (in Toro (Zamora) there is another one). The sizes of the archivolts represent the Apostles and the porch tells the story of the Holy Virgin. *The Church of San Juan, which initially was built in Romanesque style and finally completed in the Gothic style. It has an attached chapel of the eighteenth century, dedicated to the Virgin of Pilar. Its bell tower belonged originally to a castle. *The Hermitage of Santa Mar√≠a de Berberana. It is Romanesque and the only church in the whole Rioja Alavesa which possesses a square apse. *Plaza Mayor: It is in the center of the town. Tourists can find there both the new and the old townhall. The latter shows on its facade the shield of the villa and a chiming clock with automata that at 12, 14, 17 and 20 hours dance to the rhythm of a typical parade of the celebrations of the town. *Renaissance Old Town Hall: It has an imperial shield of Charles V. *The Capuchin convent. *Prehistoric remains of some dolmens and a Celtic village in the town of La Hoya. Furthermore, there is also a Celtic pond. *The Birthplace of the fabulist F√©lix Mar√≠a de Samaniego. It is a seventeenth-century palace that houses the tourist office. Notable people *Blanche of Navarre (1133‚Äì1156), Queen of Castile. *Felix Maria Samaniego (1745‚Äì1801), a writer of fables. His birthplace is a house of the seventeenth century, which is still preserved and dedicated to wine museum. *√ìscar de Marcos (born 1989), professional footballer. Music The town of Laguardia has always been known for having among its inhabitants talented musicians in all its aspects. Thus, several generations of bagpipers have led to the Day of the Piper, one of the most important festivals, held in honor of illustrious pipers of this town and its surroundings. They are also an important part of the musical history of the people and their municipal band, which has been active for 130 years. Also, several rock groups, such as: \\"Tubo Skape\\" or \\"All√° Cuidaos\\" are part of the musical history town. Sports The town has a football team of Regional Division. An earlier formation competed in the Regional League of La Rioja. In 1967, the sixteenth stage of the Cycling Tour of Spain started in Laguardia, a time trial finishing in Vitoria. The winner was the French Raymond Poulidor. References *2007 - lyrical Epistles. Correspondence with Antonio Lezama. Editorial Buscarini(Collection 'The Printing of Armando', 1).

It occurs in nature as zircon, a silicate mineral. Powdered zirconium silicate is also known as zircon flour. Zirconium silicate is usually colorless, but impurities induce various colorations. It is insoluble in water, acids, alkali and aqua regia. Hardness is 7.5 on the Mohs scale. Production Zirconium silicate occurs in nature as mineral zircon. Ore is mined from natural deposits and concentrated by various techniques. It is separated from sand by electrostatic and electromagnetic methods. It can also be synthesized by fusion of SiO2 and ZrO2 in an arc furnace, or by reacting a zirconium salt with sodium silicate in an aqueous solution. Uses Zirconium silicate is used for manufacturing refractory materials for applications where resistance to corrosion by alkali materials is required. It is also used in production of some ceramics, enamels, and ceramic glazes. In enamels and glazes it serves as an opacifier. It can be also present in some cements. Another use of zirconium silicate is as beads for milling and grinding. Thin films of zirconium silicate and hafnium silicate produced by chemical vapor deposition, most often MOCVD, can be used as a high-k dielectric as a replacement for silicon dioxide in semiconductors. Zirconium silicates have also been studied for potential use in medical applications. For example, ZS-9 is a zirconium silicate that was designed specifically to trap potassium ions over other ions throughout the gastrointestinal tract. It is undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of hyperkalemia. Zirconium disilicate is used in some dental crowns because of its hardness and because it is chemically nonreactive.

Unihemispheric slow-wave sleep (USWS) is sleep where one half of the brain rests while the other half remains alert. This is in contrast to normal sleep where both eyes are shut and both halves of the brain show unconsciousness. In USWS, also known as asymmetric slow-wave sleep, one half of the brain is in deep sleep, a form of non-rapid eye movement sleep and the eye corresponding to this half is closed while the other eye remains open. When examined by low-voltage electroencephalography (EEG), the characteristic slow-wave sleep tracings are seen from one side while the other side shows a characteristic tracing of wakefulness. The phenomenon has been observed in a number of terrestrial, aquatic and avian species. Unique physiology, including the differential release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, has been linked to the phenomenon. USWS offers a number of benefits, including the ability to rest in areas of high predation or during long migratory flights. The behaviour remains an important research topic because USWS is possibly the first animal behaviour which uses different regions of the brain to simultaneously control sleep and wakefulness. The greatest theoretical importance of USWS is its potential role in elucidating the function of sleep by challenging various current notions. Researchers have looked to animals exhibiting USWS to determine if sleep must be essential; otherwise, species exhibiting USWS would have eliminated the behaviour altogether through evolution. The amount of time spent sleeping during the unihemispheric slow- wave stage is considerably less than the bilateral slow-wave sleep. In the past, aquatic animals, such as dolphins and seals, had to regularly surface in order to breathe and regulate body temperature. USWS might have been generated by the need of getting simultaneously these vital activities in addition to sleep. Despite the reduced sleep quantity, species having USWS do not present limits at a behavioral or healthy level. Cetaceans, such as dolphins, show a preserved health as well as great memory skills. Indeed, cetaceans, seals and birds compensate for the lack of complete sleep thanks to their efficient immune system, brain plasticity, thermoregulation and restoration of brain energy metabolism. Physiology Polysomnogram demonstrating slow-wave sleep. High amplitude EEG is highlighted in red. Slow-wave sleep (SWS), also known as Stage 3, is characterized by a lack of movement and difficulty of arousal. Slow-wave sleep occurring in both hemispheres is referred to as bihemispheric slow-wave sleep (BSWS) and is common among most animals. Slow-wave sleep contrasts with rapid eye movement sleep (REM), which can only occur simultaneously in both hemispheres. In most animals, slow-wave sleep is characterized by high amplitude, low frequency EEG readings. This is also known as the desynchronized state of the brain, or deep sleep. In USWS, only one hemisphere exhibits the deep sleep EEG while the other hemisphere exhibits an EEG typical of wakefulness with a low amplitude and high frequency. There also exist instances in which hemispheres are in transitional stages of sleep, but they have not been the subject of study due to their ambiguous nature. USWS represents the first known behavior in which one part of the brain controls sleep while another part controls wakefulness. Generally, when the whole amount of sleeping of each hemisphere is summed, both hemispheres get equal amounts of USWS. However, when every single session is taken into account, a large asymmetry of USWS episodes can be observed. This information suggests that at one time the neural circuit is more active in one hemisphere than on the other one and vice versa the following time. According to Fuller, awakening is characterized by high activity of neural groups that promote awakening: they activate the cortex as well as subcortical structures and simultaneously inhibit neural groups which promotes sleep. Therefore, sleep is defined by the opposite mechanism. It can be assumed that cetaceans show a similar structure, but the neural groups are stimulated according to the need of each hemisphere. So, neural mechanisms that promote sleep are predominant in the sleeping hemisphere, while the ones that promote awakening are more active in the non-sleeping hemisphere. =Role of acetylcholine= Due to the origin of USWS in the brain, neurotransmitters are believed to be involved in its regulation. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine has been linked to hemispheric activation in northern fur seals. Researchers studied seals in controlled environments by observing behaviour as well as through surgically implanted EEG electrodes. Acetylcholine is released in nearly the same amounts per hemisphere in bilateral slow-wave sleep. However, in USWS, the maximal release of the cortical acetylcholine neurotransmitter is lateralized to the hemisphere exhibiting an EEG trace resembling wakefulness. The hemisphere exhibiting SWS is marked by the minimal release of acetylcholine. This model of acetylcholine release has been further discovered in additional species such as the bottlenose dolphin. =Eye opening= In domestic chicks and other species of birds exhibiting USWS, one eye remained open contra-lateral (on the opposite side) to the \\"awake\\" hemisphere. The closed eye was shown to be opposite the hemisphere engaging in slow-wave sleep. Learning tasks, such as those including predator recognition, demonstrated the open eye could be preferential. This has also been shown to be the favored behavior of belugas, although inconsistencies have arisen directly relating the sleeping hemisphere and open eye. Keeping one eye open aids birds in engaging in USWS while mid- flight as well as helping them observe predators in their vicinity. Given that USWS is preserved also in blind animals or during a lack of visual stimuli, it cannot be considered as a consequence of keeping an eye open while sleeping. Furthermore, the open eye in dolphins does not forcibly activate the contralateral hemisphere. Although unilateral vision plays a considerable role in keeping active the contralateral hemisphere, it is not the motive power of USWS. Consequently, USWS might be generated by endogenous mechanisms. =Thermoregulation= Brain temperature has been shown to drop when a sleeping EEG is exhibited in one or both hemispheres. This decrease in temperature has been linked to a method to thermoregulate and conserve energy while maintaining the vigilance of USWS. The thermoregulation has been demonstrated in dolphins and is believed to be conserved among species exhibiting USWS. Anatomical variations =Smaller corpus callosum= USWS requires hemispheric separation to isolate the cerebral hemispheres enough to ensure that the one can engage in SWS while the other is awake. The corpus callosum is the anatomical structure in the mammalian brain which allows for interhemispheric communication. Cetaceans have been observed to have a smaller corpus callosum when compared to other mammals. Similarly, birds lack a corpus callosum altogether and have only few means of interhemispheric connections. Other evidence contradicts this potential role; sagittal transsections of the corpus callosum have been found to result in strictly bihemispheric sleep. As a result, it seems this anatomical difference, though well correlated, does not directly explain the existence of USWS. =Noradrenergic diffuse modulatory system variations= A promising method of identifying the neuroanatomical structures responsible for USWS is continuing comparisons of brains that exhibit USWS with those that do not. Some studies have shown induced asynchronous SWS in non-USWS-exhibiting animals as a result of sagittal transactions of subcortical regions, including the lower brainstem, while leaving the corpus callosum intact. Other comparisons found that mammals exhibiting USWS have a larger posterior commissure and increased decussation of ascending fibres from the locus coeruleus in the brainstem. This is consistent with the fact that one form for neuromodulation, the noradrenergic diffuse modulatory system present in the locus coeruleus, is involved in regulating arousal, attention, and sleep-wake cycles. During USWS the proportion of noradrenergic secretion is asymmetric. It is indeed high in the awaken hemisphere and low in the sleeping one. The continuous discharge of noradrenergic neurons stimulates heat production: the awake hemisphere of dolphins shows a higher, but stable, temperature. On the contrary, the sleeping hemisphere reports a slightly lower temperature compared to the other hemisphere. According to researchers, the difference in hemispheric temperatures may play a role in shifting between the SWS and awaken status. =Complete crossing of the optic nerve= Complete crossing (decussation) of the nerves at the optic chiasm in birds has also stimulated research. Complete decussation of the optic tract has been seen as a method of ensuring the open eye strictly activates the contralateral hemisphere. Some evidence indicates that this alone is not enough as blindness would theoretically prevent USWS if retinal nerve stimuli were the sole player. However, USWS is still exhibited in blinded birds despite the absence of visual input. Benefits Many species of birds and marine mammals have advantages due to their unihemispheric slow-wave sleep capability, including, but not limited to, increased ability to evade potential predators and the ability to sleep during migration. Unihemispheric sleep allows visual vigilance of the environment, preservation of movement, and in cetaceans, control of the respiratory system. =Adaptation to high-risk predation= Most species of birds are able to detect approaching predators during unihemispheric slow-wave sleep. During the flight, birds maintain visual vigilance by utilizing USWS and by keeping one eye open. The utilization of unihemispheric slow-wave sleep by avian species is directly proportional to the risk of predation. In other words, the usage of USWS of certain species of birds increases as the risk of predation increases. Survival of the fittest adaptation The evolution of both cetaceans and birds may have involved some mechanisms for the purpose of increasing the likelihood of avoiding predators. Certain species, especially of birds, that acquired the ability to perform unihemispheric slow-wave sleep had an advantage and were more likely to escape their potential predators over other species that lacked the ability. Regulation based on surroundings Birds can sleep more efficiently with both hemispheres sleeping simultaneously (bihemispheric slow-wave sleep) when in safe conditions, but will increase the usage of USWS if they are in a potentially more dangerous environment. It is more beneficial to sleep using both hemispheres; however, the positives of unihemispheric slow-wave sleep prevail over its negatives under extreme conditions. While in unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, birds will sleep with one open eye towards the direction from which predators are more likely to approach. When birds do this in a flock, it's called the \\"group edge effect\\". The mallard is one bird that has been used experimentally to illustrate the \\"group edge effect\\". Birds positioned at the edge of the flock are most alert, scanning often for predators. These birds are more at risk than the birds in the center of the flock and are required to be on the lookout for both their own safety and the safety of the group as a whole. They have been observed spending more time in unihemispheric slow-wave sleep than the birds in the center. Since USWS allows for the one eye to be open, the cerebral hemisphere that undergoes slow-wave sleep varies depending on the position of the bird relative to the rest of the flock. If the bird's left side is facing outward, the left hemisphere will be in slow-wave sleep; if the bird's right side is facing outward, the right hemisphere will be in slow-wave sleep. This is because the eyes are contra-lateral to the left and right hemispheres of the cerebral cortex. The open eye of the bird is always directed towards the outside of the group, in the direction from which predators could potentially attack. =Surfacing for air and pod cohesion= Unihemispheric slow-wave sleep seems to allow the simultaneous sleeping and surfacing to breathe of aquatic mammals including both dolphins and seals. Bottlenose dolphins are one specific species of cetaceans that have been proven experimentally to use USWS in order to maintain both swimming patterns and the surfacing for air while sleeping. In addition, a reversed version of the \\"group edge effect\\" has been observed in pods of Pacific white-sided dolphins. Dolphins swimming on the left side of the pod has their right eyes open while dolphins swimming on the right side of the pod have their left eyes open. Unlike in some species of birds, the open eyes of these cetaceans are facing the inside of the group, not the outside. The dangers of possible predation do not play a significant role during USWS in Pacific white-sided dolphins. It has been suggested that this species utilizes this reversed version of the \\"group edge effect\\" in order to maintain pod formation and cohesion while maintaining unihemispheric slow-wave sleep. =Rest during long bird flights= While migrating, birds may undergo unihemispheric slow-wave sleep in order to simultaneously sleep and visually navigate flight. Certain species may thus avoid a need to make frequent stops along the way. Certain bird species are more likely to utilize USWS during soaring flight, but it is possible for birds to undergo USWS in flapping flight as well. Much is still unknown about the usage of unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, since the inter- hemispheric EEG asymmetry that is viewed in idle birds may not be equivalent to that of birds that are flying. Species exhibiting USWS Although humans show reduced left-hemisphere delta waves during slow-wave sleep in an unfamiliar bedchamber, this is not wakeful alertness of USWS, which is impossible in humans. =Aquatic mammals= Cetaceans Of all the cetacean species, USWS has been found to be exhibited in the following species *Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis) *Beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucus) *Bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncates) *Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) *Pilot whale (Globicephala scammoni) *Porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) Pinnipeds Though pinnipeds are capable of sleeping on either land or water, it has been found that pinnipeds that exhibit USWS do so at a higher rate while sleeping in water. Though no USWS has been observed in true seals, four different species of eared seals have been found to exhibit USWS including *Northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) : Significant research has been done illustrating that the northern fur seal can alternate between BSWS and USWS depending on its location while sleeping. While on land, 69% of all SWS is present bilaterally; however, when sleep takes place in water, 68% of all SWS is found with interhemispheric EEG asymmetry, indicating USWS. *Southern sea lion (Otari bryonia) *Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) Sirenia In the final order of aquatic mammals, sirenia, experiments have only exhibited USWS in the Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis). =Birds= Common swift The common swift (Apus apus) was the best candidate for research aimed at determining whether or not birds exhibiting USWS can sleep in flight. The selection of the common swift as a model stemmed from observations elucidating the fact that the common swift left its nest at night, only returning in the early morning. Still, evidence for USWS is strictly circumstantial and based on the notion that if swifts must sleep to survive, they must do so via aerial roosting as little time is spent sleeping in a nest. Multiple other species of birds have also been found to exhibit USWS including *Common blackbird (Turdus merula) *Domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), *Glaucous-winged gull (Larus glaucescens) *Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) *Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). *Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), *Orange-fronted parakeet (Aratinga canicularis) *Peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) *White-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii) Future research Recent studies have illustrated that the white- crowned sparrow, as well as other passerines, have the capability of sleeping most significantly during the migratory season while in flight. However, the sleep patterns in this study were observed during migratory restlessness in captivity and might not be analogous to those of free-flying birds. Free- flying birds might be able to spend some time sleeping while in non-migratory flight as well when in the unobstructed sky as opposed to in controlled captive conditions. To truly determine if birds can sleep in flight, recordings of brain activity must take place during flight instead of after landing. A method of recording brain activity in pigeons during flight has recently proven promising in that it could obtain an EEG of each hemisphere but for relatively short periods of time. Coupled with simulated wind tunnels in a controlled setting, these new methods of measuring brain activity could elucidate the truth behind whether or not birds sleep during flight. Additionally, based on research elucidating the role of acetylcholine in control of USWS, additional neurotransmitters are being researched to understand their roles in the asymmetric sleep model.

Doc. No.1, Vol. II, Cornelius Wendell, Washington, 1856, pp.206-209 In 1851, Nugent became owner-editor of The San Francisco Herald. In 1856 he opposed the re-establishment of the San Francisco Committee of Vigilance, an extra-legal organization for the preservation of law and order. His failure to support it was an unpopular editorial decision that caused the paper to collapse a few years later in 1860. This was an event from which his career never recovered although he continued in journalism and an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate. The part of his career that is of most interest to historians began in 1858 when President James Buchanan appointed Nugent special agent to New Caledonia (British Columbia). Buchanan wanted to see how Americans and their interests were faring in the area in light of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. Nugent quickly discovered that there was little tension and good relations between the Americans and the British. Nugent appears to have created a rift through a dispute with Governor James Douglas over the treatment of American citizens in the courts. He further suggested that the Americans would intervene quickly if conflict arose. This came out of the feeling he had that New Caledonia and Vancouver Island should and would be annexed to the United States. The diplomatic difficulties were not great and the negativity fell on John Nugent personally. Later in life John Nugent married and had children.The Overland Monthly, p. 495 He married Magdalena Estudillo on August 26, 1860.

It won the Weaver Award for Scholarly Literature, awarded by the Ingersoll Foundation, in 1992. Summary Burkert's core thesis is that when paleolithic man became a hunter, in spite of the generally omnivorous orientation of the great apes, lack of a predator instinct was made up for by turning patterns of intra-species aggression against the prey: Homo necans means \\"man the killer\\". Thus, the animal hunted by ancient man automatically acquired aspects of an equal, as if it were of one of the hunter's relations. In a first attempt at applying ethology to religious history,Burkert 1983: \\"Introduction\\" p. xiii; Burkert in his introduction to the English edition remarked upon the emergence of sociobiology. Burkert confronts the power and effect of tradition in uncovering traces of ancient hunting rituals so motivated in historical animal sacrifice and human sacrifice (by his thesis unified as deriving from the same fundamental principle) in specific historical Greek rituals with relevance to human religious behaviour in general. Burkert acknowledges that a decisive impulse for the thesis derived from Konrad Lorenz' On Aggression (1963). The thesis is an extension of the hunting hypothesis, which states that hunting as a means of obtaining food was a dominant influence on human evolution and cultural development (as opposed to gathering vegetation or scavenging). The guilt incurred in the violence of the hunt was reflected in sacred crimes, which through rituals of cleansing and expiation served to unify communities. Burkert supports his thesis by integrating a multitude of examples that elaborate primitive ritual as it is reflected in Greek mythology. He examines various cult-complexes in detail, confronting \\"sacrificial ritual with its tension between encountering death and affirming life, its external form consisting of preparations, a frightening central moment, and restitution\\",Burkert 1983:83. and affirming in detail the initial hypothesis. Reception Homo Necans was conceived in the 1960s; it controversially introduced functionalism, along the lines of Jane Ellen Harrison's Themis, to a German audience, and employed a form of structuralism in interpreting complexes of ritual and festival, to apply some findings of ethology for the first time to mythology. Ren√© Girard's Violence and the Sacred appeared the same year. The book that was controversial at its first appearance was less revolutionary when it finally appeared in English, Burkert noted, in an introduction to the English translation (1983). The historian Peter Gay praised Homo Necans as a suggestive discussion of the impulse to revenge. Robert Parker, in reviewing Homo Necans for The Times Literary Supplement, observed of Burkert that \\"boldness of theory and consummate learning are united in him as in few others\\". M.L.

History Cheese making at the Affoltern dairy Affoltern is first mentioned in 1261/63 as Affolterra. The oldest trace of a settlement in the area comes from the Middle Ages. The village church of St. Michael was first mentioned in 1275. It remained a local chapel until 1484 when Teutonic Knights Commandry of Sumiswald provided funding for a permanent parish priest. In 1528 Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and Affoltern converted. However, the Commandry retained patronage rights over the church until 1698. By the 18th century many local farmers were raising cattle for meat and milk in the rolling Emmental hills. In 1764 the cheese exporting company Pionierbauern Sommer was founded in the municipality. It remained in business for over a century before closing in 1869. A cheese co-op opened in 1844 to support the local dairy farmers. In the early 20th century the municipality remained fairly isolated and cheese producers and exporters began to leave for other communities. Today about one-third of the jobs in Affoltern are in agriculture with the rest being in small manufacturers and service companies. In 1990 a dairy center with a cheese making demonstrations opened.

Bates worked to promote East Boston, securing legislative approval of the first tunnel under Boston Harbor, joining the neighborhood to the rest of the city. From 1903 to 1905, he served as Governor of Massachusetts, upsetting the Republican establishment with his organizing tactics and alienating his own supporters with some of his conservative executive actions and proposals. Later in life, he served as chair of the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1917‚Äì1918. Early life and education John Bates was born in North Easton, Massachusetts to Rev. Lewis Benton Bates, an itinerant Methodist minister, and Louisa D. (Field) Bates. He attended public school in New Bedford, Chelsea, Taunton, and eventually the Boston Latin School. He earned an A.B. from the Methodist- affiliated Boston University in 1882 and a J.D. in 1885. Over the next decade Bates practiced law in Boston, residing in its East Boston neighborhood.  Early political career  = Boston Common Council = Bates, a Republican, first served on Boston's Common Council representing. During this period, Bates built a ward-based political machine largely independent of the existing party infrastructure.Abrams, p. 95 Beginning in 1891, Bates began promoting connections between East Boston and the rest of the city (separated by the inner Boston Harbor). Early proposals for a bridge went nowhere, and Bates instead began working on a tunnel proposal. The proposal met opposition from Boston's leadership over its construction costs. Bates convinced Mayor Josiah Quincy to accept a toll of one cent per rider, securing agreement for its construction. = Speaker of the Massachusetts House = Bates won election to represent East Boston in the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1893 and served until 1899. From 1897 to 1899, Bates was Speaker of the House. He was elected Speaker with the support of his independent machine, without party support. =Lieutenant Governor= In 1899, Bates again bucked the Republican party establishment by defeating the expected nominee, Curtis Guild Jr., for the party nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts. Bates was not highly thought of by the more Brahmin elements of the party establishment, but it ultimately supported his runs for lieutenant governor and governor. Governor Murray Crane, under whom Bates served, believed that some of the opposition to Bates was based \\"on the profound idea of a certain element... 'that he was not our kind'\\".Abrams, p. 96  Governor of Massachusetts  In 1902, Bates was elected the 41st Governor, despite a significant crossover of Republicans to his Democratic opponent, William A. Gaston. During his first term, Bates stepped up enforcement of strict liquor control laws. He also generated controversy by disregarding supporters' requests and catering to the more exclusive elements of the party establishment. However, these elements only supported Bates out of party duty and were also upset by the appointment of one of his East Boston cronies as Boston police commissioner.Abrams, pp. 100-103 Despite losing support from factions in his own party, Bates won reelection in 1903. His second term deepened these divisions. He proposed further amendments to Sunday entertainment laws and angered agricultural interests with a proposal for reorganizing grading and inspection of farms. He vetoed a Republican bill limiting the working hours of women and children, earning him the opposition of labor interests. He also angered veterans groups by vetoing a bill granting a gratuity to the state's surviving American Civil War veterans, which the legislature successfully overrode.Abrams, pp. 103-105 In 1904, the long-planned tunnel to East Harbor was opened. In the 1904 election, Democrats nominated Brockton businessman William L. Douglas, who had nationwide name and facial recognition because his image was stamped on the shoes he sold. Douglas, who was on good terms with labor interests, financed the Democratic campaign and won a landslide victory over Bates.Abrams, pp. 105-107 Later career Bates then retired to his private law practice in Boston, largely withdrawing from political life. He was offered the possibility of standing for Vice President of the United States in 1912, but refused. From 1917 to 1919, he presided over the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention, which enacted a number of changes to the state constitution. During World War II, he served on the state's Public Safety Commission.  Personal life  Bates married Clara Elizabeth Smith on July 12, 1887. Bates was an active member of the Freemasons and the International Order of Odd Fellows. He was awarded an honorary law degree by Wesleyan University in 1903. He retired from his law practice in 1931, and died at his home in Allston in 1946. He was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in Everett.

The National University of San Marcos's 450th anniversary seal. The same elements were used for the third generation seal in early 2000; it added a red background and golden frame for the number 450. The 1574 version of the original University seal: Saint Mark writing at a desk, a lion, three crowns, and the Latin phrase \\"Plus ultra\\". The third logo added light computer-generated imagery effects; the RGB color model was used and golden effects were added for seal's frame and shade in background. Since its founding in the 1550s, the National University of San Marcos' identifying symbols changed over the years, although the main pattern has been consistently maintained. First logo From its founding until 1574, the university's first official seal featured an icon of the \\"Virgen del Rosario\\" (Virgin of the Rosary), patron saint of the Dominican friars; at the right was a representation of the Pacific Ocean and on the bottom a lime (fruit) (that is, the fruit, which in Spanish is una lima, hence Lima, Peru). The logo was approved by King Charles I of Spain in 1551. By the late 1570s and after a papal bull of Pope Pius V, the seal was modified, replacing the icon of Virgen del Rosario with Saint Mark. It is uncertain which colors were used on this seal, because documents in the 16th century were only black-and- white paper prints. It was not until 1929 when the colorsblue for the ocean, black or brown for the saint's icon, a light blue background, and silver for columnsbecame popular. This logo was the longest-enduring symbol of the university: it was used for almost four and a half centuries, until the late 1980s, when it was improved for the second generation logo. Second logo The first logo was revised and lightly improved in the early 1990s, and it was fully improved on May 12, 1991, when university celebrated its 440th anniversary. Major changes were made to the angel's shape and its wings, but the main pattern remained unchanged. This logo gained quickly popularity, hence it survived all the decade. This seal featured the same colors as were used since late 1920s, but the black-and-white version is known by almost all graduate students of those days. This seal was improved for the third generation logo in early 2000s. Third logo The third generation logo used today was released in early 2000s. It became official on May 12, 2001, when the university celebrated its 450th anniversary; at the same time a special logo was made for this year, which was used throughout 2001 and 2002. Since it was introduced in early 2000 this logo has been the university's official symbol, and is widely used on media advertisements.

Emphasis is placed on using the AIM-54 Phoenix missile as a standoff weapon where possible, rather than engaging the more nimble Soviet fighters in close- quarters dogfighting. Wingmen formations and support aircraft can also be controlled; unlike previous MicroProse simulations, as Computer Gaming World reported in 1994, \\"No longer do you alone, armed with a single aircraft and eight missiles, engage the entire third world\\".

Opening in 1942 during the German occupation of France, it follows the fortunes of a small theatre in the Montmartre area of Paris which keeps up passive resistance by maintaining its cultural integrity, despite censorship, antisemitism and material shortages, to emerge triumphant at the war's end. The title evokes two salient facts of city life under the Germans: fuel shortages led people to spend their evenings in theatres and other places of entertainment, but the curfew meant they had to catch the last M√©tro train home. In 1981, the film won 10 C√©sars for: best film, best actor (Depardieu), best actress (Deneuve), best cinematography, best director (Truffaut), best editing, best music, best production design, best sound and best writing. It received Best Foreign Film nominations in the Academy Awards and Golden Globe Awards. The Last Metro was one of Truffaut's more successful productions, grossing $3,007,436 in the United States; this was also true in France, where it had 3,384,045 admissions, making it one of his more successful films in his native country. Plot On his way to start rehearsals at the Th√©√¢tre Montmartre, where he has been hired as male lead for a new production, young Bernard Granger tries to talk to an attractive woman, who repeatedly rebuffs him. When he arrives, she turns out to be the costume designer Arlette, a lesbian. He is taken to see the icily beautiful Marion, who is both owner of the theatre and leading lady. Her Jewish husband, Lucas, is believed to have left Paris but is in fact living in the cellar, where Marion visits him each evening to bring books and food and to talk about the new production. However, Marion is quite struck by Bernard, whom Lucas can just hear through a heating vent but never see. Unknown to anybody at the theatre, Bernard is a member of a Resistance group and delivers the bomb that kills a German admiral. The first night is loved by a full house but one of the newspaper reviews next morning is viciously hostile, damning the show as Jewish. The writer, Daxiat, an anti-semite, hopes to oust Marion and take over her theatre. While cast and crew are celebrating their success in a nightclub, Daxiat is also there with another party. Bernard, furious that the man has insulted the gentile Marion, hustles him out to the street and pushes him around. Furious that Bernard has jeopardised her theatre, Marion refuses all contact with him offstage. One night, pretending to be air raid wardens, two Gestapo men start searching the theatre and it is Bernard to whom Marion turns in desperation for urgent help in concealing Lucas and his effects. When the Gestapo arrest Bernard's Resistance contact just before they have planned to meet in a church, he decides to devote his life to the cause and give up acting. As he is clearing out his little dressing room, Marion comes in to say goodbye and the two make love on the floor. After the war, Bernard returns to be male lead in a new play that the freed Lucas wrote while hiding. In it, the female lead played by Marion offers to share her life but he claims he never really loved her.

Production Truffaut had wanted to create a film set during the French occupation period for a long time, as his uncle and grandfather were both part of the French Resistance, and were once caught while passing messages. This event was eventually recreated in The Last Metro. Truffaut was inspired by the actor Jean Marais‚Äôs autobiography, basing the film on this and other documents by theatre people from during the occupation. This film was one installment - dealing with theatre - of a trilogy on the entertainment world envisaged by Truffaut. The installment that dealt with the film world was 1973's La Nuit Am√©ricaine (Day for Night), which had won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Truffaut completed the screenplay for the third installment, L'Agence Magique, which would have dealt with the world of music hall. In the late 1970s, he was close to beginning filming, but the failure of his film The Green Room forced him to look to a more commercial project, and he filmed Love on the Run instead. Truffaut began casting in September 1979, and wrote the role of Marion especially with Catherine Deneuve in mind, for her energy. G√©rard Depardieu initially did not want to be involved in the film, as he did not like Truffaut‚Äôs directing style, but he was subsequently convinced that he should take part. Most of the filming took place in an abandoned chocolate factory on Rue du Landy in Clichy, which was converted into a studio. During shooting Deneuve suffered an ankle sprain from a fall, resulting in having to shoot scenes at short notice. Scriptwriter Suzanne Schiffman was also hospitalised with a serious intestinal obstruction. The film shoot lasted fifty-nine days and ended on 21 April 1980. Themes A recurring theme in Truffaut‚Äôs films has been linking film making and film watching. The Last Metro is self- conscious in this respect. In the opening the film mixes documentary footage with period re-creations alongside shots of contemporary film posters. Truffaut commented ‚Äúthis film is not concerned merely with anti-semitism but intolerance in general‚Äù and a tolerance is shown through the characters of Jean Poiret playing a homosexual director and Andrea Ferreol plays a lesbian designer. As in Truffaut's earlier films Jules et Jim and Two English Girls, there is a love triangle between the three principal characters: Marion Steiner (Deneuve), her husband Lucas (Heinz Bennent) and Bernard Granger (Depardieu), an actor in the theatre's latest production.

It was distributed worldwide by RCTV International. Daniela Alvarado and Ricardo √Ålamo star as the protagonists, while Roxana D√≠az, Norkys Batista and Eduardo Serrano play the antagonists. In the United States, a loose adaptation of the telenovela titled Jane the Virgin premiered on The CW. It is produced by Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Distribution. Synopsis Sixteen-year-old Juana Perez (Daniela Alvarado) is a bright student with a scholarship to study journalism in the United States. However, she gets pregnant by artificial insemination due to a hospital error when she goes for a checkup. The father of the baby is discovered to be Mauricio de la Vega (Ricardo √Ålamo), the owner of a fashion magazine called Positivo. Years ago, Mauricio suffered from a chronic illness and after recovering, he had his semen stored in order to fulfil his dreams of having a child with his wife Carlota Vivas (Roxana D√≠az). After learning of the hospital error, Mauricio tries to find the girl who could possibly be carrying his child and his only hope of becoming a father. When her pregnancy is discovered and causes a scandal, Juana leaves school and finds a job as a photographer at Positivo. She begins to get close to Mauricio while working there, and he also begins to fall in love with her, especially after discovering she is the mother of his child. But Carlota's growing envy of not being able to give Mauricio a child and the possibility the woman carrying his child will take him away from her leads her to do everything possible to keep Mauricio and Juana separated. Francisco Rojas (Saul Marin), Mauricio's business partner, disappears during Positivo magazine's party, leaving his wife Desir√©e alone and penniless, even though they had an unstable marriage before. Rogelio Vivas, Carlota's father who also owns shares in Positivo is secretly planning to take over the business from Mauricio and frame him for the death of Francisco. He also becomes attracted to Desir√©e and tries to get close to her, much to the anger of his wife Amparo. Meanwhile, Desir√©e who is friends with Carlota stays at her house, and she also becomes infatuated with Mauricio and tries to make him fall in love with her.

Zirconium fluoride in a mixture with other fluorides is a coolant for molten salt reactors. In the mixture with sodium fluoride it is a candidate coolant for the Advanced High-Temperature Reactor. Together with uranium salt, zirconium fluoride can be a component of fuel- coolant in molten salt reactors. Mixture of sodium fluoride, zirconium fluoride, and uranium tetrafluoride (53-41-6 mol.%) was used as a coolant in the Aircraft Reactor Experiment.

On 31 August 1915 he was promoted to first lieutenant. On 3 February 1916 Gayibov was sent to the Western Front and attached to the squadron of airships. On 21 May he was assigned as artillery officer of \\"Ilya Muromets ‚Ññ 16\\" airship, which had been built by I.I. Sikorsky in Saint Petersburg, a Russo-Balt factory. On the eve of the war, Russia had the largest air fleet among the belligerents: 244 airplanes in 39 squadrons. By the beginning of the hostilities, there were 221 pilots, 170 officers, 35 lower rank officers and 16 volunteers in the Russian air fleet. The logistics of the beginning of the war proved to be inefficient with petrol, castor oil, spares, tents and other aviation supplies. Airplanes routinely wrecked in the dry field circumstances, especially with bad weather, when there was scarcity of tents and moveable hangars, usage of areas of little avail for airdromes. After the first months of the war, many squadrons had to be taken back to home to be supplied with new equipment and retrained. Gayibov was in combat fights on board the \\"Ilya Muromets ‚Ññ 16\\" airship, and raided enemy positions. Last Flight On 12 September 1916 a raid was conducted under the command of colonel Brant's General Staff, with an air squadron of two airplanes including the \\"Ilya Muromets\\", and 13 instruments. The aim of the raid was Borun, 12 versts from the enemy front line, and a nearest district, where, according to reports, the staff of a German division was based, at the junction of a narrow gauge railway, together with artillery and quartermaster's storehouses and airdrome. Farrukh's squadron penetrated into Krevo and dropped 100-pound bombs, forcing the enemy to retreat. Six days later, on 18 September 1916, The Petrogradskiye Izvestiya newspaper wrote: \\"General headquarters report that our airplanes invaded the enemy's rear in the Western front in Borun-Krevo district. Various posts were exploded by accurate bomb attacks, storehouses of the enemy were set on fire. Transportation facilities, railway stations and automobiles were also destroyed. Farrukh agha Gayibov and his team entered the battle with the enemy and destroyed four German airplanes. After destroying two Albatros airplanes, they fell into enemy's territory and perished\\". Awards On 8 November 1915 Farrukh agha Gaibov was awarded the Third Class Order of Saint Stanislaus with swords and bow, and on 14 December, the Fourth Class Order of St. Anna with the \\"For Bravery\\" legend on it. In 1916, he was awarded the Second Class Order of Saint Stanislaus with swords. On 26 January 1917 F. Gayibov was awarded the Second Class Order of St. Anna with swords (posthumously). On 14 March he was awarded the Third Class Order of St. Anna. On 25 March, as a lieutenant of 39th artillery brigade who died in air battle with his enemy, Farrukh agha Gayibov was posthumously awarded the Fourth Class Order of St. George. Memory of the hero By tradition of pilots, a note had been thrown down from a German airplane and it is reported that Germans buried the crew of the airplane with military honours. Recently, the cemetery of the fallen airplane crew was found in a German cemetery in Borun village. Apparently, Russian pilots were reburied in this cemetery in the 1930s, when the Polish government provided German military burials, with the participation Germans. These words were written on gravestone cross in Polish: ¬´4 NIEZNANYCH ROS.LOTN.25.16¬ª, which means: \\"4 unknown Russian pilots were buried 25.16\\". The date was written according to the European calendar. The month of burial was missing in the inscription, but it wasn't written on other gravestone crosses, either.

For example, it may predict greater parental investment in males by parents in \\"good conditions\\" and greater investment in females by parents in \\"poor conditions\\" (relative to parents in good condition). The reasoning for this prediction is as follows: Assume that parents have information on the sex of their offspring and can influence their survival differentially. While pressures exist to maintain sex ratios at 50%, evolution will favor local deviations from this if one sex has a likely greater reproductive payoff than is usual. Trivers and Willard also identified a circumstance in which reproducing individuals might experience deviations from expected offspring reproductive valuenamely, varying maternal condition. In polygynous species males may mate with multiple females and low- condition males will achieve fewer or no matings. Parents in relatively good condition would then be under selection for mutations causing production and investment in sons (rather than daughters), because of the increased chance of mating experienced by these good-condition sons. Mating with multiple females conveys a large reproductive benefit, whereas daughters could translate their condition into only smaller benefits. An opposite prediction holds for poor- condition parents‚Äîselection will favor production and investment in daughters, so long as daughters are likely to be mated, while sons in poor condition are likely to be out-competed by other males and end up with zero mates (i.e., those sons will be a reproductive dead end). The hypothesis was used to explain why, for example, Red Deer mothers would produce more sons when they are in good condition, and more daughters when in poor condition. In polyandrous species where some females mate with multiple males (and others get no matings) and males mate with one/few females (i.e., \\"sex-role reversed\\" species), these predictions from the Trivers‚ÄìWillard hypothesis are reversed: parents in good condition will invest in daughters in order to have a daughter that can out-compete other females to attract multiple males, whereas parents in poor condition will avoid investing in daughters who are likely to get out- competed and will instead invest in sons in order to gain at least some grandchildren. \\"Condition\\" can be assessed in multiple ways, including body size, parasite loads, or dominance, which has also been shown in macaques (Macaca sylvanus) to affect the sex of offspring, with dominant females giving birth to more sons and non-dominant females giving birth to more daughters. Consequently, high-ranking females give birth to a higher proportion of males than those who are low-ranking. In their original paper, Trivers and Willard were not yet aware of the biochemical mechanism for the occurrence of biased sex ratios. Eventually, however, Melissa Larson et al. (2001) proposed that a high level of circulating glucose in the mother's bloodstream may favor the survival of male blastocysts. This conclusion is based on the observed male- skewed survival rates (to expanded blastocyst stages) when bovine blastocysts were exposed to heightened levels of glucose. As blood glucose levels are highly correlated with access to high-quality food, blood glucose level may serve as a proxy for \\"maternal condition\\". Thus, heightened glucose functions as one possible biochemical mechanism for observed Trivers‚ÄìWillard effects. Wild and West published a paper describing a mathematical model built on the Trivers‚ÄìWillard hypothesis that allows precise predictions of alterations in sex-ratio under different circumstances.  Humans  The Trivers‚ÄìWillard hypothesis has been applied to resource differences among individuals in a society as well as to resource differences among societies. Empirical evidence is mixed with higher support in better studies according to Cronk in a 2007 review. One example, in a 1997 study, of a group with a preference for females was Romani in Hungary, a low-status group. They \\"had a female-biased sex ratio at birth, were more likely to abort a child after having had one or more daughters, nursed their daughters longer, and sent their daughters to school for longer\\".

It is the substrate of luciferase (EC 1.13.12.7), which is responsible for the characteristic yellow light emission from many firefly species. As with all other luciferins, oxygen is required to elicit light; however, it has also been found adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and magnesium are required for light emission. History Much of the early work on the chemistry of the firefly luminescence was done in the lab of William D. McElroy at Johns Hopkins University. The luciferin was first isolated and purified in 1949, though it would be several years until a procedure was developed to crystallize the compound in high yield. This, along with the synthesis and structure elucidation, was accomplished by Dr. Emil H. White at the Johns Hopkins University, Department of Chemistry. The procedure was an acid-base extraction, given the carboxylic acid group on the luciferin. The luciferin could be effectively extracted using ethyl acetate at low pH from powder of approximately 15,000 firefly lanterns. The structure was later confirmed by combined use of infrared spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy and synthetic methods to degrade the compound into identifiable fragments. Properties Crystal luciferin was found to be fluorescent, absorbing ultraviolet light with a peak at 327 nm and emitting light with a peak at 530 nm. Visible emission occurs upon relaxation of the oxyluciferin from a singlet excited state down to its ground state. Alkaline solutions caused a redshift of the absorption likely due to deprotonation of the hydroxyl group on the benzothiazole, but did not affect the fluorescence emission. It was found that the luciferyl adenylate (the AMP ester of luciferin) spontaneously emits light in solution. Different species of fireflies all use the same luciferin, however the color of the light emitted can differ greatly. The light from Photuris pennsylvanica was measured to be 552 nm (green-yellow) while Pyrophorus plagiophthalamus was measured to emit light at 582 nm (orange) in the ventral organ. Such differences are likely due to pH changes or differences in primary structure of the luciferase. Modification of the firefly luciferin substrate has led to \\"red-shifted\\" emissions (up to emission wavelength of 675 nm). Biological activity The in vivo synthesis of firefly luciferin is not completely understood. Only the final step of the enzymatic pathway has been studied, which is the condensation reaction of D-cysteine with 2-cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole, and is the same reaction used to produce the compound synthetically. This was confirmed by radiolabeling of atoms in the two compounds and by identification of a luciferin-regenerating enzyme. In firefly, oxidation of luciferins, which is catalyzed by luciferases, yields a peroxy compound 1,2-dioxetane. The dioxetane is unstable and decays spontaneously to carbon dioxide and excited ketones, which release excess energy by emitting light (bioluminescence).Aldo Roda Chemiluminescence and Bioluminescence: Past, Present and Future, p. 57, Royal Society of Chemistry, 2010, centerFirefly luciferin and modified substrates are fatty acid mimics and have been used to localize fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in vivo.

Early Life and Ancestral History  Information detailing the early life of Robert Strawbridge is somewhat limited. One article, Robert Strawbridge, offers some light unto the subject. Another source, Robert Strawbridge: Some Additional Irish Perspectives offers additional details. In the year 1732, Robert Strawbridge was born in a small farming town in the county of Leitrim, Ireland. The town of Gortconnellan, Drumsna situates on a ridge. The town's name literally means ‚Äúthe ridge over the swimming place.‚Äù It is here along the south-eastern flow of the majestic River Shannon, makes a series of turns which create a perfect loop before regaining its original course. The result of the back-tracking waterway is a protected area blessed with the country's most fertile and wooded lands. It is these abundant lands which Robert grows up. The farm with a privileged view of the river will house Robert until his 24th birthday. Crimmins (1905) calls him a native of the nearby Carrick on Shannon, County Leitrim. The land which the Strawbridge family lives on is a gift to an ancestor one-hundred and fifty years before, when the English King James transplanted English families in the hopes of gaining strategic lands along the bountiful River Shannon. To the Catholic citizens of Ireland, this transplanting of Englishmen by the Anglican King was tantamount to military and religious conquest. Despite the native opposition, the transplanting occurs, creating a line of natural-resource- abundant towns along the Shannon. The town of Drumsna is one of these new settlements. Robert's Anglican household, in a gesture to disgruntled Irish neighbors, names him after his maternal grandfather. According to JR Wesley Weir in his article, Robert Strawbridge: Some Additional Irish Perspectives, ‚Äúthe long-held Irish tradition is to name the oldest son after the paternal grandfather and the next son after the maternal grandfather.‚Äù From this, it is easy to surmise that Robert is the second son born to his parents. Gaining the benefits of a proper education, Robert easily improves to a bright young man, eloquent in speech, intelligent and from a somewhat affluent family. Robert is also a physically strong fellow, his trade as a carpenter embellishing his sturdy frame which tops out at just less than 6‚Äô tall. The man with shoulder length hair that frames brilliant eyes and a handsome face has a winsome and gentle smile that warms the hearts of many, notwithstanding one particular young lady he eventually marries. For Robert in the summer of 1758, the warmer months marked a two-year spiritual journey. Since 1756, when he experienced his Christian conversion, Robert went on a preaching tour. His conversion experience was unconventional, mentored by one brought up in a traditional Irish-Catholic family. The unlikely mentor was Laurence Coughlan. Coughlan's family is more in line with the traditional Irishmen of the 18th century, real Hibernians. He too was born in Drumsna, but unlike Robert Strawbridge, Coughlan did not experience the benefits of education like Robert. Despite this limited beginning, Coughlan finds himself drawn and changed by the words of the Bible. His exposure to the sacred texts comes by through the efforts of John Wesley's itinerants in the year 1753. His birth anew moves him to vigorously gain knowledge of the word. These efforts create a deep urge for him to preach to the inhabitants of Drumsna. John Wesley, hearing of the young man's efforts recruits him just two years later. Another twelve months later and Coughlan departs Ireland of his own doing to preach to the fishermen of Newfoundland. Before Coughlan departs for Newfoundland, his early preaching efforts in Drumsna convert the younger brother of Robert Strawbridge, Leonard. The transformation of the younger brother also influences Robert Strawbridge. Upon his conversion, Robert's ‚Äúall in‚Äù approach to life leads him to abandon his trade and begin preaching. It isn't long before his independent spirit invites opposition. His Anglican experience, much like Coughlan's Catholic experience, inspires Robert to alienate himself from the institutionalized religion of the Anglican Church. The first signs of trouble occur only months after his initial efforts to preach. The controversy arises by his efforts to go against John Wesley's admonition that no Methodist preachers are to distribute the sacraments without being ordained by the Anglican Church. Wesley was not seeking a separation from the Anglican Church. He did all he could to instill confidence that his Methodist efforts were mainly a revival movement within the Anglican Church. In Ireland, the independent spirit of several of the early Irish Methodist preachers thought otherwise. Robert's zeal for reaching the lost souls of Leitrim County led him to go against John Wesley's rules and distribute communion and baptize new converts. Robert was determined to bring the entire Christian experience to each person he met. This distribution of the sacraments by the Irish preachers was not a new thing beginning with Robert Strawbridge. Years before, many of the new preachers in Ireland had themselves licensed under the Toleration Act of 1689. This provision from the English King inspired men like Thomas Walsh and the brothers Charles and Edward Perronet to on their own, distributing the Lord's Supper and Baptism. Despite those who preceded Robert, the Anglican and Wesleyan faithful in Drumsna ask him to leave only a few months after his initial efforts. Unshaken by this, Robert gathers his horse and heads out on a preaching tour. His stops in the neighboring counties of Sligo and Kilmore, eventually end in the County of Armagh, specifically the town of Terryhoogan. In Terryhoogan he meet his future wife. They marry shortly before 1760. Also in 1760, Robert and his wife consider as many other young Irish couples; they contemplate leaving Ireland for America.  In America  A member of the single Protestant family in the area, he moved first to Sligo, then emigrated to Frederick County, Maryland between 1760 and 1766. He began preaching in Maryland soon after his arrival, making him the pioneer of Methodism on the American continent. According to the 1801 Journal of Bishop Francis Asbury, Strawbridge founded \\"the first class (of Methodism) in Maryland and America\\" in 1768 at his log cabin near New Windsor. Little is known about Strawbridge's wife, Elizabeth Piper, although Strawbridge began his preaching tours soon after completing their log dwelling leaving wife and children on their rented farm at Pipe Creek. Preaching in his log cabin home and quickly organizing Methodist societies in the area, he helped establish the very earliest Methodist societies in North America. During these early years, Strawbridge also built log meeting houses at Sam's Creek and Bush near Aberdeen. He soon began travelling and preaching in Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, establishing a number of societies. He was very popular and had a major influence on many young preachers. At the first recorded Quarterly Conference in Joppa in December 1772, Bishop Asbury formally appointed Robert Strawbridge and Richard Owings to the Frederick County circuit. Most likely always a layperson, he was criticized for administering the sacraments. The 1773 conference of Methodist preachers in America prohibited such preachers from such rites, except Strawbridge, and only then at the direction of Bishop Francis Asbury, who had been sent to the colonies by John Wesley to oversee the faith. Strawbridge was known to have continued even without Asbury. Both New York and Maryland claimed the birthplace of American Methodism, in a dispute lasting more than 150 years. At the 1860 Baltimore Conference, Maryland was outvoted and the Centennial of American Methodism was celebrated in 1866, the year Methodism was founded in New York. However, it was later discovered that a Methodist minister in Ohio in 1813 had met a German farmer who claimed to have been converted by Strawbridge in Maryland in 1763. This evidence figured in a 1916 church decision that the origin of American Methodism was in Maryland, not New York. The Strawbridge Shrine, in Carroll County, Maryland at the edge of New Windsor, is named after Robert Strawbridge and is dedicated to preserve the history of his ministry.

Some anti-cancer medications and dyes are triazenes. Formally, triazenes are related to the unstable triazene, H2N‚àíN=NH. The relationship is more theoretical than practical. Production Dacarbazine is a triazene used in the treatment of melanoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Bis-triazene analogue of Tr√∂ger's base Triazenes are prepared from the N-coupling reaction between diazonium salts and primary or secondary amines. Symmetrical triazenes, for example 1,3-diphenyltriazene (PhN=N‚àíNHPh), are prepared by the partial diazotization of aromatic primary amines, aniline in this example, and the subsequent coupling reaction in the presence of sodium acetate. Asymmetrical triazenes, for example (phenyldiazenyl)pyrrolidine (PhN=N‚àíNC4H8), are prepared from the N-coupling reaction between diazonium salts and secondary amines in presence of sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate. Bis-triazene carrying analogues of Tr√∂ger's base have been obtained similarly. :Production of symmetrical (top) and asymmetrical (bottom) triazenes  Tautomerism Triazenes derived from primary amines engage in tautomerization. Triazenes derived from primary amines engage in tautomerism. In the case of 1,3-diphenyltriazine, the tautomers are identical. Reactions and applications An important reaction of triazenes is their conversion to diazonium salts. Triazenes decompose in the presence of protonating or alkylating agents into quaternary amines and diazonium salts; as such triazenes have been used as an in situ source of diazonium that reacted with sodium sulfide to give the corresponding thiophenols. A strategy for the protection and deprotection of sensitive secondary amines is based on this principle. Triazenes used in the synthesis of thiophenols Polymeric triazenes are applied as conductive and absorbent materials. Triazenes have been used in the synthesis of cinnoline, functionalized lactams, and coumarins.

Its population was 1,779 as of the Canada 2016 Census. Unlike most other northern villages in Nunavik, it has no Inuit reserved land of the same name associated with it. The name means \\"Place where there is a smell of rotten meat\\". This unusual name may have originated from either one of these events (occurring a long time ago): *A herd of caribou was swept away by the Povungnituk River while attempting to cross it and washed ashore near the current village site where the decomposing bodies began giving off a staunch smell. *An epidemic killed off most of the area's residents to the point where there were not enough people to bury the dead, allowing the exposed bodies to decompose, giving off a putrid smell. Puvirnituq is the aviation hub of the Hudson Bay coast. Puvirnituq Airport handles scheduled flights to and from all other Hudson Bay coastal communities in Quebec, Montreal, and Ottawa. It is not accessible by road. The police services in Puvirnituq are provided by the Kativik Regional Police Force. History In 1921, the Hudson's Bay Company established a trading post here, known as Povungnituk and often shortened to Pov. This attracted the settlement of Inuit living in the region. In 1951, the HBC opened a general store. The closure of HBC stores in other nearby villages led to an influx of Inuit to Puvirnituq. A Catholic mission was founded in 1956, which encouraged the residents to form the Carvers Association of Povungnituk two years later. It later became the Co-operative Association of Povungnituk and was instrumental in assisting, developing, and marketing Inuit art. Its success inspired other Inuit communities to form similar cooperatives, most of which now make up the Federation of Co-operatives of Northern Quebec. Leah Nuvalinga Qumaluk was among the artists who worked at the cooperative.

The origin of the coordinate system has been chosen such that : \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\\\mathbf{r}^{(i)} = 0 i.e. in the system of the center of mass r_{CM}. Where : r_{CM}=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\\\mathbf{r}^{(i)} Another definition, which is mathematically identical but gives an alternative calculation method, is: : S_{mn} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{2N^{2}}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\\\sum_{j=1}^{N} (r_{m}^{(i)} - r_{m}^{(j)}) (r_{n}^{(i)} - r_{n}^{(j)}) Therefore, the x-y component of the gyration tensor for particles in Cartesian coordinates would be: : S_{xy} = \\\\frac{1}{2N^{2}}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\\\sum_{j=1}^{N} (x_{i} - x_{j}) (y_{i} - y_{j}) In the continuum limit, : S_{mn} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\dfrac{\\\\int d\\\\mathbf{r} \\\\ \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\ r_{m} r_{n}}{\\\\int d\\\\mathbf{r} \\\\ \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r})} where \\\\rho(\\\\mathbf{r}) represents the number density of particles at position \\\\mathbf{r}. Although they have different units, the gyration tensor is related to the moment of inertia tensor. The key difference is that the particle positions are weighted by mass in the inertia tensor, whereas the gyration tensor depends only on the particle positions; mass plays no role in defining the gyration tensor. Diagonalization Since the gyration tensor is a symmetric 3x3 matrix, a Cartesian coordinate system can be found in which it is diagonal : \\\\mathbf{S} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\lambda_{x}^{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\lambda_{y}^{2} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\lambda_{z}^{2} \\\\end{bmatrix} where the axes are chosen such that the diagonal elements are ordered \\\\lambda_{x}^{2} \\\\leq \\\\lambda_{y}^{2} \\\\leq \\\\lambda_{z}^{2}. These diagonal elements are called the principal moments of the gyration tensor. Shape descriptors The principal moments can be combined to give several parameters that describe the distribution of particles. The squared radius of gyration is the sum of the principal moments : R_{g}^{2} = \\\\lambda_{x}^{2} + \\\\lambda_{y}^{2} + \\\\lambda_{z}^{2} The asphericity b is defined by : b \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\lambda_{z}^{2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\lambda_{x}^{2} + \\\\lambda_{y}^{2} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\lambda_{z}^{2} - \\\\frac{R_{g}^{2}}{2} which is always non-negative and zero only when the three principal moments are equal, Œªx = Œªy = Œªz. This zero condition is met when the distribution of particles is spherically symmetric (hence the name asphericity) but also whenever the particle distribution is symmetric with respect to the three coordinate axes, e.g., when the particles are distributed uniformly on a cube, tetrahedron or other Platonic solid. Similarly, the acylindricity c is defined by : c \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\lambda_{y}^{2} - \\\\lambda_{x}^{2} which is always non-negative and zero only when the two principal moments are equal, Œªx = Œªy. This zero condition is met when the distribution of particles is cylindrically symmetric (hence the name, acylindricity), but also whenever the particle distribution is symmetric with respect to the two coordinate axes, e.g., when the particles are distributed uniformly on a regular prism. Finally, the relative shape anisotropy \\\\kappa^{2} is defined : \\\\kappa^{2} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\frac{b^{2} + (3/4) c^{2}}{R_{g}^{4}} = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{x}^{4}+\\\\lambda_{y}^{4}+\\\\lambda_{z}^{4}}{(\\\\lambda_{x}^{2}+\\\\lambda_{y}^{2}+\\\\lambda_{z}^{2})^{2}} - \\\\frac{1}{2} which is bounded between zero and one. \\\\kappa^{2} = 0 only occurs if all points are spherically symmetric, and \\\\kappa^{2} = 1 only occurs if all points lie on a line.

It was established as one of the reforms during the Progressive Era and became a federal policy in 1921 under the Woodrow Wilson Administration. The process of creating the executive budget consists of three phases. The first stage is the development of the president's budget. In this stage, the president submits a comprehensive budget to the United States Congress that covers the full range of federal activities. Next, the budget proposal is edited and revised by Congress. Last, the budget is finalized and executed. It is then given a budget bill from the legislature. The legislature composes the budget bill while an executive agency implements the bill by choosing which projects to take on within the limitations imposed. History One of the reforms of the Progressive Era in the United States was the executive budget system which had its first application for municipal government. The federal government conducted an important study of the executive budget system during the administration of President William Howard Taft (See Sec. VI: The Taft Commission's Federal Budget Study, pp. 26‚Äì31). The executive budget system was adapted from the longstanding British parliamentary practice that forbade the House of Commons to increase requests for supply (appropriations) from the governing ministry (prime minister and cabinet) without the approval of the responsible government minister (cabinet member.)(See Sec. VI: Taft) It became federal policy in 1921 based on actions of the Wilson Administration that were enacted during the administration of Warren G. Harding. Process The executive budget process consists of three main phases: development of the president's budget, interaction with congress, and execution of the budget. =Development of the president's budget= The legal framework established by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 requires the president to annually submit a comprehensive budget to Congress that covers the full range of federal activities. Current law requires the president to submit his budget proposal no later than the first Monday in February. The creation of the budget usually begins approximately 10 months before the president submits his budget to congress (about 18 months before the start of the fiscal year). During the early stages of the budget's formulation, federal agencies prepare their budget requests following their own procedures. =Interaction with congress= The president's budget does not have any legally binding effect, but rather initiates the congressional budget process and provides a statement of the budgetary goals of the president. After the president submits his budget proposal, Office of Management and Budget and other administration officials testify before the congressional committees. Individual federal agencies also justify and explain their specific budget requests at congressional hearings as budgetary legislation is formulated. Agencies submit extensive written justifications, usually focusing on the proposed increase or decrease in spending, to the responsible appropriations subcommittees of each chamber. The Office of Management and Budget ensures that agency budget justifications, testimony, and other submissions are consistent with the president's policies by requiring agencies to clear any material through The Office of Management and Budget before providing it to Congress. The president is required to submit a mid-session review by July 15 of each year. This budget update must reflect changes in economic conditions, any legislative actions taken by Congress, and other factors affecting the president's initial budget submission. =Execution of the budget= Once appropriation acts and any other budgetary legislation, such as revenue or reconciliation measures, become law, they are executed by the appropriate federal agencies. However, funds provided in statutes are not automatically available to agencies for obligation. Appropriated funds first must be apportioned by fiscal quarter or by activity as appropriate. The Office of Management and Budget is responsible for reviewing apportionment requests and making funds available to agencies. Projects The legislature proposes a budget bill for the executive agency that includes a cap on total spending and earmarked allocations to designated public projects. Each of these projects offers benefits to an interest group. In deciding which project to fund, the executive agency is able to observe the productivity of each of the projects before their decision. Earmarks occur when the executive serves a wide variety of interests, and a cap on spending occurs when the executive's constituency is not as broad as that of the powerful legislators. There is a separation of power between the legislative and executive branches of the government. The legislature composes the budget bill, which may or may not include a cap on total spending and earmarked allocations to designated projects, while an executive agency implements the bill by choosing which projects to take on within the limitations imposed by the law.

It is a white solid that is used mainly for electroplating zinc but also has more specialized applications for the synthesis of organic compounds. Structure In Zn(CN)2, zinc adopts the tetrahedral coordination environment, all linked by bridging cyanide ligands. The structure consists of two \\"interpenetrating\\" structures (blue and red in the picture above). Such motifs are sometimes called \\"expanded diamondoid\\" structures. Some forms of SiO2 adopt a similar structure, wherein the tetrahedral Si centres are linked by oxides. The cyanide group shows head to tail disorder with any zinc atom having between one and four carbon neighbours, and the remaining being nitrogen atoms. It shows one of the largest negative coefficients of thermal expansion (exceeding the previous record holder, zirconium tungstate). Chemical properties Typical for an inorganic polymer, Zn(CN)2 is insoluble in most solvents. The solid dissolves in, or more precisely, is degraded by, aqueous solutions of basic ligands such as hydroxide, ammonia, and additional cyanide to give anionic complexes. Synthesis Zn(CN)2 is fairly easy to make by combining aqueous solutions of cyanide and zinc ions, for example via the double replacement reaction between KCN and ZnSO4: : ZnSO4 \\\\+ 2 KCN ‚Üí Zn(CN)2 \\\\+ K2SO4 For commercial applications, some effort is made to avoid halide impurities by using acetate salts of zinc: : Zn(CH3COO)2 \\\\+ HCN ‚Üí Zn(CN)2 \\\\+ 2 CH3COOH Zinc cyanide is also produced as a byproduct of certain gold extraction methods. Procedures to isolate gold from aqueous gold cyanide sometimes call for the addition of zinc: : 2 [Au(CN)2]‚àí \\\\+ Zn ‚Üí 2 Au + Zn(CN)2 \\\\+ 2 CN‚àí Applications =Electroplating= The main application of Zn(CN)2 is for electroplating of zinc from aqueous solutions containing additional cyanide.Ernst Gail, Stephen Gos, Rupprecht Kulzer, J√ºrgen Lor√∂sch, Andreas Rubo and Manfred Sauer \\"Cyano Compounds, Inorganic\\" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2004. =Organic synthesis= Zn(CN)2 is used to introduce the formyl group in to aromatic compounds in the Gatterman reaction where it serves a convenient, safer, and non-gaseous alternative to HCN. Because the reaction uses HCl, Zn(CN)2 also supplies the reaction in situ with ZnCl2, a Lewis acid catalyst. Examples of Zn(CN)2 being used in this way include the synthesis of 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde and mesitaldehyde. Zn(CN)2 is also employed as a catalyst for the cyanosilylation of aldehydes and ketones.

Santos School of Medicine (Escuela de Medicina Ignacio A. Santos, aka: EMIS) is the medical school division of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education (ITESM). Established in 1978 in Monterrey, Mexico. The School of Medicine was founded to satisfy the country's need for high quality medical training and innovation in biomedical research. Currently, there are approximately 500 students enrolled in the M.D. program and about 105 postgraduate students. Aside from the medical doctor program, the School of Medicine also offers a joint M.D.-Ph.D. program with Houston Methodist Hospital, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Texas A&M; Health Science Center, and other Bachelors in Nursing, Nutrition Sciences and Biomedical Engineering. The graduate medical education department offers several medical residency and fellowship programs. According to the National Association of School and Faculties of Medicine of Mexico (Asociaci√≥n Nacional de Facultades y Escuelas de Medicina, ANFEM) the school is the third best medical school in the country as of 2009. History In the mid 20th century up until the 1970s, directors of ITESM felt that academic standards were falling in the medical fields in Mexico and decided to establish their own medical school. In the 1970s, Ignacio A. Santos, an entrepreneur and philanthropist in Monterrey donated the Hospital San J√≥se (HSJ) to ITESM to establish the new program. Another reason for the establishment of the school was to provide advanced and specialized training, which before was studied by Mexican students in the United States. ITESM took over operations of the hospital along with develop the medical education program, naming it the \\"Escuela de Medicina Ignacio A. Santos \\"(EMIS) of Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey (Ignacio A. Santos Medical School) in August 1978. The first class had 27 students selected from a list of 85 applicants. Organization of the school The Medical School is part of the Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM) system which has 31 campuses in various parts of Mexico. It is the most reputable private higher education system in Mexico, with a total of 70,000 students enrolled. The medical school in Monterrey campus receives 30 students selected annually. At present, with the expansion of the school and increased academic programs in the health program was transformed into what is now the School of Medicine and Health Sciences offers the following programs, at the bachelors level, including: physician and surgeon, biomedical engineering, nursing, nutrition and wellness, health systems management, dental surgery and clinical psychology. The medical school sponsors university linked residency and fellowship programs. Currently this program offers positions in 18 fields, including anesthesiology, clinical quality improvement, general surgery, geriatrics, gynecology and obstetrics, internal medicine, ophthalmology, pediatrics, psychiatry, diagnostic radiology, cardiology, critical care medicine, neonatology, clinical neurology, pediatric neurology and urology. In addition, fellowships in selective areas are offered, including: Breast Surgery, Vascular and Interventional Radiology, Ophthalmic Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery, and Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus. The school has been accredited by the Mexican Association of Colleges and Schools of Medicine, AC (AMFEM) in November 1996, as National Accreditation System Quality Medical Education. It also is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) through the Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. Its curriculum is registered with the Ministry of Education and clinical training programs at undergraduate and graduate levels are in the Ministry of Health. Also in recent years, graduates have been ranked in the overall Aspiring National Examination for Medical Residence. Program The undergraduate medical program divides into basic medical sciences, clinical sciences and social service, emphasizing basic concepts of sciences and humanities, as well as structure and normal and abnormal function of the human body, always in a biological, psychological and social context. The method that is used in all the classes is the ABP (problem based learning), where the teacher adopts the role of tutor, working with small groups of 6-8 students. This method requires that the students define the fields of knowledge that they have to study and learn to solve health problems. This methodology seeks to develop the following skills: self learning, clinical reasoning, teamwork and self- evaluation. The first three terms correspond to the phase of basic science, which are studied mostly in Monterrey Campus. Between the 4th and the 7th semester, the phase of basic medical sciences is held at the Medical Complex Hospital San Jos√© Tec Monterrey. The third stage of the program takes place in the form of quarterly modules, from the 9th. to the 12th semester and is known as the stage of clinical sciences. Here the student already has a general perspective of what he is going to face during his professional life. Admission In Mexico the study of General Medicine is done at the undergraduate level. Those who aim to be part of EMIS are able to apply after graduating from high school with an average age between 18‚Äì20 years. The following steps are required to do so. At first is required to get an average greater than 85 in high school studies,which is a majority of A+ in almost all the subjects. After the first requirement is fulfilled the next step is to get a score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (PAA) Admission to the Institute, exceeding 1350 points. Then is needed to submit the \\"Application for admission\\" to the Admissions Department located inside the facilities of the selected campus If shortlisted the applicant will be informed via email and as next procedure he will have the teachers of EMIS to interview him, during this interview the applicant will have to deliver them a letter of recommendation from his manager at high school and also an essay explaining why he choose the major and what he is planning to do if admitted. Teaching facilities Biblioteca, Tec de Monterrey, Guadalajara Ciberplaza, Tec de Monterrey, Guadalajara Gardens, Tec de Monterrey, Guadalajara Inside the ITESM system only 4 campus out of 33 offer the possibility of studying the M.D major, this campuses are Monterrey, Chihuahua, Guadalajara and Ciudad de M√©xico, three of these have facilities specially dedicated to the medical school. Campus Monterrey was the first one to introduce the medical major at ITESM, so the history and buildings related to this are the most significant. In Campus Garza Sada( Monterrey) the students have classrooms as well as a hospital in which they practice and take class. This hospital is the San Jos√© hospital that was donated in 1969 by Don Ignacio A. Santos and his wife Do√±a Consuelo De La Garza Evia with the main purpose of giving place for investigation and treatment of patients with oncologic issues. Currently the San Jose hospital gives attention to all the patients who are willing to be attended by physicians graduated from EMIS and also by students from the EMIS who are coursing from 5th semester to 9th, the technology inside the building one of the best offered in Latin-America giving them the affiliation to the Methodist health care system. The second campus that offers a M.D. major is Campus Ciudad De M√©xico, in 2011, ITESM decided to build a new facility called \\"Scientific Park\\". This building will have specific scientific laboratories aimed at solving the needs of biotech engineering and biomedical engineering, as well as modern equipment for the development of activities for both careers. Furthermore, the government created an agreement with ITESM and now a department in charge of watching, supporting, and promoting new inventions is created and will take place in the facility. Campus Guadalajara has dedicated facilities for the lectures and clinical practices of the Medical Doctor program (M√©dico Cirujano), the biomedical engineering program, the nutritionist program, and the biotechnology program. The Medicine and Health Building, also known informally as the EMS (Edificio de Medicina y Salud), has 4 stories, one dedicated to the nutrition program, one dedicated to the biotech program, and two dedicated to the problem based learning teaching method used in the MD program. The school has 12 laboratories, including an anatomy lab, a pathology lab, a microbiology lab, and a food science lab.http://www.milenio.com/jalisco/Inaugura-TEC-Monterrey-Guadalajara- edificio_0_142186116.html The Guadalajara Biotechnology and Health Division is chaired by Arturo Santos Garc√≠a, MD PhD.

He was a well-known illustrator whose work appeared in numerous newspapers and periodicals. His fine art was displayed in gallery exhibitions alongside Vuillard, Matisse and Toulouse-Lautrec. Early works were noted for their satiric characterizations of the foibles of French society. His points were made with simple caricature. His illustrations relied on blotches of pure black with minimum outline to define his animated marionettes. His exhibition pieces were carried by large splashes of color and those same fine lines of black. Hermann-Paul worked in Ripolin enamel paint, watercolors, woodcuts, lithographs, drypoint engraving, oils, and ink. Recent efforts to catalog the work of Hermann-Paul reveal an artist of considerable scope. On the eve of the First World War, he made quite an impression as part of M. Druet's \\"First Group.\\" As noted by the Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, the exhibition was \\"chiefly remarkable for a series of paintings or drawings - it is hard to say which - by M. Hermann-Paul in a new medium which is simply ripolin.\\"The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, Vol. 24, No. 129 (Dec., 1913), pp. 172-174 The Great War soon intervened and Hermann-Paul would document its tragedy as well as its foibles. After the war, he underwent several stylistic changes. In his later years, he produced many works in dry point and ink depicting his beloved Camargue.  Early work  Between 1890 and 1914 he worked as a lithographer (both in color and in black and white) and as an illustrator for weekly publications such as La Faridondaine, Le Courrier Fran√ßais, Le Cri de Paris, Le Figaro, Le Petit Bleu, Gil-Blas and Le Rire. Despite great elegance and beauty, his work was imbued with social criticism from the start. Although the bourgeoisie received the brunt of his mockery, Hermann-Paul prodded all aspects of Parisian society. He was critical of rich and poor alike. He attacked monarchs, paupers, politicians, clerics and elements of the established order. Peripheral players in the art world received particular attention. L'Assiette au beurre n¬∞ 14, 4 July 1901. As early as 1895 his famous Vie de Monsieur Quelconque and Vie de Madame Quelconque poked holes in the established understanding of the typical aspirations of the middle class in matters both public and private. By 1900 most Parisians familiar with the local news weeklies were aware of the artist's work. He was a staunch defender of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, whom he considered an innocent man. The artist's suspicions were substantiated after one of Dreyfus's accusers broke down under interrogation. Hubert-Joseph Henry confessed that the damning documents were actually forged. After Henry slit his throat in prison, Hermann-Paul produced a cartoon in which two people stand over the fresh grave of Major Henry. One says to the other, \\"This one, at least, won't give us any trouble.\\" Avec celui-l√† au moins on est tranquille. A Woman Sewing (ca. 1900)During this time, Hermann-Paul produced work in the \\"intimiste\\" style which often depicted bourgeois settings populated by women sipping tea or quietly sewing. The term was coined ‚Äì derisively, it seems ‚Äì by √âdouard Vuillard who used it to describe his own style.Laurie Shannon, \\"The Country of our Friendship\\": Jewett's Intimist Art, American Literature, Vol. 71, No. 2, (June 1999), pp 227 Other practitioners include Maurice Lobre, Hughes de Beaumont, Henri Matisse, Rene Prinet and Ernest Laurent. The Intimists first collective exhibition was shown at Henry Grave's galleries in 1905.The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, Vol. 7, No. 25. (Apr., 1905) The exhibition included several works by Hermann-Paul.  The Great War  The Four Seasons of Culture plate number fourBy the summer of 1914, Hermann-Paul was firmly entrenched in the political left. A decade earlier, the Dreyfus Affair cleaved the country decisively along the lines of left and right; there was little doubt as to where the artist stood. Dreyfusards tended to be radicals, liberals, republicans, anti-clericals and pacifists. Their opponents tended to be royalists, conservatives, anti- Semites, and supporters of the church and army. In the years leading up to the war, Hermann-Paul's political commentary was consistent with the views of the political left. There was nothing in his published work to indicate the sharp turn he was about to take. When the war began that fateful summer, the general populace was caught completely off guard. It arrived in Europe like a \\"peal of thunder reverberating in a clear sky.\\" For Hermann-Paul, there was little doubt as to who was responsible; he blamed the Germans whose armies were marching toward Paris. Hermann-Paul was almost fifty when the Great War began. As an energetic man, he was likely hobbled by a general sense of uselessness. He channeled that energy into his art and he proceeded to document the war. It was at this time, when the artist switched mediums. His earlier print work required metal which was suddenly in short supply. By necessity, Hermann-Paul switched to wood. He started making woodcuts. His first major series in wood was The Four Seasons of Culture, a series of five woodcuts that depicted atrocities committed by the Germans in Belgium. The series is rich in texture and stunning in its detail. It depicts looting, burning and rape. It was met with immediate backlash from the political left. With his depiction of a brutal enemy raping its way across Europe, critics on the left claimed he was helping to shut down avenues toward peace. Negotiations were impossible with Hermann-Paul's brutal Bosch. This type of work would only help prolong the war, they said. His next major work did little to placate his new found critics. It was entitled Calendrier de la Guerre, Calendar of the War. It tends to promote patriotic attitudes toward the war and the generals who conducted it. For the left, these were the generals who senselessly sent young men to slaughter in pointless attacks against entrenched machine guns. As far as they were concerned, Hermann-Paul became a traitor to the cause of peace. Le Sourire cover designed by Hermann-PaulLa veuve : - Eh bien, ma pauvre enfant... : - Ah ! ch√®re amie, il n'√©tait assur√© que pour 20.000 francs ! Perle des Antilles (from La Feuille)  Post-war  Femme Espagnole (1920) After the war, he continued to work in the media he discovered by circumstance. Metal shortages compelled him to search for another print form and that's when he discovered the modernist woodcut. He would continue to work in wood until age started to get the best of him in the late 1930s. During this time, he produced many fine art prints and book illustrations. Hermann- Paul did a sizeable number of illustrations for Candide in the interwar period, but these were the exception rather than the rule. Wood was without question, his primary form. His post-war illustrations tended to be apolitical, in stark contrast with his pre-war work. Hermann-Paul's first major post-war work was a morbid series of woodcuts in book form, The Dance With Death (La danse macabre; vingt gravures sur bois). The series depicts death's passage through the modern world. Men are seen as isolated and lonely creatures. The meaning of individual works is not always clear but the series is a firm indictment of modern mechanized warfare. It did little to placate old allies. Unable to mend old fences with the political left and not disposed toward the tendencies of the right, Hermann-Paul abandoned politics in the interwar period. His inspirations become more literary than journalistic and his style evolved from a belle √©poque line to a modernist simplification. Hermann-Paul practiced some painting on canvas, but it was never a form he mastered. First and foremost his contribution to the art world resides in his daring composition of the 1890s and 1920s in lithography and in woodcut respectively. His many book illustrations, both reproductive and original also deserve much praise, as does his immense production of journalistic satire in the 1890s through the end of the 1910s. The unique works of art that should be remembered are beautiful works on paper: pastels, color drawings, watercolors and preparatory pencil sketches for his publications.  Rediscovered  During the 1980s, the Zimmerli Museum at Rutgers acquired no fewer than 150 pieces by the artist. They demonstrate a range of expression for which few collectors had previously given him credit. Interest has recently surged since Hermann-Paul's work was rediscovered by a larger public through the auction of his earlier pieces in October 2000 in Chartres. Many drawings and prints currently on the market bear the stamp of this sale on the verso.

DVD Maker has been removed as of Windows 8. History Windows DVD Maker was first reported by Paul Thurrott during the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference of 2003. Thurrott stated that Windows Vista, then known by its codename \\"Longhorn,\\" would support DVD movie creation \\"through an independent application, and not through the shell.\\" This information was accompanied by additional reports that Windows Vista would support all major DVD packet writing formats, such as Mount Rainier, and would also eliminate the \\"staging and burning\\" steps while writing to optical media‚Äîfiles copied to recordable media would instead be written immediately. The latter functionality is exposed via the Live File System. Features Windows DVD Maker is available on Home Premium, Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Windows Vista, as well as Home Premium, Professional, Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Windows 7. It has a simple Aero Wizard-style user interface, which takes the user through the process of creating DVD-Video. The first step involves importing video files, arranging them to play in proper order. Windows DVD Maker automatically splits the videos into scenes that can be accessed from a special scene selection page in the DVD menu. In the next step, animated DVD menus can be added to the compilation. Windows DVD Maker can also add a slide show of pictures with a musical accompaniment and transition effects. Many of these are similar to the transition effects available in Windows Movie Maker. Users can also customize the font and button styles. The application can show an interactive preview of what the DVD will look and act like when it has been burned. For example, users can navigate the DVD menus, testing them.

He is currently the defensive coordinator for the Tampa Bay Vipers. From 1987 to 1990, Archer was the head football coach at Louisiana State University, where he compiled a record of 27‚Äì18‚Äì1. Archer has also served as an assistant coach at his alma mater University of Miami, the University of Virginia, and the University of Kentucky, the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL), and with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Coaching career Archer came to LSU as an assistant coach in 1984 after being both a player and an assistant coach at Miami. He replaced Bill Arnsparger as the LSU Tigers football head coach in 1987 when Arnsparger left to become the athletic director at the University of Florida. Archer was Arnsparger's defensive coordinator in 1985 and 1986, and was Arnsparger's hand-picked successor. When Archer took the LSU head coaching job, he was 34 years old, the youngest head coach in Division I-A football. Archer was chosen over a number of interviewed candidates, which reportedly included Steve Spurrier, Mike Shanahan, and Mack Brown. Arnsparger later hired Spurrier at head football coach at Florida. In 1987, LSU finished the season ranked #5 in both major polls with a 10‚Äì1‚Äì1 record, blemished only by a tie against Ohio State and a loss to Alabama. The latter was all that kept the Tigers out of the 1988 Sugar Bowl; Auburn went instead. It was LSU's first 10-win season in more than 25 years. Archer's Tigers followed up with an 8‚Äì4 record and a share of the Southeastern Conference title in 1988. The 1988 season was famous for the \\"Earthquake Game,\\" a 7‚Äì6 victory over Auburn. While LSU and Auburn shared the conference title as a result, Auburn got the SEC's berth in the Sugar Bowl due to a higher poll ranking, and LSU lost in the Hall of Fame Bowl. After back-to-back losing seasons in 1989 and 1990, Archer was forced to resign. He lost four of his last five games in 1990, the lone win coming in the season finale against Tulane. Archer was replaced by Curley Hallman, previously the head coach at the University of Southern Mississippi. After leaving LSU, Archer remained in coaching, but strictly as a defensive assistant. In 1991, he became linebackers coach at Virginia. In 1993, he moved on to coach linebackers at Kentucky and was named assistant head coach there in 1995. Archer jumped to the NFL in 1996, where he served as linebackers coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers for seven years. He returned to Kentucky as defensive coordinator in 2003. Archer resigned from his position at Kentucky on January 10, 2007 to accept the same job at NC State, where he was reunited with Tom O'Brien. Archer and O'Brien worked together at Virginia from 1991 to 1992. In 2014, Archer rejoined the staff at Virginia, where O'Brien was the associate head coach. In May 2017, he became linebacker coach with the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL. He was promoted to defensive coordinator for the 2018 season. In 2019, Archer joined former Argonauts head coach Marc Trestman at the Tampa Bay Vipers of the XFL.

The roof and shutters are from the 18th century. Parts of the wall of the first three floors are from the 1520-30s. View of Riddarholmen from the Stockholm City Hall centred on Birger Jarls torn. Birger Jarls torn (Swedish for Birger Jarl's Tower) is a defensive tower on the northwest corner of Riddarholmen, an islet in Gamla Stan, the old town of Stockholm. The building has been named for Birger Jarl who traditionally is attributed as the founder of Stockholm, but it was built several hundred years later and the name is mostly the product of a 17th-century myth. Stockholm literally translates to \\"Log-Islet\\", and according to that myth the city was founded where a log drifting ashore from Lake M√§lar.  History  Detail from V√§dersolstavlan (original from 1535) showing Birger jarls torn (left) and Vasatornet (right) Tower of Birger Jarl seen in a detail of an engraving from the 1580s Often mentioned as the oldest building in town, the tower in fact was built by King Gustav I of Sweden around 1530 in his efforts to reinforce and modernize the fortifications of the capital. It replaced timbered redoubts destroyed by fire in 1525 and along with the southern tower of the Wrangel Palace, is the only remaining structure from a 16th-century defensive system. (Including images of the current interior.) Originally, a wall connected the two towers. For its construction, bricks were taken from St. Clare's Priory (Sankta Klara kloster near today's Sergels torg) when it was destroyed in 1527, and from churches on the ridges surrounding the city. The building was originally two stories high with a crenellated top. Toward the waterfront, the base of the cavity wall was made very thick, almost 2,5 metres at the base and about 0,75 centimetres at the top, while the other side was considerably thinner with much larger openings. In 1589-1590, the original crenellation was rebuilt into a third floor topped by a cone shaped roof, and the present white grouting was added to the fa√ßade. In the 1620s King Gustavus Adolphus begun to donate parcels of land on Riddarholmen to prominent members of the Swedish nobility, and the islet was gradually transformed into the palace laden location it still is. From the mid 17th century the tower, at the time called Rundelen (\\"the round tower\\"), was gradually attached more and more to surrounding buildings. It was thoroughly rebuilt in the mid-18th century, the original apertures then transformed into windows, while a fourth floor was added, topped by a new roof with a gilt sphere. Along with two flanking buildings, the 18th century restoration has been assumed to be designed by Carl H√•rleman. During the 19th century both the tower and the two flanking buildings were rebuilt many times to accommodate various activities and institutions such as a pawn shop and the city's archives. In the 1950s, the entire complex was completely rebuilt again with new concrete joints replacing old wooden ones, while new barred windows and a detached spiral staircase were added. Before housing the offices of the Chancellor of Justice in 2007, the building was carefully documented and restored in 2006. Some of the more recent additions were removed while some older, discontinued alterations were reinstated. All new additions were carefully adapted to the existing structure to emphasise its historical value, while making room for modern installations and accessibility requirements. The entire top floor has been transformed into a round conference room with an oval desk surrounded by the round windows. , the lower part of the building is intended to house restaurant business, to reduce the isolated state of the islet Riddarholmen and make it more attractive to Stockholmers.

It occurred on September 22, 1990, against Southern Illinois University in a 56‚Äì21 Illinois win.http://www.jhowell.net/cf/scores/Illinois.htm#1990 Griffith, raised in Chicago attended now defunct Mendel Catholic Prep High School of the Chicago Catholic League until his sophomore year. For his junior year, he transferred to Julian High School, where he was an All-City performer. Biography Griffith was drafted in the ninth round of the 1991 NFL Draft by the Indianapolis Colts, but never played a regular-season game for the Colts. Griffith made his NFL debut with the Los Angeles Rams in 1993. He played two seasons with the Rams, and then played two seasons with the Carolina Panthers after being selected in the 1995 NFL Expansion Draft. In 1997, Griffith joined the Denver Broncos, and played five seasons for the Broncos primarily as a blocking back for Terrell Davis. He didn't get very many rushing attempts, but was often used as a receiver out of the backfield, recording 27 receptions in 1996 and 26 in 1999. With the Broncos, Griffith won two Super Bowl rings in Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII. Griffith was a big contributor in the Broncos Super Bowl XXXIII win, scoring two rushing touchdowns in the game. He also made a key 23-yard reception in the final quarter of Super Bowl XXXII, setting up Denver's final touchdown of the game. While playing for the Broncos, Howard earned the nickname \\"The Human Plow\\" due to his successful blocking for Davis. Griffith retired from the NFL at the start of the 2002 season, due to a neck injury sustained in the 2001 preseason that caused him to miss the entire 2001 campaign. His final totals over his 11 NFL seasons include 351 rushing yards and three touchdowns, along with 122 receptions for 844 yards and nine touchdowns. Today, Griffith works as a football analyst. He is one of the lead in-studio analysts for the Big Ten Network, giving his weekly analysis of Big 10 football.

They became especially popular in England from the mid-19th century until their general decline alongside the use of the draft horse, and remain a collectors item today. Phalera is the archaeological term for equivalent disks, which were popular in Iron Age Europe, including Ancient Rome. History A modern souvenir horse brass featuring Gloucester cathedral In ancient Rome, horse harnesses were sometimes embellished with horse brasses known as phalerae, normally in bronze, cut or cast in the shape of a boss, disk, or crescent, most often used in pairs on a harness.Phalera, James Yates, M.A., F.R.S., on p. 894 of William Smith, D.C.L., LL.D.: A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, John Murray, London, 1875. In medieval England, decorative horse brasses were in use before the 12th century, serving as talismans and status symbols, but extensive, original research by members of the National Horse Brass Society has shown that there is no connection whatsoever between these bronze amulets to the working-class harness decorations used in the mid-19th century which developed as part of a general flowering of the decorative arts following the Great Exhibition. There are a great deal of die-hard, unfounded myths surrounding these decorations such as their usage as amulets to ward off the \\"evil eye\\". The most popular size is 3 √ó 3¬Ω inches of flat brass with a hanger by which the brass is threaded onto a horse harness strap, known as a Martingale. In England many of these items of harness found their way into country public houses as the era of the heavy horse declined, and are still associated today as a pub decoration. By the late 19th century heavy horses were decorated with brasses of all kinds and sizes. During this era working horse parades were popular throughout the British Isles and prize or merit awards were given, some by the Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA). Horse brasses were often highly prized by the \\"carters\\", who decorated their horse with them. Other horse brass subjects include advertising, royalty commemoration, and in later years, souvenir brasses for places and events, many of which are still being made and used today. Collection Collecting horse brasses for their own sake other than as decorations for harness seems to have commenced around 1880, when women bought the newly issued, pierced- design, die-struck brasses which were used for pin-cushions. A little later these were often used as fingerplates on doors which can be corroborated by accounts in the trade magazine, Saddler and Harness by the veteran saddler William Albery or Horsham in Sussex. From 1890 onward, collecting the various types of brass, i.e. face-pieces, swingers, and hame-plates, etc., became a highly popular pastime amongst the upper and middle classes. Indeed, the collecting of these humble brasses became especially popular amongst academics with many famous, early collections being formed by public schoolmasters and other prominent professionals, such as A.H. Tod,Horse Brass Collections No. 1 (1944) Henry Devonshire, Birmingham a Master at Charterhouse School and Dr Kirk of Pickering in Yorkshire, whose collection is still housed at the York Castle Museum in York. The writing about such items also commenced c. 1890s and was dominated by much Victorian romanticism surrounding the supposed, esoteric origin and ancient, unbroken lineage of these decorations. Such myths include their origin as talismanic symbols being brought back to England by homecoming knights returning from the Crusades, or in later years, by migrating Romani, though, once again, absolutely no evidence has ever been offered in support of these theories. =Cast brasses= Whatever the views of individual collectors as to when or where working-horse harness decoration first began in the British Isles, most collectors agree that cast brasses were the first to appear on the scene. Opinion is also still divided as to how, even these, originated, but once again, most collectors nowadays, are in agreement that the earliest decorations were simple, cast studs in a variety of shapes and sizes. The earliest types were probably even made locally by smiths or other skilled artisans but by the second half of the 19th century the production of such things had evolved from a local, decorative cult into a national fashion with the bulk of their production centred in and around the West Midlands.National Horse Brass Society, UK =Stamped brasses= Stamped brasses on heavy horse harness appeared on the scene around 1880, with a small number occurring perhaps a decade or so earlier, and it is highly likely that the process developed from one that was already established in the manufacture of carriage harness trappings and military insignia. However, production of these appears to have peaked shortly before the First World War, and since the 1920s, a few types have been produced but their quality is rather poor being made from thinner gauge brass sheet. Due to serious considerations of the sheer weight of cast harness decorations carried by working horses (first raised by the early animal welfare movements in the late 19th century) it is thought that the first stamped brasses were made as a lighter (and cheaper), alternative to cast brasses being later exported throughout the British Empire. Unlike their cast cousins, stamped brasses were not made in moulds, but pressed out of rolled sheet brass approximately 1/16 in thickness although other gauges of sheet than earlier examples. Due to the ease of their manufacture, many thousands of these stamped types were produced, but there are some that are very rare. The production of both cast and stamped brasses has continued since the demise of the British working horse but their manufacture is mainly centred on the souvenir trade, and other specialist manufacturers who provide for the heavy horse world who still breed and show the various breeds. The National Horse Brass Society of England has members all over the world and provides publications for members and swap meets.

The term refers to both the mission itself and the satellite that the mission used to collect data. TRMM was part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, a long-term, coordinated research effort to study the Earth as a global system. The satellite was launched on November 27, 1997 from the Tanegashima Space Center in Tanegashima, Japan. TRMM operated for 17 years, including several mission extensions, before being decommissioned in April 2015. TRMM re-entered Earth's atmosphere on June 16, 2015. Background Tropical precipitation is a difficult parameter to measure, due to large spatial and temporal variations. However, understanding tropical precipitation is important for weather and climate prediction, as this precipitation contains three-fourths of the energy that drives atmospheric wind circulation. Prior to TRMM, the distribution of rainfall worldwide was known to only a 50% degree of uncertainty.\\"Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission University.\\"NASA. Retrieved: 5 July 2015. The concept for TRMM was first proposed in 1984. The science objectives, as first proposed, were: * To advance understanding of the global energy and water cycles by providing distributions of rainfall and latent heating over the global Tropics. * To understand the mechanisms through which changes in tropical rainfall influence global circulation and to improve ability to model these processes in order to predict global circulations and rainfall variability at monthly and longer timescales. * To provide rain and latent heating distributions to improve the initialization of models ranging from 24-hour forecasts to short-range climate variations. * To help to understand, to diagnose, and to predict the onset and development of the El Ni√±o, Southern Oscillation, and the propagation of the 30- to 60-day oscillations in the Tropics. * To help to understand the effect that rainfall has on the ocean thermohaline circulations and the structure of the upper ocean. * To allow cross calibration between TRMM and other sensors with life expectancies beyond that of TRMM itself. * To evaluate the diurnal variability of tropical rainfall globally. * To evaluate a space-based system for rainfall measurements. Japan joined the initial study for the TRMM mission in 1986. Development of the satellite became a joint project between the space agencies of the U.S. and Japan, with Japan providing the Precipitation Radar (PR) and H-II launch vehicle, and the U.S. providing the satellite bus and remaining instruments. The project received formal support from the U.S. congress in 1991, followed by spacecraft construction from 1993 through 1997. TRMM launched from Tanegashima Space Center on 27 November 1997. Mission extensions and de-orbit To extend TRMM's mission life beyond its primary mission, NASA boosted the spacecraft's orbit altitude to 402.5 km in 2001. In 2005, NASA director Michael Griffin decided to extend the mission again by using the propellant originally intended for a controlled descent. This came after a 2002 NASA risk review put the probability of a human injury or death caused by TRMM's uncontrolled re-entry at 1-in-5,000, about twice the casualty risk deemed acceptable for re-entering NASA satellites; and a subsequent recommendation from the National Research Council panel that the mission be extended despite the risk of an uncontrolled entry. Battery issues began to limit the spacecraft in 2014 and the mission operations team had to make decisions about how to ration power. In March 2014, the VIRS instruments was turned off to extend the battery life. In July 2014, with propellant on TRMM running low, NASA decided to cease station-keeping maneuvers and allow the spacecraft's orbit to slowly decay, while continuing to collect data. The remaining fuel, initially reserved to avoid collisions with other satellites or space debris, was depleted in early March 2015. Re-entry was originally expected sometime between May 2016 and November 2017, but occurred sooner due to heightened solar activity.\\"Rainfall Research Satellite Begins Descent from Orbit\\". Spaceflight Now. Retrieved: 17 September 2014. The probe's primary sensor, the precipitation radar, was switched off for the final time April 1, 2015 and the final scientific sensor, LIS, was turned off on April 8, 2015. Re-entry occurred on June 16, 2015 at 06:54 UTC. Instruments aboard the TRMM =Precipitation Radar (PR)= The Precipitation Radar was the first space-borne instrument designed to provide three-dimensional maps of storm structure. The measurements yielded information on the intensity and distribution of the rain, on the rain type, on the storm depth and on the height at which the snow melts into rain. The estimates of the heat released into the atmosphere at different heights based on these measurements can be used to improve models of the global atmospheric circulation. The PR operated at 13.8 GHz and measured the 3-d rainfall distribution over land and ocean surfaces. It defined a layer depth of perception and hence measured rainfall that actually reached the latent heat of atmosphere. It had a 4.3 km resolution at radii with 220 km swath. =TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI)= The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) was a passive microwave sensor designed to provide quantitative rainfall information over a wide swath under the TRMM satellite. By carefully measuring the minute amounts of microwave energy emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere, TMI was able to quantify the water vapor, the cloud water, and the rainfall intensity in the atmosphere. It was a relatively small instrument that consumed little power. This, combined with the wide swath and the quantitative information regarding rainfall made TMI the \\"workhorse\\" of the rain-measuring package on Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission. TMI is not a new instrument. It is based on the design of the highly successful Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) which has been flying continuously on Defense Meteorological Satellites since 1987. The TMI measures the intensity of radiation at five separate frequencies: 10.7, 19.4, 21.3, 37, 85.5 GHz. These frequencies are similar to those of the SSM/I, except that TMI has the additional 10.7 GHz channel designed to provide a more-linear response for the high rainfall rates common in tropical rainfall. The other main improvement that is expected from TMI is due to the improved ground resolution. This improvement, however, is not the result of any instrument improvements, but rather a function of the lower altitude of TRMM 250 miles (402 kilometers) compared to 537 miles (860 kilometers) of SSM/I). TMI has a 547 mile (878-kilometer) wide swath on the surface. The higher resolution of TMI on TRMM, as well as the additional 10.7 GHz frequency, makes TMI a better instrument than its predecessors. The additional information supplied by the Precipitation Radar further helps to improve algorithms. The improved rainfall products over a wide swath will serve both TRMM as well as the continuing measurements being made by the SSM/I and radiometers flying on the NASA‚Äôs EOS- PM and the Japanese ADEOS-II satellites. =Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS)= The Visible and Infrared Scanner was one of the three instruments in the rain-measuring package and serves as a very indirect indicator of rainfall. VIRS, as its name implies, sensed radiation coming up from the Earth in five spectral regions, ranging from visible to infrared, or 0.63 to 12 micrometers. VIRS was included in the primary instrument package for two reasons. First was its ability to delineate rainfall. The second, and even more important reason, was to serve as a transfer standard to other measurements that are made routinely using POES and GOES satellites. The intensity of the radiation in the various spectral regions (or bands) can be used to determine the brightness (visible and near infrared) or temperature (infrared) of the source. =Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy Sensor (CERES)= CERES measured the energy at the top of the atmosphere, as well as estimates energy levels within the atmosphere and at the Earth's surface. The CERES instrument was based on the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment which used three satellites to provide global energy budget measurements from 1984 to 1993.NASA, Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) (accessed Sept. 9, 2014) Using information from very high resolution cloud imaging instruments on the same spacecraft, CERES determines cloud properties, including cloud-amount, altitude, thickness, and the size of the cloud particles. These measurements are important to understanding the Earth's total climate system and improving climate prediction models. It only operated during January - August 1998, and March 2000, so the available data record is quite brief (although later CERES instruments were flown on other missions such as the Earth Observing System (EOS) AM and PM satellites.) =Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS)= The Lightning Imaging Sensor was a small, highly sophisticated instrument that detects and locates lightning over the tropical region of the globe. The lightning detector was a compact combination of optical and electronic elements including a staring imager capable of locating and detecting lightning within individual storms. The imager's field of view allowed the sensor to observe a point on the Earth or a cloud for 80 seconds, a sufficient time to estimate the flashing rate, which told researchers whether a storm was growing or decaying.

He made a study of mechanics, learning the machinist trade thoroughly, and in 1892 invented a single cylinder engine. For a number of years he worked to devise a four-cylinder motor of commercial value. In 1898, he produced his first four-cylinder gasoline motor, establishing the Rutenber Manufacturing Company in Chicago to manufacture his new engines, the first four-cylinder engines to be manufactured in the United States. The fame of the design spread and the \\"Rutenber\\" motor was used in many early automobiles and attained a worldwide reputation. On October 3, 1900, Mr. Rutenber was married to Miss Edna L. Rolley, of Morris, Illinois. They had three children. His son Bradley Rutenber (1907-1979) was also an inventor of electric appliances. In June, 1902, the company was moved from Chicago to Logansport, Indiana and renamed Rutenber Motor Company and from that time E. A. Rutenber resided there. In July 1912, Rutenber disposed of his holdings in the engine manufacturing company, then called the Western Motor Company. Rutenber then devoted his energies to the manufacture of electric appliances. The Rutenber Electric Company, using the brand name RECO, was formed for that purpose in September 1912. Rutenber invented many of the devices the company manufactured, including the Marion Flip Flop Toaster which he patented in 1914 and was followed by the Marion Giant Flip Flop Toaster. In 1916 the company needed to increase its production capacity, but was constrained at the Logansport site. An agreement to relocate the company to Marion, Indiana and appliances including ranges, irons, grills, toasters, fans and more were manufactured there. By 1919, Rutenber had relocated his residence to Marion. In February 1921, Edwin Rutenber was elected president of the new Marion Fence Machinery Company, and from that time it appears his active participation in the management of the appliance company was severed. In the 1930s, Rutenber continued to invent new appliances. He assigned some of his electrical appliance patents to the A J Lindeman and Hoverson Company, a cooling equipment and heating system manufacturer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin that built commercial-scale baking and cooking equipment. In the 1940s, Edwin Rutenber was associated with the Gibson Refrigerator Company in Greenville, Michigan, assigning several patents to them. Edwin A. Rutenber died in Greenville, Michigan. After his death, some of his surviving family moved to the Nogales, Arizona area. In 1973, one of his descendants donated a Rutenber engine to the Smithsonian Institution. The manufacturing facilities of Rutenber Electric Company were acquired in 1958 by Active Products Corp. and Rutenber Electric ceased to be.
