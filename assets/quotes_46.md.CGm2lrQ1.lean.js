Administratively, the park is in Kremenets District and Shumsk District in Ternopil Oblast. Topography The mountains of the park's name are the southeastern third of the Hologoro-Kremenetskiy ridge, which stretches 170 km across the west of Ukraine. They consist of highly eroded hills of chalk, clay and limestone. The terrain is one of low ridges and plateaus cut by ravines, river and stream valleys, and gullies. On the northern slopes, the mountains drop at a steep incline to the valley of the Little Polisia plains. Rocky outcrops of chalk and marl form terraces and ledges. Individual hills are separated from others where erosion has worn away lighter rock. Danilova Mountain, one of the natural and cultural attractions in Kremenets Mountains National Nature Park As with many Ukrainian National Parks, Kremenets Mountains was created to encompass a number of smaller protected areas, both natural and cultural. These subsidiary units usually retain their original legal structure. In Kremenets Mountains, these subsidiary units include: * The Veselovsky Botanical Reserve, an oak-hornbeam- ash forest over 100 years in age. * The state-owned Dovzhotsky Botanical Preserve, a similar oak-hornbeam-ash forest. * The locally owned Belokrynitsky Zoological Reserve, protecting the reproduction and restoration of animals under pressure from hunting. * The locally owned Volynsky Zoological Reserve, protecting hunted animals, as well as the locally vulnerable European badger * \\"Slavic Rock\\" natural monument, a group of large limestone pillars, said to be a favorite visiting spot of Polish Poet Juliusz S≈Çowacki * \\"Mt. Stitch\\", a geological monument, forming a conical mountain of chalk, marl, sand and limestone with a flat top. * Danilova Mountain ('Mount Trinity'), on which still stands the Holy Trinity church of the 12th century Overall, the average ridge height is 100 ‚Äì 200 meters above the surrounding territory, or 350 ‚Äì 400 meters above sea level. At the base of the ridge is a layer of white chalk, which may be up to 100 meters thick. This is overlaid by a layer of sand, laid down by the Galician Sea 15-20 million years ago, over which are layers of sandstone and limestone. Over all is a layer of Quaternary yellow loess and loams, 10 ‚Äì 30 meters thick. Climate and ecoregion The climate of Kremenets is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. Kremenets is in the Central European mixed forests ecoregion. Flora and fauna Kremenets Mountains exhibit the flora and fauna of the southern edge of the Central European mixed forests ecoregion, with some aspects of the northern Forest steppe. Forest types are predominantly oak, elm, and pine. Well developed agricultural fields surround the park on the plains. Biodiversity is high because the area is in the transition between marine and continental zones, as well as different geographic regions. Over 1,200 species of plants have been identified on the site, and 16 species are endemic to Kremenets Mountains. The park protects the critically endangered species of birch tree, the Klokov birch (\\"Betula klokovii\\"), which grows on only two mountain tops, both in the Kremenets Mountains park. Public use Park logo There are hiking trails open to the major natural and cultural sights. Scientists in the park conduct educational classes for the local schoolchildren.

The drug is being developed by Chugai Pharmaceutical, a subsidiary of Roche. Satralizumab regulates inflammation by inhibiting the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, a key mediator of the immune response. The most common side effects include the common cold (nasopharyngitis), headache, upper respiratory tract infection, inflammation of the lining of the stomach, rash, joint pain, extremity pain, fatigue and nausea.  Medical uses  Satralizumab is indicated for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in adults with a particular antibody ‚Äì people who are anti-aquaporin-4 or AQP4 antibody- positive. NMOSD is a rare autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that mainly affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. In people with NMOSD, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and proteins in the body, most often those in the optic nerves and spinal cord. Individuals with NMOSD typically have attacks of optic neuritis, which causes eye pain and vision loss. Approximately 50% of people with NMOSD have permanent visual impairment and paralysis caused by NMOSD attacks. Estimates vary, but NMOSD is thought to impact approximately 4,000 to 8,000 Americans. NMOSD can be associated with antibodies that bind to a protein called aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Binding of the anti-AQP4 antibody appears to activate other components of the immune system, causing inflammation and damage to the central nervous system.  Contraindications  Vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines is not recommended during treatment and should be administered at least four weeks before starting satralizumab.  Side effects  The most common side effects observed were the common cold (nasopharyngitis), headache, upper respiratory tract infection, inflammation of the lining of the stomach, rash, joint pain, extremity pain, fatigue and nausea. The FDA label for satralizumab includes a warning for increased risk of infection, including serious and potentially fatal infections ‚Äì such as potential reactivation of hepatitis B and tuberculosis. Other warnings and precautions for satralizumab include elevated liver enzymes, decreased neutrophil counts and hypersensitivity reactions.  Pharmacology  = Mechanism of action = Satralizumab is a humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody that binds to soluble and membrane-bound human interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptors and thereby prevents IL-6-mediated signal transmission through these receptors. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is produced by a large number of cell types and is involved in a variety of inflammatory processes. Patients with NMO and NMOSD have elevated levels of IL-6 in cerebro-spinal fluid and serum during periods of active disease. Some of the pro-inflammatory processes involved in NMOSD are thought to involve IL-6, including the formation of pathological autoantibodies against aquaporin-4 (AQP4), and the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to mediators of inflammation. = Efficacy = The effectiveness and safety of satralizumab for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) were demonstrated in two 96-week clinical studies. A study of satralizumab as monotherapy for NMOSD included 95 adult participants, 64 of whom had antibodies against AQP4 (i.e. were anti-AQP4 positive). During this study, treatment with satralizumab reduced the number of NMOSD relapses by 74% in participants who were anti-AQP4 positive compared to treatment with a placebo (inactive treatment). A study of satralizumab as an adjuvant to immunosuppressant treatment for NMOSD included 76 adult participants; 52 were anti-AQP4 positive. Immunosuppressant treatment in combination with satralizumab reduced the rate of relapses in participants who were anti-AQP4 positive by four-fifths compared to immunosuppressant treatment alone. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved satralizumab based on evidence from two clinical trials (Trial 1/ NCT02073279 and Trial 2/NCT02028884) of 116 participants with NMOSD who were anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive. The trials were conducted at 62 sites in the Unites States, Canada, Europe and Asia. Participants received at random either satralizumab or placebo injections according to the schedule. Neither the participants nor the healthcare providers knew which treatment was being given. In the second trial, all participants were also receiving their current immunosuppressive medications for the treatment of NMOSD. The benefit of satralizumab was evaluated by measuring the time to the first attack and comparing it to placebo. There was no evidence of a benefit in participants who were anti-AQP4 antibody negative in either trial.  Society and culture  = Legal status = Satralizumab was approved for the treatment of AQP4-IgG-seropositive NMOSD in Canada, Japan, and Switzerland. Satralizumab was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2020. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for satralizumab fast track and orphan drug designations. The FDA granted the approval of Enspryng to Genentech Inc. Satralizumab is the third approved treatment for NMOSD in the United States. = Names = Satralizumab is the international nonproprietary name (INN) and the United States Adopted Name (USAN).

On November 2, 1893, a solemn consecration of the station took place, and a rail link along the route Vladivostok - Ussuriysk was opened. Initially, it was a stone building with an iron roof, in the middle of the one-story, on the edges - a two-story. The floors in the building were covered with clay Japanese plates - they are well preserved to this day. In 1910‚Äì1912, in connection with the construction of Moscow Yaroslavsky railway station, the station in Vladivostok was designed and expanded by the civil engineering engineer V. A. Planson in the image and similarity of Yaroslavsky, creating architecturally finished stations at both ends of the Trans‚ÄìSiberian railway. The original building became one of the parts of the railway station. On the western facade was the mosaic coat of arms of the Primorskaya Oblast, on the east - the coat of arms of Moscow. Since 1924, the appearance of the building began to change gradually: a two-headed eagle was shot, mosaic panels with coats of arms disappeared under a layer of plaster, relief images of glazed ceramics on Russian folklore and fairy tales. The color of the facade has changed from yellow to green. In 1936, the interiors of the station were painted by the artist G. Grigorovich, and twenty years later V. Gerasimenko painted the ticket hall, creating a panel ‚ÄúOur Great Motherland‚Äù there. In the seventies and eighties of the twentieth century, the outer walls were painted green. The restoration of the building, carried out in 1994-1996 by the Russian-Italian company Tegola Canadese, brought the building closer to the pre-revolutionary appearance.

On September 28, 2018, the flight, operated by a Boeing 737, landed short of the runway at Chuuk International Airport in Weno (FSM) and came to rest in Chuuk Lagoon. Locals in small boats rescued most passengers and all crew members. One passenger was initially declared missing. He was later found dead by rescue divers. Forty-six people survived but six of them were injured. Aircraft and crew P2-PXE, the aircraft involved in the accident, in 2014. The accident aircraft was a Boeing 737-8BK, registration P2-PXE, msn 33024, Boeing line number 1688. It had first flown on 1 April 2005. At the time of the accident the aircraft had accumulated 37,160 hours and 36 minutes flight time in 14,788 cycles. The aircraft was originally registered VT-AXC for Air India Express and was delivered on 19 April 2005. On 6 July 2005, it was damaged in a runway excursion on landing at Cochin International Airport, India. On 29 July 2010, the aircraft was sold to Jet Airways and was registered VT-JBT. It was sold to CIT Leasing Corporation on 24 July 2013 and registered M-ABGK before being sold to Loftleidir, which leased the aircraft to Air Niugini on 13 September 2013. The aircraft was registered P2-PXE. On 12 May 2018, it was struck by Lockheed L-100 Hercules N403LC of Lynden Air Cargo whilst parked at Port Moresby Airport, sustaining damage to its right winglet. The captain and pilot in command was a 52-year-old Papua New Guinean male who had 19,780 flight hours, including 2,276 hours on the Boeing 737. The first officer was a 35-year-old Australian male who had 4,618 flight hours, with 368 of them on the Boeing 737. An engineer from Loftleidir was also on board and was sitting in the cockpit jumpseat. He was filming the landing for recreation purposes using his cell phone. The phone survived the accident and the video was used for the subsequent investigation. Accident The aircraft was operating an internationally scheduled passenger flight from Pohnpei Airport, FSM to Port Moresby Airport, Papua New Guinea via Chuuk International Airport, FSM. At 10:10 local time (00:10 UTC), the aircraft landed in the Chuuk lagoon short of Chuuk International Airport. Initial reports stated that all twelve crew and 35 passengers were rescued by local boats and United States Navy personnel. However, the body of one male passenger was later found by rescue divers searching the accident site. Air Niugini stated that the deceased passenger had been seen by other passengers, evacuating the aircraft. Nine people were taken to hospital. The preliminary report into the accident states that the body of the deceased passenger was recovered from the aircraft. Six people were seriously injured. Some of the injured sustained broken bones. It was reported that there were thunderstorms in the vicinity of the airport at the time of the accident. The aircraft subsequently sank in of water. Investigation The Papua New Guinea Accident Investigation Commission opened an investigation into the accident. The Department of Transportation, Communications & Infrastructure in the Federated States of Micronesia opened an investigation. A preliminary report was issued on October 26. On July 18, 2019, the Papua New Guinea Accident Investigation Commission issued its final report: the flight crew did not comply with Air Niugini Standard Operating Procedures, nor the approach or pre-landing checklists, and did not adequately brief the approach. The flight path became unstable after autopilot disconnect. The Precision Approach Path Indicator was showing three white lights just before entering Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). The rate of descent significantly exceeded 1,000 feet/min in IMC. The glideslope deviated from half dot low to two dots high within nine seconds after passing the Minimum Descent Altitude. The flight crew heard, but disregarded, thirteen Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) aural alerts (Glideslope and Sink Rate) and flew a 4.5¬∞ average glideslope. EGPWS showed a visual PULL UP warning on the Primary Flight Display. The pilots lost situational awareness. The approach was unstabilised, but the captain did not execute a missed approach. The copilot was ineffective and oblivious to the rapidly unfolding unsafe situation. A continuous WHOOP WHOOP PULL UP aural warning could have been effective in alerting the crew of the imminent danger.

Following the capture of Wuhan during the Northern Expedition, the existing Kuomintang (KMT) government, which had been based in Guangzhou, moved there in December 1926. In April 1927, after National Revolutionary Army (NRA) commander-in-chief Chiang Kai- shek purged communists and leftists in the \\"Shanghai massacre\\", the Wuhan government split from Chiang in what is known as the \\"Nanjing‚ÄìWuhan split\\" (). Chiang subsequently formed his own government in Nanjing. While Chiang continued the Northern Expedition on his own, increasing tensions between communists and the KMT in the Wuhan government resulted in a new purge of communists from that government, and an eventual reconciliation with the Nanjing faction, after which the government moved to Nanjing. History = Background = Despite Kuomintang founder Sun Yat-sen's policy of collaborating with the Communist Party of China (CPC) in the First United Front, a discrepancy existed between the two parties' ultimate goals for the revolution, and there had been constant conflict between them, such as the March 1926 Canton Coup. Joseph Stalin tried to persuade the small Communist Party to merge with the Kuomintang to bring about a bourgeois revolution before attempting to bring about a Soviet-style working class revolution. Stalin funded the KMT during the Northern Expedition to reunify China. Stalin said that NRA commander-in-chief Chiang Kai-shek was the only one capable of defeating the imperialists, and that his forces were to be squeezed for all usefulness like a lemon before being discarded. During the expedition, labour movements led by the Communist Party endangered commercial interests' support of the KMT. Land reform incited further dissatisfaction among generals and soldiers in the National Revolutionary Army who came from landowning families. For example, the landholding family of General He Jian were paraded through the streets as criminals by communists. = Formation of the Wuhan government = Third Plenary Session of the KMT Second Central Committee in Wuhan, March 1927 The National Revolutionary Army, military arm of the KMT, captured the three cities of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang in a series of battles from August to October 1926 during the early stage of the Northern Expedition, and merged their municipal governments to form Wuhan. After the Wuhan area had fallen to the KMT, local workers organized themselves into left-leaning trade unions, which grew to around 300,000 members by the end of the year. Trade unions also emerged in other NRA-held cities, while peasant uprisings spread throughout the countryside. Backed by these emerging mass-movements, members of the Kuomintang relocated from Guangzhou to Wuhan, and formed a new nationalist government in December. In order to consolidate the conquest, it was in the interest of the KMT to relocate from Guangzhou to Wuhan. Chiang initially invited the government to move to Wuhan but later demurred and tried to keep the members of the central committees in Nanchang, Jiangxi, where his headquarters was located.Beifa Zhanzheng yu Beiyang Junfa de fumie, ed. Tianshi Yang, Vol. 5 of Zhonghua Minguo Shi, ed. Xin Li (Beijing: Zhonghua Book Company, 2011). By the time the government moved to Wuhan with its left- leaning leadership including Sun Fo, Xu Qian, T. V. Soong, the peasant and labor movement led by communists and leftists of Kuomintang was in full swing in Hunan and Hubei. It was during this period that Mao Zedong prepared his Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan that severely criticized Party leadership. Chiang Kai-shek, who had been leader of the KMT since the Canton Coup in March 1926, opted to stay at his military headquarters in Nanchang. He did not wanted to become involved in the politics at Wuhan, instead preferring to focus on the conquest of the rest of China while maintaining his independence from other KMT leaders. In January 1927, violent protests broke out in the British concession at Hankou, resulting in its evacuation by the British and handover to the Chinese. Under such an atmosphere the leftists expanded control over the Kuomintang government in the Third Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of Kuomintang. The party congress elected a majority of communists and leftists into the central committees, and therefore strengthened the Soviet hold on the party at the expense of Chiang Kai-shek.ÈÉ≠Âª∑‰ª•Ôºö„Ää‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÂè≤‰∫ãÊó•Ë™å„ÄãÔºåÁ¨¨‰∫åÂÜäÊùéÈõ≤Êº¢Ôºö„ÄäÂæûÂÆπÂÖ±Âà∞Ê∏ÖÈª®„ÄãÔºå‰∏ãÂÜä Areas under Wuhan's control, such as Changsha, were plastered with propaganda posters with slogans including: \\"Communism is the heart of China\\", \\"Foster the mother country of the proletariat ‚Äî Soviet Russia\\", and \\"China and Russia are one\\". At the same time, Chiang was arresting communists as he advanced downstream the Yangtze River. It was widely suspected that the Communist Party of China and Soviet advisors in the Wuhan government used anti-imperialist and anti- foreign sentiments to instigate violent confrontations with foreign militaries in the Nanjing incident to strengthen the communists while simultaneously damaging the right-wing faction of the Kuomintang.ÈÉ≠Âª∑‰ª•Ôºå‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÂè≤‰∫ãÊó•Ë™åÔºåÂè∞ÂåóÔºå‰∏≠Â§ÆÁ†îÁ©∂Èô¢Ëøë‰ª£Âè≤Á†îÁ©∂ÊâÄÔºå1985Âπ¥Ë°õËó§ÁÄãÂêâÔºåË°õËó§ÁÄãÂêâËëó‰ΩúÈõÜÔºåÁ¨¨3Âç∑ÔºåÊù±ÊñπÊõ∏Â∫óKeiji Furaya, Chiang Kai-Shek His Life and Times, translated by Chun-Ming Chang, (St.John's University 1981) p.189 Leaders of Wuhan Nationalist government It was under these circumstances that a divergence between the KMT and CPC appeared. KMT rightist figures like Chiang Kai-shek pushed for the \\"complete clearance of the Communist Party\\". Meanwhile, KMT leftists, CPC and the Communist International were alarmed and decided to support the leftist leader Wang Jingwei who previously had been exiled abroad. The Wuhan government, which was dominated by leftist KMT politicians from the beginning, aided by the Communist Party of China, as well as widespread grassroots support, transformed Wuhan into \\"a seedbed for revolution\\", while portraying themselves as the sole legitimate leadership of the KMT. Controlling much of Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong and Jiangxi, the Wuhan government began challenging Chiang's authority, and launched a propaganda campaign against him from January 1927. On 10 March, the Wuhan leadership nominally stripped Chiang of much of his military authority, though refrained from deposing him as commander-in-chief. At the same time, the Communist Party became an equal partner in the Wuhan government, sharing power with the KMT leftists. In response to these developments, Chiang started to rally anti-communist elements in the KMT and NRA around him. Meanwhile, the Wuhan government began to face severe administrative problems. While the grassroots movements had originally been among its most important supporters, their actions sowed social instability and economic chaos in the areas under its control. They drove out foreigners, including several economically important firms, and suppressed middle and small merchants. Although the Wuhan government was reluctant to alienate the communist-leaning workers, they could hardly tolerate the ongoing social trend, as they were beginning to create severe financial downturn. By May 1927, the Wuhan government had an expenditure of 10 million Chinese dollars in contrast to a revenue of just 1.8 million dollars. Inflation and mass layoffs further worsened the economic situation. Furthermore, the countryside began to descend into chaos, as peasant rebels took control of large swaths of land. The communists generally claimed that the rural insurgents were under their control, but in reality these insurgents were often independent groups or simply found themselves allied with the leftists. Regardless of the political position of the peasants, the Wuhan government tried to sway them to their side through a reform program, although the planned agrarian reform never really took off. Instead, the rural insurgents started to govern themselves, which in response alienated much of the NRA officials as the Kuomintang military leadership were generally opposed to peasant self-rule. =Nanjing‚ÄìWuhan split= Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-Shek in 1926 On 1 April 1927, Wang Jingwei returned to China, and arrived at Shanghai, which had been occupied by the National Revolutionary Army. Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren met with him to urge him to end the collaborative relations with the CPC as the president of the Wuhan government, but Wang stated that he would \\"pick up side with the workers and farmers\\",„ÄäÁúüÂÆûÁöÑÊ±™Á≤æÂç´„ÄãÔºåÁ¨¨‰∫åÈÉ®ÂàÜ‰πã‰∏âÔºö‰ªéÊã•ÂÖ±Âà∞ÂèçÂÖ± and proposed to tolerate the communists for the time being. Concurrently, violence broke out in Hankou, part of Wuhan, when trade unionists and communist agitators attacked the Japanese concession there, sparking the \\"Hankou incident\\". Wuhan garrison commander Tang Shengzhi and foreign minister Eugene Chen rushed to quell the disorder and assuage the Japanese. At a KMT senior officials' meeting in Shanghai on the following day, Wu Zhihui went so far as to kneel down and beg for Wang's assent to Chiang's proposals. The meeting only managed to proceed with Chiang Kai-shek's and others' mediation. In the fourth Plenary Session of the 2nd KMT Central Committee held in Nanjing, a consensus was reached on how to resolve the KMT-CPC dispute: However, on 5 April, Wang decided to take the initiative by privately publishing with Chen Duxiu the \\"Joint Declaration of the Leaders of the Nationalist and Communist Parties\\", in which he proclaimed a permanent collaboration between the two parties. This declaration drove the anti-communist KMT officials into a rage. Wu Zhihui, who had previously knelt down to beg Wang, mocked him as paternalistic, \\"the parent of the KMT\\". Wang left Shanghai that night for Wuhan, the government there being made up mostly of the communists and the KMT left-wing. Tang Shengzhi, leader of the Wuhan Army Wang Jingwei arrived at Wuhan on 10 April and met Tang Shengzhi and Tan Yankai, nominally to call together members of central committee to attend the fourth plenary session of the 2nd KMT Central Committee held in Nanjing. He thought that the meeting would be held as planned, but unexpectedly, Chiang Kai-shek rallied the anti-communist factions of Hu Hanmin and Li Jishen to \\"exterminate the communists\\" on 12 April, and formed a rival government in Nanjing (). Incensed and shocked, Wang declared that Chiang had been \\"expelled from the party and dismissed from all his posts\\", namely, the KMT central executive membership.1927Âπ¥4Êúà17Êó•‰∏≠ÂõΩÂõΩÊ∞ëÂÖö‰∏≠Â§ÆÊâßË°åÂßîÂëò‰ºöÈÄöÁîµ The Wuhan government responded by accusing Chiang and his followers of being the puppets of foreign imperialists and criticised his close cooperation with Shanghai's merchant class, arguing that he helped to oppress workers and peasants. On 18 April, the same day of the formation of the Nanjing government, during a public rally in Wuhan, Wang delivered a speech in which he severely condemned Chiang Kai-shek. The Nanjing and Wuhan governments were thus officially split. To prevent the Wuhan government from sending forces against the Nanjing government, Guangxi warlord Li Zongren and his subordinate Ying Yuhan went to Jiangxi and Wuhan respectively, to lobby Wang and other armed forces in Wuhan. They managed to convince both sides to continue the Northern Expedition in mutual non-interference, and on the 19th the Wuhan government appointed Hunan warlord Tang Shengzhi as Commander-in-chief to proceed with the Northern expedition. On 1 May, Chiang Kai Shek also continued with the Northern Expedition independently. By this point, however, the anti- communist sentiment in the NRA had grown significantly as result of internal tensions in Wuhan-controlled areas as well as agitation by the Nanjing faction. As result, the NRA's 14th Division under Xia Douyin rebelled in western Henan and marched against Wuhan in May, supported by Sichuan warlord Yang Shen. Though Xia was defeated by Wuhan loyalist Ye Ting's 24th Division and Yang's attack was repelled, the open rebellion further undermined the confidence of political and military leaders in the KMT toward the Wuhan leadership. =The \\"May Instructions\\"= On 1 June, Communist International (Comintern) representatives Mikhail Borodin and M. N. Roy received a secret telegram from Joseph Stalin with orders for the Wuhan government, which later became known as the \\"May Instructions\\". Without consulting Borodin or anyone else, Roy revealed the contents of the message to Wang Jingwei. The instructions presented the following demands: Wang Jingwei believed that if these instructions were followed the KMT might be destroyed, but continued negotiations with the Soviets. He requested that the Soviet Union provide 15 million Soviet rubles in aid, but Moscow offered only 2 million.„ÄäÊñØÂ§ßÊûóÁªôËé´Ê¥õÊâòÂ§´ÁöÑ‰ø°„ÄãÔºå1927Âπ¥6Êúà24Êó•Ôºõ„ÄäËÅîÂÖ±ÔºàÂ∏ÉÔºâ‰∏≠Â§ÆÊîøÊ≤ªÂ±Ä‰ºöËÆÆÁ¨¨113Âè∑ÔºàÁâπÂ≠óÁ¨¨91Âè∑ÔºâËÆ∞ÂΩï„ÄãÔºå1927Âπ¥6Êúà27Êó•Ôºå„ÄäËÅîÂÖ±ÔºàÂ∏ÉÔºâ„ÄÅÂÖ±‰∫ßÂõΩÈôÖ‰∏é‰∏≠ÂõΩÂõΩÊ∞ëÈù©ÂëΩËøêÂä®„ÄãÔºà‰∏ãÔºâÔºåÁ¨¨352Ôºå364È°µ„ÄÇ Later, Wang vented his frustration to chief Soviet adviser to the KMT Borodin, and considered sending him back to the Soviet Union. The Wuhan government meeting with Feng Yuxiang, June 1927 The \\"May Instructions\\" compelled Wang to diverge from the communists, but did nothing to quell his dislike for Chiang. In an effort to counter both the CPC and Chiang's Nanjing faction simultaneously, Wang sought the backing of Guominjun leader Feng Yuxiang, who controlled large parts of northern China. Without informing the CPC, he sent Deng Yanda to meet with Feng at Zhengzhou on 8‚Äì10 June. In the meeting, though Wang had offered Feng all possible concessions, Feng still insisted that Wang take the lead in parting from the communists. Given that Wuhan military commander-in-chief Tang Shengzhi had been badly wounded in a battle with warlord Zhang Zuolin in Henan province, hampering Wuhan's ability to defend itself, and that Feng had taken that opportunity to seize control of Henan, Wang Jingwei had to do as he requested, lest Wuhan be subject to an attack by Feng's forces. Unbeknownst to Wang Jingwei, Feng Yuxiang had dispatched Li Mingzhong to get in touch with Chiang Kai-shek, and managed to meet him in Xuzhou on 19 June. Compared to the nominal titles that Wang had offered, Chiang agreed to provide Feng with 2.5 million yuan monthly from July 1927 to cover military expenditures, and did not demand that he sever ties with the Wuhan government. Feng was immensely satisfied, and said that he wished he could have met Chiang earlier.ÂÜØÁéâÁ••Ëá™‰º†„ÄäÊàëÁöÑÁîüÊ¥ª„ÄãÔºöÂæêÂ∑û‰∏éËíã‰∏≠Ê≠£‰∏ÄËßÅ\\"ËßÅÂÖ∂È£éÈááÂèäË®ÄË∞àÊÄÅÂ∫¶ÔºåÊó†‰∏ç‰ΩøÊàëÊï¨ÊÖïÔºåÂ§ßÊúâÁõ∏ËßÅÊÅ®Êôö‰πãÊÉÖ\\" After the meeting, Feng wired a message to Wuhan in the name of both himself and Chiang, and demanded that the Wuhan government expel Soviet representative Mikhail Borodin, carry out a purge of communists within the party and finish the Northern Expedition, which forced Wuhan into an even weaker position. Views on the \\"May Instructions\\" varied within the Communist Party of China. When Chen Duxiu first read it he thought it did not fit into China's reality, and telegraphed back indicating that it was hard to be enforced. This, however, dissatisfied the Communist Party of Soviet Union and the Comintern. \\"Article 11 on the KMT‚ÄìCPC Union\\" had been passed by the expanded Central Committee on 30 June, and it suggested that the communists should consider breaking ties with the Wuhan government. Zhou Enlai in KMT military uniform On 4 July, the CPC held an expanded political bureau meeting on San Jiao Jie street, Hankou, Wuhan. General secretary Chen Duxiu and Borodin insisted that the instructions not be followed for the time being, but this was opposed by radical elements in the party. Apart from this, the two leaders decreed that the workers and farmers' movements in Hunan and Hubei be put on hold so as to rescue the united front with the KMT left wing. However, the Comintern deemed that by pausing workers and farmers' movements to maintain KMT membership status Chen and Borodin were guilty of \\"opportunism\\" and recalled Borodin to Russia immediately. On 8 July, the Comintern requested that all communists withdraw from KMT. On 12 July, Chen Duxiu's was dismissed as CPC general secretary, and a leaders' group constituting Zhou Enlai, Li Lisan, Li Weihan, Zhang Tailei and Zhang Guotao was formed (Qu Qiubai later joined them). Researcher Zhang Yufa speculates that the Comintern's intention was for an armed insurrection to seize leadership of revolutionary movements from the KMT. On 13 July, CPC issued a declaration that it would officially withdraw from the KMT, and reproached Wang as \\"openly sponsoring counter- revolutionaries\\". =Break with CPC and dissolution= Continuous unrest by trade unionists and communist-aligned peasant movements, along with Soviet interference in Wuhan's affairs, placed constant pressure on the Wuhan government, which subsequently moved to purge communists from its ranks on 15 July 1927, in what is known as the \\"715 Incident\\". In response to the purge, the Chinese Communist Party initiated the Nanchang uprising against the Wuhan government on 1 August 1927, after which Wuhan agreed to reunify with the Nanjing nationalist government. In return for his cooperation, Wang Jingwei demanded that Chiang resign from his post of commander-in-chief, and relinquish all political titles. Chiang accordingly resigned from his post on 12 August. On 21 September, the Wuhan Political Council made an official statement to the effect that they would relocate to Nanjing, ending the Wuhan government.  Military forces  Though most of the NRA was loyal to Chiang Kai-shek or various warlords who joined the KMT before or during the Northern Expedition, the Wuhan government commanded its own military force. The so- called \\"Wuhan Army\\" was less strong and well-armed than the rest of the NRA, and suffered from the defection of right-leaning commanders and their troops to Chiang's side. Commanded by Tang Shengzhi, the Wuhan army was too weak in numbers and equipment to truly rival Chiang's followers or to defeat the northern warlords. Nevertheless, a 70,000-strong army loyal to the Wuhan government launched its own \\"Northern Expedition\\" in April 1927, aiming to conquer Henan from the northern warlords. Though lacking in arms, this force was joined by deserters from Wu Peifu's forces and managed to push back the warlord Zhang Xueliang, but suffered 14,000 casualties while doing so, and was forced to return to Wuhan. Unable to sufficiently replenish its numbers, the Wuhan army was eventually defeated by Chiang-loyal NRA forces.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  In 1873, Sydney Harbour was found to be grossly polluted with water-borne diseases. After a severe outbreak of typhoid fever in 1875 the government created the Sydney City and Suburban Health Board to investigate an alternative means of disposing of the City's growing sewage waste. This led to the construction of the Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer (BOOS) in 1889 and the creation of the low level sewage pumping station system to transfer sewage against gravitation in low lying areas around the Harbour. Twenty Stations were built in the first generation of LLSPSs late in the 19th century, and in the subsequent development of other Ocean Outfall Sewers to serve the southern, western and northern suburbs, more than 115 pumping stations were in operation by the late 1950s'. The physical manifestations of the first 50 years of this system are the station superstructures, the majority of which are still functioning today. SPS27 itself was built in 1911-12 by the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage. It was decommissioned in 1997 after an investigation in the early 1990s revealed that the building was in poor condition and was \\"at the end of its useful life\\"; it was replaced by a new station on an adjacent site. Conservation works were undertaken in 2014, reflecting the site's heritage value.  Description  SPS 27 is conventional LLSPS with a concrete substructure and a single storey sandstone superstructure designed in Federation Romanesque. The structure was designed to be sympathetic with the nearby Kirdbridge block of the Callan Park Hospital. Externally, there is a hipped corrugated iron roof and a timber louvered ventilator; boxed eaves; random course picked sandstone walls; multi- paned timber framed fixed sash windows with multi-paned timber framed fixed sash windows with multi-paned fanlights and dressed sandstone surrounds. Entrance consists of a timber framed, ledged and sheeted double opening door with original hasp and staple, keeper and top/bottom bolts. Above the door is a recessed sandstone panel inscribed \\"MBWS & DB 1911\\". Rainwater goods consist of colourbond gutters and downpipe. Internally there are exposed timber trusses arranged in a cruciform pattern framing the ventilation shaft. Walls are of painted picked sandstone with rubbed sandstone door and window dressings. There is a brick dwarf wall with a 1.8m cyclone fence surrounding three sides of the site, fourth side is bounded by a natural sandstone outcrop. There is a small brick toilet enclosure adjacent to the building. Immediate area around the Station has been covered in concreted and the property overlooks Iron Cove. It is substantially intact however several unsympathetic alterations have taken place. A new colourbond roof replaces an original slate roofing. In general, the fabric is marred by a lack of maintenance. The Station has been decommissioned.  Heritage listing  SPS 27 is of historic and aesthetic significance at the local and state level. Its historic value is derived from its original function which was to serve the Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer (BOOS). The construction of the BOOS effectively ended the discharge of untreated sewage into Sydney Harbour. It is a rare example of the use of local sandstone as an architectural material in an industrial building designed by the Water Board, and was designed to lend stylistic continuity to the surrounding buildings in the Callan Park complex. In addition, the mechanical components housed within the building have potential industrial archaeological value. The Station is located within a small site adjacent to Eastern Park. The structure thus has a level of aesthetic value which is enhanced by its location in picturesque Iron Cove and contributes significantly to the visual catchment of the surrounding landscape. Sewage Pumping Station 27 was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.

In a series of bold and innovative arguments, he undermined the claims for Biblical authority which the opponents of Copernicus used. The letter was the subject of the first complaint about Galileo to the Inquisition in 1615. Background In 1610 Galileo had published Sidereus Nuncius (The Starry Messenger) which made him famous across Europe. This work prompted many debates as to whether the Earth really was the centre of the universe. Galileo usually avoided referring to scripture in his arguments about the universe, while the Aristotelian scholars who opposed Copernicus cited the Bible in support of their views - for example Lodovico delle Colombe in his 1611 work Contra il Moto della Terra (Against the Motion of the Earth) explicitly challenged anyone defending Copernicus to answer the charge that he was going against what the Bible taught. This presented Galileo with a dilemma - if he did not respond, he effectively conceded that the biblical text confirmed the Aristotelian view despite the fact that the Church had no firm position on the Copernican question; on the other hand if he tried to engage in arguments based on scripture, he allowed himself to be drawn into a field where the Church regarded its authority as absolute. Indeed an earlier venture into this form of argument by Galileo had been stopped by the Church. In the manuscript for Letters on Sunspots (1613), he argued that \\"flaws\\" in the Sun demonstrated that the heavens were not immutable, as had previously been thought. A paragraph in which Galileo supported this by claiming that the scriptures supported the mutability of the heavens was removed by the Inquisition censors. On 14 December 1613 Galileo's friend and former pupil Benedetto Castelli wrote to him to say that at a recent dinner in Pisa with the Grand Duke Cosimo II de' Medici a conversation had taken place in which Cosimo Boscaglia, a professor of philosophy, argued that the motion of the Earth could not be true, as it was contrary to the Bible. Castelli had disagreed with him and maintained, as Galileo held, that the Earth's motion was possible. After the dinner, Castelli had been called back by the Dowager Duchess Christina of Tuscany to answer points she raised from scriptural arguments against the motion of the Earth. Castelli had responded and Boscaglia had remained silent. Castelli wished to alert Galileo to this exchange, and advised Galileo that their mutual friend Niccol√≤ Arrighetti would come to Florence and explain matters further. This Arrighetti did. Galileo felt that it was important for him to set out an argument to show how scripture could not be used as the basis for scientific enquiry. He did so with great speed, replying with a letter to Castelli in less than a week, on 21 December 1613. His Letter to Benedetto Castelli was not published, but was circulated widely in manuscript form. As the debate about its arguments continued, Galileo thought it advisable to review and expand the arguments he had set out. This was the basis of his subsequent Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina, which expanded the eight pages of his letter to Castelli to forty pages. Key arguments In his letter to Benedetto Castelli, Galileo argues that using the Bible as evidence against the Copernican system involves three key errors. Firstly, claiming that the Bible shows the Earth to be static and concluding that the Earth therefore does not move is arguing from a false premise; whether the Earth moves or not is a thing which must be demonstrated (or not) through scientific enquiry. Secondly, the Bible is not even a source of authority on this kind of question, but only on matters of faith - thus if the Bible happens to say something about a natural phenomenon, this is not sufficient for us to say that it is so. Thirdly, he shows by deft argument that it is open to question whether the Bible, as his opponents claimed, even contradicted Copernicus' model of the universe. Indeed, Galileo argues, a key passage in the Bible which was held by his opponents to support the view that the Sun moves round the Earth supports his own views much better. In the Bible Joshua 10:12 is an account of how God commanded the Sun to stand still so that Joshua could defeat his enemies. According to those opposed to Copernicus, this showed clearly that the Sun (and not the Earth) moved. Galileo argued that this passage could not be used to support the traditional Earth-centred view of the universe at all. If we assume the universe to be as it was described by Claudius Ptolemy, the Sun's annual motion was a slow movement towards the East, so if God had commanded it to stop, the daily movement towards the West would no longer have been counteracted and as a result the day would actually have got slightly shorter rather than longer. However if we assume the universe to be as Copernicus described it, the Sun is at the centre and its rotation drives the rotation of all the planets. Thus if God had ordered the Sun to stop turning, everything would have stopped and the day would have been longer, just as the Bible described. Analysis Two aspects of Galileo's letter are particularly worthy of note. First, his boldness in venturing into the field of exegesis, where he was bound to upset many theologians who would not welcome his contributions. Second, his rhetorically brilliant argument was based on a fundamental contradiction; he began by arguing that faith and science were distinct, and that the Bible could not be used as the basis for arguments about science; he then went on to show, according to some novel and clever arguments, that actually the Bible supported his own scientific views. His letter argues a position on scriptural authority which is very similar in substance, if not in tone, to that set out set out by the Catholic Church itself centuries later, in Leo XIII's 1893 encyclical, Providentissimus Deus. Emphasising that the Bible makes use of figurative language and is not meant to teach science, this argues: > \\"...here is the rule also laid down by St. Augustine, for the theologian: > \\"Whatever they [i.e. scientists] can really demonstrate to be true of > physical nature, we [i.e. theologians] must show to be capable of > reconciliation with our Scriptures; and whatever they assert in their > treatises which is contrary to these Scriptures of ours, that is to Catholic > faith, we must either prove it as well as we can to be entirely false, or at > all events we must, without the smallest hesitation, believe it to be so.\\" Likewise, Galileo accepted that the Bible was infallible in matters of doctrine, but he agreed with Cardinal Baronius's observation that it was \\"intended to teach us how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go.\\" He also pointed out that both St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas had taught that scripture had not been written to teach a system of astronomy, citing St. Augustine‚Äôs comment that \\"One does not read in the Gospel that the Lord said: I will send you the Paraclete who will teach you about the course of the sun and moon. For He willed to make them Christians, not mathematicians.\\" The Roman Inquisition In late 1614 or early 1615, Niccol√≤ Lorini obtained a copy of Galileo's letter, some parts of which he and his fellow Dominicans at the convent of San Marco in Florence adjudged to be \\"suspect or rash\\". He therefore forwarded it to Cardinal Paolo Emilio Sfondrati at the Congregation of the Index, together with a covering letter dated 7 February 1615, calling for the matter to be investigated. The Holy Office examined Lorini's copy of Galileo's letter to Castelli on 25 February 1615 at the house of Robert Bellarmine. It was clear to them that Lorini's version was not the complete letter, as it was obvious that an introductory section was missing. Lorini's version also included the phrase 'Scripture does not refrain from perverting its most important dogmas...' whereas Galileo's original had said 'Scripture accommodates itself to the capacity of uncouth and uneducated people'. For whatever reason, the Holy Office wished to make certain that it had an accurate version before proceeding with its investigation, so Cardinal Garzia Mellini, secretary of the Inquisition, wrote to the archbishop of Pisa, where Castelli taught at the university, and asked him to provide the original letter. By now Galileo had apparently realised that some kind of investigation was underway, so he asked Castelli to return the original of the letter to him. He made a copy of it and sent this version to his friend Archbishop Piero Dini in Rome, protesting at the ‚Äúwickedness and ignorance‚Äù of his enemies, and expressing concern that the Inquisition ‚Äúmay be in part deceived by this fraud which is going around under the cloak of zeal and charity‚Äù. The Holy Office submitted Galileo's letter to an unnamed theological adviser for examination. That adviser's report, undated, concluded that there were three places where Galileo had used language which was offensive, but 'although this document sometimes uses words improperly, it does not deviate from the narrow path of Catholic expression.' Discovery of the original manuscript Until 2018 two versions existed of the Letter to Bedenetto Castelli - the Lorini version held in the Vatican archives and the Dini version. The general scholarly view was that Lorini‚Äôs version was not authentic and that Lorini had amended it to show Galileo in the worst possible light, while the Dini version was generally held to be true. In August 2018 the original manuscript of the letter was discovered in the archives of the Royal Society. This is the letter Galileo sent to Castelli and later asked Castelli to return to him. It shows the edits Galileo made in his own handwriting as he prepared the Dini version, replacing words and phrases that the Inquisition might object to with words less likely to offend. None of the arguments were changed, but the tone of the letter was altered considerably. It is thus certain that the Lorini version was in most respects authentic, while the Dini version was not, as Galileo claimed, a true copy of his original letter.

Having been elected member of Surakarta's city council by 1985, he also served a year at the People's Representative Council before becoming mayor. He would lose his re-election to Joko Widodo, and get convicted of corruption. He died in 2018 due to stroke. Early life He was born in Ponorogo on 1 November 1944, during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia. He later studied at Surakarta's state-funded educational institute (IKIP Negeri Surakarta), graduating in 1970. He later studied at Jakarta's National Defense Institute (Lemhanas) in 2001. Career He had led the Banjarsari subdistrict office of PDI-P as early as 1980, with him being elected to the city council in 1985 and becoming the party's head for the city in 1999. According to F.X. Hadi Rudyatmo, Suryanto had strongly defended Megawati Sukarnoputri during a schism of the Indonesian Democratic Party. Later, he was elected to the People's Representative Council in the 1999 election, though he resigned after just one year. He ran for mayor of Surakarta in 2000. Despite being a popular figure there, he could not secure an endorsement from PDI-P city councilors, with only 9 of 23 backing him (executive elections prior to 2004 were done by legislators and not through a popular vote). However, he managed to convince other members of the council, including his later-deputy J. Soeprapto, to support him, and hence secured the mayoral seat. During his time as mayor, he reconstructed Surakarta's city hall, which was burnt down in 1999 by a mob following Megawati's defeat in the 1999 presidential vote. He became a suspect of a corruption case in 2004 for three projects rife with fake/manipulated budgets, including the city hall's construction. In 2005, Suryanto failed to secure the endorsement of PDI-P for his reelection, who instead had supported the Joko Widodo/F.X. Hadi Rudyatmo ticket. Suryanto ran anyway, with the support of a coalition of minor parties. For this action, he was penalized by PDI-P. He lost in the election, only winning about 5 percent of votes with Widodo coming on top with around 35 percent. After his defeat, he was sentenced to 15 months in prison for the city hall's graft case in January 2007. Although the Supreme Court upheld the decision in July 2008, further prosecution of his cases was postponed in 2010 due to his deteriorating health. Death He died on 3 April 2018, at around 19:00 local time, due to stroke. He was laid in state at the Surakarta City Hall prior to him being buried in Banjarsari's Bonoloyo funeral.

Inspired by a real-life pandemic of mass frog deformities discovered in Minnesota, the plot of Strange Nature follows a former pop star (Lisa Sheridan) and her young son (Jonah Beres) moving to rural Minnesota to reconnect with her estranged father (Bruce Bohne), only to find themselves in danger when the mutations begin infecting animals and humans. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Stephen Tobolowsky, Carlos Alazraqui, John Hennigan, and Tiffany Shepis. Shot in Minnesota in the summer of 2014, Strange Nature spent several years in post-production before making its theatrical debut in September 2018, where it was met with mixed critical reviews. Plot Based on a true unsolved ecological mystery, thousands of hideously deformed frogs have turned up in the waters of Minnesota. As seen through the eyes of a one-hit wonder, single mother and her 11-year-old son, a small town struggles with the unknown when the deadly mutations move beyond the ponds.

These deformities typically consisted of missing or extra limbs, misplaced eyes, misshapen jaws, and spinal defects, among other conditions. By 1996, mutated frogs had been reported in 35 US states and three Canadian provinces, including nearly three-quarters of Minnesota's 87 counties. From 1998 to 2000, the Minnesota governor and legislature gave the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency funding to study frog deformities, and they worked closely with scientists and researchers from the University of Minnesota, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the United States Geological Survey, the National Wildlife Health Center, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to investigate the problem. Despite this, no conclusive answer as to what was causing the deformities was found, and in July 2001, funding for the study was withdrawn. Production Writer-director Jim Ojala, a native of Duluth, Minnesota, followed the events of the frog mutations as they occurred; as he recalled in a 2018 interview, \\"seeing these wild mutant looking frogs on the front page of your local newspaper totally felt like sci-fi/horror come to life\\". As Ojala progressed in his career as a filmmaker and special-effects artist and populations of deformed frogs continued to grow worldwide, he drew upon the mutations as the basis for his feature-film debut, surprised that a movie or documentary had never been made about the subject. Ojala wrote the screenplay for Strange Nature in the early- to-mid-2000s, and has cited William Souder's 2000 non-fiction book A Plague of Frogs as a major source of the movie's scientific facts and theories. During preproduction, Ojala consulted with several leading ecologists on the deformed frog phenomenon, one of whom was so supportive of the film that they supplied the production with actual deformed frogs that were used in several scenes. According to Ojala, he pitched Strange Nature as \\"Erin Brockovich...with monsters\\". Several producers initially showed interest in the project, though many of them voiced skepticism over Ojala's insistence on shooting in and using cast and crew from Minnesota, preferring to film in more commonly used locations such as Louisiana or Bulgaria. Some producers felt at odds with the unusual dramatic and realism ground tone of the script and requested rewrites to fit more conventional horror or science-fiction tropes: \\"One producer said I should end the movie with the reason for the deformities being aliens\\", Ojala recalled, \\"I never talked to that producer again\\". To retain more creative control over the film, a Kickstarter campaign was launched to help independently finance a portion of Strange Nature, setting a goal of $45,000. Due to Ojala's reputation in the film industry as a special-effects artist, the campaign was promoted by such prominent horror publication as Fangoria and successfully met its goal, raising a total of $46,088. Casting for Strange Nature took place between June and July 2014, with several principal roles filled by local Minnesota actors. For the role of Mayor Paulson, Ojala extended offers to numerous high-profile actors, including Kurt Russell and John Goodman - \\"people we had no business talking to\\", he mused, \\"at least we tried\\". Ultimately, the part went to veteran character actor Stephen Tobolowsky, who was \\"excited\\" to take on the role, as he felt the character was written realistically, rather than as a villainous archetype. Principal photography took place over 19 days in August 2014 throughout Minnesota, primarily Duluth and parts of rural Itasca County. Ojala recounted the shoot as being \\"quite difficult\\", noting a \\"grueling\\" schedule, a lack of cellphone and computer communications in their remote locations, and the complications of breaking \\"every rule in the indie film book: we had tons of locations, tons of characters, makeup/creature effects, stunts, puppets, animals, kids, even a newborn baby\\". Ojala likened it to \\"figuring out how to make a feature like it was the early 90s\\". Actor John Hennigan admitted that though the intense filming conditions were often tough, the experience was an overall positive one. \\"The sense of camaraderie after finishing this project was really rewarding\\", he told Digital Journal, \\"and the bond you have with the people may last for years, or sometimes a lifetime\\". With the majority of filming completed in Minnesota, several pick-ups and more intricate special-effects shots were finished in Los Angeles. In a November 29, 2015, post on the official Strange Nature Facebook page, these inserts were announced to have been completed and the film was \\"100% in the can\\". Updates on Strange Natures postproduction status were sporadically shared on the movie's social media until June 20, 2017, when work on film was finally announced to be complete. Release and reception The first teaser trailer for Strange Nature was released on July 24, 2015. As postproduction continued throughout 2016 and into 2017, the film began to generate internet buzz among horror and indie film websites. Moviepilot placed Strange Nature on their list of \\"10 Indie Horror Films Coming Out in 2017 You Don't Want to Miss\\", while humor website Cracked.com put it on their fall 2017 list of \\"Crazy-Looking Movies You've Never Heard Of\\", describing the film as \\"It's like Jaws, but if the shark was a frog. What's not to fucking love?\\". The final trailer was released on December 22, 2017 and was featured on several prominent film websites, including Dread Central and JoBlo.coms Arrow in the Head. Strange Nature had its official premiere at Los Angeles' Laemmle Glendale Theatre on September 22, 2018, which then ran for an exclusive week-long engagement. In October, the film was to be screened as part of the Great Western Catskills International Film Festival in Andes, New York, followed by theatrical runs in Duluth and St. Louis Park, Minnesota. A video on demand, Redbox, and Amazon release was planned for the fall. On the prospect of a sequel, Ojala remarked in an interview with HorrorNews.net, \\"we want to see how the film does and we leave it open-ended where there could absolutely be a sequel\\". =Critical reception= Strange Nature received mixed reviews from critics. It holds an approval rating of 43% on the aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes, based on seven reviews, with an average rating of 4.35/10. Freddy Beans of Ain't It Cool News called it an \\"awesome little horror gem\\" and a \\"brilliant freshman effort\\" for director Ojala, commending the \\"fantastic\\" cinematography and creature effects and concluding \\"I can't explain how much I really enjoyed my time watching this unique experience\\". Horror magazine Rue Morgue delivered most of its praise onto the film's ensemble cast, namely its \\"three- dimensional characterizations\\" and Lisa Sheridan's performance, describing the overall film as \\"[weaving] threads of Erin Brockovich, It's Alive, and Cabin Fever into a quirky, nasty, sometimes inspiring tapestry of unlikely-hero- vs.-enviro-terror\\". The Los Angeles Times was slightly more ambivalent, feeling the film lacked scares but nevertheless praised the \\"top-notch\\" creature effects and \\"likeable characters\\", complimenting the small town \\"slice of life\\" angle and giving Ojala \\"kudos\\" for \\"making his setting essential to his story\\". FanSideds Hidden Remote, titling their review with \\"science-fiction meets real science in perfect blend\\", appreciated the film's environmental messages, acknowledging Ojala for \\"[presenting] all these issues in an entertaining fashion\\" as well as noting the \\"phenomenal\\" chemistry between the ensemble cast. Horror Fuel awarded Strange Nature a perfect rating of 5 stars, applauding the depth and relatability of the characters, writing \\"everything just congeals into a highly effective, borderline realistic, terror tale that is as disturbing (and trust me it gets very disturbing) as it is engaging\\". 28 Days Later Analysis lauded the \\"compelling\\" and \\"well-drawn\\" characters, \\"excellent\\" make-up effects and the film's use of dark humor, stating \\"Strange Nature offers a lot in its short, but bloody runtime\\" and \\"indie horror fans should see this production\\". Bobby LePire of Film Threat gave the film a negative review, stating \\"The directing style of Strange Nature fails to bring any atmosphere, the acting is so nondescript that it barely registers (with two notable exceptions), and a lack of cohesive vision leaves the movie uncertain of what it truly is. An absolute waste of time for all involved, especially the audience.\\" Although he panned most performances, including Sheridan's, whom he called \\"an entirely blank slate\\", he did praise the performances of Stephen Tobolowsky and John Hennigan. Chloe Leeson of Screen Queen gave a similarly negative review, stating \\"Whilst there are some more intriguing loose ends that never come to fruition (largely wondering what happens to the people who go missing in the woods?) in favour of a shoed-in romance and loose emotional connections between various mediocre characters, Strange Nature is ultimately the creation of a first-time director - lots of promising ideas, but not enough editing. Achievements in campy creature fun and practical effects that horror fans love might not be enough to keep audiences in seats past an unstable first hour.\\" References External links *Official website * Category:2010s monster movies Category:2018 independent films Category:2018 films Category:2018 thriller films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American monster movies Category:American natural horror films Category:American thriller films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in Minnesota Category:Films shot in Minnesota ","title":"Strange Nature (film)"},{"id":"58598431","text":"Mar√≠a del Carmen Serd√°n Alatriste (1875 in Puebla de Zaragoza, Puebla ‚Äì August 28, 1948) was a Mexican revolutionary. She shared the ideas of the Mexican Revolution and sympathized with Emilio Madero. She was the sister of Aquiles Serd√°n Alatriste, also a revolutionary, and granddaughter of Miguel C√°stulo Alatriste Castro, who served as the Liberal governor of the state of Puebla from 1857 to 1861. Early life Daughter of the lawyer Manuel Serd√°n Guanes (1843-1880, editor of the People's Law, the first agrarian reform plan in the country), and Mar√≠a del Carmen Alatriste Cuesta (1849-?), Was sister of Natalia (1875-1938), Aquiles (1877-1910) and M√°ximo Serd√°n Alatriste (1879-1910).  Path  She worked with her brother Aquiles (both belonged to the National Anti-reelectionist Party (later the Progressive Constitutional Party) , founded by her and Francisco I. Madero ) during the campaign in favor of the latter, who opposed the regime of Porfirio D√≠az. The 18 of November of 1910, her family residence was attacked by the federal army and was about to be searched by the police chief Miguel Cabrera. The Serd√°n family resisted, while her brother Maximus barricaded himself on the roof. Mar√≠a del Carmen exhorted the population from a balcony of her house. She was wounded and captured. She was sent to the prison of La Merced and later to the municipal hospital of San Pedro (see Royal Hospital of San Pedro or Temple of the Ex- Hospital of San Pedro and San Pedro Art Museum). When Victoriano Huerta's term ended, she worked in various hospitals as a nurse. She lived her last years in her hometown and died on August 28, 1948. She was a contributor to the satirical magazine El Hijo del Ahuizote and the newspaper Diario del Hogar. Carmen Serd√°n was one of the few women who spread the Diaz - Creelman interview (es) (which detonated the situation that would end up generating the Mexican Revolution) in gazettes and meetings. She founded and was part of the Revolutionary Junta de Puebla. She organized the reception for Francisco I. Madero in Puebla, in the company of a group of women from that city, with whom she carried out anti-reelectionist propaganda actions. Madero proposed to the group a policy of equality in work and pay. The group was joined by Sara P√©rez Romero, the candidate's wife. The 20 of November of 1910, Carmen Serd√°n was in charge of the logistics of the revolutionary movement in the state of Puebla state. In those days, she used a code language of her invention and a pseudonym, \\"Marcos Serrato\\", to exchange, through several newspapers, messages with her brother Aquiles, who was in San Antonio, Texas. While the men were being watched by the government of Mucio P. Mart√≠nez, the women of the so- called Feminine Club were in charge of the war preparations and of spreading the San Luis Plan, which indicated the steps to follow in the armed uprising. Acknowledgments In her memory, several schools (kindergartens, primary and secondary), houses of culture, markets, libraries, colonies and sports facilities in Mexico are named after her.

The school hosts more than 1,200 students across over 70 nationalities, and offers a multilingual curriculum in the form of the International Baccalaureate programme for Pre-KG to Grade 12. It includes boarding houses that cater to ages 11-17, offering full-time, weekly, and flexi-boarding options.  History  SISD was founded by Omar Danial, co-owner of Swiss hotel group Manotel and President and major shareholder of investment company Finial Capital SA. Danial had moved to Dubai in 2010 with his family, and originally intended to found a school for the hospitality industry. However, upon arrival, Danial found that the overall educational presence of the International Baccalaureate programme in the area was lacking. As many European expatriates were starting to arrive and work in the region, he consulted contacts in the Swiss education field for advice in how to create an educational institution based on the Swiss educational system. Danial founded the school in 2012 through personal investments, a local bank, and the backing of the prominent Seddiqi family, who are among the co-founders of the school.  Curriculum  SISD implements the International Baccalaureate curriculum in the form of the IB Primary Years Programme, IB Middle Years Programme, IB Diploma Programme, and Career-related Programme. SISD is Dubai‚Äôs first private school to offer multilingual education in French, English, German and Arabic. The school offers three different study streams: English+ with additional languages (Arabic and French or German) and personalised STEAM programme from Pre-KG to Grade 5; bilingual English-French; and English-German. In the 2018 school year, SISD began a trial implementation of Common Sense Media‚Äôs Digital Citizenship curriculum, aiming to better equip students for life in an increasingly digital world. In the 2020 school year, SISD enhanced the Early Years and Primary School English+ programme by integrating transdisciplinary Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics education into the curriculum. The enhanced programme conforms to the IB curriculum, while including STEAM lessons which conform to technology education standards such as the Next Generation Science Standards, International Standards for Technology Education and UNESCO Education for Sustainable Development. In June 2020, SISD was authorised to offer the International Baccalaureate Career-related Programme (IBCP). The IBCP is the newest addition to the International Baccalaureate continuum. Designed for students aged 16-19 who wish to engage in career-related education, the IBCP allows students to deepen their understanding in general areas of knowledge, engaging in a holistic education model that fosters an enthusiasm for lifelong learning. = Facilities = SISD features several facilities that are open to students and boarding house occupants, both during school and after school hours. The Innovation Labs support STEM education and contain equipment for programming, robotics, app development, 3D printing, and design. There are also music and dance studios, as well as art and design rooms. The school also provides access to sports facilities such as tennis and basketball courts, an Olympic swimming pool, soccer fields, and a gym.

As a relative of Brag and Poch, from which the game of Poker developed, it is of cultural-historical interest. Parlett records it as Best, Flush and Thirty- One.  Rules  The game is played with a pack of 52 French playing cards; in addition three coin dishes are needed for the stakes. Before the start of the game, each player puts an agreed amount of money into each of the three dishes. Like Poch, Belle, Flux et Trente-et-Un is a compound game of 3 parts, hence the names Dreisatz (\\"Triple Set\\") and Les Trois Jeux (\\"The Three Games\\"). = Belle = Once the stakes have been placed, each player is dealt 2 cards, face down, and 1 card, face up. The player who has the highest upcard, the so-called Belle, wins the first deal and the contents of the first dish. The ranking of the cards is as follows (c.f. √âcart√©): :King - Queen - Jack - Ace (!) - Ten - Nine - ... - Two If there is no clear winner, then Forehand, the player who is next to deal, wins. = Flux = In the second deal, Flux (also Fluxus, c.f. flush), the winner is the player who has the highest-value flush. A flush is a hand of three cards of the same suit. If no player has a flush, the stakes remain in the dish for the next game. If two or more players have a flush, the card points are added and the highest-value flush wins. For this, the Aces counts as 11 points, the court cards) 10 each, and the pip cards score from 2 to 9 depending on their natural value. If there is a tie, the same rule applies as in Belle: forehand wins. Unlike the game of Poch, there is no betting on the highest combination, as subsequently became typical for Poker. There is also no option to bluff. = Trente-et-Un = Finally, in the third deal each player attempts, by exchanging cards, to score 31 points, or to get as close to 31 points as possible (c.f. Vingt-et-Un, and the third round of Brag). The player who comes closest to 31, wins the contents of the third dish. If there is a tie, forehand wins. The modern casino game of Black Jack was developed from this contract via Trente-et-Un and Vingt-et-Un.

The dam was designed and built in 1907 by the NSW Department of Public Works. The dam's purpose includes is primarily for the potable water supply of the upper Blue Mountains region. The impounded reservoir is called Medlow Bath Reservoir. The dam is also known as Medlow Bath Dam, Lake Medlow Dam, Adams Creek Dam and Medlow Bath Reservoir. The property is owned by Sydney Water, a state-owned corporation of the Government of New South Wales. The dam was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  Medlow Dam is a thin-wall arch concrete dam constructed by the Public Works Department of NSW in 1907, for water supply to nearby townships and possibly also for ornamental purposes. Control was vested in Municipality of Blackheath in 1940, then transferred to the MWS&DB; in 1980. Water supply was first furnished to Medlow Bath in 1907 and subsequently extended to Blackheath, Megalong and Mount Victoria. Medlow Dam is one of the series of so-called \\"Wade Dams\\", constructed in the late years of the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth century by the NSW Public Works Department under the supervision and/or design of Mr L. A. B. Wade, for water supply to country towns. They were remarkable in pioneering the general use of thin-arch concrete walls under high stresses. It is claimed that this dam, when constructed, was the thinnest of its type in the world and the basic design attracted grave misgivings in the engineering world. Both this dam and a similar example at Lithgow are recognised in the standard engineering work \\"A History of Dams\\" as world leaders in dam design and construction and they excite continuing engineering interest for the thinness of their wall section. It is stated in the 1909 Institution of Civil Engineers paper that Mr C. W. Darley, Engineer in Chief of Public Works, was responsible for initiating the construction of this type of dam in Australia and for the completion of the earlier structures. The paper's author (L. A. B. Wade) acted under Mr Darley as Supervisor of Works and subsequently succeeding to the latter's position, was responsible for the design as well as construction of the Lithgow No. 2, Katoomba and Medlow dams. The thirteen dams of this type were built of concrete (not reinforced), curved in plan, reliance for stability being placed only on the capacity of the material in the wall and sides of the valley to resist compression. In designing these dams, the complex question of the exact stresses that may occur and the assistance that may be afforded by the weight of the wall was disregarded; as it was considered that all practical requirements would be met if in theory the dams were treated simply as sections of rigid cylinders subject to exterior water pressure. The radius of this cylinder depended upon the natural features of the sites, it being stated elsewhere in the paper that the use of such curved walls was restricted to comparatively narrow valleys and gorges. This local (and as it turned out, entirely successful) design followed an earlier and perhaps even bolder 1884 precedent at the Bear Valley Dam in California but it led, as had the Californian work, to a storm of criticism from the engineering profession of the day, not least, because it had proved to be successful in the face of orthodox theory, which at that time concentrated on gravity dam walls. Comments of members of the Institution in 1909 included: Even the eminent Sir Alexander Binnie, Past President of the Institution, was moved to remark that \\"to look at the cross sections produced a blood-curdling sensation\\". He went on, however, to support the design as a practical achievement: it was not a matter of cavilling at theory or formulas; the dams were built and were standing. The problem that now arose was for mathematicians to show how the strains were accommodated in such apparently narrow walls. The entire justification of this then-daring and unorthodox design was economic. As stated by its originator, Mr Darley: small towns could not afford expensive gravity dams, and therefore it was a case of either building a cheap dam or not giving a water supply.  Description  Medlow Dam is a small water storage dam which utilises a thin-arch concrete wall under high stress. Its design capacity for the reservoir is , with a wall height (maximum) of . The radius of curvature for the dam wall is , the length of the wall is and the thickness of the wall at its top is . It remains in everyday use for the purpose for which it was designed. It is built of concrete (not reinforced), curved in plan, with reliance for stability being placed only on the capacity of the material in the wall and sides of the valley to resist compression. Associated with the dam is a small corrugated iron clad pumping shed, which contained three pumps. In 1993, these were rated as being of some significance, with two dating from 1927 and the third from the mid-1930s. = Condition = As at 24 September 2008, the Medlow Dam is intact and in good condition. = Modifications and dates = *1993 - Calcite deposits were removed from the downstream face using high pressure water jets. *2008 - Trunnion winch was replaced and the original winch moved to the side of the carpark for interpretive purposes.  Heritage listing  As at 26 August 2009, the Medlow Dam was the first of the water supply dams built as part of the development of the Upper Blue Mountains and is an important example of the \\"Wade\\" series of dams erected in NSW between the 1890s and early 1900s for NSW country town water supplies which utilised a concrete arch wall. It is associated with the NSW Department of Public Works and its design is a product of the work of two of Australia's leading engineers, L. A. B. Wade and C. W. Darley. The Medlow Dam was a world leader in the development of thin-walled concrete arch dams and created considerable controversy when completed, reputedly having the thinnest wall of any comparable dam in the world. It remains a textbook example of this form of design and construction. The completion of the Medlow Dam was a significant step in the process of providing a reliable water supply for Medlow Bath, Blackheath and the surrounding areas. Medlow Dam was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

It remains a textbook example of this form of design and construction. The completion of the Medlow Dam was a significant step in the process of providing a reliable water supply for Medlow Bath, Blackheath and the surrounding areas. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Medlow Dam is a simple and attractive construction, located in a picturesque setting. It is an excellent example of a thin-walled concrete arch dam. The thinness of the wall sections provides a spectacular appreciation of the engineering behind the design of the dam. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Medlow Dam is of significance to the engineering profession, as evidenced by its listing in the Engineering Heritage Register of NSW (1994). The Medlow Dam is of significance to the community of NSW, as evidenced by its inclusion in the National Trust of Australia (NSW) Register (1985). The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Medlow Dam represents the thinnest thin-walled concrete arch dam erected in Australia and both individually and collectively, as one of a number of dams built in NSW in the early twentieth century which utilise a similar design and similar materials, it provides continuous data as to the long-term performance of this type of dam construction. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Medlow Dam was the first of the water supply dams built as part of the development of the Upper Blue Mountains. The Medlow Dam was a world leader in the development of thin-walled concrete arch dams and had the thinnest wall of any comparable dam in the world at the time that it was built. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Medlow Dam is representative of the \\"Wade\\" series of dams erected in NSW between the 1890s and early 1900s for NSW country town water supplies which utilised a thin concrete arch wall, although it is a notable example of that set.

History  Due to its rebellious instability originating from the Venezuelan War of Independence, the confederation existed in three different stages depending on territory held by revolutionary or royalist forces. These are commonly known as the First Republic of Venezuela, Second Republic of Venezuela and the Third Republic of Venezuela. = First Republic of Venezuela = On 19 April 1810, the municipal council of Caracas deposed the Spanish Governor and Captain General, Vicente Empar√°n. The Supreme Junta was then established in Caracas, with civil war soon sparking throughout much of the Venezuelan territory. As the congress of the Junta gathered, a movement for independence gained popular support. Revolutionaries such as Francisco de Miranda, a Venezuelan expatriate, and Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, a Criollo aristocrat, led the independence movement. The Junta's congress declared Venezuela's independence on 5 July 1811, with seven of ten regions of the Captaincy General of Venezuela seceding and establishing the Confederaci√≥n Americana de Venezuela (American Confederation of Venezuela). The first actions by the revolutionary government involved the creation of free trade within Venezuela, which consolidated power among the upper-class aristocrats which led the confederation. Shortly after the establishment of the confederation, royalist sympathizers within the revolutionary territory began to plot the reinstallation of Spanish power in the region. Royalists began promising freedom and rights to black slaves, who held contempt toward the Criollo aristocrats who held power during the confederation.POUNDENX, H, M√©moire pour servir √† l'Histoire de la R√©volution de la Capitainerie G√©n√©rale de Caracas.

Paris, 1825 However, attempts to reestablish Spanish rule initially failed. = Second Republic of Venezuela = Beginning in early 1813, revolutionaries again attempted to establish a republic within Venezuela independent from Spain. Leading the Admirable Campaign, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var organized troops from the United Provinces of New Granada to capture territory within Venezuela. Bol√≠var published the Decree of War to the Death on 15 June 1813, which resulted in the executions and killings of thousands of opponents to the revolution, including hospitalized individuals.Misael Pacheco Loma (1965).

Beginning in February 1814, royalist commander Jos√© Tom√°s Boves began a campaign to retake Venezuelan territory captured by revolutionaries, beginning the decline of the Second Republic of Venezuela. Following the Second Battle of La Puerta on 15 June 1814 which resulted in a royalist victory for Boves, Bol√≠var, his revolutionaries and more than twenty-thousand civilians fled Caracas during the Emigration to the East beginning on 7 July 1814.Cr√≥nica razonada de las..., pp. 573; Encina, 1961: 403Psuv El Hatillo Memoria hist√≥rica. \\"Se inicia la emigraci√≥n de Oriente\\". Following the royalist victory in the Fifth Battle of Matur√≠n on 11 December 1814, the republic came to an end and Bol√≠var left to Jamaica. = Third Republic of Venezuela = In 1816, Bol√≠var returned to liberate New Grenada and Venezuela. The Expedition of the Keys, led by Bol√≠var in the west, began the revolutionary push eastward. The Guayana Campaign, headed by Manuel Piar and others to the east, led to the establishment of institutions in Angostura in 1817, with the period of the Third Republic of Venezuela beginning at this time. The period of the Third Republic came to an end in February 1819 during the Congress of Angostura, which eventually resulted with the establishment of Gran Colombia.

In her early years as a singer Tubb made a small number of recordings, which include \\"Ocean, thou mighty monster\\" from Weber's Oberon; Arensky's \\"Dream Waltz\\"; excerpts from Mendelssohn's Elijah; and from Sullivan's The Golden Legend; and popular ballads such as \\"Queen of the Roses; Lilac Time\\", \\"Gretna Green\\" and \\"Red rose of England\\". Tubb married Alexander John Ede Oliveira (d. 1936); they had one son. She retired from singing in or around 1930 and was a professor at the Guildhall School until 1958. On her hundredth birthday she was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Music, and Sir Adrian Boult conducted a concert given in her honour by the college's orchestra.\\"Miss Carrie Tubb\\", The Times, 22 September 1976, p. 20 Tubb died in London, aged 100.

It is best known for providing the \\"CSCS card\\", a widely recognised smart card providing evidence of a level of health and safety training relevant to the industry. There are more than 1.6 million CSCS card holders. The scheme has recently moved away from providing cards to unqualified persons and is increasing the minimum level of qualification required to hold a card.  History  The Construction Skills Certification Scheme was founded as a limited company on 21 February 1995. It issues photographic smart cards to construction workers as proof of training and qualification. The original aim of the scheme was to ensure that all construction workers in the UK receive training and achieve qualifications suitable to their role and have a means of proving this. From 1997 the scheme has been administered by the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB). However in December 2017 the CITB notified CSCS that it no longer wanted the contract and CSCS would need an alternative supplier at the end of the 42 month notification period. In the mid 2000s a spate of deaths in the construction industry led to the threat of government action on major contractors. As a result many of them decided to move to a so-called \\"100% carded\\" policy whereby every worker or visitor to site was required to hold a CSCS card as proof of a level of health and safety competence. This was initially welcomed by CSCS as it led to a rapid growth in the number of cards issued. The majority of the new cards were for the \\"construction site operative\\" and the \\"construction related occupation\\" categories ‚Äì requiring no qualifications but passing a simple touchscreen health and safety test. New cards were also introduced for workers not covered by existing categories, going so far as to include a specific card for vending machine installers. By 2012 half of all cards issued were in the operative category and 25% were for construction related operations. As these were non-qualified roles the scheme had drifted away from one of its key original objectives ‚Äì providing recognition for construction qualifications ‚Äì and was seen merely as a \\"hoop that had to be jumped through to get workers onto site\\". In addition to the workers cards many contractors required visitors to have a CSCS card also, this led to the introduction of a visitors category ‚Äì for which 120,000 cards were issued, far more than had ever been intended. The CSCS scheme is supported by the Construction Leadership Council who specified in 2015 that the industry should not accept any skills cards that were not affiliated with the scheme ‚Äì its so called \\"One Industry Logo\\" initiative. Affiliated schemes include the Construction Plant Competence Scheme and the Construction Industry Scaffolders Record Scheme. The CSCS schemes handle 400,000 applications and one million enquiries each year. there were more than 1.6 million card holders. The CSCS company board has representatives from client and contractor trade bodies as well as employee trade unions. In 2012, Graham Wren joined CSCS as chief executive and decided to move the scheme back towards a focus on qualifications. One of the first steps was taken in 2014 with the discontinuation of the operatives card and its replacement by a labourers card which required a level 1 qualification (all existing cards will expire by 2019). The \\"related occupations\\" card, of which 350,000 were in circulation, was discontinued in March 2017 with all cards set to expire by 2022. The visitors card, the last remaining non-qualified category, will be withdrawn on 28 February 2020 with all cards issued before then set to expire by August 2020. In the view of CSCS many of the unqualified card holders should never have needed cards anyway as they do not work in construction-related occupations. CSCS is seeking to move towards a minimum of a level 2 National Vocational Qualification to qualify for a skilled occupations card and is working with the Construction Industry Training Board to ensure a relevant qualification exists for each category of card. The company hopes that restricting the issuance of cards will lead to a move away from 100% card access construction sites and lead to contractors focussing on providing suitable inductions to non-qualified persons and providing them with adequate supervision.

It is at the end of a peninsula in the Kaipara Harbour, bounded by inlets to the Paparoa Creek to the west and the Pahi River to the east. Paparoa is 6 km to the north, and Matakohe is 4 km to the north-west. Pahi was one of several Kaipara settlements established by a religious group known as Albertlanders. Port Albert near Wellsford was the main settlement, and Matakohe was another. After the Paparoa Block was settled in 1863, a road was constructed to the port at Pahi in 1865. The steamer Minnie Casey ran a weekly service from Pahi to Helensville on the south side of the Kaipara from 1882, and the S.S. Ethel took over from 1891‚Äì95, after which services went only to Matakohe and Pahi. Pahi is best known for its annual regatta; the Pahi Regatta Club was established in 1887, and a regatta has been held every year except 1925. Taking place over three days, events included sailing and later motorboat races, children's sports, foot races, aquatic events, rowing, and horse- swimming races across the strait to Whakapirau and back. Horse-swimming races ceased after a horse and rider drowned.

She lives in Allahabad (Uttar Pradesh) and New Delhi in North India. Rai mainly writes and publishes short stories in Hindi. Written in a reflective prose style, her stories explore the individual complexities in the lives of ordinary people and outsiders in contemporary India.  Personal Background  Sara Rai was born into a family of writers and artists based in Allahabad. Sara Rai's grandfather is the writer Dhanpat Rai Srivastava, better known by his pen name Munshi Premchand (Mun≈õƒ´ Premcand). His second wife, Shivrani Devi (≈öivrƒÅnƒ´ Devƒ´, ?-1976), who was an active follower of Mahatma Gandhi, authored a memoir about her life with Premchand titled \\"Premcand ghar me·πÉ\\" (\\"Premchand at home\\", 1944). Sara Rai's father, the literary critic and painter Sripat Rai (≈örƒ´pat RƒÅy, 1916-1994), was the founding editor of Kahani (KahƒÅnƒ´, 1937‚Äì39 and 1953‚Äì79), one of the leading literary journals of the Nayi Kahani (Nayƒ´ KahƒÅnƒ´) Movement. Her mother, Zahra Rai (Zahra æ RƒÅy,1917-1993), also wrote and published short stories in Hindi. In her essay \\"You will be the Katherine Mansfield of Hindi\\", Sara Rai reflects her struggle of becoming a writer and finding her own literary voice in the multilingual and -cultural backgrounds of both her family and her home town Allahabad.  Education and Career  Sara Rai received a master's degree in Modern History from the Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, in 1978. Three years later, she accomplished her masters in English Literature at the University of Allahabad. Rai started writing at a young age. Her first story \\"Lucky Horace\\" was published in the Damn You magazine founded and edited by Arvind Krishna Mehrotra and Sara's cousins Alok and Amit Rai in the early 1960s. Since the early 1990s, Rai has been working as a translator of fiction by Vinod Kumar Shukla, Premchand, Pankaj Bisht, Shaukat Hayat, Geetanjali Shree and others from Hindi and Urdu into English. She also translated a number of her own short stories into English. Besides, Rai took part in some film and theatre projects: She wrote the dialogues for the experimental Bombay documentary \\"Seven Islands and a Metro\\" (2004), directed by Madusree Dutta. Rai's first novel, \\"House of Kites\\" (original Hindi title cƒ´lvƒÅlƒ´ ko·π≠hƒ´), came out in 2010. The novel narrates the story of a formerly wealthy, educated and secular lineage of Hindu Banias, traders and accountants, and its gradual decay. The novel, which is set in the ancestral mansion (kothi) of the family in Varanasi (Benaras), is told from the perspectives of its members, among them the orphan Meena, who comes to the mansion as a companion to the family's daughter as a teenager. Meena and the eldest son of the house, Vikram, secretly fall in love with each other. Vikram, who holds a University degree but has no job, engages as social activist and fights for the rights of the poor. However, when the question of marriage arises, he agrees to marry a woman chosen by his parents instead of taking side for his true love (but presumably low-caste) Meena ‚Äì which turns out a fatal decision.  Style of Writing  Rai's short stories depict the everyday lives and perceptions of individuals in contemporary India. They are mainly set in North Indian cities such as Delhi, Varanasi (Benares) or Allahabad. Her characters come from various social, economic and religious backgrounds. \\"On the brink\\" (kagƒÅr par), for example, is told from the perspective of a middle aged gay artist in Delhi who falls in love with a young migrant worker. \\"Babu Devidins new world\\" (BƒÅb≈´ Devidƒ´n kƒ´ nayƒ´ duniyƒÅ) depicts the daily struggles of a hypochondriac pensioner, and \\"Criminal on the run\\" (mujrim farƒÅr) is a narration about a rapist who manages to escape after murdering a young woman but eventually loses his mind in the solitude of his hiding-place. According to the author, this story is based on the real case of the Shakti Mills gang rape that happened in 2013. The author is especially interested in how the clashes and conflicts of modern India surface in the daily life of her protagonists. Many topics of her stories are universal ‚Äì the struggles of getting old in a quickly transforming world, the search for identity in turbulent times, and the experience of being socially excluded in terms of belonging to a ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô class, gender, religion, or socio- economical background. The Hindi scholar Thomas de Bruijn states that ‚ÄûRai‚Äôs work shows the evocative power of a literary idiom in which the heritage of many premodernities are accumulated. Its dialogic nature, refusing to be fixed to a single, monologic identity, makes it a perfect idiom for expressing the conundrum of modernity in a contemporary Indian context.\\" In order to narrate each story from a subjective perspective, Rai frequently applies the narrative device of the \\"stream-of-consciousness\\". This focus on individual perspectives in her writing draws a connection to the Nayi Kahani movement of the 1950s and 60s. Rai's interest in depicting the nuances of human feelings and interactions not only establishes a literary affinity to the Nayi Kahani in Hindi literature, but also to other modern and contemporary writers such as Anton Chekhov, Marcel Proust and Alice Munro.  Language  By calling herself a \\"Hindustani writer\\", Rai positions herself in the shared linguistic and cultural tradition of South Asian Hindus and Muslims. This choice is reflected in the fact that many of her characters display distinctive idioms or different registers of Hindustani. For example, the old Muslim woman in \\"The Labyrinth\\" (bh≈´lbhulaiyƒÅ·πÅ) is strongly influenced by Perso-Arabic vocabulary referring to the Nawabi culture of the 19th century. In other stories, such as in \\"Criminal on the run\\" (mujrim farƒÅr), Rai uses a colloquial style to imitate a mix of illiterate local dialect and urban Bollywood slang as spoken in Mumbai.  Reception  In India, Sara Rai's writing has been receiving growing attention among writers, critics and readers alike. Nirmal Verma states in the preface of Rai's first book AbƒÅbƒ´l kƒ´ u·πõƒÅn: ‚ÄûIf the secret of art is concealed in [E. M.] Forster‚Äôs \\"Only Connect\\" comment, it is Sara Rai's extraordinary talent of searching for a connection between most unrelated things and bringing to light an astonishing truth.\\" Although, she is relatively unknown outside India, her stories have been translated into Urdu, English, German and Italian language.

It was designed in successive stages by Harry & Ernest Sidgreaves shopfitters, architects Harry Lindsay Blackwood and George Newton Kenworthy, with decoration by Otto Steen, and built from 1909 to 1940. It is also known as Paragon Restaurant or simply The Paragon. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 March 2015.  History  =Indigenous history= Prior to European settlement the Blue Mountains was the home of many autonomous Aboriginal groups who lived and moved around the region. There are six distinct tribal groups who have traditional rights and custodial responsibilities for the indigenous heritage of the region that are: the Darug, the Gandangurra, the Wanaruah, the Wiradjuri, the Darkinjung and the Tharawal. Evidence of Aboriginal occupation and custodianship of the country within Blue Mountains National Park dates back to possibly 22,000 years.B. P. Stockton and Holland 1974.Williams et. al. 2012. The Blue Mountains contain a large number of significant sites which capture the relationship that Aboriginal people have had with country for thousands of generations. The rich and varied evidence of traditional occupation of the reserves include archaeological deposits in open sites and rock shelters, stone implements, factory sites for tool production, axe grinding grooves and extensive art-work, including drawn, painted and stencilled images. Tracks and figurative motifs dominate the art sites. Motifs include anthropomorphic figures, animals, hand stencils and tracks of birds and kangaroos.NPWS, 1998. =Colonial history= Katoomba initially developed in a fashion quite distinct from the other Blue Mountains townships along the 1860s railway line. From 1874 onwards trains halted at The Crushers, in the vicinity of the later station, not for passengers but for stone quarried near the later courthouse. The first settlement in the area was to the south-west of the railway, near Katoomba Falls, where John Britty North opened a coal-mine complex in the Jamison Valley in 1878. There was a village near the top of Katoomba Falls and another village grew up deep down in the valley itself close to the base of the Falls, just below where the Scenic Railway ends today. North built a private tramway from the top of the incline near Katoomba Falls to join the main western railway line at what is now known as Shell Corner, a kilometre west of the present station.Jack 2013: 7 All this diverted attention away from the current core area of the urban development, the area on either side of Katoomba Street, that essential north-south connecting link between the railway and Echo Point. This area around Katoomba Street was within the large land-holding of James Henry Neale, a master butcher and Sydney politician, who had been a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1864 until 1874. In 1877 Neale built a country retreat called Froma on what is now the new Cultural Centre site on the east side of Parke Street. In 1881 Neale sold his interest in central Katoomba, including the house, to Frederick Clissold. Clissold, a wool-merchant resident in the Sydney suburb of Ashfield, immediately sub-divided the land, creating and naming the modern street system. Parke, Katoomba and Lurline Streets were created, running north-south, while Waratah Street ran east-west and defined the southern edge of the initial commercial centre of the new town. The Great Western Highway and the railway defined the northern limit. Katoomba changed rapidly; it started as only two industrial halts on the railway, with stone for railway works at one and at the other a private tramway leading down to a coal-mine and two mining villages. Then it became a characteristic Mountains town relating to a proper railway station, as the 78 allotments created in 1881 were, over two decades, purchased and developed. During this period from the 1880s up to the World War I, the whole area below The Carrington, quite close to the railway station, along Katoomba, Parke and Lurline Streets, became a busy commercial precinct, dominated by shops, services and a cluster of guesthouses, tempered by a remarkable number of churches (Anglican, Methodist, Presbyterian, Catholic and Congregationalist) along with their halls and manses. The influx of seasonal tourists and the increasing number of permanent residents who serviced the tourists created a need for local services, so the area between the station and Waratah Street gradually filled up with shops, restaurants, cafes, two theatres and public utilities, such as the post office and the public school.Jack 2013:7 There was still a lot of free space in 1906, captured in a marvellous photograph showing south Katoomba from the most spectacular of the early consolidations, the Great Western Hotel of 1882, better known as the Carrington, on its spacious hill-top site. Froma was still there in 1906, just below the Carrington although it was demolished six years later. Between Froma and Katoomba Street, the site of the later Paragon was a large, empty space, which remained undeveloped until 1909, when William Newlind built four shops on the vacant Katoomba Street block. Newlind had built the four shops as a speculation and three of them were soon bought as an investment by the Anglican rector of St Hilda's, just across the street. These were all retail shops until 1916 when one was converted into refreshment rooms, called The Paragon. =Paragon Cafe and Zacharias Simos= This was just at the beginning of a new phenomenon in Australian country towns, the Greek cafe. From the early 1910s onwards a number of emigres from Greece, often with experience of the United States, created a new cafe experience in cities and towns throughout Australia. The Greek cafe was \\"essentially an evolutionary amalgam\\" of the Greek coffee-house and the American-oyster saloon and soda parlour with the familiar fare of the existing British-Australian steak-houses. The names of the cafes, Californian, Golden Gate, Niagara on the one hand and Acropolis, Parthenon, Paragon on the other, reflected the shared inheritance. In Katoomba a drapery store built at 92 Bathurst Road near the station about 1905 was converted in 1917 to a Greek cafe called the Acropolis and soon rechristened the Niagara to emphasise its trendy American drinks. This is the Australian environment which a fifteen-year-old Greek boy called Zacharias Theodore \\"Jack\\" Simos found when he migrated from Greece in 1912. He found work in Greek cafes in Sydney, Windsor and in Tenterfield. By 1916 he was in Katoomba, where in a brief partnership with Demetruos Sophios he became a fruiterer and a confectioner, opening his own premises in Katoomba called the Paragon Cafe and Oyster Palace.Jack 2013: 8 The Paragon and adjoining shopfronts (63-69 Katoomba Street) is located on Lot 21 of land in Katoomba owned by James Neale and subdivided in the 1880s. The lot was purchased by William Newlind in 1886.LTO, DP 692; vol.374 fo.169 Four shops, nos. 63 to 69, were built on Newlind's land in 1909. The three to the north, nos 63 to 67, including the future Paragon, were all owned in 1911 by the Rev. John Russell, who was the Anglican rector of St Hilda's across the street from 1902 until 1913.Church of England Historical Society Journal, 8 iii, Sept. 1963, 405 Since Russell did not own the fourth shop, it is likely that he was not responsible for building on the site but merely bought existing new shops as an investment. He retained ownership of the properties until 1924. From this date Russell maintained only one investment property in Katoomba: No.100-102 Katoomba Street (Rate Books). It is believed the income from the shops was an important part of Russell's income, particularly after Russell went to Sydney as senior curate to the rector of St James.Cable: 42 Russell leased the shops as three separate entities. By 1914 No. 63 was leased by a jeweller, L.P. Goldstein. He bought the freehold from Russell in 1924. The shop was later occupied by another jeweller, H. Lloyd. Jewellers have continued to occupy the shop for most of its history. No. 65 was leased by Russell to a series of shopkeepers - Sullivan in 1914-6 and Dagon from 1917 to 1919. By 1923 he had leased it to Zacharias Simos as refreshment rooms called The Paragon, and in 1924 Zacharias Simos purchased both nos. 65 and 67 from Russell.Rate Books Simos was a Greek migrant who had arrived in Sydney early in the century. He migrated to Sydney in 1912 and like many of his countrymen worked in Greek cafes and other food related businesses in NSW. His arrival in Sydney predated the post world war one arrival of many young men from countries such as Greece and Italy after the United States began limiting the numbers of Southern Europeans it allowed into the country. Many of the young men paid their way to Australia and found work in the food industry. Zacharias Simos worked in Sydney and Tenterfield for the first four years before setting up a business at Windsor where he sold ham and eggs next door to a skating rink and sold vegetables door to door. During this time he saved his money and learned English sufficiently well to establish himself as a confectioner in Katoomba. During this time he worked as a caterer. Zacharias Simos was naturalised in 1921and bought a commercial property at 110-114 Katoomba Street owned by Miss Kelly and previously run by a Mrs Banning. Three years later he purchased the refreshment rooms at 65 and 67 Katoomba Street. In 1925 Zacharias Simos employed H. & E. Sidgreaves, the shop-fitting firm responsible for the design of Washington H. Soul's Sydney pharmacies, to convert the interior of the cafe premises on classical (Art Deco) lines, along with local architect Harry Lindsay Blackwood. A soda fountain, of the finest Moruya marble, and booths of Queensland maple were installed as were the timber-panelled walls decorated with alabaster friezes depicting classical Greek figures. The fine and intact leadlight shopfronts which characterise the building were probably included in this work and have become an important part of the architectural character of Katoomba Street. The street contains many other fine examples of glazed shopfronts from the 1920s and it has been suggested that together they may be the largest extant collection of 1920s leadlight shopfronts in NSW and comparable to Canowindra in the central west of NSW.Lumby: 2000 Upstairs in 1925 was the industrial side of the enterprise, not open to the public. There was a bakehouse, a large refrigeration plant for the ice-cream made on the premises and a new \\"sweet factory\\", with a gas boiler and a forced-air draught for cooling the chocolate. The technology of the chocolaterie is well documented, although the equipment was dismantled a decade ago. The chocolate-making equipment is still stored upstairs and on April 10, 2013 members of the Australian Society for the History of Engineering & Technology (ASHET) committee inspected and photographed the various items. This industrial dimension to the Paragon is of exceptional importance. Chocolate-making at the Paragon had been of a high order ever since Zacharias Simos had been joined by his two brothers: George was a master confectioner and they were trading as Simos Brothers by 1926.Jack 2013:9 Originally, Zacharias Simos lived above the shop, in that part of the upstairs rabbit-warren overlooking Katoomba Street which was not used for making chocolates or for baking cakes. The bakery and the chocolaterie which gave The Paragon so much of its distinction were located upstairs from the mid-1920s, so the products which gave the place such well-deserved fame were made on site. The earlier chocolate-making machinery and some of the baking equipment was dismantled and stored in a short corridor upstairs about ten years ago, but a historic photograph at the Paragon today shows every item in use forty years ago. The equipment has been assessed by members of Australian Society for the History of Engineering and Technology. It is striking how international it all is. The Simos brothers took some trouble to acquire the best available machinery. Small and Shattell Pty Ltd, Melbourne-based engineers who specialised in baking equipment, along with Star Machinery of Alexandria, are among the few Australian firms patronised. A major French firm, Kstner frres of Lyon, had been making bakery equipment for the world for fifty years. There is also another piece of equipment from the firm when it was located not in Lyons but in Paris and Aubervilliers. America, with which the Simos had strong connections, was not overlooked. Metal piping was made by Walworth of Boston. The confectionery equipment was made by the prestigious firm BCH. What became the major modern firm called BCH had originated in the mid-nineteenth century in the separate works of William Brierley, Luke Collier and Thomas Hartley. Luke Collier was a specialist confectioner from 1835; Brierley was a brass-founder, specialising in confectionery work from 1844 onwards; and Hartley was also an independent specialist in chocolate-making. The Brierley and Collier firms amalgamated in 1913 and this firm joined forces with the Hartley family in 1924. Operating out of Rochdale in England the Brierley-Collier-Hartley firm went from strength to strength and finally became BCH. Simos seems to have ordered this equipment from BCH in the decade after the final amalgamation of 1924. In 1929 Zacharias returned to Kythera and spent a year in Europe observing trends in confectionery manufacture and cafe culture. He also arranged to import new ingredients and learned about presentation and packaging. On Kythera he met and courted Mary (Maria) Panaretos (1912-2001). She had been born on 20 June 1912 at Elkton, Maryland, United States of America, where her parents were cafe proprietors who regularly spent the summer months on Kythera. Mary and Zacharias married there on 30 January 1930 and reached Katoomba later that year.Low, John, 2005. Zacharias Simos and his wife set about turning the Paragon into a high class refreshment room. The popular Katoomba landmark Orphan Rock became his trademark, an image of the \\"stand-alone\\" excellence to which he aspired. Mary became an identifiable figure at the Paragon. She was generous and cultured, and always on hand to welcome visitors and press chocolates into the hands of children. Zacharias also began planning two large extensions at the rear of his cafe: the banquet hall (1934), influenced by pre-Columbian decoration, and the blue room (1936), in \\"ocean liner\\" style, with mirrored walls and sprung dance floor. (ADB). The design of these 1930s interiors has been attributed to theatre architect Henry Eli White however he had ceased practice by this time, and more recent research attributes the work to his former partner George Newton Kenworthy.Lumby 2000 The upper level facade of the cafe is clearly in the Art Deco style and may also date from this time, and be the work of Kenworthy. In the late 1930s Zacharias and Mary bought vacant land on what is now Cliff Drive down at Echo Point and in 1940 they again commissioned G. N. Kenworthy to design a striking curve-fronted Streamline Moderne style house, which they called Olympus. Despite some additions to the upper frontage in the 1980s, the house and its important outbuildings, (garage, pergola, summer- house, fuel store), have retained a great deal of integrity. This is the necessary corollary to the Paragon, blending perfectly with the developed facade of the famous cafe. In the early post war years a decorative relief sculpture by Otto Steen depicting various characters from Greek mythology was installed in the Dining Room. He was a student of Raynor Hoff who created the sculptures for the ANZAC War Memorial in the Sydney. Steen worked with Hoff at the memorial. Steen's other decorative works include those in two major Sydney buildings in the 1930s - the Trocadero in George Street and the AWA Building in York Street. He was also responsible for the relief sculptures at Everglades, Leura. Steen is now considered one of the twentieth century's accomplished sculptors who made a significant contribution to NSW's interwar and post war heritage. The Paragon gained a wide reputation. Its ice creams were originally hand churned and frozen with American ammonia freezing machines and sundaes blended with syrups and fruit ingredients, often specially imported. The art deco ambience attracted devoted customers. With the help of his brothers Peter and George, bread, cakes and pastries were manufactured on the premises, as well as chocolates and other confectioneries sold in exquisitely designed and coloured boxes (ADB). In this period the Blue Mountains was among NSW's most important holiday and recreation centres and Katoomba was a focal point of this activity. The Paragon also catered to more adult tastes and would later be described as one of the smartest cocktail bars in the art deco style in Australia.Bayer 1990:153 The shop at number 69 was bought in the 1930s by Mary Simos so that the three shops, nos. 65, 67, and 69, were all in the Simos family control (Rate Books). The shop at no.69 had a different owner when constructed in 1909, Reuben S. Hofman. Hofman appears to have used it as his own draper's shop. After his retirement, Hofman leased no.69 initially to E. Luce, also a draper, in the early 1920s, but it became a confectioner's in the mid-1920s, competing with the Paragon. The Simos' primary residence was Olympus; they also maintained a home in Sydney at Centennial Park. Zacharias devoted many hours to his garden - meaning the Paragon always had fresh flowers - loved music, played the violin and was a keen fisherman and backgammon player. Enjoying travel, he visited Europe, the US and Kythera several times. He was a foundation member of Katoomba Rotary Club, which for many years held its meetings in the Paragon. Zacharias died on 15 November 1976 in Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, and was buried in Randwick cemetery following a funeral at St George's Greek Orthodox Church, Rose Bay. His wife, carried on as manager of The Paragon until 1987. Mary Simos died on 15 May 2001 at Rose Bay and was buried beside her husband. =Subsequent ownership= The cafe was sold in 2000. The tea-room has remained as a remarkably intact example of Interwar Art Deco. Robyn Parker was the proprietor of the Paragon from May 2011 to May 2018, and worked to regain its original splendour. She played an important role in having the site listed on the NSW State Heritage Register.Lumby, 2016, 16 She vacated the building in May 2018 after negotiations with the landlord failed to result in either building maintenance or a rent cut. Following Parker's departure, the cafe has been closed, with both landlord and former tenant making claims to the Paragon name. The Paragon has now reopened under management of Robyn Parker at a new location on Katoomba st, up the road and opposite Carrington hotel. The Paragon's architects =Harry and Ernest Sidgreaves= Harry and Ernest Sidgreaves established a modest retail shopfitting workshop in Sydney's Surry Hills in 1917 and were later joined by their father John and youngest brother Harold. They moved their factory to Redfern in the early 1920s where the company carried on business until 1984 when it relocated to Silverwater. Sidgreaves undertook much shopfront construction during the interwar period in Sydney and surrounds. This included one of their most celebrated early works, a streamlined shopfront for G. A. Zink and Son in Oxford Street, East Sydney, 1938. In 2005, the Company relocated to larger and more contemporary offices in Annandale where it remains today. Throughout the 90+ year history of the Company, Sidgreaves has specialised in all areas of interior refurbishment from major department stores, specialty retailers, financial institutions and commercial offices through to hotels, clubs and pharmacies. In the 21st century Sidgreaves ranks many national and international companies amongst its clients in Australia including Burberry, Versace, Jimmy Choo, Saba and Sheridan.http://www.sidgreaves.com/history/ =Otto Seen= Otto Seen studied at the Royal Academy, Copenhagen under Utzon Frank 1923-1925. He studied under Raynor Hoff at East Sydney Technical College from 1928-1930 and worked as Hoff's assistant on the ANZAC memorial. As Hoff's student, Steen was part of perhaps the only instance of coherent (European) group production of sculpture in Australia. The unity of style and subject matter of the sculptures created by Hoff and his students was so great that the works have been designated as part of 'the Hoff School\\". The theme of Greek mythology in Steen's work at The Paragon reflected the influence of his work as a member of the Hoff School with its classicist tendencies. It was a local decision made on behalf of the local community with input from appropriate experts. Steen completed reliefs at King George V Hospital in Sydney (1941) as well as those at the Trocadero, Sydney, 1936 (frieze), the AWA building, Sydney, 1939 (mosaic, relief), Everglades and The Paragon.Edwards 2000 =Henry White= The New South Wales Heritage Register entry for the Paragon Cafe states that \\"the design of the 1925 and 1930s interiors has generally been attributed to Henry Eli White\\", however there is no direct record of his involvement. The 1920s work was by local architect Harry Lindsay Blackwood and Harry and Ernest Sidgreaves shopfitters, rather than Henry White. The 1930s work could not have been by White as he had ceased practicing by 1930, instead George Newton Kenworthy is recorded as the architect. Kenworthy had worked as a senior architect in White's office in the 1920s, before starting his own practice in 1929, and this perhaps is where the confusion comes from. =George Newton Kenworthy= G N Kenworthy was a lead architect and project manager in the offices of prolific theatre architect Henry Eli White in the 1920s, before branching out on his own in 1929. Kenworthy went on to design a number of theatres and cinemas in the 1930s in the Art Deco style, notably the Cremorne Orpheum, as well as the Royal Hotel, Orange, and the Simos' house Olympus in 1940. In 1934, he was also the architect for a large ballroom and coffee lounge in the basement of the State Theatre, known as the State Ballroom and State Coffee Lounge, in the style of the original.  Description  63-69 Katoomba Street has a two-storey rendered inter-war art deco facade to Katoomba Street with retail premises at ground level. 1930s copper clad shopfronts survive to the northern two shops and feature the names of the shops at that period: Lloyds Jeweller at no. 63 and the Paragon at no. 65. The Paragon also features curved display windows either side of the recessed entry and display cases on the tiled piers. The upper level is divided into four bays each with multi-paned glazed doors opening to rendered bay form balconies. Concrete hoods on shallow corbelled brackets overhang the doors. Vertical chevron mouldings at the centre of a stepped parapet mark the second bay from the north, over The Paragon and hold the vertical sign advertising the restaurant. The building has its 1930s awning, with its original pressed metal soffit, extending over Froma Lane to the south. Internally, The Paragon restaurant retains its inter- war art deco interiors. The front section has a panelled timber shop fitout and timber booth seating with panelled timber walls and plaster moulds of classical figures. Original chairs with the \\"P\\" motif for the restaurant remain in service. The rear rooms of The Paragon are fitted behind the adjacent shops and feature a ballroom/dining room lined with timber veneers with a coved plaster ceiling to the south influenced by the decor of ocean liners. To the north is the bar (former banquet hall) with perforated plaster friezework showing a pre-Columbian influence in its motifs. The toilet spaces also retain much of their original fitout. The retail premises at 63 (formerly jeweller) and 69 (chemist) Katoomba Street have been internally fit-out with modern shop fitouts. Some early fabric my survive at tenancy at No.63 but the tenancy at No.69 has been extensively modified. Modern ligthbox style signs are located in front of Nos. 63 and 69. = Condition = As at 17 January 2013, Basically good, but in need of conservation internally and of work to secure the building against potential rain damage and water ingress at ground floor level at the rear of the building.

Due to its focus on family planning, the State has enabled free and unrestricted access to abortion services and contraceptive services in the country. Vietnam also has one of the highest rates of abortion that has been surveyed in the world.  Legality of Abortion in Vietnam  There is limited information on the legal status of induced abortion in Vietnam. Information suggests that abortion was available on request from at least 1971 and was available in the entire country since the 1975 unification. There are a number of laws that codify abortion rights in various ways. Due to its emphasis on family planning, abortion in Vietnam has been legalised without any restrictions on the reason for seeking the abortion. Family planning was made a national priority upon the unification of Vietnam, leading to the incentivization of contraception and abortion acceptance. The Constitution of Vietnam ensures that men and women enjoy equal rights in all circumstances such as reproductive health: ‚ÄúThe State, society, family and citizen have the responsibility to provide health care and protection to mother and children; and carry out the population and family planning program.‚Äù The Vietnamese National Assembly adopted the Law on Marriage and Family in 1960, which is based on four major principles ‚Äì freedom of marriage; monogamy; gender equality; and the protection of women‚Äôs and children‚Äôs rights. The Law on the Protection of Public Health, that was passed on 30 June 1989, affirming people's right to make reproductive decisions over their body and choose their own contraceptive methods. It states that: ‚ÄúWomen have the rights to have abortion; to receive gynaecological diagnosis and treatment, and health check- up during pregnancy; and medical service when giving birth at health facilities.‚Äù By 1989, the Law on Protection of People‚Äôs Health was approved, affirming the people‚Äôs right to choose contraceptive methods. In Article 6 of Decision No. 162 of the Council of Ministers in January 1989 obligated that the State was to provide, for free, birth control devices and public-health services for abortions to eligible persons ‚Äì \\"The state will supply, free of charge, birth control devices, such as intrauterine loops and condoms, birth control pills and public health services for the insertion of intrauterine loops and abortions to eligible persons who are cadres, manual workers, civil servants or members of the armed forces, persons to whom priority is given under policy and poor persons who register to practice family planning.\\" Also, Decree No. 12/CP on the promulgation of Social Insurance Regulations authorizes sick leave for abortions. Significantly, the Criminal Code of Vietnam does not contain any provisions that criminalise abortion practices, pointing to its unrestricted legality in the country. Family planning in Vietnam is helmed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Committee for Population (NCPFP). Family planning and abortion services are provided through a network of MOH-approved healthcare centres, including central and provincial hospitals, provincial family planning centres, district hospitals and health centres, intercommunal polyclinics, and commune health centres. MOH-approved physicians, assistant physicians and trained midwives are legally allowed to perform abortions. As defined in the current National Abortion Standards and Guidelines (NASGs), abortion services are made accessible at three administrative levels of the health system: (1) abortion from six to 18 weeks from the last menstrual period (LMP) is available at central and provincial hospitals; (2) abortion from six to 12 weeks of LMP is also available at district health stations; and (3) communal health clinics may only offer abortion to women who are not more than six weeks pregnant.  Abortion Rates  Vietnam has one of the highest abortion rates in the world. A study conducted by the Hanoi Central Obstetrics Hospital found that 40% of all pregnancies in Vietnam are terminated each year.

The legal services was successfully implemented on December 25, 2003. The high maternal mortality rates in Nepal lead to the government legalising it. More than 5,00,000 women sought abortion between 2004‚Äì2014. In 2014, 323,100 women in Nepal had the abortion, among this only 42% abortions were legal and 19% were treated for abortion complications. Similar study had found the rate of unintended pregnancy as 50%.  Methods for Abortion  According to the services provided by the government, Women are allowed to choose between Manual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA) and Medical Abortion (MA) abortion procedures. Manual Vacuum Aspiration: It is a moderately invasive procedure where cervical dilators are used and suction is applied to remove the pregnancy from the uterus. Medical Abortion: Medical Abortion is a method most often combining a series of two types of oral pills taken to terminate the pregnancy. The experience is similar to a miscarriage and many patients feel it is a less invasive option.  Abortion Law in Nepal  Prior to 2002, Nepal had strict anti-abortion laws which ensured not only the imprisonment of the pregnant women who seek abortion but also their family members. In fact about 20% of women prisoners were imprisoned for abortion-related choices. According to the law women had access to legal abortion only under the following conditions ¬∑ The pregnancy must be under 12 weeks of gestation. If the woman is above 16 years of age, she does not require the permission of her husband or her guardian. ¬∑ In the case of rape or incest, the pregnancy must be under 18 weeks of gestation. ¬∑ If recommended by the doctor, at any stage of the pregnancy if it poses danger to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman or if the foetus suffers from severe physical deformity.

The magnitude 7.5 quake was located away from the provincial capital Palu and was felt as far away as Samarinda on East Kalimantan and also in Tawau, Malaysia. This event was preceded by a sequence of foreshocks, the largest of which was a magnitude 6.1 tremor that occurred earlier that day. Following the mainshock, a tsunami alert was issued for the nearby Makassar Strait. A localised tsunami struck Palu, sweeping shore-lying houses and buildings on its way. The combined effects of the earthquake and tsunami led to the deaths of an estimated 4,340 people. This makes it the deadliest earthquake to strike the country since the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake, as well as the deadliest earthquake worldwide in 2018, surpassing the previous earthquake that struck Lombok a few months earlier, killing more than 500. The Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG) confirmed that a tsunami had been triggered, with its height reaching an estimated maximum of , striking the settlements of Palu, Donggala and Mamuju along its path. The earthquake caused major soil liquefaction in areas in and around Palu. In two locations this led to mudflows in which many buildings became submerged causing hundreds of deaths with many more missing. The liquefaction was considered to be the largest in the world and was deemed as rare. Tectonic setting Sulawesi lies within the complex zone of interaction between the Australian, Pacific, Philippine and Sunda Plates in which many small microplates are developed. The main active structure onshore in the western part of Central Sulawesi is the left-lateral NNW-SSE trending Palu-Koro strike-slip fault that forms the boundary between the North Sula and Makassar blocks. The rate of slip along this fault is estimated to be in the range 30‚Äì40 mm per year. At Palu, there are several parallel fault strands defining the margins of a pull-apart basin, each of which take up some of the overall slip. Several major earthquakes have been attributed to movement on this fault since 1900 and three larger events in the last 2,000 years have been deduced from studies of the fault zone. In 2017 a study recognised this fault as representing the greatest seismic risk in eastern Indonesia. Earthquake Map of the Sulawesi earthquake =Foreshocks= The mainshock was preceded by a sequence of foreshocks starting about three hours earlier with a M6.1 event, followed by several others, all located in the area immediately south of the mainshock epicentre. The first foreshock occurred at 15:00 WITA (Indonesia Central Standard Time). The earthquake struck at a shallow depth of 10 km with a magnitude of 5.9 (BMKG). The USGS registered the size of the quake as 6.1 . Strong shaking was felt in Donggala. At least 1 person was killed by fallen debris while 10 others were injured. Authorities confirmed that dozens of structures were either damaged or destroyed in the quake. =Mainshock= Shakemap of the 2018 Sulawesi earthquake The mainshock occurred at 18:02 WITA, during rush hour traffic. The shaking was felt as far away as Samarinda, the capital of East Kalimantan, to the west and Makassar in the south. It was also felt in several parts in Gorontalo, located on the north and was also felt in Tawau, Malaysia. Violent shaking was reported in Donggala and Palu. Blackouts occurred throughout the area and telecommunications went down. The state-owned Telkomsel reported that more than 500 wireless communication towers had been damaged by the earthquake. The earthquake happened during the 40th anniversary of the city of Palu. To commemorate the anniversary, the Government of Palu on each year holds a festival, the Palu Nomoni Festival, with its starting point from Wina Hotel to Talise Beach, stretching almost 3.8 kilometres on the coast of Palu. Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach. The festival was expected to attract international paragliders as an international paragliding event was also being held as a part of the festival. Hotel owners in Palu reported that the number of guests had risen significantly due to the festival. In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, the festival was resumed. The mainshock magnitude was initially reported as M7.7 by both the USGS and BMKG. The USGS later revised their estimate to M7.5. The focal mechanism of the earthquake showed that it was caused by strike-slip faulting on faults trending either roughly north‚Äìsouth or west‚Äìeast. Further analysis of seismic waveforms suggests that a fault trending north‚Äìsouth gives a better fit. The earthquake was caused by movement on the Palu-Koro fault. Geodetic evidence suggests that about 150 km of the fault ruptured. During the mainshock, the rupture propagated at speeds in excess of the S-wave velocity as determined by back-projection of teleseismic data, and supported by satellite geodesy. The possibility of supershear rupture on the Palu-Koro Fault was raised in 2017. Indonesian authorities confirmed that no one had been able to contact a single person from Donggala, the closest town to the epicentre. As of 1 October, contacts were still hampered by downed telecommunication lines. =Aftershocks= The mainshock was followed by a series of aftershocks, with 14 of M‚â•5.0 in the first 24 hours. Since then, a total of 150 aftershocks have struck the region. =Intensity= The earthquake was felt over a wide area. Noticeable shaking, ranging from II-III on the Mercalli intensity scale, was reported in Samarinda, Makassar and Tawau. The strongest shaking was felt in Donggala Regency where a maximum intensity of IX (violent) was recorded. The maximum intensity in Palu, the provincial capital of Central Sulawesi, was at VIII (severe). According to the Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application for Technology (BPPT), energy released by the quake was 200 times to that released in the 1945 nuclear bombing of Hiroshima. Analysis also showed that the shoreline which was located near the rupture in Palu and Donggala had a decrease on its height. Height drops of 0.5‚Äì1 meter were recorded, while an increase of height of around 0.3 cm was recorded in Banawa. Tsunami A tsunami warning was issued in Palu and Donggala at 18:07 WITA. Warnings were sent via SMS by the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information. Residents of Donggala were told to expect tsunamis with heights of 0.5 to 3 metres, while residents in Palu were told to expect tsunamis with heights of less than 0.5 metres. The tsunami, however, struck higher than expected. Residents of Palu reported waves with heights of more than 2 metres while several others stated that the waves managed to reach the second floor. Indonesian officials calculated the estimated time of arrival of the tsunami. Calculations suggested that the tsunami would arrive in Palu approximately 20 minutes after the earthquake. Around 18:27 WITA, the Indonesian meteorological agency (BMKG) in Mamuju detected tsunamis. A tsunami warning was issued, and later lifted. The BMKG claimed the warning was lifted after the tsunami had struck, the timing is clear, but since there was a one-hour time difference between the sunset in Palu and Java where many Indonesian in social media reside, many thought the warning was lifted before the tsunami hit, because the video that circulating around was after the sunset, while the warning lifted around 18:27 WITA it was 17:27 WIB for most of these people reside where the sun is still high up, resulting the agency being criticized on social media. Even though officials did send warnings via telephone and television, tsunami alarms were not activated. The Palu Nomoni Festival in Talise Beach continued and most of the festival attendees did not realize that there was a possibility of a tsunami. Eyewitnesses even stated that some people were still strolling on the beach when the tsunami struck. It was estimated that hundreds were caught off guard and swept away by the waves. The Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG) later admitted that the tsunami detectors in Palu were damaged in the earthquake. The shaking was violent enough to damage the tsunami detectors in Palu, as further examination revealed that none of the detectors were able to send signals to alert residents. As Palu was located at the end of a narrow bay, the tsunami's force was intensified when the waters entered. Officials confirmed that the waves that struck Palu had actually reached a height of 5 metres, with some as nearly as high as 6 metres. The tsunami surprised geologists. It was expected to be at a low height, no more than about 2 metres, since the earthquake was a strike-slip earthquake, which usually don't have enough vertical movement to create large tsunamis. One explanation is that the earthquake triggered underwater landslides, causing the tsunami. A study of coastal liquefaction has suggested that 84% of the tsunami amplitude was a result of the combined effect of coastal and submarine landslides, based on an analysis of tide gauge records at Pantoloan. Newer research suggests the earthquake created about 1.5 meters of vertical seafloor movement, which, combined with a very fast rupture speed, could have produced the tsunami, regardless of any landslides. Damage More than 70,000 houses are reported to be damaged, forcing tens of thousands of people to live in shelters and tents. In Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi, a mosque and a major section of the Antapura Hospital collapsed. Palu's Tatura Mall, one of the oldest shopping centres in Palu, collapsed, trapping dozens of people. An eight-story hotel, identified as the Roa-Roa Hotel, had also collapsed, trapping numerous hotel guests, several of whom were participants of the Palu's annual paragliding festival. At the time of the earthquake, 76 of the 80 bedrooms of the hotel were occupied. thumb Palu's Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport was forced to close as large cracks, one of which was 500 meters long, had been formed on the runway. Airport officials confirmed that the navigation system was damaged and the control tower of the airport collapsed. An air traffic controller, who was watching the take-off roll of Batik Air 6231 during the earthquake, was killed due to internal injuries. Major structural damage was also reported in the airport, with the roof the airport's terminal reportedly caved in. The airport was reopened for limited operation on 29 September 2018. Due to the damage in the airport, hundreds of passengers were stranded and were told to wait in the airport's apron. Normal operation returned on service on 30 September. Authorities confirmed that numerous settlements and residential areas, including more than a thousand homes, had been destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami. The tsunami also caused major damage to ports in Palu. In Pantoloan Harbour, a Quay crane collapsed and was swept by the tsunami. In Wani Harbour, structural damage was reported, while Ogoamas Harbour moved 3 cm to its right due to the earthquake. The IAIN Datokarama Palu, a university in Palu, was severely damaged by the tsunami. The Kuning Ponulele Bridge was among those that were destroyed in the earthquake (seen back in 2010) Officials confirmed that Palu's iconic bridge, the Kuning Ponulele Bridge (Jembatan Palu IV), which was also the first arch bridge in Indonesia, was destroyed by the earthquake and the ensuing tsunami. Roads to and from the city, connecting it to Makassar and Poso, were also severely damaged. There were also reports of landslides. Communication to the affected area was severely hampered, with President Joko Widodo being initially unable to contact governor Longki Djanggola. Ministry of Communication and Information Technology announced that 1,678 base transceiver station in Central Sulawesi were damaged by the earthquake and disaster. Local hospitals were damaged, with the Director of the Palu Undata Hospital opting to treat victims outside of the hospital and made a public plea for tents, medicine, canvas, and nurses. A warden for a prison in Palu reported that more than half of its 560 inmates fled in panic as the prison walls collapsed.

The regiment was recruited and organised by Francesco Rivarola in 1815; Rivarola had proved himself loyal to the British Crown in fighting France. In 1861 the regiment was disbanded as an infantry unit and designated as a coastal artillery defence regiment, becoming the Royal Malta Fencible Artillery. Uniform The regiment was clothed in the same uniform as the rest of the British army and all ranks dress uniform was a close-fitting scarlet tunic with tails, blue facings and gold lace for officers, dark blue/grey trousers or white overalls and headgear being the standard black infantry shako of various patterns issued to the British Army during the time of the unit's establishment. The shako badge was modelled on the British infantry standard eight-pointed facetted star with a Maltese crest at the centre and an immediate surrounding regimental title. In 1989 a set of Maltese commemorative stamps (the 4 Cent stamp) included an illustration of an officer of the regiment in dress uniform of 1839. Unit role British Army units designated Fencibles were normally local forces raised for defence of an immediate locality and were commonplace in the United Kingdom.. Many of Malta's noble families would provide the regiment with its officers Unit organisation and deployment The regiment initially consisted of ten companies of Maltese soldiers and these were spread over the main island of Malta, with seven based in garrison areas within the greater Valletta area. Three of the companies were trained as coastal artillery, and were located in fixed defensive points in and around St Julian‚Äôs, Marsaxlokk and St Paul's Bay. In 1817 the unit would be reduced to six companies, each under the command of a captain. The regiment augmented the island's police force and provided young officers to act as adjutants to local police force commanders. However by 1821 the unit was tasked with general military duties, giving up its police tasks. In 1835 an article in the United Services Magazine put the total strength of the unit at 468; in 1836 Statistics of the Colonies of the British Empire gave far more detail on the Royal Malta Fencible Regiment's establishment as: * One colonel commanding * One major * One lieutenant Adjutant * Six captains * Six lieutenants * Six ensigns * One paymaster * One quartermaster * One surgeon * One assistant surgeon * One sergeant-major * Six colour sergeants * One drum- major * One sergeant paymaster's clerk * One sergeant school master * Four staff sergeants * Fourteen sergeants * Twenty four corporals * 11 drummers * 444 privates. On 21 November 1838 Lieutenant General Sir Henry F Bouverie (Governor of Malta and commanding the Malta Garrison), presented the regiment with a set of colours on the Floriana Parade Ground. The regiment parading was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel the Marquess de Piro. Between 1829 and 1839 the unit's officer manning levels remained fairly stable at: * A regimental colonel - in 1829 and 1839 it was the Count Francesco Rivarola (who had seen active service with the Royal Sicilian Regiment) * A regimental major/lieutenant colonel - in 1829 and 1839 it was the Marquis Guiseppe de Piro * Six captains * Seven to eight lieutenants (including an adjutant) * Six to seven ensigns * A paymaster * A quarter-master * A surgeon and an assistant surgeon In 1856 Imperial account returns record that the \\"Royal Malta Fencibles\\" cost the Crown just under ¬£12,197, less ¬£1,099 in pay stoppages. On 3 January 1862 the New York Times reported on a lecture given by Captain Petrie at United Service Institution in London that confirmed that the regiment still consisted of six line companies, plus staff.. By the time the report was filed the regiment had ceased to exist as infantry and had become a static garrison artillery force - the Royal Malta Fencible Artillery.

The UAL MEC represents over 13,000 pilots at United as their formal collective bargaining agent under the Railway Labor Act. They are responsible for negotiating pilot contracts, in addition to enhancing airline safety and security. History Air Line Pilots Associationalt=238x238px On July 27, 1931, under the leadership of United Captain Dave Behncke, the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) was created. Captain Dave Behncke served as ALPA's first president, from 1931 until 1951, during which time ALPA became active in Washington, D.C. and worked to secure legislation that made the airline piloting profession safer for both workers and passengers. Today, the United MEC continues its history of involvement on Capitol Hill, along with promoting legislation that benefits pilots, advances airline safety, and enhances security. The ALPA motto is \\"Schedule with Safety\\" and many of the safety features found in current aircraft and airports are the result of United ALPA volunteer initiatives. Their contract, the United Pilot Agreement, establishes work rules and provides for higher pay, making them one of the highest paid pilot groups in the industry.  Leadership  United Airlines Captain and UAL MEC Chairman Todd Insler Every two years, the United MEC elects four officers to serve the pilots of United Airlines as MEC leadership. Captain Todd Insler, a 26-year veteran of United Airlines, was unanimously reelected in January, 2020 and is serving his third term as chairman. Captain Insler previously held positions as MEC Grievance Committee chairman and vice chairman. Additionally, Mr. Insler is a member of the Board of Directors at United Continental Holdings, Inc. Captain Tom Murphy, based in Washington D.C., serves as Vice Chairman. Denver Based Captain Bill Neveu serves as Secretary, and Washington D.C. based Captain Rick Cameron serves as Treasurer. On the local level, the United MEC consists of member-elected representatives at the eleven United domiciles throughout the United States and Guam. Local pilot volunteers form the foundation of the committee, and full-time ALPA staff assist the group with legal, administrative, and communications support. In 2018, two United pilots were elected as national officers of ALPA: Captain Bob Fox was elected ALPA's First Vice President and Captain Joseph Genovese was elected Vice President - Finance/Treasurer.

After being taken over by a business group, the company announced its plans to acquire a studio and begin film production under the oversight of Pat Powers, however this did not occur. In 1926, Lewis J. Selznick was appointed to manage the company following the bankruptcy of his own studio.

It was designed by Richard Wynne and built from 1875 to 1893 by Joseland and Gilling; Turkish Bath house by Earnest A. Bonney. It is also known as The Turkish Bath. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 12 April 2002.  History  In 1833 William Romaine Govett completed his survey of 'the mountain ranges immediately to the north of Bell's Ridge' in which he described Mount Wilson as \\"high mass of range of the richest soil and covered with impenetrable scrub\\". In 1868 Surveyor E. S. Wyndham completed his survey including 62 portions situated at Mount Wilson, Parish of Irvine, County of Cook. Richard Wynne is listed in 1870 as living at Wynstay on Liverpool Road, Burwood between Drivers Road and Alt Street. After an attempted sale by auction in April 1870, Wynne purchased six allotments of Wyndham's subdivisions between 1875 and 1876. In 1875 Richard Wynne completed his first term as Mayor of Burwood and that year built a cottage on his property at Mt. Wilson. Between 1876 and 1878 Wynne appears to have built a second, larger house called Yarrawa, which burned down in 1906. A photograph of this second house held by the Mount Wilson & Mt. Irvine Historical Society was taken by Bischoff, a photographer with Eccleston du Faur's expedition in the Grose Valley, dating it to well before 1893. During this period Wynne is said to have employed a stonemason, John Rowland. The stables, gate lodge, the timber house now known as Old Wynstay and much of the crenulated stone walls were completed. Between 1875 and 1879 the road towards Mount Irvine was resurveyed to skirt the top of the hill on which Wynstay now stands, presumably because the road surveyed by Wyndham was too steep. On 3 September 1879 the redundant section of old road, was purchased by Richard Wynne as the gates, Old Wynstay and much of the crenulated walls are located on this land. In 1880 the name Yarrawa appears to have still been in use. Henry John Wynne (Richard Wynne's son) acquired portion 64 to the north of the old road by Crown grant in 1882. By this time, the portion was bisected by the Mount Irvine Road. The name Yarrawa was in use right up until 1921, as noted in the correspondence with Colonel Richard Owen Wynne. Wynne's inventory of 1893 recorded the existence of the Turkish Bath, a house known as Wynstay and other buildings on the estate - unfortunately this 1893 inventory referred to has never been sighted since. In 1893 drawings for a \\"Turkish Bath in the Italianate style\\" were included in \\"The Settlement of Mt Wilson\\" by Fraser, James & Mack. There is some doubt about the drawings of the Turkish Bath in that thesis. They were not drawn by architect Earnest H.Bonney but more likely by the authors. Recent research indicates the Turkish Bath House was built (well) before 1890 - probably in the mid 1880s for use by Richard's wife Mary Anne, who had fallen into ill health and whose doctors had prescribed a course of Turkish baths. Mrs Wynne died in July 1889 of abdominal cancer.Design 5 Architects, 1999 On 15 June 1895 Richard Wynne died at Greta, Macdonald Street, Potts Point. Cause of death was listed as being senile decay, purpura and cerebral congestion. His wife, Mary Ann Neich was recorded as being deceased. Also recorded is that of their five male children, only one, Henry John Wynne, then aged 36 years age, was living. On 16 April 1896 the Wynstay Estate was held in trust by the Perpetual Trustee Company, Sydney. On 22 January 1898 Henry John Wynne died at Mount Wilson aged 38 of chronic Bright's disease. The death certificate describes Henry as being of independent means, and the duration of his last illness one year. It also listed his children Richard O. and Dulcie M. as living and aged 5 and 3 respectively. On 18 December 1913 Richard Owen Wynne Esq. of Watford, England, Richard Wynne's grandson, became the new owner of the Wynstay Estate. R. O. Wynne returned to Australia, with his English bride and in the same year work commenced on the construction of the present Wynstay, to the design of Joseland and Gilling Architects. The Turkish Bath was converted into living quarters for the three stonemasons constructing the new home. From to 1945 the Turkish Bath continued to be used as a residence and little or no further alteration to the building occurred during this time. James Inglis, a new arrival in NSW in 1877 from India with a commission to write on the Australian colonies as a field for \\"Anglo-Indian capital\\", produced \\"Our Australian Cousins\\" in which he wrote in glowing terms of Mount Wilson. In 1880 he visited Edward Merewether (at Dennarque), describing the scene as he reached this block which today is at the top of the Lithgow Zig Zag: Here is direct evidence of the pattern already apparent that Mount Wilson and the Blue Mountains had become the popular concept of a hill station, providing an escape from Sydney, Newcastle, Mulgoa and Mudgee to a cool, healthy, beautiful, mountainous environment during the hotter summer months for the families who built homes in Mount Wilson. When Dennarque was owned by the Mann children (1924+) a guesthouse was established. After World War 1 the small Mt.Wilson community underwent considerable social and economic change. Some property owners chose to live on the mountain permanently to make a living from its rich basalt soil. These permanent settlers were to include Richard Owen Wynne (grandson of Richard Wynne) of Wynstay, Edward Jesse Gregson (son of Jesse Gregson) of Yengo, George Ernest Valder (son of George Valder who had bought Nooroo in 1917-18), Ivie Sloan (of Bebeah, bought in 1902) and Frederick Farrell Mann of Yengo (called Stone Lodge after 1923 when he purchased it from Edward Gregson). Mt Wilson had acquired an attractive reputation for its rare beauty and its coolness in the summer and special environment bought visitors in small numbers. Tearooms and guesthouse accommodation emerged. An early map after World War 1 shows G Knight Brown running Campanella as a guesthouse (Wynne papers, Mitchell Library). Nooroo also had guests. In 1922 a post office building containing a residence and officer, was constructed in The Avenue opposite Bebeah through funds provided by a number of local property owners forming a trust. In this building was a tearoom and, for a short period, a small general store. An extract from \\"The Blue Mountains Echo\\" in 1921: > \\"A Tourist's Paradise\\" There is only one Mount Wilson in NSW - No other is > exactly like it - one of the principle glories of the Mount is its tree > ferns. They are everywhere on the mountain top, in the gullies out in the > sunlight.\\" The article describes the wonders of \\"Wynnestay its grounds are glorious, the beauty and diversity of foliage and form baffle description.\\" The guesthouses at Mt.Wilson became an attractive feature of holidaying in this rather isolated mountain retreat. They functioned on a modest scale bringing a rather select group of visitors. Meanwhile, a small number of property owners turned to orcharding to derive an income from this same mountain. Others, like the Whites of Withycombe, continued to use it as a summer retreat (Reynolds, 2009, 1,4-8, abridged) Following the death of Colonel R.O. Wynne on 24 September 1968, his widow, Florence Mariamne Wynne, Sons Mervyn Owen and Ronald Michael Wynne and daughter Jane Mariamne Smart became the new owners of the estate. On 3 May 1972 following the death of Colonel Wynne's widow, the three children inherited the estate. Gowan Ross Pty Ltd., established by the Smart family, purchased the estate.Design 5 Architects 1999 s polythene-clad tunnel houses in a nursery area east of the house were built by Bill Smart for use by the family nurseries. These were built on the site of the old tennis court. Bill Smart was interested in contemporary horticulture. Historic notes: The property of Wynstay somprses the largest land holding in the town Mount Wilson. Richard Wynne, a successful Sydney businessman, built MOunt Wilson's first cottage, which he named Wynstay, in 1875. Wynne set out to establish a park-like estate on the property in the English pictureesue tradition. To this end he acquired the largest land holding in Mount Wilson, on top of a hill that is now a dominant position in the settlement. Wynne built a second and larger cottage. Yarawwa, and later a larger U-shaped timber residence with a verandah on the three sides. This structure seerved the needs of the Wynne family until 1923 when Richard Wynne's grandson built the present Wynstay, a large sandstone house in the Georgian Revival style. The property is today owned by Mr & Mrs Smart; Mrs Smart is a direct descendant of Richard Wynne.  Description  =Estate and grounds= The estate comprises the top of the hill at Mount Wilson, ending the axial view up the Avenue, its main street, and skirted by the road which winds to the east and west around Wynstay. This ability to be read in the round gives the estate much of its visual power and presence, with open space, a rich collection of mostly exotic 19th century tree plantings including a number of rare and unusual conifers, and built elements such as the Turkish Bathouse and hexagonal stone gate house are visible as incidents in the foliage or view from the road. A series of drives and roads within the estate edged by c.1m tall crenellated rubble stone walls approach the main house via the Turkish Bath (western driveway), and more indirectly via a southern driveway which winds around the brow of the hilltop past stables, old Wynstay, the cottage and Gate House. Plantings define field edges and garden \\"rooms\\" within this large area, in a most picturesque composition, no doubt deliberately intended to display Wynne's wealth and taste. Elements of the estate include grazing fields, inner and outer garden areas, paved \\"courtyard\\" spaces both near the house and further out (south) in the garden, linking paths between buildings, and a more recent service and propagation area of polythene tube or tunnel houses east of the main house and on a lower terrace.Read, S., 8/2004 Key tree, shrub and other plantings include: *Abies normanniana, Caucasian fir, fine specimen west of house on lawn; *Picea smithiana, Himalayan spruce (2: one near the house; one near the stables block/Old Wynstay); *Illicium anisatum, five spice bush; *Daphne odora cv.'Rubra' and \\"Alba\\", pink and white daphne; *Viburnum davidii; *V.tinus, laurustinus; *Chamaecyparis lawsoniana, Lawson's false cypress (several, very large - one behind (south of) the house is multi-trunked as its lower branches have rooted in the ground and their tips have kept growing forming a circular grove; *New Zealand species such as: *Pittosporum eugenioides, tarata/lemonwood; *Corokia cotoneaster, korokio; *Cordyline australis, ti kauka/cabbage tree; *Libocedrus plumosa, kawaka/native cedar (several, in pairs, planted formally); *Griselinia lucida, puka/broadleaf; *Nothofagus fusca, red beech; *Pinus griffithii/P.wallichiana, Bhutan pine (long needles, 20‚Äì30 cm cone, curved, hanging); *P.ponderosa, Western yellow pine; *Picea abies \\"Inversa\\", dwarf drooping Norway spruce - on a raised driveway bed near the Turkish Bath House; *Cedrus deodara, Himalayan cedar; *C.atlantica and C.a.'Glauca', Atlas and blue Atlas cedar (very tall specimen near the stables block); *Pinus ponderosa; *Cupressus macrocarpa, Monterey cypress (avenue/former windbreak?) adjoining the stables/central drive on hill top); *C.m.'Aurea', golden Monterey cypress *Araucaria bidwillii, Bunya Bunya pine (2); *Arbutus unedo, Mediterranean /'Irish' strawberry tree (several - almost a weed says the owner); *Sequoiadendron giganteum, redwood/big tree; *Sequoia sempervirens \\"Glauca\\", blue form of coastal redwood (2 in paddock); *Kalmia latifolia, calico bush (several); *Cornus Florida, Florida/eastern dogwood; *Cryptomeria japonica, tsugi/Japanese cedar; *C.j.'Vilmoriniana', dwarf \\"; *Hamamaelis mollis, witch hazel; *Erythronium dens-canis, dog-toothed violets; *Daphne cneorum; *D.odora \\"Albo-variegata\\", variegated daphne; *Magnolia grandiflora, evergreen magnolia/bull bay (large specimen); *M.denudata, Yulan tree; *M.x soulangeana, tree tulip; *M.x loebnerii (8 x 12m specimen); *Garrya elliptica, catkin bush; *Stachyurus praecox; *Prunus x serrulata cv.s, flowering cherries; *P.laurocerasus, cherry laurel; *Azalea mollis cv.s; deciduous/Mollis azaleas (many); *Rhododendron indicum cv.s, azaleas (many); *R.species (many, including R.ponticum; R.augustinii (blue); R.fragrantissimum (white, scented); *Pieris forrestii (giant lily-of-the-valley bush); *P.japonica & P.j.'Variegata' (\\" \\"); *Ilex aquifolium cv.s (hollies); *Hydrangea petiolaris, climbing hydrangea; *H.macrophylla cv.s, hydrangeas (many); *Tsuga canadensis \\"Pendula\\" (weeping hemlock); *Picea albertiana \\"Glauca Conica\\", dwarf spruce; *Euonymus pendula; *Picea mariana, black spruce (near/west of the house and the Caucasian fir)(closer to the driveway)). \\"Mimi's Garden / Italian Garden (walled garden south of the house): *Ivy (Hedera helix) clad mesh walls; *Florentine cast iron gates brought from Florence, Italy *a statue in the basin in the centre of the garden.

A good example of a late 19th c. Gothic style, weatherboard cottage used as an early mountain retreat (LEP). ;The Stables This is a fine example of the Federation Gothic style with Norman influences. The basalt and sandstone building features crennellated parapet walls. The building is in good condition and retains much of the original fabric and integrity. Behind (south of) the stables are a domed brick water tank and a horse gang. ;The Turkish Bath This is an example of the Federation Free Classical style with an infusion of Italianate stylising. Built pre-1890-93. The bricks were made by Wynne. The building is in good condition and retains a substantial proportion of original fabric and integrity. Recent research indicates the Turkish Bath house was built (well) before 1890 for use by Richard Wynne's wife Mary Anne, who had fallen into ill health and whose doctors had prescribed a course of Turkish baths. Mrs Wynne died in July 1889 of abdominal cancer.Previously it was assumed to have been built Surviving Turkish Bath Houses are extremely rare in Australia - Dunmore station in Western Victoria has one made of basalt, (Lewis, undated). ;The Lodge or Gatehouse This is a hexagonal-shaped Federation sandstone building with great emphasis placed on solar planning principles to admit natural light to a central core surrounding a fireplace. The building is intact and in good condition. A nearby stone wall appears to be remnant section of another early outbuilding / storage shed (close to the gates and lodge/gate house) which partially collapsed in 2009 (grant application, 1/2011) ;The Wynstay residence This is a two-storey, face sandstone building designed by Joseland & Gilling architects in the Inter-War Georgian Revival style. The original integrity and fabric of the building is superb. =Physical description= The property of Wynstay occupies a dominant position on top of a hill at the end of The Avenue at Mount Wilson. The original cottage Wynstay, and the second Wynstay, a U-Shaped timber residence surrounded on three sides by verandahs, still remain on the site. The main house Wynstay, a sandstone Georgian Revival manor house, is sited above the northern boundary of the property. The grounds of Wynstay are bordered by extensive stone walling which runs in a semicircle on the western side of the property. At the end of The Avenue are a set of stone gate posts incorporating decorative wrought iron work, and beside the main gate stands a pentagonal stone gate lodge. From the gate lodge run remnants of a carriage drive that continued along a terrace with almost a mile of rubble walling before arriving at the stables. The stables building is constructed on a U-Shaped plan and built randomly of coursed basalt with some dressed sandstone. This structure includes battlements and crenellations which match the stone walling which runs around the boundary of the garden. A Turkish bath house of decorative brickwork, wrought iron and ceramic floor tiles is sited below the northern wall of the garden. =Design elements= The garden is laid out in the style of an English park estate, in the picturesque or gardenesque style. The various structures (gate House, stables and Turkish bath house) serve as pictureesque elements in the garden of Wynstay. Richard Wynne's siting of these structures, and the three houses built in the grounds, did not address the spectacular views to the north of the property over the Wolleongambe Wilderness. The natural landscape was deliberatley kept separate from the picturesque garden that Wynne created within the circular walk which defines the garden and grounds. The main house, Wynstay of 1923, is however sited to address these views rather than the garden. The garden is dominated by mature conifers including Wellingtonia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), Lason Cyress(Chamaecyparis lawsonia), Himalayan Spruce (Picea smithiana) with specimen plantings of Caucasian (Abies nordmanniana) and Blue Atlas Cedar ( Cedrus atlantica 'glauca'). In the areas surrounding the garden are stands of Pinus radiata, Pinus macrocarpa and Pinus ponderosa. In addition, the garden contains many deciduous trees that provide a colourful display during autumn. These include Copper beech (Fangus sylvatica 'purpurea'). English Oak (Quercus robur), Pin Oak (Quercus palustris) and Red Oak (Quercus rubra), with numerous varieties of Maple, Chestnut, Magnolia, Cherry and Dogwood. The front of the old Wynstay cottage consists of mostly over-mature shrubbery. The surviving shrubs from this early period of garden development include Hydrangea hortensis. Viburnum davidii, Viburnum tinus, Ilex aquifolium (holly), Magnolia stellata (star magnolia), with varieties of Camelia, Buddleia, Deutzia, Exochordia and Laburnum. Azaleas also grow around the old cottage. These are mostly pink and white early Belgian hybrids of which the names are now lost. Other warly paintings wtill existing on the site are stands of Cordyline australis (NZ Cabbage tree/ti kouka), and an extensive understorey planting of an unnamed Rhododendron cultivar dating from the 1880s. Some garden ornament survives from the 1880s mostly of an Italiannate style, including a nineteenth century terracotta Venus figure. Two urns manufactured by Goodlet and Smith of Sydney front the stairs leading to the cottage. In the 1920s further ornament was incorporated. The old conservatory with its roof removed was developed as a walled garden that includes a large water tub planted with lotus, with a bronze cherub at its centre. A larger walled garden called the sunken garden was paved in brick. = Modifications and dates = *1875 first cottage built *1875-9: road to Mount Irvine resurfaced to skirt Wynstay's hilltop position on Mt.Wilson. *1875-93: second cottage \\"Yarrawa\\" built; stables, stone gate lodge, timber house (now called 'Old Wynstay') and much of the crenellated stone work estate walls were built. *3 September 1879: Wynne bought the redundant section of the old road (now the site of the gates, Old Wynstay and much of the stone walls). *1882: H.J.Wynne (Richard's son) bought portion 64 to the north of the old road by a Crown grant, which by this time was bisected by Mt.Irvine Road. *pre-1890-93: Turkish Bath House drawings done, implying it was built in this period. *1895 Richard Wynne died (his wife was dead already and of their five male children only H.J.Wynne was living (born 1859). *16 April 1896 Wynstay was held in trust *22 January 1898: H.J.Wynne died (children R.O.Wynne (b.1893) and D.M.Wynne (b.1895) were five and three respectively). *1906 Yarrawa burnt down. *18 December 1913 Colonel R.O.Wynne (Richard's grandson in England) became the new owner. * Col.Wynne came to Australia with his English bride. Work started on the present house, designed by Joseland & Gilling architects. The Turkish Bath house was converted into living quarters for three stonemasons building the new house. * the new house was completed (Nat.Trust (NSW) classification). *24 September 1968 Col.Wynne died and his three children inherited the estate. *s polythene-clad tunnel houses in a nursery area east of the house on site of old tennis court. *16 April 1996: Wynstay held in trust for heirs. *1996 Ornamental garden urn repaired with funding from Australian Garden History Society (Sydney & Northern NSW Branch). *2007: large Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara) probably c.1880s/1890s just beside Old Wynstay was hit by lightning in 2006, one of its trunks shattered and threatened to collapse on the old house. The tree was taken down in 2007 by Ryde TAFE arboriculture students. A nearby brick kiln was built when Jane Wynne and her classmates had lessons from Fred Mann, the potter of nearby Cherry Cottage. *May 2007: Another large tree, a blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon) collapsed in a storm on the back half of an old corrugated iron shed in the Wynstay paddock. The shed has always been called the blacksmith's shop. It is believed to have been used in Richard Wynne's time to create and repair tools and other farm equipment, decorative iron fences and railings. Installation of rainwater tank and stand beneath original tank stand providing a supply to the Turkish Bath house.Florence Smart, in Mt.Wilson & Mt.Irvine Historical Society, 2007, 2, 12-13 *2010: a new roof on the Turkish Bath, just this month; heavy duty galvanised steel specially rolled to the original profile at Fielders in Adelaide. The timber on the bath house tower also had a facelift.  Heritage listing  As at 7 April 2006, the Wynstay Estate, settled by Richard Wynne and comprising the original cottage, Old Wynstay, The Stables, The Turkish Bath, The Lodge, Wynstay residence and a large area of picturesque gardens, represents an early and highly intact Hill Station landscape estate with a remarkable collection of buildings in diverse architectural styles and a rich collection of plantings befitting Wynne's vision of an English park. Wynstay has aesthetic significance as its character, planning, and the quality of the architecture and landscaping unashamedly and deliberately seeks to establish the qualities of affluence and opulence; a private \\"retreat\\". The architectural styles, use of materials and the functionality of the buildings, along with the rich plant collection from trees, to shrubs, perennials, climbers and bulb layers successfully create an idealised, romantic and sometimes fanciful recreation of an English rural estate. Wynstay has historic significance to the locality as one of the early European hill station properties on Mount Wilson and is rare as a relatively intact, large original hill station remaining in the same original family's ownership. Of particular importance is the presence of the first Gothic style cottage built by Richard Wynne, the larger Victorian cottage Yarrawa / Old Wynstay, and the 1923 sandstone house that demonstrate progressive development of the site by the Wynne family from the late 19th to the early 20th century. The garden elements such as the stone and wrought iron gates, crenellated rubble dry stone walling and stables, Turkish Bath House and collection of specimen trees, avenues, dell and sunken garden demonstrate extraordinary richness rare in gardens of this period.National Trust, 1994, modified, Read, S., 2004 Wynstay has historic significance due to its association and establishment by Richard Wynne, a prosperous merchant who became a prominent citizen of Victorian Sydney, whose descendants continue ownership of the property.Register of National Estate (from nominators), modified Read, S., 8/2004 Wynstay Estate was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 12 April 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. As a rare substantially intact example of a gentlemen's \\"Hill Station\\" retreat, owned and occupied almost continuously by the one family since its establishment in 1870, the Wynstay estate is of State significance. As possibly the oldest surviving building in Mt Wilson, the cottage is of local significance. (Design 5 Architects) Evidence of adaptation and change manifest in the buildings, artefacts and landscape is of significance as a record of changing tastes and technologies from 1870 to the present day. It may also have greater significance as evidence of particular events in the Wynne family history. (Design 5 Architects) The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Wynstay Estate was established by Richard Wynne, a prosperous merchant who became a prominent citizen in Sydney and at one time the Mayor of Burwood municipality. Wynne was a pioneer settler of Mount Wilson and also the founder of the Wynne Prize for Landscape Painting and Sculpture at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. As evidence of Wynne's occupation of the site and his personal vision of an ideal landscape, the estate is of State significance. (Design 5 Architects) The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Turkish Bath is a rare intact example of a purpose built private Turkish Bath in Australia, and survives substantially intact. The building is an unusually fine example of late Victorian boom style architecture with polychrome brickwork and Italianate details. The evidence of its operation is of high technological significance and is extremely rare in Australia, possibly unique. Interest in Turkish Baths in Australia appears to have developed shortly after their reintroduction in England (into Ireland in 1860 then later in the north of England: the first introduction to England was in the 17th century). In the late 19th century, two public Turkish Baths were known to have operated in Sydney, and two in Melbourne. Only one other surviving private Turkish Bath is known in Australia, on Dunmore station near Broadwater in Victoria.Design 5 Architects Wynstay (the house) is a handsome, robust example of inter war Georgian Revival architecture, designed by the prominent Sydney architectural firm, Joseland & Gilling. As a significant group of buildings, structures, artefacts and gardens set in the mountain landscape in the romantic style, the Wynstay estate is of local aesthetic significance. The gate lodge and stables are significant examples of 19th century pattern book architecture. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Evidence of adaptation and change manifest in the buildings, artefacts and landscape is of significance as a record of changing tastes and technologies from 1870 to the present day. It may also have greater significance as evidence of particular events in the Wynne family history. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Wynstay as a hill station property of some scale remaining in the same original family is now rare in New South Wales. In addition, surviving Turkish Bath Houses are extremely rare in Australia - Dunmore station in Western Victoria has one made of basalt, .Lewis, undated.

H. The Early Actinides: the Periodic System‚Äôs f Electron Transition Metal Series, in Plutonium 1970 and Other Actinides (AIME, New York, 1970). These atoms own partially filled 4f or 5f levels in their valence shell and are therefore responsible for the main interaction between each atom and its environment. In this context, the hill limit r_H is defined as twice the radius of the f-orbital. Therefore, if two atoms of the lattice are separate by a distance greater than the Hill limit, the overlap of their f-orbital becomes negligible. A direct consequence is the absence of hopping for the f electrons, ie their localization on the ion sites of the lattice. Localized f electrons lead to paramagnetic materials since the remaining unpaired spins are stuck in their orbitals. However, when the rare- earth lattice (or a single atom) is embedded in a metallic one (intermetallic compound), interactions with the conduction band allow the f electrons to move through the lattice even for interatomic distances above the Hill limit.

Stratigraphic paleobiology studies how the fossil record is altered by sedimentological processes and how this affects biostratigraphy and paleobiological interpretations of the fossil record.  Topic and key concepts  Patzkowsky and Holland (2012) define stratigraphic paleobiology as follows: \\"[Stratigraphic paleobiology] is built on the premise that the distribution of fossil taxa in time and space is controlled not only by processes of evolution, ecology, and environmental change, but also by the stratigraphic processes that govern where and when sediment that might contain fossils is deposited and preserved. Teasing apart the effects of these two suites of processes to understand the history of life on Earth is the essence of stratigraphic paleobiology.\\" Large parts of stratigraphic paleobiology rely on sequence stratigraphy. This is since within a sequence, many parameters such as depositional conditions, (non)preservation, and facies change deterministically. This sequence stratigraphic background alone, without any changes in ecology or any evolutionary processes, creates a baseline of constant change in the number of fossils and taxa that are preserved. One example for this are maximum flooding surfaces, which commonly display large accumulations of shells and an increased number of first fossil occurrences and last fossil occurrences. This is however not necessary linked to any change in ecology or an extinction event, but can be generated by the low deposition rates during the maximum flooding surface alone.

It aired on October 31, 2018, on the cable network FX. The episode was written by Josh Green, and directed by Bradley Buecker. Plot Michael Langdon realizes Ariel Augustus, Baldwin Pennypacker, and Miriam Mead have been executed. He is then confronted by Cordelia Goode, who tells him that she has prevented Michael from resurrecting Mead, but also insists that Michael still has capacity for good. Michael dismisses her, threatening to kill every witch. Wandering into a forest, the distressed Michael draws a pentagram on the ground with a rock. Pleading to his Father for guidance, he threatens to remain in the forest until he has received a message. Four days pass; a weak and starving Michael sees visions of a cherubic little girl offering him an apple and a beautiful young man with angel's wings, who tells him that God loves him. It is ambiguous as to whether these are angelic messengers or hallucinations. Eventually Michael is confronted by a black goat. Asking if the animal is his father, Michael stabs the goat to death, and a snake emerges from its severed head. Weakened, Michael stumbles across a Satanic church. The High Priestess, Hannah, berates her fellow worshippers for their relatively unimpressive feats of sin, believing that the world must become significantly wicked in order to encourage the arrival of the Antichrist. A member of the congregation, Madelyn, takes pity on Michael, observing that he is undernourished and lost. After Church she takes him home with her to recover. At Madelyn's home, Madelyn claims to have everything she wants because she sold her soul to Satan. Michael mocks her for her views and she attempts to kill him until he presents the mark of the beast on the back of his neck, proving himself as the Antichrist. Back at the church, Hannah presents two people for sacrifice when Madelyn interrupts and presents Michael, who confirms his identity and is hailed by the congregation. Michael proceeds to kill the two people offered up for sacrifice. The congregation hosts a dinner for Michael, who admits that he has no plan for bringing about the apocalypse. Madelyn offers her services to him, but Michael tells her he only desires Mead's resurrection. Madelyn takes Michael to a robotics company run by two cocaine-addicted Satanists, Jeff and Mutt. Wilhemina Venable is revealed to be Jeff and Mutt's PA. Michael is mocked by Jeff and Mutt for being unintimidating, until he uses his powers to immolate a prostitute. Jeff and Mutt pledge themselves to Michael, who presents them with the task of recreating Mead. Mead's android replica is presented to Michael; she wakes and immediately recognizes Michael. Reception \\"Sojourn\\" was watched by 1.63 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 0.7 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49. The episode received mixed reviews. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \\"Sojourn\\" holds a 50% approval rating, based on 16 reviews with an average rating of 8/10. The critical consensus reads, \\"'Sojourn' saves itself from being a completely confusing bridge episode, thanks to a refocus on the existential sadness of Satan's spawn and a killer monologue from Sandra Bernhardt.\\" Ron Hogan of Den of Geek gave the episode a 3/5, saying, \\"Michael's trip back into the arms of the Church of Satan is one of the funniest things I've seen on American Horror Story. In true Satanic fashion, the gathering of Satan's flock of goats is essentially a mockery of a standard church service, with an offering plate being passed around and a sermon being delivered by the high Priestess (a really funny Sandra Bernhard).\\" He added, \\"Bradley Buecker does a good job at getting a sense of weariness out of the actors in the services. [...] no one seems to be having a very good time with what they're doing until they get a chance to show off for someone else. Otherwise, they're clearly bored, and trying to keep just busy enough to keep from getting yelled at.\\" Kat Rosenfield from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+. She mentioned that some scenes were too confusing, especially the one where Michael experiences hallucinations and the one where the satanists are trying to please him with food. However, she appreciated that the episode gave finally some explanations about the post-apocalypse events of the season's first three episodes. She particularly enjoyed the appearance of Ms. Venable and the \\"true origin story of Robot Mead\\". Overall, she commented that it was \\"an extra- kooky, campy episode of AHS: Apocalypse\\", and that she was a big fan of Sandra Bernhard's appearance and performance. Vultures Ziwe Fumudoh gave the episode a 4 out of 5. Much like Rosenfield, she did not understand the scene where Michael experiences hallucinations, calling it a \\"weird acid trip\\". She was also confused by Michael's attitude during the episode, but admitted that \\"I understand that sometimes depression makes people not act like themselves, even when that \\"self\\" is Satan's spawn\\". However, she was extremely pleased by the return of Ms. Venable, saying that \\"The best part of American Horror Story is seeing Sarah Paulson in 19 different wigs this season.\\" She also enjoyed the final scene as it was \\"setting the scene for the plot of Apocalypse to come full circle.\\" References External links * Category:American Horror Story: Apocalypse episodes ","title":"Sojourn (American Horror Story)"},{"id":"58600231","text":"Zhou Yinan (; born 6 December 1983) is a Chinese rower.

Despite strict orders not to commit any violence against civilians in the aftermath of the Italian surrender on 8 September 1943, members of the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler murdered 56, predominantly Italian and Greek, Jews. Many of the bodies were sunk into the lake to prevent discovery but one washed ashore in neighbouring Switzerland, drawing international attention to the massacre and prompting an inconclusive divisional inquiry. It is commonly referred to as the first German massacre of Jews in Italy during World War II. The war crime was subject of a trial in West Germany in 1968 in which five of the accused were found guilty but later controversially released after a verdict by the German high court which ruled that the statute of limitations for the case had expired. Prelude Following the Italian surrender on 8 September 1943 the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler was stationed in northern Italy, having recently returned from the Eastern Front. At this point the division had strict orders not to commit any violence against civilians. Despite this, a unit of the division under Joachim Peiper committed the Boves massacre on 19 September in retaliation to the capture of two German soldiers and murdered 23 civilians despite the release of the two soldiers. Despite having no authorisation or orders to do so the division hunted down Jewish refugees attempting to escape the former Italian occupation zone in France who were trying to find safety in Italy. The division arrested and executed Jews and looted Jewish property and, eventually, was ordered to stop this practice by SS-corps commander Paul Hausser who had made it clear that the arrest of Jews and confiscation of their property was exclusively reserved for the security police and the Sicherheitsdienst. Massacres Map of Lake Maggiore from the 1930s with the locations of the massacres underlined red Immediately after the Italian surrender a battalion of the Leibstandarte was stationed on the western side of Lake Maggiore to assist with the disarming of the Italian Army. A number of Jewish families lived in the villages on this side of the lake, some of them Jewish Greek refugees, others Italian Jews which had escaped the cities. Their identity and location was passed on to the Germans by local Italian Fascists. Members of the division arrested over 50 of those and held them in a number of local hotels. The best- known of these massacres was that of the sixteen prisoners held at the Hotel Meina, at Meina. On 19 September the involved officers of the division held a meeting in which it was decided to shoot the Jewish men, women and children and to sink their bodies into the lake. The Jewish prisoners were taken in small groups from their hotels at night on 22 and 23 September and taken to a local forest where they were shot. The bodies were then placed in sacks filled with stones, rowed out in boats and sunk in the lake. A number of other Jewish prisoners were murdered and then buried in mass graves. Only very few of the prisoners escaped, with one family surviving because of their Turkish passports and assistance from the Turkish consul who arranged passage to Switzerland for them. Apart from the sixteen murders at Meina on 22 and 23 September, fourteen Jews were killed at Baveno between 14 and 22 September, two at Pian Di Nava, near Premeno, on 15 September and nine at Arona, three at Mergozzo and two at Orta San Giulio on 16 September. The following day, 17 September, four Jews were killed at Stresa. In October 1943, members of the same battalion murdered the Jewish banker Ettore Ovazza and three of his family members at Itra, near Verbania, also on the Lake Maggiore, and buried the bodies. The exact number of victims varies, but at least 50 Greek and Italian Jews were murdered by the division in September and October 1943 during the Lake Maggiore massacres, and as many as 56 victims are stated in what has been described as the first German massacre of Jews in Italy during World War II. Aftermath Swiss newspaper article on the events from 23 October 1943 The case received international attention after one of the bodies washed ashore in Switzerland and the case was reported in a local Swiss newspaper. This forced an investigation into the events by two judges of the Leibstandarte division. While members of the division were interviewed no outcome has been recorded and the division was soon moved back to the Eastern Front. Trials Five members of the Leibstandarte, Hans Kr√ºger, Herbert Schnelle, Hans Roehwer, Oskar Schultz and Ludwig Leithe, were charged by a court in Osnabr√ºck in 1968 with 22 cases of murder. The court found the first three guilty of murder and sentenced them for life while the other two received a jail sentence of three years as accessories in the crime. The case was taken to Germany's high court, the Bundesgerichtshof, which ruled that, while not overturning the guilty verdict, that the perpetrators had to be freed on a technicality. As the crime had been committed in 1943 and was actually investigated by the division already back then, also without a conclusion, the usual start date for statute of limitations for Nazi crimes, the date of the German surrender in 1945, did not apply, meaning the 1943 massacre's statute of limitations had been expired. This verdict caused much frustration in Germany with a younger generation of state prosecutors which were actually interest in prosecuting Nazi crimes and their perpetrators. For the murder of the Ovazza family, Austrian SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer Gottfried Meir was charged in 1954 in Klagenfurt but found not guilty. He was however convicted in absentia by a military court in Turin in 1955 and sentenced for life but never extradited. In popular culture The events and massacre at Hotel Meina were made into a movie in 2007. The movie sparked controversy as it deviated from the book source of the story, written by Marco Nozza, and also from the real events. It was accused for portraying the Germans in a positive light. Becky Behar Ottolenghi, daughter of the hotel owner and an eyewitness to the events, thirteen years old at the time, published her memory of the events in a book titled The Forgotten Massacre.

She had been on her way home from a three-hour lecture at Griffith University where she was studying her Masters of Business. On 7 April Australian citizen Benjamin James Milward from Ipswich, Queensland was arrested and charged with her murder and rape.

Retrieved 28 September 2018Sophie Collombet: Family arrives for sentencing of killer Benjamin Milward . Retrieved 28 September 2018 He had been using the illegal drug \\"ice\\" at the time of her murder. The case attracted adverse commentary about Australian society as Collombet was believed to be still alive when Milward left her; a number of people had walked past her naked body, which was covered with newspapers and Milward's jacket, but took no action believing her to be a homeless person, many of whom slept in that area. It was a homeless person who eventually checked on Collombet and found no pulse; CPR was attempted without success. Police were also criticised for failing to make the Kurilpa Point Park a safe place despite a number of recent crimes reported there. The park is beside the Brisbane River immediately between the busy William Jolly Bridge and the Gallery of Modern Art at the northern end of the Queensland Cultural Precinct. A popular riverbank walking/cycling track passes through the park. On 10 April 2014, over 2,000 people participated in a march and candlelight vigil in memory of Collombet. The march commenced at King George Square in front of Brisbane City Hall with speeches and then proceeded to the Kurilpa Point Park where the candlelight vigil was held. The organisers of the march said one of the purposes of the march was \\"to show that Brisbane cares about violence against women‚Äù. There was also criticism of the location () of a Catholic Ozcare hostel for homeless men and those recently paroled from prison for offences including murder and rape as being too close to Brisbane's major cultural precinct. Milward had been living at the hostel but had failed to return by the curfew on the night of the murder. He had obtained the drug \\"ice\\" which fuelled his attack on Collombet from another resident of the hostel. Sophie Collombet was buried back in her hometown of Saint-Julien-Mont- Denis a commune in the Savoie department in the Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes region in south-eastern France. Her funeral was a large event where 1200 villagers took part in a grant funeral procession behind her casket with a 120-piece brass band playing Chopin‚Äôs mournful Marche Funebre (funeral march).

He is the son of Javier Torres F√©lix (alias \\"El JT\\"), a former leader of the Sinaloa Cartel who worked under Ismael \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada, one of Mexico's most-wanted men. In addition to his involvement in organized crime, he held a government post as syndic for a rural community in Cosal√°, Sinaloa. He was the only candidate to run for this position, and held the role for less than a year. Torres Urrea first came to public attention in 2008, when the Mexican Army discovered a photo of him with uncle Manuel Torres F√©lix (alias \\"El M1\\") following a raid in one of his uncle's ranches. At the scene they also discovered multiple assault rifles, drugs, an armored vehicle, among other suspicious belongings. Since then investigators have linked him to the Sinaloa Cartel and considered him one of the 122 most-wanted men in Mexico. In 2014, Torres Urrea was arrested by the Army in Culiac√°n, Sinaloa, and imprisoned at the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 2, a maximum-security prison in Jalisco, where he serves a nine- year sentence. Personal life Misael Torres Urrea, commonly referred to by his alias El M2, was born on to Javier Torres Felix (alias \\"El JT\\") and Agapita Urrea. He had at least four siblings: Joel Torres Jim√©nez (sometimes spelled Joel Torres Urrea), Mar√≠a Luisa Torres Urrea, Marisol Torres Urrea, and Jes√∫s Javier Torres Urrea. His father was a high-ranking member of the Sinaloa Cartel, a criminal group based in Sinaloa. El JT worked directly under Ismael \\"El Mayo\\" Zambada, one of Mexico's most-wanted men, along with his brother Manuel Torres F√©lix (alias \\"El M1\\"). El JT was arrested in 2004 and extradited to the U.S. in 2006, where he was convicted of drug trafficking. Multiple members of the Torres clan were involved in drug trafficking; some of them, including Torres Urrea's father, siblings, uncles, and cousins, have been killed by security forces, rival criminal groups, or arrested for their alleged involvement in organized crime. Torres Urrea was active on social media and uploaded content on Facebook and Twitter. Between 2008 and 2013, he uploaded pictures of his personal life, family, hobbies, and Christian beliefs; his activity on social media was closely monitored by journalists and investigators. He had pictures of himself with his daughter while hunting deer, fishing, and in religious sites. One of the pictures he took showed him posing in front of nativity of Jesus monument. Another one showed him at a site of Our Lady of Guadalupe. During his Valentine's Day, he uploaded the exorbitant gifts he gave to his wife Karen L√≥pez. The picture showed fifteen balloons, two iPhone boxes, a Gucci purse, two dogs, a box of Godiva Chocolatier, and other undisclosed presents. He also uploaded pictures of his political campaign and displayed the party colors of red and green, suggesting he was probably supported by either the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) or the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM), which have those party colors. According to government files, Torres Urrea was also a registered beneficiary of Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (Sagarpa) and was on file as a bovinae producer. In 2011, he received MXN$7,200 from the Component for the Attention of Natural Disasters (CADENA) program. The following year, he received MXN$4,950 from the Livestock Productivity Stimulus Program (PROGRAN), where he was also registered as a producer of bovine meat in the village of Llanos del Refugio in Cosal√°.  Criminal career  On 20 September 2008, the Mexican Army raided a ranch owned by Torres Urrea's uncle in El Carrizal, a village close to El Salado in Culiac√°n Municipality. The operative began after they noticed a vehicle trying to flee from them and heading towards the property in an apparent attempt to let the occupants know of law enforcement's presence. Investigators stated that the occupants left the scene before the Army arrived. However, once authorities arrived at the scene, they discovered the following items: thirteen assault rifles, 4,894 cartridges, a 40 mm grenade, five bullet-proof vests and one bullet-proof jacket, an armored vehicle, uniforms from the Sinaloa State Police, military camouflage pants, a cash counting machine, radio communication equipment, and approximately of cocaine and of marijuana. In addition, authorities discovered a photograph of El M1 and Torres Urrea. With this photograph, Mexico's Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR) decided to open a case against Torres Urrea in order to investigate him for his possible links to the Sinaloa Cartel and its leadership structure. The photo showed El M1 and Torres Urrea hugging shoulder to shoulder; Torres Urrea was sporting a side bag with a grenade attached to it and a handgun tucked to his belt just like his uncle. The Army leaked the picture to the press later that day, and it gained popularity on social media and among several narcocorrido (drug ballad) composers, including the Mexican music producer group El Movimiento Alterado, which used this photo to promote its songs. The leak was first time that Torres Urrea was publicly displayed. With his father in prison, Torres Urrea reportedly succeed his role as a top operator within the Sinaloa Cartel and worked alongside his uncle El M1 and in-law Ra√∫l Meza Ontiveros. This meant that Torres Urrea allegedly worked under El Mayo. According to Renato Salas Heredia, the head of Mexico's National Security Commission (CNS) (es), Torres Urrea was one of Mexico's 122 most-wanted criminals. Another of his family members on the list was In√©s Enrique Torres Acosta, his cousin and son of El M1.  Political career  Torres Urrea ran for a syndic position in La Ilama, a rural community in Cosal√°, Sinaloa. He won the elections in March 2014 after being the only candidate to run for the position. He was paid MXN$10,000 every month and among his responsibilities were to help citizens during natural disasters. According to Cosal√° mayor Samuel Zacar√≠as Liz√°rraga Valverde, Torres Urrea legally met all the requirements for the position; since he did not have a criminal record at a state and municipal level, he was eligible to run for office. The mayor also stated that the municipal government open the position to its citizens and said they could not control the amount of applicants interested in the role. When asked about his relationship with Torres Urrea, the mayor clarified that he only met him the day Torres Urrea went to register as a candidate; he clarified that he knew the other syndics in Cosal√° from years back. He also stated that his arrest would not cause disruptions in the municipal projects Torres Urrea was working on because there were other Cosal√° officials working in them and were managing them more directly. In an interview with the press, state official Gerardo Vargas Landeros discarded the possibility that Torres Urrea had any criminals links with Liz√°rraga Valverde, and stated that he was not aware of any investigations by the PGR against the mayor, although he did not discard the possibility that one could arise as a result of Torres Urrea's arrest. When questioned about Torres Urrea's syndic eligibility, he stated that Torres Urrea presented a criminal background check form and came out clear at a state and municipal level. He said that it was up to federal authorities to determine if Torres Urrea was guilty of the criminal activities he was accused of. When registering as a candidate, Torres Urrea did not mention his political affiliation since the syndic position is mostly apolitical and is a citizen-driven position. He concluded the interview by stating that he did not believe that Torres Urrea's arrest damaged Sinaloa's political image. The case reached the Governor of Sinaloa, Mario L√≥pez Valdez, who stated that he did not know Torres Urrea and was not aware that he was son of El JT, the former leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. He said it was complicated for the state government to investigate the family ties of all its residents. Sinaloa's Noroeste newspaper criticized the government for claiming to be unaware of Torres Urrea's family background since the picture that showed him with his uncle El M1 had been circulating years prior to his election. He also clarified that he was not aware that Torres Urrea was wanted by the federal government. When questioned about the mayor's possible connection with Torres Urrea, the governor stated that he would not investigate him because Torres Urrea met the legal requirements to become a syndic. He stated that the state government would consider implementing a process to research state officials' backgrounds in more detail to determine their criminal history before they run for office. Journalists also questioned L√≥pez Valdez for a picture Torres Urrea took posing next to an AgustaWestland AW119 Koala state-owned helicopter used by the Sinaloa State Police. L√≥pez Valdez responded by stating that as a part of their official duties, syndics often collaborate with security forces. He said that picture was likely taken in the Cosalazo, an annual off-road driving event in Sinaloa, and that it was not uncommon for civilians to take such pictures during public events. He clarified that Torres Urrea was likely participating as a local representative during the Cosalazo because the event is state-sponsored and many residents of Cosal√° and elsewhere attend every year. He concluded the interview by saying that the state government did not believe that Torres Urrea used his syndic position to further his alleged criminal activities. Raid and arrest On 2 October 2014, Torres Urrea was arrested following a raid at his home in Camino Real neighborhood in Culiac√°n. The operative was carried out at 4:00 a.m. by members of the Mexican Army and the Subprocuradur√≠a Especializada en Investigaci√≥n de Delincuencia Organizada (SEIDO), Mexico's organized crime investigatory agency. Three Army vehicles were used in the operation. One of them blocked the road to prevent other vehicles from accessing the street while others raided the property to apprehend Torres Urrea. When security forces forced their way into the property, Torres Urrea woke up and told his wife to go to their daughter's room and remain together. Torres Urrea was tied up on a chair while investigators searched his belongings. They took several weapons registered under the Army, money, and jewelry. By 8:00 am, other federal agents arrived at the scene and began questioning him on what he did for a living, where he kept his money, drugs, weapons, and what other houses he had. Neighbors reported that they heard gunshots during the operative. Investigators later confirmed that there were no injuries. Security forces remained at Torres Urrea's home for most of the afternoon. They had breakfast and lunch at the scene while investigators conducted additional searches and continued their proceedings. Authorities confirmed that they also raided another house in Chapultepec neighborhood in Culiac√°n that they thought was linked to Torres Urrea. They claimed that multiple calls to Torres Urrea's home in Camino Real were made from this property. However, they were not able to officially confirm this information nor any links to Torres Urrea, and left the premises shortly after raiding it. At noon, investigators allowed Mar√≠a Luisa and Agapita, Torres Urrea's sister and mother, to enter the property and confirm that Torres Urrea was fine. The Army set up several checkpoints in the neighborhood to supervise those in the area, and would momentarily stop and search vehicles they thought looked suspicious. Several suspected Sinaloa Cartel scouts and Torres Urrea's family members surveilled the nearby area throughout the entire day, but only neighbors living in the same street where Torres Urrea lived were allowed to access the street while the officers were stationed there. By 7:30, they put Torres Urrea in handcuffs and took him to the Culiac√°n International Airport. He was transported by at least 30 law enforcement officers and in a military convoy. Torres Urrea's family and friends followed the convoy to the airport. He was then transported to Mexico City and placed under preventative arrest. L√≥pez and their six-year-old daughter were kept under custody and released hours later. Torres Urrea arrived at the SIEDO installations at 5:30 a.m. the following morning, where he gave his first legal declaration. The judge he faced charged him with organized crime involvement and for being in possession of a small quantity of narcotics. Torres Urrea's family stated that they did not trust the Army and that they were going to sue them for reportedly stealing multiple of his belongings from his home during the raid.  Imprisonment and conviction  Torres Urrea was imprisoned at the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 2 (also known as \\"Puente Grande\\"), a maximum-security prison in Jalisco. On 6 October 2014, Torres Urrea's sister Marisol and wife issued a writ of amparo at a court in Sinaloa requesting for Torres Urrea's release. The request stated that Torres Urrea was subject to cruel and unusual punishment, a violation of Article 22 of the Constitution of Mexico. They stated he was beaten, tortured, and kept away from communicating with his family. The judge who presided over the case reached out to officials responsible for raids, arrest warrants, and preventative detentions. The writ of amparo also reached the Mexican Navy, the Mexican Air Force, the Army, and the PGR. The presiding judge, however, denied the request on 24 October 2014. On 3 May 2017, Torres Urrea was sentenced to nine years in prison for drug trafficking and illegal possession of military-exclusive weaponry. He was ordered to pay MXN$6,377 in fines. The PGR had initially charged him with money laundering as well, but they did not provide evidence to the prosecution, which only moved forward with the first two charges mentioned. On 15 May 2018, the PGR was able to provide evidence of money laundering and issued a formal charge against Torres Urrea. The defendant appealed the motion, but a judge denied the request in August 2018. The defense issued another appeal, but this one was denied as well. According to the PGR, the day Torres Urrea was arrested, authorities discovered he had MXN$409,200 and US$10,430 in cash. They were not able to confirm the origin of the money and suspect it came from illicit activities. Torres Urrea said it came from his cattle business. On 28 November 2018, a judge from a Mexico City penal court denied Torres Urrea's request to move him from Puente Grande to Penal de Aguaruto, a lower security prison in Culiac√°n. The transfer request was denied because of his criminal background, his social adaptability in prison, and for his familial ties with other members of the Sinaloa Cartel. The judge acknowledged that the prison conditions in Culiac√°n were not adequate for a high-profile criminal like Torres Urrea because of the prison breaks reported in the facility.

It is a spin-off of the main series Kaiji by Nobuyuki Fukumoto. It has been published in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine since December 2016. Part of the manga was adapted as segmented episodes within the Mr. Tonegawa: Middle Management Blues anime series. A drama CD was featured with the DVD/Blu-ray Disc release of the series in March 2019. Story The story follows ≈åtsuki, the foreman of Squad E in the underground forced labor camp for people in debt, as he uses one-day outside passes to leave the camp for a day. Usually, each trip involves food or drink in some way. Characters =Main Characters= ; : :The main character of the story. He is the foreman of Squad E in the underground labor facility. While it is unknown where he is from, he speaks with a mixture of Kansai, Ch≈´goku and Shikoku dialects. He is a cunning individual who uses the privilege of being a foreman to profit from selling beer, sweets, and other goods, as well as a series of big cheating victories in the underground cee-lo games he hosts, and accumulates large amounts of perica (a currency that is only used underground) that he has taken from the prisoners. He frequently purchases \\"One-Day Outside Passes\\", a work incentive option, with the perica he earns. Though he is a skilled craftsman who can enjoy a day out without a care in the world using his accumulated experience and skills, he does not seem to want to permanently escape from the underground. He is portrayed as quite the gourmet in the story, and most of his outings are spent eating and sometimes going to public baths, exercise and short trips for refreshment. While he knows a number of good restaurants, he is cautious about choosing new places and menus to avoid getting a bad deal and having that regret linger for days, so he draws on his own observations and experiences in the areas he visits for the first time. When the mood is just right, he goes out for a drink at side street bars and enjoys socializing with strangers. Although his age is not specified, he explains that he was a college student in Tokyo 25 years prior (he lived a poor, simple life while working hard in a student band, and his favorite Chinese food restaurant at the time was in Kinshicho) and then worked as a company employee, but his appearance has changed little since his high school days, with the exception of his hair. ; : :≈åtsuki's close aide. He is 35 years old and from Miyazaki Prefecture. He is emphasized as a \\"worldly-wise man\\" and \\"straight man\\" character who is pushed around by the actions of ≈åtsuki and Isawa. Initially, he wasn't used to one-day outings and struggled to enjoy them. For this reason, he idolizes ≈åtsuki, who enjoys his own dexterity, and often goes out of his way to match ≈åtsuki's scheduled outings. In chapter 32, he becomes dissatisfied with ≈åtsuki and Isawa for unknown reasons and goes on a sulking hunger strike (refusing to talk, eat or drink). ≈åtsuki managed to put him back in a good mood, but Isawa's words and actions ended up adding fuel to the fire. Angered, he tried to return to the underground on his own before the time was up, but in the end he made up with ≈åtsuki and Isawa through Miyamoto's tearful persuasion. In the special episode \\"One-Day Private Room Numakawa,\\" he starts out happily enjoying the suite room he was sent to, which resembles a Japanese hotel, but soon finds himself bored and unsure of how to spend his time. The karaoke he asked for at the last minute was more fulfilling than he expected, and he sang Sakuranbo and other songs with great enthusiasm. However, ≈åtsuki and Isawa made fun of him later because they could hear his voice from outside the suite. ; : :≈åtsuki's close aide. He is 34 years old (he celebrates his birthday in chapter 29). He is emphasized as a \\"comic relief\\" and \\"trickster\\" character who baffles ≈åtsuki and Numakawa with his explosive, optimistic personality and his self-centered behavior and actions. He was able to hit it off and work together with ≈åtsuki thanks to their mutual love for the Bakumatsu era. He is also easily moved to tears, such as crying at the graveside of Sakamoto Ry≈çma and at the end of a documentary about animals. His family lived close to the ocean, so he knows a lot about fishing and has been doing it since he was a child. In chapter 73, he was the only one happy about the temporary suspension of underground work due to the new virus. ; : :A young blacksuit who serves as the underground's overseer and has been with Teiai for six years. He is 30 years old and from Hakodate, living in a mansion on his own. Initially, he showed a strong distrust of ≈åtsuki, who continued to win unnaturally in underground cee-lo. However, his self-control is provoked by a tour of the local government's showroom where he accompanies ≈åtsuki, and eventually he and ≈åtsuki drink together and develop a friendship. He begins appearing often after that, showing his trust for ≈åtsuki by accompanying him on gourmet meals and sightseeing trips and taking care of him. He also shows his compassionate side by going out of his way to visit ≈åtsuki when he catches a cold even on his day off, and by breaking down in tears when Numakawa almost breaks up with ≈åtsuki and Isawa. He is a huge fan of foreign films and knows a lot about manga. =Underground Labor Facility= ; : : The foreman of Squad C in the underground labor facility. He imitates ≈åtsuki and uses his foreman privilege to sell products in his squad as well. He is considered a rival by ≈åtsuki because his \\"Hoppy Set\\" consisting of Hoppy and curry rice crackers was a huge hit, and he also hosts a thriving underground movie business that utilizes tablets. On the other hand, because he uses his outings to download videos, he is not as accustomed to being on the outside world as ≈åtsuki (such as pronouncing \\"Wi-Fi\\" incorrectly and being hesitant to enter Miyuki, a small restaurant, because it seemed to have a lot of regulars). He has also been engaged in a spoiler battle for over a year with ≈åtsuki to sneak in and divulge the story and outcomes of famous new movies and manga. However, it is also apparent that he is not always at odds with ≈åtsuki, as when they try to watch One Cut of the Dead when they were both on an outing, they clacked their cups (paper cups from the movie theater, that is) in recognition of the difficulty they've both had with the spoilers spread out by the public to each other. In chapter 52, the screening of Rocky causes an underground muscle training boom. ≈åtsuki took advantage of the boom by selling protein, boiled eggs, salad chicken and other weight training meals at high prices. However, it eventually goes too far and the film business begins to suffer more harm than good, so Odagiri tried to calm the situation down in cooperation with ≈åtsuki, who was also affected, but it did not subside even after several months. ; : The foreman of Squad A in the underground labor facility. He is from Kumamoto Prefecture. Like ≈åtsuki, he is a manga fan, and was shocked when the magazine Sh≈çnen King stopped publishing. In chapter 42, he was found to be a two-time divorcee, and in chapter 61, it was revealed that he also had children. He wonders if the accumulation of habitual carelessness, such as his wife eating all of the pears that she has cut into 4-5 equal pieces without leaving any for the family, was the cause of the divorce. ; : The foreman of Squad B in the underground labor facility. He is from ≈åita Prefecture. Like ≈åtsuki, he is a manga fan, and like Itai, he was shocked when the magazine Sh≈çnen King stopped publishing. In chapter 43, it was revealed that he had turned his own sales of goods, which had been in the red, back to profit with Lumonde, which he had acquired at the Bourbon draft conference. ; :A young worker from underground. He is constantly expressionless, but has the same gourmet taste as ≈åtsuki. When he happened to be out on the same day as ≈åtsuki, he went to the same restaurants and ordered the same food as ≈åtsuki, and even impressed him with his peculiar toppings. Later on, he crossed paths with ≈åtsuki again underground, and ≈åtsuki couldn't help but ask for his name at the last minute. ; : Odagiri's close aide. He first appears in chapter 7. ; : A friend of Numakawa's from high school, who was sent into Squad E. Like Numakawa, he is from Miyazaki Prefecture, but unlike Numakawa, he often speaks in a Miyazaki dialect. His hobby is gambling, especially horse racing, which he is passionate about. Normally, he and Numakawa don't get along very well, but they played well together because of Yamamoto's presence. However, they drifted apart when Yamamoto changed schools and they all graduated from high school. Initially, he and Numakawa were uncomfortable because they hadn't seen each other for a long time, but because he was passionate about horse racing, he was able have a friendly talk about it with Numakawa and become friends with him even without Yamamoto. He goes outside for the first time in chapter 66. It is his first time in Tokyo and he is so excited that he speaks loudly in the train in a dialect, but Numakawa warns him about it. However, he encouraged Numakawa, who was depressed, and the two enjoyed sightseeing in Tokyo while speaking in the dialect together. ; : Numakawa and Kuroki's friend from high school. He was relatively versatile and had a personality that let him get along with anyone, and he was the reason Numakawa and Kuroki were playing so well together, but he had transferred to Tokyo to work in an entertainment production company. However, a week after Numakawa and Kuroki made friends with each other, he was sent underground and tried to chat with them about entertainment-related topics, but only made it more awkward for them. ; : A laborer who has been assigned to Squad E. Like ≈åtsuki, he is an incomparable manga lover, and instead of working, he fell into debts he got from Teiai and was sent underground (a genuine manga freak, according to the narrator). He had a great time talking about manga with ≈åtsuki, which also affected other foremen and Miyamoto, who had the same hobby. ; : A middle-aged laborer who appears in chapter 49. He tells everyone how he achieved an out- of-body experience and has been using it to go on outings without needing an outside pass for more than half a year. ≈åtsuki and the others didn't believe it, but when they tried to achieve it with the method they were taught out of curiosity, they actually succeeded. ; : One of the laborers who appears in chapter 57. He is from Saga Prefecture. He sits next to Numakawa at the \\"Kyushu People's Underground Gathering\\" and talks to Numakawa about the characteristics of Saga. ; : An aspiring comedian turned laborer who appears in chapter 50 of Mr. Tonegawa: Middle Management Blues and reappears in chapter 61 of this series. He was inadvertently mixed in with the candy- related talk by ≈åtsuki and his team that had started by chance on the day of the inspection of the underground work. However, ≈åtsuki didn't know him and was inwardly puzzled. He claims the best cake is financier because it is \\"deadly delicious.\\" ; : A popular actor. He played Buddy Red / Jin Nagatomo from the tokusatsu show \\"Friendship Squadron Buddy Rangers,\\" but his co-star on the show, Jun Shiraishi, who played Buddy Blue, forced him into debt and he fell into the underground as a laborer in Squad C. He held handshake sessions underground, played Buddy Red, and shared potato chips given to him by the workers, all in the spirit of service. But when Shiraishi repaid all his debts to Teiai, his release from the underground was confirmed in just a few days, and he said goodbye to the workers. =Related Teiai Group Persons= ; : An old man who is the chairman of the Teiai Group. When it is his or his henchmen's birthday, the prisoners of the underground labor facility are treated to a special menu, and if he is in a good mood he may also present them new equipment, only to immediately confiscate it when his mood is spoiled. ; : : One of the highest executives in the Teiai Group and protagonist of his own spin-off series Mr. Tonegawa: Middle Management Blues. He met ≈åtsuki in \\"Tonegawa vs. Hanch≈ç\\", a crossover collected in volume 5 of Tonegawa, and the two had to fight over a large bowl of katsudon. ; : One of the highest executives in the Teiai Group and a candidate for the No. 2 spot within the organization. He visits the underground labor facility and is shown around the area of Squad E by Miyamoto, but he notices and enjoys the fermented food made by Numakawa. As a result, he tries to take all of it away. Though he is stopped by Numakawa, his intimidating expression causes him to flinch, and he left underground with all the fermented food on hand. ; : One of the blacksuits. He is an unsocial, elderly man whose hobby is cooking. He has been making soba noodles for more than 30 years, so his skills are at the professional level. He also makes New Year's Eve soba that is served on December 31st, which even ≈åtsuki admits tastes good. He has been serving as the food service manager since chapter 50, purchasing many relatively inexpensive ingredients on a limited budget, maximizing the use of the parts of the ingredients he purchases and serving the workers a quality menu. To him, it was just a hobby and a way to save money, but as a result, he was revered as the \\"Meal Messiah\\" by the workers, who remembered the joy of eating, and during regular personnel shifts, there was an uproar among the workers as to whether he would stay or be transferred. However, the workers were dismayed when the head of food service was dismissed during the handover period in chapter 67, and furthermore, the personnel shifts were confirmed the following week. ; : One of the blacksuits. He is a two-child single father living in Sendagi. He was once Miyamoto's supervising employee and is respected by his junior colleague Miyamoto. He is a regular visitor to the National Museum of Nature and Science and has an exclusive years-lasting free pass, taking his two sons there many times. He kept an eye on ≈åtsuki and his friends as they stopped by the museum, but got irritated at their pretend- optimism as they were unaware of the scale of the renovated museum, and he showed them around the museum with enthusiasm and speed. ; : One of the blacksuits who used to be a pachislot employee. He became the new food service manager at the same time as Yanauchi's dismissal took place, but he is not a good cook. He is so determined that he eagerly tries to get Yanauchi to teach him how to cook. =Miscellaneous= ; : : The proprietress of a small restaurant named Miyuki. She has a methodical personality and cooks carefully and thoroughly (according to ≈åtsuki, it is not the average cooking that \\"a plebeian runt\\" could achieve) and likes Western movies more than Japanese ones. When ≈åtsuki first visited, he liked the food and the low price, and became a regular visitor to the restaurant, to the point that a bottle of shochu is kept there specifically for him. At the cherry blossom viewing camp, she was greeted by Miyamoto as special guest and served him sushi wrapped in fried tofu. ; : A former laborer from the underground labor facility. He is from Saga Prefecture. He has a caring and gentle nature and is well-liked by ≈åtsuki and others. During the economic bubble burst, he got sent underground when he was over thirty years old and continued to spend his days there for nearly a quarter of a century until his sentence finally expired. However in the meantime, he hadn't been outside once and got his information exclusively from old newspapers and magazines, so his knowledge of the outside world, such as slang and incidents, was all outdated. He asked ≈åtsuki to escort him for one day after his sentence expired due to his anxiety about going above ground (Kimura paid for ≈åtsuki's pass), and although he was teased for his naivete by ≈åtsuki and believing ≈åtsuki's lies, he showed that he was willing to take a stand to protect ≈åtsuki from being beaten up by a group of hoodlums. After that, he began working as a traffic manager and lives in an apartment along the Seibu Line, where ≈åtsuki and his friends sometimes visit and stay. He falls in love with the middle-aged female employee of a large bakery. ; :He visited the cherry blossom viewing camp with his father and brother. Numakawa taught him the rules of mahjong and they gave each other a thumbs-up when they said goodbye. ; : Makita's second son. He visited the cherry blossom viewing camp with his father and brother and bragged to the diner lady about the games he had brought with him, but he then gets tired of playing and falls sound asleep. ; : A hairdresser who previously wanted to be a novelist. He is 36 years old. He runs into ≈åtsuki, who asked for an intestine stew. He tries to recommend ≈åtsuki a Kendo Kobayashi-like hairstyle, which causes ≈åtsuki's hair to look like Kobayashi's at the end of his outing. He chooses immortality immediately, given Nozaki's choices between immortality or dying now, but Nozaki points out that he doesn't understand true immortality. Later, he writes the first two lines of his novel, but falls asleep. ; :An art college student. He is 20 years old. He entered the drinking party after being amused by the talk between ≈åtsuki and Obara. He draws a manga and tries to submit it for an award, but it is too overstuffed for a one-shot. However, he is praised by ≈åtsuki. He forces the three of them to choose between immortality and dying now, but when Obara immediately chooses immortality, he points out that he doesn't understand true immortality. He is surprisingly a strong drinker. Later, he adds an immortality trait to the main character of the manga he drew, but the editor-in-chief points out that there is too much crammed into the manga. ; :A 42 year old mountaineer who entered the conversation when Obara wondered if ≈åtsuki enjoyed his current job. He has been an aspiring alpinist since he was 30 years old and is trying to climb Mt. Everest. He is good at Japanese. ; :A boy's female pet dog who gets named by ≈åtsuki. She encounters ≈åtsuki, who is released on an outing, in Tokyo Park after she gets separated from her owner for an unknown reason. ≈åtsuki tames her, but she is surprisingly gluttonous and doesn't know any commands besides \\"wait\\". Eventually she is reunited with her owner and his father just before ≈åtsuki's time runs out. She tries to follow him as he is taken back underground, but stops and sees him off when he gives her the \\"wait\\" command. Her real name is .

The region long experienced shallow marine conditions during the tectonic evolutions of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, as coastal plain sediments accumulated up to 45,000 feet thick, including limestone, dolomite, marl, anhydrite and sandstone layers, with some oil and gas occurrences and the remnants of Cretaceous volcanic activity in some locations. Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics The Black Warrior Basin was the southern margin of the proto-North American continent Laurentia. Precambrian rocks have only been found in a few boreholes in the north of the state, including microperthite granite and a syenite sample dated to 785 million years ago in the Proterozoic. The oldest documented basement granites are 790 million years old and researches Thomas and Osborne, in 1987 found gneiss up to 1.12 billion years old. =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= During the Ordovician, the 650 foot thick Knox Dolomite, Stones River Group and Nashville Group sediments formed in the shallow marine platform environment of the Black Warrior Basin. Shale, limestone and undifferentiated sediments comprise the Wayne Group and Brownsport Formation from the Silurian, overlain by Devonian chert and the Chattanooga shale. Some Devonian rocks contain trilobite fossils. A number of different formations took shape during the Carboniferous, including the Floyd Shale, intermixed with several different sandstone layers and overlain by the Pottsville Formation. Shallow seas dropped between the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian around 330 million years ago. During the formation of the supercontinent Pangea, sediments in the Black Warrior Basin were uplifted and faulted as the region experienced dry, continental conditions. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= The Mississippi Interior Salt Basin underlies southern and west-central Mississippi with up to 3000 feet of Late Jurassic salt and 50 shallow salt domes. It formed during the beginnings of the Gulf of Mexico during the breakup of Pangea. Triassic igneous sills injected into shales in the Black Warrior Basin during the rifting process. Salt deposition ended by 150 million years ago. Mantle upwelling thinned the crust in the Jurassic. In Mississippi, the Smackover Limestone covered over earlier evaporite deposits. A complex stratigraphic sequence formed during the Cretaceous, with the reef limestones, anhydrite and sandstones of the Rodessa Formation, Mooringsport Formation, Paluxy Formation, Gordo Formation and Coker Formation, overlain by the Eutaw Group, Austin Chalk, Selma Chalk and numerous thin marl, chalk and sandstone layers. The Richton Salt Dome was briefly famous in the early 1980s as a proposed site for US nuclear waste disposal. A volcano built the Jackson Dome, uplifting the Eutaw Formation on a 184 square mile island. Magma and thermal gas created halos in the Smackover Limestone, Norphlet Sandstone and Cotton Valley Group rich in hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide and over-pressurized gas is a risk in the poor quality gas fields on the southeastern side of Jackson Dome. The Midnight Volcano in southern Humphreys County is another buried volcanic feature from 75 million years ago in the Cretaceous. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)= During the Cenozoic, the Mississippi Embayment was filled by large river and delta systems, depositing sediments reaching up to 45,000 feet thick beneath the Gulf Coastal Plain and 35,000 feet in the Terrebonne Trench, west of the Mississippi River. In the Paleocene, the Midway Group limestone, marl and sand lenses formed, followed by the Wilcox Group into the Eocene. Shale, sandstone and limestone typified the Eocene Claiborne Group and Jackson Group, with a greater presence of limestone in the Oligocene Vicksburg Group. Thicker units such as the Catahoula and Hattiesburg Formations formed in the Miocene, followed by the Pascagoula Formation, Graham Ferry Formation and Citronelle Formation into the Pliocene. Alluvium, sand, gravel, barrier islands and loess define most of the Quaternary deposition from the past 2.5 million years. Soils Soils in Mississippi result from the weathering of bedrock, fine grained alluvial fill and loess (windblown glacial rock flour from the Mississippi River Alluvial Plain). The high fertility soils of the Loess Belt attracted many people to pursue plantation agriculture in the 1800s. Hardwood trees dominate in loess deposits north of Vicksburg, particularly sweet gum, basswood, water oak, cherrybark, poplar and bitternut. A few small prairies developed atop Cretaceous and Eocene chalk. Hydrogeology The state has up to 125,000 water wells, with the most significant pumping from the Mississippi River alluvial aquifer for agriculture. Analysis of 1369 water wells from 1989 to 2007 found only three wells with unsafe levels of pesticides and agricultural chemicals. The Miocene, Wilcox, Sparta, Lower Cretaceous and Tuscaloosa are the next most important aquifers after the Mississippi River aquifer. Historically, the thick Yazoo Clay made groundwater difficult to extract on the Jackson Prairie. Natural resource geology The discovery of the Amory Gas Field in Monroe County in 1926 and Jackson Gas Field in 1929 propelled the state to become an oil and gas producer. Oil was first produced from the Tinsley Field from the Late Cretaceous and the state had already produced over one billion barrels by 1970. A few wells were drilled as much as 20,000 feet deep. Aside from amateur collecting Mississippi does not have mineable mineral resources.

The classification included subcategories, Number 1 through 8, as well as the many individual systems which were assigned Marks. Some of the Army radars pre-date the introduction of this classification system, and had their own nomenclature that tended to remain in use even after they officially received new names. Notable among these are the Gun Laying and Searchlight control categories. Additionally, equipment introduced after the classification system often have rainbow codes that they are well known by. Some were also used by the Royal Air Force and thus also had an AMES number. Number 1 AA Number 1 was assigned to the early gun laying radars operating in the 1.5 m VHF band. They were almost always referred to by their original name, GL Mk. I radar. The microwave-frequency systems that replaced them were assigned Number 3. There were three entries in the Number 1 classification: * AA No. 1 Mark 1 - GL Mk. I * AA No. 1 Mark 1* - GL Mk. I*, a slightly upgraded version of the original * AA No. 1 Mark 2 - GL Mk. II Number 2 AA Number 2 was assigned to the existing Searchlight Control radars. There were nine entries, Mark 1 through Mark 9, which were identical to the original Marks of the original SLC category. The SLC concept was already falling from use when the new naming system was introduced, and were generally not referred to by their new names. Number 3 AA Number 3 collected a wide variety of microwave-frequency gun laying radars, mostly following the Marks of the earlier Gun Laying category. This was one of the few categories that was used extensively in the post-war era, and thus one of the few that contains entries without a former GL name. There were eight entries: * AA No. 3 Mark 1 - GL Mk. III(C), the Canadian- designed version of Mk. III. * AA No. 3 Mark 2 - GL Mk. III(B), the UK- designed version of Mk. III. Sub-versions /1 through /5. * AA No. 3 Mark 3 - Expedient portable AA radar based on the SLC electronics. Also known as \\"Baby Maggie\\". * AA No. 3 Mark 4 - Early versions of what would become AA No. 3 Mk. 7. * AA No. 3 Mark 5 - UK name for US-built SCR-584 used from 1944 onwards. * AA No. 3 Mark 6 - Post-war Canadian lock-follow design, not taken into service. * AA No. 3 Mark 7 - Post-war version of AA No. 3 Mk. 4, standard AA radar into the 1960s. * AA No. 3 Mark 8 - UK name for US-built SCR-584, not taken into service. Number 4 AA Number 4 was a wide collection of short and medium-range systems known as tactical control radars, whose main purpose was to provide cueing support to the AA Number 3 radars, or \\"putting on\\". There were seven entries: * AA No. 4 Mark 1 - Canadian design rapidly developed from Air-Sea Vessel radar electronics. Widely used with GL Mk. III systems and later. Known in Canada as the Zone Position Indicator, or ZPI. * AA No. 4 Mark 2 - UK-built versions of the Mark 1. * AA No. 4 Mark 3 - Similar to Mark 1 and 2, but operating on Airborne Interception radar frequencies. Two sub-versions, (V) which was Vehicle mounted (on a truck) and (P) which was Portable. * AA No. 4 Mark 4 - UHF set working at 600 MHz, not taken into service. * AA No. 4 Mark 5 - Expedient development working in the S band, only small numbers used. Also known as \\"Gorgonzola\\" due to the shape of its antenna. * AA No. 4 Mark 6 - Canadian S band development, highly portable. Known in Canada as the Microwave Zone Position Indicator, or MZPI. * AA No. 4 Mark 7 - UK-built versions of the Mark 6. Some sources say this was the early name for the Orange Yeoman radar, but it is more likely that would have been part of Number 5. Number 5 AA Number 5 was assigned to radars similar to Number 4 in concept, but with longer range. These were to be assigned to the Anti-Aircraft Operations Rooms (AAORs) to provide early warning and tactical control over a metropolitan-sized area. There were two entries: * AA No. 5 Mark 1 - 209 MHz (VHF) * AA No. 5 Mark 2 - 600 MHz (UHF) Number 6 AA Number 6 was a special-purpose system dedicated to rangefinding for light anti-aircraft guns, namely the Bofors gun. Short-range AA is a very difficult task to automate because the aircraft appear only for moments, have high crossing speeds, and are often close to the ground so clutter is a significant issue. Number 6 was designed to make a rapid line-of-sight range measurement while pointing the gun was handled manually as before. There were three entries, Mark 1 through 3, differing primarily in detail. Number 7 AA Number 7 was part of a combined Fire Control System (FCS) for the Bofors guns. It included a rapidly scanning tactical control radar and a separate gun laying radar in a second cabin. The operator of the scanner would select targets, causing the gun laying cabin to slew onto the right bearing. The operator would then find the target, and begin a lock-follow. From then the data from the radar was sent into a predictor in the same cabin as the gun laying radar, which in turn controlled motorized systems on the guns. There were three entries, differing in detail.

A much smaller customised version had been tested on monkeys in 2008. The scientific advisory committee agreed to test the implant on 30 patients. The plastic discs were approved for sale by the British Standards Institution (BSI) after the completion of these tests. An internal Ranier Technology report indicates that the results of the tests were analysed by the scientific advisory board. Ranier Technology was also granted CE (Conformit√© Europ√©enne) safety marks for the Cadisc-L implant, as well as for another implant, Cadisc-C. After the BSI and CE approval, Aebi implanted the prosthesis with 7 patients in his own practice. In March 2014, after various reports of disintegrating disks, Ranier Technology withdrew the defective prosthesis from the market. In an interview on 29 November 2018, Max Aebi believed that none of his 7 patients were affected, as none of them had come forward at such time. At a later date, one of the patients alleged to have had problems with the implant. However, none of the other 7 patients had any persistent symptoms. In Germany, a case against another doctor was filed late last year alleging assault against 53 patients who had the device implanted. = Humanitarian involvement = Aebi spends time in humanitarian work in areas such as Pakistan and Armenia.

Biography Pavle Simiƒá was born into a family of merchants. Having lost his parents very early, he was taken in by his grandfather who was a priest in Kanji≈æa. During one Sunday service, he became overwhelmed with admiration for the iconostasis painted by Teodor Iliƒá ƒåe≈°ljar that he decided from that moment on to become an artist. He completed his secondary education in Sombor and Subotica, then he enrolled in a private art school in Novi Sad and joined the Atelier of Aloiza Castagni, an Italian painter, originally from Mantua. In December 1837 he moved to Vienna and attended the Academy of Fine Arts. There he studied the history of painting until 1841. Lithography Acutely aware of the ubiquitous role of graphic prints, Simiƒá made many preparatory drawings for graphic works. His \\"Serbs Gathered round a Guslar Singer\\" was turned into a lithograph in 1839 by Johann Baptist Clarot. Simiƒá also prepared three drawings for Anastas Jovanoviƒá's lithographs. These were the portraits \\"Vuk Karad≈æiƒá\\", \\"Pavle Karanotvrtkoviƒá\\" (both in 1841) and \\"Georgije Servijski\\" (1846).

None of them have any memory of who they are or how they got there, and each takes on the name that is printed on their clothes tags. The group make initial attempts to band together, but differing priorities and strong personalities cause some of them to clash. In particular, Chase, who wants to investigate the island, doesn't get along with KC, who is suspicious of Chase's ability to find resources, and Brody, who attempts to rape Chase. When Brody is murdered, the group assume Chase is responsible and knock her unconscious. Chase wakes up in a prison facility, where she learns that she and the other nine people are violent crime prisoners, and are part of a \\"rehabilitation simulation\\". Their minds have been put in the computer simulation of the island to test if they'll resume old behavioral patterns. Anyone who dies in the simulation dies in real life. Chase is returned to the island simulation, where the avatars of two prison marshals arrive to deliberately cause the group to fight and split up. Additionally, the prisoners' memories start to return, which causes further friction and confusion.

Reception The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 8% approval rating for the first season with an average rating of 3/10, based on 12 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Bafflingly bad, the only mystery is how The I-Land got made in the first place.\\" TV Guide gives the miniseries a rating of 0.5/5, and their critic Tim Surette summarized that it \\"is an astonishingly dumb seven-episode mystery-box limited series about 10 people who wake up on a deserted tropical island with no memory of who they are or how they got there. But that central conceit is quickly resolved by Episode 3, as The I-Land spins out of control, rolls over, and wraps itself around an entirely new and equally stupid story.\\" Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Daniel Fienberg compared the miniseries to the series Lost \\"only with a fundamental misunderstanding of how Lost handled character development, mythology, flashback structure, theme and ensemble-building.\\" He also wrote that \\"no aspect of The I-Land works, and every bad aspect builds on the bad aspects before in a way that makes it pretty clear that nobody involved could have been under any misapprehensions about the quality of the endeavor.\\" At Paste, Allison Keene said \\"I have watched some truly, truly bad series in my day, but few that went off the rails this hard this fast. But man, what a ride. Cannibals, climate change, rogue simulations, for-profit prisons, a game with no rules and no logic ‚Ä¶ what an embarrassment of riches. Or just an embarrassment. We‚Äôll go with that last one.\\" In his \\"Stream It Or Skip It\\" review, Joel Keller at Decider stated that the miniseries should be skipped and summarizes that \\"The I-Land‚Äòs clunky dialogue and generic characters make us care very little about why these ten jerks are on this island. And, yes, they‚Äôre all pretty much jerks.\\" Jack Seale at The Guardian gave the miniseries one out of five stars and summarizes that \\"This is sci-fi without a vision, a genre piece that doesn‚Äôt know how its own genre works. The I-Land is begging to be forgotten.\\" Writing for RogerEbert.com, Brian Tallerico summarized that \\"The ‚ÄòI‚Äô stands for Idiotic. If you put a group of teenagers in a room and showed them a few episodes of LOST and Westworld before asking them to write their own program, they might come up with The I-Land,\\" and that \\"It is a bafflingly horrible sci-fi show, the kind of project that leaves your jaw on the floor, not unlike the first time you saw Tommy Wiseau‚Äôs The Room.\\" References External links  Category:2010s American science fiction television series Category:2019 American television series debuts Category:2019 American television series endings Category:American adventure television series Category:American thriller television series Category:English-language television shows Category:English- language Netflix original programming Category:American science fiction web series Category:Thriller television series Category:Television series set on fictional islands Category:Television shows set on islands Category:Thriller web series ","title":"The I-Land"},{"id":"58601054","text":"Sir Francis Leicester, 3rd Baronet (1674‚Äì1742) of Tabley, Cheshire was a British landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1715 to 1727.

The inheritance fell to Merriel‚Äôs eldest son by her second marriage who duly changed his name from Byrne to Leicester. As he could not demolish the old hall, he built a completely new house about 700 metres away, which is the present Tabley House and the family moved into it in 1767.

Greenhouse gas emissions by Turkey account for about one percent of the world's total and include carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrofluorocarbons. Turkey's human contributions to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions include the Turkey's power-generation and transport sectors. The natural and agricultural landscape of Turkey also affects national greenhouse gas emissions, with methane and N2O from agriculture more than offset by carbon dioxide taken up by forests (slightly reducing Turkey's overall emissions). The main determinant of emissions is the government through national energy policy, construction, transport and agriculture. Coal, cars, cows, and construction accounted for about half of Turkey's 2018 gross greenhouse gas emissions of 520 million tons (Mt) of CO2eq. About 100 Mt was reabsorbed by land use, land-use change, and forestry, mostly by forests. Turkey emits about one percent of the world's total greenhouse gases, averaging over six tonnes per person (about the global per-person average). The burning of fossil fuels for electricity, heat and transport made up over 70 percent of the country's 2018 greenhouse gases; industry and agriculture were over 10 percent each, and forests (including reforestation) absorbed about 20 percent. Coal (used to generate electricity, for heating and by industry) accounts for the largest part of Turkey's fossil-fuel emissions, followed by petroleum products (used for transport) and natural gas (used for heating and electricity generation). Although climate change in Turkey is forecast to impact severely, the country's plans to limit emissions have been called \\"critically insufficient\\" by the independent research organization Climate Action Tracker. Turkey has signed, but not ratified, global agreements on reducing greenhouse gas emissions; the country has not yet ratified the Kigali Accord to regulate hydrofluorocarbons, and is one of the few countries that have not ratified the Paris agreement on climate change. A major reason for Turkey's high rate of emissions is that coal-fired power stations in Turkey are subsidized. Emissions increased quickly during the late 20th and early 21st centuries, although Turkey increased investment in energy efficiency and its renewable resources during the 2010s and 2020s. The country will probably meet the \\"unambitious\\" Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) it has submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 2030 target Gross greenhouse gas emissions by Turkey by year and target According to the Eleventh Development Plan (2019‚Äì2023), \\"Within the framework of Intended National Contribution, activities for emission control will be carried out in greenhouse gas emitting buildings, energy, industry, transportation, waste, agriculture and forestry sectors.\\" In 2015, Turkey submitted its emissions target to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), \\"up to 21 percent reduction in [greenhouse gas (GHG)] emissions from the Business as Usual level by 2030\\" and aiming to emit 929 Mt of CO2 (before subtracting CO2 absorbed by forests) in 2030. However, such an increase during the 2021‚Äì2030 implementation period (see graph) would emit over 10 tonnes per person in 2030. The national strategy and action plan only partially covers short-term mitigation, and the OECD has recommended that climate change mitigation efforts be increased. = Comparison with EU target = Unless Turkey's energy policy is changed, European Union emissions per person are forecast to fall below Turkey's during the 2020s. Since the EU is Turkey's main trading partner, a comparison with targets in the European Green Deal is important to help avoid future carbon tariffs on Turkish exports such as steel and cement. Turkey joining the European Union Emission Trading Scheme would reportedly be more economically- beneficial for the power sector than a carbon tariff. Greenhouse gas sources 2018 greenhouse gas emissions and absorption in Turkey upright=1.4 With a population of 83 million, Turkey's annual per-person emissions are about the world average (over six tonnes) and need to be reduced to meet the global carbon budget. The government's Turkish Statistical Institute (Turkstat) follows Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines and uses production-based greenhouse gas emissions accounting to compile the country's emission inventory, which is submitted to the UNFCCC each April (about 15 months after the end of the reported year). Consumption-based emissions are estimated by the Global Carbon Project to have been 470 Mt of CO2eq in 2017. =Burning fossil fuels for heat and power= Carbon dioxide emitted by fossil fuels According to the Turkish Energy Ministry, \\"Our country aims to use our energy resources efficiently, effectively and in a way that has a minimum impact on the environment within the scope of the sustainable development objectives\\". Combustion of coal in Turkey contributed most to 2018 fossil-fuel emissions, followed by oil and natural gas. That year, Turkey's energy sector emitted almost three-fourths of the country's greenhouse gases; industrial processes and product use (IPPU) and agriculture each emitted one- eighth. The largest emitters are electricity generation, followed by transport. Carbon capture and storage is extremely rare in Turkey; it is not economically viable, since the country has no carbon emission trading. Power stations Power stations in Turkey emitted 149 Mt CO2eq in 2018, generating public heat and electricity (mainly burning coal). Almost all coal burnt in power stations is local lignite or imported hard coal. Coal analysis of Turkish lignite compared to other lignites indicates that it is high in ash and moisture, low in energy value and high in emission intensity; Turkish lignite emits more CO2 than other countries' lignites per unit of energy when burnt. Although imported hard coal has a lower emission intensity when burnt, the life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions account for transportation and are similar. With its nuclear power station not yet completed and despite the potential for expanded renewable energy in Turkeywhich, except for geothermal, emits little CO2eqthe country averages a grid emission intensity of over 460 gCO2eq/kWh (over 125 t/TJ, similar to that of natural gas). A trial of reinjecting gas back into the ground is planned for 2021. Grid intensity per person is higher than the global average, which was 450 gCO2eq/kWh in 2017. =Coal-fired stations= Coal-fired power stations emitted 111 Mt CO2eq in 2018. If operated at the targeted capacity factor, planned units at Af≈üin Elbistan would add over 60 million tonnes of per year. By comparison, total annual emissions are about 520 million tonnes; more than one-tenth of the country's greenhouse gas emissions would be from the planned power station. Coal in Turkey is the largest source of greenhouse gases. Over a million tonnes of CO2 is emitted for every TWh of electricity generated in Turkey by coal-fired power stations. When emissions from industry and building heating and methane emissions from coal mining are added to coal-fired electricity generation, about one-third of Turkey's annual emissions come from coal. In 2018, coal emitted over 150 Mt CO2eq. Annual methane emissions from underground coal mining are estimated at two Mt CO2eq, and three Mt from open- pit mining. Eren Holding (via Eren Enerji's coal-fired ZETES power stations) emits over two percent of Turkey's greenhouse gases, and ƒ∞√áDA≈û emits over one percent via its Bekirli coal-fired power stations. =Gas-fired stations= Gas-fired power stations emitted 37 Mt CO2eq in 2018, but it was difficult for them to compete with coal due to the lack of a carbon tax. The spark spread for 55-percent efficient gas-fired plants was around $7/MWh in mid-2020. , some power utilities (including eight gas-fired plants) were struggling to repay their foreign currency debts because of depreciation of the lira and long-term BOTA≈û gas-purchase contracts. Offtake guarantees (a subsidy received by some gas-fired plants) end in 2020. Transport fuel A traffic jam in Istanbul, one of the few major European cities without a low- emission zone Transport emitted 85 Mt of CO2eq in 2018, about one tonne per person and 16 percent of the nation's total. Road transport in the country dominated emissions with 79 Mt, including agricultural vehicles. More than three-quarters of Turkey's road-transport emissions come from diesel fuel. Average emissions of new cars in 2016 were about 120 gCO2/km; although the EU has a 2021 target of 95 gCO2/km, Turkey has no target. , Turkey had no measures to reduce the well-to-wheel impact of petrol and diesel vehicles. Fuel quality and emissions standards for new cars were less strict in 2020 than those in the EU; about 45 percent of cars are over 10 years old and energy-inefficient. Domestic flights emitted 4 Mt of CO2eq in 2018, and Istanbul Airport opened the following year. Turkish Airlines did not respond to the 2018 Carbon Disclosure Project questionnaire, and in 2019 the airline was named as one of those with the weakest plans to reduce emissions. Fuel for heating and cooking Pollution over Ankara. Coal is still burnt to heat older buildings in cities. Residential fuel, such as natural gas, coal and wood, contributed 39 Mt CO2eq in 2018. Subsidies for poor families to use coal for heating produce black carbon (a contributor to climate change) and other local air pollution. Burning fuel such as coal and natural gas to heat commercial and institutional buildings emitted 14 Mt CO2eq in 2018. =Industry= In 2018, Turkey's industrial sector emitted one-eighth of the country's greenhouse gases. , estimates of the effects of government policy on industrial emissions are lacking. The European steel industry has complained that imports from Turkey are unfair competition because they are not subject to a carbon tax, and alleges that the natural gas used to produce them is subsidized. Turkish steel, primarily from minimills, averages about one tonne of CO2 per tonne produced (less than China and Ukraine in 2020). Some businesspeople are concerned that a future European Green Deal might include a carbon tariff on products such as Turkish steel, but this could also provide opportunities such as competitiveness against products such as Ukrainian steel. Cement Turkey is the fourth-largest cement producer in the world, and the country's 2017 cement production emitted seven percent of its total GHG. Although Turkey's construction sector contracted at the end of 2018 (using less cement), 72.5 million tons of cement were produced in 2019; of that, 64.5 million tons were sold in the country. =Agriculture and waste= Reducing beef and dairy consumption would also reduce imports. Agriculture accounted for one-eighth of Turkey's 2018 greenhouse gas emissions, primarily due to enteric fermentation, agricultural soils, and fertilizer management. In the agricultural sector, cattle emit the most GHG. The amount of nitrous oxide emitted by agricultural soils is uncertain. Turks eat an average of of red meat per person each year, and the country produced one million tonnes of beef in 2019. There are about 18 million cattle in the country; over 600,000 live cattle were imported in 2019, and cattle and fuel for agriculture are subsidized. Sheep and goats, which are also subsidized, emit less GHG than cattle. , estimates of the effects of government policy on the agricultural and waste sectors' emissions are lacking. Although sugar beets are not significant emitters, some sugar factories (such as some owned by T√ºrk≈üeker and Konya Seker) burn coal for the heat needed by the process of making sugar and sometimes also to generate electricity. The waste sector contributed 3.4 percent of Turkey's 2018 greenhouse gas emissions, and landfilling is the most common waste-disposal method. Organic waste sent to landfills emits methane, and the country is working to improve sustainable waste and resource management; some favor composting, and others argue for incineration.  Reducing greenhouse gas emissions  Turkey's Energy Efficiency Action Act, which came into force in 2018, commits nearly US$11 billion to efficiency and could significantly limit emissions. , however, energy efficiency policies had yet to be translated into measurable targets and measures. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is investing in energy efficiency. = Energy = Emissions could be considerably reduced by switching from coal to existing gas-fired power stations, because there is enough generating capacity to shut down all coal-fired power stations and still meet peak energy demand. High interest rates were an obstacle to the construction of solar- power plants in 2019, but a domestic solar panel factory began production in 2020. After upgrading, repowering and adding a small amount of pumped-storage hydroelectricity, there are enough hydropower dams in Turkey to provide dispatchable generation to balance variable renewable energy, even if future rainfall lessens due to climate change. Wind and solar power could expand to avoid carbon lock-in if Turkey's energy policy changed to remove its US$1.6 billion annual fossil-fuel subsidies. Experimentation with hydrogen distribution is planned for 2021; moving towards a hydrogen economy (for heating, for example) could reduce dependence on imported natural gas. In rural areas without a piped gas supply, heat pumps may be an alternative. Geothermal-electric capacity totalled 1.6 gigawatts in 2020 (with potential for expansion), but it is unclear how much Turkish geothermal power is low- carbon. National and international investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency are being made; for example, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is supporting the installation of smart meters. = Buildings = Turkey was a co-leader of the group discussing zero-carbon buildings at the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit, and the city of Eski≈üehir pledged to convert all existing buildings to zero emissions by 2050. However, Turkish building codes do not take into account climatic differences across the country. The 2005 Environment Act, Energy Efficiency Regulation, and green building certificates are often not properly implemented. Academics at Sabancƒ± University have suggested adopting the EU standard to increase the proportion of passive houses (2018/844/EU, amending the directive on the energy performance of buildings). Building codes will be changed to mandate charging points in new shopping malls and parking lots. Geothermal heating installed capacity totals 3.5 GW thermal (GWt) in 2020 (with the potential for 60 GWt), but it is unclear how much is low-carbon. The largest reduction in emissions from cement production could be made by reducing its clinker content from the current 87 percentfor example, by making LC3 cement (which is only half clinker). The second-largest reduction could be made by switching half the fuel from hard coal and petcoke to a mixture of rubber from waste tires, refuse-derived fuel and biomass. Although the country has enough of these materials, most kilns use coal, petroleum coke or lignite as their primary energy source. More cross-laminated timber could be used for building, instead of concrete. Further decarbonization of cement production would depend heavily on carbon capture and storage (CCS). Despite Turkey's earthquake risk, CCS may be technically feasible in a salt dome near Lake Tuz or in Diyarbakƒ±r Province. CCS is not financially viable, however, because Turkey has no carbon pricing. = Transport = Although Turkey has several manufacturers of electric buses and many are exported, fewer than 100 were in use in the country in 2018; according to a 2020 forecast, they may not saturate the local bus market until the 2040s. Ebikes are manufactured, but cities could be improved to make local bicycle trips safer. Although Turkey's ferries (unlike other countries') are still fossil-fuelled, the world's first all-electric tugboat began work in Istanbul's harbor in 2020, electric lorries are manufactured, and an electric excavator is planned for 2022.  Cars  Hybrid cars are manufactured locally, and Turkey's automotive industry plans to make an electric car in 2022 which will receive tax discounts and incentives. Creation of a domestic electric vehicle market by TOGG is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and costs (charging being less expensive than fuelling), create jobs, and reduce oil imports. The introduction of smart charging is important. The legality of ridesharing companies is unclear, and taxis could be better integrated with public transport. In 2019, Turkey had about 1,300 electric cars and two public charging stations per car. In the first half of 2020, about 200 electric cars and about 8,000 hybrids were sold out of the country's total of 341,000 cars. , there were no low-emission zones in any Turkish cities, although enabling regulations had been introduced the previous year. Although the special consumption tax(Turkish) ‚Äî a sales tax on luxuries, such as private cars ‚Äî and the annual motor-vehicle tax is lower for electric cars than for fossil-fuel cars, suppliers of car batteries must pay a recycling fee. In 2019, 0.1% of cars sold in Turkey were hybrid or electric. Partially due to high import tariffs, few foreign electric cars are sold. Carbon sinks The reforestation of Doƒüanbey, Seferihisar. Forests, however, can only reabsorb a small part of fossil fuel emissions Carbon sinks, which consist mainly of forests in Turkey, offset almost 20 percent of the country's emissions in 2018. Reforestation and changes in land use may alter this, however, and warmer and drier air in the south and west may make it difficult to sustain the present forest cover. NGOs such as TEMA are encouraging reforestation, and the government said in 2015 that by 2050 \\"forests are envisioned to stretch across over four-fifths of the country's territory\\". According to Ege University associate professor Serdar G√∂khan Senol, however, the government may be too focused on economics and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry replants when it should wait for regrowth instead. Three-quarters of the land is deficient in soil organic matter. Turkey was developing a national soil-carbon database in 2019; this is important because carbon emissions from soil are directly related to climate change, but vary according to soil interaction. Economics During the late 20th and early 21st centuries, growth of the Turkish economy and population was linked to increased emissions from electricity generation, industry and construction. In 2018, the government forecast that GHG emissions were expected to increase in parallel with GDP growth over the next decade. When economic growth resumes after Turkey's late 2010s and Covid-19 recessions, it will be possible to expand the country's renewable-energy potential and invest in energy efficiency with a sustainable energy policy (decoupling economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions. There were no explicit green measures in the 2020 package designed to recover from the country's Covid-19 recession; the VAT rate for domestic aviation was cut, and oil and gas were discounted. = Potential cost-benefits of carbon pricing and ratifying the Paris Agreement = Turkey's carbon emissions are costly, even without carbon tariffs from other countries. The long-term impact of climate change on any economy is highly uncertain and very difficult to estimate. The short-term benefits of climate-change mitigation have been estimated at over US$50 per tonne of CO2 abated for health alone for middle-income countries generally, and $764 million for Turkey. Academics have estimated that if Turkey and other countries invested in accordance with the Paris Agreement, Turkey would break even around 2060. Boƒüazi√ßi University have developed a decision-support tool and integrated assessment model for Turkey's energy and environmental policy. A study estimated that by creating a national emissions-trading market at a $50-per-tonne carbon price, Turkey's INDC commitment could be met at a cost of 0.8 percent of GDP by 2030. The study did not estimate how much the benefits would offset the cost, or the cost of not having a market. In 2020, a voluntary market existed. A revenue-neutral carbon tax might be best for the Turkish economy; without a carbon tax or emissions trading, the country could be vulnerable to carbon tariffs imposed by the EU, the UK or other export partners. Turkey received the most EU climate-change financing by far in 2018; the EBRD is investing in, and have offered to support, an equitable transition from coal. In 2015, less than half of Turkey's carbon emissions from energy use were priced. Taxes meet the social cost of road-transport carbon (not, however, the social cost of the country's air pollution), but all other sectors have a large gap between the actual tax ( per tonne of CO2 in 2018) and the tax with this negative externality; the actual cost of most greenhouse gas emissions is not borne by the emitters, violating the polluter pays principle. Although economists have studied the cost benefits for the US of ratifying the Paris Agreement (concluding that it would be beneficial), no similar study has been done of the agreement's effect on the Turkish economy. Politics Article 56 of the Turkish Constitution states, \\"Everyone has the right to live in a healthy and balanced environment. It is the duty of the State and citizens to improve the natural environment, to protect the environmental health and to prevent environmental pollution.\\" According to the Eleventh Development Plan (2019‚Äì2023): > It is seen that climate change accelerating due to high greenhouse gas > emissions causes natural disasters and poses a serious threat to humanity.\\" > and \\"International climate change negotiations will be conducted within the > framework of the Intended National Contribution with the principles of > common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and > within the scope of national conditions, climate change will be tackled in > sectors causing greenhouse gas emissions and the resilience of the economy > and society to climate risks will be increased by capacity building for > adaptation to climate change.\\" The Climate Change and Air Management Coordination Board is responsible for coordinating government departments, and includes three business organizations. Policy for a just transition from carbon-intensive assets, such as coal, is lacking. Ratification of the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol, reducing hydrofluorocarbon emissions, was under consideration by Parliament in 2019 and awaiting presidential approval. it had not been ratified, but there are some restrictions and revision of the 2018 regulation is being considered. According to √úmit ≈ûahin, who teaches climate change at Sabancƒ± University, Turkey sees industrialized Western countries as solely responsible. Limiting their actions on climate change, Turkey and other countries have cited US president Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. For the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit on achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, Turkey co-led the coalition on the decarbonization of land transport. It has been suggested that limiting emissions through directives to the state-owned gas and electricity companies would be less effective than a carbon price (or tax), but would be more politically acceptable. According to former economy minister Kemal Dervi≈ü, many people will benefit from the green transition but the losses will be concentrated on specific groups, making them more visible and politically disruptive. Turkish citizens taking individual and political action on climate change on the streets and online include children demanding action and petitioning the UN. Energy Minister Fatih D√∂nmez favors coal, but Environment Minister Murat Kurum is planning for adaptation and said in 2020 that global cooperation is key to tackling climate change. Proposed and under-construction coal power is primarily financed by governments. The China-funded Emba Hunutlu power station is being built; the Turkey Wealth Fund-proposed Af≈üin-Elbistan C may not be constructed, despite a government guarantee to purchase electricity from lignite-fired power stations until 2024 at an inflation-linked price. Turkey's climate-change policy includes an increase in the economic life of coal reserves. , the government aimed to keep the share of coal in the energy portfolio at around the same level in the medium and long term. The national development bank, the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey, says that it has implemented a sustainable business model and sustainability-themed investments have a 74-percent share of the bank‚Äôs loan portfolio. Turkey's Green Party is calling for an end to coal burning and the phasing out of all fossil-fuel use by 2050. =Paris Agreement and transboundary environmental impact treaties not ratified= According to the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, climate change is one of the world's biggest problems. Like neighboring Iran and Iraq, Turkey is one of the few countries which have not ratified the Paris Agreement and has refused to ratify until it receives more international loans for emission reduction and renewable-energy investments. The EU is urging Turkey to ratify the agreement. Turkey is not party to the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context (Espoo Convention). =Media= Electricity generated from lignite is often described by politicians and the media as generated from \\"local resources\\" and added to the renewables percentage; Daily Sabah reported that \\"Turkey's electricity production from local and renewable resources stood at 62 percent\\" in 2019, and coal is described as \\"black diamonds\\" by the Anadolu Agency. =Children's-rights petition and lawsuit= Environmental activist Greta Thunberg and 15 other children filed a petition in 2019 protesting lack of action on the climate crisis by Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, and Turkey saying that, amongst other dangers, more deadly heat waves would affect them and other children in future. The petition challenged the five countries under the Convention on the Rights of the Child: \\"Comparable emissions to Turkey‚Äôs rate of emissions would lead to more than 4¬∞C of warming.\\" If the petition is successful, the countries will be asked to respond; however, any suggestions are not legally binding. In 2020, Turkey and 32 other countries were sued at the European Court of Human Rights by a group of Portuguese children. Action plans Antalya, Bornova, Bursa, √áankaya, Eski≈üehir Tepeba≈üƒ±, Gaziantep, ƒ∞zmir, Kadikoy, Maltepe, Nil√ºfer and Seferihisar have action plans. Perspectives According to journalist Pelin Cengiz, mainstream Turkish media tends to view new coal-fired power stations as increasing employment rather than causing climate change; nearly all media owners have financial interests in fossil fuels. ≈ûahin and T√ºrkkan wrote that the media covers climate change only during extreme weather events, with insufficient expert opinions or civil-society perspectives. Some construction companies have been accused of greenwashing, advertising their buildings as environmentally friendly without obtaining any green building certificates. In a 2019 E3G poll of six Belt and Road Initiative countries (including Turkey), solar was the most popular energy source and coal the least popular. Twenty-four Turkish cities committed to the Paris Agreement targets that year, and the United Nations Development Programme partnered with the Turkish Basketball Federation in 2020 to raise public awareness of the fight against climate change. Trends, research and data access Net Turkish greenhouse gas emissions by year Energy research is conducted at Sabancƒ± University's Shura Energy Transition Center. The UNFCCC has requested more-detailed emissions projections in Turkey's annual reports to generate Shared Socioeconomic Pathways; integrated assessment models developed by I≈üƒ±k University and Bosphorus University are used for non-energy emissions. Emissions from industry have been modelled by the Energy Ministry and the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey using TIMES-MACRO. About 800 entities, including power plants over 20 MW, send measurements of their GHG emissions to the government. Unlike the public sharing of data in the European Union Emission Trading Scheme, , monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) data in Turkey was not public (although some companies report voluntarily). Quantitative estimates of the impact of individual government policies on greenhouse gas emissions have not been made or are not publicly available; neither are projections of long-term (to 2050) policy impacts. Up-to-date GDP and population-growth forecasts have not been incorporated into models, and assumptions such as future energy intensity, energy demand and electricity consumption are unknown; whether sensitivity analysis of GHG scenarios has been conducted is also unknown. Turkey has told the UNFCCC that many details needed to understand GHG past trends and future projections \\"could not be provided for confidentiality reasons.\\" Although a number of issues raised in inventory reviews have been resolved, dozens more have been outstanding for over three years.

He participated in the 2018 Papua gubernatorial election, but lost to incumbent Lukas Enembe. Background He was born on 15 September 1972 in the kampung of Hulekaima in the Maima district of Jayawijaya Regency. Coming from the Dani tribe, he is the only son of Habel Wetipo and did his basic education in missionary schools. Later, he moved to Jayapura for his highschool. After completing basic education, he studied for 3 years in Manado's Tourism Academy. Later, he graduated from a bachelor's and a master's program at Cenderawasih University. Career Wetipo began working as a civil servant in 1996, and later became the head of the tourism agency for the regency. He later participated in the regency's first direct election in 2008 and won, being sworn in on 24 December 2008. As regent, Wetipo initiated the Baliem Valley Cultural Festival, intended to draw tourists to the otherwise remote regency. He received an award from the Corruption Eradication Commission for wealth reporting and from the Ministry of Finance for financial management in Jayawijaya.

It was built in 1867. It is also known as the Valley Heights Gatekeeper's Cottage. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The 1867 sandstone cottage is one of twelve virually identical constructed at the time of the western railway line expansion. The gatekeepers would close and re-open the gate over the railway line when trains were scheduled. Interestingly, there were two such crossings at Valley Heights plus one nearby at Springwood (still extant as part of a child care centre). Because the railway shared a narrow ridge with existing road systems from the 1860s onwards, numerous level crossings were required. Twelve of these were guarded by gates controlled from a gatekeeper's cottage. Six of the original stone cottages of 1867 survive, but only four are habitable and on their original sites. The other surviving gatehouses are located at Lapstone, , Medlow Bath and Mount Victoria.ECO Design Architects, 2010  Description  A single storey cottage with intersecting gables facing north to the railway line and set below the railway embankment. The main gable is on the east-west axis with the intersecting gable centrally located on the north side of the house. A skillion roof porch is on the west side of the north gable. A rear skillion roof is on the south side of the house. The roof is of corrugated steel and the chimney is sandstone. The walls are random coursed sparrowpicked sandstone with rockfaced quoins at the openings and corners. The gables have slot vents. The front door is on the west side of the north wing, entered from the skillion porch. The windows are two over two-pane double hung, except the pair of narrow double hung windows in the north gabled front. The south yard has a natural rock shelf.

It was designed by engineer William Julius Baltzer of the New South Wales Public Works Department and built by the Department from 1897 to 1898. The property is owned by Sydney Water. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  Lilyfield was first developed as large rural estates granted to prominent early settlers between 1794 and 1819. The area comprising the subject site was part of 165 acres granted to John Piper in 1811. Like many original grantees here, Piper did not occupy the land. In the 1870s intensive subdivision of the large Leichhardt estates began. By 1875 the main street network, including White Street and Piper Street, was firmly established. Lilyfield however remained a suburban frontier until the early 20th century. During the 1880s Sydney was expanding rapidly due to the boom conditions and large influx of immigrants. Public works, such as water supply and sewerage schemes, were a major feature of these hectic years. When the large sewer main was planned in 1883 to drain most of the suburbs on the southern side of the harbour to the Bondi Outfall, it was found necessary to carry a branch sewer to service the western areas.Brooks et al, 2009, 5 On 25 April 1892 the Minister for Public Works resumed a parcel of land (2 roods and 29 perches) on the southern side of Piper Street for carrying out the upstream extension of the Northern Main Sewer. The Whites Creek sewer aqueduct was completed in 1897. It was constructed as an extension of the Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer, then known as the Northern Main Sewer. This carried sewage from the densely populated inner-western suburbs of Balmain, Annandale and Glebe. The sewer necessitated the crossing of the 'Johnstone's Creek Valley' and 'White's Creek Valley' to deliver the sewage to the ocean outfall junction at the Junction of Parramatta and City Roads. The Main Northern Sewer was one of the Board's major early sewer systems. The section of Northern Main Sewer, which embraces the aqueducts across Johnstone's and White's Creeks, was constructed under Government Contract No. 77 (basically the area between Catherine Street and Minogue Crescent). The design work for this contract was completed by early 1895. This proposed a sewer carrier supported on mass concrete and brick arches, and a lattice bridge. This scheme was subsequently abandoned in favour of using a carrier and supporting arches of reinforced concrete construction, the contract for which was let in mid 1896. The engineer credited with the design is W. J. Baltzer, an engineer in the Sewerage Branch of the Department of Public Works. Baltzer, a graduate of a German university, worked for the firm Carter Gummow & Co. which held the patent rights for the Monier system of reinforcing concrete. Carter Gummow & Co were instrumental in bringing reinforced construction into widespread use. The design provided for a sewer carrier internally U shaped in section 3-ft. 6-in (1m.) by 4 ft. 6-in (1.37 m) constructed in reinforced concrete. The sewer carrier is supported by a series of arches: there are 9 large spans, each of 81-ft 10-in (25 m.) centre to centre with a clear span of 75-ft (23 m.), and a number of smaller subsidiary arches at the western edge. The total length is 990-ft. (301.7 m.). Each of the arches is seated on mass concrete piers. The aqueduct has required only minor repairs in the first 90 years of its existence. The first major renovation of the Monier arch aqueducts was necessary in 1986, when it was fitted with a new liner. Since 1990 the aqueduct has been listed on the NSW State Heritage Register, Register of the National Estate, Leichhardt Local Environmental Plan, Sydney Water Corporation's section 170 Heritage & Conservation Register and classified by the National Trust of Australia (NSW) in recognition of its significant technical accomplishment and as a major element of the historic built environment. The western section of the original site (21 & 1/2 perches) was transferred to the Municipality of Leichhardt in 1926 for widening of Edna Street. The remaining area (2 roods & 6 3/4 perches) accommodates the underground section of the structure and has been used for Sydney Water operations as a maintenance depot.Brooks et al, 2009, 6 The aqueduct has required only minor repairs in the first 90 years of its existence. It was repaired 1986, consisting of the insertion of a plastic liner in the flume. The arches are in a stable condition.  Description  The White's Creek Aqueduct is an original key component of the upstream extension of the BOOS (then called the Main Northern Sewer). It presently carries the sewage derived from the Balmain/Annandale areas across Whites Creek on its journey to the ocean at Bondi. Externally, it has a rectangular conduit with an internal U shape approx. wide by approx. deep, and is carried by eight main brick arches, each of centre to centre, and a number of minor arches. The total length of the span is 15 chains. The boundary of the structure forms a triangle giving a maximum of clearance form the external edges of the structure. This channel drains an area of lying to the south of Rozelle Bay and is located approximately between Balmain Road, Leichhardt and Johnston Street, Annandale. The catchment area of the channel is comprised within the Municipalities of Leichhardt and Marrickville. From the outlet in Rozelle Bay the drain proceeds in a meandering course in a southerly direction crossing Brennan, Piper, Booth, Styles and Albion Streets before terminating at Parramatta Road. The channel is in length and is predominantly brick (56%) and concrete (42%) in fabric. The channel cross section is composed of the following; circular (38%), covered (30%) and open channel (27%). The main channel has the following Branches stemming from it; Piper Street, Moore Street Styles Street and Parramatta Road. The size of the channel outlet is . Part of the stormwater drain runs through Whites Creek Valley Park, a picturesque recreational area. Various bridges are built over the channel and they add to the historic and aesthetic values of the drain. In addition the highly significant Whites Creek Aqueduct (Bondi sewer) passes overhead.  Heritage listing  The Whites Creek sewage aqueduct was completed in 1897 and is a major and highly visible component of the Northern Main Sewer extension of the Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer. The arches and carrier of the aqueduct are one of the first major constructions undertaken using reinforced concrete in NSW and one of the first in Australia. The slender proportions of the supporting arches and sewage carrier along with its historical technology value are a major landmark for Sydney. The aqueduct is a major element of the historic built environment of the local area, and a long held part of the recreational reserve. Elements of significance are the past and ongoing use, technology of construction and setting (inclusive of views) within the park reserve. White's Creek Aqueduct was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Whites Creek sewage aqueduct is a major and highly visible component of the Northern Main Sewer extension of the Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer completed in 1897. The extension provided for the sewerage of the areas of densely populated inner-western suburbs of Balmain, Annandale and Glebe. The aqueduct is particularly associated with the engineer W. J. Baltzer, and the firm Carter Gummow & Co. early advocates of the use of reinforced concrete (the Monier system) in this country of which this is one. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The sewage aqueduct is a prominent element in the historic built environment of Annandale. The aqueduct in consideration of its length, height and slender proportions is an impressive sight , and a landmark in Sydney. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The aqueduct is a major element of the historic built environment of the local government area of Leichhardt and provides a focus for an understanding to the contemporary community of the historical development of the local area. It is listed by the National Trust of Australia (NSW), the Australian Heritage Commission, and the Institution of Engineers. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The aqueduct is one of the first major constructions undertaken using reinforced concrete in NSW and one of the first in Australia. The built fabric is therefore a unique repository for the study of the early development of reinforced construction. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Rare in Australia in consideration of the extent and date of the reinforced construction technique. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

Their plans work out well as the church did not make the news public but expels her from her service as she becomes pregnant. Later Riyaz starts to feel guilty and pleads with her to marry him but she objects. Later the film ends with Riyaz committing suicide outside Aneeta's house.

In 1914 he volunteered to join the army when war broke out. Sent to fight on the Eastern Front, he became politicised and radicalised, especially as the ideas behind the Russian Revolution filtered through to the German troops. After the war he joined first the Social Democratic Party and then, in 1920, the recently launched Communist Party of Germany. He served as a regional member (\\"Landtagsabgeordneter\\") of parliament in the Saxon parliament (\\"Landtag\\") between 1921 and 1924, and then between 1924 and 1933 as a member (\\"Reichstagsabgeordneter\\") of the national parliament (\\"Reichstag\\"). He was arrested in 1933 and imprisoned. Transfer to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp followed in 1939. On 11 October 1944 Ernst Schneller was one of 24 German camp inmates deemed culpable of \\"illegal activities\\", taken out, and together with three French antifascists shot dead by Nazi paramilitaries (SS).  Life  = Provenance and early years = Ernst Schneller was born in Leipzig, the sixth child of a railway official. His father was also a veteran of the Royal Saxon Army. His father died in 1895 but there are nevertheless indications that aspects of the family's military tradition were inherited by the son. He attended a teacher training institution from which he briefly withdrew in 1910 under circumstances that remain unclear. He nevertheless passed the necessary exams to become a teaching assistant, and worked in this capacity from 1911 till 1913 at Kirchberg im Erzgebirge, a small town in the mining region south of Zwickau. He then passed more exams and became a qualified teacher, moving to a school in Leipzig. War broke out in July 1914 and Schneller unhesitatingly volunteered for military service. In 1916 he was sent on an officers' training course, after which he was promoted to the rank of Leutnant. Further promotions followed. By 1917/1918, still on the Eastern Front, Ernst Schneller was serving as a \\"Bataillonsadjutant\\". He also found time, in 1916, to marry Hilde (1894‚Äì1989). = A return to teaching amid postwar instability = Military defeat in November 1918 was quickly followed by a succession of revolutionary outbursts at the ports and then in the German towns and cities. Revolutionary sentiments were also prevalent among soldiers in the defeated armies, especially on the Eastern Front where Ernst Schneller was one of those elected to membership of a Soldiers' Council (sometimes translated as \\"Soldiers' soviet\\"). In January 1919 he returned home to what had been, till a few weeks earlier, the Kingdom of Saxony. He settled in Schwarzenberg (a small town south of Chemnitz) and resumed his teaching career in March 1919, taking a position which in the meantime his wife had been filling on his behalf. He also took a conscious decision to become involved in politics and work for the \\"elimination of capitalist exploitation\\". At a time of political polarisation, left-wingers on the town council had objected to the appointment of a former army officer as a teacher in the local school, but the objections were withdrawn a few weeks later when Ernst Schneller joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). He also joined the town council. An apolitical small-town school teacher who had been a nationalist before the war had now become radicalised. Widespread destitution, intensified by the burden on government finances of war reparations and, later, currency collapse, gave rise to continuing political instability across the country during the early 1920s. One symptom was the existence of various right-wing \\"Freikorps\\" militias, composed of unemployed former soldiers, many of whom hankered after a return to pre-war conditions. The Kapp Putsch in March 1920 was a revolt against continuing economic austerity and an attempt to topple the republican constitution put in place during 1919. It failed. In Schwarzenberg, putting his military experience at the service of the post-imperial status quo, Ernst Schneller organised a form of workers' militia which was effective in resisting right-wing backers of the putsch. He found himself working closely with members of the Communist Party and was, according to one source, \\"impressed by the consistency of their approach\\". By November 1920 Ernst Schneller had joined the recently launched Communist Party of Germany. = Landtag member = In November 1920 the party nominated him as a candidate for election to the regional parliament (\\"S√§chsischer Landtag\\"), which was based in Leipzig. However, the communists polled only 5.7% of the total vote in the election in Saxony, and Schneller narrowly failed to gain a seat. However, on 23 March 1921 Gottfried Weimer, a Communist who had been elected to the parliament, retired and in April 1921 his seat passed to Schneller. In the parliament he spoke frequently on his specialist subject, calling for what amounted to a revolution on public education. Tireless campaigning on behalf of children and young people became a long-standing theme of his political career. Aspects of his party's policy which he advocated on the floor of the parliament included free school meals and access to \\"learning resources\\" along with free medical and dental check- ups for school children and pre-school children. His military skills again came into play during the 1921 March Action (brief uprising) which this time was a Communist-led insurrection, though sources are unclear as to the nature and extent of his involvement. During 1921 there are indications that Schneller may have been drawing close to Paul Levi and his group of \\"moderates\\" within the Communist Party. However, he remained a loyal Communist Party member after Levi, who had started 1921 as party leader, was excluded from it. At the end of 1921 Schneller himself was elected to head up the local party leadership team for the Aue-Schwarzenberg sub-district. He nevertheless still managed to combine his various political roles and responsibilities with his work as a school teacher, leading what some regarded as a somewhat ascetic existence. He avoided alcohol. By 1923 he was closely associated with the party leadership around Heinrich Brandler, who in 1923 entrusted him with building up the para-military Proletarische Hundertschaften (loosely, \\"Proletarian Centurions\\") in Saxony (within which he took a leadership role) and other quasi-military tasks. Involvement in the Hamburg Uprising in October 1923 led to his suffering a period of what one source describes as \\"persecution by the regime's justice system\\" (\\"...von der Weimarer Justiz verfolgt\\"). He was briefly arrested and then, because of his connections to the Communist Party, dismissed from the schools service in November 1924. Elsewhere it is stated unambiguously that he resigned from the schools service of his own volition. Either way, the loss of his teaching job opened the way for a switch to national politics, and he moved to Berlin, becoming a salaried party official. The events of October 1923 were widely seen within the party as a set-back, and Schneller's immediate reaction was to swing towards the moderate faction: shortly before the 1924 Party Conference in Frankfurt, however, he declared his allegiance to the left-wing in a party that was always prone to acute and sometimes destructive outbursts of factionalism. = Reichstag and Central Committee member = In December 1924 Schneller successfully stood for election to the national parliament (\\"Reichstag\\"). He sat as a Communist Party member, representing Electoral District 30 (Chemnitz‚ÄìZwickau) from the end of 1924 till 1933. His entry in the official Parliamentary directory (\\"Reichstags-Handbuch\\") is unusually brief: it describes him as a \\"teacher in Schwarzenberg (Saxony)\\" and as a \\"dissident\\". The Ninth Party Congress was held at Frankfurt in April 1924. At it Ernst Schneller was one of the fifteen delegates elected to membership of the powerful \\"Parteizentrale\\", precursor to the Party Central Committee and effectively the governing body of the party. Within that committee he took responsibility for important military and organisational matters. In 1925 he was elected to take charge of the National Party Academy (\\"Reichsparteischule Rosa Luxemburg\\") at Sch√∂neiche‚ÄìFichtenau. After moving to Berlin and becoming a full-time party official at the end of 1924 he became identified as an adherent of the Ruth Fischer leadership faction in the party. Fischer had been appointed co-leader of the party in April and was identified as a resolute \\"anti-Stalinist\\". Schneller was soon given responsibility for the department in charge of \\"Theoretical work\\" and \\"Agitprop\\". During 1924 the Fischer-Maslow leadership team came under increasing pressure from committed pro-Stalinists within the party, and early in 1925, as the influence of Karl Korsch and the \\"ultra-left-wingers\\" increased at the expense of the formal party leadership, Schneller became the publisher of the theoretical newspaper \\"Internationale\\" and leader of the \\"Marxist-Leninist Circle\\". He quickly made himself as reputation as a leading proponent of the \\"Struggle against Trotskyism and Luxemburgism\\", which implicitly but unambiguously meant that he was now lining up with the pro-Stalinists. The Tenth Party Congress was held at Berlin in July 1925. The \\"Parteizentrale\\" was replaced by a Party Central Committee and now had eighteen members. One of these, as before, was Ernst Schneller. He presented the Report of the \\"Parteizentrale\\" to the assembled delegates and was treated as \\"general secretary\\", although the position was not one that, formally, yet existed within the party. After the death of Lenin in 1924 the power of Stalin in Moscow appears to have become almost limitless. There were close links between the Communist Party leaderships in Moscow and Berlin, and Stalin seems to have become virtually a \\"de facto king-maker\\" for the German party, which in part was a reflection of the acute divisions within the German party itself. To the disappointment of some, it turned out that Stalin was not an admirer of Karl Korsch and the \\"ultra-left-wingers\\". Nevertheless, for the next few years, until the Communist Party of Germany finally split in 1928/29, the defining division within it was between pro-Stalinists and anti-Stalinists (generally identified by Stalin himself as Trotskyists). Ernst Th√§lmann, the Central Committee member who emerged as leader of the Communist Party of Germany in October 1925, was a pro-Stalinist. Ernst Schneller emerged as an enthusiastic Th√§lmann backer with a level of haste that, even in the context of the rapidly shifting inner workings of the German Communist Party at that time, attracted a certain level of disbelief and some derision. Over in Moscow, Nikolai Bukharin went on record with a description of Schneller as a \\"without political character\\" (\\"politisch charakterloses Subjekt\\"). Party opponents quipped that Schneller played an important role within the party only because he was \\"smarter than Ernst Th√§lmann and more hard working than Philipp Dengel\\" (\\"kl√ºger als Ernst Th√§lmann und flei√üiger als Philipp Dengel\\"). Schneller did indeed receive important appointments under the new leadership, becoming \\"Polleiter\\" (loosely, \\"Head of Policy\\") with the party leadership team (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") in the party's Erzgebirge-Vogtland. He arrived with an instruction from the national party leadership to isolate the left-wingers around Paul Bertz and Heinrich Wesche. At the Eleventh Party Congress, held at Essen in March 1927, he was re-elected to the Party Central Committee, now swollen to 35 members. He was also re-elected to its inner \\"Politburo\\". = Career peak = During 1927/28 Schneller was intensively involved in party attempts to uncover the Lohman Affair (\\"Phoebus Scandal\\"), a conspiracy of some complexity which lasted for several years and involved a bankrupt film company and various attempts by or on behalf of the government to fund covert rearmament. In 1928 the German party sent Schneller to Moscow as a delegate for the Sixth World Congress of the Comintern. He was appointed to the candidates' list for the powerful Comintern Executive Committee (ECCI / –ò–ö–ö–ò). He would never make it to membership of the committee, however. It was also in 1928 that Ernst Th√§lmann's comrade and close friend, John Wittorf from the Hamburg party leadership, was involved in a major embezzlement scandal. On 26 September 1928 a meeting of the Central Committee took place at which Ernst Th√§lmann, like other party leaders before him, was removed from the leadership. The meeting was chaired by Schneller. However, Th√§lmann arranged for the matter to be referred to the ECCI in Moscow, which gave Stalin the opportunity to reverse Th√§lmann's removal. The German party's Central; Committee decision to condemn Th√§lmann had been \\"mistaken\\". The result was that Ernst Th√§lmann was rapidly \\"rehabilitated\\" and restored to the leadership: the Communist Party of Germany fell more firmly under Moscow's control than ever. The result of the \\"error\\" for Ernst Schneller was rapid removal from the Politburo. The Twelfth Party Congress was held in the Wedding quarter of Berlin in June 1929. This time thirty-eight comrades were elected to Central Committee membership. Ernst Schneller was no longer among them, however. He was nevertheless given a job by the Central Committee, in the \\"Business department\\" (\\"Gesch√§ftsabteilung\\") where for some months he was made responsible for \\"party printed matter\\". His return to grace was only partial. However, at the Party Conference in October 1932 he was again given management-level responsibilities and then readmitted to the Central Committee. He took over the information Department. A few months later everything changed. The National Socialists took power in January 1933 and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Political activity (except in support of the National Socialists) became illegal, but it very soon became clear that the authorities were keen to pursue with particular fervour those who were or had been Communist Party members. Ernst Schneller position was particularly exposed because his leadership role over many years in respect of the Communist Party's \\"military-political\\" work meant that he had a higher public profile than most party officials. On 7 February 1933 Schneller was one of the participants at the \\"illegal\\" Sporthaus Ziegenhals meeting, celebrated subsequently (especially during the \\"East German\\" years) as the last meeting held by the German Communist Party leadership before the participants were arrested and killed or, in some cases, managed to escape abroad. = A Communist leader in Germany under National Socialism = The Reichstag fire took place on the night of 27 February 1933. Although the government, with almost indecent haste, identified it as part of a communist plot, many took the view that it was actually the government that appeared to have planned for such an eventuality. Several leading members of the Communist Party were promptly arrested. Ernst Schneller was among those arrested overnight in Berlin on 27/28 February 1933 and taken to the \\"Investigatory Prison\\" in Berlin-Moabit. Because of the dangers inherent in the political situation, communist leaders had been instructed by the party not to stay with their families: Schneller was at home with his family in defiance of those instructions when the police came for him. The authorities immediately launched a rumour to the effect that he had defected to the National Socialists and betrayed party-leader Th√§lmann. Initially this item of fake news was widely believed, even in Communist circles. In April 1933 he was transferred to the newly opened Sonnenburg concentration camp. Schneller was moved again on 8 July 1933, this time to a penitentiary in Leipzig (\\"Gefangenenanstalt II\\") where he was held in investigatory detention. On 9 November 1933 he faced trial at the Supreme Court in Leipzig. Convicted of incitement to high treason, he was sentenced to six year's imprisonment and five years of deprivation of citizens' rights (\\"Ehrverlust\\"). On 16 November 1933 he was removed to the Waldheim Penitentiary where, for the next six years, he was held in solitary confinement. In July 1939, his jail term having been completed, Schneller was transferred to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp where he was identified as Prisoner 764. He was later assigned a new number, \\"1181715\\". He was seconded to the \\"Klinkerwerk\\", effectively a large heavy-tile factory in the concentration camp. The work was inhumanly heavy and there is a report of an occasion when he collapsed, but with the support of comrades he recovered rapidly. In the camp he became one of the leaders of an illegal Communist party group among the inmates: he was able to ensure that the group were able to stay informed about political and military developments in the world outside. In March 1944 an SS guard discovered leaflets and a radio belonging to the group, which is probably connected with reports that the communist group within the camp were planning some sort of an insurrection and a mass escape. The group was quickly infiltrated with spies. A major operation against the group took place on 11 August 1944 after which 150 inmates were moved to \\"isolation bloc 58\\". On 11 October 1944 103 of these were moved to the Mauthausen concentration camp near Linz. A further 27 ‚Äì mostly communists ‚Äì were taken out and shot dead by Nazi paramilitaries (SS). Those killed included Ernst Schneller as well as Mathias Thesen, Ludger Zollikofer, Rudolf Hennig und Gustl Sandtner.Hermann Langbein: ‚Ä¶nicht wie die Schafe zur Schlachtbank ‚Äì Widerstand in den nationalsozialistischen Konzentrationslagern. Frankfurt am Main 1980, p. 227f.  Family  Ernst and Hilde Schneller married in 1916. After Ernst Schneller was arrested their daughter Annemarie (later Annemarie Raeder) was looked after by Arthur Rackwitz, a Lutheran pastor who in various ways played a quietly heroic role during the Hitler years. The Schnellers also had a son: Helmut Schneller (1922‚Äì2010) later made a reputation for himself as an author in the German Democratic Republic. He worked between 1953 and 1990 as \\"cabaret author\\" at East Berlin's Distel Cabaret Theatre, and liked to claim that his work at the cabaret was primarily motivated (till 1990) by the constant game he played with the censor.  Celebration  In the German Democratic Republic, which functioned as a Soviet sponsored separate version of Germany between 1949 and 1989/90, there was an Ernst Schneller Street or an Ernst Schneller Square or an Ernst Schneller School or college in very many towns and cities. There was an Ernst Schneller Barracks in Berlin-Alt-Treptow. There was a Special Home for looking after and monitoring troubled children and young people in Eilenburg named after Schneller. On 3 September 1973 a company of \\"missile troops\\" (\\"Gescho√üwerfertruppenteil\\") in the National People's Army was assigned his name. Many of these very public celebrations of Ernst Schneller were renamed following the 1990 reunification, but there are still plenty of towns and cities left in former East Germany with their own \\"Ernst Schneller Strasse\\" (\\"Ernst Schneller Street\\"). These include Leipzig, Halle, Erfurt, Jena and Heidenau. A 150m¬≤ ocean-yacht used between 1954 and 1989/90 by the \\"August L√ºtgens GTS naval school\\" also carried his name. The sports-yacht was subsequently sold to the municipality of Aklam and renamed \\"Arms of Aklam\\".Lutz Mohr: Schulschiffe unter Segel und Motor.

Elmenhorst: EDITION POMMERN 2012, , p. 68 The Ernst Schneller Medal for sporting achievement in the \\"Sport and Technology Society\\" (\\"Gesellschaft f√ºr Sport und Technik\\" / GTS) was inaugurated in 1961. In 1977 the East German Television Service (\\"Deutscher Fernsehfunk\\" / DFF) produced a biographical film about Schneller. Horst Schulze took the part of Ernst Schneller. The part of his wife Hilde was played by a leading star of East German cinema, Renate Blume. Schneller featured again in the 1986 DFF biographical film about Ernst Th√§lmann. This time Schneller was portrayed by Wilfried Pucher. In September 1992 a Memorial to the Murdered Members of the Reichstag was erected in front of the Reichstag building in Berlin. Ernst Schneller is one of the 96 commemorated on it. On 11 October 2014 the memorial piece \\"Klang der Erinnerung\\" (\\"Voice of remembering\\") by arts student Eva Susanne Schmidhuber was unveiled at the Sachsenhausen Memorial Centre. Schmidhuber's work commemorates 27 prisoners shot dead at the concentration camp seventy years before. It was selected as part of an arts competition arranged by the Berlin-Wei√üensee Arts Academy in collaboration with the surviving friends and relatives of the victims.

Biography  Sergeev was born on June 21, 1964. He studied at Zaporozhye Boarding School No. 2. While still a minor, he was sentenced to a year in prison for hooliganism. After his release, he worked as a photographer at the Zaporozhia mining company. He often clashed with his mother, who once wrote a statement to the police about him, and Sergey was detained at the Zhovtevy ROVD. He was diagnosed with a psychoneurological disorder. According to different versions, he either fled from there, or managed to convince the staff that he was not insane.  Murders  He committed his first murder on June 27, 1987, in Yalta. He met a student named Tatyana Novik, from Leningrad, and proposed marriage only a few days later. When she refused, he strangled her in a fit of rage and then fled, leaving a note on the corpse: Sergeev often left notes at the locations of his crimes, and once even left an audio cassette containing various threats and bullying directed at the officers: At the site of another murder (that of Alla Boyko), he left a note drenched in the victim's blood: \\"People are dying like flies.\\" On June 29 Sergeev broke into a factory on Dzerzhinsky Street in Zaporozhia, stole several ushankas (Russian fur hats with ear flaps) and gold ornaments, and killed a cleaning woman, Natalia Yurchenko. On the same day he broke into his ex-girlfriend's apartment and stabbed her new boyfriend several times with a knife. Sergeev then moved to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. He wounded a farm manager in the Synelnykove Raion (district) and stole 650 rubles from the farm's collective fund, then hid out in the steppe and local villages. On July 9, 1987, he returned to Zaporozhia, bursting into an apartment on Paramanov Street and inflicting serious wounds on nine-year-old Lena Novikova. On July 10 he broke into an apartment on Gorky Street and killed 84-year-old Alla Boyko. On July 12, he attacked two teenagers with a knife while they were bathing in a pond near a village in the Prymorsk Raion, but both of them survived.  Arrest  Residents of Zaporizhia began to panic. To catch the killer, servicemen, troops, fire brigade workers, aviation crews and volunteers were organized in the 587 settlements of Zaporizhia Oblast. The head of the search operations was Alexander Polyak, who would later become mayor of Zaporizhia. On July 17, 1987, Sergeev was found near the state-run farm Mokryanka, and was finally detained near the village of Krinichka. He attempted to resist arrest by throwing a knife at police, but an officer shot him in the leg and he was taken into custody.  Trial and execution  Sergeev attempted an insanity plea, bolstering his case by killing another prisoner. Despite this attempt, he was sentenced to death and subsequently executed by firing squad in 1989.  References   External links  * Akbash: \\"The killer Sergey Sergeev: how it was\\".

Newby Memorial Building. Anna Shelton Hall. The Woman's Club in 2017. The Woman's Club of Fort Worth is one of the city's oldest membership organizations, formed in 1923 by the members of several existing woman's clubs. The Woman's Club complex comprises eight historic buildings on Fort Worth's Near Southside and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. As with many woman's clubs in the United States, the Woman's Club of Fort Worth has its roots in the Progressive Movement, with its original mission of \\"the cultural and civic advancement of Fort Worth; and the study of literature, history, science, painting, music, and other fine arts.\\"  History  Local businesswoman Anna Shelton (1861-1939) recognized the need to bring together Fort Worth's many disparate woman's clubs into one umbrella organization with a shared physical space. Representatives of eleven local woman's clubs met at the First Christian Church in January 1923 to form the new organization; the eleven charter clubs included the Fort Worth Federation of Women's Clubs, the Woman's Wednesday Club, the Monday Book Club, '93 Club, Sorosis Club, Shakespeare Club, Penelope Club, Euterpean Club (named after the Greek muse, Euterpe), History Club, College Women's Club, and the Harmony Club. Both the Fort Worth Federation of Women's Clubs and Sorosis Clubs were established members of the Texas Federation of Women's Clubs. The Fort Worth Garden Club was organized in 1926 under the auspices of The Woman's Club but did not become a formal member. A member of the '93 Club, Sorosis Club, and state representative at national women's club conventions, Anna Shelton became the club's first president in 1923, a position she held until shortly before her death in 1939. The same year, Etta O. Newby, a Fort Worth woman who was not a member of any woman's clubs, donated a residence on Pennsylvania Avenue in Fort Worth's Quality Hill neighborhood to the organization in memory of her late husband. The mansion was then occupied by military personnel as the United States Office of Alien Property Custodian had assumed ownership of the property when its German owners were stranded in Europe during World War I. The deed of gift transferring ownership of the building, to be named the William G. Newby Memorial Building, to the Woman's Club limited its use to white women engaging in educational and cultural activities; the deed also forbade drinking, smoking, and gambling on the premises. Perhaps remarkably, Newby's smoking ban was the only controversial term of the gift at the time, as factions of club leaders faced off, with Anna Shelton supporting the ban and library director Jennie Scott Scheuber \\"championing the cause of women's right to smoke.\\" In 1931, the Woman's Club of Fort Worth became the first in Texas with its own radio show on KFJZ, which was owned by Margaret Meacham, a prominent club member. The same year, the club assumed management of the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra, holding concerts in the Central High School auditorium; operations were handed back to the symphony's board in 1938. In 1932, the club started its Texas Library, which today holds a respected collection of rare books and Texana. The Texas Federation of Women's Clubs also used the Newby building as their headquarters until their own building was completed in Austin in 1933. The Woman's Club played an active role in the 1936 Frontier Centennial, Fort Worth's celebration of the Texas centennial, operating a Texas history speakers bureau and a small history museum on the event grounds. They also organized a Texas Centennial scrapbook project and a program to place Texas history books in local school libraries. Notable speakers at the club during the 1930s through 1950s include Gertrude Stein, Ogden Nash, Grant Wood, John Erskine, Robert St. John, and Alan Mowbray. During this period, the club supported many local children's and medical charities, Red Cross, Fort Worth Public Library, and provided free music and art lessons to children. In 1970, the club's original charter was updated to comply with tax laws for non-profit organizations; this included the removal of the clause limiting membership to white women and creation of plans for distribution of assets in the event of the organization's dissolution. In 1993, the club established a historic preservation trust to care for the buildings and grounds.  Buildings and grounds  The Woman's Club of Fort Worth occupies a site on Pennsylvania Avenue in Fort Worth's Near Southside, and includes structures in the Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, Italian Renaissance Revival, and Craftsman styles. All structures in the complex are painted \\"antique Spanish white\\" to unify the disparate architectural styles. Four former residences built between 1903 and 1911, all originally part of the Quality Hill neighborhood, comprise the main buildings. Notable structures include: The landscape architecture firm of Hare & Hare, which the Fort Worth park board secured to develop the city parks master plan, designed the club's grounds in 1926 as a gift to the Fort Worth Garden Club.

The specific epithet brevior means \\"shorter\\" in Latin. Description Carex brevior forms dense tufts with short-prolonged rhizomes, the clumps sometimes appearing elongated. The flowering culms are tall with 3 to 5 leaves per culm. Few vegetative culms are produced and unlike some other sedges, they are not strikingly 3-ranked. The leaf sheaths are white and papery and the ligule is long. The inflorescence is open, brown, up to long with between 3 and 7 distant, distinct spikes per culm. Each spike is ovoid or ellipsoide, typically attenuate at the base and acute or rounded at the tip, with 15‚Äì40 lenticular perigynia. The perigynia are green to reddish brown, orbiculate to broadly ovate, and typically long and across (1.2‚Äì1.8 times as long as wide). Carex brevior flowers in mid-May and early June, fruiting in the early to mid summer. A member of Carex sect. Ovales, it is commonly confused with other closely related species such as Carex molesta, C. molestiformis, and C. cumulata. These species share general fruiting characteristics, with \\"broad perigynia that tend to be widest near the middle of the body and achenes that are broadly elliptic to round\\". C. cumulata has perigynia that are more rhombic due to its narrowed wings beyond the middle of the perigynia and the nearly cuneate base. A heteroecious rust fungus, Puccinia dioicae, infects the foliage of Carex brevior, forming brownish spots and blemishes. Distribution and habitat Carex brevior has a broad distribution in North America, encompassing most of the continental United States and southern Canada, south to Tamaulipas, Mexico. Its habitats include dry-mesic to dry prairies, meadows, along railroads, and open woodlands, usually in sandy soils and commonly in areas of disturbance. Specimens found in disturbed habitats in parts of the Southeastern United States may be introduced populations.

History Silver was first discovered in the area in 1865. In 1868, additional silver lodes were found near the settlement. A mining district was established, but mining was difficult due to insufficient water supplies. Water had to be transported by mules from springs 12 miles away. The settlement had a population of fifty miners in 1870. When the stamp-mill in nearby Crescent was shut down in 1871, mining in Tempiute was abandoned. The post office was named Tem Piute from February 1879 until January 1881 and then again from June 1882 until January 1883. Tungsten ore was discovered nearby in 1916, but large- scale mining did not begin for another twenty years. The Lincoln Mines Company initiated mining operations in Tempiute in 1940 after building a mill. The mines were productive until the end of World War II, but declined in the next five years. After the price of tungsten rose in 1950, the mining camp was reestablished when the Wah Chang Trading Company, a New York-based tungsten importer and trading company, incorporated the entire mining district as the Black Rock Mining Company. From 1950‚Äî1956, Tempiute had a population of 700, and a school. The post Office was opened as Tempiute in February 1953 and closed in October 1957. During its most productive years, the Lincoln mine was one of the nation's primary producers of tungsten. When the price of tungsten declined in 1957, the mill was closed and the town was soon abandoned.

Her first music lessons were in Spanish classical guitar and, before Turner became an accomplished blues artist, she earned an undergraduate degree from Queens College in Elementary Education and Foreign Language, before pursuing graduate studies at New York University, where she studied computer science. She built a career in information technology and worked as both a systems analyst and software engineer. She met her future husband, Benedict Turner, in 1985. Career Turner's musical path to the blues started with a music book she purchased that included photographs of scenery from the American south. The imagery in the book connected her to her family's southern background in the east coast‚Äôs Piedmont region. She says, \\"As I was reading, I was learning about this interesting [blues] music. And once I heard it, I really loved it, and I knew that I wanted to play it.\\" She taught herself for many years by listening to old vinyl records but, as her interest in country blues music grew, she sought out and found teachers such as Jack Baker and John Cephas. and Woody Mann. These mentors assisted Turner in mastering Piedmont style fingerpicking. As her interest in blues grew, so did her husband's curiosity. Benedict is quoted as saying, \\"I am an artist, and I had never played an instrument before I met Valerie. One day, I picked up a washboard in an antique shop and brought it home as joke.\\" Benedict, who comes from Trinidad and Tobago, now plays bones, washboard, and harmonica. A senior art director / graphic designer by trade, he designs his own, elaborate musical washboards, and even has his own line of these unique percussion instruments which he calls \\"Darlington Washboards\\". Benedict taught himself to play bones and studied washboard with both Washboard Chaz from Louisiana, and Newman Taylor Baker who often played with the New York City based Ebony Hillbillies. Benedict is quoted as saying, \\"African Americans didn't always have money for expensive store-bought instruments and, being ingenious, found ways to make music by using common household items like spoons, washtubs, bones, jugs, and washboards. I'm just doing my part to continue this tradition. As the duo 'Piedmont Bl≈´z'; the duo have been featured in many festivals including the Chicago Blues Festival. Internationally, they have performed in Ireland, Germany, Spain, and Israel. Other appearances include Blues in the Gorge in Corbett, Oregon, the Harvest Time Blues Festival in Monaghan, Ireland, Jacob‚Äôs Ladder Festival in Sea of Galilee, Israel, the Tel Aviv Blues Festival in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, Israel, plus the Brooklyn Folk Festival in Brooklyn, New York. Publishing In 2017, Turner authored and edited a book entitled Piedmont Style Country Blues Guitar Basics, designed by Benedict Turner, and published by their company, Mudbone Watson Productions Inc. The easy-to-follow instruction guide contains Piedmont style blues arrangements for country blues guitar with audio files and lyrics for 23 tunes. It is a curriculum, a course in understanding country blues guitar using various keys, tunings, timings, standard notation, tablature, chord charts, and fingerpicking techniques. This book has been acquired by the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. Musical style Her guitar style is influenced by her mentor John Cephas. Turner's guitar playing is said to be in the tradition of Mississippi John Hurt, Etta Baker, and Elizabeth Cotten. Teaching Turner teaches guitar workshops in Piedmont style finger picking, while her husband teaches percussion workshops using washboards and bones. Together, they teach early blues history workshops.

It was designed by Thomas Buckland and McPhee Smith and was built from 1881 to 1934 by Kell & Rigby. It is also known as Buckland Convalescent Home and Garden. The property is owned by The Buckland Convalescent Hospital. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Indigenous history= Reports of numerous bushfires in the Blue Mountains in the 1820s is seen as evidence of Aboriginal presence in the area. Recent studies have revealed evidence of occupation back some 14,000 years. The arrival of Europeans and the introduction of diseases such as smallpox, saw the Aboriginal population decimated as early as 1789 when a widespread epidemic, according to Captain John Hunter (1793) \\"swept off hundreds of the natives in the winter of 1789\\". Apparently quick to assimilate, the Aboriginal group around Springwood 'in 1819 the \\"Chef de Springwood\\" Aurang- Jack...was in European dress and the elderly leader Karadra was smoking a clay pipe'. By the 1991 census only 65 Aboriginal people were recorded living in the area. The clan associated with Springwood was identified as the Oryang-Ora (Aurang), and there are a number of known sites containing Aboriginal evidence in the Springwood area, though none known to the Buckland Village.Archnex, 2002, B3 =Colonial history= Buckland Village chronology: Phase 1 of development covers the period 1876-1934 and is believed to incorporate the following development and landscape features: * farm residence; * outbuilding and paddocks/orchard; * additional six-roomed cottage (the position of this has not been established); * dam (other side of boundary); * water feature; * sandstone-edged pathways; * landscaping, including exotic pines along the northern boundary; * large dam and probably a second dam; * driveway from Hawkesbury Road.Edds, 2003, 2-6 In February 1876 James Bentley Corbin was granted at Springwood - portion 97. In December 1876 John Thomas Ellison was granted - portion 72. In January 1881 Dr. James Norton MLA was granted \\"under the Volunteer Force Regulation Act of 1867\\" - portion 38 - property was named Euchora. Norton was a Member of the NSW Legislative Assembly and Postmaster General in the Stuart Government. He originally received in the late 1870s and purchased a further which were parts of Portions 71 and 137, originally granted to John Thomas Ellison in 1876. Dr Norton erected a cottage on the land in 1884, and named it Euchora. He is reported as being a keen horticulturist and naturalist. His garden around \\"Norton Hall\\" at Leichhardt was extensive and renowned,Stuart Read, pers.comm., 10/1/2014 and it is said that he compiled a list of the native flora of the place, as well as introducing many exotics. A dam was constructed in the lower portion of the land and water was pumped up to a reservoir on Hawkesbury Road from which the extensive gardens were watered. In 1898 lands and portions were partly amalgamated by Norton. He died in 1906.Archnex, 2002, B4 In 1906 the land was sold to John Francis King. In 1910 King sold it to Frederick Henry GriffithBroughton. Broughton built a separate cottage of six rooms to the Hawkesbury Road frontage in 1917. The current parcel of land appears to have been consolidated about this time. Euchora was operated as a guest house for many years by Mrs Breen, who later ran The Ferns guest house (now demolished), opposite Springwood railway station. A site plan of this era showed Euchora (two buildings, a separate cluster of outbuildings towards Haweksbury Road, a tennis court to the east and an orchard to the north- east.Archnex, 2002, B5 In 1934 DP1093214 survey dated 24/3/1934 - land area was , or 32 perches.Archnex, 2002, B2 Buckland Hospital's site is partly occupies the former property of Silva Plana, a landscaped site of and a house built in 1881 as a country retreat by John Frazer, wholesale grocer and merchant (what became \\"John Frazer and Son\\" from 1847 in Sydney), who from 1874-84 was a member of the NSW Legislative Assembly and a philanthropist. Two fine fountains, one in Hyde Park South, the other between the Land Titles Office and St. Mary's Cathedral in Sydney are memorials to his generosity. The University of Sydney, where he hoped to fund the chair of History, awards a Frazer scholarship in history, and he was a founding Councillor on the Presbyterian foundation, St. Andrew's College and donor of funds to the Presbyterian ministry studying there.Maddock, 5-15; ADB IV, 218-9 Sir Henry Parkes' son Varney designed Silva Plana.Searle and Morony, 6, 32: Robinson, map of Springwood, c.1910 The Frazer Memorial Church (opened 1895) in Springwood is a striking example of his (and broader) Victorian philanthropy, financed entirely from his and his widow, Elizabeth's generosity. Frazer died in 1884. Mrs Frazer sent her gardener from Silva Plana to lay out the grounds and plant the trees around this church, the first in Springwood of any denomination.Maddock, John, The Frazer Memorial Church - a History, 1995, Springwood Historical Society, quoted in Leary, 2013, 6-8 In March 1934 Sir Thomas Buckland, miner, pastoralist, businessman (mining investor, company chairman and president of the Bank of NSW) and philanthropist discussed a proposal with the NSW Government to purchase land and establish a hospital, furnish and endow it, on the proviso that the State would upgrade Springwood's water supply. In May 1934 a Deed of Trust between Buckland Esq. and Trustees: Thomas Buckland; Rt. Rev. Sydney James Kirkby, Bishop Coadjutor of the Diocese of Sydney; Dr. C. K. Hogg, inspector-general of mental hospitals in NSW: R. W. GIllespie, merchant; A. J. Taylor, solicitor; and David Roxburgh, solicitor - was signed to establish \\"The Buckland Hospital\\". =Buckland Convalescent Hospital= The Trust Deed Thomas Buckland purchased Euchora in 1934, and the Buckland Hospital Trust was established by a trust deed, registered on 20 August 1934. The deed states, inter-alia: The trust fund was also to be put to the provision of 25 beds and also \\"... for the medical nursing and domestic staff necessary for the conduct of such Hospital which shall be erected according to plans and specifications approved by the Trustees.\\" The Hospital Building The design for the hospital was prepared by Buckland and McPhee Smith, architects. One of Thomas Buckland's sons, Harold Buckland was a principal of that firm. The contract for the erection of the hospital was let to Kell & Rigby, builders for A¬£28,500 in May 1935. One of the conditions of Buckland's gift was that the State Government should install a permanent water supply to the town of Springwood, including the hospital. This was completed, including a reinforced concrete tank holding , reticulation to the hospital and other lower Blue Mountains villages, in 1935.Archnex, 2002, C6 The early years The first matron of the BCH was Matron Rothery, whose diaries from the beginning of 1936, up until 1940 were examined in detail to try and gain some insight into the establishment and operation of the hospital during its early years. In \\"Memoranda from 1935\\", Matron Rothery notes that on 15 November, she and Sister Heard visited Springwood, where Mr Taylor met them at the train, and they had dinner at his house. They inspected the Buckland Hospital later. During the course of November and December, various items of hardware, kitchenware and other equipment of the Hospital was purchased from Anthony Hordens in Sydney. On 23 December 1935, Matron Rothery and Sister Heard took up residence at the Hospital, and there are entries pertaining to the organisation of monogrammed bed linen and other paraphernalia needed for the function of the Hospital during December. Sir Thomas Buckland is noted as visiting first on Friday 3 January 1936 staying the night and leaving the next morning. Miss Beatrice Buckland, the Hospital's first patient was admitted on Wednesday 3 February, and was brought to the Hospital by Mr Harold Buckland. The ongoing entries for the period detail the employment of staff, staff movements and illnesses, planting of shrubs and plants from \\"Rosens\\", the weather, accounts, purchase of hardware, works being undertaken around the place, minor building maintenance and rectification and all the minutiae of getting the Hospital up and running. The official opening is entered at Saturday 25 January 1936: Sir Thomas and Lady Buckland took a keen and active interest in the formative period of the Hospital, and Sir Thomas was involved in details such as the selection of the linoleum for the hallways. He visited on a regular basis for both practical, administrative purposes and to visit his daughter. During 1936, he visited or corresponded on some 50 occasions, in 1937, 25 and by 1938, 45. By this time, Sir Thomas was 90 years old, and was still driving up from Hunters Hill to Springwood'. Sir Thomas died on 11 June 1947, two weeks prior to his 99th birthday at his residence, Lyndhurst in Hunters Hill. His estate was valued at ¬£589,958: after ¬£40,000 bequests to each surviving child (2 sons, 3 daughters), legacies of ¬£24,000 to other family members and some ¬£11,000 to sundry schools and hospitals, he left 2/3 of the residue to the Buckland Convalescent Hospital, Springwood and the income of 1/3 to the Church of England homes for children.Archnex, 2002, B7 The second phase is believed to represent the development of the property during the 1934-1983 period and incorporates the following development and landscape features: * the hospital; * caretaker's cottage; * tennis court (from phase 1 - converted to a croquet court); * dairy; * paddocks and chook shed; * formalising the driveway from Hawkesbury Road; * landscaping; * fibro cottage; * kitchen garden and flower garden; * 1946 renovations - probably the sun room and verandah infills (2 storey section); * fire stairs installed.Edds, 2003, 2-13 Buckland Village In 1971, the Directors of the BCH were compelled to sell five residential blocks fronting Patterson Road in order to supplement income. In 1973, it was decided to sell a further 79 acres to Leighton Properties for a housing development, but the sale fell through because Blue Mountains City Council would not agree to re-zoning the land for residential purposes. At the end of 1973, the directors resolved to offer the whole of the property to the Church of England Retirement Villages at a peppercorn rent, and also indicated that they would be prepared to supplement costs via a contribution from the investment income of the BCH. This proposal also fell through as the then NSW Crown Solicitor opposed the scheme. A similar approach had also been made to NSW Legacy, but failed for the same reason. In 1977, it was decided to reorganise the operation of the BCH, as it had shown an operating loss of $123,516 for 1976/77. The company had not shown an operating profit since 1969. It was decided that the then chairman, Mr T B (Basil) Silk, MBE, be asked to vacate the chair and take up the position of General Manager, effective 1 June 1977. During the subsequent financial year, the deficit was reduced to $53,116. The Board decided that further action was needed and sought to put the greatest asset of the BCH, the land, to better use. It was decided that the use of the place as a retirement village should be explored. Discussions were had with the Crown Solicitors, and the NSW Attorney General, Frank Walker, who indicated support for the proposal. legal opinion was sought over the ensuing period and an action commenced in the courts to alter the terms of the trust deed. Basil Silk, Director of the BCH filed an affidavit in the hearing before the Supreme Court of New South Wales (N 1547 of 1982) in which the need for the alteration to the Trust Deed was dealt with in some detail. He cited an \\"Inquiry into Health Services for the Psychiatrically Ill and Developmentally Disabled\\" (The Richmond Report), published by the New South Wales Health Commission in March 1983. This outlined the need for expanding need of care for the aged, and in particular, those suffering from dementia. The major problems highlighted included: * Inadequate and inappropriate accommodation: * Lack of skilled staff trained in assessing and treating the psychiatric disorders of old age; * Lack if support services for families who are the major \\"therapists\\" for demented people; * Lack of services such as laundry, home help, handy man, temporary care facilities, etc. the provision of which could obviate inappropriate nursing home placement; * Lack of other community services which would assist in reducing social isolation. As can be seen, the curtilage defined appears to relate, in part, to the \\"prospect\\" from the BCH building itself, to the east, and encompasses the area back to Hawkesbury Road which includes the access road. Apart from the inclusion of these elements of the original layout, the remainder of the area identified would appear to be largely arbitrary. There has also been considerable development, either partially or fully, within this curtilage since the PCO was created in 1985. Phase 3 - 1984-2003 - Buckland Village - with approval of the alteration of the Trust to provide \\"three tiered facilities\\" in 1983 and classification of the site as \\"Special Purpose Hospital\\" a period of rapid expansion followed. Between 1983 and 1992 a number of scattered new (two-three storey) accommodation buildings were added broadly \\"around\\" the existing front drive, western, southern, northern and eastern parts of the main complex. A large curving 'wing marking an arc to the north-east of the axis of the main hospital complex was also added in this period. The tennis court was altered to form a croquet lawn, the sun room additions and fire stairs were all installed by this time. The paddock photos reveal the extent of clearing including removal of some former pine trees associated with \\"Euchora\\" era development. Since 1984 additional buildings and improvements have been made in keeping with the requirements of the Public Hospitals Act 1929. These additional buildings and associated landscaping such as road access and plantings have occurred in a number of stages as noted below and illustrated in figure 2.7 - Phase 3 of development.Edds, 2003, 2-15 ;First stage: * Demolition of fibro cottage and large chook shed; * development of isolated self-care units in blocks of four, and one of six units; * one block of 16 studio units (bed-sitters); * one block of 24 studio units (bed sitters); * one expanse of 40 hostel units; * two dual-occupancy units; * dairy converted to a small community centre; * landscaping and paddocks. ;Second stage; * 14 three bedroom cottages; * multi-purpose community centre; * hostel community centre and link to 24 studio units (which were converted to hostel unit use); * flat roofed carports for some self-care units.Edds, 2003, 2-16 Between 1992 and 2002 two further \\"clusters\\" of detached accommodation buildings were added in the far east and south-east extent of the cleared part of the property, below the rest of the complex. A further three buildings were added to the \\"arc\\" noted above (1983‚Äì92), and to the south of the oval perimeter drive around the complex. Further development As outlined above, at the chronology, it is intended to build a 62 Bed Nursing Home, essentially to replace the high care accommodation contained in the Buckland Convalescent Hospital and an ancillary 40 bed Nursing Home, run by Buckland Convalescent Hospital at Wentworth Falls. A number of alternative designs have been prepared by Simmat & Associates Architects Pty Ltd over the intervening period, some of which are included at Appendix A. There is currently a development application before the Blue Mountains City Council proposing such a development.Archnex, 2002, B8 - B12  Description  ;Landscape Setting: The \\"Building\\" article of July 12, 1935 (vol.56, no.335) - the second of two consecutive editions devoted to hospitals and similar institutions being built at that time) describing this hospital included: One of the hospital's greatest assets was and is its location. The fact that it was away from the rush and bustle of the city, located in a very tranquil, stress-free location, the fresh, clean air and ability to provide good, substantial food was seen as very conducive to achieving well-being. The site consists of approx. and has an easterly view towards the city of Sydney. \\"On clear days the city and harbour bridge can be discerned easily on the horizon\\". In addition to the aspect the site is also situated beneath the main ridge and protected from the westerly winds. The architects, Buckland & McPhee Smith adopted '...the U-shaped plan with the wings facing east and having the main entrance face on the west. The kitchen and service block has been placed on the central axis on the opposite side of the building to the courtyard, being connected to the main block by a series of massive stone elliptical arches, that in addition to performing this practical purpose, provide an attractive entrance feature.Building, 1935, 71 It would appear that the primary orientation was towards the views to Sydney in the distant east, and that there is little evidence of an attempt to maximise solar access. The current view is generally obscured by trees.Archnex, 2002, C15 Although alluded to in the \\"Building\\" article, where it states: \\"It is the intenteion of the architects to concentrate upon the layout of the grounds in which scheme the treatment of the main courtyard will play an important part\\", there is no direct evidence of a landscape \\"design\\" as such.Archnex, 2002, C16 The courtyard is a relatively formal axial arrangement in which a fountain and flagpole has been placed as a centrepiece and a path and surround directs the view towards the city in the distance. It woul dappear that the courtyard was intended to frame the view out of the hospital, rather than being a conscious part of its \\"setting\\", although it did function in that role, to some extent, in views from the croquet lawn. The fountain appears tob e in very original condition (complete with frogs, which were recently replenished). Beyond the fountain is the croquet lawns, which survive and are still used by residents.Archnex, 2002, C17 The courtyard planting appears to have changed over the years, with palms (Chusan/Chinese windmill palm (Trachycarpus fortunei) and Argentine jelly palm: Butia capitata - which is unusual-rare are apparent in old photographs)Stuart Read, pers.comm., 15/3/2013 being apparent in the earlier photographs. Matron Rothery's diaries quite fastidiously note the plants which were purchased from time to time, including shrubs, vegetable seeds etc. Much of the planting appears to have been an accumulation of popular ornamentals and exotics of the time, and the vegetable garden was located to the north of buildings where there was good sunlight. The courtyard's central path is flanked by pairs of dwarf golden conifers, Japanese sacred bamboo (Nandina domestica \\"Pygmaea\\", with other shrubs planted around its perimeter against the building wings.Stuart Read, 15/3/2013 from 2002 photographs Some notion of the type of planting originally used is available in photographs, which appear to be from the 1930s period, reproduced in Appendix B.Archnex, 2002, C18 The southern side appears to have a cut-flower garden (at least early in the hospital operations). An undated, probably 1950s aerial photograph, shows the vegetable garden, cottage and dairy to the north, west and south of the hospital \\"U\\" shape (facing east). Outbuildings to the east of the cottage may date from the \\"Euchora\\" period. As outlined in the \\"Building\\" article of 1935, there was an intention of making the hospital more or less self-sufficient in terms of produce - or at least able to supplement bought produce with fresh. There was a dairy, fowl run, and an ongoing vegetable and cut-flower gardening, preserve and jam-making. There are a number of entries in Matron's diaries as to the making of jams, particularly. The hospital was active in the local show scene, exhibiting flowers, particularly, and winning numerous awards. The south western grounds grazed dairy cows. The dairy was located to the south (now a community centre), near the main entry. It is of similar materials to the main building and very much in simple, vernacular style, with a Marseilles tile roof and similar joinery to the hospital proper. There is some evidence in the diaries that it may have been built to house Beatrice Buckland, although one would expect it more likely to have been the manager's cottage or somesuch.Archnex, 2002, C19 ;The Water Supply It may be remembered that one of the conditions made by Sir Thomas Buckland when he made his munificent gift was that the State Government should install a permanent water supply to the town of Springwood, which, of course, includes the hospital. This system is now almost complete, the storage reservoir having been constructed on the heights of Faulconbridge. This massive reinforced concrete tank has a capacity of 500,000 gallons and reticulation to the hospital and the other lower Mountain towns, which will benefit greatly by this much-needed improvement, is now almost complete (1935). It was noted that the quantity surveyors, Thompson & Wark, provided their services in an honorary capacity, and that the BCH was one of few such institutions that did not rely on Government support. It is certainly very gratifying to see a public-spirited citizen...endowing an institution to do useful work for the community which will support itself in perpetuity. Such practical munificence deserves the hearty applause of all. ;Patients' Bedrooms From the entrance vestibule, which may be described as the hub of the whole building, corridors run to the end of the main buildings and then at right angles through the wings. Patients' bedrooms, twenty-four in number, one to each patient, are located in these wings. In the design and equipment of these rooms it was necessary for the architect to continually bear in mind the purpose for which they were constructed. Thus we find the light fittings countersunk in the ceiling so as to be well out of the way of any abuse that they might receive at the hands of an over-wrought patient. The taps on the hand-basins are of the patent spring- catch variety, which have to be held the whole time that water is desired, so that there will be no danger of patients leaving the water on to overflow and cause damage. Provision has also been made for a stop-cock under the floor of each room so that the water supply can be eliminated if the mental condition of the patient so requires. ;The Equipment feature of the equipment of the bedrooms is the built-in loughboy [sic] and chest-of-drawers, while the adjustable mirror situated in the open space is particularly neat and well thought out. The top of the chest-of-drawers is covered by plate glass in a stainless steel surround. The whole of the doors to the bedrooms are of Beale's solid core Queensland walnut flush panel variety. The portions of the walls behind the basins are tiled and fitted with toothbrush and tumbler holders and towel rails. Each room is also fitted with patient's call and light indicator to attract the attention of the nurse on duty. A feature of each bedroom is the colour scheme, the walls being blended in numerous light pastel shades with the joinery and furniture in a contrasting colour of bright enamel. Two rooms for special cases and a sick bay are also included in the scheme. Both wings terminate in a pavilion which provides additional veranda accommodation. Box and linen rooms provide adequate storage space, access from outside being available by a service entrance, thus obviating the necessity for delivery of linen and patients' trunks through the main vestibule. The two main lavatory blocks take up portion of each side of the main block and are particularly interesting in that they are fitted up to meet the special demands of the institution. None of the baths have any taps adjacent to them, hot and cold water to all being remote-controlled by the nurse on duty, a special thermostatic mixer being provided, while all taps are of the key- controlled asylum type. ;First Floor The first floor of the main building accommodates the staff, the largest unit being the Matron's flat, which comprises living room, bedroom, bathroom and entrance hall, double doors from the living room providing access to the flat roof over the porte cochere. In addition there are seven nurses' bedrooms and four domestic staff bedrooms, all of which are supplied with hot water. The staff and nurses' common rooms, equipped with fireplaces and bookcases are roomy and comfortable. The service and dining room block, which as already described, is connected with the main building by means of the arched porte cochere, contains the main patients' Dining Room, which is a delightfully proportioned room with a large fireplace centrally situated on the long wall flanked by two large windows on either side. The ceiling is heavily beamed. The staff dining room is adjacent, and both are conveniently situated for service from the kitchen. ;Kitchen and Service The kitchen and scullery are specially equipped with stainless steel sinks and tables, adequate cupboards and cooking equipment which includes a fuel range, steam-heated Bain Marie and serving table, steam tea urn, steam heated towel rack and other equipment. The whole of the visible pipes, taps, etc. are chromium plated, while all the woodwork is enamelled and the backs of all cupboards and the walls are all tiled to facilitate cleaning. Storeroom equipment includes plenty of shelving, special vegetable containers with movable wire shelves, refrigerator cabinet and compressor unit. Much of the kitchen equipment, one notes, has been supplied by Metters. The boiler room is fitted with a low pressure steam boiler for hot water and steam for the building: special hoppers in convenient positions have been constructed for the storage of fuel. The fuel supply to the kitchen has been so arranged by means of an iron door in the main fuel bin that coke can be discharged direct for the range. A feature of the laundry, and on which will undoubtedly prove a great boon in the winter, is the steam drying cabinet, that is capable of dealing with all the washing from the whole if the inmates. ;The Exterior In the treatment of the exterior, the architects have derived their inspiration from the Georgian period of design. They have certainly been wise in their choice, for the building of this institutional character must, of necessity, be somewhat large and comprise lengthy facades and wide roof areas. Consequently the simplicity of detail and reliance upon good proportioning that is the charm of this style, makes it particularly adaptable to this type of work. While dignified in appearance, it retains that air of homeliness and comfort which is so essential for the building of this type. It was realised that it was of importance for the welfare and recovery of the patients that the building and its surroundings should be as bright and cheerful as possible, consequently the brick work is of a warm red colour, relieved with slightly darker bricks as a base course and in the quoins' heads and sills. The roofing tiles, supplied by W. Wilson Ltd. are also rich in colour and pleasant to look upon, which is important for the roof areas are extensive. As a central crowning feature to the main roof a small copper fleche surmounted by a cast bronze weathercock has been incorporated in the design. The entrance features, as already mentioned, takes the form of an arcade and it is pleasing in these days of synthetic materials to see that good solid sandstone has been selected for the purpose. The simple but massively executed ironwork which forms the balustrading between the arches goes well with the stonework in its sincerity and robustness. As outlined in the \\"Building\\" account, the exterior is generally in face brick, and a glazed Marseilles tiled roof. The design is a very sober, \\"Georgian\\"/Colonial revival influenced one, and is more or less rigorously symmetrical in terms of composition, although there are minor departures from this. Some of the brickwork detailing is quite subtle, with the soldier course to the window heads, sills and quoining picked out in a darker, \\"liver\\" brick. The bricks generally are dry-pressed, in a mid-range red, with some darker bricks. The external ventilators are in glazed terra cotta, while the eaves are in tongue and grooved boarding, painted in an eau- de-nil to further perpetuate the \\"colonial revival\\" theme. The windows are painted white to contrast with the brickwork, and are six-pane sashes generally, although four pane sashes are used to some of the smaller windows.

It is also of heritage value by virtue of its design as a seemingly seminal example of a totally \\"private\\" roomed establishment, and for its adaptation of the \\"Georgian\\"/Colonial Revival style to institutional buildings. It has historically been closely associated with the community of Blue Mountains town of Springwood, and now forms the centrepiece of Buckland Village, an aged care facility and community of some 420 people.Archnex, 2002, D4 Buckland Convalescent Home was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Buckland Convalescent Hospital demonstrates the establishment of a mental health care facility in the Blue Mountains region that was specifically addressed to the care of female patients.Archnex, 2002, D1 The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Buckland Convalescent Hospital is inextricably and eponymously associated with Sir Thomas Buckland who established and endowed the Hospital. Sir Thomas was a notable pastoralist, mining executive, businessman, philanthropist and chairman of Pitt Son and Badgery, the Bank of New South Wales (1922-1937), the United Insurance Co. Ltd and director of the Permanent Trustee Co. of NSW (from 1935). He took a vital interest in the place. It was designed by a firm of architects of which his son, Harold Buckland was a principal, and his daughter, Beatrice was the first patient. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Buckland Convalescent Hospital demonstrates the adoption of an historical antecedent style to the design of an institutional health building during the \\"interwar\\" period. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Buckland Convalescent Hospital has had a long association with the local community of Springwood, and has been active in community affairs since its inception in the latter part of the 1930s.Archnex, 2002, D2. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

Stewart but also William A. Stewart, William Stewart or Will Stewart (17 July 1882 - 18 January 1953) was an artist and craftsman who reconstructed, from pieces thousands of years old, furniture found in the tomb of Queen Hetepheres near the Giza Pyramids. He was also an accomplished artist whose works were displayed at the Calton Gallery (Edinburgh, Scotland) in 1986, the Bradford Art Galleries (Cartwright Hall, Bradford, West Yorkshire, England) in 1989, and at the Royal Academy of Arts (London). He made great practical contributions to the light industries of Palestine before and during the Second World War.Bradford Art Galleries and Museums 1989. Gallery/Show brochure: \\"W. A.

Paintings and drawings of Egypt, Palestine, Jordan, France, Italy and Britain, from the studio of W. A. Stewart\\". . Relevant parts of the brochure are reproduced with the gallery's authorization here. Early life and study Will Stewart was born on July 17, 1882, in Ilkley, England the son of John Reich Stewart and Naamah (Arnold) Stewart. One of 5 children (2 brothers and 2 sisters), he attended the local school, then Bradford Technical College, then the Royal College of Art where he studied under Augustus John. He worked in the design department of Listers at Manningham Mills. He was a founder of the Loft Arts Club in 1902, which changed its name in 1912 to the Bradford Arts Club, and which encouraged poetry, literature, music, life drawings and other arts. During this time he was introduced to several influential people including Arnold Priestman, Ernest Sichel, William Shackleton, William Rothenstein, Edward Wadsworth, and Father O'Connor (GK Chesterton's 'Father Brown'), and he became good friends with artist James Arundel. He met the Indian poet and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore and created a pastel portrait that was exhibited in 1909. Work in Egypt and Palestine Will Stewart emigrated to the Middle East in 1911, to become an Inspector of Arts and Crafts in the Egyptian Ministry of Education. There he set up the Cairo School of Arts and Crafts, becoming its first principal. He was positively influenced by Arab, Turkish, Syrian and Byzantine art. Many students of the Cairo School of Arts and Crafts became accomplished artists. Some made fine jewelry to Stewart's designs including copies of ornaments worn by the ancient Pharaohs. At the end of World War I, Stewart temporarily moved to Palestine to advise on the re-establishment of crafts and small industries damaged during the war. He worked with C.R. Ashbee, an architect and fine arts expert. Ashbee's wife Janet and 4 daughters, along with Janet's cousin Kathleen Beardshaw, moved from the UK to Palestine at this time. Will married Kathleen a year later in Cairo. In 1927 the tomb of Queen Hetapheres, the Mother of Cheops who built the Great Pyramid, was discovered at Giza. Stewart was recruited by Professor Reisner of the Boston-Harvard expedition to make a painting of the interior of the tomb before anything was touched. Stewart was then asked to reconstruct the furniture in the tomb that had disintegrated. This included the Queen's throne, bed, chair, footstool, and neck rest that had been covered in fine gold leaf. Stewart discovered that the furniture was constructed using mortise and tenon joints. After nearly three years of work (mostly in a tent in the Giza desert, with one assistant), the pieces were displayed at the Cairo Museum. The many sketches, papers and notes made by Stewart on this project were discovered in a shed in Perthshire when his eldest daughter died in 1981. These were given to the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. According to his daughter Anne, \\"The furniture in the tomb was all intricately carved, then overlaid with gold. The wood had gone to dust, leaving the gold leaf gently collapsed. So he had to create new woodwork (knowing the traditional shapes from pictures in other tombs), then creating a sort of porridge-like mixture to cover it and lay the gold leaf on it somehow to make it all stand up as in the original carving.\\"Anne Stewart- personal communication, Dec 6, 2018 After his work at the Cairo School of Arts and Crafts, in 1930 Will Stewart accepted a new post under the High Commissioner of Palestine as Supervisor of Technical Education. Along with his wife and 3 children he moved from Cairo to Jerusalem. The Governor of Sinai asked Stewart to take the journey via a new road that was just completed through the Sinai Desert and through Mitla Pass, and to write an article about the experience for the Egyptian press (The Sphynx magazine). His wife was the first woman to drive through Sinai. Will Stewart recognized the special crafts that were part of the Palestine agricultural economy, such as wool products, copper cooking pans, pottery, goat-hair ropes, and reed mats. He created courses for teachers to include weaving, pottery, drawing, and woodwork. He set up a costume museum for display of the fine traditional clothing, which was fast disappearing in favor of modern clothes. He encouraged the skills of traditional garment makers, which were declining. He befriended musicians and was largely responsible for the formation of the Palestine Conservatory of Music, for which he was named the first Chairman in 1933. The music students gave many concerts including performances at the Government House of the High Commissioner. Stewart was also involved with the reorganization of the Bezalel School of Art in Jerusalem. During WW2, government priorities changed and Will Stewart was Controller of Light Industries. This work was focused on ensuring that the country produced as many of its own essentials as possible. After the war, Stewart was deeply saddened by the Arab-Jewish rift because he knew that each community had skills and ideas that could interest and benefit the other. He hated to see his work in this field move backward. Stewart worked with town planner C.R. Ashbee on the restoration of Jerusalem after the war, in 1918. Painting Stewart was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1916. Works of Stewart including paintings and drawings of Egypt, Palestine, Jordan, France, Italy and Britain, were shown at the Edinburgh Festival 1986 at the Calton Gallery in Edinburgh. Among the works shown were \\"Boatman, Damietta, Cairo,\\" 1927 oil on canvas; \\"Fountain Court, Jaffa,\\" 1947 oil on canvas; and \\"Feast of the Nebi Musa (Shrine of Moses), Jerico,\\" 1933 Gouache. \\"Feast of the Nebi Musa\\" was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1938, No. 882. His works include scenes of life in Egypt, Palestine, and Jordan between 1914 and 1947, as well as paintings created during expeditions to Italy, Spain, Cyprus, England, Scotland, and France from 1907 until 1953. One of his paintings, \\"Men of the Trees in Palestine,\\" was included in the \\"Palestine Poster Project Archives.\\" /> In 1948, Will Stewart retired to High Wycombe where he concentrated on his painting. He renewed his association with the Bradford Arts Club and was an art critic for The Yorkshire Herald. He had started to exhibit at Bradford's Cartwright Hall as early as 1906, both with the Arts Club and in his own right in The Bradford Spring Exhibition, a selected annual exhibition which showed the best of mainstream contemporary art. The titles of his pictures chart his move from typical Yorkshire subjects to the people and architecture of Palestine, along with the high-keyed oils and watercolors of his European trips. He effortlessly moved from portraiture to landscape, still life, and townscapes. Will Stewart continued painting until his death at High Wycombe in 1953. Life impact An obituary was written by Keith Roach, a District Commissioner in Palestine, which included: \\"To the glassmakers of Hebron he introduced better methods of firing; to the weavers of Majdal he showed how their work could be improved by better looms; to the potters of Gaza and Ramallah he suggested fresh designs, and by himself turning out new types on the wheel, increased their sales. The workmen were astonished at his knowledge and skill, and admitted that he knew more of their craft than they did themselves. His colloquial Arabic, which never quite lost its Yorkshire burr, was readily understood, and with teachers and workmen alike he never failed to show patience and courtesy. It is small wonder that respect and admiration quickly developed into friendship and affection...\\" Will Stewart's daughters Jean and Anne, and his granddaughter Niki Stewart, have followed in his footsteps as artists.

Within a few months, Tenabo had a population of 1000, a hotel, restaurant, school, saloons and brothels. The scarcity of water was always a challenge for the mining community, and needed to be hauled from springs miles away. From 1907‚Äî1910, multiple productive mines kept a mill running, but after 1911, mining operations started to decline. The post office opened in December 1906 and closed July in 1912.

Fallon is located about 35 miles southwest of Bismarck, North Dakota, roughly 8 miles northeast of Flasher, North Dakota, on the former Mandan-Black (also known as the Bismarck-Deadwood) Hills stage trail. Another town located along this line is Saint Anthony Crossing, located about 4 miles northwest of Saint Anthony, North Dakota. The settlement started to develop in the late 1890s, and a post office was opened April 2, 1900 with James A. Fallon, a native of Ireland, as Postmaster, whom is also most likely the towns namesake. In 1909 it was relocated to the northeast with H. S. Freiz as Postmaster. The peak population was only about 10 people, due to the towns inland location away from an operational railroad or highway, thus very little development ever occurred. The post office closed November 15, 1914 with mail to Flasher. Since then, the town has withered considerably. There was once a store, St. Peter and Paul Catholic Church, and a Catholic Boarding School on site, and although they were torn down decades ago, multiple scattered foundations can still be found. Today, there are currently two buildings left at the site, a community center or possibly town/dance hall, and a house, formerly the church Parish, which appears to have been last occupied in 2008.

History  =Foundations of modern astronomy= Astronomy, it can be argued, is the oldest science in the world and practised by many of the ancient cultures. In ancient times astronomical practise involved the observation of the skies with the naked eye, noting the changes in and movement of the sun, stars and planets using this information to plot ritual or agricultural calendars. Some of the earliest recorded astronomical observations were made by the Chinese which date from the 6th century BC. One of these observations note the regular eclipses of the moon which were explained as the moon being attacked by a hungry dragon. People diligently made as much noise as possible so the dragon would flee. Western astronomy has its genesis in the kingdoms of Sumer and Assyria where priests used observation of the heavens for purposes of divination. Based in these practises Babylonia is credited with the development of a more sophisticated observation of the skies and detecting the periodic nature of astronomical activity that is able to be predicted through mathematics. The work of the Babylonian astronomers was the basis for Greek, Indian, Sassanian, Byzantine, Islamic, Central Asian and western European astrology. In the 4th century BC Greek astronomers were the first to develop a three dimensional model to describe the motion of the planets around the earth. Later, a slowly developing debate regarding the earth verses the sun as the centre of this movement grew, culminating in the work of Copernicus who posited a mathematically supported system where the planets revolved around the sun. His work was later expanded by Galileo and Kepler. Up until the 17th century, astronomy was positional and depended on observations of the naked eye. In the early 17th century a new instrument, the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey and quickly taken up and improved upon by Galileo Galilei. In 1610, armed with his 20 XX refractor telescope, Galileo discovered four moons of Jupiter and for the first time in the history of the world observed the movement of a satellite around a planet. Using his telescope Galileo also observed that the phases of Venus were similar to lunar phases and argued that these observations empirically supported the theory that the earth moves around the sun. James Kepler a contemporary of Galileo's supported Galileo's observations. He was the first to attempt to derive mathematical predictions of celestial motions from assumed physical cases. Years of his research culminated in the publication of his \\"Epitome of Copernican Astronomy\\" in 1615 in which his three laws of planetary motion were outlined, theorising a heliocentric planetary system. By 1687 the marriage of physics and astronomy reached its epitome as Isaac Newton realised that the same force which attracted objects to the earth also fixed the moon in orbit around the earth and posited the law of universal gravitation.Pannekoek. 1961. =Astronomy in Australia= More than 40,0000 years ago the indigenous people in Australia first observed the southern skies and developed a series of complex cosmic mythologies around the regular movement and appearance of stars, planets, the moon and sun. While different Aboriginal communities developed their own stories and explanations, there were shared threads between these cosmologies. Many groups engendered the sun as a woman warming the land. The moon was male, once young and slim (the waxing crescent moon) he grows fat and lazy as the full moon develops night after night. After breaking the law he is killed by his people (the new moon) and after being dead 3 days he rises to repeat the cycle. Other Aboriginal people such as the Kuwema people of the Northern Territory believe the moon grew fat by eating the spirits of those who disobey tribal laws. Aboriginal people in different areas used the sky as a calendar which indicated the time to move to a new location and food supply. For instance the Boorong people of Victoria knew that when the \\"Mallee-fowl\\" constellation (Lyra) disappears in October, to \\"sit with the sun\\", it was time to start gathering her eggs on Earth. Others used the first appearance of Orion in the sky to mark the time that Dingo puppies were about to be born. Johnson, 1998 =European astronomy in NSW= In 1768 Cook set sail from Plymouth in England. His destination was Tahiti where he, the accompanying astronomer, two artists and two naturalists were to observe and document the 1769 transit of Venus across the sun. Observation and documentation of the transit was to provide an accurate measurement of the distance between the earth and the sun. The southern ocean in 1769 was known to be the best place to take such a measurement. On his return journey, Cook \\"discovered\\" the east coast of Australia which he mapped on this journey home. In 1788 the First Fleet, arrived at Botany Bay and then moved on to settle on the shores of Sydney Cove. With the fleet was a young Lieutenant William Dawes, who had had a deep interest in astronomy. Dawes was charged with the task of setting up the first observatory in the colony and carried all the requisite equipment to do this on the long voyage to the colony. He was to observe the predicted return of Haley's comet in 1789. Dawes pitched his \\"tent-observatory\\" on a rocky, heavily wooded ridge on the west side of Sydney Cove, a kilometre away from the first settlement. The area was later named Dawes Point. A plaque placed on the south pylon of the Sydney Harbour Bridge commemorates Dawes observatory. Despite his attention to the night skies, Dawes did not observe the comet. In late 1821 Governor Brisbane ordered the establishment of an observatory at Parramatta from where he, with the help of two assistants, began the process of mapping the southern skies. Brisbane equipped the observatory with the finest instruments available at the time and installed a scientific library in the building. This facility was operational up until 1847 and the published findings from this observatory marked Australia's first significant contribution to international astronomy. The site of this observatory is listed on the NSW State Heritage Register. In 1858 under the supervision of the Colonial Astronomer of NSW, Rev. William Scot, the construction of the Sydney Observatory at the Rocks was commenced, It was completed in 1859 although the first observations were recorded in 1858. The observatory included a central time-ball tower, a dome to accommodate an equatorial telescope and a transit room for meridian instruments. This was the first government funded observatory established in Australia with others established in Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth by the close of the 19th century. Like the Parramatta observatory site the Sydney Observatory is listed on the NSW State Heritage Register to commemorate its heritage values. During the second half of the 19th century the nation's first astronomical groups and societies were established and a strong community of amateur astronomers and telescope makers emerged. The amateur practitioners funded their own facilities and made an enormous contribution to astronomy in Australia. John Tebutt was one of the most significant of these amateur astronomers. Inspired to pursue astronomy by his observation of the spectacular Donati's comet in 1858, Tebutt became internationally acclaimed in 1861 when he became the first person in the world to discover the \\"Great Comet\\".Comet Tebbutt II 1861 Tebutt established an observatory at Windsor in 1864 and continued to make important observations in the southern skies \\"including lunar occultation of stars, eclipses and shadow transits of the satellites of Jupiter, the position of minor planets and double and variable stars\\". Once again this pioneering observatory, \\"Peninsular House\\" is listed on the State Heritage Register.Haynes, et al 1996p 118. Ken Beames who designed and constructed the Observatory complex at Linden was part of this strong tradition of amateur astronomy of the late 19th and early 20th century. As historian of astronomy in Australia Wayne Orchiston points out the amateur cohort of astronomers fall into 3 categories:\\"apprentices, journeymen and masters. Apprentices are just beginning their astronomical careers, while masters are those acknowledged experts who are able to communicate effectively with professional astronomers in their own chosen fields of expertise. Kenneth Beams was very definitely a master\\".Orchiston, 1989. Unlike most other amateur astronomers Beames' field of interest was in the design and construction of telescopes and optical instruments rather than the observation of the night skies. In fact during the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s Beams was one of the few if not the only amateur or professional astronomers making telescopes and other optical instruments for astronomy in NSW. In a newspaper article from 1970 Beames noted that he had made in excess of 450 telescopes ranging from 6 inch to 24 inch instruments.Holland 2008. This is unusual during the mid decades of the twentieth century when most astronomical instruments were imported from Britain, Europe or America.Orchiston, 2009 Although not a professional astronomer, Beames' work making telescopes and other instruments has been praised by both amateur and professional astronomers as masterpieces of craftsmanship and engineering which have contributed to the development of the field in NSW and Australia. The 24 inch reflector telescope Beames completed in 1939 was the largest amateur or professionally constructed reflector telescope in NSW and retained this status until the 40 inch and 24 inch telescopes were constructed and installed at the Siding Spring Observatory in the mid 1960s. The only other amateur built telescope to rival Beames was that built by Captain Baker in 1868 for the Ballarat Observatory and the only professional telescope that was larger than Beames 24 inch telescope was the 30 inch Reynolds Reflector telescope at Mr Stromlo. The Beames 24 inch telescope was also unique as one of the first large telescopes in Australia to incorporate electric motor drives to operate the telescope and dome. Beames designed and engineered other optical instruments for astronomical uses by amateur and professional organisations in NSW. One example of such an instrument is the blink comparator commissioned by Father O'Leary of the Riverview College Observatory which was completed in 1939. This instrument is still held in the Riverview Observatory Collection and is likely to be the first blink comparator designed and engineered in Australia. After World War II these instruments became commonplace.Orchiston 2009 =Kenneth Beames= Kenneth Beames was born in Gilgandra in 1899. His first job was at the Gligandra Post Office where as a telegram boy he learned morse code and soon moved on to becoming a telegraph operator and postal officer. He also learned semaphore. During World War I Ken Beams served as a signaller for the Australian Light Horse in Palestine and on returning to Australia he trained in electrical and mechanical engineering after war. He then served an apprenticeship as a telephone technician later moving onto the area of wireless making. In 1924 he established a business making wireless sets which operated from his home first in Clemens St, Drummoyne near Five Dock and expanded to include the manufacture of various electric appliances, gaskets and washers. By the 1930s his business was known as Ken Beames Engineering Company. In the 1930s Beames began studying optics and mathematics in pursuit of his interest in astronomy. In 1934 he completed his first telescope, a 6-inch or 15.2 cm equatorial mount, reflector telescope. Late in the 1930s he began work on a 24-inch (610 mm) reflector telescope at this workshop in Drummoyne. He obtained the glass blank from Chance Brothers in England, and then set about constructing an electric grinding machine to grind and polish the blank. At the same time he worked on the equatorial mounting and the telescope tube and the optical and engineering work were complete by 1939 although the telescope was not assembled until after World War II. During the 1940s Beames also mounted a 17-inch (432 mm) Schmidt telescope and a 6inch (162 mm) refractor telescope used guide scope on the side of the main telescope. The Schmidt was never completed as the corrector plate was stolen before it was installed. During the war years Beames' skills in optics enabled him to make a significant contribution to the production of optical munitions. At the time, there were very few people with the skill and knowledge of optic production and his services were called upon to make sighting telescope and signal lamp reflectors for Aldis signal lamps used by the Royal Australian Navy & British Navy. The extent of this production is currently unknown as he probably sub-contracted to AWA in Ashfield and is not mentioned in the official history as a contractor. Nevertheless, preliminary research in the observatory archive and assessment of moveable heritage there indicates that his work producing optical munitions during the war was sizable. He also manufactured naval artillery fuse gaskets for the British Navy and parts for the airframes of Mosquito bombers for the Royal; Australian Airforce. It was also during the war that Beames joined the NSW Branch of the British Astronomers Association. At the end of the war Beames took steps to finally locate and assemble his 24-inch telescope in a suitable place away from the light pollution afforded by Sydney. It was first assembled in a sliding roof observatory building at Lisarow near Gosford in 1946 but the clouded night skies experienced there prompted Beames to purchase land at Linden in the Blue Mountains in 1948. The square brick base of the observatory building was built by his friend and fellow member of the British Astronomical Association, Albert York who was a builder by trade. Over the next ten years Beams designed and built the dome, and the electrical control systems including winding his own specialised motors. He built most of the machinery and equipment necessary to assist in the construction of the telescope which was housed in three workshops on site. Finally by 1959, the 24 inch telescope was installed in the observatory building and made operational. Beames had an association with those at the Mt. Stromlo observatory although there are few records of this visit to Linden by Bart Bok,Mt Stromlo Director 1957‚Äì66 and a letter from Mt Stromlo (Cyril Jackson) asking for help constructing a mounting for the \\"Ross Camera\\" to be used in production of a Star Catalogue. The letter states in part \\"I thought you the most likely person, knowledgeable and practical who could provide me with some ideas\\" and \\"you know that I was very impressed with the quality of your work and enterprise, and our observatory would like to keep in contact with you\\". It is not known whether Mr Beames was able to make the mounting or not. There is evidence from letters from the CSIRO, of Mr Beames lending the CSIRO Physics laboratory parabolic mirrors for ongoing experimental use. World War II optics While Beames' telescope attracted much interest from amateur and professional astronomers who assumed the optics to be first class due to his experience manufacturing optics during World War II no one else was allowed access to the telescope until the 1980s. This was when Wayne Orchiston, then working at Mt Stromlo Observatory and close friend, was allowed to make a number of observations in return for re-silvering the telescope's mirrors. Orchiston's observations confirmed the fine quality of the optics and the power of the instrument and further advanced the respect of both his amateur and professional colleagues. In the 1960s Beames turned his attention to the construction of a large planetarium. Although based on the original Zeiss model it was essentially designed from first principles to allow Beames to incorporate several innovations to improve the performance of the planetarium. Beames planned for the planetarium to form the centre of an astronomy education centre when it was installed in its own dome located on his property. Work continued on the planetarium and the mechanical, drive mechanisms and projectors were complete by the mid 1980s when illness prevented Beames from continuing with the project. All that remained to be completed were the star projection system and the lenses. In addition to his work making telescopes and optical instruments Ken Beames continued to operate his regular manufacturing business and made gaskets and fuel injector components for Leyland busses for NSW Department of Transport continuously from the 1940s to 1980s. This work helped to fund his ongoing work designing telescopes and other instruments. He also worked on other personal projects such as the brass clock and the brass leaved book ‚Äì the Rubaiyt of Omar Khayym. These objects display Beames' attention to detail and fine engineering skills and are regarded as an important part of the moveable heritage associated with the observatory. Ken Beames was very generous with his time for amateur telescope makers, and would advise them and give them materials to assist in their projects. For example, during a documented visit to Port Macquarie Observatory, Mr Beames constructed and donated to the observatory a set of apparatus for testing Foucault mirrors. Many telescope makers were given glass blanks and grinding powders with which to start their own telescopes. Ken Beams' manufacturing business 1986 and he died in 1989. The use of the site as an amateur observatory for the community continues until today.  Description  Telescope The observatory site is located on a lot of land sized approx. in the Blue Mountains. The listing curtilage encompasses part of this 20 ha and includes the main elements of the Observatory which consist of: # The Observatory building housing the 24 inch (610 mm) reflecting telescope and an adjoining room; # A sliding roof observatory housing a 30-inch (762 mm) telescope; # A machine shop which also houses the planetarium instrument; # A sheet metal workshop now used as a meeting room and telescope storage, with adjoining optical room; # A storeroom; # A constant temperature building; # Observing fields with concrete pads for telescopes to be mounted; # K. Beames' former residence. All buildings, except the sliding roof dome, are from the Beames' era, and house various parts of the historical collection. The telescope is a 24-inch (610 mm) diameter reflecting scope with a Nasmyth optical arrangement comprising \\"an unperforated parabolic glass primary , a 152 mm plano convex secondary and an optical flat which directs the light to an eyepiece assembly on the side of the telescope tube.\\" ( Orchiston 1989 ). The base of the 2.74 metre telescope tube is fashioned from a solid aluminium sheet while the upper extension is constructed in a \\"cross braced lattice design\\" ( Orchiston, 1989 ). The telescope utilises an equatorial mount the movement of which is achieved using a number of electric drives. \\"The main drive wheel contains 720 teeth and is operated by an electric motor, which is accurately timed by a seconds pendulum. A second wheel is used for fast slewing and also has a fine adjustment, while the third wheel is used for positioning the telescope in right ascension according to the setting circle. There is also a prominent declination circle and a declination fast slew motor\\".Orchiston, 1989 Another telescope, an incomplete Schmidt camera, is attached to the 24 inch telescope tube as is a large finder scope initially designed as a telescope in its own right and adapted as a guide scope. The telescope is located on top of a large solid brick pier within a building comprising a square brick base and a large 3.7 metre rotating dome constructed of steel and galvanised iron. The dome has two steel shutters operated by motors. The rotation of the dome is achieved by the movement of 16 wheels \\"driven from the hand paddle located adjacent to the eyepiece of the main telescope , or from drive controls located at various points round the dome ring\\".Orchiston 1989. The Observatory building also contains Beames' first telescope constructed in 1934. This instrument is constructed of brass and is also a finely crafted work. A cupboard contains various sights and lenses made by Beames as well as an electrical switch and power board constructed by Beames to power the large telescope and dome and the second pendulum which he designed and constructed to regulate the movement of the main wheel of the telescope mount. The telescope and the observatory building were all designed and manufactured by Beames in his workshops at Five Dock and later the workshops located on the observatory site. The only exception was the machining of the right ascension and declination shafts which were done at Morts Dock. The Observatory building also contains left over boxes of optical components of sighting telescopes and signalling lamps as well as working drawings and notes for his optical work during WWII and the construction and engineering of the telescope and observatory. Planetarium Various engineering workshops and other buildings house machinery used in his engineering business, and in construction his last project, a planetarium instrument. Workshops and buildings on site also house drawings, invoices, specifications and other parts of the collection including machinery . One workshop was a sheet metal workshop and while this now serves as a meeting room and storage space, it still contains sheet metal lathes and other tools. The banks of grinding machines that Beames specially designed for mass production of WWII optics for the Australian and British Navy and his other grinding and polishing equipment are located in a custom built temperature, controlled workshop located within the proposed listing curtilage. The main workshop houses machinery typical of engineering workshops from the 1940s and 1950s and includes a large number of lathes and other tools and is largely intact. This workshop also houses the partly completed planetarium instrument and clock. The planetarium is the only one to be designed and constructed in Australia. Similar optical star projecting systems located in Australia such as the HV McKay Planetarium in Melbourne and the Launceston Planetarium were imported from Ziess in Germany in the early to mid 1960s. Beams' planetarium although based on the Zeiss design was developed from first principles to allow Mr Beams to incorporate what he considered to be design improvements on the Zeiss model. Within the listing curtilage is located a modern 30 inch (762 mm) reflecting telescope housed in a sliding roof building, constructed around 2002 and Beams' house underneath which are located the mould and other accessories used in the design and construction of the telescope and observatory. = Condition = The historic telescope is in good mechanical and optical condition ‚Äì the mirrors were re-aluminised by Mt Stromlo Observatory as a gift to Ken Beames. The custom electrical equipment built by Beames has failed and parts are no longer available. Machinery in workshops shows signs of disuse, but is probably serviceable. Drawings, documents and notebooks are degrading and in need of conservation. Other artefacts are in a variety of conditions ranging from poor and in need of conservation, through to excellent, depending on age and storage. The collection of tools, machinery, dies, jigs, patterns, notebooks and drawings and other material associated with the construction of the telescope and other works by Beames has a very high degree of integrity in terms of the completeness of the collection, the variety of skill applications it represents, and the overall condition. = Modifications and dates = *Alterations made to power the dome and telescope drive by Beames in the 1980s to work around failure of some sub- systems. *New 3 phase sub-main installed in dome following lightning damage to old board in 2008. *30 inch (762 mm) reflector installed in separate building in 2002 for public access and observations. *8 inch (200 mm) and 12 inch (300 mm) mm reflecting telescopes purchased in 2005 and 2007 to assist public access viewing and education. *The original storeroom was lost in the 1977 bushfires and rebuilt in 1978. = Further information = Ken Beames' engineering business was originally located in Clements St. Five Dock, and moved to the Blue Mountains following World War II. Despite being highly regarded in the scientific engineering and astronomical community, the story of Ken Beames and his work remains largely untold. Following his death in 1989 (aged 89) his estate passed into the hands of a trust. With few funds available the trust, the Linden Observatory Trust has struggled to maintain the site with the help of volunteers and members of the amateur astronomical community. Ken Beames work and history is unique and worthy of research and conservation. The long term viability of the site is unknown and the collection and its integrity is at risk without conservation measures. The site is still in use by amateur astronomers in keeping with Ken Beames' wishes that it be used for amateur astronomy and education; on two occasions supernova have been discovered by observers at Linden. A significant assessment of Beames' sketches and engineering drawings has been made by Mr. Julian Holland in 2008. This work is being funded by a Community Heritage Grant obtained by the observatory trustees.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries The Linden Observatory is State heritage significance for its historic values as a rare and representative example of a twentieth century amateur astronomy observatory complex including telescopes and other instruments, dome observatory building and the complex of workshops and machinery used to make all the instrumentation and supporting infrastructure. The observatory is evidence of the significant technical and innovative abilities of its creator Ken Beames. He was one of the very few instrument makers working in Australia during the early and mid 20th century when most professional and amateur instruments were imported from Europe of America. Beames' work as an astronomy instrument maker and optics maker was highly regarded by his peers at the time and is still acknowledged as a major contribution to the history and development of astronomy in NSW. It is also tangible evidence of the continuance of the strong collaborative tradition between professional and amateur astronomers through the decades of the twentieth century. Ken Beames' contribution to the history and development of NSW is also marked by his input to munitions production during WWII where his skills at manufacturing optical components was sought after by the government faced with a dearth of ability in that area. The 24 inch reflector telescope made by Ken Beames and housed in the original observatory was the largest and most technologically advanced telescope in NSW from the late 1930s when it was completed up until the mid 1960s when the 24 inch and 40 inch telescopes were constructed and installed at Siding Spring Observatory. This telescope with its observatory dome was one of the first in Australia to incorporate electric motors to operate the telescope and dome. The intact complex complete with observatory, instruments, working design drawings, machinery, jigs, documentary archive is likely to be of State heritage significance as a rich research resource with the ability to provide insight into many aspects of the field of astronomy and the history of its development in NSW. Linden Observatory Complex was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 March 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Linden Observatory is of State heritage significance for its historic values. Ken Beames' 24\\" telescope housed in the custom built observatory was important in the history of telescope making in Australia and NSW as it was the largest Australian made telescope in NSW from the time of its construction in the late 1930s until the 1960s when the 40 inch and 24 inch telescopes at Siding Spring Observatory were designed and constructed. Beames' 24 inch telescope is regarded as one of the most significant amateur built instruments in Australia at the time it was built, and remains so to this day. While amateur instruments of this aperture are becoming more common, instruments of this size with professional standard mounting and drives are not. . The observatory where Beames made his telescopes and other instruments and optics associated with the strudy of astronomy is tangible evidence of the ongoing, strong and productive relationship between the amateur and professional in the field of astronomy from the late 19th century through the 20th century. The historic significance of the 24 inch telescope is increased by the fact that it was made by one of the very few Australian telescope makers working in Australia at the time. Not withstanding the uniqueness of his telescope making activities Beames was a prolific producer of telescopes producing around 450 instruments ranging from 6 inch telescopes through to the 24 inch telescopes . The 24 inch telescope was also one of the first telescopes in Australia to utilise electric drives to operate the huge telescope and its observatory dome. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Linden Observatory is of State heritage significance for its association with Ken Beames who constructed the observatory, its telescopes and the equipment required to make the observatory and instruments. Ken Beames was widely regarded as a master instrument maker responsible for the design and construction of the largest Australian telescope built in NSW before the professionally commissioned telescopes for Siding Spring Observatory in the 1960s. Beames also manufactured other astronomical instruments including the first Australian Made Blink Comparator for Father O'Leary of the Riverview College Observatory. Beames was an active member of the British Astronomical Association during the 1930s and 40s, although less active in his later life. Those colleagues in the association held him in high regard for his contribution to instrument making in the field as noted in the Journal of the British Astronomical Association \\" [Ken Beames] was one of Australia's most accomplished telescope makers of the 1930s, 40s and 50s\\" and \\"one of NSW's leading amateur astronomers during the 1940' and 50s\\".Journal BAA 1990 Although not a professional astronomer, Beames skills as a master instrument maker, his telescopes and observatory were highly regarded by his professional and amateur contemporaries. Ken Beames also made a significant contribution to munitions production during WWII when his rare skills in optics technology were used in the production of lenses for signalling lamps and telescope sightings for the Australian and British Navies. The extent of Beames' contribution in this field is as yet unknown although preliminary investigation of archives, personal reminiscences related by friends and the presence of machinery for mass production of these optical components indicate that his contribution to the production of optics during World War II was sizeable. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Linden Observatory is of State heritage significance because of the high level of technical achievement of the telescope construction by an individual practitioner, Ken Beames, which involved masterful skills in multiple engineering disciplines ‚Äì instrument design, drafting, construction, optical design, mirror making, electronics, electrical engineering, clock making, pattern making, fitting, turning & machining, founding, optical glass casting and lens grinding. Aspects of the telescope design were, at the time of construction, considered innovative and otherwise only used in professional installations, e.g.: the control of airflow with the telescope tube; the use of clocks to synchronise the motor drive with earth's rotation, full motor control of telescope and dome positioning while observing. The planetarium started in the late 1950s, while designed with reference to the Zeiss planetariums, is of Ken Beames' own design, built from first principles. It was the first and possibly only attempt to design and construct such a mechanism in Australia and represents a major technical achievement. Other well known planetariums in Australia include the HV McKay Planetarium, an imported Zeiss planetarium installed at the Museum of Victoria in 1965, the Launceston Planetarium, another Zeiss projector installed in 1969 and the South Australian University Zeiss planetarium installed in 1972. Ken Beames' workshop with its tools and equipment remains intact and includes work pieces, custom made tools, machinery and jigs which demonstrate practical solutions to problems encountered, including the need to mass-produce high precision items, e.g.: sighting telescopes, lens' and parabolic mirrors. All items of Ken Beames' construction, both the central objects such as the planetarium, telescopes and clocks, and the tools he constructed to hwelp make these objects, demonstrate very high levels of multidisciplinary craftsmanship. The moveable collection of items Beames constructed for private use or as gifts demonstrate high technical achievement and are aesthetically distinctive. The range of items runs from candle holders, brass jewellery boxes and cast bronze vases to detailed miniature working artillery \\"potato guns\\", brass grandfather clock, and a book made with brass pages ‚Äì Rubaiyt of Omar Khayym. This intact complex is instructive in the study of mechanical & electrical engineering and optics of the mid 20th century and exemplifies the astronomical and general engineering technology and methods of that era. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Linden Observatory is of State social significance afor the long and productive association that Ken Beames shared with amateur and professional astronomers. Many individuals and groups visited the site to learn from Ken Beames. The depth and variety of his demonstrated skills in engineering and telescope-making made a visit to Linden an inspiring experience. Visitors to the site have spoken of visits to the observatory in their childhood which inspired them to pursue careers in science and engineering. Beames also had a long term association with Jesuit scientists from the Riverview Observatory at Hunters Hill and later the Castel Gandolfo (Vatican Observatory) as well as astronomers at MT Stromlo Observatory and scientists at the CSIRO Physics Lab and many amateur astronomers. Beames' personal goal over many years was to turn the site into an astronomical education centre, and this is now a prominent goal of the site's trustees. The site is in regular use by amateur and semi-professional astronomers, with a regular beginners group, and regular observing night by the Western Sydney Amateur Astronomy Group (WSAAG). Courses sponsored by the Nepean Community College have been proposed and are being negotiated. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Linden Observatory is of State significance for its research potential associated with the fabric and its collection of moveable heritage including working design drawings, engineering equipment, telescopes, World War II munitions optics, documentary archive. Significant research opportunities are to be found in the archive in a number of areas such as: * History of telescope making in Australia * History of the construction of the Linden telescope * Manufacture of optical instruments in Australia * Optical munitions manufacture in WWII in Australia * Armament manufacture in WWII * History of amateur astronomy in Australia * Research into the production of 6\\" , 12\\" and 24\\" mirrors on home-made grinding machinery in the 1930s. The site continues its significant educational function as a place for the practice and teaching of amateur astronomy and telescope making. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Linden Observatory is of State significance as a rare example of a privately held historic observatory in Australia.Others include Tebbut's observatory in Windsor NSW, Linden, and the Ballarat Observatory in Victoria. Tebbut's observatory is older than Linden, but only housed much smaller instruments purchased by Tebbut. The Ballarat Observatory, which is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register, has a large amateur made historic instrument (the Oddie telescope) and is in this respect comparable to Linden. Linden's collection of associated workshops and material with its extremely high degree of association with the master engineer and instrument maker Ken Beames, and high degree of integrity, makes it unique in Australia. Amateur built telescopes of this size (24\\") with professional grade mountings are still a rarity. There are no other examples of amateur built telescopes in NSW. The only older example in Australia is in Victoria at the Ballarat Observatory. The commercial 30\\" (762 mm) telescope at Linden is the largest publicly accessible instrument in Australia. The observatory is the closest to Sydney to still have good \\"dark sky\\" viewing for most of the viewing field, and the site is used regularly by amateur and semi professional observers for this reason. Sydney observatory, by comparison, has been rendered unusable for all but the brightest objects by light pollution from the city. The 24\\" (610 mm) reflector at University of Western Sydney is a modern commercial instrument, but its location also makes it prone to light pollution. The planetarium instrument located at the observatory is an extremely rare example of an Australian made planetarium on this scale in Australia, and perhaps the world. No other sites of this kind in NSW have the high degree of integrity and completeness of the collection associated with the design and construction of the instruments. The complex is rare in terms of the collection of tools, machinery, parts, work samples and other material relating to the production of telescopes and optical instruments during WWII. It is unlikely that any comparable site exists. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Linden Observatory is of State heritage significance because it houses a collection representative of the art of astro-mechanical, optical and other engineering from the 1930s to the 1950s. The extent of the collection, its condition and quality is unique. The variable star observations for the Flare Star program, and supernova discoveries made at Linden are typical of the work contributed by amateurs. Being a \\"dark sky\\" site provides much more potential for high level amateur or semi-professional work to be done at Linden than exists at Sydney Observatory. The Linden complex is very comparable to the home of the Springfield Telescope Makers \\"Stellafane\\" in America. This is a collection of buildings and telescopes on a parcel of land at a similar altitude to Linden, also established around 1920‚Äì30. \\"Stellafane\\" is listed as a National Historic Landmark for its pioneering role in the development of amateur telescope making and popular astronomy in the United States.

It is a Grade II* listed building. The house dates from the late 16th century but was remodelled in 1749 with addition of second storey (third floor) to the main range. A wing was added in 1776 and a matching right wing added in 1872. It is constructed in ashlar with Welsh slate roofs. The central range is a 3-storey, 5-bay building connected to outlying 2-storey 2-bay side wings by single cell units. The house was the first house in England to benefit from a private gas system. History The site of the house and its parkland was a monastery estate prior to the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII and the original Tudor house was built for the Sotheby family. After Elizabeth Sotherby married Thomas Willoughby the couple converted the house into the larger Georgian style house of today. The estate duly passed into the ownership of the Willoughby family, passing first to Thomas' son Henry, who afterwards inherited from his cousin the title of 5th Baron Middleton, together with other estates at Middleton and Wollaton Park, where he actually chose to live. The 8th Baron Middleton, however, chose to live at Birdsall, employing the architect Anthony Salvin to extend the house and eventually dying there in 1877. His son, the 9th Baron likewise preferred Birdsall and likewise died there in 1922. In 1923 the family sold the Middleton and Wollaton estates and thus made Birdsall the sole family seat, which it has remained ever since.

Dahleh (born 1962, Tulkarem, Palestine) is the William Coolidge Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS). Prof. Dahleh is internationally known for his contributions to Robust control theory, computational methods for controller design, the interplay between information and control, statistical learning of controlled systems and its relations to model reduction of stochastic systems, the fundamental limits of learning, decisions and risk in networked systems including physical, social, and economic networks with applications to transportation and power networks, and the understanding of the Economics of data and the design of real-time markets for data and digital goods. For his work in these areas, he was awarded the Axelby best paper award four times, the Donald P. Eckman Award for best control engineer under age 35, and the presidential young investigator award. He is a fellow of both the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) societies. Dahleh is a current member of IEEE.  Education  Prof. Dahleh received his BS degree in Electrical Engineering from Texas A&M; University (College Station, TX) in 1983, and his Ph.D in Electrical Engineering from Rice University (Houston, TX) in 1987.  Biographical  Dahleh He was born in Tulkarem city in the West Bank, then raised in Amman, Jordan, and moved to the United States when he was 17 years old to attend Texas A&M.; He lived in Texas for seven years while earning his degrees in electrical engineering. Following graduation, in 1987 Dahleh joined MIT as an assistant professor, and achieved multiple teaching, research and leadership roles in academia, industry, and business sectors. He currently resides in Cambridge, MA with his wife and their three children.  Research and leadership  In the late 1980s, Dahleh solved the L1 optimal control problem an open problem at the time that addresses robustness in the presence of persistent disturbances- using linear programming techniques. This work pioneered the development of computational approaches for robust controller synthesis. More recently, his work has advanced the development of a foundational theory for information propagation, decisions, and robustness of large dynamic networks arising in transportation, energy, finance, and social networks. On the applied side, Dahleh has developed and patented a methodology for managing both engine and motor switching in hybrid vehicles based on path characteristics; the patent was co-owned by Ford. He also developed a Robust-Hybrid-Automaton architecture for designing autonomous vehicles that combines planning and control. Dahleh is the founding director of the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society(IDSS) effective July 1, 2015. The mission of IDSS is to provide an interdisciplinary home for decision theory, machine learning, statistics, and data science in the context of broad societal challenges. IDSS is a unique, multi-school initiative spanning the five schools of MIT: School of Architecture and Planning, School of Engineering, School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, Sloan School of Management, and School of Science. MIT's Provost Martin Schmidt announced the newly formed institute as an effort to \\"create a new entity that focuses on complex socio-technical systems, information and decision systems, and statistics.\\" Dahleh has served as the associate department head of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS) and acting director of the MIT Engineering Systems Division (ESD), which operated from 1998 to June 30, 2015. He is also a member of MIT's Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS), where he was Associate Director of 2007-2009 and Acting Director in 2010. = Research interests = *Networked Systems: Foundational theory for the interaction between physical, social and information networks, Information propagation, co-design of distributed decisions and incentives, learning network structure from data. *Fragility and Systemic Risk: The development of a foundational theory for the early detection and control of systemic risk resulting from idiosyncratic disturbance affecting components of a networked system. *Social Networks: Information cascades in stochastic networks, opinion dynamics, global games in modeling outcomes of crises, incentive mechanisms, interactions with physical systems. *Economics of Data: Characterization of the value of data, creation of a data market place, generalizations to digital goods. *The Future Electric Grid: Renewable generation, real-time demand response, impact of storage, market volatility, risk analysis, outages, Market Architecture. *Transportation Systems: Dynamic models of congestion under disruptions, dependence of fragility on network topology, cascaded failures, value of side information on performance. *Learning and control of unstructured systems: understanding the interplay between model reduction and learning low dimensional models, learning for control, learning behaviors with types using stochastic jump systems, learning low dimensional Hidden Markov Models.

In the media  \\"For his Ph.D in electrical engineering at Rice University\\" wrote Leda Zimmerman, of RiverRunMedia, for the Connector (MIT News) in 2014, \\"Dahleh was motivated by the potential for new approaches to control systems for such complex engineering feats as the Boeing 777 and the International Space Station. He created a computational framework for designing feedback control systems in the presence of uncertainty, a mathematical approach that allowed for a much simpler and systematic way to address complex performance requirements without sacrificing robustness or increasing risk. Because his computational formulas streamlined design processes, it became integral in many areas of manufacturing.\\" In an interview with MIT News in 2015, Dahleh explains that \\"in order to understand things like power outages and bank failures, you still need electrical engineers and economists ‚Äî but today you also need anthropologists and data scientists, too. Our ability to collect and aggregate data is already well beyond our ability to understand what it could tell us ‚Äî and no single discipline, on its own, holds the keys to solving this problem.\\" Introducing Dahleh as the keynote speaker of WEP2018, Jeff S. Shamma, Prof. Electrical Engineering at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia, described Dahleh's work with IDSS as \\"working on how humans and machines make decisions together.\\" Dahleh continued by speaking about the \\"networks that we are experiencing these days, how these networks have fragilities, and how these fragilities can be either mitigated or exemplified because of the human interaction.\\"  Awards  * The IFAC Fellow Award, in 2016, \\"for innovative applications of advanced control and signal processing methods that have been commercialized worldwide\\", awarded by the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC). * The George S.

Due to his father's sudden death Igor left for Kiev in the middle of production and stayed there for the next several years working at Kievnauchfilm again. He then returned to Moscow and started directing films alongside Tatarsky. Their most famous work was Investigation Held by Kolobki.Larisa Malyukova.

Nevertheless, Igor visited Tatarsky every year till his death in 2007 and discussed future plans. In 1993 Kovalyov was offered to direct the Aaahh!!! Real Monsters pilot. As he later recalled, this was his only studio project where he was given almost full artistic control after he and Csup√≥ had shown Investigation Held by Kolobki to the producers who became very impressed with it and asked for a similar style. Igor also rewrote the screenplay along the way, filling it with specific jokes and gags.World of Animation and Animations of the World. Episode 2: Igor Kovalyov documentary by Irina Margolina and Eduard Nazarov, 2002 In 1998 he co-directed The Rugrats Movie which grossed $141 million, breaking the box office record for a non- Disney animated film, although Kovalyov was left unhappy with it, claiming there was a heavy pressure from producers this time around and many of his ideas didn't make into the movie.Interview from Komsomolskaya Pravda, September 1999 (English translation) Csup√≥ also kept his promise and allowed him to work on his auteur films. Bird in a Window (1996), Flying Nansen (2000) and Milch (2005) gained a number of awards at international film festivals, although the latter was finished when the studio was already in sharp decline, and Kovalyov had to seek sponsorship from his former father-in-law, a famous Russian lawyer Genrikh Padva who is listed in the credits as a producer.Awards at IMDb Same year Igor left Klasky Csupo to teach animation at California Institute of the Arts.

The Polish- Slovak border survived in fact until September 28, 1939 (then it became the German-Soviet border), and formally until 1958, because only on June 13, 1958, the governments of the Polish People's Republic and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic signed an agreement solving border disputes. =2005 correction= Pursuant to an agreement between the Republic of Poland and the Slovak Republic drawn up in Lubovla on July 29, 2002 and ratified in 2005Agreement between the Republic of Poland and the Slovak Republic on changes in the state border and approval of border documentation: Near the observation tower on the Dukla Pass in the area of the Polish town of Barwinek and the Slovakian town of Vy≈°n√Ω Kom√°rnik, Slovakia gave up 376 sq m of territory, and Poland handed over territory of the same area (the change was dictated by the inability to restore the common border road to its previous state; built in 1958 to allow Slovak tourists to see the places of fighting.

Centered at the junction of North and South Streets with Whittemore Road, the district includes churches, schools and municipal buildings, many from the late 19th or early 20th centuries, as well as a diversity of residential architecture. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history Middlebury was settled in the early 18th century, but did not begin achieving an independent identity until 1790, when a congregational parish was authorized. It was incorporated in 1807, its land taken from surrounding towns. The town remained an agricultural area, lacking waterpower for industrial development and transport, and bypassed by the railroads. The town center arose at a junction of multiple roadways, where the first Congregational church was built, and in its early years included services such as a blacksmith and tavern. Due to its quiet rural nature, there has been little residential development in the center since 1840, with many of its civic and religious buildings added later, some as replacements for earlier structures. The oldest surviving building in the district is an 18th-century house, now on the grounds of the Westover School, whose campus is a major feature of the center. The oldest church in the district is the Greek Revival Methodist Church, built in 1832, although the 1935 Congregational Church is a reproduction of an 1845 Greek Revival building lost to fire. The adjacent town hall, a brick neo-Federalist brick building, was also built in 1935, the previous one having succumbed in the same fire. The Catholic St. John of the Cross Church, built in 1902, is a fine example of Colonial Revival architecture.

This connection is what Zolezzi has called \\"Innovation with Purpose\\". Zolezzi is Founder and Chief Innovation Officer of AIC Technologies LLC (AIC), a private initiative dedicated to the development of new technologies that provide solutions with technical and economic impact for multiple industries. He is also president of the Alfredo Zolezzi Foundation (AZF), a non-profit organization dedicated to promote and facilitate projects that connect science and technology with poverty, social unrest, climate change, corporate sustainability and others. Currently, the AIC laboratories and AZF offices are located in Conc√≥n, Chile.  History  Zolezzi was born on December 12, 1958, in Santiago de Chile. His family settled in the city of Vi√±a del Mar, where he attended his elementary and secondary school at Mackay School. Later, he enrolled at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Valpara√≠so (Chile) where he graduated as an industrial designer. In 2003, he led the Hydrocarbon Acoustic Stimulation (RMS) development, technology which increases the efficiency of oil extraction and recovery, through sound and ultrasound. The preliminary concepts were tested with the participation and support of the Department of Energy of the United States (US-DOE-CRADA). Later, Zolezzi decided to follow his own path and, in 2010, founded the Advanced Innovation Center (today AIC Technologies) In addition, he conceives and creates his own innovation model ‚Äì The Integrated Objectives Model ‚Äì which seeks to enable the development of high impact technologies that address some of the greatest challenges facing humanity today. The year 2011, following the model, the AIC team, created the Plasma Water Sanitation System (PWSS), a technology that eliminates viruses and bacteria in contaminated water through non-thermal plasma. Currently, AIC leads a team of experts in physics, chemistry, plasma, electromagnetism and industrial design, working on a range of projects based on advanced technology and new business models, which seek to solve the problems that today affect the sustainability of large corporations, addressing the needs of the most vulnerable people.

He was the brother of the Test cricketer Walter Robins. Early life and early cricket Born at Stafford in May 1907, Robins was educated at University College School, where he played in the cricket eleven. After leaving school he attended the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, graduating in September 1927, from where he was posted to the King's Own Regiment with the rank of second lieutenant. He was promoted to lieutenant in the same regiment on 1 September 1930. During a ceremony at Edinburgh Castle on 1 August 1931, Robins carried one of the colours of Barrell's Regiment, an ancestor regiment of the King's Own; these colours had been carried by the regiment at the Battle of Culloden and the ceremony united them with the standard of Clan Stewart of Appin ‚Äì who had fought on the Jacobite side. The colours remain in the collection of the National Museum of Scotland. Robins played minor counties cricket for Staffordshire in 1931, playing two matches in the Minor Counties Championship. In that same year he made his debut in first-class cricket for the British Army against Oxford University at Folkstone, with Robins also playing an inter-services first- class match in 1931 for the Army against the Royal Air Force at The Oval. His next appearances in first-class cricket came when he played twice for the Combined Services in 1937. Robins received promotion to captain in the King's Own Regiment on 12 February 1937 and was appointed the regiment's adjutant on 5 February 1939. Posting to India and WWII service His military career took him to British India, where he featured in first-class matches in 1938 and 1939, playing twice for the Europeans and twice for Madras. These matches marked his final appearances in first-class cricket. Across eight first-class matches, Robins scored 207 runs with a high score of 60, also taking 15 wickets with his leg break googly bowling, at an average of 37.53 and best figures of 4/36. Robins served with his regiment in the Second World War and was promoted to the war substantive rank of major, before receiving a full promotion to that rank on 1 September 1944. Robins was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for gallantry during the spring 1945 offensive in Italy, by which time he held the rank of temporary lieutenant colonel in the King's Royal Rifle Corps. He was further mentioned in dispatches for his service in Italy on 29 November 1945 ‚Äì he had returned to the King's Own Regiment by this time. On 25 January 1949 Robins was promoted to lieutenant- colonel and transferred to command the King's Regiment. Robins relinquished command of the regiment on 25 January 1952 and was placed on the supernumerary list of officers. Robins retired from the army on 13 January 1955 and was granted the honorary rank of colonel. Robins died at Congleton, Cheshire, on 26 June 1990.

Craftsman Foulis was made a master of the Edinburgh Incorporation of Goldsmiths and a burgess on 18 June 1581 after submitting an essay of silverwork. His master had been Michael Gilbert. A son David followed him into the craft.Jean Munro & Henry Steuart Fotheringham, Edinburgh Goldsmith's Minutes (Edinburgh, 2006), pp. 32, 142. In February 1581/2 he made new dies for minting coins, following the designs of Lord Seton's painter.Robert William Cochran-Patrick, Records of the Coinage of Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1876), p. 248. Working for the royal mint brought Foulis privileges and exemptions from taxes which brought resentment in Edinburgh, and the town's authorities refused to 'book' one of his apprentices in February 1591.Register of the Privy Council, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), p. 574. In March 1588 Foulis complained to the Privy Council about James Acheson, a son of John Acheson in Edinburgh's Canongate, who had a licence to make counters or jetons. Acheson's activities interfered with Foulis' monopoly as \\"sinker\\" or die maker. The Council declared that Acheson's making of latten (pewter) counters was not prejudicial to Foulis' rights.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1585-1592, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), p. 266. In 1590 he made a silver-gilt and engraved basin and ewer for Queen Elizabeth's christening gift to Elizabeth Stewart, the daughter of Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell and Margaret Douglas, and he advanced the English ambassador Robert Bowes ¬£20 sterling to reward the servants and musicians at the baptism, which was held in Edinburgh.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10, pp. 857-8: John Marwick, Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1573-1589 (Edinburgh, 1882), p. 332.

The bill was ¬£763 in 1582/3Maria Hayward, Stuart Style (Yale, 2020), p. 216. and rose in January 1588 to ¬£5,100. In June 1589 Foulis provided the king with two gold chains and rings worth ¬£953 Scots to give to the captains of an English fleet commanded by George Beeston. Beeston was also given a gold locket set with diamonds, costing ¬£373, and 100 crowns worth ¬£266 were given to his sailors. This generosity was connected with the aftermath of a fatal struggle between Beeston's sailors and Armada veterans on the streets of Edinburgh.Miles Kerr-Peterson & Michael Pearce, 'James VI's English Subsidy and Danish Dowry Accounts, 1588-1596', Scottish History Society Miscellany XVI (Woodbridge, 2020), pp. 11-2, 22-3, 61: National Records of Scotland, treasurer's accounts, June 1589. James VI sent Foulis and Robert Jousie to London in July 1589 to buy clothes and ornaments in preparation for his marriage to Anne of Denmark.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), no. 154. In pledge of payment for these purchases and for jewels and silver plate made in his workshop, James gave him two cut rubies and three cabochon rubies set in gold \\"chatons\\" or buttons, enamelled with red, white and black. Foulis returned these royal jewels to the depute- treasurer Robert Melville in October 1589, when James VI sailed to Norway. At Leith, Foulis also returned a large table cut diamond which he had held in pledge since January 1586 for the jewelry supplied to the king for New Year's day gifts.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1585‚Äì1592, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), p. 421: National Records of Scotland, treasurer's accounts May and June 1590.

In January 1597 Foulis was paid for a diamond and ruby ring, a ring with a great table cut diamond, a ring set with seven diamonds, a ring with eleven diamonds, a tablet or locket with an emerald and ten diamonds, and a \\"carcan\\" necklace with diamonds rubies and pearls. The total value was 790 crowns or ¬£2,765 Scots. James VI had given some of these rings and jewels as New Year's day gifts to his courtiers.Miles Kerr-Peterson & Michael Pearce, 'James VI's English Subsidy and Danish Dowry Accounts, 1588-1596', Scottish History Society Miscellany XVI (Woodbridge, 2020), pp. 81-2, 91-2. Miner and refiner In March 1592 Foulis was involved in a project to refine old silver Scottish coins with Sir William Bowes in London.Register of the Privy Council, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), pp. 730-3. Foulis also operated a copper mine near Edinburgh for the king and was permitted to use wood from the forest of Torwood to make charcoal for refining.National Records of Scotland, Privy Seal Register, PS1/65 f35r and f62v. In January 1594 he had a tack or lease given in acknowledgement of money owed to him by the king and queen, to mine and export all minerals and metals in the Friarmoor in Lanarkshire, a former possession of Newbattle Abbey.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1882), pp. 117-8. In March 1594 one of his mining experts Bernard Fechtenburg was tempted away by Lord Menmuir, Master of Metals, to work for Sir David Lindsay of Edzell Castle. Fechtenburg said that Edzell's samples of ores were more promising than an assay made by Foulis' other experts.Lives of the Lindsays, vol. 1 (London, 1849), pp. 342-4., In April 1594 he received a grant to prospect and mine for gold, silver, lead, tin and other metals, in Lanarkshire.The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707, K.M. Brown et al eds (St Andrews, 2007-2018), 1594/4/82. Date accessed: 28 September 2018. The grant mentioned mines previously worked by George Douglas of Parkhead.Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1816), pp. 84-5. He became known as Thomas Foulis of Leadhills. In June 1597 after one of his convoys carrying lead towards Edinburgh was robbed by border outlaws, the Privy Council authorised Foulis's carriers to have a lead badge with the king's arms and wear Foulis's own insignia, and anyone who tried to rob them would be executed.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1882), p. 395. The English gold prospector George Bowes complained in a letter to Lord Essendon that Foulis had disrupted his workings in 1604 by detaining his English timber man. He hoped that Lord Balmerino, Secretary for Scotland would help him. Bowes was staying at Codrus Cottage, above Wanlock Water.Robert William Cochran-Patrick, Early Records Relating to Mining in Scotland (Edinburgh, 1878), pp. 110-11, 113. In 1608 Thomas Foulis and George Foulis, also a goldsmith, assayed ore from a silvermine at Hilderston near Linlithgow. In 1613 Foulis obtained the contract for the mine with William Alexender of Menstrie and Paulo Pinto from Portugal. The mine at Hilderston had previously been developed by Bevis Bulmer, the \\"knight governor of the works of his majesty's mines under ground\\" with George Bruce of Carnock acting as treasurer.Robert William Cochran-Patrick, Early Records Relating to Mining in Scotland (Edinburgh, 1878), pp. 123, 141-152, 159-161, 163-6. Royal finance Foulis was involved in accounting royal money for the Chancellor, John Maitland of Thirlestane and his wife Jean Fleming, the \\"Lady Chancellor\\", in the years 1588 to 1590. The money came from the English subsidy, a regular gift to James VI from Queen Elizabeth.Julian Goodare, 'James VI's English Subsidy', Julian Goodare & Michael Lynch, The Reign of James VI (Tuckwell: East Linton, 2000), pp. 110-125. The accounts include a \\"cupboard\\" of silver plate for Maitland to which Foulis himself contributed ten silver trencher plates.Miles Kerr-Peterson & Michael Pearce, 'James VI's English Subsidy and Danish Dowry Accounts, 1588-1596', Scottish History Society Miscellany XVI (Woodbridge, 2020), pp. 59-74. This may be the cupboard of silver plate which James VI took to Norway, in Maitland's keeping, from which he gave gifts to Steen Brahe and Axel Gyldenstierne on 15 December 1589.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Wedding (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 39, 95: David Masson, Register of the Privy Seal of Scotland: 1585-1592, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), pp. 444-5. In September 1594 the king owed Foulis ¬£14,598 Scots and gave him two gold cups which he could coin into gold ¬£5 pieces if he was not repaid. These cups had been presented by the Dutch ambassador Walraven III van Brederode at the baptism of Prince Henry. At the same time, another creditor, John Arnot, was given a gold cup with the option to have it coined.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1882), p. 167. Foulis made an account for the years 1594 to 1596 of money received for James VI from the English subsidy, from the duty on his gold mines of Crawford Mure and Robert Mure, money coined at the royal mint by Thomas Acheson, and from the Secretary, Richard Cockburn of Clerkington.Miles Kerr-Peterson & Michael Pearce, 'James VI's English Subsidy and Danish Dowry Accounts', pp. 74-5. Elizabeth had let it be known that the money given to Cockburn should be taken to Scotland, and not spent in London, as had happened in previous years.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 5 (London, 1894), p. 8. Some money went to Foulis and Robert Jousie for clothes already delivered to the king and queen. Most of the rest was spent on jewellery given to Anne of Denmark, and to the ambassadors at the baptism of Prince Henry, or given as New Year's day gifts. The Master of Work William Schaw was given a hat badge in the form of a gold salamander set with diamonds. Some of the original orders signed by James VI survive, In May 1594 he wrote he to Foulis, who was in London, to buy lead to repair the roof of Linlithgow Palace and an alabaster stone for the new Chapel Royal at Stirling Castle. Gold chains for gifts to ambassadors in 1594 were made by George Foulis. On 16 August 1595 James ordered Foulis to repair and enlarge two silver chandeliers for Prince Henry. He gave the pen to the infant prince to mark the mark the paper, and wrote \\"I will testifie this is the prince's awin mark.\\"Miles Kerr-Peterson & Michael Pearce, 'James VI's English Subsidy and Danish Dowry Accounts', pp. 74-92. In May 1597 Foulis and Jousie were made collectors of a new custom of 12% on imports, with powers to confiscate the sails of ships in case of non-payment.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1882), pp. 388, 392. Bankrupted Foulis became involved in the administration of the Scottish exchequer by the group knowns as the Octavians. In October 1597 one of the group, the king's advocate Thomas Hamilton, married Foulis' sister Margaret. They gave him a role on 29 December 1597 overseeing royal expenditure. However, Foulis was bankrupted by the scheme on 17 January 1598.Julian Goodare, 'The Octavians', in Miles Kerr- Peterson and Steven J. Reid ed., James VI and Noble Power (Abingdon, 2017), pp. 182, 184-6. Roger Aston wrote that Foulis was treasurer in all but name and after twenty days \\"fell by his wits\\" and lay \\"in great extremity\\". David Calderwood called his distress a frenzy, \\"phrenesie\\". Aston wrote that he had hoped Foulis and Joussie would lend him money to buy land, but they had received no English subsidy for two years.Calendar State Papers Scotland vol. 13 part 1 (Edinburgh, 1969), pp. 155, 210. The English correspondent George Nicolson provided an alternative explanation for Foulis' distress, that James VI had taken back a jewel pawned to Foulis, the Great 'H' of Scotland. James had given the jewel to Anne of Denmark who, Nicolson says, had offered it to her friend Elizabeth Douglas, Countess of Erroll as recompense for the demolition of Slains Castle.Border Papers, vol. 2 (1894), p. 504. Foulis had received the \\"H\\" in pledge for a loan of ¬£12,000 Scots made to the king in September 1594, and the Privy Council asked his brother, James Foulis of Colinton to return it in January 1598.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1592-1599, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1882), pp. 433-4. The immediate cause of Foulis' financial disaster was a legal move by one of the Octavians, John Lindsay of Menmuir, Master of Metals, to suspend payments by the comptroller, George Home of Wedderburn. It remains unclear if Lindsay and other Octavians and the king planned this to bankrupt Foulis and if so, fully understood the consequences.Julian Goodare, 'The Octavians', in Miles Kerr- Peterson and Steven J. Reid ed., James VI and Noble Power (Abingdon, 2017), pp. 184-6. James Hudson wrote in May 1598 that Foulis had pawned a gold lion set with a ruby worth ¬£400 with the London goldsmith Robert Brook of Lombard Street, which Hudson suggested belonged to James VI.

The station is currently owned by Holdsworth Educational Media, Inc. and airs a Spanish Religious format. History KPIT was first proposed by the Millennium Broadcasting Corporation in November 2007, and receiving a permit to construct the Class A facility in December 31, 2007. The facility was originally proposed to operate at 500 watts, 39.81 meters elevation, from a transmission site just south of Lake Bob Sandlin, but decreased ERP to the current 450 watts in a subsequent application prior to sign on. KPIT has used the same transmission site near the lake since inception, which allows the signal to serve both its COL of Pittsburg, as well as the larger town of Mount Pleasant. KPIT uses a relay translator, licensed as K265DW Mount Pleasant, in order to expand coverage of La Campeona into the eastern parts of Mount Pleasant where KPIT's Class A signal can not reliably reach. K265DW was originally built as a relay translator for KETE Sulphur Bluff, Texas airing a Christian Contemporary format branded as \\"Way-FM\\", but was silenced for nearly a year, before changing to rebroadcasting KPIT as its primary feed after the sale of KETE from The Way Radio Group back to North Texas Radio Group, L.P., which did not include the Mount Pleasant translator, as North Texas Radio Group already owned it, having not included the translator in the original divestiture of KETE. KETE was then taken silent after the return acquisition, in order to increase power and expand coverage. On December 11, 2008, Millennium Broadcasting sold KPIT to Jabella Broadcasting. The sale was consummated on December 15. KPIT would change programming to the current Spanish Religious format accordingly, having begun its life as a Gospel station. On September 27, 2018, Jabella Broadcasting filed for a transfer of license for the facility, after an agreement was made to sell the station to Holdsworth Educational Media, Inc. for $25,000. The proposed sale is for KPIT only, and does not include K265DW, which remains licensed to and owned by North Texas Radio Group. The sale was consummated on November 23, 2018.

Only about five were built as it was soon outclassed by newer Polish aircraft but some were used until 1935. ITS-IIs were used in early training courses on air towing and another gave the first demonstration of glider aerobatics in Poland. It was also used to set one national record. Design and development ZASPL, the Aviation Association of students of the Lw√≥w Technical University, was the oldest aviation organization in Poland. Revived after World War I, by 1926 it had workshops in Lw√≥w which began building the glider designs of ZASPL member Wac≈Çaw Czerwi≈Ñski. His seventh aircraft, the second designed in collaboration with W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jaworski, was originally named the CWJ 2 but, in recognition of an Institute of Gliding Technique (I.T.S.) specification for an intermediate type training glider, was renamed ITS-II. The ITS-II had a two-part wing with a rectangular plan out to extended semi-elliptical tips. It was built around twin spars and covered with plywood ahead of the forward spar and with fabric behind. Broad-chord ailerons occupied about half the span. The wing was mounted centrally on a faired cabane and braced with a pair of V-struts from the spars to the lower fuselage. Its fuselage was ply-covered and hexagonal in cross section over much of its length but as it narrowed rearwards the vertical sides tapered away, leaving the cross section diamond shaped. The bottom was a box structure which mounted an ash landing skid. There was an open cockpit immediately ahead of the cabane. The glider's empennage was conventional, with a small fin carrying a broad, deep, curved, balanced rudder. Its triangular plan tailplane was mounted on the base of the fin and carried round-tipped but otherwise rectangular elevators that had a cut-out for rudder movement. The first flight of the ITS-II was made in November 1932 with an air tow at Lw√≥w-Skni≈Ç√≥w airfield. Handling was satisfactory and according to Cynk a small run of the ITS-IIa production version, which had a modified rear fuselage cross-section, began. About five were built. Samolotypolskie.pl's account is a little different, saying that in 1932 a few more like the prototype were completed and known as the ITS-IIa/32. These were then rebuilt as ITS-IIa/33s with reinforced rear fuselages. Both estimate that about five production ITS-IIs were completed. Operational history It soon became apparent that the ITS-II was out-performed by the 1933 Kocjan Komar glider and production ceased. The existing aircraft were used productively in 1933. The prototype took part in the first Polish training course on tow- launching, held at Warsaw-Mokot√≥w in February and two were at the next such event at Lw√≥w in July. On 22 April Maria Younga, based at Bezmiechowa, set a new Polish women's duration record of 110 minutes. At a meeting in Lw√≥w in the autumn of 1933 Micha≈Ç Blaicher gave the first exhibition of glider aerobatics seen in Poland.

It is currently the third tallest building in Stamford, after Trump Parc Stamford and Atlantic Station, and from 1970 to 1990 was the tallest building on the coast between New York City and Boston. It is currently the tallest office tower in Stamford. One Landmark Square was designed by Jordanian architect Victor Hanna Bisharat, who designed many other buildings in Downtown Stamford during the city's urban renewal efforts in the 1970s and 1980s. Bisharat designed the building after his own aesthetic preferences. It has been described as an imposing tower with a swooping form and scalloped-shaped entrances,, and has been compared to the TWA Flight Center, designed by Eero Saarinen, and the Cathedral of Bras√≠lia, designed by Oscar Niemeyer.  History  In 1960, F. D. Rich Company successfully gained control of the Stamford downtown urban renewal project, which was estimated to cost over $250 million. The original project plan included 14 office buildings known as Stamford Forum, three moderate-income housing developments, and a luxury hotel. Landmark Tower was planned as the centerpiece of the entire 118-acre renewal area, as designed by Bisharat. Bisharat said Robert Rich, then co-owner of F. D. Rich, accepted his design for Landmark Tower when he watched Bisharat. Lawsuits against the city and the Urban Redevelopment Commission regarding inadequate relocation housing following the use of eminent domain caused 8 years of delays to Rich's construction downtown, including Landmark Tower. This delay allowed the Rich to construct Bisharat's other buildings at High Ridge Park off the Merritt Parkway in North Stamford. Construction of Landmark finally began in 1970, almost 10 years after receiving initial approval for the project, and was completed three years later in 1973. In the 1970s, Landmark featured a large ice-skating rink at the corner of Atlantic and Broad Streets, a penthouse restaurant called the \\"Landmark Club\\", and art from the Whitney Museum's Stamford Branch. Five other buildings were built around Landmark Tower, in the mid-1970s to the early 1980s, to form Landmark Square. Landmark buildings 2 thru 6 were designed by architect Moshe Safdie and were constructed by F. D. Rich Company. By the mid-80s, the Rich Company was feeling the impacts of the early 1980s recession as major companies merged, moved, and laid off workers. Numerous other buildings were built in the declining market in order to maintain their contract with the Stamford Urban Redevelopment Commission and make construction deadlines. The losses due to overbuilding were insurmountable for F. D. Rich Company and lenders eventually foreclosed on many of the Rich Company's properties, including Landmark Tower. The entire Landmark Square complex was sold to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in 1991.  Recent years  Since 1992, Stamford Downtown has presented Heights & Lights which features Santa Claus rappelling down the side of the 22-story Landmark Tower, a holiday tree lighting, live music, and a fireworks show. Rappelling Santas have included the general manager of the New York Yankees, Brian Cashman, and professional baseball player and manager Bobby Valentine.left In 1996, Reckson Associates Realty purchased the entire six-building Landmark Square complex, including Landmark Tower, from Metropolitan Life Insurance for US$77 million. Over the next few years, Reckson invested another US$50 million to restore the complex and bring it \\"into the 21st century\\". Improvements included replacing hundreds of windows with energy efficient glass, renovating the lobbies, restrooms and elevators, adding new landscaping to the complex's two plazas, constructing an onsite cafe with indoor seating, and adding a New York Sports Club on-site. Reckson was later acquired by SL Green Realty in 2006 for US$4 billion. In 2005, the area that was once the ice rink was cleared to improve pedestrian access to Landmark Square and add ground floor retail. This new retail building was completed in 2006 and includes a large restaurant space and multiple retail outlets. Tenants in the new retail building include HSBC Bank and Blackstones Steakhouse. Since 2017, the City of Stamford has featured Landmark Tower in their official logo along with One Stamford Forum, another urban renewal building.

Built in 1847, it is one of the oldest surviving seaside coastal hotel buildings in the state. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. It now serves as the visitors center for the Connecticut Audubon Society Coastal Center at Milford Point. Description and history The former Milford Point Hotel is located near the tip of Milford Point, the most southwesterly part of the city. The point forms the eastern edge of the mouth of the Housatonic River, and is an area of conservation and wildlife management lands owned by the state and the Connecticut Audubon Society. The hotel building is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior, set on a raised foundation obscured by latticework. A single-story shed-roofed porch extends across the front, with Italianate square posts rising to jigsawn brackets. The interior retains much of its original layout, with three main public chambers on the first floor, and a corridor providing access to small guest rooms on the second. The hotel was built in 1847 by George T. Smith, and provided a seaside vacation experience to travelers arriving on the recently completed railroad which ran along the coast. This type of small boarding house was once a common sight on Connecticut's coast, but is now rarely seen. Its current setting, well back from the shoreline of Long Island Sound, is the result of natural sand deposition. Its Italianate features are probably the result of a major update of the property that took place in 1875. In the 1930s, the hotel and surround land were given to the state, which formed the wildlife management and nature preserve areas where it now stands. In World War II, the building was used as a military lookout station. It now houses the visitors center of the Connecticut Audubon Society's Coastal Center at Milford Point.

The church stands on the site of an Anglo-Saxon place of worship with some the original Saxon stones incorporated into the current church. Archaeology has determined that the site has been used as a place of Christian worship for over 1,400 years. The Ecclesiastical Court in the town was previously known as a Peculiar after it was given to the Diocese of York, but was deemed too dangerous and far away for the bishop or his tax collectors to travel to. All court affairs were presided over by the Peculier of Masham consisting of 24 men, known historically as the Four and Twenty. As it did not forward taxes to York, the court became quite rich, this led to some labelling it as the richest plum in Christendom. The church sits at the south east corner of the market square in the town. History The church stands on the site of a former Anglo-Saxon place of worship. A church is mentioned in the entry for the settlement in the Domesday Book when the lord of the manor was Gospatric, but it is not known exactly where it was sited and many have doubted that any part of the original church survives as part of the current architecture save for the odd stone in the church's walls. However, archaeological discoveries, most notably 57 Saxon bodies, have led to estimations that the site has been the place of Christian worship for over 1,400 years.In 1988, Yorkshire Water were laying a pipeline in the area and at least 57 skeletons were unearthed. They were dated to between 679 and 1011 AD and were all found a very short distance from the present church. The site of the bodies has now been marked with a plaque labelling it the Lost Graveyard. After a long evaluation by archaeologists, the bodies were re-interred in the present church's graveyard in 2009. Studies revealed that all the bodies were facing east (as per the early Christian tradition) and that they had not died as a result of battle or disease. The church itself was started in the 12th century with additions in the 14th, 16th and 19th centuries. The restoration of the church between 1855 and 1863 was down to Octavius Vernon Harcourt who had married the widow of William Danby in 1823. The church was restored after lightning struck the tower in July 1855. During the 19th century renovations, several carved stones of Anglo-Saxon origin were found to be embedded within the church walls with more being unearthed when the foundations were maintained. It was grade II* listed in 1966. The presence of the church is reflected in the name of the town; according to some sources Masham derives from Mass-Town as the presence of a church meant that that is where people travelled to worship. It was made a prebend of the Church of St Peter in York (York Minster) between 1154 and 1181 and its considerable distance meant that clergy from York could not travel to the town easily. It was therefore granted the right to be a Peculier, which has also influenced the name of a beer that is brewed in the town. The church consists of a vaulted south porch, nave, chapel and chancel, with two aisles (north and south) and a tower. The length of the church is roughly with in width at its widest point. The chancel contains a monument to Sir Marmaduke Wyvil (of Burton-on-Ure) and the south aisle contains many memorials to the Danby family from nearby Swinton. During the reformation, the rood-screen, decorations on the altar-rails and some off the stained glass was removed due to the puritanical considerations of the time. Most of the church is to be found in the Perpendicular style, however, some of the stained glass windows on the south side are in the Decorated style. In comparison to the rest of the church, the font is relatively new having been gifted to the church by the reverend Morton in 1862. The font is constructed of Caen stone with various religious symbols and people carved into the eight panels that flank the font. The tower, which stands at the west side of the church, is Norman in its lower three stages and is believed to have been erected in the 12th century. This three tiered structure had bell openings in them. In either the 14th or 15th century, an octagonal section was added and a spire placed on the top of that. A clock was affixed to the outer wall of the spire (previously it had been inside the bell tower) in 1732. The Four and Twenty from the Peculiar of Masham dictated that the face should be there as it would be \\"commodious and of great use to the inhabitants of the town and the people resorting to the market and fair, but also the country generally\\". The nave is separated from the north aisle by six bays and the south aisle has five. At the same time that the tower was amended in the 15th century, the clerestory was added. Anglo-Saxon Cross Shaft, St Mary's the Virgin Church, Masham. View from the west Whilst the church itself is Norman and medieval, the stone cross that is just outside the porch is of Anglo-Saxon origin. It is believed to have been carved in the 8th or 9th centuries and to have been dedicated to St Wilfrid, who was Bishop of Ripon between 667 and 669. The cross, which is tall and in diameter, used to be known as the Paulinus Cross and is decorated with early Christian carvings. Many of the carvings and representations have weathered over time, though Fisher argues that some were probably removed by those with Puritanical leanings during the Reformation. It is similar to the types of crosses found in churchyards in Wolverhampton and Dewsbury. The cross was grade II listed in 1966. The church is located on the south eastern corner of the market square in Masham town centre, though the entrance faces south with views of the countryside in that direction. Simon Jenkins in his book, England's Thousand Best Churches, awards the church and its churchyard one star out of five and describes the Anglo- Saxon cross as being In January 2017, the church was used as the setting for an episode of the BBC TV series Strike. One of the main characters hails from Masham and is seen getting married in the church. The Peculier of Masham Roger de Mowbray, the lord of the manor, was held captive during the Crusades and released after being ransomed by the Knights Templar. In gratitude, he donated the church to the Church of St Peter in York.This is the second time that de Mowbray had fought in the crusades, but most scholars agree that he died soon after being freed and was buried at Tyre. de Mowbray is said to have donated Masham church to York in the 1150s or 1160s which would mean it was after his first Crusade. Another possibility is that his son, also called Roger de Mowbray, donated it after his father's release and the two figures have become confused. However, because of its distance from York, the threat of the church's tax collectors being mugged on the long route between the two places and the extra burden of having to govern it, the Archbishop declared that the town of Masham, through its church, was granted the right to govern its own affairs. The term Peculier, which derives from a Norman word, in this aspect actually means Particular not odd as in the term Peculiar. As a result of this, the Peculier Court of Masham, consisted of 24 men (known historically as the Four and Twenty) which also gave rise to a name of one of the Theakstons' beers. The court is presided over by the incumbent of the church, and still has the right to rule on matters such as Between the 12th and 19th centuries, the court ruled on matters mostly pertaining to the church and adherence to Christian rituals not only in Masham, but also in the surrounding areas. People were fined for having non-Christian customs in burials, for not paying money into the collection plate, for wearing hats during communion and for setting up a school without permission. One man from nearby Ellington was excommunicated for not providing bread and water for a village walk. Others were punished for being Catholics or Recusants. Through not having to pay taxes to York, the court became quite rich and the power of its earning potential and endowments was renowned across the north of England. This gave rise to a saying the Peculier of Masham was the richest plum in Christendom. When the Theakston Brewery was formed in the town, their first beer, brewed in 1827, was called Old Peculier. In 1999, the brewery paid for a new stained glass window in the church that showed the seal of the Peculier of Masham (believed to be the figure of Roger de Mowbray) which Theakstons had borrowed for the design of their beer. A contract is signed between the incumbent of the church and Theakston Brewery to allow the use of the Peculier seal on their products. It was re-signed most recently in 1989 between the Reverend Brian Abell and Michael Theakston. Theakston also commissioned a new portrait of the Virgin Mary and the Baby Jesus as part of the deal that extends the licence of the seal until 2040.

Determined to present it at the San Francisco Zine Fest, she finished the first issue of the series in under five months. The series is categorized by its horror and gore, and the majority of it is stylized in black and white. Jetter exclusively uses people of color as her characters. Nuthin' Good Ever Happens at 4 a.m. is currently in production of its fifth issue. In 2015, Jetter wrote and illustrated a submission titled \\"Pull It Up From the Roots\\" for APB: Artists Against Police Brutality: A Comic Book Anthology. The anthology focuses on police brutality, the justice system, and civil rights. All of the proceeds are donated to the Innocence Project. In September 2017, it was announced that Jetter had been chosen to take part in a ten-issue production of the supernatural horror comic Box of Bones. The comic follows the life of an African American graduate student who is taken on a journey through the most violent times in African history by a mysterious box. Jetter also provided illustrations for Johary Ravelson's story ‚ÄúWater in the Rice Fields Up to My Knees,\\" which will be featured in Sunspot Jungle: The Ever Expanding Universe of Fantasy and Science Fiction. The anthology of science fiction stories will be released in January 2019. In addition to her published comics, Jetter also creates zines about her life as an African American woman. She shifts her focus from fantasy to non- fiction storytelling as she depicts a large range of topics including racism and the personal politics of Black hair. She continues to be an active member in the West Coast zine community. = Portraits = Trained in traditional mediums at CCA, Jetter creates and sells hand-drawn portraits. Some of her portrait subjects include Barack Obama, Martin Luther King Jr., and variant comic sketch covers of characters from The Walking Dead.  Activism  Jetter's artistry frequently incorporates themes of social injustice, micro- aggressions, and Black History. She has repeatedly discussed what it means to be an ally in social movements. She uses zines as a medium to express the impact of the racism and disenfranchisement of people of color and the rise of racial tension in her community. Jetter further supports marginalized populations by curating art shows that center around artists from underrepresented communities. The University of California, Davis has hosted her as a guest speaker to discuss the importance of decolonizing comics.  Personal life  Jetter currently lives in Oakland, CA.

The actthe periodic National Defense Authorization Act, the authorization bill for national security required the secretaries of Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and Agriculture to coordinate to produce a comprehensive strategy for countering biological warfare threats and other biological threats.Rachel Bartholomew & Kristin Omberg, Making sense of the 2018 National Biodefense Strategy , Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (January 18, 2019). The Donald Trump administration announced the National Biodefense Strategy of 2018 the following year. Later, the Donald Trump administration announced they would siphon funds from medical programs to supplement fundings for the strategy. When questioned about this, it was reported that the Obama administration provided the plans for the strategy. History and background Prior to the 2018 congressional directive, previous U.S. government biodefense strategies existed, including the George W. Bush administration's 2004 Homeland Security Presidential Directive-10 (\\"Biodefense for the 21st Century\\"), which was one of many laws and executive actions enacted following the 2001 anthrax attacks. The push for increased federal funding in biodefense began during Bush's term in office. For example, in 2006, Bush, in his annual budget request, asked for a total of $5.1 billion for civilian biodefense. This number was a decrease of $2.5 billion from the previous year's budget. The drop was primarily attributed to the absence of Project BioShield money in 2006; the money for that year was already allocated the previous year. Overall, the 2006 request contained incremental increases for all agencies involved in biodefense. Homeland Security Presidential Directive-10's primary focus was on preventing, detecting, and responding to potential intentional attacks using biological weapons, and set forth the role of the nascent U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other institutions. During the Obama administration, the 2009 National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats and the 2012 National Strategy for Biosurveillance built on the Bush administration's work, and expanded biodefense strategy to emphasis global health security and other public health crises, whether of \\"natural, accidental, or deliberate origin.\\" The Obama administration biodefense strategies encompass \\"human, animal, and plant health\\" and included roles for \\"federal, state, local, and tribal governments, the private sector, nongovernmental organizations, and international partners.\\" The bipartisan Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a privately sponsored group examining biodefense issues, convened in 2014 and issued a report in 2015. The panel, co-chaired by former governor of Pennsylvania Tom Ridge, warned \\"that the U.S. is dangerously vulnerable to a large-scale biological attack and has urged Washington to develop a more comprehensive strategy.\\" The panel specifically found that the U.S. had not adopted a comprehensive biodefense strategy over \\"a decade of profusion of policy directives,\\" and noted that there was a fracturing of responsibility for biodefense across multiple agencies and levels of government. These concerns prompted the U.S. Congress to include a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 that required the secretaries of Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and Agriculture to coordinate to produce a comprehensive strategy for countering biological warfare threats and other biological threats. 2018 Strategy Following the congressional directive, in September 2018, President Trump announced and issued the strategy. The strategy placed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in charge of leading the federal government's biodefense efforts, and designated HHS to lead a committee of high-level officials from the Defense Department, Agriculture Department, and Homeland Security Departments, to review the biodefense capabilities of the United States Intelligence Community and 15 other executive branch agenciesi.e., the agencies' capacity to counter naturally occurring and human-caused .biological threats. Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton said that the National Security Council would assist in the development of policy, and the interagency committee led by HHS would implement policy changes. Trump said that the strategy drew lessons from the 2014 West African Ebola virus epidemic. The policy was the work product of the reorganized NSC under Bolton.Kessler, Glenn and Kelly, Meg. (20 March 2020). \\"Was the White House office for global pandemics eliminated?\\". Washington Post website Retrieved 20 March 2020.White House. National Security Council. (8 September 2020). National Biodefense Strategy. White House website Retrieved 20 March 2020. According to Politico, \\"Senior administration officials later said threats could be better addressed by streamlining processes for biotech companies to work with the HHS's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which supports private sector development of vaccines and drugs.\\" One official from the Trump Administration said that the government's accounting requirements have made it difficult and undesirable for many companies to participate. HHS Assistant Secretary Robert Kadlec said that one of his top priorities was to get a decade-long extension of the Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund. The government can use that fund to buy countermeasures like vaccines, medication, and diagnostic tools. The fund was first authorized under President George W. Bush in 2004.

Until its dissolution in 1958, it was one of the most popular and prolific danz√≥n orchestras in Cuba, particularly due to the development of the danz√≥n-mambo by its two main composers and musicians: Orestes L√≥pez (piano, cello, bass) and his brother Israel L√≥pez \\"Cachao\\" (bass). Such upbeat version of the danz√≥n served as a precursor of the mambo popularized by P√©rez Prado, as well as the chachach√° created by Enrique Jorr√≠n, a violinist who started his career in the Maravillas. Other important musicians in the Maravillas were pianist Jes√∫s L√≥pez (unrelated to Orestes and Israel), timbalero Ulpiano D√≠az, violinist F√©lix Reina and flautist Eulogio Ortiz. Antonio Arca√±o, former member of singer Fernando Collazo's La Maravilla del Siglo, founded his orchestra in November 1937 under the name La Maravilla de Arca√±o, featuring many of the members of Collazo's group. Collazo himself complained about the similarity in the name, so by 1939 it was changed to Arca√±o y sus Maravillas. By then the band had become popular across the island due to hits such as \\"Mambo\\". Around 1944, they began to play at radio shows in Havana and the group doubled its roster. It became known as La Radiof√≥nica and Arca√±o as El Monarca del Danz√≥n (The Monarch of Danz√≥n). However, Arca√±o had to stop playing in 1945 due to lip problems preventing him from maintaining his embouchure. He continued as director and hired his cousin Jos√© Antonio D√≠az as flautist, who was later replaced by Eulogio Ortiz. Cachao left the group by the end of the decade (being replaced by his nephew Orlando \\"Cacha√≠to\\" L√≥pez, Orestes' son), but returned to record \\"Chanchullo\\" in 1957, one year before the Maravillas played their last show in Alqu√≠zar. Several reunions of the group occurred in the 1970s and 1980s featuring some of the original members. These were released on two LPs by Areito. History Radio CMQ, c. 1945: Arca√±o on flute, Orestes L√≥pez on cello, Cachao on bass. Born in 1911 in Havana, Antonio Arca√±o studied music with Armando Romeu Sr., playing cornet and clarinet and later learned the flute from his cousin Jos√© Antonio D√≠az. He later joined Armando Valdesp√≠'s group and Orquesta Gris. In 1936, he joined La Maravilla del Siglo, directed by singer Fernando Collazo. The members of this band became the core of Arca√±o's new band in November 1937: La Maravilla de Arca√±o. This charanga was composed of Afro-Cubans, all except for Arca√±o himself. He decided not to have a singer (vocalists were popular in danz√≥n since 1929) and decided to play mostly black venues, which paid significantly less than whites-only clubs. Nonetheless, this allowed the group to learn their trade and became particularly prolific: one year they performed a record 404 shows in total. Every night, las Maravillas would play in a different venue, including casinos, hotels, youth associations, blacks associations, etc.Entrevista con Israel L√≥pez \\"Cachao\\". 2003. In Spanish. Their long sets required them to have a vast repertoire, but thankfully most of its musicians were also composers. The brothers Cachao and Orestes would compose new danzones regularly, totalling thousands over the years. Many of these were dedicated to the venues they performed in, such as \\"Social Club Buenavista\\" (in Buenavista, Havana) \\"Club Social de Marianao\\" (in Marianao, Havana), \\"Redenci√≥n Sport Club\\" (in Pogolotti, Havana), \\"Juventud de Pueblo Nuevo\\" (in Pueblo Nuevo, Havana), \\"Avance Juvenil\\" (in Ciego de √Åvila), \\"Centro San Agust√≠n\\" (in Alqu√≠zar) and \\"Bella Uni√≥n\\" (in G√ºines). The band's first big hit came with \\"Mambo\\", a danz√≥n de nuevo ritmo, or as it would be called later, danz√≥n-mambo. This style, created by the L√≥pez brothers, added an improvised section to the end of the danz√≥n structure. This section, the \\"mambo\\", proved to be very popular with dancers, as it allowed them a certain freedom not present in the rigid structure of the danz√≥n. New genres would later emerge from this section, such as the fast-paced mambo and the slower chachach√°, both of which became dance crazes in the 1950s. They made their first recordings in April 1940, and in 1944 the group expanded its lineup for the radio, where they had their own program on Radio Mil Diez, sponsored by Gravi toothpaste and Dermos soap. This group was known as La Radiof√≥nica. At this point, the group was competing with the most popular ensembles of the island, and together with Orquesta Melod√≠as del 40 and Arsenio Rodr√≠guez's conjunto it formed Los Tres Grandes (The Big Three). In 1945, circulatory problems related to his lip prevented Arca√±o from maintaining his embouchure, which was the end for his playing career. He continued as director and hired his cousin and former teacher Jos√© Antonio D√≠az as flautist, who was later replaced by Eulogio Ortiz. It was Ortiz who recorded the 1951 version of \\"Mambo\\". Cachao left the group by the end of the decade (being replaced by his nephew Orlando \\"Cacha√≠to\\" L√≥pez, Orestes' son), but returned to record \\"Chanchullo\\" in 1957, one year before the Maravillas played their last show in Alqu√≠zar. Both Cachao and Orestes were playing in Havana's Philharmonic Orchestra at the same time as they were members of the Maravillas. In fact, many of their compositions were arrangements of classical pieces, and even film scores, such as Cachao's \\"√Åfrica viva\\", which quotes \\"Somewhere over the Rainbow\\". In the mid-1950s, Arca√±o signed with Panart, Cuba's first independent record label, and recorded twelve songs, some of which featured the Cuarteto Musicabana (with young vocalist Omara Portuondo) and blind pianist Frank Emilio Flynn (these were his first recordings). Nonetheless, in the 1950s mambo and chachach√° contributed to the decline of the danz√≥n, and by 1958, Arca√±o decided to put an end to his charanga after two decades of concerts and recordings. The final recording of the original band, and the only one for Gema Records, was \\"Chanchullo\\" by Cachao. The tumbao in the song was imitated by Tito Puente for his hit \\"Oye c√≥mo va\\".Sublette (2004). p. 451.

In Austrian constitutional law, a supreme executive organ (), is an elected official, political appointee, or collegiate body with ultimate responsibility for a certain class of administrative decisions ‚Äì either decisions in some specific of public administration or decisions of some specific . The president, for example, is the supreme executive organ with regards to appointing judges; the minister of justice is the supreme executive organ with regards to running the prosecution service; the president of the Constitutional Court is the supreme executive organ with regards to the operational management of the Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court itself, on the other hand, is not a supreme organ because its decisions, while definitive, are judicial and not administrative in nature. Although supreme executive organs, by definition, cannot be overruled by any other person or institution in the executive branch, the constitution still means for them to be politically answerable to the officials, institutions, or electorates that have installed them. The president, for instance, is elected by the people and can be recalled by the people; the chancellor is appointed by the president and can be dismissed by the president; governors are elected by provincial legislatures and can be removed by provincial legislatures. Most supreme executive organs can also be impeached or removed through parliamentary motions of no confidence.  Background  Austria is a parliamentary republic. The constitution establishes a number of features that can make the country look semi-presidential from a distance; most notably, the Austrian chancellor and the rest of the cabinet are not elected by the legislature but appointed by the president, who is in turn elected directly by the people. The semi-presidential elements are mostly nominal, however; the country is almost purely parliamentary in practice. Like any other parliamentary republic, Austria has no systematic separation of powers between its legislative and executive branches of government; the constitution engenders an intermingling of the two branches that has the effect of a fusion of powers instead. The intermingling exists on all three levels of government: * On the national level, the cabinet is unable to govern effectively without majority support in the National Council because the day-to-day administration of the country requires frequent updates to legislation. The National Council can also overthrow the cabinet through a vote of no confidence, which only requires a simple majority. As a result, the chancellor is chosen by the president on paper only; the president is more or less forced ‚Äì and bound by long-standing convention ‚Äì to appoint as chancellor whichever majority leader the legislature will preselect. The National Council, on the other hand, is rudderless without guidance from a functioning cabinet, to the point that it will readily dissolve itself if the ruling coalition breaks down and no other coalition emerges to replace it. * Provincial governors and their cabinets are elected by provincial parliaments. In seven out of nine provinces, the composition of the cabinet is in fact required by law to reflect the proportional strength of the parties in the legislature. * In some parts of Austria, mayors are chosen by direct popular election. In most of the country, however, mayors are elected by city councils. City councils are not parliaments in so far as they do not enact statutes, but they do issue ordinances (), a form of secondary legislation, and pass budgets. In a system like this, the way to prevent any one executive official or committee from becoming too powerful is a separation of powers the executive. The Austrian constitution thus divides the set of administrative decisions that have to be made into numerous disjoint subsets such that ultimate responsibility for different subsets lies with different persons or institutions. A person or institution with ultimate responsibility for some class of administrative decision is a supreme executive organ.  Terminology  The German word \\"\\" in the sense of a person or committee acting on behalf of an institution is usually rendered as \\"body\\" by professional legal translators, including in cases where the \\"body\\" consists of a single individual. This is done partly for stylistic reasons and partly to avoid ambiguity; the English \\"organ\\" is occasionally used as a synonym for \\"branch of government\\". Publications specifically about constitutional and administrative law, however, have historically preferred \\"organ\\".  Description  The Austrian constitution uses the term \\"supreme executive organ\\" multiple times but provides neither an intensional nor an extensional definition. Article 19 of the Federal Constitutional Law contains what appears to be a taxative enumeration of supreme executive organs, but this list is universally dismissed as specious and useless. The defining characteristics of supreme executive organs and the consequences of membership to the class have been established by case law and academic scholarship. = General characteristics = A supreme organ does not take orders () from any other part of the executive branch and cannot be overruled by any other part of the executive branch. Its decisions are final. If an organ has been declared supreme by constitutional law or conclusively identified as supreme by jurisprudence, any mechanism that would allow its decisions to be appealed is automatically unconstitutional. A supreme organ acts exclusively on its own initiative. On the one hand, it cannot be forced to act. On the other hand, its decisions cannot be made contingent on requests or nominations from other organs; it cannot be made to depend on the advice and consent of any other person or institution. The one exception to this general rule is the president. Most of the powers of the president can only be exercised on request of the chancellor, one of the other ministers, or the cabinet as a whole. Most decisions made on request of the chancellor or the cabinet do not become effective until countersigned by the chancellor; decisions requested by a minister other than the chancellor do not become effective until countersigned by that minister. A supreme organ is only supreme with respect to a specific class of decisions. A governor, for example, is a supreme organ with respect to certain decisions within the purview of the province. Much of what provinces actually do, however, is assist the national government with matters of the national administration. When acting in his or her capacity as an arm of the national administration, the governor takes orders from national administrators, most notably ministers. With the exception of the president, who discharges the powers and duties of his or her office either personally or not at all, supreme executive organs stand at the head of sizable bureaucracies and delegate most of their tasks to subordinate organs (). As a matter of general principle, supreme executive organs are vested with management authority (), meaning they are in charge of setting policy, of most personnel decisions, and of the internal governance and discipline of their respective bureaucracies in general. They also have injunction authority (), the power to issue orders () to their respective subordinate organs that require or prohibit specific substantive acts and decisions. Both powers follow from the postulate that supreme executive organs hold ultimate responsibility; an organ cannot be considered responsible for what it cannot effectively control. There are departures from this general principle, however. Some subordinate organs are \\"independent\\" (\\"\\"); they are subject to management authority but not injunction authority. = Rule of law = Executive organs can only exercise powers explicitly vested in them by statute and generally have to abide by the law, primary and secondary, constitutional and other. Supreme executive organs are not exempt from this rule. Supreme executive organs are also not exempt from judicial review; while their decisions cannot be overturned by other members of the executive, they be fought in court. = Answerability = On the one hand, a mechanism must exist for an ineffectual or misbehaving supreme executive organ to be removed. On the other hand, if removal is too cheap in terms of political capital or if the option is available to too many actors, the independence of the supreme executive organ becomes purely notional, the claim to ultimate responsibility a farce. The compromise implemented by the Austrian constitution distinguishes between political answerability for policy choices and judicial answerability for violations of the law. It involves three general rules: * A supreme executive organ is politically answerable, and can be removed by, the person, institution, or electorate that has installed it. Selected examples:  The president is elected by the people; the president can be recalled via plebiscite.  The chancellor is appointed by the president and can be dismissed by the president. A minister other than the chancellor is appointed by the president on nomination by the chancellor and can be dismissed by the president on request by the chancellor.  Provincial cabinets are elected by provincial parliaments and are subject to motions of no confidence by provincial parliaments. * A minister, including a chancellor, is also politically answerable to the National Council, which can order him or her removed through a vote of no confidence. * Supreme executive organs can also be impeached before the Constitutional Court for misconduct in office. Impeachment is limited to allegations of culpable violations of actual law; mere political malpractice is not enough. As a special case, the president can only be impeached for culpable violations of law. Cabinet members are impeached by the National Council. Most other officials are impeached by the cabinet. Members of provincial administrations are impeached by the National Council, the cabinet, or a provincial legislature, depending on the nature of the alleged transgression. The president is impeached by the Federal Assembly. The president of the Court of Auditors is impeached by the National Council or by one of the provincial parliaments, depending on who or what was being audited when the alleged transgression occurred. An obvious exception to these general rules are the two supreme executive organs that are justices, the president of the Constitutional Court and the president of the Supreme Administrative Court. Being justices, presidents of courts receive lifetime appointments in order to guarantee judicial independence. Even justices, however, can be removed in case of material misconduct: * Judges can be dismissed if found guilty of serious crime or severe ethics violations. Disciplinary proceedings are essentially trials, usually before one of the higher regional courts or before the Supreme Court of Justice. Members of the Supreme Administrative Court are tried by the Supreme Administrative Court; they are otherwise subject to the same regulations as regular judges. * Members of the Constitutional Court are exempt from conventional disciplinary action. Members that have proven themselves unworthy of their position can, however, be voted off the bench by a majority of two thirds of their peers. = Article 19 = Article 19 of the Federal Constitutional Law, the backbone of the constitution, empowers the National Council to enact incompatibility provisions that bar presidents, ministers, and members of provincial governments from holding positions in the private sector during their time in office. In its first sentence, Article 19 states that \\"the supreme executive organs are the president, the ministers and state secretaries, and the members of the provincial governments\\" (\\"\\"). The language seems to imply that this list is meant to be an authoritative, taxative enumeration. Early scholarship has tended to accept it as such. Modern case law and the modern scholarly literature observe that Article 19 is problematic in several ways: * The list is incomplete. * The list includes organs that are not supreme, or in fact not even organs:  State secretaries are assistants to ministers. A state secretary helps the minister manage the minister's bureaucratic apparatus and represents, if directed to do so, the minister in the National Council. The minister can delegate some of his or her responsibilities to the secretary; for instance, the secretary can be made head of one of the relevant ministry's sections. In all these capacities, the secretary takes orders () from the minister, meaning that the secretary is not \\"supreme\\" by any stretch of the imagination.  The members of a provincial government are not necessarily organs; they usually only an organ. * Written mainly by Hans Kelsen and following Kelsen's preferred ontology, the Federal Constitutional Law establishes Austria as a country with branches of government: the legislative branch (), which creates the law (), and the executive branch (), which applies the law (). The executive branch has two subdivisions: the administrative branch (), which deals with public administration, and the judicial branch (), which deals with conflict resolution. The constitution, accordingly, refers to supreme executive organs as organs of the . Article 19, on the other hand, refers to the supreme organs of the . Assuming this discrepancy is not simply due to a lapse of attention on the part of Kelsen, not an author generally noted for sloppiness, Article 19 was never meant to provide a definition of \\"supreme executive organ\\". Modern case law and the modern scholarly literature agree that the best approach is to simply be literal: a person or collegial body that is clearly meant to be supreme, executive, and an organ should be treated as a member of the class of supreme executive organs. The enumeration in Article 19 should be considered relevant only in the context of Article 19 itself: it should be read as a list of people that can be made subject to incompatibility legislation and should otherwise be ignored.

They thus experienced the rare feat of winning two Senior Championships in the same calendar year, as the 1919 final had been played on 25 January 1920. The panel of players that won those first championships included: Edward \\"Sonny\\" Wall, William Cullen, Jim Sweeney, Mick Byrne, Rev. E. Campion, Lar Sweeney, Peter Kavanagh, James Delaney, Jim Pender, Mike Delaney, Paddy Murray, John Sweeney, Matt O'Neill, Billy Tracey, Jack McAssey, Seamus Hickey, Tom Hickson, Tom Kelly, Peter McGuill and Pat Kavanagh. =Third Senior Championship, 1920 to 1952= When Carlow won the Leinster Junior Championship in 1923, Palatine players Ed \\"Sonny\\" Wall, Matt Hanely and Tom Dillon were in the team, with Jack Scully, Lar Sweeney and Mike Delaney among the subs. After relegation to Junior level following a dispute with the County Board (following a game with Milford in the early 1930s), Palatine won the Carlow Junior championship in 1936 and the Intermediate championship in 1938. They were re-graded back down to Intermediate again for the 1940 season, and won that title once more in 1948, returning to Senior. Much of the team that won promotion from Intermediate would go on to win the Senior championship in 1952. This team lost to Tinryland in the 1950 final and to Ballymurphy in 1953. They did, however, win Senior Football Leagues in 1950, 1952, 1953 and 1954. The panel that captured the 1952 title included: Frank McGill, James Mahon, Jack Mahon, Tadhg Hendricken, Andy Dooley, Liam Hendricken, Paddy Byrne, Tom Kelly, Mick McAssey, Sean Kelly, Billy McGuill, Billy Kehoe Jnr, Jack McAssey, James Deering, Luke Hickey, Sean Hickson, Paddy Hickey, Liam Murphy, Lar Moran, Christy McGrath, Jimmy Hayes, Pat Metcalfe, Seamus Harmon, John Brady, Mick Brady and Paschal Hayes. Mick Carroll and Mick Byrne were among the mentors. Billy \\"Skinner\\" McGuill captained the team, and he also captained the Carlow county team for the following season. Carlow beat both the reigning All Ireland champions and the beaten finalists (Kerry and Armagh respectively) to reach the National League final, only to go down to Mayo. =1952 to 2006= After defeating Ballymurphy in the 1952 final (0-6 to 0‚Äì4 in a replay, after the first game ended 0‚Äì6 to 1-3), Palatine went 54 years without winning a Carlow county championship, losing several finals before re-capturing the championship in 2006. Among those losses were a defeat to Ballymurphy in 1953 (missing out on the chance to become the last team to hold that trophy, as a new one was commissioned the following season), to Kildavin in 1970, to Naomh Eoin in 1986, to Old Leighlin in 1997, O'Hanrahans in 2001, and Rathvilly (after a replay) in 2002. Even though success in the Senior Football Championship eluded them, in 1971 Palatine captured a unique football and hurling double at Under 21 level, inspired in both codes by one of the club's all-time greats, Willie Cullen. There was another football and hurling double in 1985, this time at Intermediate level. After many close-calls in county finals, Palatine finally won their fourth Senior Football Championship after a 54-year wait, defeating Kildavin-Clonegal in the 2006 final by 1‚Äì9 to 0‚Äì11. Palatine led early on in the game, thanks in large part to a goal from Paul Reid. However, Kildavin-Clonegal had much the better of the play in the 2nd half and with a few minutes to go they led by three points. With the game entering its final stages, Reid burst forward and ran almost 60 yards with the ball to score a critical solo point. This started a comeback which culminated in midfielder Brian Farrell pointing from a '45 deep into injury time to secure victory for Palatine. Palatine lined out that day as follows: Tom Nolan, Paud Dwyer, Tommy O'Shea, Jeff Deering, Aidan Murphy, Joe Byrne, Gavin Farrell (0-1), Niall Reid, Brian Farrell (0-2, 0-2 45s), Patrick Cushen, Paul Reid (1-1), Eddie McGarry (0-2), John Kenny, John Reid (0-1), Brian Kelly (0-2, 0-2 frees). Subs: Eoin McMahon, James Reid. Paul Reid was later named club player of the year for Palatine, and Joe Byrne was named player of the year by the Carlow county board. In their first ever foray into the Leinster club championship, Palatine were defeated by Rhode of Offaly, 2‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì11. After a fractious game, Westmeath referee Peter Fox was struck by a Palatine supporter who subsequently received a lifetime ban from the GAA. =2007 to present day= Buoyed by back-to-back Minor Championship successes in 2008 and 2009 (the first time such a two-in-a-row had been achieved alone, though a Palatine-Tinryland combination had won Minor Championships in 1975 and 1976 as \\"Pal/St Josephs\\"), Palatine remained competitive into the decade following their 2006 win. However their next three appearances in Senior championship finals resulted in defeats by √âire √ìg. In 2007, aiming for a second ever two- in-a-row, they drew 0‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì7 with their town rivals, with Simon Rea kicking a late free to secure a replay for √âire √ìg. The town team won the replay easily, 4‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì9. It was a similar story in 2008, with Palatine in a position to win the first day, before eventually losing in a replay. It finished 1-10 apiece in the first game, with √âire √ìg coming out on top the next day, 2‚Äì9 to 0‚Äì11. In the 2012 final, Palatine were never really in the game, losing 0‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì5. But their young team came good for them eventually, with captain Jason Kane leading Palatine to back-to-back championships for the second time ever in 2015 and 2016. In 2015, they defeated Old Leighlin 2‚Äì12 to 2‚Äì8 in the final. The team that day was: Craig Kearney, Aidan Murphy, Bryan Farrell, David Kinsella, Chris Crowley, Conor Lawlor, Stephen Reilly, David Reid, Jason Kane (c), Tomas Kenny, Paul Reid, John Reid, Jamie Kenny, Ciaran Moran and Brian Kelly. Aidan Murphy was named player of the year for the club. In the first round of the Leinster club championship, they were beaten by Laois champions Portlaoise, 0‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì9. In 2016 county final, the defeated Rathvilly 2‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì12. The team on the day was: Craig Kearney, Conor O'Doherty, Conor Lawlor, Mark Rennick, Stephen Reilly, Chris Crowley, Jack Brennan, David Reid, Jason Kane, Paul Reid, Ciaran Moran, Shane O'Neill, Jamie Kenny, Tomas Kenny and Conor Crowley. In winning that day, Palatine became the last county champions ever to lift the Conlon Cup. (In 2017, a new trophy was commissioned). In the 2016 Leinster Club championship, they were defeated by Dublin champions St. Vincents, 0‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì8. Palatine lost their county championship when Eire Og defeated them in the 2017 semi-final. The town team who again got the better of them in 2018, when they defeated them in the county final by 0‚Äì9 to 0‚Äì5. The teams were all square at the break in the 2018 final, at 0-4 apiece. But Eire Og had much the better of the second half, and with county player Ciaran Moran missing the game through injury, and having lost main score-getter Shane O'Neill early on in an off-the-ball incident, Pal struggled to get on the scoreboard after half-time. Eire Og beat Palatine in a county final yet again in 2019, this time on a scoreline of 1‚Äì16 to 0‚Äì5. Since winning the county championship in 2006 for the first time in 54 years, Palatine have lost 5 county finals, all to Eire Og. 2 of those were in replays. (They have, however, won two county finals in that period, against Old Leighlin and Rathvilly). Hurling There is also a history of hurling being played sporadically at Palatine. Hurling was first played competitively at the club in 1963 and Palatine won a Junior Hurling Championship in 1965, before winning their sole Senior championship in 1972. The Palatine team that day lined out against Ballinkillen as follows: Brendan Hayden, Paddy Kehoe, Sean Treacy, Paddy Phelan, Brian Burroughs, Willie O'Rourke, Seamie Holmes, Tom Holmes, Seamie Woods, Charlie Keegan, JJ Canavan, Willie Cullan, Fran Mullins, Tom Bowe, PJ Byrne. They defeated their southern rivals by 4‚Äì9 to 0‚Äì18 A Junior Hurling Championship was captured in 1983, and an Intermediate one in 1985. Then - after the club took a break from hurling altogether for several years - in 2001 Willie Cullen captained Palatine to another Junior Hurling Championship at the age of 52. He also scored 1‚Äì4 on the day. Cullen was also top scorer in the entire country in 1978/79 National Football League, and has won an adult championship medal in five different decades from the 1960s to the 2000s Honours ;Football * Carlow Senior Football Championship: (6) 1918, 1919, 1952, 2006, 2015, 2016 * Carlow Intermediate Football Championship: (3) 1938, 1979, 1985 * Carlow Junior Football Championship: (5) 1913, 1936, 1948, 1965, 2010 * Carlow Under 21 Football Championship: (2) 1971, 1996^ * Carlow Minor Football Championship: (5) 1975^^, 1976^^, 1983^^, 2008, 2009, 2015 * Carlow Senior Football League: (10) 1950, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1977, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2004, 2007 ^As Pal-Asca ^^As Pal/St Josephs ;Hurling * Carlow Senior Hurling Championship: (1) 1972 * Carlow Intermediate Hurling Championship: (1) 1985 * Carlow Junior Hurling Championship: (5) 1965, 1970, 1983, 1990, 2001 * Carlow Under 21 Hurling Championship: (1) 1971 * Carlow Minor Hurling Championship: (3) 1967, 1968, 1970  References   External links  * ","title":"Palatine GAA"},{"id":"58603423","text":"Richard Vaughan (c. 1655-October 1724) of Derwydd, Carmarthenshire was a Welsh lawyer and Whig politician who sat in the English and British House of Commons for nearly 40 years from 1685 to 1724. Vaughan was the eldest son of John Vaughan of Court Derllys and his wife Rachel Vaughan, daughter of Sir Henry Vaughan of Derwydd, Carmarthenshire. He matriculated at Jesus College, Oxford 23 May 1672, aged 16. He was admitted at Gray's Inn in 1673, was called to the bar in 1680 and made a bencher in 1706.

Vaughan was appointed Recorder of Carmarthenshire for 1683-86 and 1688-1722 and a circuit judge on the Carmarthenshire circuit on 1715, serving as such until his death. Vaughan was elected Member of Parliament for Carmarthen for 1685‚Äì87 and 1689 to his death in 1724.

Life Betty Chancellor was born at 8 Fitzwilliam Place, Dublin on 9 January 1910. Her parents were John William Chancellor, a Dublin clockmaker, jeweller, and photographer, and Cicely Chancellor (n√©e Granger). They married in Billericay, Essex in 1904. She had an elder sister, Joyce Fanny, who also became an actress. She attended Nightingale Hall and Alexandra College, going on to train as a secretary. Her first appearance on stage was as a fairy in a benefit performance at the Gaiety Theatre in 1914. She appeared again at the Gaiety in 1922 as Gwennie in F. Anstey's The Man from Blankley's, Chancellor then studied drama under Frank Fay. In the 1920s she acted in the Dublin Drama League's productions in the Abbey Theatre. Once she joined the Gate Theatre her career progressed, establishing her as one of the principal actresses in the Gate by the early 1930s. Chancellor played Naomi alongside Orson Welles in a production of Jud S√ºss in October 1931. Welles became infatuated with her and later described her as \\"the sexiest thing that ever lived.\\" In 1931 she debuted in J. B. Fagan's production of The new gossoon by George Shiels as Biddy Henley at the Apollo Theatre. Her most noted roles were as Toots in Youth's the season in 1932 by Mary Manning; Laura in a production of Carmilla in 1932, based on the novella by Sheridan Le Fanu; Ophelia in 1932; and Cicely in The importance of being earnest in 1933. Touring with the Gate company in 1935, she played Stella in its production of Lord Longford's Yahoo performed in the Westminster Theatre, London. She starred with James Mason in the Gate's production of Pride and Prejudice in 1937. Disappointed with the parts she was getting at the Gate after that and much to the annoyance of Miche√°l Mac Liamm√≥ir and Hilton Edwards, she joined Lord Longford's first provincial tour in 1937. In the late 1930s, Chancellor worked more often in London. Following her appearance as Baby Furze in the 1938 production of Spring meeting by Molly Keane and John Perry, she was nominated as \\"Star of the Future\\" by the Daily Mail. She acted alongside Alec Guinness and Peggy Ashcroft in 1940 in Clemence Dane's Cousin Muriel at the Globe Theatre, directed by John Gielgud. She returned to the Gaiety Theatre in 1941, to act with Hilton Edwards in a production of Caesar and Cleopatra by George Bernard Shaw, a production that marked the 75th anniversary of the Gaiety. The press welcomed her return to the company, but her fellow actors were disturbed by the fact she was then living with Denis Johnston, the husband of fellow actress Shelah Richards. After Johnston's divorce, they married in March 1945 in Dungannon, County Tyrone. She partly retired from acting to raise their sons, Jeremy and Rory, but also due to her increasing deafness that had begun in her teens. In 1947 she appeared in Johnston's The moon in the Yellow River at the Arts Theatre, London with Jack Hawkins. The family moved to the United States in November 1948, where she had the lead role in Shaw's Candida at Amherst College, Massachusetts in 1950. They returned to Ireland in 1969, and settled in Dalkey, County Dublin. Chancellor died in D√∫n Laoghaire on 27 April 1984, and is buried at St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.

Life and career  Mishory was born on July 17, 1982 in Santa Monica, California, and grew up in Los Angeles, California. He is a citizen of the United States and Israel. He studied film at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Mishory's 2009 short film, Delphinium, about the legendary English artist Derek Jarman, was screened at dozens of film festivals before being permanently installed in the British Film Institute's National Film Archive. The film was subsequently re-released in the UK by the BFI as part of the year-long Jarman 2014 celebration. In 2017, it was presented by the Tate Britain Museum in London. His feature film debut, the 35 mm black-and-white Joshua Tree, 1951: A Portrait of James Dean, debuted at the Transilvania International Film Festival on June 10, 2012, and was released theatrically in the United States, the UK, and Germany, and received a Jury Prize at the 2012 Image+Nation Montreal Film Festival. Writing for Film International, Robert Kenneth Dator wrote, \\"Matthew Mishory has managed to capture an austere beauty of a kind little known by all but the likes of Baudelaire.‚Äù Mishory's second feature film, the documentary Absent, was filmed in remote rural Moldova. It concerns the village of MƒÉrcule≈üti, site of a horrible atrocity in 1941 in which all of the village's Jews were massacred by the Romanian army. The film introduces the current residents of MƒÉrcule≈üti, who seem to be unaware (or unwilling to discuss) what happened. Mishory's own grandparents lived in the village, escaping to Israel just before the start of the Holocaust. In an interview with the online magazine Tablet, Mishory discussed the complex emotions of filming there: \\"The history of MƒÉrcule≈üti and the Holocaust pose impossible intellectual and theological questions. All I can say is that my feelings about what happened in MƒÉrcule≈üti are complicated. I remain a practicing Jew. And I also have serious doubts about human nature.

The film was shot in Switzerland, Italy, Vienna, and Berlin, utilizing unexpected textures (such as Super 8, drone footage, and back-projection) and the German actor Udo Samel to chart pianist/composer Artur Schnabel's course through the emotional and physical landscapes of the European 20th century. In November 2018, the film was screened at The Library of Congress in Washington D.C. In 2019 it was released on the classical music channel medici.tv. In March 2018, Mishory began filming Mosolov's Suitcase, the story of the Russian avant-garde composer Alexander Mosolov, sent to the gulag by Joseph Stalin, with C√©sar Award-nominated actor Kirill Emelyanov in the title role. The same year, he began development on Goldberg Variations, a feature film co-written by Israeli screenwriter Golan Friedman and expected to be filmed in Israel. In 2020, a teaser was released for Mosolov's Suitcase, with further filming planned in Moscow and Palm Springs. Mishory also directs commercials.

The Ivanhorod Einsatzgruppen photograph is an image of the Holocaust, showing a soldier aiming a rifle at a woman who is trying to shield a child with her body. It depicts the murder of Jews by an Einsatzgruppen death squad near Ivanhorod, Ukraine, in 1942. The photograph was mailed, intercepted by the Polish resistance in Warsaw, and kept by Jerzy Tomaszewski. In the 1960s, it was alleged that the image was a Communist forgery, but that claim was debunked. Since then, the photograph has been frequently used in books, museums, and exhibitions relating to the Holocaust. Photograph historian Janina Struk describes it as \\"a symbol of the barbarity of the Nazi regime and their industrial scale murder of 6 million European Jews.\\" Background  During the Holocaust, more than a million Jews were murdered in Ukraine. Most of them were shot in mass executions by Einsatzgruppen (death squads) and Ukrainian collaborators. In 1897, the Russian Empire Census found that there were 442 Jews (out of a population of 3,032) living in Ivanhorod, a village today in the Cherkasy Oblast, central Ukraine. In 1942, a mass shooting by Einsatzgruppen south of the town killed an unknown number of victims. Part of the massacre is depicted in this photograph. After the war, the execution site was used as a field of a collective farm. Photograph Cropped photograph as it often appears in publications There are six victims in the photograph. The body lying at the feet of the German soldier appears to be a woman who was already shot. In the center of the photograph is a woman who appears to be shielding a child. One of her feet is raised as if she is trying to flee, or else the photograph was taken just after she was shot. To her right are four men. Only one soldier is fully visible in the picture; he appears to be aiming at the men. Rifles held by German soldiers off the left edge of the photograph are visible and point at the woman and child. The shadows at the left edge of the photograph suggest that more German soldiers may be present. A wooden stake and a shovel are visible on the right side of the photo. Robert Fisk hypothesized that the victims may have been ordered to dig their own graves before being shot. The identity of the photographer is unknown, but he was probably a German soldier. Many German soldiers photographed atrocities in which they were complicit. Discovery and publication The image as it appears on the cover of the 1959 book The Polish resistance infiltrated the postal office in Warsaw in order to intercept sensitive correspondence, which they sent to the Polish government-in-exile in London. Poles and Jews were forbidden to own cameras, but the Polish resistance established underground workshops for developing clandestine photographs of Nazi atrocities. A teenage boy named Jerzy Tomaszewski worked with an underground lab called \\"Foto-Rys\\", and he intercepted a photograph with the words \\"Ukraine 1942, Judenaktion [Jewish Action], Iwangorod [Ivanhorod]\\" written on the reverse. He kept the original, which remains in his personal archive; a copy was sent to the government-in-exile in London. The photograph was first published in Poland in 1959 by the Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy on the cover of a book of photographs entitled 1939‚Äì1945. We have not forgotten / Nous n'avons pas oubli√© / Wir haben es nicht vergessen. Tomaszewski worked as one of the editors, although he knew that the book was using the photographs for Communist propaganda; he supported the publication because there was no other way to print the photographs. Many publications crop the image to the one soldier, the woman, and the child. Fisk criticized this presentation, arguing that it makes the image more aesthetically appealing at the expense of historical accuracy. Conversely, photography historian Janina Struk states that cropping the image omits \\"the less emotional and more confusing parts of the picture\\". Since then, the Ivanhorod photograph has been reproduced in many books, museums, and exhibitions relating to the Holocaust. In her book Reading the Holocaust, it was described by Inga Clendinnen as \\"iconic in its distillation of German atrocity\\". According to Fisk, the photograph is \\"one of the most impressive and persuasive images of the Nazi Holocaust\\". Struk stated that it \\"has become a symbol of the barbarity of the Nazi regime and of the murder of 6 million European Jews\\". Falsification allegations The far- right West German newspaper Deutsche Soldaten Zeitung (DSZ, German Soldiers' Newspaper) printed an allegation on 26 January 1962 by Professor Otto Croy, known for his writings on photographic technique, under the title Achtung F√§lschungen (\\"Beware Fakes\\"). Croy claimed that the photograph had been fabricated by Communist authorities in Poland in order to falsely accuse Germany of war crimes; he alleged that the image did not depict a German soldier and that the weapons and uniforms were not authentic. Before publishing 1939‚Äì1945.

We have not forgotten) published another image from the same source in the Polish magazine ≈öwiat on 25 February. The second image depicted five armed men, one in civilian clothes and the other four in uniform, standing and looking at the camera over a pile of corpses. It bore several similarities to the better-known photograph, but lacked the \\"dramatic impact\\", according to Struk. The flat, barren terrain was identical; one of the men bore a strong resemblance to a soldier in the previous photograph; and the words \\"Ukraine 1942\\" had been written on the back of the image in the same handwriting. In the article, Tomaszewski described the DSZ as a supporter of the Third Reich and accused the paper of \\"revisionism\\". The allegations continued to be recirculated in the West German press for more than two years, in what Tomaszewski described as a \\"press war\\". The Polish government was concerned about a potential diplomatic incident if the image was in fact a falsification, and they sent officials to Tomaszewski's home to inspect the image. In 1965, Der Spiegel published a letter from Kurt Vieweg, a former member of a German police battalion stationed in Norway, and he confirmed that the weapons and uniforms matched those used by his unit and those of the Einsatzgruppen.

The donation can take the form of food, financial investment, reconstruction materials and many others and aims to the re-attainment of sustainable socio-economic development as well as to the re-organization of the governmental and judicial structures and institutions in the war-torn region.  Distinction from development and humanitarian aid  Post-conflict aid differs from the conventional development aid in many aspects. It is to some extent comparable to the aid granted in view of certain environmental catastrophes with huge impacts on the humanitarian situation. Just like countries facing a natural disaster, post-conflict countries are mainly confronted with a humanitarian emergency due to the destruction of infrastructures, institutions, public services and labor force as well as the death and injury of many people in the area. Hence, aid committed to the respective country can in both scenarios reach an extraordinarily high level but is likely to decline very rapidly as soon as the emergency has come under control. In both scenarios, technical help and human resources complement the material component of aid. In contrast, development aid is far more sustainable, not triggered by a single event, tied to certain conditions and mostly granted in the framework of an official international and national development program. Development aid is based on the principle help for self- help, whereas post-conflict and humanitarian aid strives to provide the means to manage a current crisis without a long-term plan. Still, post-conflict aid is more comprehensive that pure humanitarian aid directed to still the basic needs of medical supply, shelter and food in the aftermath of a humanitarian catastrophe. In its most encompassing form, post-conflict aid occurs during the reconstruction phase and the reinstallation of a functioning political system and the rule of laws.  Economics  A donor disbursing aid to conflict-torn country offers either humanitarian or reconstruction aid or splits its donation up. Reconstruction help (R) gets part of the receiving country's production function just like government spending would do since it is given to the country in order to invest it in the rebuilding of the economy. > Y=f(k,l.R) A donor, in contrast, only gives humanitarian aid until the basic needs of the population are satisfied, that is, until the donor defined level of consumption (c*) is reached. As soon as the actual consumption c equals c*, humanitarian aid will come to a breakpoint. Else, the humanitarian aid provided depends also on the short-run generosity Œ± of the donor, such that the overall post-conflict aid A is : > A=H+R=\\\\alpha(c*-c)+R = Economic impacts = According to neo-classical growth models, high growth rates are expected to take place in post-conflict societies until the steady state capital stock is reached. Following the Collier-Dollar model explaining the impact of post-conflict aid on growth, we find that aid is generally subject to diminishing marginal returns and that the impact of post-conflict aid on growth highly depends on the policy environment, meaning that in a better policy environment aid is more effective in boosting growth, resulting in the following equation: > G=c+b_{1}X+b_{2}P+b_{3}A+b_{4}A^2+b_{5}AP whereby X stands for any exogenous factors, P measures the quality of policy and A gives the amount of aid received by the conflict-torn country. In order to know the marginal impact of aid on growth, we derivate the above equation with respect to A: > {dG \\\\over dA}=b_{3}+2b_{4}A+b_{5}P Hence, aid reaches its saturation point at: > A^S={-(b_{3+b_{5}P)}\\\\over 2b_{4}} Aid given to states that are currently in a post-conflict phase has also a signaling effect on foreign investors that would otherwise not be able to assess properly the situation on the ground due to the lack of information about credibility and economic potential. Aid reflects the support and trust that an economy enjoys. One should assume a rapid acceleration in economic growth after a short post-conflict period since the prevalent uncertainty, which is typical under war conditions is resolved once the reconstruction of political institutions has started. Thus, investment and (technical) innovation is more likely to take place. In addition to that, the labor productivity might increase due to a more peaceful environment and the gradual recovery of human capital thanks to health care, growing opportunities of education and research and better nutrition. If peace can be maintained, it is to be assumed that a phase of catch-up will take place which will coast out after a given time and then the economy will fall back to its long-term growth rate. = Effectiveness = Addressing the question of the effectiveness and sustainability of post-conflict aid, evaluations have shown that it differs between sectors. All in all, post-conflict aid is effective in improving social infrastructure, like education, health, water, sanitation, and governance, but ineffective in rebuilding economic infrastructure, like transportation, communication, energy, and finance. Studies from villages in northern Liberia could demonstrate that post-conflict reconstruction programs, as part of post-conflict aid can have a measurable impact on social cohesion in this villages with sustainable effects. The power of post-conflict aid to increase the overall level of foreign aid is rather small, suggesting that there are no spill-over effects in the long run, even if the respective economy is in need of long-term support. Thus, post-conflict aid is timely limited and has a rather small effect on the tong-term growth. According to the World Bank report, post-conflict aid should be phased in slowly so that it reaches its peak level in the middle of the first post-war decade. At this point, it should be doubled before being reduced.  Aid patterns  Post- conflict aid is not granted without certain patterns but follows the donor's strategic rationales. The rationales can be of humanitarian nature or be based on the interest of implementing a peace agreement, typically in accordance to a political agenda. Another motivation might be the targeted state itself which might either be a client regime, or a region where the donor hopes to gain political or economic influence over. By looking at the donor-side, empirical research suggests multiple characteristics as useful predictors for post-conflict economic assistance: Aid from OECD countries starts in most cases in the aftermath of a conflict and increases over time, especially if OECD or UN Peacekeeping troops were involved during the conflict or the conflict management. OECD countries provide more aid to countries with a high level of democracy and an open-market economy but are more reluctant to provide it for (highly) developed countries. They are also more likely to assist countries which are undergoing a regime transition or change, especially if this leads to a donor-favored regime or peace agreement. But even countries with a donor-favored regime or peace agreement can lose funding in cases of ineffective policy-implementation, human rights considerations or a reduced sense of emergency. On the average this happens three to four years after the conflict.

Background and education She grew up in the town of Ruiru, in Kiambu County, immediately northwest of the capital city of Nairobi. She attended local schools for her primary and secondary education. In 2010, she was admitted to the University of South Australia, in Adelaide, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Nutrition Science degree. Career In 2011, at the age of twenty, Wawiru then an undergraduate in Adelaide, Australia invited 80 friends to a Kenyan themed meal. She charged $20 per plate, raising the equivalent of KSh126,000 at that time. With those funds, Food 4 Education (F4E) was founded. Starting with the construction of a makeshift kitchen, F4E started feeding their 25 first students. That was followed by fundraising campaigns on the internet. Over time, the number of children receiving subsidized school lunches increased. According to Wawira Njiru, it costs Ksh25 (approx. US$0.25) to provide a meal to an elementary school child in Kenya. The parents or guardians are asked to contribute KSh10 (approx. US$0.10). F4E provides the balance. To bridge the financial gap, F4E hired a full-time chef, constructed a new modern kitchen and began to deliver cooked-to-order-meals to corporate clients in the nearby Nairobi neighborhoods of Kilimani, Kileleshwa, Westlands, Upper Hill and the central business district of the city.

Background The Hammonds set the riots in the context of the enclosure of land in the period from c.1760, which removed common rights ‚Äì to cultivate, or graze animals, or collect fuel ‚Äì previously exercised by Yeomen, Copyholders, Cottagers and Squatters, to their great disadvantage or ruin; exacerbated by the constraints of the English Poor Laws, which served to prevent the poor from moving to or settling in other parishes. The riots occurred within the period of the French Revolution, a time in which the British ruling class had heightened concerns about the risk of revolution. The winter of 1794‚Äì95 was exceptionally harsh: January 1795 was the coldest month ever in the Central England temperature series with an average of .,Hadley Centre Ranked Central England temperature. and great floods are reported in February on the Rivers Severn and Wye resulting from ice breakup, snowmelt and heavy rainfall. Such poor weather led to exceptional scarcity of food early in the year, precipitating a crisis that, with enclosure and the poor law, had long been in the making. 1795 riots Scarcity of food led to riots across the country, in which women led or were conspicuous by their involvement. Rioters forced the redistribution of available of food-stocks; the Hammonds' characterise them as being disciplined and of good order, and, on finding themselves \\"masters of their situation\\", the rioters set fair prices for seized food and paid the proceeds over to its original owner. Riots involving women forcing food redistribution were reported in Aylesbury in March 1795, and in Carlisle, Ipswich, Fordingbridge, Bath, and Deddington, as well as in the counties of Wiltshire, Suffolk and Norfolk. In Seaford, East Sussex, militia brought in by magistrates to quell the riots joined with the rioters to redistribute meat and flour, for which two ringleaders among the soldiers were shot on 13 June. In Chudleigh, two mills were destroyed, albeit in this instance the Ipswich Journal speculates that men wearing petticoats were amongst the rioters. Responses Local actions were taken by magistrates against named rioters ‚Äì such as a 3-month prison sentence for Sarah Rogers of Fordingbridge, who redistributed butter belonging to Hannah Dawson at a fair price. More positively, a number of local initiatives are reported, especially in the provision of fuel at reasonable prices for poor parishioners; and more complex support such as the Speenhamland system. National discussion turned on a number of questions, such as of diet: could the poor be persuaded to subsist on cheaper brown breads and dispense with their use of tea? It appeared that they could not. Deliberations were made into the desirability of pegging minimum wages to the cost of provisions such as by Edmund Burke (against) and Arthur Young (for); a number of magistrates benches and quarter sessions had made such a recommendation. Samuel Whitbread introduced a minimum wage bill into Parliament late in 1795, winning support from Richard Brinsley Sheridan and Charles Grey and Charles James Fox; but the bill was opposed by William Pitt the Younger, and failed to pass a second reading. The government also undertook to bring in grains from abroad from Canada, Europe, and even Bengal.

He was born in Quebec, and graduated from McGill University with a Bachelor of Civil Law in 1903. He married Agnes Georgina Mills on September 30, 1905. In 1907, he moved to London, and became the assistant commissioner of the Canadian Red Cross Society in 1915 and the chief commissioner of the society in 1918. Throughout his life, Blaylock helped construct different types of buildings and aided soldiers during World War I, and received several awards and honours for these tasks. He died at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, at age 50.  Early life and education  Blaylock was born on January 6, 1878, in Quebec, to his mother Eleanor Marianne Lowndes and his father Thomas Blaylock. Both of his parents were Anglican priests. He and his family moved to Danville, Quebec when he was ten years old. In 1897, Blaylock graduated from Bishop's College School with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Blaylock became a part of the militia as a Lieutenant, but kept this position for only a year, due to having little interest with military. He studied law at McGill University starting in 1900, and received a Bachelor of Civil Law in 1903, at age 25. He traveled to Paris that same year, and studied law there, and returned to Quebec a year later, where he continued to study law. Blaylock met Agnes Georgina Mills shortly after returning, whom he married on September 30, 1905.  Career  Blaylock stopped studying law in 1907, and moved to London. Here he helped George Alexander Drummond with construction duties. World War I begun in 1914, during which time he helped the Canadian Red Cross Society organization, a Canadian charitable organization, which was led by Charles Alfred Hodgetts at the time and George Alexander's wife was very active in. In 1915, he became the assistant commissioner of the society. Throughout the war, Blaylock aided the Canadian soldiers, providing them a variety of services. At the end of 1916, his efforts resulted in his having to go to a hospital for 3 weeks, due to psychological shock and extreme fatigue. The Red Cross Society discovered that an attack, now known as the Battle of Vimy Ridge, would occur, which ended up taking place in early April. Blaylock, recovered now, went to the clearing station to the see the thousands of wounded men who were arriving. ‚ÄúWords fail one in trying to describe the horror of it all, but one noticed with wonder and admiration the cheerfulness and self-sacrifice of the wounded. No one seemed so badly hurt but that, in his opinion, the chap next to him was worse, and needed attention first. Men with arms hanging limp were struggling to help men whose legs were wounded; everyone seemed to be thinking of his neighbour,\\" he said. In April 1918, Blaylock became the chief commissioner of the Canadian Red Cross, as requested by Hodgetts. In June 1919, Blaylock was hit with pleurisy, forcing him to stay in bed until he healed. He became an honorary colonel on October 7, 1918, in the militia of Canada. In 1922, Blaylock went to Montreal, where he eventually became the council of several business companies, such as Montreal Development. Blaylock helped construct buildings in Quebec during the later part of his life, in Montreal and nearby cities and towns. On January 25, 1928, he died in Montreal, when he was 50 years old. He had been ill for the three weeks preceding his death, and was at the Royal Victoria Hospital when he died. By this time, he and his wife had had a son named Peter Woodburn.  Awards and honours  Blaylock received the following notable awards and honours throughout his life: * Legion of Honour (knight), on May 2, 1917 * Commander of the Order of the British Empire, on July 7, 1918 * Order of St. Sava, on June 7, 1919 * Legion of Honour (officer), on October 24, 1919 * Sovereign Military Order of Malta, January 7, 1920 * Commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy, on March 8, 1920  References   See also  *List of Bishop's College School alumni Category:20th-century Canadian lawyers Category:Lawyers in Quebec Category:20th-century Canadian businesspeople Category:1878 births Category:1928 deaths Category:Canadian Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Recipients of the Order of St. Sava Category:Bishop's College School alumni Category:Recipients of the Order of the Crown (Italy) Category:McGill University Faculty of Law alumni ","title":"Harry Woodburn Blaylock"},{"id":"58603777","text":"Carex straminea, known as eastern straw sedge, is a species of sedge native to North America.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History Annandale was to be a \\"model township\\". The developer, John Young, created the wide boulevard along the main ridge, Johnston Street, which was intended to be the finest street in the Colony and encouraged the symmetrical street grid pattern. Walter Goodman, a local shoe merchant and entrepreneur, chose the site to construct a large emporium. Designed by prominent architects, Sheerin and Hennessy the building was built in stages between 1890 and 1912. The stepped elements in the building facades give some indication of the staged construction, with the Johnston Street frontage and corner being part of the first stage. On completion of the building Mr Goodman occupied a grand apartment on the first floor and leased out his ground floor shops. In the late 1980s the NSW Department of Planning co-ordinated the restoration of the exterior of the building as part of a scheme to improve the Parramatta Road streetscape. The works at this time included the repair of the verandah structures, essential repairs and painting of the buildings‚Äô exterior. Paint scrapes were undertaken to determine the earlier colours which were found in the Pascol Paint range. Pascol donated over 700 litres of paint to complete the project. It would appear that a number of changes have been carried out, particularly to the rear of the buildings. The building is now occupied by a number of separate owners and tenants.  Description  Goodman's Buildings is a two-storey rendered brick commercial and residential building with Victorian Filigree details, high parapet and fa√ßade which curves around the Parramatta Road and Johnston Street corner. The building houses thirteen separate shops and residences above with renovated shopfronts on the ground floor with suspended awnings and narrow balconies over on the Parramatta Road frontage and wide posted balconies along the Johnston Street frontage. The first floor balconies all feature cast iron lace balustrade and posts which support the corrugated iron roof (ogee profile). Large double hung timber framed windows are regularly spaced along the first floor facades topped by rendered cornice and mouldings and bayed parapet with moulded cement balustrade and decorative urns at the end of each bay. A pediment bearing the name of the building is located at the western end of the Parramatta Road fa√ßade, corner and northern end of the Johnston Street fa√ßade. The fa√ßades and parapet conceal the skillion roof forms and rear wings which extend back to Albion Lane. Significance The Goodman's Buildings are of high historic, aesthetic and social significance as a relatively rare example of a grand emporium style building constructed in the inner city from 1890. The building is a largely intact example of a Victorian styled building constructed from 1890 that retains its overall scale, character and details particularly the first floor balconies and distinctive parapet and pediments. The building occupies a prominent corner site and has landmark qualities and makes a positive contribution to this part of the Parramatta Road and Johnston Street streetscapes.

The glen extends from Crianlarich eastwards to Killin with the River Dochart passing through it. The Saorach lochan is a natural feature, roughly oval in shape, sitting across the River Dochart from the old farm of Auchessan and is notable for at one time having a floating island on it waters as recorded in 1769 in addition to a normal island. History Lake Blanchemer, France - A floating island In 1769 the antiquarian Thomas Pennant, whilst on his first tour of Scotland, recorded that \\"...opposite to the farm of Achessan (sic), is a lake, noted for a floting island, fifty-one feet long, and twenty-nine broad, that shifts its quarters with the wind. It has strength sufficient to carry an involuntary voyage, the cattle that might be surprised feeding on this mobile solum, deceived with the appearance of its being firm land. it cannot indeed boast of carrying on its surface the darksome groves of those on the Cutilian waters, but, like the Lydian Calamina, may be launched from the sides of the lake with poles, and can show plenty of coarse grass, some small willows, and a little birch tree. He goes on to record as a foot note that \\"The thickness of this isle is twenty-five inches. Perhaps, as Mr.Gahn affirms to be the case of other floating islands, this might have originated from the twisted roots of the Schoenus mariscus, and Scirpus caespitosus, converted into a more firm mass by the addition of the Carex caespitosus.\\" Schoenus mariscus is now known as swamp sawgrass (Cladium mariscus), Scirpus caespitosus is now deer grass (Trichophorum cespitosum) and Carex caespitosus is Carex cespitosa. Auchessan Farm is recorded from at least the mid 18th century and is still occupied. Floating islands Floating islands are also known as tussocks, floatons, or suds and are composed of exposed vegetation that grows on a buoyant base of plant roots and other organic materials. In 1745 Herman Moll recorded on his map of Loch Lomond that it was famous for its floating island. The artist George Washington Wilson (1823 - 1893) photographed the remains of a floating island in the Luss Straits at an unknown date. Richard Franck, a Cromwellian soldier was stationed at or visited Loch Ness during the 17th century and wrote that \\"The famous Lough- Ness, so much discours'd for the supposed floating island; for here it is, if any where in Scotland. Nor is it any other than a natural plantation of segs and bullrushes, matted and knit so close together by natural industry, and navigated by winds that blow every way, floats from one part of the Lough to another, upon the surface of the solid deeps of this small Mediterrane.\\" Floating islands have been put forward as an explanation for sightings of the Loch Ness Monster.

In June 2017, the company received USD$30 million in a Series A funding, followed by USD$50 million in Series B funding in May 2018. It was bought by Maryland-based education technology company 2U in April 2019 for US$750 million. History Trilogy Education was founded in 2015 by Dan Sommer, whose father was a trustee for State University of New York. The younger Sommer had previously worked for an OPM, an acronym for companies which help universities bring their courses online. Rutgers was the company's first university partner. In June 2017, the company received $30 million in a Series A funding round led by investment firm Highland Capital Partners. By then, the company had 250 employees. In September, the company announced it was partnering with Monterrey, Mexico-based Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey (ITESM), to create a tech training program on ITESM's Mexico campus. Trilogy Education also started working with the University of Toronto in Canada. In May 2018, the company received an additional $50 million, in a Series B funding round co-led by Highland Capital Partners, Macquarie Capital and Exceed Capital. At the time, the company reported it had 7,500 current students currently enrolled, and 2,000 graduates of its programs. As of July, the company was working with 37 universities. It also announced it was looking outside of North America for additional partnerships. In October 2018, Trilogy acquired the Firehose Project, an online coding bootcamp, and JobTrack, an online career services customer relations management system. It was bought out by 2U in 2019 for $750 million, with $400 million in cash (in part with a short-term $250 million loan) and $350 million in newly issued shares of common stock. The acquisition was managed by Citigroup and Morgan Stanley. The acquisition increased 2U's number of university partners from 36 to 68, expanded its reach into the Mexican, German, Australian, and Canadian markets, and will allow for the company to reach a projected $1B in revenue in 2021. Prior to the buyout, Trilogy had planned an initial public offering. Business Universities share their brands and facilities with Trilogy Education, and provide oversight of the curriculum, instructors, and student experience, in exchange for a share of the tuition revenue. The courses are not taught by the university's professors, but by industry professionals with at least three years of experience. The company produces programs in areas such as web development; user interface/user experience; data analytics and visualization; and cybersecurity. Students train in coding languages such as JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, Java, HTML, CSS and Python, and the curriculum is developed centrally in GitHub. Revenue from the tuition is shared with the affiliate university. Though the exact revenue split has not been publicly shared, similar programs have a 50/50 split. Partner schools included Rutgers, ITESM, and the University of Toronto, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Washington, Columbia University, the University of Texas-Austin, Georgia Tech and the University of California at Berkeley. Program graduates receive a professional certificate (non-credit) from the partner school and career advice. There is no job placement guarantee and no third-party verified jobs reports have been released, though outcome data is privately shared with partner universities. The programs cost $10,000 to $13,000, though discounts may be available for partner university alumni. Trilogy's non-credit programs are not eligible for federal financial aid. The typical enrollee is a nontraditional student aged 31. Corporate training partnerships Trilogy has corporate training programs for TEKsystems at Southern Methodist University and General Electric at Georgia Tech.

It has been given the common name dwarf woolly jelly palm in English. It is locally known as butiazinho-do-campo or just butiazinho in Portuguese. The species epithet is derived from ancient Greek ŒºŒπŒ∫œÅœåœÇ (mikr√≥s), meaning 'small', and œÉœÄŒ¨Œ¥·øëŒæ (spƒÅÃÅdƒ´x), originally meaning 'palm frond' but referring to the inflorescence. Taxonomy It was first described in Berlin in 1930 by Max Burret on the basis of two specimens collected in the 19th century in Brazil; one collected by Friedrich Sellow in S√£o Paulo, the other by the cartographer Joseph Keller in Paran√°. He also cited another specimen collected by the entomologist Hermann Luederwaldt to the south of S√£o Paulo (no. 12267), which he mentioned was extremely close to the species as he described it. These specimens were all believed to be destroyed in 1943 during World War II by a fire caused by allied bombing. The fire also destroyed the records of where duplicates had been sent. In 1967 Sidney Fredrick Glassman described Syagrus hatschbachii as a new species from specimens collected by G. Hatschbach in Paran√° State in 1961, but after publishing his article, he discovered an old specimen from Luederwaldt (no. 12267) in the herbarium of S√£o Paulo which had been determined as Butia microspadix by Burret.C√¢ndida Henrique Mamede, Maria (2018). SP - Herb√°rio do Estado \\"Maria Eneyda P. Kaufmann Fidalgo\\" - Cole√ß√£o de Faner√≥gamas. Version 1.44. Instituto de Bot√¢nica, S√£o Paulo. Occurrence dataset https://doi.org/10.15468/axlcjr accessed via GBIF.org on 2018-10-01. https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1087274548 In 1968 he published his opinion that, although it appeared to be the same as the specimens of Syagrus hatschbachii he had, as Luederwaldt's specimen was of an immature plant he thus could not be certain it was the same, and as he found the specimen did not match Burret's description to his \\"satisfaction\\", thus he considered Burret's Butia microspadix to be a species incerta. He repeated this in 1970, but in 1979, after having studied additional specimens, he changed his mind and concluded that these two taxa were indeed the same. Description Butia microspadix is usually acaulescent, but may sometimes, rarely, develop a tiny trunk of up to 20-30cm, and 10cm diameter. It rarely exceeds 60cm in total height including the leaves, growing to a maximum height of 90cm. It is always solitary-trunked. It is very slow growing. It very much resembles a tuft of grass. The 3-10 leaves are pinnate and coloured greyish-green. The 13-20cm long leaf petiole is spineless, bearing only some fibres along the margins at the base. The petiole is 0.4-0.6cm wide and flat on top but rounded elsewhere. The rachis is 30‚Äì74cm in length. The 15-29 pinnae (leaflets) on each side of the leaf rachis are linear with an acuminate apex and inserted at a regular distance on the same plane per side of the leaf, so that each pair of pinnae forms a neat 'V'-shape. These pinnae are 13-40cm long and 0.3-0.8cm wide in the middle of the rachis. Similarly to B. eriospatha, it has woody spathes (in which the young inflorescence is developing) with the outside surface densely covered in a furry layer of lanate (woolly) tomentose indumentum; these differ from the spathes of that species by the hairs being shorter and darker purplish-brown. The spathe is 33‚Äì40cm in length, with an enlarged part 10-18cm long and 3.5-4.5cm wide. The inflorescence is branched and up to 17cm long. The inflorescence has a 27-32cm peduncle and a lanceolate prophyll 7-14.5cm long. The rachis of the inflorescence is 1-7.5cm long and has 3-18 rachillae (branches) which are 6-12cm long. The flowers are coloured yellow. The staminate (male) flowers are 5-7mm in length; the pistillate (female) flowers are 4‚Äì5mm in length. The shape of the fruit is ellipsoid (like an elongated acorn with a small cap/base, or a rugby ball with one end flat); but shape of the nut is globose (round). The fruit are 1.5-2cm long by 1-2cm wide, generally a bit longer than wide, with a juicy flesh. The fruit have been described as coloured brown, or, when ripe, violet or greenish-yellow, and covered in a rusty-coloured fur. The nut is hard, 1.1-1.5cm in diameter, has 1-2 seeds within, and contains a homogeneous endosperm. =Similar species= It is easily told apart from other miniature species of Butia by its densely furry spathes, with the hairs being woolly and persistent (not easily rubbed off). With its petioles lacking teeth along the margin it is most similar to B. archeri according to Glassman in 1979, although a number of other dwarf species lacking teeth have been discovered since then. It grows in the same region as the extremely rare B. pubispatha, another dwarf, grass-like species described as a new species in 2010, which also has petioles lacking teeth and furry spathes, but this species has a spathe with shorter, more pubescent hairs which can be rubbed off, and is also somewhat robuster and larger in size. B. pubispatha also grows much faster. B. eriospatha can also be found growing in this region. Distribution The species is mostly restricted to eastern highlands of the state of Paran√°, with small populations in the south of S√£o Paulo state. As of 2017, it has been recorded from only ten localities. Within Paran√° it occurs in the municipalities of Ant√¥nio Olinto, Carambe√≠, Jaguaria√≠va, Palmeira, Ponta Grossa, Seng√©s and Tibagi. Within S√£o Paulo it occurs in the municipalities of Paranapanema and Itarar√©. Within the extent of occurrence, an area of approximately 6000km2, it is calculated to occupy some 1300km2 (the area of occupancy), giving it an abundance of 21%, which is reasonably low compared to other species of Butia. The specimen Luederwaldt no. 12267 Burret cited in 1930 was collected, according to him, in Raiz da Serra (in modern Cubat√£o), S√£o Paulo, but the no. 12267 specimen Glassman had found in the late 1960s in the herbarium of S√£o Paulo was labelled as being collected in Rio Grande do Sul, thus Glassman concluded that the two specimens might not be the same, despite bearing the same collection numbers. Because of this, Glassman concluded that Butia microspadix was native to the states of Rio Grande do Sul and Paran√°, and possibly S√£o Paulo if one accepted Burret's description (he apparently didn't read Burret's statement that the Sellow collection was also likely made in S√£o Paulo). Because of the belief that this species was found in Rio Grande do Sul, a number of sources also state that it (probably) occurs in Santa Catarina state, which lies between Rio Grande do Sul and Paran√°, although it has never been seen there. In 2014, however, Soares et al. and a curator of the S√£o Paulo herbarium, Maria Mamede, pointed out that Luederwaldt had never been to Rio Grande do Sul, and spent his time in Brazil exclusively collecting in the vicinity of S√£o Paulo, which meant that the specimen had simply been mislabelled. Habitat It is found in dry grasslands or steppes known as campos gerais, where its unassuming habitus and thin leaflets makes it difficult to find camouflaged amongst the grass. It may also sometimes be found growing on rocky outcrops. It grows in full sun and in a red clay soil amongst thick campos vegetation. It shares its range and habitat with another dwarf palm; Allagoptera leucocalyx. It grows in an area that often sees heavy downpours (in the summer), and moderate frosts in winter. It has been recorded growing at altitudes of 790-920m. Its habitat is severely fragmented. Ecology It fruits in the summer. The fruits were found in abundance in the faeces of the crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous, 27% of total mass) and the maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus, 28% of total mass). Bees visiting the flowers in Vila Velha State Park in Ponta Grossa, Paran√°, include Ceratalictus clonius, Ceratalictus stigon, Ceratalictus sp. and Dialictus spp.. The Dialictus spp. were only found on Butia microspadix. Uses It is collected by palm enthusiasts as an ornamental plant and seed has sometimes been available from specialist retailers since at least 2015, if not earlier. It is said to be very ornamental. It is difficult to germinate, the seeds having low viability and taking more than 6 months to germinate. It is very slow-growing. USDA hardiness zone 9b. It is advised to plant the palms in full sunlight. It is said to take -5¬∞C, but should be protected at 0¬∞C in the Netherlands. Conservation In 1979 Glassman claimed that the species appeared to be quite abundant in Paran√°, apparently based on comments by Hatschbach. In 1995 the Secretaria de Estado do Meio Ambiente of the state of Paran√°, in partnership with the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Technische Zusammenarbeit (a German foreign development agency), rated the species as 'rare' in the state of Paran√°. In 2008 the species was rated as 'data deficient' by the Minist√©rio do Meio Ambiente of the federal government. In 2012 the Centro Nacional de Conserva√ß√£o da Flora rated the conservation status for Brazil as 'vulnerable', primarily due to habitat loss due to the pressure of agricultural expansion (although the actual extent of loss was yet unclear at the time). In a 2017 dissertation by Marcelo Piske Eslab√£o the species is said to ought to be considered 'vulnerable' as the IUCN categories B1ab (i, ii, iii) and B2ab (i, ii, iii) applied; this means that the extent of occurrence and area of occupancy (see distribution above) were below a certain threshold, and that according to Eslab√£o the population was in decline. Its habitat is severely fragmented. According to Alberto Leonardo Barkema, a Brazilian expert in palm horticulture, in 2009, agriculture (soya, wheat, cattle pasture) has so decimated the remaining habitat, that this palm can usually only be found in the verges of natural vegetation in the berm along the edges of roads. According to him it is being out-competed in such areas by more vigorous invasive species, notably grasses such as Pennisetum purpureum and those of the genus Brachiaria, as well as Eucalyptus and Pinus elliottii. Nigel Kembrey, an English specialist in Butia horticulture, seconds this, calling it \\"extremely rare and threatened\\". It is one of the most protected Butia species, being present in at least six conservation areas: the Nascentes do Paranapanema State Park, Vila Velha State Park, Cerrado State Park, Guartel√° State Park, and Parque Ibiti. At Represa Alagados in Ponta Grossa, Paran√°, it also grows on the grounds of a hydroelectric facility. Hybrids In horticulture, F1 and even F2 hybrids have been created with Butia eriospatha.

It was designed by William Julius Baltzer, an engineer in the NSW Public Works Department, and built by the Department in 1897. The property is owned by Sydney Water. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  The Johnstons Creek sewage aqueduct was constructed in 1897. The aqueduct was constructed as an extension of the Bondi Ocean Outfall SewerBOOS, completed in 1889 which was then known as the Northern Main Sewer. This sewer carried sewage from the densely populated inner-western suburbs of Balmain, Annandale and Glebe. The sewer necessitated the crossing of the 'Johnstone's Creek Valley' and 'White's Creek Valley' to deliver the sewage to the ocean outfall junction at the Junction of Parramatta and City Roads. The Northern Main Sewer was one of the Board's early major sewer schemes. The section of Northern Main Sewer, which embraces the aqueducts across Johnstone's and White's Creeks, was constructed under Government Contract No. 77 (basically the area between Catherine Street and Minogue Crescent). The design work for this contract was completed by early 1895, and which proposed the sewer be carried on mass concrete and brick arches and a lattice bridge. This scheme was subsequently abandoned in favour of using a carrier and supporting arches of reinforced concrete construction, the contract for which was let in mid 1896. The engineer credited with the design is W. J. Baltzer, an engineer in the Sewerage Branch of the Department of Public Works. Baltzer, a graduate of a German university, worked for the firm Carter Gummow & Co. which held the patent rights for the Monier system of reinforcing concrete. Carter Gummow & Co. were instrumental in bringing reinforced concrete construction to the fore. The design provided for a sewer carrier internally U shaped in section 3-ft. 6-in (1m.) by 4 ft. 6-in (1.37 m) constructed in reinforced concrete. The sewer carrier is supported by a series of reinforced concrete arches: There are 8 large spans, each of 81-ft 10-in (25 m.) centre to centre with a clear span of 75-ft (23 m.), and a number of smaller subsidiary arches at the eastern edge. The total length is 924-ft. (281.6 m.). Each of the arches is seated on mass concrete piers. It was repaired during the mid 1980s, consisting of the insertion of a plastic liner in the flume. The arches are in a stable condition.  Description  The aqueduct looking south down Hogan Park A series of slender reinforced concrete arches supporting the reinforced concrete sewage carrier seated on substantial mass concrete piers situated across Hogan Park through which the stormwater channel of Johnstons Creek is situated. The western terminus of the aqueduct is the western side of Nelson Street (which the aqueduct crosses), where there is a concrete retaining wall and public stairs. The aqueduct then crosses the shallow valley of Johnstons Creek continuing to the eastern terminus near Taylor Street. The aqueduct is a prominent feature within Hogan Park. There is a mature fig street situated close to one of the main central spans, its canopy encroaching over the sewer carrier.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries The Johnstons Creek sewage aqueduct was completed in 1897 and is a major and visibly strong component of the Northern Main Sewer extension of the Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer. The aqueduct arches and carrier are one of the first major constructions undertaken using reinforced concrete in NSW and one of the first in Australia. The slender proportions of the supporting arches and sewage carrier along with its historic technological value are a major landmark for Sydney. The aqueduct is a major element of the historic built environment of the local area, and a long held part of the recreational reserve . The significant elements are its location within a park setting, technology of construction and past and ongoing use. Johnston's Creek Sewer Aqueduct was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The aqueduct is particularly associated with the engineer W. J. Baltzer, and the firm Carter Gummow & Co. early advocates of the use of reinforced concrete (the Monier system) in this country, of which this is one. The Johnstons Creek sewage aqueduct is a major and highly visible component of the Northern Main Sewer extension of the Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer completed in 1897. The extension provided for the sewerage of the areas of densely populated inner-western suburbs of Balmain, Annandale and Glebe. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The sewage aqueduct is a prominent element in the historic built environment of Leichhardt and Forest Lodge. The aqueduct in consideration of its length, height and slender proportions is an impressive sight, and a landmark in Sydney. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The aqueduct is a major element of the historic built environment of the local government area of Leichhardt and provides a focusfor the contemporary community for an understanding of the historical development of the local area. It is listed by authorities such as the National Trust of Australia (NSW), the Australian Heritage Commission, and the Institution of Engineers (Australia). The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The aqueduct is one of the first major constructions undertaken using reinforced concrete in NSW and one of the first in Australia. The built fabric is therefore a unique repository for the study of the early development of reinforced construction. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It is rare in Australia in consideration of the extent and date of the reinforced construction technique. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. It is representative in its function which is widespread across Sydney.

It was built by 1882 by James Reynolds, with alterations when it was enlarged in 1924. It is also known as Elkington Park Baths, Balmain Baths, Corporation Baths, Dawn Fraser Baths and Whitehorse Point Baths. The property is owned by the Inner West Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 June 2000. Hilltop view of the Dawn Fraser Baths  History  Balmain Council acquired land at White Horse Point for public baths in 1880. A tender by James Reynolds was accepted in 1881 and the baths were in use by January 1882. They were open to men during daylight hours and at limited times for women.EJE Landscape 1994 The Balmain Swimming Club was founded in 1884 shortly after the baths were opened. When it celebrated its centenary, it was the first club to do so. The club is also thought to be the first swimming association in Australia and many of its members have achieved distinction in swimming, water polo, diving and life-saving.Walker 1991 In 1902 the original 1882 enclosure was replaced with one giving a width of 60 yards owing to pressure from the Club. A two- storey changing and viewing pavilion (south) was added as well as two boardwalks extending out from the shore and one diagonal boardwalk. In 1904 a cottage was built in Elkington Park for the manager of the baths. In 1924 the baths and structures were enlarged. Other main alterations were a north facing changing pavilion and grandstand, two springboards and a tower, a two-storey entry pavilion in the south pavilion, changing boxes on the west and east boardwalks, and the Western Shed. Swimmers who used the baths included Tony Fenech, Frank Jordan and Dawn Fraser. Repairs and alterations were carried out in 1956, 1957, 1959; a seating gallery was installed in 1961 and a stone wall was built around the children's pool in 1962. In 1964 the pool was renamed in honour of Dawn Fraser, local resident and Olympic Swimming Champion at three consecutive Olympic Games. Dawn Fraser learnt to swim at the baths and swam with the Leichhardt-Balmain League of Swimmers from age 8 to 13. She then had two seasons with the Balmain Ladies Club and won two New South Wales Championships. In 1983 the complex was refurbished and at this time much of the fabric of the building was replaced, the lattice was rebuilt and reinstated and the exterior cladding around the edge of the baths above the water was changed from corrugated iron to timber.  Description  An irregular shaped swimming pool, enclosed by a timber structure, supported by timber piles where it is above the harbour. The main swimming area is almost square with the southern side curved to follow the shore. In the south-west corner, a wedge-shaped children's pool has been made to fit in with the existing configuration. The entrance to the baths is marked by a squat tower, which separates two timber buildings following the curve of the foreshore and contain the changing rooms for men and women and the swimming pool office. The buildings on the harbour side house the Balmain Swimming Club including club change rooms and there is also a tiered stand for spectators. The room in the tower houses the archives of the swimming club, which go back to 1884 and also served as a club meeting rooms. The pool itself is surrounded by a timber deck used for access, watching swimming races and sunbaking. At low tides there is a small sandy beach alongside the entrance. Nearby, in Elkington Park, is a brick cottage for the manager of the baths.  Heritage listing  The pool is a complete swimming complex extending back to the turn-of-the century. It is an excellent example of pool architecture no longer practiced and a well known Sydney landmark set in an attractive harbourside location which has become a feature of the pool.

The British government's response took many forms including the reactivation of Fencible regiments and the Sea Fencibles, a program of the construction of Martello Towers along the coasts of Britain and Ireland, and the commissioning of a number of armed defense ships. The British East India Company in November voted to underwrite 10,000 tons (bm) of armed transports to protect Great Britain's coasts.

Founded in 2011 by Carl Chang, the brother of former tennis player Michael Chang, Pieology's mission is to \\"turn one of America's favorite food into an affordable and interactive experience\\". Pieology's main rivals are Blaze Pizza and MOD Pizza. By October 2018, Pieology had a single unit in Mexico plus approximately 140 units in 23 American states and territories with more than half of those restaurants located in the state of California.  Concept  Similar to their competitors, Pieology offers individual, artisan style pizzas, which are baked in a high-temperature open-flame oven. Customers begin by choosing which of the ingredients they'd like on their pizza pie. As customers work their way down the service line, staff assemble a pizza based on customer instructions. When they arrive at the end of the line, their custom-built pizza is ready to be cooked. Pieology offers several signature pizzas, as well \\"build your own\\" custom pizzas. In addition, their menu includes salads and desserts. Each Pieology restaurant is meant to be an \\"environment that [creates] inspiration\\", with a quote board in every store that features inspirational quotes. History The first Pieology was opened in March 2011 in Fullerton, California, just a few blocks away from the campus of California State University, Fullerton, by partners Carl Chang and James Markham. During its first few months of operation, the business was known as Pie-ology Pizzeria. Chang and Markham were previously involved with the development of MOD Pizza. Markham left the partnership the following year. After the success of the first location, a second location was opened in nearby Irvine (near the campus of University of California, Irvine) in November 2012. For the first few years, initial growth was restricted to company-owned locations in Southern California. In September 2014, Pieology expanded into the state of Minnesota, opening a location in Mankato with the assistance of Minnesota Vikings offensive tackle Matt Kalil as the local franchise owner. During the same month, Pieology expanded into the state of Arizona, opening a location in Tucson. By October 2014, the company had 35 units in eight states. In 2015, Pieology was the fastest growing restaurant chain in America, according to data from Technomic. In March 2016, Pieology expanded into the state of Hawaii, opening a location in Aina Haina with the help of franchise partner Cotti Foods. In May 2016, Pieology opened its first location outside the continental United States in the city of Tamuning in the American territory of Guam with the help of a local franchise partner. In 2016, Pieology received an investment from Andrew and Peggy Cherng, the founders of Panda Restaurant Group. Later in that year, Pieology acquired one of its rivals, Project Pie. In July 2018, Pieology closed 3 of its Southern California locations in Woodland Hills, Westlake Village, and Thousand Oaks. =International expansion= In January 2018, Pieology opened their first location outside of the United States in the Polanco neighborhood of Mexico City with the help of Mexican franchise partner OPFRA S.A. de C.V. Later that year, Pieology announced plans to expand into Spain with a focus towards a franchise model.

D. Considine in his review of Rubber Rodeo's 1984 album Scenic Views. Although the term was coined in the 1980s, its usage since that time has been varied.As a description of pop ballads used in cowboy films, see *As a description of soft rock performers who employed cowboy aesthetics in their music, see In the late 2010s, the term began to be used to describe country-influenced indie rock and indie pop bands.  History  The music of alt= = Pop ballads in western films = Following Considine's coining of the term \\"cowboy pop\\" in the 1980s, the term was used retrospectively to describe a broad range of music recorded throughout the 20th century. In the early 2000s, music journalists such as Barry Mazor, John T. Davis, and Richard Carlin began to describe pop ballads used in western films as cowboy pop. Barry Mazor called Jimmy Wakely a \\"cowboy pop singer\\" and argued that \\"when singing cowboy movies ruled, Hollywood hardly made a distinction between the sounds of cowboy pop balladeers and another sound entirely, born in Texas, in which Jimmie Rodgers had a formative role.\\" As an actor and cowboy pop balladeer, Wakely sang in many of the western films in which he appeared, such as Riders of the Dawn and Silver Trails. Similarly, John T. Davis called Marty Robbins a \\"cowboy pop balladeer,\\" who would later act and provide music for western films such as Gun of a Stranger. Marty Robbins' 1959 song \\"El Paso\\" was featured on Cowboy Pop, a 2011 compilation released by Ling Music Group. Similar to Jimmy Wakely and Marty Robbins, Wilf Carter's 1949 recording \\"Bluebird on Your Windowsill\\" was described by Richard Carlin as \\"the kind of cowboy pop that is treasured as a kitsch classic.\\" Wilf Carter's songs were also used to score cowboy films, such as John Ford's 1939 Stagecoach. Though these popular cowboy singers preceded the coining of the term cowboy pop by music journalist J. D. Considine, they have been identified in retrospect for their singing of pop ballads in the context of western films. = Soft rock of the '70s and '80s = Beyond the early pop balladry of cowboy singers like Jimmy Wakely, Marty Robbins, and Wilf Carter, the term cowboy pop has also been used to describe soft rock performers from the 1970s and 1980s who embodied cowboy aesthetics in their music, such as Michael Martin Murphey and Alex Harvey. Stereo Review referred to Michael Martin Murphey as a cowboy pop singer and JazzTimes similarly referred to Alex Harvey's 1971 song \\"Rings\\" as cowboy pop. In December 1974, soft rock singer Paul Davis released the song \\"Ride em Cowboy,\\" which peaked at #4 on Billboard's Pop-Standard Singles and #27 on the Hot 100. In the context of baroque pop music, Van Dyke Parks' employed cowboy aesthetics in his 1989 song \\"Cowboy,\\" which The Wire described as \\"a complex narrative about Hawaii and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour.\\" Parks went on to produce Utah Carol's \\"Cowboy Pop Song\\" in 2001.  2010s  In the late 2010s, the term cowboy pop began to be used to describe several country- influenced indie rock and indie pop bands in New York City. Some associated groups include Babies' Babies, Baby Jey, Cut Worms, Dark Tea, Dougie Poole, New Love Crowd, Sam Evian, Widowspeak, and Wilder Maker, several of whom have performed together.For Cut Worms and Sam Evian, see *For Dark Tea, Dougie Poole, and Babies' Babies, see *For Babies' Babies and Dark Tea, see *For Dougie Poole and New Love Crowd, see *For Dark Tea, Baby Jey, New Love Crowd, and Babies' Babies, see *For Cut Worms and Widowspeak, see *For Sam Evian and Wilder Maker, see In 2015, Stereogum described Wilder Maker's music as \\"cowboy pop that‚Äôs got one eye wandering toward outlaw territory and one fixed on catchy melodies.\\" The influence of outlaw country was similarly noted by New Commute, which described Dougie Poole's music as an \\"intersection of experimental pop and outlaw country.\\" London in Stereo called Widowspeak's 2017 release Expect the Best an \\"accomplished album that would fit snugly in a cowboy pop genre.\\" In a 2018 interview, Baby Jey cited influences such as Prince and 1980s country singers Tanya Tucker, Keith Whitley, and Johnny Lee, giving further context to the development of contemporary cowboy pop. As of 2018, the music blog aggregator Hype Machine employs the term cowboy pop as a music genre.

In 1946 he was elected honorary president of the Polish Pedological Society. Professor Miklaszewski was very active in the scientific, didactic, organizational and publishing fields. He created the original Polish school of soil science, equilibrating the geologico-substancional intellectual tradition of Albrecht Thaer and Frederic Fallou and the new Russian genetico-typological school of Vasily Dokuchaev. He was describing the soil as the product of oro-hydrographic, climatic, and geologic conditions of the country in which it occurs. In this spirit he created original The outline of preliminary classification of Polish soils dividing all soils into three basic groups: silicate soils, calcic soils and humus soils. His soil classification was used in Poland till 50. of XX c. and influenced next editions of Polish Soil Classification. His most important publications are: Soil Map of the Kingdom of Poland 1:500 000 (1907)-the world's first soil map covering such a large area witch such accurancy; Soil Map of Lithuania (1924) and Soil Map of Poland (1927) 1:500 000 as well as manuals and monographs Recognition of Soils in Poland and Soils of Poland.

It was designed by James McDonald and built from 1854 to 1872. It is also known as Blake Vale. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Ewenton's land (a larger section bounded by Adolphus Street in the west, Darling Street in the north, Johnston's Bay in the south and Sandy Bay in the east) was bought at auction in 1837 by Robert Blake, from Professor Gilchrist. Blake was Quartermaster Sergeant in His Majesty's 17th Regiment of Foot soldiers, who chose a civil career instead. He was appointed to the NSW Sheriff's Office in 1835, and made under sheriff of the colony on 1 July 1837. Blake's scheme on his estate was to build a number of houses one at a time on varying sized blocks of his land to bring in rental income, along with Darling Street buildings.Reynolds, 1986 Ewenton's house was originally constructed for Robert Blake in 1854‚Äì1855 as \\"Blake Vale\\", a simple single-storied colonial house with a part basement (probably with an attic roof) on the Johnston's Bay side of the property. Blake moved in in December 1854 after the birth of his first son, D'Arcy Stephen, who died on 12 June 1855 at seven months. Blake sold the property in October 1856, moving back to (another of his houses) Mount Shamrock (8, 8a Ewenton Street). The property was bought in 1856 by Major Ewen Wallace Cameron, a successful businessman and partner in Thomas Sutcliffe Mort & Co. in charge of wool consignments, squatting accounts and pastoral finance. Cameron also bought other adjoining properties off Blake (with his fluctuating finances) in 1860 and 1861. The 13 lots were entered from Darling Street, Adolphus Street and the entry roadway called Wallscourt Avenue. The name became Ewenton Street after Cameron bought Blake Vale. Blake had only created one other road, Blake Street. 9 of Cameron's 12 children to his wife Sophia Usher (b. 1830 in Mauritius, of a father said to have been secretary to Lord Minto, former Governor-General of India) were born at Ewenton. Mrs Cameron's origins and possible exotic tastes may explain the style of the upper floor bay window. In 1860 to accommodate his growing family Cameron engaged Balmain architect James McDonald to add an elaborate entrance portico and stone upper storey with slate roof to Blake Vale, with bayed and pedimented windows in Victorian Simplified Classical style, providing panoramic views of the city of Sydney. It seems that the ground floor and basement incorporated Blake Vale. Cameron named the house \\"Ewenton\\". The upper storey had a bay window of singular appearance. The new addition contained two large rooms with views of the bay: three smaller rooms were located above the entrance side of the house. The house was substantially extended in different stages 1860 & 1872\\\\. The architect for stages 2 & 3 (1860, 1872) was James McDonald, (1814-1902). The 1872 extensions (a three-storey wing in stone with slate roof, with basement on the south side of the house) to accommodate Cameron's growing family were in a robust high Victorian style. The massive stone four-storey exterior is heavily articulated in a flat bas-relief decoration around the windows. The high quality stonework has unusual detailing, heavily outlined window openings with curious tops, not like anything from McDonald's other work, and possibly influenced by the Cameron family's travels overseas (in 1886-8). Although the continuous window sills can be found in McDonald's other work in Balmain, the stone window architraves and centre-holed \\"top knots\\" are extremely rare in Australian architecture Ewenton was entered through impressive gates at the end of Blake Street. Carriages turned south inside the gates and followed a high level driveway around the south side of the house to stables and coach house on the lower part of the site. A sharp turn back near the 1872 wing allowed carriages to arrive at the portico. Pedestrian access was down a flight of steps in line with the main gate then by curving path to the entrance portico. Steps and a central path, at right angles to the house, led back up the driveway. Cameron retained McDonald to see to the driveway, erection of retaining walls, and general ground improvements. A photograph after 1872 showed Cameron also had a wharf, slipway and boatshed below. The house is of post-Colonial, Italianate classical and rustic Italianate styles in parts. Cameron died at Ewenton in 1876. By the terms of his will the house remained the family home and rental properties were to be sold off. His widow Sophia died in 1878. The older daughters had all reached 21 before the property settlement took place in 1878. Including reclamation of the waterfront the total property now measured a little more than 9 acres. The Cameron trustees subdivided the land into two sections, one either side of Ewenton Street. They had gained permission from the Hunt family to extend Ewenton Street south to join Grafton Street, making access south to houses more easy and making the Cameron lots more attractive for sale. New streets with family names were created on the Cameron land: Wallace and Charles Street. Not counting Ewenton's own land, Section A east of Ewenton Street was divided into four lots to contain houses already built by Blake: Shannon Grove, Mt. Shamrock, Maryville, Wallscourt Lodge, and a fifth lot being the latter's front garden. Land to the west of Ewenton Street also went on the market, along with other Cameron lands, in all the estate encompassing \\"13 family residences and shops\\", ten acres of unsubdivided land on Iron Cove and four acres at Taylor's Bay, Bradley's Head. Johanna Cameron, wife of John Cameron, commission agent, bought Ewenton in March 1879. John Cameron (not a son of E. W. Cameron) was mayor of Balmain in 1883 and 1884 and lived at Shannon Grove until the end of the 1880s. After the Trustees sold off the lots in sections A & B, Ewenton still remained the family home for a few years. Following Sophia's death, daughter Barbara Nail cared for the family. In 1880 eldest son George became the head of the family. Mrs Nail died in 1890 at Ewenton, aged 78. That year the surviving Camerons moved to Lerna, 1 Ballast Point Road, home of daughter Julian (third child) and her husband John Waugh. Ewenton was left vacant in 1891 but in 1892 Mrs Stainger converted it to a boarding house and was there until 1893. It was empty for a couple of years until 1896 when the Bethany Deaconess Institution took occupancy. John Harper was there from 1897 to 1898, George Lawson from 1899 to 1905, and Madame Bovin from 1906 to 1913. Sitting on just under 2 acres, Ewenton was conveyed to Walter Henry Holt, squatter, Queensland, and Alfred Edmund Jaques, Sydney solicitor, in 1886. A number of transfers of title followed in 1891 and 1896. It became a family home again when sold to Henry Brisbane Swan of Swan Brothers, timber merchants of Abattoir Road (now Lilyfield Road), Rozelle in 1911. The increasing pollution of Rozelle Bay by the Glebe Island abattoir, impending reclamation of the bay and resumption of Swan's original timber yard there for the Rozelle goods railway, were probably factors in his decision to buy Ewenton. He expanded his business by opening a timber yard on the waterfront (later Grafton Street), south of Ewenton, in 1913. Swan was fastidious and saw to it that the yard and Ewenton's garden were kept quite separate. He moored his sailing and motor boats at the foot of the garden. Swan was the mayor of Balmain in 1893, 1894 and 1914‚Äì1915. The garden had a well sited in the \\"top garden\\" on the entrance side of the house, at the foot of a great English oak tree. The well was lined with stone, and was very likely a survivor of the Blake Vale days. He and his wife lived in the 1860s wing, keeping the 1872 wing as studies, one on each of the three levels. The old kitchen area and butler's pantry in the basement of the 1860 wing had become a cellar. The long row of servant bells and cords could still be seen in the 1920s. Son Lyle was a barrister, but took over the timber business on his father's death in 1926. Lyle was mayor of Balmain in 1929‚Äì1931. The Swan family were to own Ewenton until 1950. In 1951 it was purchased by Dickson Primer & Co., P/L, who expanded Swan's timber business on the property. Dickson Primer built a large shed alongside Ewenton and used the house as a store building. Its condition deteriorated. The site was rezoned residential in 1980. In 1980 after neglect and vandalism (the bay window and verandah were demolished, cedar joinery and fittings plundered) the house caught fire, gutting the 1850s section and partially destroying the roof. The 1872 section was saved by prompt local fire brigade action. Following a long period (when it was used as an industrial and storage site (the house was used for storing records), 1960-1981) as a derelict industrial site, it was restored as a residence in 1985, as part of the Cameron's Cove redevelopment. The remaining grounds including several Victorian-period trees (figs and camphor laurels), some early 20th-century retaining walls and paths, were conserved and landscaped. The bay window was reinstated, based on historic photographs and analysis. The portico, verandah and other details were carefully conserved. In 1985 a four-lot subdivision was approved by Leichhardt Council, along with partial refurbishment of the house, demolition of the factory building and erection of 60 townhouses, Cameron's Cove. The property was bought by Brydeen P/L (now the Australian Centre for Languages) in 1987, which applied for alterations and additions for use as a school. This was refused by Leichhardt Council, appealed to the Land & Environment Court, and the appeal discontinued in 1989. Dr John and Susan Yiannikas bought Ewenton in 1991 and following extensive works to the house they concentrated their efforts on the creation of a garden. Modifications to the garaging, drive and entrance made the house functional, and provided deep beds for bold plantings, creating a wonderful sense of place. A mass of understorey planting of exotic sub-tropical perennials and heritage shrubs complements the mature camphor laurel trees. Originally planted by gardener and passionate tropical plant enthusiast Brendan Lewis. The garden in its current form is derived from the environmental factors the landscape now faces and the desire to have a garden suited to the period of its architecture. The garden's current direction is due to the collaborative efforts of the owners and landscape designer Myles Baldwin. Baldwin trained at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney and was head gardener at Bronte House. Interior refurbishment, further exterior restoration, installation of a basement (interior) swimming pool, and erection of a re-used Victorian gazebo in the garden, were approved in 1992. In 1998 a new 2 car garage and basement storage area (converted to a swimming pool), a re-used (i.e. relocated) Victorian gazebo in the garden and new sandstone driveway following the general arrangement of the Victorian driveway were approved and built near the southern end of the 1872 wing, off Grafton Lane.  Description  =House= The house was originally constructed in 1854‚Äì1855 and substantially extended in different stages from 1860 to 1872, and is of post-Colonial, Italianate classical and rustic Italianate styles, with unusually interesting sandstone detailing.LEP, 2013 The house reflects the various periods of construction and styles, including Georgian (1854), Victorian Classical Italianate (1860) and Victorian Rustic Italianate (1872). It presents as a three and four storey sandstone building to the east, water frontage. Significant features include the third storey oriel bay window, decorative timber verandah and arched windows. Two storey (plus attic and basement) large building with hipped and gable ended slate roof has a number of eclectic features such as bay window and verandah. The house consists of Post-Colonial, Italianate classical and rustic Italianate styles in parts. A three-storey south wing with basement is totally different to the north wing. Built in high quality stonework with unusual detailing such as heavily outlined window openings and continuous window sills. String courses boldly define the different storeys and express the diminished thickness of the stone walls as the building rises. The first and second levels feature small narrow arched double hung windows with a center-holed \\"top knot\\"at the top of the gable end. The verandah extends across the basement level. Above, on the ground floor level the verandah extends across the facade and changes height at the heavily moulded arches of the door openings, with a double- arched curved corrugated steel roof over. The fascias of the arcaded verandah are perforated and the roof is supported on timber columns with Corinthian capitals. A criss-cross balustrade is common to both verandahs. The first floor level east facade of the north wing has a central projecting oriel bay window with a separate conical shaped roof with large windows on either side with curved pediment type mouldings above. Entry to the house is on the western facade. There are tall cast iron gates at the end of Blake Street. Pedestrian access is down a flight of stairs in line with the main gate then by a curving path to the entrance portico. Steps and a central path, at right angles to the house, lead back up the driveway. A long driveway leads down to the separate garage building. The east side of the house overlooks the Ewenton Park and the Harbour. =Garden= Ewenton is set amongst established gardens and features significant camphor laurel trees on the west of the house as well as sandstone retaining walls, gate potss and paths. The original (or early) and current main entry is off Blake Street, where the original sandstone gate posts remain and a section of iron picket fencing with forged spears set in a masonry base. The gates are modern. The original (or early) iron picket gates have been relocated within the property's garden.Rice, 2010, 12 The house's eastern front is clearly visible from adjacent Ewenton Park, facing Sydney Harbour.Rice, 2010, 14 The current owners since 1991 and extensive works to the house concentrated their efforts on the creation of a garden. Modifications to the garaging, drive and entrance made the house functional, and provided deep beds for bold plantings, creating a wonderful sense of place. The garden in its current form is derived from the environmental factors the landscape now faces and the desire to have a garden suited to the period of its architecture. Entering from Blake Street, through gates that now sit in the location of the original grand entrance, you enter what appears less like Balmain and more like a private parkland. The drive turns hard right inside the gates and follows a line set by Ewenton's original architect James McDonald. Mature camphor laurel trees (Cinnamomum camphora) bathe the drive and garden with filtered light and a hint of the harbour can be seen through their branches. A mass of understorey planting of exotic sub-tropical perennials and heritage shrubs complements these trees. Originally planted by gardener and passionate tropical plant enthusiast Brendan Lewis, the palette of plants is extremely suited to life under the competitive camphor laurels. As a boundary planting Lewis used shell ginger (Alpinia zerumbet), propagated from tubers he found when clearing out decades of overgrown bamboo, privet and rubbish. The white flowers provide screening from fencing while creating a sense of depth. In the body of the garden Lewis combined drifts of shade- tolerant and flowering semi-hardwood perennials Mackaya bella and giant fan palms (Chamaedorea costaricana) and a purple form of Ctenanthe setosa. Lower on the slope these plantings are also bolstered by clumps of giant bird-of- paradise flower (Strelitzia nicolai), Justicia sp. and more ginger. Recent plantings in the drive garden include masses of Hydrangea and specimen plantings of Camellia japonica, angel's trumpets (Brugmansia cv.s), sweet viburnum and evergreen magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), to add colour, seasonal variation and permanency to perennial drifts and palms. Although not the original driveway surface but built in the same location, the drive passes through the garden and feels more of the garden than a thoroughfare. At a junction in the drive adjacent to a contemporary garage designed by architect Peter Tonkin, the site's steepness becomes a significant feature. A large floating boulder opposite the garage supports a lead-roofed pavilion also designed by Tonkin for the Yiannidises. Footing it is a mass display of Philodendron x \\"Xanadu\\", a clipped Japanese box hedge and a collection of Agave attenuata. Around the pavilion plantings of cape leadwort (Plumbago capensis), Viburnum, bird-of-paradise flower (Strelitzia reginae) and day lilies (Hemerocallis cv.s) grow under a black locust (Robinia). A circular garden supporting an urn and bordered with a dense collection of low and ground-cover perennials including beefsteak plant (Iresine herbstii), spike flower (Plectranthus ciliatus), Ctenanthe, Mercury Bay weed (Dichondra repens) marks the top of the steps to the front door and access to the lower garden. Nearby a large stone bench is a feature, built from remains of an old wall demolished elsewhere on the property. New plantings of evergreen magnolia and Camellia have been planted around the bench and adjacent beds. At entry level to the house a steep bank of Mexican lilies (Beschorneria yuccoides), grey sage (Salvia leucantha), green Ctenanthe, ornamental wandering Jew and rock roses (Cistus sp.) dotted with feature Michelia sp., dwarf date palms (Phoenix roebelenii) and pink angel's trumpets (Brugmansia cv.) provide colour and texture viewed from the house. Two traveller's palms (Ravenala sp.) supported by fruit salad plant (Monstera deliciosa), several Brazilian red cloaks and a frangipani (Plumeria rubra cv.) give interest. The path leads around the house's southern side. Below the garage is the garden shed and compost area, hidden behind dwarf palms (Rhapis excelsa), ornamental bananas (Musa ornata) and a large drift of ginger which screens areas below and the adjoining residence. The walk down this side of the house is made from recycled sandstone details collected by the owners. Adjacent to this, past troughts of rabbit's foot ferns the basement stone works contrast with timber steps added by the Yiannikas' and the edge of the harbour-front verandah, designed by Clive Lucas, replacing the original that had long ago been removed. On Ewenton's eastern side the garden opens up and reveals its relationship to the harbour. Once the home of a sloped garden path to a reclaimed lower paddock and boat house, the older landscape has been transformed over the years to become a purposeful lawn, and the publicly accessible Ewenton Park, maintained by the Inner West Council. A mature Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla), once part of Ewenton's garden and visible in photographs from 1872, is still here today offering protection from southerly winds and the view to White Bay wharves. Bordering the lawn to the south, Philodendron x \\"Xanadu\\" forms a carpet that rises up to a collection of Cordyline stricta, beehive gingers and rare Thai blue ginger (Dichorisandra thyrsiflora), under the shade of mature evergreen alders. Adjacent to the house are three clumps of Alexandra palms (Archontophoenix alexandrae). = Modifications and dates = * 1827+: site probably used as a quarry for stone to build a number of Blake's houses in the area. * 1854-5: Blake Vale built, 1860 & 1872 extended as Ewenton * 1892-1913: boarding house use * 1950+: industrial use with adjacent shed, and house used as a store, neglected * 1980: fire damage * 1986: Exterior restored * 1992: exterior restoration, installation of basement (interior) swimming pool, erection of a re-used Victorian gazebo in the garden. * 1998: a new 2 car garage and basement storage area and new sandstone driveway following the general arrangement of the Victorian driveway were built near the southern end of the 1872 wing.  Heritage listing  Ewenton has historic and aesthetic heritage significance in its external fabric and waterfront setting as one of the very few large Victorian waterfront estates in Balmain which remain largely intact, and demonstrate the changing tastes of the Victorian era. The house was originally constructed in 1854‚Äì1855 and substantially extended in different stages from 1860 to 1872, and is of post-Colonial, Italianate classical and rustic Italianate styles, with unusually interesting sandstone detailing. It retains the core part of its grounds including several Victorian-period trees (including three camphor laurels), some early 20th- century retaining walls and paths. The property has historic significance for its association with Major Ewen Wallace Cameron, partner in Thomas Sutcliffe Mort & Co., and one of Balmain's leading citizens, and architect (of 1860 and 1872 additions) James McDonald, early Balmain identity.National Trust, 1981, Salwell, 1982, modified, Read, S., 2005 Ewenton was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Originally constructed for use by the Republic of China Air Force, it was the largest airport in China when opened in 1935. The airport was destroyed during the Second Sino-Japanese War and rebuilt afterwards. After 1949, it was mainly used for test flights by the aircraft manufacturer Hongdu Aviation Industry Group, until its replacement by Nanchang Yaohu Airport in 2018. Location and facilities The airport is located in Qingyunpu District of Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi Province, China. It has a cement runway that is long and wide, capable of handling Boeing 737 and similar aircraft. Its elevation is above sea level. History =Republic of China= Qingyunpu Airport, originally called Sanjiadian Airport, was built for Chiang Kai-shek's Encirclement Campaigns against the Chinese Soviet Republic, the rebel communist base in southern Jiangxi. Laoyingfang Airport was originally used for that purpose, but its proximity to the city center impeded frequent military operations by the 250 war planes based there. In September 1933, Chiang ordered the construction of Sanjiadian Airport in Qingyunpu, then in the far outskirts of Nanchang, and mobilized 290,000 labourers from 83 counties of Jiangxi Province. Construction officially began on 1 August 1934, and the airport was opened in the spring of 1935. At the time it was the largest airport in China, proclaimed to be the \\"No. 1 airport in the Far East\\". It was then often referred to as the New Nanchang Airport. In 1933, Chiang Kai-shek signed an agreement with Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini to establish a joint venture in China to manufacture airplanes. The company, called Sino-Italian National Aircraft Works (SINAW), was established in 1934 in Nanchang, with factories located at both Sanjiadian and Laoyingfang airports. It became the predecessor of Hongdu Aviation Industry Group, one of China's major aircraft manufacturers. After the outbreak of the Second Sino- Japanese War in 1937, SINAW factories were severely damaged by Japanese aerial bombing. During a bombing of Qingyunpu on 22 December 1937, 9 Imperial Japanese Navy fighter aircraft led by Shiota Ry≈çhei flying out of recently- captured Nanking and escorting 12 IJN bombers were intercepted by Chinese Air Force fighters; Shiota Ry≈çhei (ÊΩÆÁî∞ËâØÂπ≥) himself was shot down and killed by Xu Baodi (ÂæêËëÜÁïá), a pilot of the 5th Pursuit Group flying a Polikarpov I-15 acquired by the Chinese under the new Sino-Soviet Treaty to counter Imperial Japanese aggressions.https://www.ncnews.com.cn/xwzx/ncxw/lnc/201912/t20191218_1514702.html The Soviet Union dispatched a volunteer air force to Qingyunpu Airport to help China fight the Japanese. Captain Anton Alekseyevich Gubenko and Major Liu Zhesheng among others all shot down Japanese bogeys during a major air battle over Nanchang on 26 June 1938.http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/china_chi- sheng.htmhttp://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/soviet_gubenko.htm The airport was destroyed as a result of the prolonged fighting and attrition from 1937 into mid-1939, and was rebuilt after the end of the war in 1945. =People's Republic of China= After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the airport was renovated and used for aircraft testing by Hongdu Machinery Factory (now Hongdu Aviation). From March 1981 to early 1982, when the runway of Nanchang Xiangtang Airport was being improved, Qingyunpu temporarily served as Nanchang's public airport for nine months. With the expansion of the city of Nanchang, Qingyunpu Airport became surrounded by the increasingly urban Qingyunpu District and restricted its development. Several major thoroughfares are cut off by the airport, causing Qingyunpu to be known as the most congested district of Nanchang. On 23 December 2009, the Jiangxi provincial government reached an agreement with Aviation Industry Corporation of China, the parent company of Hongdu Aviation, to build the new Yaohu Airport in the Nanchang Aviation Industrial City to replace Qingyunpu Airport. Construction for Yaohu Airport began in November 2016, and it was opened on 16 August 2018. Qingyunpu Airport is expected to close by the end of 2018.

They arrived aboard the Nuestra Se√±ora de Buena Esperanza, which had sailed from Portuguese Macao, as part of the Manila galleon trade. During about three days of travels ashore around Morro Bay, the crew of the Nuestra Se√±ora de Buena Esperanza came in contact with the Chumash people, ultimately resulting in the deaths of two crew members: one Spaniard and one Filipino. Departing Morro Bay after the deaths of the crew members, the Nuestra Se√±ora de Buena Esperanza eventually reached its intended destination of Acapulco. No other Filipino landed in California until 1595. In 1995, a monument on Morro Bay was dedicated to commemorate the events of 1587. October has been designated as Filipino American History Month since 2009 in recognition of these events. Background Thousands of years before their first contact with Europeans, the Chumash people established the region around the Channel Islands and areas from San Luis Obispo to Malibu as their territories. At the beginning of the 16th century, European explorers began to explore the Pacific. The Spanish traveled westward with Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa, first seeing the Pacific Ocean from Panama; then the Pacific was crossed by Ferdinand Magellan, who reached the Philippines. The Chumash's first contact with Europeans occurred on 10 October 1542, when Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo's expedition sailed into the area. Their next contact with Europeans would be 45 years later. Beginning in the mid-16th century, Spain conducted its campaign to conquer the Philippines, led by Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi. This concluded with Spanish forces repelling Chinese ambitions to control Manila. As a consequence of the conquest of the Philippines, in 1565 the Manila galleon trade began, sailing from Acapulcoinitially to Cebu, and after 1571 to Manila. These ships were crewed largely by Filipinos, or \\"Indios Luzones\\" as they were known at the time. The Filipinos who sailed experienced arduous conditions, poor rations, disease, and the lowest pay among the crew. From 1582 until his death in 1586, Francisco Gali plied the Manila galleon route, initially as a navigator. On a return voyage to Mexico in 1584, Gali navigated the ship he was in to a high latitude, which brought the ship along the North American coast, which Gali had thought was astride the Strait of Ani√°n. In 1585, a mission from Archbishop Pedro Moya de Contreras to survey the Californian coast, and to avoid China, was given to the westward-bound captain of the Manila galleon, who at that time was Gali. Gali died in Manila later that year, leaving the mission to one Pedro de Unamuno. Unamuno, who had sailed with Gali from Acapulco, had been paid by merchants there to acquire goods in China. Upon reaching Macao, Portuguese authorities seized his two galleons, leaving him and his crew trapped in China. Hearing of this, the Real Audiencia of Manila sought the arrest of Unamuno for disobeying the instructions to avoid China. Fortunately for Unamuno, who could have received the death penalty for his insubordination, Franciscans who wanted to return to Mexico provided funds to purchase a ship, a fragata, which was christened the Nuestra Se√±ora de Buena Esperanza. One of those Franciscans was Mart√≠n Ignacio de Loyola; another person who came aboard for the eastward journey was a Japanese boy. Leaving the Far East in mid-July 1587, the Nuestra Se√±ora de Buena Esperanza sailed eastward across the Pacific Ocean for a largely uneventful trip. In early September, the ship was damaged when the \\"masts were sprung\\", or cracked. More than a month later, the ship spotted land through a fog, and fires were seen onshore. Initial reconnaissance led to the discovery of Morro Bay, which had resources that could replenish the ship's provisions; there were also trees which could be utilized for masts. When people were observed on a hill looking at their ship, it was decided that a landing party should go ashore and claim the bay. Landing On 18 October, the feast day of San Lucas, the initial landing parties came ashore. One party consisted of Unamuno and a dozen soldiers. Another party of \\"Luzon Indians\\" and a priest; the priest was Father Mart√≠n Ignacio de Loyola, nephew of Ignatius of Loyola. Two of the Filipinos went ahead of the parties, scouting for the locals observed from the ship. Initial attempts to make contact with local people were unsuccessful. When a group of nine Native Americans was observed; they ran off before the landing party could attempt to communicate with them. After taking possession of the land by placing a cross atop a hill as a sign of their claim, the landing party returned to the ship. After a second landing the next day for exploration and the gathering of supplies for the ship, the landing party spent the night ashore. The next morning, part of the landing party was approached by 23 Native Americans, who ended up taking clothing and canteens from the landing party. Not long after, an attempt to capture Loyola was stopped when a gun was fired. Afterwards, the landing party began to return to their ship and was attacked, resulting in the deaths of one Spaniard and one Filipino, both due to javelin wounds, and several others being injured. Reinforced by a complement from the ship, the group repelled the attack. The next day, the 21 October, the galleon departed, continuing its journey to Acapulco. Aftermath Looking roughly westward, the foreground has the back of the FANHS historic landmark, with Morro Rock in the background. Located in Coleman Park, on the north part of Morro Bay. After departing Morro Bay, the Nuestra Se√±ora de Buena Esperanza sailed southward. It was a few days behind the Santa Ana, which had sailed eastward at a lower latitude and was captured by privateer Thomas Cavendish, a fate which the Nuestra Se√±ora de Buena Esperanza avoided. Attempts to sail southward along the coastline were made difficult due to poor weather, including fog. More than a month after departing Morro Bay, the Nuestra Se√±ora de Buena Esperanza arrived at Acapulco. Inland expeditions were prohibited by the Spanish authorities following the hostility encountered at Morro Bay. After its initial voyage across the Pacific, the Nuestra Se√±ora de Buena Esperanza continued to be utilized in the Manila galleon trade, but was lost off the coast of Negros Island in 1647. The next documented landing of Filipinos in California was in November 1595, when the Manila galleon San Agustin was wrecked at Point Reyes, the first European ship to be wrecked on the California coast. Unlike the interaction of the crew of the Nuestra Se√±ora de Buena Esperanza with the local people, the encounter of the San Agust√≠n with the Coast Miwok did not result in any deaths. Following the wrecking of the San Agustin, which resulted in several deaths, the crew departed in a salvaged launch and reached Acapulco. As late as the Portol√† expedition in 1769‚Äì1770, the Chumash maintained a large population. However, by the 1910 United States Census, fewer than one hundred remained. One reason for the reduction of their population was the introduction of Old World diseases. including pleuropneumonia and smallpox. The discovery of \\"Puerto San Lucas\\" by the crew of the galleon was recorded in the log of the voyage. However, the discovery faded into obscurity, until 1929 when the log was translated into English, and published by the California Historical Society. Before then it was believed that Unamuno had sailed into Monterey Bay; another early 20th century source pointed towards Cape Mendocino or San Francisco Bay. More recently, the precise location of where the landing occurred has been disputed, citing inaccurate navigation tools and presumptions in past writings of the event. The 1587 event marks the first documentated instance of Asians in what is now California, or anywhere in what is now the United States, North America, the Americas. The landing of the first Filipinos at Morro Bay, which occurred 33 years before the events at Plymouth Rock, is often overlooked, even by Filipino Americans. For instance, the Filipinos who landed in 1587 have been described as \\"invading troops\\", and more focus is placed on Filipino immigration to the United States during, and after, the American period. Although the landing was an important milestone, it would not be until the latter half of the 18th century that Filipinos began to settle in what would become part of the continental United States. Beginning in 1992, the Filipino American National Historical Society (FANHS) began efforts to commemorate the landing. On 21 October 1995, with the mayor of Morro Bay in attendance, a monument was placed at Morro Bay to commemorate the events of 1587. The monument was placed in Coleman Park. By 2009, after follow-up efforts by FANHS, Filipino American History Month was recognized by California, as well as nationally by resolutions in state and national legislatures; it occurs every October, in recognition of the landing at Morro Bay.

Life and family Bernard Wood was born into a prominent Christchurch business family. His grandfather, William Derisley Wood (1824‚Äì1904), founded Wood Bros flour mills in Christchurch. Bernard‚Äôs father, William Wood (1858‚Äì1921), one of six brothers, founded William Wood and Company in the 1890s, which Bernard took over after his father‚Äôs death. William Wood and Company was a trading and manufacturing company dealing mostly in agricultural produce and machinery. Bernard Wood attended Christ's College, Christchurch. In December 1913 he married Eileen Ward (1886‚Äì1952), daughter of Sir Joseph Ward, who had been New Zealand's Prime Minister from 1906 to 1912. The wedding took place at the Basilica, Wellington. The MP Tom Seddon was best man, and the reception was held at the house of his mother, the widow of the former Prime Minister Richard Seddon. Bernard and Eileen had four children, of whom two boys died of illness in March 1925. When her mother, Lady Ward, died in 1927, Eileen became Sir Joseph‚Äôs hostess during his final years in politics, including his return to the premiership from 1928 to 1930. Cricket career After successful seasons with St Albans in the Christchurch competition, Wood played his first first- class match for Canterbury on 1 January 1908, scoring a century on debut against Wellington. In the first innings, opening the Canterbury batting, he put on a partnership of 141 for the first wicket with Billy Patrick and 112 for the second wicket with Dan Reese, and finished with 108. It was the only century of the match. A contemporary account noted his mastery over the bowling and the strength of his driving. The Canterbury Cricket Association presented him with a bat in recognition of his innings, which was Canterbury‚Äôs only first-class century of the season. However, he had little further success at first-class level until his last match, 11 years later, when he scored 95 (the highest score of the match) and 25 against Auckland to help Canterbury retain the Plunket Shield in 1918-19. This time he played \\"orthodox strokes all round the wicket\\" while his teammates had trouble countering the spin bowling of Sydney Smith. He played his later club cricket with East Christchurch. Golf career For a few years Wood gave up playing cricket to concentrate on golf. He was New Zealand Amateur Golf Champion in 1912 and 1913, and runner-up in the 1912 New Zealand Open. He was a member of the Christchurch Golf Club teams that won the nationally contested O‚ÄôRorke Challenge Vase in 1910, 1912 and 1921. The B B Wood Memorial Trophy is contested annually at the Christchurch Golf Club.

The first bridge, a wooden structure, was built in 1860 for the Kongsvinger Line. The municipalities of Fet and H√∏land split the cost of a road for horses and carts on the downstream side of the bridge. In 1877 the bridge was rebuilt, and the wooden pilings were replaced with stone. The construction of the bridge led to the Bingen Booms at S√∏rumsand being relocated to Fetsund. After some time, it turned out that the old bridge could lead to large flows of timber clogging when being driven on the river. This led to the construction of a new and higher bridge a few dozen meters upstream from the old wooden bridge. The new railway bridge was made of steel with seven spans, each approximately long. This bridge, with a length of , was opened in 1919. This was built as a combined rail and road bridge with a lane on either side. When a new road bridge was later built, the roadways on the 1919 bridge were closed to cars in 1959, and the upstream roadway was converted to use as a walking and cycling route. In the 1980s, both roadways were removed and a narrow footbridge was installed on the north side. This marked the end of one of the last combined rail and road bridges in Norway. To protect the approach to the old railway bridge, the Fetsund Battery was installed on the slope west of the bridge in 1898. After the Second World War, a prefabricated pontoon bridge was stored at Stasjonsstranda, between the bridges, for many years. The New Fetsund Bridge for National Road 22 was opened on December 12, 1959 a few hundred meters downstream from the railway bridge.

O. Carpenter (born Aurelius O. Carpenter) (1836-1919) was an American photographer, writer and abolitionist. He was one of the earliest photographers in early American California, photographing Mendocino County, California. He was the son of Clarina I. H. Nichols and the father of Grace Carpenter Hudson and Grant Carpenter. Prior to moving to California, he was active in the abolitionist movement, fighting with John Brown in the Battle of Black Jack. Life Aurelius Carpenter was born in 1836 in Vermont. His mother was Clarina I. H. Nichols. As a teenager, he had an apprenticeship at the Windham County Democrat, the newspaper owned by his stepfather, George Nichols. In 1854 (or 1855), Carpenter, his mother, and his brother, Chapin, left Vermont to Kansas to support abolitionist activities. Carpenter joined abolitionist John Brown on June 2, 1856, fighting in the Battle of Black Jack. Carpenter married writer and photographer Helen McCowan in late 1856. He had met McCowan while he was recovering from injuries sustained during the battle and she had served as Carpenter's nurse. He headed further west with Helen, to California. Helen's family had moved to California, where her brother joined the mining industry. The couple settled in Potter Valley in Mendocino County in 1859. It was in Potter Valley where Carpenter started the first newspaper in Mendocino County, the Mendocino Herald. He also wrote for the San Francisco Fair Daily and the Ukiah City Press. Eventually, the couple relocated to Ukiah. They started a commercial photography studio, which they operated for 40 years. They had a daughter, Grace and a son, Grant. In September 1856, the Carpenter's hosted Susan B. Anthony at their home in Ukiah when Anthony visited the city to speak at a rally. Carpenter died in 1919 in Ukiah, California. Work Carpenter's work focused on the early development of 19th and 20th century Mendocino County, California. Carpenter photographed panoramas of the coast, forests, and early industry, including logging and shipping. He documented the Pomo people and early white settlers, including Charmian London. In the 1960s, 700 glass plate negatives of Carpenter's photographers were found in the basement of the Sun House in Ukiah, the home where Carpenter's daughter Grace Hudson and her husband, John Hudson, lived. Local Ukiah photographer Robert Lee gathered the negatives and researched and created prints of the negatives, documenting the subjects seen in the images. It took forty years for Lee to complete the project. As a result, the first exhibition of Carpenter's work was held in 2006 at the Grace Hudson Museum, also celebrating the museums 20th anniversary. His works are held in the collection of the Sonoma County Library, SFMOMA and the Grace Hudson Museum. Further reading ;Publications by A. O. Carpenter *Carpenter, Aurelius O.

Biography Stefan Tenecki was born in the town of Lipova, near the city of Arad, in 1720. He was among the first Serbian artists to study painting in Kiev and at the Vienna Academy. His work was sought by several Serbian bishops in the course of his long career as an artist, Tenecki was an example of the Russian and Ukrainian Baroque style. Observing the talent of this young painter, Serbian Orthodox Bishop Isaja Antonoviƒá of Arad and Metropolitan of Karlovci (1731-1749) sent Tenecki to study at the painting school of Kiev Pechersk Lavra.After completing his studies in Kiev, Imperial Russia, he continued to perfect his art at the Vienna Academy of Painting.
