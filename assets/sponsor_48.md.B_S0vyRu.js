The son of a priest from the Shatsk district, Filaret is best known as a theologian and church historian. At the precocious age of 30 he was appointed Dean of the Moscow Theological Academy based in the Troitse- Sergiyeva Lavra. During his tenure in Riga (1841-1848) the Governorate of Livonia saw a religious conversion movement, as a result of which more than one hundred thousand Estonian and Latvian peasants converted to Orthodoxy. He also established a school in Riga in February 1846, which grew four years later into a seminary (Latvian: Rƒ´gas Garƒ´gais seminƒÅrs).Raudsepp, Anu. Riia Vaimulik Seminar 1846‚Äì1918. Tartu, Eesti Kirjandusmuuseum, 1998, page 25. His magnum opus is The History of the Russian Church (1847-48), the first complete and systematic outline of the evolution of the Russian Orthodox Church. It was seen as a clerical counterpart to Karamzin's great history of the Russian state and went through many reprints. This work was later revised and expanded by the likes of Macarius Bulgakov and Yevgeny Golubinsky. Filaret Gumilevsky was a very popular prelate. He is buried in the Trinity Cathedral, Chernihiv. In 2009, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) recognized him as a saint for local veneration.

He represented the Alwar Seat in the Parliament of India and was also the head of the Nath sect of Hinduism. He took deeksha from Mahant Shreyonath in 1978.https://indianexpress.com/article/india/alwar-mp- chand-nath-yogi-passes-away-narendra-modi-birthday-celebrations-4847499/  Personal life  Chandnath was the Chancellor of the Baba Mast Nath University. He was also the chief of the Nath sect of Hinduism. On 29 July 2016, he declared Mahant Balaknath as his successor in a ceremony which was attended by Yogi Adityanath and Baba Ramdev.  Political career  In the 2004 Indian Parliamentary election, Chandnath fought for the Alwar seat on a Bharatiya Janata Party ticket. But he was defeated by Karan Singh Yadav who belonged to the Indian National Congress. For the 2004 Rajasthan by election, Chandnath was given a ticket to contest the Behror seat. For the election, the party state president Lalit Kishore Chaturvedi and chief minister Vasundhara Raje held election rallies in his constituency. In the election, he emerged victorious by defeating a party rebel Jaswant Singh Yadav by a margin of 13 thousand votes. In the 2014 Indian Parliamentary election, Chandnath declared assets worth 2 lakh rupees ($3100). In the election, his opponent was Jitendra Singh of the Congress. He won the election and hence became a member of the parliament.  Controversies  During the 2004 election, there was a pending murder charge against Chandnath. During the 2014 Indian Lok Sabha election, a video became popular on the internet where allegedly yoga guru Baba Ramdev asked him to refrain from speaking about the issue of black money before the media. In February 2017, Chandnath was sentenced to one year rigorous imprisonment by a court in Haryana for criminal conspiracy after being found guilty in a case of land fraud.  Death  Chandnath died on 17 September 2017, aged 61 in a hospital in Delhi due to cancer. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted that he would be remembered for doing social work.

This word refers to the Pramana of Non-perception which consists in the presentative knowledge of negative facts. Hinduism Anupalabdhi or abhƒÅvapramƒÅ·πáa is the Pramana of Non-perception admitted by KumƒÅrila for the perception of non-existence of a thing. He holds that the non-existence of a thing cannot be perceived by the senses for there is nothing with which the senses could come into contact in order to perceive the non-existence. According to the BhƒÅ·π≠·π≠a school of P≈´rva-Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ and Advaita-VedƒÅnta system of philosophy, Anupalabdhi is a way to apprehend an absence; it is regarded as a means of knowledge, the other five being ‚Äì pratyak·π£a ('perception'), anumƒÅna ('inference'), ≈õabda ('testimony'), upamƒÅna ('comparison') and arthƒÅpatti ('presumption'). The perception of negation or non-existence in its various forms is also due to the relation of attributiveness. All things exist in places either in a positive (sadrupa) or in a negative (asadr≈´pa) relation, and it is only in the former case that they come into contact with the senses, while in the latter case the perception of the negative existence can only be had by a separate mode of movement of the mind, a separate pramƒÅ·πáa ‚Äì anupalabdhi. Indirect knowledge of non-existence can be attained by other means but direct knowledge of non-existence of perceptible objects and their attributes is available only through this kind of pramƒÅ·πáa which is not inference. There are four verities of Anupalabdhi which have been identified, they are ‚Äì a) kƒÅra·πáa-anupalabdhi or 'non-perception of the causal condition', b) vyƒÅpaka-anupalabdhi or 'non-perception of the pervader', c) svabhƒÅva- anupalabdhi or 'non-perception of presence of itself', and d) viruddha- anupalabdhi or 'non-perception of the opposed'. The lack of perceptible (yogya) adjuncts (upƒÅdhi) is known through non-perception of what is perceptible (yogya-anupalabdhi) and the lack of imperceptible adjuncts is known by showing that which is thought to be an adjunct. The followers of PrabhƒÅkara and the Vishishtadvaita do not accept anupalabdhi as a separate parmƒÅ·πáa because the same sense organs which apprehend an entity can also cognize its abhƒÅva or the non-existence. Buddhism According to Dharmakirti, anupalabdhi is the affirmative assertion of a negative prediction, and is same as anumƒÅna of an abhƒÅva.

Life Born at Bramshaw, Dorset, on 4 December 1817, he was eldest son of twin boys (brother George was the younger twin) of Colonel John Mansel (1776‚Äì1863) of Smedmore, Dorset by his wife Louisa, fourth daughter of Edmund Morton Pleydell of Whatcombe, Dorset. Educated privately, with Henry Walter as a tutor, he entered St. John's College, Cambridge in 1836, and graduated B.A. in 1839. Mansell was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 2 May 1840, but was not called to the bar. For thirty years he was an officer in the Queen's Own Dorset Yeomanry. He was promoted from lieutenant to captain on 26 July 1856. He was one of the promoters of the Somerset and Dorset Railway, and suffered financial losses. In 1856 Mansel built at his own expense the Milborne Reformatory, which was converted in 1882 into an industrial school. In 1857 he was made a fellow of the Geological Society, and was later also a fellow of the Linnean Society. He succeeded on his mother's death to the family estate of Whatcombe, Dorset, and to landed property in the Isle of Purbeck in 1863. In 1872 he assumed the additional name of Pleydell, his mother's maiden name. He founded the Dorset Natural History and Antiquarian Field Club in 1875, and was its president till his death. In 1876 Mansel- Pleydell was high sheriff of Dorset, and he was a member of the county council from its establishment in 1887 till his death. He was an evangelical in religion, and a Liberal in politics until 1886, when he changed his party after the Home Rule Bill. Mansel-Pleydell died at his Dorset residence on 3 May 1902. Works Mansel-Pleydell was the author of: * The Flora of Dorsetshire, 1874; 2nd edit. 1895. * The Birds of Dorsetshire, 1888. * The Mollusca of Dorsetshire, 1898. He also contributed papers on natural science and archaeology to the journals of learned societies. Legacy Mansel- Pleydell presented many geological finds made by himself to the County Museum of Dorset. These included a fore paddle of a Pleiosaurus macromerus,Paleobiology Database, Pleiosaurus macromerus. and the tusks and molars of a Mammuthus meridionalis. After his death, in 1902, a fund was raised to commission a portrait of John Clavell Mansel-Pleydell. This fund was over-subscribed by ‚Ç§ 83.00. His successor as the president of the Dorset Natural History and Antiquarian Field Club, Lord Eustace Cecil, donated a gift of ‚Ç§ 300.00. The funds were combined in the Mansel-Pleydell & Cecil Memorial Trust, for the promotion of the study of natural history, archaeology and physical sciences in Dorset. Originally, a small cash prize and a silver medal were provided for the winners of two competitions: one focussing on natural history and archaeology, and one on chemistry. Over the years the two fields were combined, and the medals were replaced by larger cash prizes. Income of the Trust is now also used for activities of the Dorset Museum. The first awards in 1906 were for W. Parkinson Curtis, who published about the ringed plover, and for Ernest W. Short, who published on \\"electricity as applied to household purposes.\\" Since then more than 200 prizes were awarded.For a complete list of prizes awarded by the Mansel-Pleydell & Cecil Memorial Trust click on the link on this page: Family Mansel-Pleydell married twice: # on 6 June 1844, Emily (died 4 Nov. 1845), daughter of Captain A.

E. Golubinsky Yevgeny Yevsigneyevich Golubinsky (; 28 February 1834 ‚Äì 7 January 1912) was one of three major church historians of the Russian Empire, along with Macarius Bulgakov and Filaret Gumilevsky. He was considered the foremost authority on the Russian medieval saints.Richard Taruskin. Stravinsky and the Russian Traditions. University of California Press, 1996. Page 90. Golubinsky was the son of an Orthodox priest from the district of Kologriv who gave him the surname of Fyodor Golubinsky, a religious philosopher from Kostroma. He was educated in the church schools of Soligalich and Kostroma before completing his studies at the Moscow Theological Academy. In 1872 and 1873, he travelled to the Holy Land and Mount Athos. Golubinsky's most highly regarded work examines the canonization practices of the Russian Orthodox Church. In 1881, he was awarded the Uvarov Prize for his outline of the history of the Russian Church. At the theological academy, Golubinsky repeatedly ran afoul of his conservative minded colleagues such as Konstantin Pobedonostsev, because he employed the innovative method of Positivism: \\"the objective study of a phenomenon to find a positive solution based on logic as opposed to superstition or some other nonrational approach\\".Quoted from: Lawrence P. King. Theories of the New Class: Intellectuals and Power. University of Minnesota Press, 2004. Pages 7-8. As a result of these conflicts, some of his works have never been published, although he was elected into the Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1902. He went blind four years later.

This album is one of the first by Crosby to not be released on 78 rpm records before going straight to an LP or set of 45s. The album includes several songs which had already enjoyed Billboard chart success. ‚ÄúAlong the Navajo Trail‚Äù reached the No. 2 position in 1945 and \\"One Hundred and Sixty Acres\\", \\"Have I Told You Lately That I Love You?\\" and \\"Quicksilver\\" also charted. Reception The album itself was not reviewed but Billboard commented favorably on several of the tracks when they were issued as singles. The tempo for \\"Along the Navajo Trail\\" was described by the magazine as being \\"geared to the slow blues and blending the hillbilly with the breakaway.\\" Billboard noted that \\"Go West, Young Man\\" included a light-hearted lyrical ribbing of the California Chamber of Commerce and \\"should hardly require a fanfare to make the hit grade.\\" The song was from the film from ‚ÄúCopacabana\\". \\"At the Flying ‚ÄúW‚Äù\\" was seen as a surefire Rhythm novelty whilst \\"A Hundred and Sixty Acres\\" brought the comments that the singers do full justice to a tune that is not of the same standard as 'At the Flying \\"W\\"'. \\"Have I Told You Lately That I Love You\\" was remembered as being popular a couple of years previously as a hillbilly record and the reviewer says that the vocalists are in top form. \\"Lock, Stock and Barrel\\" was felt to be a bit too sophisticated, but Ask Me No Questions is described as a relaxed harmony version which could be successful in both pop and country markets.

Background Winston Peters was a maverick National Party MP in 1992, and the Party was going through the process of expelling him. Peters was MP for Tauranga, comfortably held the seat, and it was anticipated that he would retain it no matter which party he stood for. In the run up to the 1993 general election, in order to retain Tauranga, the party required Peters to sign a form agreeing to not stand in any electorate for any political party other than the National Party. This was somewhat problematic for Peters, as he would soon start the new political party New Zealand First. Peters subsequently filed in court an interim injunction to have this declared invalid. John Collinge was named as the defendant, as he was the president of the National Party. Held The High Court ruled that this term interfered with the democratic process, making it illegal under common law, thus was legally unenforceable.

Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 2012. Donald Hawley, Oman, pg. 200. Life Ibn Zayd was born in the village of Firaq, near modern-day Nizwa in Oman. As a tabi'i from the second generation of Muslims, he was a student of Muhammad's widow Aisha and cousin Abd Allah ibn Abbas. Umayyad governor al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf had friendly relations with Ibn Zayd personally, as the former viewed the Ibadi denomination as a more moderate branch of the Khawarij that could be used as a bulwark against the more extreme adherents. This ended after Ibn Zayd ordered the execution of one of al-Hajjaj's spies, which led many Ibadis to be either imprisoned or exiled to Oman. After the death of Ibn Ibad, Ibn Zayd led the Ibadis to Oman where the a·∏•ƒÅdƒ´th ·π£a·∏•ƒ´·∏•at al-isnƒÅd he narrated from different companions of Muhammad formed the corpus of the Ibadi interpretation of Islamic law.

Background The Neylons purchased the Dickens farm, with the sale agreement requiring both parties to get the consent of the High Court within 30 days. Just before the expiry of the 30 days, Neylon's solicitor realized that as his client lived in far away Haast, they would be unable to get the consent in time. Dicken's solicitor agreed to file his clients consent on the basis that the purchasers consent would arrive later, which it did, but after the expiry date. The vendors claimed that as the expiry date was not met, the sale agreement came to an end. However, the purchasers later obtained an order from the Court of Appeal for specific performance. The Dickens appealed. Held The court held that the vendor's solicitor's agreement to file for the consent without first receiving the purchasers consent, was a valid waiver, and so the sale agreement was still a valid agreement.

The road marks the northern boundary of the neighbourhood and is officially divided into three, namely, from west to east, the Basin Bridge Road, the Old Jail Road, and the Ibrahim Sahib Street. The road joins the Grand Northern Trunk (GNT) Road at the Wall Tax Road‚ÄìGNT Road junction in the west and the Rajaji Salai in the east. The road, serving as a reminder of the neighbourhood's historical past, is address to many historic places such as the Government Stanley Medical College, Monegar Choultry, and Seven Wells pumping station. History The road got its name from the civil debtors' prison established by the British in 1692. The prison was initially housed under a section of a protective wall, known as the old town wall, constructed to the north of the road by Paul Benfield between 1769 and 1772, marking the northern end of Black Town (the present-day George Town). Similar to a previous protective stone wall built in the middle of the 17th century, enclosures in the wall served as cells for prisoners. The prison was established near the western end of the wall. The law of the then British Government mandated that the expenses of the prison's inmates, who were primarily money defaulters, be borne by their respective complainants. By 1793, Old Jail Road was much improved under Sheriff Edward Atkinson. By the early 1800s, the prison was moved to the location where Bharathi Women's College stands today, on the corner of Popham's Broadway. In 1804, the jail was named the Civil Jail. With the advent of the Central prison next to the Government General Hospital in the middle of the 19th century, the civil debtors' prison became known as the Old Jail and was put to civilian use. After Independence, the Old Jail was vacated and its inmates were moved to the Central Prison. Since then, the facility housed various educational institutions. In 1916, the Madras Trades School was established, which used the buildings on the old jail campus. By 1938, it grew into the School of Technology and in 1946 as Central Polytechnic. Shortly after Independence, under the insistence of Kamaraj, a cottage industries training centre of the Congress Prachar Sabha was started on the campus, sharing the premises with the Polytechnic. In 1955, the printing section of the Polytechnic was converted into the country's first Regional School of Printing. In 1958, the Polytechnic moved to Adyar, and the Old Jail campus remained the Regional School of Printing, sharing the campus with the cottage industries training centre until the training centre was closed in 1964. Meanwhile, a new women's arts college was established, which too shared the campus with the School of Printing. When the School of Printing moved to Adyar in 1968, the women's college increased its enrolment and occupied the whole of the Old Jail campus. The college was named Bharati Women's College and remains to the present day. Water to the Fort St. George and the expanding city surrounding the fort was supplied by the Seven Wells (known locally as 'Yezhu Kinaru') pumping station located on the road. On a night in 1767, when Nawab Hyder Ali of Mysore fought the British in Madras, his troops tried to poison the water source. However, the plan was averted by an Anglo-Indian named John Nicolas. In return of gratitude, Nicolas was made the Superintendent of Seven Wells Water Works by the British government when the pumping station started supplying water again from 1772. Thus the first organised water supply in Madras began with the Seven Wells Scheme. In addition to the authority to head the pumping station, Nicolas was given a house, horse and a palanquin. The descendants of the Nicolas family inherited the authority until the end of 1925. In 1781, a great famine struck Madras, which lasted till 1784. The affected people sought asylum in a locality on the Old Jail Road to whom porridge was provided. In 1782, the spot was converted to a choultry for asylum-seekers, chiefly elderly people. The choultry was named the Monegar Choultry after Maniakkaran, a village headman. Later, the choultry was moved to another location giving way to an infirmary, named the Madras Native Infirmary, established in 1799. Known as the 'Kanji Thotti Hospital' (meaning 'porridge bowl hospital'), the hospital was named Stanley Hospital in 1933, after George Frederick Stanley, the then Governor of Madras. The choultry still functions as an asylum for elderly people. The present-day road The long stretch of road that was the northern bounds of Black Town, which later came to be known as George Town, is today officially designated as, from west to east, Basin Bridge Road, Old Jail Road and Ebrahim Sahib Street. Although the actual road stretches to about 2.3 km from west to east, the name 'Old Jail Road', as identified today, covers only about 750 metres from the Mint Clock Tower to Bharati Women's College. The streets that radiate from Old Jail Road, including the Portuguese Church Street, Old Jail Lane, Anna Pillai Street, and Peddu Naicken Street, are now home to dense residential and commercial establishments. Osian Heights Towers, the tallest building in the neighbourhood, as seen from the Washermanpet railway lines A half-a-century- old timber market functions along the North Wall Road near the Old Jail Road, where some shops deal with wood brought from the Andaman Islands. The government, however, is planning to shift the market to an alternative location due to road expansion projects. The Marakkadai area got its name from the timber market. The place where the Seven Wells (known locally as 'Yezhu Kinaru') pumping station that supplied water to the city including Fort St. George was located now houses the workshop and stores of the Public Works Department. However, one of the old wells still supplies water to the Fort. The road also houses the Mint Clock Tower, one of the four freestanding clock towers in the city, which is located at the Mint Junction. A flyover was inaugurated in 2014 at the Mint Junction on the Old Jail Road, connecting it with the Basin Bridge Road, where the Mint Street joins the road. The junction witnesses about 100,000 vehicles a day. This is the first intersection in George Town to get a flyover. The four-laned flyover measures 520 metres in length and 15 metres in width and is built at a cost of 230 million. The western part of the stretch, the Basin Bridge Road, houses the 18-storied Osian Heights, the tallest residential building in George Town.

Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/23521364 At the end of the Seven Years' War, he served in the 77th Regiment of Foot at the siege of Havana, and then at New York, in 1762. The regiment was broken up soon afterwards, but Mante then joined Henry Bouquet in his 1763 campaign that formed part of Pontiac's War. During 1764 Mante was attached to John Bradstreet, as brigade major, in the expedition leading to the siege of Fort Detroit. Later in 1764 Mante was in London. He has been taken to be the author of the 1765 plan to plant a British colony at Detroit, which was rejected. Running up debts, Mante offended his patrons, Bradstreet and Sir Charles Gould. He became involved in British intelligence work through dealings in the 1770s with the government official John Robinson; but he had already by then been recruited to spy for the French, from 1769, by Jean-Charles-Adolphe Grant de Blairfindy. Mante's role as a double agent was probably known to the British by 1774, when they ceased to pay him. He had emigrated to Dieppe in northern France in 1773, and spent time in debtors' prison. To make ends meet he wrote, producing a work in French on agriculture, and novels in English based on French originals, published by Thomas Hookham. He was back in London in 1781, and at the end of his life was working still on his Naval and Military History. Works Mante wrote: *History of the late War in America, including the Campaigns against His Majesty's Indian Enemies, London, 1772. *Treatise on the Use of Defensive Arms, translated from the French of Joly de Maizeray, with Remarks, London, 1771. *Elementary Principles of Tactics (1771). *System of Tactics, translated from the French of Joly de Maizeray, 1781, dedicated to Guy Carleton, lord Dorchester, London, 1781. *Naval and Military History of the Wars of England, including those of Scotland and Ireland, London, 1795?-1807.

History Hugh Ashton, Robert Doran and Clive Pierce were introduced to chanteuse Regine Fetet, who, having never sung before had an enigmatic, fragile human voice which mated perfectly with the sound the three British sound engineers were creating. Hard Corps were an electronic band that pioneered electronic music in the 1980s and released their first EP in 1984 Dirty/Respirer on Survival Records, with Respirer also being released that year on The Art of Survival compilation EP along with bands such as Tik and Tok, Eddie and Sunshine and Richard Bone. Respirer was produced by Mute Records founder and electronic music production supremo Daniel Miller. In 1985, the band supported The Cure in the UK and Europe and in 1988 supported Depeche Mode in the UK. They were on the cusp of making a real impact and hoped to support Depeche Mode when they returned to the USA, but according to an interview by Rob Doran for The Electricity Club: \\"However, we were not invited possibly due to British and American Musician Union politics on support bands and reciprocal agreements, but I don‚Äôt think there was any chance with Regine‚Äôs onstage controversies anyway!\\" By the time the band released their first album in 1990 (produced by Martin Rushent), they had already split up. Doran went on to write music for TV, radio, commercials and video with the singer from Perfect Strangers, Rod Syers. Ashton carried on with Regine for a while doing PAs and using the Hard Corps' name before becoming The Sun Kings with former Naked Lunch member Paul ‚ÄòDriver‚Äô Davies. Clive Pierce was still writing and producing electronic music. The band is noteworthy for Regine's provocative performances, which often involved her removing her top on stage; an apocryphal story suggests that this may have been the reason for the band not supporting Depeche Mode in the USA. Regine Fetet died of cancer in 2003. A number of previously unreleased tracks were made available on Minimal Wave Records.

Career In the Spanish Civil War Gehr worked as a stills photographer before travelling to Egypt at the wars commencement where he shot newsreels for Wide World photos. With the advent of Nazism in his native Germany, Gehr moved to the United States in March 1937. Upon arrival in the United States, Gehr found representation with the Black Star photo agency, and began working for Life magazine in 1938,LIFE, 14 Feb 1944, Vol. 16, No. 7, p. 19, ISSN 0024-3019, Time Inc photographing a large variety of subjects and stories for them over the next few years. By 1940 Gehr had been described as having shot such diverse subjects as \\"sphinxes, hair ribbons, wars and movie stars\\" for the magazine. Gehr left Life in 1950 and became a television director for ABC. Technique Gehr's photographic style was renowned for his use of artificial light. Gehr once used twenty assistants to illuminate six blocks of Manhattan's Meatpacking District with flash bulbs, and in a photograph of the Great Sphinx of Giza taken for Life in 1938, he used the headlights of three cars to illuminate the scene, with an exposure time of three hours. Murder trial In July 1950, shortly after leaving Life, Gehr accidentally shot his wife dead. In search of evidence of his adultery, Gehr's wife had unexpectedly arrived in the middle of the night at his country house near Brewster, New York with detectives, while Gehr was with his mistress. Mistaking the visitors for prowlers, his shooting also injured two of the four detectives present. His mistress leapt out of a window. Gehr was arrested and stood trial for second degree murder, and was acquitted. Gehr changed his name after the trial. At the conclusion of the case the jurors blamed Gehr's case on the divorce laws of New York state, as his wife had been seeking evidence for his adultery, which was required by law. Gehr resumed his work as a television director after his trial. Recognition In 1955 Museum of Modern Art curator of photography Edward Steichen included one of Gehr's LIFE photographs in the world-touring The Family of Man exhibition, seen by 9 million visitors, and also in its widely distributed catalogue, which is still in print. Gehr won three Emmy Awards before his 1983 death.

This is what Professor Ehud Shapiro from the Weizmann Institute termed a ‚ÄúDoctor in a cell‚Äù. Pioneering work In 1998 Shapiro presented a conceptual design for an autonomous, programmable molecular Turing machine, realized at the time as a mechanical device, and a vision of how such machines can cause a revolution in medicine.Shapiro E., 1999 A mechanical Turing machine: blueprint for a biomolecular computer. In Paper presented at the Proc. 5th Int. Meeting on DNA-based Computers, 14‚Äì15 June 1999. Providence, RI: AMS Press. The vision, termed ‚ÄúDoctor in a Cell‚Äù suggested that smart drugs, made of autonomous molecular computing devices, programmed with medical knowledge, could supplant present day drugs by analyzing the molecular state of their environment (input) based on programmed medical knowledge (program), and if deemed necessary release a drug molecule in response (output).Shapiro, Ehud. \\"A mechanical Turing machine: blueprint for a biomolecular computer.\\" Interface Focus 2.4 (2012): 497-503. First steps towards realization of the vision To realize this vision, Shapiro set a wet lab at Weizmann. Within a few years the lab has made pioneering steps towards realizing this vision: (1) A molecular implementation of a programmable autonomous automaton in which the input was encoded as a DNA molecule, ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù (automaton transition rules) was encoded by short DNA molecules and the ‚Äúhardware‚Äù was made of made DNA processing enzymes.K., Benenson, T., Paz-Elitzur, R., Adar, E., Keinan, Z., Livneh and E. Shapiro. (2001) Programmable and autonomous computing machine made of biomolecules. Nature 414, 430-434. (2) A simplified implementation of an automaton in which the DNA input molecule is used as fuelBenenson Y, Adar R, Paz-Elizur T, Livneh Z, Shapiro E, (2003) DNA molecule provides a computing machine with both data and fuel, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. (3) A stochastic molecular automata in which transition probabilities can be programmed by varying the concentration of ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù molecules, specifically the relative concentrations of molecules encoding competing transition rules.Adar R., Benenson Y., Linshiz G., Rozner A, Tishby N. and Shapiro E. (2004) Stochastic computing with biomolecular automata. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 101, 9960-65. And (4) Extending the stochastic automaton with input and output mechanisms, allowing it to interact with the environment in a pre-programmed way, and release a specific drug molecule for cancer upon detecting expression levels of mRNA characteristic of a specific cancer.Yaakov Benenson, Binyamin Gil ,Uri Ben-Dor, Rivka Adar & Ehud Shapiro, (2004), An autonomous molecular computer for logical control of gene expression, Nature, 429, 423-429 These biomolecular computers were demonstrated in a test tube, wherein a number of cancer markers were pre-mixed to emulate different marker combinations. Biomolecular computers identified the presence of cancer markers (Simultaneously and independently identifying small-cell lung cancer markers and prostate cancer markers). The computer, equipped with medical knowledge, analysed the situation, diagnosed the type of cancer and then released the appropriate drug. DNA computers capable of simple logical deductions In 2009, Shapiro and PhD student Tom Ran presented the prototype of an autonomous programmable molecular system, based on the manipulation of DNA strands, which is capable of performing simple logical deductions.Tom Ran, Shai Kaplan & Ehud Shapiro, (2009), Molecular implementation of simple logic programs, Nature Nanotechnology, August, 2009. This prototype is the first simple programming language implemented on molecular-scale. Introduced into the body, this system has immense potential to accurately target specific cell types and administer the appropriate treatment, as it can perform millions of calculations at the same time and ‚Äòthink‚Äô logically. Prof Shapiro‚Äôs team aims to make these computers perform highly complex actions and answer complicated questions, following a logical model first proposed by Aristotle over 2000 years ago. The biomolecular computers are extremely small: three trillion computers can fit into a single drop of water. If the computers were given the rule ‚ÄòAll men are mortal‚Äô and the fact ‚ÄòSocrates is a man‚Äô, they would answer ‚ÄòSocrates is mortal‚Äô. Multiple rules and facts were tested by the team and the biomolecular computers answered them correctly each time. ‚ÄòUser-friendly‚Äô DNA computers The team has also found a way to make these microscopic computing devices ‚Äòuser-friendly‚Äô by creating a compiler ‚Äì a program for bridging between a high-level computer programming language and DNA computing code. They sought to develop a hybrid in silico/in vitro system that supports the creation and execution of molecular logic programs in a similar way to electronic computers, enabling anyone who knows how to operate an electronic computer, with absolutely no background in molecular biology, to operate a biomolecular computer. DNA computers via computing bacteria In 2012, Prof. Ehud Shapiro and Dr. Tom Ran have succeeded in creating a genetic device that operates independently in bacterial cells.Tom Ran, Yehonatan Douek, Lilach Milo, Ehud Shapiro. A programmable NOR-based device for transcription profile analysis. Scientific Reports, 2012. The device has been programmed to identify certain parameters and mount an appropriate response. The device searches for transcription factors - proteins that control the expression of genes in the cell. A malfunction of these molecules can disrupt gene expression. In cancer cells, for example, the transcription factors regulating cell growth and division do not function properly, leading to increased cell division and the formation of a tumor. The device, composed of a DNA sequence inserted into a bacterium, performs a \\"roll call\\" of transcription factors. If the results match pre-programmed parameters, it responds by creating a protein that emits a green light‚Äîsupplying a visible sign of a \\"positive\\" diagnosis. In follow-up research, the scientists plan to replace the light-emitting protein with one that will affect the cell's fate, for example, a protein that can cause the cell to commit suicide. In this manner, the device will cause only \\"positively\\" diagnosed cells to self-destruct. Following the success of the study in bacterial cells, the researchers are planning to test ways of recruiting such bacteria as an efficient system to be conveniently inserted into the human body for medical purposes (which shouldn't be problematic given our natural Microbiome; recent research reveals there are already 10 times more bacterial cells in the human body than human cells, that share our body space in a symbiotic fashion). Yet another research goal is to operate a similar system inside human cells, which are much more complex than bacteria.

The keel of the new vessel was launched at the Japanese shipyard on 19 July 2013 and she was launched only two months later on 29 September. Initially set for delivery in December 2013, the new vessel, Nunavik, was completed on 30 January 2014. She is named after Nunavik, the area compromising the northern third of the province of Quebec, Canada. Several commenters have noted that while it took only couple of years to build Nunavik in Japan, the design and construction of the new polar icebreaker, CCGS John G.

LiveScience, 1 October 2014. The Northwest Passage route is forty percent shorter than the Panama Canal route. In 2017, Baffinland, the operators of a massive new open-pit iron-ore mine, in northern Baffin Island, planned to charter the Nunavik to carry supplies, through mid-winter ice, to its port in Milne Inlet. This mid-winter shipment would have included additional massive 200 tonne dump trucks, so they could be ready for the beginning of operations, in the spring. However, in February 2017, the Nunavut Impact Review Board declined to approve the shipment, due to the impact of the voyage on sea mammals Inuit people rely on for food, and because it would interfere with local people traveling across the ice. In 2018, Nunavik was chartered by Ironbark Zinc for a test voyage to prove the shipping route feasible for its Citronen project in Northern Greenland.Ironbark ticks off Nunavik shipping route.

Biography Persaud was born on 23 August 1960 in Guyana, South America. At age 16 she moved to Brooklyn. Persaud attended the New York University School of Medicine after receiving her undergraduate degree from York College CUNY. She also earned a master's degree at the New York University School of Medicine. She started Residency at the Babies Hospital of New York and finished her Chief Residency at the same hospital. Persaud later was a fellow at the New York University School of Medicine. She began her academic career as an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine from 1997 to 2004. In 2005, Persaud became an Associate Professor of Pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Research The main topic of Persaud's research is AIDS and HIV of children. However, her research started from research about HIV in adults. In 2003, she stated about the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)- type1 included in the subtypes of HIV. For the HIV patient, the HAART(Highly active antiretroviral therapy) is used as treatment. The HAART regimen includes some drugs containing Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and protease inhibitor (PI), and non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). The HAART has important function to suppress the levels of HIV-1 to below quantification. HIV-1 persists in cellular reservoirs of CD4+ continually with low-level viremia in adults, and this is very sensitive. Persaud and her research team found that viremia persists in children with plasma virus remaining at a level under the limit of detection of clinical assays. When children with HIV-1 receive HAART treatment, the viremia that is difficult to observe is continued virus production without resistance in the protease gene. Persaud's research team tried to find a novel culture assay that can stimulate the virus production during their latent, integrated HIV-1 in resting CD4+ T cells with the antiretroviral drugs. These drugs interfere with the replication of unintegrated virus. They also demonstrated the facts that HIV-1 polymerase sequences from the resting CD4+ T cells of the patients. By following this research, her research topic has been about antiretroviral therapy. In 2009, her research team focused on the ongoing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). From this research, it was figured out ongoing virus replication contributes to low-level viremia in patients on HAART, and this ongoing replication is subject to CD8+ T-cell selective pressure. After that, she suggested the induction therapy by using protease-inhibitors has influenced the effect of NNRTI (non-Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) resistance on virologic response to nevirapine-based HAART in children patients of HIV. For a long time, her research topic has been focusing on the therapy of HIV-1 especially with the child patients. In order to develop the therapy, she has been explained about the mechanism using the NNRTI of HAART.

He is the fourth president of Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), a major component party of Barisan Nasional (BN) from 1975 to 1983. He led the party in three general election elections in Malaysia, most successfully in the 1982 general election. He held various ministerial posts in the cabinet of the Malaysian government from 1969 to 1983, such as Labour and Manpower Minister, Works and Public Utilities Minister, as well as Transport Minister Early life Lee San Choon was born on 24 March 1935 in Pekan, Pahang to Lee Debin () and Yang Zhenling (), immigrant parents from Tianmen, Hubei in China. Lee had his early education in a Chinese-medium school, Chung Hwa School in Pekan, before being transferred to Sultan Ahmad School for a year of English education. The family moved to Johor Bahru in Johor when he was 12, and he completed his secondary education at Johore English College. After finishing school, he taught English at a primary school in Singapore, held a minor position in the government's Social Welfare Department, then worked as a clerk in a textile factory. Political career Lee San Choon joined the Malayan Chinese Association in 1957. He was elected a Member of Parliament in the Kluang Utara parliamentary seat in the 1959 Malayan general election, winning the former socialist stronghold by a majority of 1,458 votes, and became the youngest MP in Malaya at the age of 24. After Kluang Utara, he represented the Segamat Selatan constituency from 1964 to 1974 and Segamat until 1982. He was elected Chairman of MCA Youth in 1962. In 1968, as the MCA Youth leader, he was involved in the creation of the Koperatif Serbaguna Malaysia Bhd (KSM), a business organization based on the cooperative principle. After the May 13 Riots in 1969, he was appointed Deputy Minister with Special Functions in the Cabinet by the National Operations Council. When parliamentary democracy was restored in 1971, he was given the post of Labour Minister in the new cabinet. He became the Deputy President of MCA in 1972. On 8 April 1974, just before the 1974 general election, he was made Acting President of MCA after Tun Tan Siew Sin resigned on grounds of ill-health. He was then elected President of MCA in August 1975. He held various offices in the Malaysian government, such as the Labour and Manpower Minister, the Works and Public Utilities Minister, and the Transport Minister. While he was president of MCA, he launched five major initiatives. These were the building of Wisma MCA, the headquarter of the party; the setting up of a building fund for Tunku Abdul Rahman College to expand opportunity for tertiary education for the Chinese population; the founding of Multi-Purpose Holdings Berhad, an investment holding company; the establishment of Malaysian Chinese Cultural Society; and a drive to increase MCA membership. In the 1982 general election, in response to a taunt by the opposition Democratic Action Party (DAP) that the MCA's leadership did not dare contest seats with large urban Chinese majority, Lee accepted the challenge and contested the parliamentary seat for Seremban against the DAP Chairman Dr. Chen Man Hin who had held that seat since 1969. Lee won the contest, and also led his party to a landslide victory, winning 24 out of 28 allocated parliamentary seats and 55 out of 62 state seats. However, on 24 March 1983, at the height of his career, Lee unexpectedly resigned from the Cabinet for unspecified reason, and relinquished his position as President of MCA a day later. In 2000, he claimed in an interview with the Chinese edition of Asiaweek that he was \\"stabbed in the back\\" by UMNO leaders in the 1982 election. Business career After his retirement from politics, Lee was appointed Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of Multi-Purpose Holdings Bhd, Chairman of Malaysian French Bank Bhd and Chairman of Industrial Oxygen Incorporated Bhd.

Upon the accession of James I, Lord Burghley petitioned the king to recognise Fiennes as the legitimate successor to his ancestor's barony. In 1603, James I issued letters patent confirming Fiennes and the heirs of his body as Baron Saye and Sele.John Debrett, Debrett's Peerage of England, Scotland, and Ireland (1836), 202. However, because it was erroneously assumed that the barony of 1447 had been created by writ of summons, the succession was altered from that of heirs male to those of heirs general, thereby allowing the title to pass through daughters. Additionally, the 1603 patent effectively created a new title for Fiennes, and barred him from claiming the precedence and privilege of the 1447 creation. Despite the resulting loss of pride for the family, they yielded in order to secure the title.Cracroft's Peerage: The Complete Guide to the British Peerage and Baronetage - 'Saye and Sele, Baron (E, 1446/7 - 1781)' http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/saye1446.htm He married (circa 1581) firstly Constance Kingsmill, the eldest daughter of Sir William Kingsmill of Sidmonton, north Hampshire, and secondly Elizabeth (died 1632) daughter of Henry Coddingham (Auditor of the Mint), and widow of William Paulet.

He was not at all specific, but he hinted at liberal reforms of the sort that emerged in The First Hundred Days after his inauguration in March 1933. Scholars rate it among the 100 greatest speeches made by a President in the 20th century.D. W. Houck, Commonwealth Club Address: Redefining Individualism, Adjudicating Greatness (2004) p 259 Roosevelt's argument Roosevelt was long on history and short on specifics. He sketched a philosophical foundation for the New Deal, and ultimately for a Second Bill of Rights that he was committed to achieving over the course of his administration. Most historians consider it prophetic regarding the actual content of New Deal liberalism.Houck, p 264 The great era of rapid economic growth had ended, Roosevelt argued.Quotes from Roosevelt, \\"Commonwealth Club Address,\\" online version In the days when growth was all-important, he agreed that it had been necessary to turn political and economic power over to entrepreneurs who were building the nation. But the era of economic growth was over he said; the entrepreneurs are now dangerous: : A mere builder of more industrial plants, a creator of more railroad systems, an organizer of more corporations, is as likely to be a danger as a help. The day of the great promoter or the financial Titan, to whom we granted anything if only he would build, or develop, is over. Roosevelt said that further growth was unnecessary: \\"Our task now is not discovery or exploitation of natural resources, or necessarily producing more goods.\\" What America instead needed to do: :Is the soberer, less dramatic business of administering resources and plants already in hand, of seeking to reestablish foreign markets for our surplus production, of meeting the problem of underconsumption, of adjusting production to consumption, of distributing wealth and products more equitably, of adapting existing economic organizations to the service of the people. The day of enlightened administration has come. Parts of his speech had a gloomy tone: \\"A glance at the situation today only too clearly indicates that equality of opportunity as we have known it no longer exists.\\" \\"We are steering a steady course toward economic oligarchy, if we are not there already.\\" However he did hint at reforms that would bring about a better world: \\"Every man has a right to life; and this means that he has also a right to make a comfortable living.\\" Biographer Frank Freidel emphasizes that Roosevelt wanted government to \\"act as a regulator for the common good within the existing economic system.\\" Roosevelt believed his philosophy was in accord with the traditions of Thomas Jefferson and Woodrow Wilson, as modified to deal with a much more complex and mature economic order.Freidel, p. 355 Reception The response to the speech by the 2000-member luncheon audience and by the national media was tepid. Some thought it too socialistic; others considered it too academic in tone, especially for its long passages on the lessons of American and European history. Roosevelt did not try to rework his material into simpler speeches. He moved on to other topics, and received a rousing reception to the more usual speech he gave that same evening.Houck, p 262 The speech was written by Adolf A. Berle and his wife Beatrice, who worked on Roosevelt's campaign office.Eden, 1993 Further reading * Eden, Robert. \\"On the Origins of the Regime of Pragmatic Liberalism: John Dewey, Adolf A.

Two years later (June 4, 1876) he was appointed archpriest of Bivona and lived there for the next 20 years. In 1897 he was appointed director of the College of Saints Augustine and Thomas of Agrigento and the rector of the local seminary. Pope Leo XIII appointed him bishop in August 1899 for the diocese of Caltagirone: he went to Rome to ask the Pope to lift the prohibition on Italian Catholics participating in national political life.Donato, La primavera, op. cit. p. 54-55 Activity During his bishopric matures and is carried through the happy season of the Christian Social People's Party whose experience will arise which cooperate the priest Don Luigi Sturzo.Donato, La primavera, op. cit. p. 55 Certainly without De Bono, Sturzo wouldn't to be able to become a politician and statesman who was, much less couldn't to be continuing to remain in the ministry.

The office the mayor Luigi Sturzo is considered today among the most important political events in the history of Italy. Its relevance was also a moral and ethical, because of the corruption present in the municipal administration of then stimulated also by the central government. The Catholic's movement reached extraordinary dimensions and appearances, not only in doctrine and in projects, especially in the concrete achievements. It was about Sturzo - and then De Bono - the policy has been removed from the ford of the Vatican because of NOT EXPEDIT, preventing Catholics from politics and be elected to the Parliament, had come to support the corrupt men and finally supported the corrupt men of Giolitti.

Features P. micromeros is considerably smaller than modern kiwis, weighing around 234.1 ‚Äì 377g (the smallest living kiwi, Apteryx owenii, weighs at least 800 g), and its more gracile otic process may indicate a shorter bill. It bears distinctively slender hindlimbs, more comparable in terms of proportion to flying birds like the banded rail than to extant kiwis, and it is speculated to have been capable of powered flight, or to have evolved relatively recently from flying ancestors. Importance The fact that Proapteryx lacked specialisation for a terrestrial, flightless lifestyle supports the hypothesis that kiwi ancestors flew to New Zealand from Australia in the Miocene, well after moas had developed their modern forms ‚Äì moa remains are also known from Saint Bathans, already large and flightless.Worthy, T.H., Tennyson, A.J.D., Jones, C., McNamara, J.A. & Douglas B.J.

Plot  The story is narrated from the perspective of Chetna Grddha Mullick, daughter of hangman Phanibhushan Grddha Mullick, whose family lives near Nimtala Ghat in Chitpur, Kolkata. Chetna lives with her father, mother, brother (Ramu da), grandmother (Thakuma) father's brother (whom she calls Kaku) and his wife (Kakima). She is twenty two years old, and had been an intelligent student, scoring distinction in her plus two. However, due to financial constraints, she does not study further. Her mother and Kakima sell tea to make ends meet at home. They live in poverty since the number of executions have only been decreasing in the last few decades. Meanwhile, Phanibhushan remains in significant media scrutiny because of his job, but he is very particular about not having Chetna's photograph in the public eye. This is because of what happened to his son, Ramu da, Chetna's older brother. Phanibhushan had been the hangman at the execution of Amartya Ghosh, who had murdered a Kolkata industrialist Chandresen Ghosh and his three children. Amartya Ghosh's parents came to Phanibhushan, begging to somehow prevent their son's execution. However, Phani is adamant that he cannot let his judgment get in the way of his profession, and refuses to listen to them. Two days after Amartya's execution, his father follows Ramu da, Phani's son, back from college and hacks his limbs. This leaves Phani's only son disabled and depressed. Phani, therefore, is keen that his daughter Chetna get a government job after his retirement since he has no one else who can take care of the family once he is gone. Phani takes great pride in his profession and the lineage of his family, which has for a long time been in this profession. In late May, the family awaits the result of the mercy petition for Jatindranath Banerjee's execution, so that they would know if Phanibhushan has to be the hangman for his execution or not. Sanjeev Kumar Mitra, a news reporter for CNC, covers the story about Jatindranath's execution. For this reason, he visits Phanibhushan. Chetna is attracted to him due to his charismatic appearance and charming speech. However, he verbally abuses her in private. Mitra helps Phanibhushan to try to convince government officials to give the job of the executioner to Chetna, thereby making her the first hangwoman in the country. Later, he asks Phanibhushan for her hand in marriage which he readily agrees because Mitra is an intelligent journalist whom Phani respects.

The conflict does not only involve territorial questions, but also extends to political and language issues, as well as questions about provision of services and transport connections. Geographically, the enclave is situated inside the Province of √Ålava, which completely surrounds it. However, administratively, it belongs to the Province of Burgos. The territory is near the large Basque city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, with over 200,000 inhabitants, while the nearest urban center in Burgos province is Miranda de Ebro, with about 40,000 inhabitants. The enclave holds cultural, commercial and linguistic links with the neighbouring √Ålava province. According to a Burgos newspaper, in a legal sense there is no territorial dispute, since Trevi√±o's status as part of Castile and Le√≥n is long established. However, Trevi√±o has been subject to heated political dispute during the last decades, including legal litigation at the highest level. The two municipalities which make up the enclave, Condado de Trevi√±o and La Puebla de Arganz√≥n, have at various times sought to join √Ålava, and the inhabitants of the two towns have also campaigned to join the Basque Country. History Trevi√±o was officially founded in 1161 by King Sancho VI of Navarre on the site of a monastery. and became part of the Kingdom of Castile in 1201, following a military victory by King Alfonso VIII of Castile over the Navarrans. When Javier de Burgos conducted the 1833 territorial division of Spain--a decision passed by royal decree--one of the principles held in the new arrangement was the elimination of enclaves and their incorporation into the nearest appropriate territory, in this case the closest territory belonging to the Spanish general regime, as opposed to the Basque territories (Exempt Territories, Foral Territories). Nevertheless, the Trevi√±o enclave survived and was confirmed as part of Castile in the final legislation. The Basque territories clung on to home rule (fueros) up to the end of the Third Carlist War, with their separate taxation system. Therefore, the fiscal contribution of the enclave added to the Spanish central coffers, not to the Basque relevant one--√Ålava. Following this legislation, three unsuccessful attempts were made to incorporate the area into √Ålava. In 1880, the two municipalities covering Trevi√±o requested that they be transferred from Burgos to √Ålava, while the inhabitants of the enclave requested their transfer in 1940 and 1958. =Position of √Ålava and the Trevi√±o enclave= Most of the main political parties in √Ålava are in favour of adding the Trevi√±o enclave to their territory. Modern votes on Trevi√±o's status date from the 1940 referendum in Trevi√±o, where 98% of the population voted to join √Ålava. Several further attempts have occurred since then. In 1980, both municipalities of the enclave overwhelmingly voted in support of an incorporation into √Ålava; some time before, UCD representatives in the councils had been removed from their positions for supporting the incorporation. In 1998, in another unofficial referendum, 68% of voters in the exclave were in favour of holding an official referendum on joining √Ålava. 76% of voters took part. The municipality of La Puebla de Arganz√≥n voted in 1995 and 1997 to join √Ålava. The majority of political parties in Trevi√±o are in favour of joining √Ålava, with the authorities of the enclave requesting the initiation of proceedings leading to their incorporation into √Ålava in 2013. Their reasons are usually the practical grounds of better links with √Ålava rather than Burgos. =Position of Burgos= In contrast, all political groupings in Burgos have defended the enclave remaining part of their territory, on both legal and historic grounds. 1970s and 1980s Sculpture in the town hall of Condado de Trevi√±o recalling the historical attempts by Trevi√±o to become part of √Ålava In 1979, deputies (congressmen) Xabier Arzalluz of the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) and Jos√© Mar√≠a Bandr√©s of Euskadiko Ezkerra, affirmed that Article 8 of the then-new Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country was intended to integrate Trevi√±o into √Ålava and the similar exclave of Villaverde de Truc√≠os (Cantabria) into Biscay.

This is page 517 of the PDF. Accessed online 2010-01-04. Nonetheless, Trevi√±o remained part of the province of Burgos. Burgos was quick to react by sealing in their later Statute of Autonomy (1983) any possibility of a smooth integration of Trevi√±o into √Ålava by means of provisions that actually clash with the avenues established in the Basque Statute of Autonomy (1978), since it requires the consent of the authorities of the province of Burgos and the autonomous community of Castile and Le√≥n before Trevi√±o can join √Ålava.Cesar Aguado Renedo, Acerca de la Naturaleza Jur√≠dica del Estatuto de Autonom√≠a, Revista Espa√±ola de Derecho Constitucional, N√∫mero 49.

After that, the government and parliament of the Basque Country brought a case challenging the constitutionality of that provision, but in 1986 it was rejected by the Constitutional Court of Spain. (The Statutes of Autonomy in Spain were approved as Organic Law by the Cortes Generales Constitution of Spain (1978), Article 147) 2013 and on The 2011 local elections in the two Trevi√±o municipalities resulted in a majority of seats for parties in favour of joining √Ålava and a formal request for this to take place. However, the Province of Burgos blocked the move. The position held by the Castilian authorities has halted attempts by the municipalities to change their status. The mayor of the Trevi√±o municipality stated in February 2014 that the question of Trevi√±o has been turned into a matter of State, and urged the Spanish government to accept the bill passed by the Basque parliament to take the steps necessary for the incorporation of the enclave. In the 2015 local elections pro-integration parties won the elections again in both Condado de Trevi√±o and La Puebla de Arganz√≥n. In Condado de Trevi√±o two local parties in favour of joining √Ålava were the most voted (Citizens of El Condado and Independent Group of the Condado de Trevi√±o),Election results - Condado de Trevi√±o.

In April 2018, after 23 years of dire dispute on the provision of services to the enclave's population, the authorities of Burgos and √Ålava reached a large-scale agreement in this respect. As of June 2019, two Basque parties, PNV and EH Bildu, rule in the two municipalities making up the enclave following electoral victories, with a key point in their agenda to incorporate Trevi√±o into √Ålava.

Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum. was a Swiss religious war which lasted from 5 January until 7 March 1656, at the time of the Old Swiss Confederacy. On the one hand were the Protestant cities of Z√ºrich and Bern, on the other the Catholic places in Central Switzerland. The Protestants tried to break the political hegemony of the Catholics, that had been in existence ever since the Second Kappel Landfrieden of 1531. The casus belli was the expulsion and execution of Protestants from the Schwyz commune of Arth. The Z√ºrcher unsuccessfully besieged the Central Swiss-allied city of Rapperswil and thereby drove their forces together. The Bernese were defeated and repelled in the First Battle of Villmergen. The Third Landfrieden ended the conflict and restored the pre-war balance of power.  Causes  During the Swiss peasant war of 1653, when the governments of the Protestant and Catholic cantons jointly moved against the insurgent peasants, the confessional differences that had existed for over a century were merely temporarily pushed towards the background. In 1654, the Z√ºrcher mayor Johann Heinrich Waser received the task of working out a plan to reorganise the Confederacy. However, the Federal Project of 1655 was rejected by the Catholics, because they saw a threat to their dominance in it. The difference between the religions surfaced once again. In September 1655, the enmities escalated when Protestants living in the Schwyz village Arth fled to Z√ºrich, after which the authorities confiscated their properties. Four of these \\"Nicodemite\\" were executed by the Schwyzers, three others were delivered to the Inquisition in Milan. On an extraordinary Tagsatzung in December, Z√ºrich demanded that those responsible be punished, that formal apologies be made and the dissolution of the Catholic Golden League founded in 1586. When these demands were ignored, Z√ºrich declared war on 6 January 1656. The Catholic towns in Central Switzerland promised Schwyz their support. On the Protestant side, only Bern gave its full-scale help, while Schaffhausen only provided troops for defence. Basel, Fribourg, Solothurn, Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Glarus, the Three Leagues and St. Gallen remained neutral.  War course  Even a day before the declaration of war, Z√ºrcher battalions marched to Rheinau to plunder the town and Rheinau Abbey. On 7 January, general Hans Rudolf Werdm√ºller led the Z√ºrcher main force to Rapperswil and laid siege to the city. Small units took Frauenfeld, Kaiserstuhl, Klingnau and Zurzach, others entrenched themselves at Oberwil and Kappel am Albis. The Schaffhausers lined up between W√§denswil and H√ºtten. Bern mobilised on 8 January and was initially on its own. About two thirds of its soldiers were needed to guard the borders with its Catholic neighbours. The remaining soldiers moved towards Aarau under command of general Sigmund von Erlach. They intended to join forces with the Z√ºrcher there, however, those were still engaged in the unfavourably developing siege of Rapperswil. From the Catholic side, Lucerne took supreme command of the army. All Lucernese and Zuger troops that were not already summoned to guard the borders, gathered in Muri and united at Boswil with battalions from the Freie √Ñmter. On 24 January 1656, the First Battle of Villmergen occurred. The Catholic troops surprised the Bernese army, that had arrived at Villmergen in the early evening. Despite their numerical and weapon-technical inferiority, the Catholics were able to repel them, to which the missing coordination among the Bernese contributed a large part. After the Z√ºrcher had attempted a final assault on Rapperswil on 3 February, they ended the siege without success. In the following weeks, several smaller skirmishes and attacks on the populace happened.  Consequences  France and Savoy mediated between the belligerents. Those concluded the Third Landfrieden on 7 March, in which they solemnly swore to cease combat and granted amnesty for misconduct committed during the war. Moreover, all troops were withdrawn, prisoners of war released and the erected redoubts were distmantled. Every canton obtained the right to maintain the status quo concerning religion. Controversial issues such as damage compensations were transferred to arbitral tribunal, but because of bad blood within the commission remained unresolved in many cases. The actual direct cause of the war, the Protestant refugees from Arth, was disregarded. In fact, the peace treaty confirmed the balance of power established by the 1531 Second Kappel Landfrieden, that is to say, the political dominance of the Catholic cantons within the Confederacy.

Cheshire, was an American businessman, foreign language interpreter and Consul-General of the United States to China. As the Chinese Secretary to legation during the Boxer Rebellion, Cheshire and other western diplomatic legations were under siege in Beijing until rescued by the China Relief Expedition. In the rebellion's aftermath, Cheshire was instrumental in the adoption of America's first educational exchange program with ChinaU.S.- China Educational Exchange: State, Society, and Intercultural Relations, 1905-1950 by Hongshan Li, Rutgers University Press, 2008 p. 55 and oversaw the commencement of trade relations between the two nations.San Francisco Call, Volume 98, Number 154, 1 November 1905 Fleming D. Cheshire served in the Consular Service of the United States for 38 years. He is the grand-uncle of jazz musician Andrew Cheshire.  Early life and career  Fleming Duncan Cheshire was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Jonas Cheshire, a ferry boat captain and later a Brooklyn court officer, and to Maria (n√©e Havens), a homemaker. He was named after Fleming Duncan, his father's friend and partner in the ferry boat business. Attending school at both public and private institutions, Cheshire completed his academic education in 1869. In the same year, he entered into the mercantile business in China working for Russell and Co. and Augustine Heard & Co. In 1870 he was sent by Augustine Heard and Co. to Peking to study Chinese.Men and Women of America: A Biographical Dictionary of Contemporaries.L.R. Hamersly, 1909 p.333 Cheshire eventually became fluent in both Mandarin and Cantonese, as well as other dialects. While learning Mandarin in Peking (Bejiing) he shaved his head, wore a pigtail, and dressed in traditional Chinese clothing. Cheshire thought that his facility with Chinese would not have been possible if he hadn't lived among the Chinese and adopted their way of life.The Deseret Weekly, Volume 50, 1895 He was appointed acting interpreter to the American consulate at Fuzhou in 1877 and was in charge of the consulate at Fuzhou in 1878-1879 and at Canton in 1879‚Äì1880. In 1882, Cheshire was appointed consulate-general in Shanghai and was acting interpreter to the American legation at Peking between 1884 and 1899.  The Boxer Rebellion  American legation at Bejiing circa 1901. (left to right) Edwin H. Conger, Fleming D. Cheshire, William E. Bainbridge, H.G.Squiers Cheshire (second from left) with Conger (center) reported as killed in Colliers weekly July 28, 1900 On May 6, 1900, someone hurled a rock through the window of the Presbyterian ministry at Peking, almost striking the head of one of the servants within. Acting as interpreter for ambassador Edwin H. Conger, Cheshire was sent to the Tsungli Yamen (the Chinese Foreign Office) to protest the incident. On the way Cheshire noticed that anti-foreign placards were being posted near the ministry by Chinese civilians and that the Boxers were practicing their acrobatics and sword twirling rituals in the neighborhood of the compound while the Chinese authorities did little or nothing to stop the acts.Thompson, Larry Clinton, William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2009, p.30. As the days progressed more attacks followed, becoming more pronounced and violent in nature. On June 19, the German minister was murdered en route to Tsungli Yamen by a Manchurian guard and with this news, all diplomats took refuge at the legation compound. During the 55-day siege, most civilians of the various foreign legations took refuge in the British Compound, which was larger and more easily defended than the rest. Cheshire was said to have displayed courageous and inspiring conduct within the walls of the compound joining a group of about 150 men to defend it. In the weeks ahead more violent attacks ensued and by late June, American newspapers were reporting that Congers, Cheshire, and all other Americans in Peking had been killed. By July 14, with more than one third of the legation killed or wounded, the Chinese government forwarded a conciliatory response thus marking the beginning to the end of the rebellion.  Later career  After the Boxer Rebellion, Cheshire served as the Chinese secretary to the special plenipotentiary (ambassador) of the United States, and was appointed consul-general at Mukden, Manchuria from 1904‚Äì1906. Unhappy with the general lack of security and relatively poor standard of living at the American consulate compounds in China, Cheshire returned stateside in early 1906 to meet with State Department officials about securing a portion of the indemnity collected from the Boxer Rebellion to erect dignified quarters for all those living within the walls of the American consulates throughout China. On July 1, 1906, Cheshire was nominated by Theodore Roosevelt as Consul-General at large, where he oversaw inspections at the various consulates throughout China. He kept this post until 1911. Cheshire's last appointment was as Consul-General at Canton from 1912 to 1915. One of the oldest members of the American diplomatic service and having lived amongst the Chinese for nearly four decades, Fleming D. Cheshire was considered one of the best interpreters in the Chinese empire.New York Times July 16, 1900 In 1899, Minister Edwin H. Conger wrote that \\"Mr. Cheshire has been with the legation [at Peking] for fifteen years, is more than fifty years old, and if he should resign, it would be almost impossible to fill his place.\\"Legends of San Kuan Miao: How the US Department of State's Chinese Language Program Began. William J. Cunningham FSO(Ret.)Center for International Studies, University of St. Thomas Coming from a mercantile background and being acutely aware of China's thirst for American goods, Cheshire often illuminated the huge potential for trade between the two nations by conferring with state department officials, lecturing American businessmen and granting interviews to the press.\\"TO GET CHINESE TRADE; American Consul General at Canton Makes Suggestions\\" New York Times, November 29, 1914  Final years and death  On a brief visit to New York in December 1915, Cheshire was stricken by paralysis brought on by a stroke.

History  Since the rediscovery of Tacitus's Germania in the 16th century, Germans have exalted the Germanic tribes as their direct ancestors. They especially praised German liberty defended by Arminius in 9 A.D. when three legions of the Roman Empire were defeated on Germanic soil, thus putting an end to Roman plans to subjugate Germania.Alexander Schmidt, Vaterlandsliebe Und Religionskonflikt: Politische Diskurse Im Alten Reich, Brill Publishers, p. 125. In Klopstock's poem, blood-stained Hermann returns from battle and is praised by his wife Thusnelda, who is happy about the death of the Roman soldiers. Her husband's victory heavily delights her making her confess that her love for Hermann has never been as ardent as now after the lurid fight. Arminius himself only regrets that Roman emperor Augustus has not been present as he would have slain him.

The Rice River and Wakefield Brook both flow through the community. Nearby places include McGregor, Thor, Lawler, Tamarack, and Rice Lake National Wildlife Refuge. Geography East Lake, located immediately east of Big Rice Lake, is located in section 20 of Spalding Township. The community had a post office from 1910 to 1953, operated by early settler Anthony Spicola. The community at one time was served by the Soo Line Railroad and had a railroad station and a sawmill. Today, the abandoned railroad grade has been converted into a recreational trail. History Ojibwe peoples lived in the area for centuries. Under the 1855 Treaty of Washington (10 Stat. 1165), an Indian Reservation for the Rice Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa was supposed to be established, but due to several lakes in the area all translated into English as \\"Rice Lake\\", the Rice Lake Indian Reservation was never platted. However, the Rice Lake Band claimed the intended \\"Rice Lake\\" was Big Rice Lake, located immediately west of the community. Because of the Big Rice Lake's prominent feature of having a groved island, the community is called in the Ojibwe language Minisinaakwaang (By the Groved Island). After the Rice Lake National Wildlife Refuge was established and forced removal of the Ojibwe peoples off the Refuge, the scattered Ojibwe population in the immediate area consolidated about the village and its train station. Community Today, East Lake serves as the administrative center for the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, District II.

It is the parish church of Beringen centre and the decanal church of the deanery of Beringen. The chancel, nave and transept are protected since 1949 and the neo- Gothic parts since 1993.Sint-Pieters-Bandenkerk Beringen History The church is a cruciform basilica with a western tower. The original church was destroyed in 1467 by Burgundian troops. A new church was built and subsequently devastated by fire in 1584 during the Eighty Years' War. The church was restored in 1592. The church was again destroyed in 1654, this time by Lorraine troops.De Inventaris van het Bouwkundig Erfgoed Parochiekerk Sint- Pieters-Banden (ID: 21415) The church was rebuilt and deacon Adriaen Wuestenraed played a major role in this reconstruction. In 1695 the church and the interior were completed. The interior was executed in Baroque style. The church tower collapsed in 1838 causing heavy damage to the nave and aisles. The reconstruction was carried out from 1842 to 1844. The aisles were restored in the then popular Neo-Gothic style, and a new west tower with a striking, slender spire was built.Omer Vandeputte, Gids voor Vlaanderen 2007, druk 1: toeristische en culturele gids voor alle steden en dorpen in Vlaanderen, Lannoo Uitgeverij, 2007, p. 141-142 A thorough restoration of the building and interior was conducted from 1998. Exterior The transept, the vestries and the choir date from the 16th century. The vestiges of iron sandstone in the present church are from the earlier church that was built in late Demer Gothic style, a local variation of the Brabantine Gothic. The Neo-Gothic parts of the church are in brick and limestone. The choir still has the original pointed arch windows. Interior Design of confessional in the northern transept by Artus Quellinus II The Baroque paneling, altars and at least three of the confessionals were produced by cabinetmaker Tillman Janssens and the sculptor Dani√´l van Vlierden from Hasselt. Three of the four confessionals can be attributed with certainty to van Vlierden on the basis of stylistic similarities with the confessionals that he made for the Dominican church in Maastricht (now in the Basilica of Saint Servatius). The facial expressions and the arrangement of the figures point in the direction of van Vlierden. One confessional in the northern transept is probably the work of the eminent Antwerp sculptor Artus Quellinus II, given the similarity with the design drawn by Artus Quellinus II himself. The sculpture of the Holy Sepulchre in the northern aisle of the church can also be attributed with certainty to van Vlierden. The main altar displays certain characteristics of van Vlierden‚Äôs expressive forms. However, it can not be attributed to him with certainty. The execution of the pulpit is certainly the work of another, less skilled sculptor.Martine Van Cauteren, 'De barokbeeldsnijkunst in het Land van Loon en een ‚Äòvergeten‚Äô beeldsnijder van eigen bodem', in: Vlaanderen. Jaargang 35. Christelijk Vlaams Kunstenaarsverbond, Roeselare 1986 The communion rails and part of the choir stalls were made by Laurens Vandenreyt (or Vandereyt) and date from the late 17th century.

It was designed by William A. Johnson Associates of Seattle, Washington, landscaped by Storrow Kinsella Associates of Indianapolis, Indiana and completed in 1998. The untitled neon sculpture located in Friendship Way is an outdoor sculpture by American artist Cork Marcheschi. The sculpture is owned and maintained by the city of Columbus. Description The walls of the alley are uniformly painted a cream color. Garden beds of English ivy occasionally line the brick pathway, and two rectangular trellises stand halfway down against the northern wall. Two classic wooden benches rest against the northern wall, as well as two distinctive red streetlights. The walkway is lined with two colors of brick, with horizontal stripes of light red bricks interrupting repeating sections of dark red-purple bricks. Many of the dark-colored bricks have names carved into them. Two rectangular granite plaques are embedded in the footpath at the Washington Street entrance to Friendship Way. The larger granite plaque reads the following in English and Japanese: \\"The bricks that form this walkway are a gift of friendship from Mayor Michio Tsukamoto and the citizens of Miyoshi, Japan.\\" The smaller granite plaque reads: \\"Friendship Way, Dedicated August 5, 1998 by Mayor Michio Tsukamoto, Miyoshi, Japan, Mayor Fred Armstrong, Columbus, Indiana.\\" =Sculpture= An untitled neon sculpture by Cork Marcheschi is mounted on the southern wall of Friendship Way. It is about 10 feet above the ground and extends for nearly 80 feet east to west. This abstract sculpture consists of colored neon lights housed in 13 multicolored, translucent Plexiglas shapes. For each shape, the Plexiglas panels are held together with an aluminum frame. The shapes include squares, rectangles, yellow circles, and a pink semi-circle with a circular void. While most of these shapes were fully lit by the neon within, the yellow circle contains neon in a spiral that rotates when fully operational. Other lights within the sculpture flicker or appear to move and are bright enough to be viewed during the day. Historical information In 1990, the city government supported the Streetscape project, a plan to redesign the public space on Washington Street, one of its important thoroughfares. New trees, brick walkways, and banners were included in the original Streetscape project. In 1998 the Streetscape project spread to the 400, 500 and 600 block alleys on the west side of Washington Street, including Friendship Way. The 500 and 600 block alleys are similar in design to Friendship Way, with bricks, English ivy and trellises, but they do not contain public art. In addition to the renovations of the alleys, drainage issues on Fourth and Fifth Streets were repaired. Landscaping of the three alleys was completed by Storrow Kinsella Associates of Indianapolis, Indiana. At the time of this project, William A. Johnson was the urban design advisor to Columbus. The name Friendship Way refers to the lasting friendship between sister cities Columbus and Miyoshi, Aichi, Japan. Citizens of Miyoshi contributed over $28,000 to pay for Marcheschi's neon sculpture by sponsoring engraved bricks used to line the walkway. Cork Marcheschi's untitled neon sculpture was chosen by a selection committee of interested local parties. Federal funds subsidized $99,000 of the total $130,000 of the redesign of all three alleys. The dedication of Friendship Way took place on Wednesday, August 5, 1998. Michio Tsukamoto and Fred Armstrong (then mayors of Miyoshi, Aichi and Columbus respectively), were in attendance. School children from both Miyoshi and Columbus assisted in cutting the ribbon, and Columbus students from Lincoln Elementary School sang two friendship songs in Japanese. The empty trellises were designed to trail honeysuckle and clematis, but as of 2014, they are empty. =Location history= Cork Marcheschi's neon sculpture is a site specific work created specifically for Friendship Way and was installed shortly after the alley's dedication in August 1998. Friendship Way is located in the 400-block of Washington Street in Columbus, Indiana. One entrance to Friendship Way opens between 416 and 424 Washington Street. The other entrance opens to the back of the public parking lot at Jackson and Fourth Streets. Artist Cork Marcheschi, from San Franscisco, received his MFA in Sculpture from the California College for Arts and Crafts in 1970. Marcheschi went on to teach at the University of California at Berkeley, San Francisco Art Institute, the Minneapolis College of Art and Design and the Tacoma Museum of Glass. Marcheschi's public work is displayed across America and Hong Kong. At the time of installation, this was Cork Marcheschi's smallest outdoor public sculpture.

Though largely self-educated, he received an honorary degree of A. M. from Yale College in 1817, an honorary Doctorate of Divinity from Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut in 1831 - an institution he co-founded - established the first public lectures in New Haven, and founded an evening school for the education of adult African-Americans in the city. He was a key figure in first amendment battles over freedom of the press and religious freedom. After abandoning politics for religion, he became the much respected Rector of Trinity Church on the Green in New Haven, Connecticut, for forty-three years, growing his church and establishing seven new churches within the original limits of his parish. Though he published fourteen books, and wrote newspaper articles as an editor and journalist weekly for eleven years, he is best known as an author for being the first person to define the word cocktail in print.  Life  = Early life = Croswell was born in West Hartford, Connecticut, on June 16, 1778. His immigrant ancestor Thomas Croswell (1633 - 1682) left Staffordshire, England, at the age of 22, and sailed to Boston, according to a biographer, \\"on account of the tumultuous state of affairs in that country, about the time of Cromwell's usurpation of the supreme power.\\"Olsen, Neil C.,The End of Theocracy in America: The Distinguishing Line of Harry Croswell's Election Sermon, including a transcription of A Sermon Preached at the Anniversary Election, Hartford, May 14, 1818 by the Rev. Harry Croswell, A.M., Rector of Trinity Church, New Haven, Nonagram Publications, , 2013, p. 35 The family thrived: they eventually owned a farm with a large house or \\"mansion\\" on Prospect Hill in Somerville, Massachusetts near Boston, which was later used by General George Washington as his headquarters during the 11-month siege of the British occupied city.Croswell, Simon Greenleaf, A memoir of the lives of some of the Croswell family, Boston, Printed by A.C. Getchell & son, c. 1916 Harry Croswell was one of eight children of Caleb Croswell (1735 - 1806) and Hannah Kellogg (1739 - 1829). Croswell's father, the sea captain and merchant Captain Caleb Croswell, was a member of the Connecticut militia at the time of the Revolutionary War. He fought in the disastrous Battle of Brooklyn and was captured by the British, who imprisoned him on one of the infamous British prison-ships. Croswell's father's health was ruined on the infamous prison ships The grim conditions in the ships ruined his health, and left the family impoverished. As a consequence, the Croswells were forced to send their children out to apprentice in a profession at an early age. Thomas O'Hara Croswell was apprenticed to the law school founder Tapping Reeve, though he later became a physician. Mackay Croswell was apprenticed to Hudson & Goodwin, printers of the Hartford Courant, and Archibald Croswell was apprenticed to a tanner. Harry Croswell, the fourth eldest son, was sent at age 10 as a servant in exchange for tutoring to a fellow native of West Hartford, the then lawyer but future lexicographer, Noah Webster.Dexter, Franklin B., Papers of the New Haven Colony Historical Society, Vol. IX, \\"The Rev. Harry Croswell, D.D., and his Diary\\", New Haven, 1918, p. 47 The arrangement lasted only a few months. Croswell was then tutored by the Rev. Dr. Nathen Perkins, the West Haven Congregationalist minister, before being sent to Warren, Connecticut, as apprentice clerk in a store in the small town. Croswell's older brothers Thomas and Mackay had moved to the then frontier town of Catskill, New York, on the banks of the Hudson River. There they opened a book and print shop in 1790. Harry left Warren and joined his brothers as an apprentice printer.Hobart, John Henry, The Correspondence of John Henry Hobart, New York:Priv. printed, 1912, p. 472 Mackay started a newspaper called The Catskill Packet in 1792. In the tradition of Benjamin Franklin, another man apprenticed to his brother, Croswell contributed anonymous humorous articles under the pseudonym \\"Titus Touchwood\\". His contributions were well written, satiric, partisan and very popular. His combination of high-minded politics (the Titus) and fiery, even savage indignation over injustice and folly (the Touchwood), made Croswell a man of influence in upstate New York.Olsen, p. 42 This \\"led to the recognition of his promise as a writer and finally to his installment in the editorial chair\\":Getlein, Edward, Here Will I Dwell, ed. Neil C. Olsen, Edition 2, New Haven, Trinity Church Publications, p. 67 In 1800, Croswell's name appeared alongside his brother as editor of the paper, now renamed The Western Constellation.Olsen, p. 40 View on the Catskill 1837 by Thomas Cole.jpg Mackay and Harry Croswell in their Catskill print shop mentored two other famous future journalists, whose rivalry would define New York state and national politics for half a century to come: Harry's nephew Edwin Croswell, the editor of the Albany, New York-based Democratic Party organ, the Albany Argus, was one of the founding members of the so-called \\"Albany Regency\\" who helped elect Martin van Buren president. Thurlow Weed was a rival publisher to Edwin Croswell; as a founder and influential leader of the Republican party, he helped elect Abraham Lincoln president.Olsen, p. 41 Town of Hudson, New York, in the early 1800s In August 1800, Harry Croswell married Susan Sherman of New Haven, Connecticut. They would eventually have seven children together.Croswell, Harry, A memoir of the late Rev. William Croswell, D.D.: rector of the Church of the Advent, D. Appleton & co., 1854, p. 13 In 1801, the young couple moved across the Hudson River to the town of Hudson, New York, a rapidly expanding deep port river town that would become the third largest port in the state. With two partners, Ezra Sampson, a retired Congregational minister, and George Chittenden, a paper maker, Croswell founded a book store and a print shop in the rapidly growing town. There he published books, and along with Ezra Sampson, edited the Columbia County, New York newspaper The Balance and Columbian Repository. = Battling for freedom of the press = New York was the swing state in the 1800 election that saw President Thomas Jefferson elected by one vote in the electoral college. Harry Croswell was a staunch Federalist, one of those who opposed Jefferson. When Connecticut newspaper editor Charles Holt moved to Hudson and founded the Democratic-Republican Party paper The Bee, Croswell countered by founding the Federalist paper The Wasp.Olsen, p.44 Croswell's political humor and darting jabs and stings at the President, New York Governor George Clinton, Attorney General Ambrose Spencer, and the rest of the Jefferson party apparatus down to the local sheriff and editor Holt, were so effective, that it was feared he would influence the election of 1804 against Jefferson. Jefferson wrote to one of his party's governors: Thomas Jefferson in 1800 The renowned case of the People v. Croswell began when Croswell published on September 9, 1802 an attack on Jefferson. The state's Democratic-Republican attorney General Ambrose Spencer indicted Croswell for a seditious libel as: Columbia Country courthouse, Claverack, NY The attempt to intimidate Croswell by prosecution for criminal libel backfired. It instead \\"resulted in the greatest advancement in press freedom in the history of America.\\"Olsen, p. 48 Croswell refused to back down, even after losing his first January 1803 trial at Claverack court house to political judges and packed juries. Though defended by local Federalist layers, including his friend William Peter Van Ness, he lost the second appeal trail under prominent anti-Federalist Justice Morgan Lewis in June 1803 as well. Despite facing enormous fines and jail, he kept up a barrage of attacks in his newspaper, and insisted on a third trial. It would be held at the New York Supreme court in Albany. Justice Morgan Lewis, later Governor of New York On February 13, 1804, the greatest Federalist lawyer, Alexander Hamilton, himself a newspaper editor as well, came up from New York to argue for the defense in the final trial in front of the New York Supreme Court. Croswell's lawyers based their case on the precept that \\"Truth is a defense against libel\\". Justice Lewis again presided, and was unlikely to overrule his own previous ruling, so all three judges would have to vote to overtrun the lower court's conviction. Persuaded by Hamilton's eloquence and forensic analysis, the single Federalist Justice James Kent was joined by Justice Thompson and Justice Henry Brockholst Livingston in voting for Croswell. For a short time it seemed Croswell and Hamilton had triumphed. However, Justice Lewis abruptly adjourned the proceedings. When the court reconvened, Justice Livingston announced he had changed his opinion, and now upheld the convicton. Two years later, on November 10, 1806, on the occasion of the next available position opening, Livingston was appointed to the U.S. Supreme court. Croswell's conviction stood. Attorney General and Judge Ambrose Spencer, who prosecuted Croswell in the early 1800s for attacking the ruling Jeffersonian party However, Justice Lewis was running for governor, and prosecuting journalists for telling the truth was unpopular. Croswell was never sentenced. Though he was eventually granted a new trial it never occurred since it was soon rendered moot. Even though Croswell and Hamilton had lost the case, the watching New York assemblymen who filled the galleries during the famous trial were so impressed by Hamilton's defense and Croswell's courage, that in 1805 they changed the state law on libel.Olsen, p. 51 Eventually, the other states followed, establishing the precept that truth was a defense against libel, when published with \\"good motives, and for justifiable ends.\\"Kent, James, Commentaries on American Law, Volume 2, Edition 2, O. Halsted, 1832, p. 21 Croswell continued to publish his paper. He was repeatedly sued not for seditious libel but for civil libel in a series of less well-known cases. Tried repeatedly by political judges and packed juries, and often losing, Croswell never surrendered or retreated. In 1806, he was sued by Solomon Southwick, the publisher of the rival newspaper Albany Register, the official printer for the New York government, for printing a cartoon showing \\"Sir Solomon Faucet\\" as a man plucking a goose identified as \\"the public\\". Former prosecutor Ambrose Spencer was now a trial judge; he convicted and fined Croswell. But it was not the Democratic-Republican party machine with its presidents, governors, attorneys general, justices, judges, prosecutors, lawyers, sheriffs, local officials, and party newspaper editors, that finally sank Croswell and drove him from publishing and politics. In the spring of 1811, Croswell was \\"unable to discharge a small debt to a creditor who was also a leading Federalist.Getlein, p. 68 The Federalist, an Albany, New York lawyer, sued, and Croswell was incarcerated until he could pay the debt. Disgusted now by both parties, he swore off politics. Influenced by the Second Great Awakening since 1809, he now \\"carefully examined the subject of the Christian ministry; and this examination led to his full conformity to the Episcopal Church, and he was baptized in St. Peter's Church, Albany, on Sunday, July 19, 1812.\\"Croswell, p. 13 On May 8, 1814, Bishop John Hobart of New York ordained Croswell a deacon, and he was placed in charge of Christ Church, Hudson, New York. = Separation of church and state in Connecticut = In the summer of 1814, Harry and Susan Croswell visited Mrs. Croswell's family in New Haven. The Rector of Trinity Episcopal Church on the Green in New Haven, the Rev. Henry Whitlock, was stricken with a fatal illness, and Deacon Croswell was asked to preach.Getlein, p. 70 After Whitlock died, Croswell as asked to take on the duties of leading the church. He took the pulpit on January 1, 1815, and five months later on June 6, 1815, he was consecrated a priest in Christ Church, Middletown, Connecticut by Bishop Griswold.Dexter, p. 50Vestry of Trinity Church, Obituary Sermon, Preached in Trinity Church, New Haven, March 16, 1858, At the Funeral of the Rev.

Trinity Church, the first Gothic Revival church in North America New Haven had long been the center of the established Congregationalist church in Connecticut. It was the home of Yale, known as \\"the School of the Prophets\\" for its fierce Puritan orthodoxy.Warch, Richard, School of the Prophets: Yale College, 1701-1740, Yale University Press, 1973, p. 195 The Puritans had fiercely resisted an Anglican church in the town since the town's founding in 1638. Relations between the Episcopalian minority and the Congregationalist majority had somewhat improved from the previous century, when mob actions, whippings, oppressive taxes, and restrictive laws were used to suppress Episcopalians in the state. At a town meeting in December 1812, the town granted the Trinity parish permission to build a new Trinity Church on the town Green. The church was designed by the architect Ithiel Town in the Gothic style. It was so impressive an edifice, it would launch the Gothic Revival style in North America. The cornerstone was laid in 1814. The church was consecrated at a public ceremony in 1816, which also saw Croswell installed as Rector of the church. However, in taking over the parish, Croswell had stepped into a major denominational controversy. The Congregationalist assembly, to protect their legislative majority, beginning in 1804 had passed a series of bills limiting suffrage - including banning blacks and those with no property, or even those with mortgaged property, from voting. In 1814, they reneged on a deal to give $60,000 to Congregationalist Yale and $10,000 to an Episcopal college in Cheshire, Connecticut, giving Yale $20,000 and the Episcopal College nothing. They then refused to grant a charger to the Episcopal college. Angry at their treatment, in 1815 the Federalist Episcopalians joined with the Democratic-Republicans to form the Toleration Party. They won the 1817 elections, obtaining a slim majority in the lower house and electing former Federalist Oliver Wolcott Jr. as governor, but did not take over the upper house. Expecting to win the upper house the next year, the Toleration Party began plans to call a constitutional convention to revoke the establishment of the church in the old Connecticut Charter. The much loved charter dated back to the Connecticut Royal Charter of 1662, signed by King Charles II, which was based on the Fundamental Orders of 1639, that in turn was based on a sermon given by the Rev. Thomas Hooker to the assembly in 1638, the year of Hartford's founding. Hooker in his sermon not only gave Connecticut a relatively democratic if established church charter, but a tradition of the Anniversary Election Sermon, where a prominent clergyman would be appointed to deliver a sermon to the governing bodies of the state. For 180 years, the clergyman appointed to give the politically important had been a Congregationalist minister. In 1818, Governor Wolcott instead chose the Episcopalian and ex-Federalist Harry Croswell to deliver the sermon. Having become disgruntled with not only the two parties, but party politics in general, Croswell did not deliver a partisan exhortation or preach the usual political bromides; instead he argued fiercely for the separation of church and state. In his \\"distinguishing line\\" sermon,Olsen, p. 67 he preached that citizens, state officials, and clergy, must render unto Caesar, the things which be Caesar's, but they must also render unto God, the things which be God's; they must respect the boundary between them by not crossing into each other's territory. The sermon was very well received; four editions were funded and printed that year by the assembly.Olsen, p. 79 The day after the sermon, the Assembly voted 81 to 80 that a simple majority would be enough to ratify the charter.Horton, Wesley, The Connecticut state constitution: a reference guide, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1993, p. 11 In October, the new constitution disestablishing the church was ratified by a slender majority. = Parish minister = The Rev. Dr. Harry Croswell, of Trinity Episcopal Church on the Green in his sixties Obeying his own precept, Croswell never publicly commented on politics nor voted in an election in the 43 years he was Rector of Trinity parish. He rarely even mentioned the political issues of the day in the diary he kept for most of the years he held his office.Getlein, p. 79; see also Croswell's obituary in the New Haven Daily Register, March 13, 1868 Croswell's 5,300 page diary, begun in 1821 when he was 41, is a largely untapped treasure found in manuscript form at the Yale library. The historian Franklin Bowditch Dexter in \\"The Rev. Harry Croswell, D.D., and his Diary\\", called it \\"a remarkable record of individual activity, and of the shrewd comments of a critical observer on persons and events within his daily experience.\\"Dexter, Franklin B., Papers of the New Haven Colony Historical Society, Vol. IX, \\"The Rev. Harry Croswell, D.D., and his Diary\\", The Tuttle, Morehouse & Taylor company 1918, p. 50 According to the African-American history scholar Randall K. Burkett, Rector Harry Croswell was known to minister to blacks at a time when other white clergy did not. Among the American diocesan clergy, Burkett notes that \\"none had more extensive or intimate acquaintance either with his own black parishioners or with a larger number of the twenty-two antebellum African-American Episcopal clergy than did the Reverend Harry Croswell,\\" and that Croswell \\"all but singlehandedly ministered among the black population of New Haven.\\"Burkett, Randall K., Emory University, \\"The Reverend Harry Croswell and Black Episcopalians in New Haven, 1820-1860\\", The North Star: A Journal of African American Religious History ( ), Volume 7, Number 1 (Fall 2003), p.1 His charitable works in the city ranged from co-founding Washington College in New Haven (now Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut), New Haven's first Orphanage, several night schools, Sunday schools, the Colonization Society, and he was a trustee and secretary of the General Theological Society.The Christian Journal, and Literary Register, Volume 5, T. & J.

London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson. p. 217. then aged only 18. Wyburd's Spanish Moorish and Arab-influenced furniture designs proved to be both fashionable and popular. By the late 1890s, Wyburd was at the forefront of European furniture design, combining elements of Art and Crafts, Art Nouveau and other medieval English allusions. Liberty furniture was typically of solid oak or mahogany, well yet simply made, sometimes with small cut-outs, stained glass insets or elaborate beaten copper hinges. Wyburd's designs were often given Saxon or Scottish names. One was the Athelstan chair, of around 1899. The Liberty Studio closed in 1905, but Wyburd had already left in 1903 to establish his own Wigmore Street studio in London. His later commissions included redesigning the drawing room at Rosslyn Tower, St John's Avenue, Putney, London. He also created a design for an interior at Riverside House in 1904 which featured a selection of typical Arts and Crafts furniture. It has been said that but for his apparent reluctance to seek recognition for his work, he might today have the same level of recognition as Charles Voysey and Baillie Scott. In later life, Wyburd was a London antique dealer, which trade he carried on for many years. Personal life On 14 July 1900, Wyburd married Eleanor Oldershaw Bathurst (1876‚Äì1976), at St Mary Abbots, Kensington, London.

UE BOOM has been praised for its industrial design, loudness, battery life, speakerphone capability, and its suitability for outdoor use, but criticized for its comparatively high price. The speaker was first announced on May 21st 2013, and went on sale in the United States and Europe later that month. On September 15th 2015, Ultimate Ears introduced the UE BOOM 2, a revised model of the UE BOOM. The new model features IPX7 waterproofing, a 25% increase in volume, and superior wireless range over the original model. _Main article: UE Boom 2._ The third revision, UE BOOM 3, was announced on August 30th, 2018 with a personalized version of the speaker announced on March 4th, 2019 .  Design and features  The speaker is an elongated cylinder measuring , similar in shape to a canned beverage, and weighing . It is coated in a water- and stain-resistant material and partly covered with rubber. The speaker comes in several colorways, including a limited edition designed by painter Kenny Scharf. The design and cylindrical shape was described by iLounge as \\"different from most competitors and yet consistent with both prior UE Boombox designs\\". UE BOOM consists of two drivers at 4 Œ©, and has two passive radiators measuring . In terms of sound output, it supports a maximum of 88 dBA in a range of 90 Hz‚Äì20 kHz. On one end, it has a removable D-ring, which one reviewer suggested might be used to hang the device like a lantern. In addition to supporting Bluetooth, the speaker can be connected via a standard 3.5mm audio input. It also supports passive NFC, can be used as a Bluetooth speakerphone and has an alarm feature. Additionally, two speakers can be paired to one source, with each speaker playing back a separate channel, or both speakers playing both channels. A recently released firmware update enabled a feature called \\"PartyUp\\" which allows a person to pair 150+ UE Boom, Boom 2, and MegaBoom speakers, and have them all playing music from a single source.http://www.ultimateears.com/en- us/partyup  Critical reception  CNET rated the UE BOOM four stars out of five, favoring it as versatile, durable, portable and loud. CNET also commented that, like most small speakers, the UE Boom \\"just doesn't deliver a ton of bass\\", and that at higher volumes, the UE BOOM may distort \\"bass-heavy material\\". Will Greenwald reviewed the UE BOOM for PC Magazine, remarking favorably on its design, volume and stereo pairing function. He noted that there was emphasis on the low-midrange tones. Greenwald also noted that the UE BOOM \\"doesn't exactly impress\\" in terms of low frequency sound. In testing the claim that the UE BOOM produced \\"360-degree sound\\", he noted that the speaker's imaging did not suffer with different placement or listening position. A reviewer for the New Zealand Herald praised it for ease-of-use and quality of sound. In 2014, UE BOOM received an iF product design award in the audio category.

Billed as an \\"interactive dance party duo\\" and described as \\"the Beastie Boys meet Sesame Street\\", Koo Koo Kanga Roo showcase a colorful live show that relies heavily on audience participation, featuring overtly silly sing-along songs that are typically accompanied by their own individual dance move. The duo has toured nationwide, performing for both children's events and at mainstream music clubs with rock and punk bands. Overview Koo Koo Kanga Roo have defined themselves foremost as a live band, with their performances and audience interaction being the pure core of the group, even more so than their recorded music. Bryan and Neil are the only members of Koo Koo Kanga Roo, and thus perform all of their songs against pre-recorded backing tracks played from their iPods over the venue's PA system. The duo's songs are written explicitly for the purposes of audience participation, featuring sing- along verses and/or choruses often utilizing a call and response technique, and almost always including a simple dance move unique to each song that Bryan and Neil encourage the audience to follow along with. The subject matter of Koo Koo Kanga Roo's songs rarely stray from juvenile \\"goofball\\" territory, covering such topics as cats, dinosaurs, letters of the alphabet, ninjas, food fights, fanny packs, hopscotch, slumber parties and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Despite this, Bryan and Neil hesitate to label themselves as a \\"kid's band\\", instead referring to Koo Koo Kanga Roo as \\"a kid's band for adults\\" that aims to connect with all ages. \\"We shoot for goofy, more than kids' music specifically\\", Neil elaborated. \\"It's not about being a kids' thing, it's about being a fun thing\\". Neil has also mentioned that Koo Koo Kanga Roo's songs try to touch on a nostalgia factor for older audiences, drawing on his and Bryan's memories of childhood; one prominent example includes the duo's tradition of throwing a playground parachute into the crowd at the end of their sets, the kind \\"that you remember from PE class in elementary school\\". Appropriately, Koo Koo Kanga Roo's merchandise table is just as mired in kid-friendly activity, regularly including such features as a station to make friendship bracelets - where Bryan and Neil strictly enforce a rule that if someone makes a bracelet, they must give it to a person they've never met before - and the \\"Koo Koo Kamera\\", a webcam where concert attendees can take their pictures together and have them uploaded to the group's website. Koo Koo Kanga Roo also sells a variety of unconventional merchandise, ranging from official coloring books to a \\"mustache-on-a-stick\\". With the exception of Whoopty Whoop and their \\"greatest hits\\" compilation Rad- trospective, none of Koo Koo Kanga Roo's music is sold in a physical format, as the group prefer to release all of their recorded music through \\"pay what you want\\" downloads on their website, essentially making the entirety of their catalog available for free. According to Bryan, all of their songs are written expressly for their live shows and the audience participation that accompanies them, and thus are never considered outside of that specific context. Although Bryan once said \\"I'm surprised people can even listen to those songs [outside of performance]\\", Neil stressed the importance of releasing their music by itself because \\"[w]e want people to have access to the songs so that they can sing along at the shows. We want them to know all the words. We want people to have the music as immediately as possible\\". Biography The genesis of Koo Koo Kanga Roo occurred in 2004, when Bryan and Neil met while occupying the same student dormitory at Saint Mary's University of Minnesota. Bonding over their similar tastes in music, the two became quick friends, eventually studying abroad in London and backpacking through Europe together before ultimately deciding to start a band. The duo first formed what they described as an \\"accessible, non-threatening\\" \\"folky pop\\" ensemble, something they've since derided as a generic and forgettable endeavor. Following that group's disbandment, Bryan and Neil realized they found being in a traditional band a \\"boring\\" experience, and set out to start a new musical project together that would be radically different, emphasizing dance-based theatricality, audience interactivity and an unapologetically goofy sense of humor. \\"We wanted to be entertaining, and have a good time\\", Neil explained in an interview with The A.V. Club, \\"That's the premise behind Koo Koo Kanga Roo: including everyone and having a good time\\". Despite starting out having absolutely no tangible plans or ideas of how to execute this project, Bryan and Neil kept developing the concept until it evolved into what became Koo Koo Kanga Roo, drawing various influences from the likes of Of Montreal, The Flaming Lips, Best Fwends, The Cool Kids and Flight of the Conchords. Along with a consistent output of recorded music, Koo Koo Kanga Roo built up a strong word of mouth following by releasing numerous comedy sketches and music videos on YouTube, as well as through relentless local touring, playing venues ranging from traditional music venues and 21+ clubs to children's birthday parties, preschools and elementary schools, to weddings, nursing homes and church basements. In 2009, the group began touring out of state, eventually striking up a touring relationship with the family-friendly superhero rock band The Aquabats, playing numerous shows with them across the nation in 2010 and 2011, as well as accompanying them on tour supporting ska punk band Reel Big Fish and a ten-day stint performing on the Yo Gabba Gabba! live tour. As the group regularly performs in front of adult audiences on tour, Koo Koo Kanga Roo have met with a polarizing reception from punk and rock crowds, leading the Dallas Observer to label them \\"the epitome of the love them or hate them musical act\\". In the fall of 2013, Koo Koo Kanga Roo were selected to be the opening act on an American tour with popular folk punk artists Frank Turner and The Smith Street Band, where the duo played before large venues to audiences that were typically hostile towards their seemingly out-of-place appearance. \\"People don't know what to make of them\\", Turner mentioned in an interview, \\"They've booed them. I don't care. I love them\\". When asked how the duo responds to hecklers, Neil replied \\"We ask people who are having a good time to go over and hug those angry guys\\". On October 2, 2013, Koo Koo Kanga Roo independently published their own children's book, Unicorns R Real, which was followed shortly thereafter by the DVD release of House Party with Koo Koo Kanga Roo, a tongue-in-cheek \\"dance-a-long\\" workout video featuring seventeen of the group's songs. Early the following year, it was announced that the duo had signed to Fun Fun Records, a children's music-oriented offshoot of noted indie punk label Asian Man Records, to release their third full-length album Whoopty Whoop, which was officially released on May 14. In the summer of 2014, Koo Koo Kanga Roo again supported The Aquabats on the East and West coast dates of their \\"20 Year Anniversary\\" tour, and in September they returned to the United Kingdom as part of a sixteen show tour opening for Frank Turner. In 2012 Koo Koo Kanga Roo partnered with GoNoodle (a media platform used in the majority of elementary schools in the US) to distribute and co-create videos for a number of years, introducing the group to a huge number of teachers, kids, and parentshttps://www.gonoodle.com/for-families/. Some of their more well-known material was created during the partnership with GoNoodle included \\"Milkshake\\"https://family.gonoodle.com/activities/milkshake, \\"Pop See Ko\\"https://family.gonoodle.com/activities/pop-see-ko, \\"Pop See Ko 2.0\\"https://family.gonoodle.com/activities/pop-see-ko-2-dot-0, \\"Roller Coaster\\"https://family.gonoodle.com/activities/roller-coaster, and \\"Dino Stomp\\"https://family.gonoodle.com/activities/dinosaur-stomp.

There are numerous ways to implement this with the most common being to determine a range that the search key resides in and performing a binary search within that range. This takes O(log i) where i is the position of the search key in the list, if the search key is in the list, or the position where the search key should be, if the search key is not in the list. Exponential search can also be used to search in bounded lists. Exponential search can even out-perform more traditional searches for bounded lists, such as binary search, when the element being searched for is near the beginning of the array. This is because exponential search will run in O(log i) time, where i is the index of the element being searched for in the list, whereas binary search would run in O(log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the list.  Algorithm  Exponential search allows for searching through a sorted, unbounded list for a specified input value (the search \\"key\\"). The algorithm consists of two stages. The first stage determines a range in which the search key would reside if it were in the list. In the second stage, a binary search is performed on this range. In the first stage, assuming that the list is sorted in ascending order, the algorithm looks for the first exponent, j, where the value 2 is greater than the search key. This value, 2 becomes the upper bound for the binary search with the previous power of 2, 2, being the lower bound for the binary search. // Returns the position of key in the array arr of length size. template int exponential_search(T arr[], int size, T key) { if (size  0) { return NOT_FOUND; } int bound = 1; while (bound < size && arr[bound] < key) { bound *= 2; } return binary_search(arr, key, bound/2, min(bound + 1, size)); } In each step, the algorithm compares the search key value with the key value at the current search index. If the element at the current index is smaller than the search key, the algorithm repeats, skipping to the next search index by doubling it, calculating the next power of 2. If the element at the current index is larger than the search key, the algorithm now knows that the search key, if it is contained in the list at all, is located in the interval formed by the previous search index, 2, and the current search index, 2. The binary search is then performed with the result of either a failure, if the search key is not in the list, or the position of the search key in the list.  Performance  The first stage of the algorithm takes O(log i) time, where i is the index where the search key would be in the list. This is because, in determining the upper bound for the binary search, the while loop is executed exactly \\\\lceil \\\\log(i) \\\\rceil times. Since the list is sorted, after doubling the search index \\\\lceil \\\\log(i) \\\\rceil times, the algorithm will be at a search index that is greater than or equal to i as 2^{\\\\lceil \\\\log(i) \\\\rceil} \\\\ge i. As such, the first stage of the algorithm takes O(log i) time. The second part of the algorithm also takes O(log i) time. As the second stage is simply a binary search, it takes O(log n) where n is the size of the interval being searched. The size of this interval would be 2 - 2 where, as seen above, j = log i. This means that the size of the interval being searched is 2 - 2 = 2. This gives us a run time of log (2) = log (i) - 1 = O(log i). This gives the algorithm a total runtime, calculated by summing the runtimes of the two stages, of O(log i) + O(log i) = 2 O(log i) = O(log i).  Alternatives  Bentley and Yao suggested several variations for exponential search. These variations consist of performing a binary search, as opposed to a unary search, when determining the upper bound for the binary search in the second stage of the algorithm. This splits the first stage of the algorithm into two parts, making the algorithm a three- stage algorithm overall. The new first stage determines a value j', much like before, such that 2^{j'} is larger than the search key and 2^{j'/2} is lower than the search key. Previously, j' was determined in a unary fashion by calculating the next power of 2 (i.e., adding 1 to j). In the variation, it is proposed that j' is doubled instead (e.g., jumping from 2 to 2 as opposed to 2). The first j' such that 2^{j'} is greater than the search key forms a much rougher upper bound than before. Once this j' is found, the algorithm moves to its second stage and a binary search is performed on the interval formed by j'/2 and j', giving the more accurate upper bound exponent j. From here, the third stage of the algorithm performs the binary search on the interval 2 and 2, as before. The performance of this variation is \\\\lfloor \\\\log i \\\\rfloor + 2 \\\\lfloor \\\\log(\\\\lfloor \\\\log i \\\\rfloor + 1)\\\\rfloor + 1 = O(log i). Bentley and Yao generalize this variation into one where any number, k, of binary searches are performed during the first stage of the algorithm, giving the k-nested binary search variation. The asymptotic runtime does not change for the variations, running in O(log i) time, as with the original exponential search algorithm. Also, a data structure with a tight version of the dynamic finger property can be given when the above result of the k-nested binary search is used on a sorted array. Using this, the number of comparisons done during a search is log (d) + log log (d) + ... + O(log d), where d is the difference in rank between the last element that was accessed and the current element being accessed.

After Rev. George Whitefield preached at Bruton Parish Church at Williamsburg during the First Great Awakening, and his sermons were published, local mason Samuel Morris built a reading room or log cabin near Mechanicsville in rural Hanover County. In 1743, Virginia's colonial assembly permitted religious dissenters four meeting houses: three in Hanover County (including this one) and one in Henrico County; they were sometimes called \\"Morris churches\\".Polegreen story Pennsylvania Presbyterian missionary Samuel Davies, one of the first non- Anglican ministers licensed in Virginia, evangelized in Hanover County and used this as his base from 1743 to 1759. Patrick Henry attended services here with his mother, and credited Davies for his oratorical skills. In 1755, Davies helped organize what came to be known as the Hanover Presbytery, encompassing all Presbyterian ministers in Virginia and North Carolina. He also became known for writing hymns, and for educating slaves (unlike Methodist and Baptist evangelists). During the American Civil War, battle lines formed on opposite sides of Totopotomoy creek during the 1864 Overland Campaign as the Union army advanced on Richmond. Polegreen Church stood between them. A Confederate artillery shell fired to dislodge Union sharpshooters by a man whose father had been baptized at Polegreen hit the wooden building, which burned to the ground. The congregation could not afford to rebuild it.Polegreen StoryHistoric marker, available at http://www.churchesofvirginia.org/pole_green_church/index.htm An open-air design of steel beams painted white to show the historic structure's former dimensions has been erected at the site, along with a visitor center and signage concerning religious persecution and freedom in Western civilization.

In 1850, she owned half of the land in Oregon's state capital Salem. Life Clark (sometimes Clarke) was born on April 16, 1818, in East Windsor, Connecticut. She was educated at the Wilbraham Academy. At the age of 21, she sailed from New York on the ship Lausanne in what was known as Jason Lee's \\"Great Reinforcement\\" of recruits for the Methodist Mission in Salem, Oregon. She married William H. Willson, credited as the founder of Salem, Oregon, on August 16, 1840, at the Nisqually Mission. It was the first wedding of American citizens in western Washington. The two had three daughters: Frances, Laurabelle, and Kate Augusta Lee. Chloe Clark Willson became the first teacher of the Oregon Institute, which was founded after the failure of the Indian Manual Training School. When the Institute opened, Willson was the only teacher, as well as housemother for five white students, the children of settlers. She remained the sole teacher for two years. The board of the Institute decided to lay out a town on the school's land, with the intent to sell lots to fund the school, and attract settlers to the area. The 1846 decision named Dr. William H. Willson as the business agent and landholder for the town he named Salem. When the Donation Land Claim Law of 1850 passed, it meant the 640 acres held by Willson belonged jointly to him and his wife, Chloe. William was bound to the Oregon Institute's board to administer the land, but Chloe was not, leading to controversy which was settled in 1854 with a compromise: the property was split in half along State Street, with the 320 acres South of the street belonging to the Institute (later Willamette University), and the 320 acres North belonging to Chloe. This northern land would eventually be home to the Oregon State Capitol. William H. Willson died in 1856, prompting Chloe to move back east for her daughters' schooling. She returned to Salem in 1863 to serve as the Governess of the Ladies Department at Willamette University. Willson may be best known for her diary, which chronicled her journey to Oregon on the ship Lausanne and her life as a missionary teacher, as well as her later life, and is a valuable resource for historians. In 1935, the diary was donated to Willamette University (the successor to the Oregon Institute) by her son-in-law Joseph K. Gill.

The road travels east from Nome, following the shore of the Bering Sea until it reaches the ghost town of Solomon. From there, the route travels northeast through the interior of the Seward Peninsula before it terminates on the south bank of the Niukluk River, south of Council. One of three highways traveling from Nome to surrounding communities, the highway is disconnected from the rest of the Alaska Highway System. The route is unpaved for its entire length and becomes impassable for automobiles in the winter outside of a short portion immediately outside of Nome. The portion of the road between Nome and Solomon is part of the Iditarod Trail and the highway passes several historic sites associated with the trail and the area's gold mining history. The route began as a collection of informal trails connecting Nome with mining communities established on the peninsula at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1906, the Alaska Road Commission constructed a wagon road along most of the length of the trails from Nome to Council. Because of the value of the gold coming from the Council area, this road quickly became the main artery for the region and the Road Commission spent significant amounts of money improving and maintaining the route into the 1930s. However, the road had fallen below state standards by the 1960s and 70s and projects were undertaken to update the highway and replace river-crossing ferries with bridges. The road has been studied since the 1950s as part of a potential Fairbanks-Nome Highway; the expected cost of such a project has consistently prevented any development. Route description The Nome-Council Highway near Nome The Nome-Council Highway begins at a T intersection with Nome Bypass Road and Front Street; the former route travels north from the intersection and forms a partial loop around the main built-up area of Nome, while the latter extends westward from the intersection along the Nome seawall into the city. The highway travels southeastward from this intersection, parallel to the Bering Sea. For the first mile, the route passes East End Park Ponds to the north, a city park which contains the Swanberg Dredge and is an important point for bird migration. After approximately , the highway intersects Kougarok Road, another state highway, which travels northward to the Kougarok River south of the community of Taylor. After milepost 2, the road bends northeastward around the mouth of the Nome River. On the east bank of the river, the route intersects West Fork Road, East Fork Road, and Fort Davis Road, all of which lead to the former site of Fort Davis, a U.S. Army facility operated during the Nome Gold Rush. The area now hosts scattered houses and fishing huts. The roadway returns to following the coastline for a few miles, before it bends and continues slightly inland. Along this stretch, the highway passes a few quarries. Between miles 12 and 14, the road again follows the shore, traveling around Cape Nome, a large headland. alt=A picture of the airport at Solomon, Alaska, along the Nome-Council Highway.

The Holy Spirit Orphanage (Dutch: Heilige Geest- of Arme Wees- en Kinderhuis) was an orphanage in the city of Leiden in the Netherlands. It is a Rijksmonument located on Hooglandse Kerkgracht 17B.  Origin  The building of the orphanage in the 20th century. The so-called ‚ÄòHeilige Geest‚Äô (Holy Ghost or Holy Spirit) was the name of a charitable institution, originating in France, which cared for the poor and needy. In the Dutch city of Leiden the ‚ÄòHeilige Geest‚Äô was responsible for regular distribution of food, clothing, and small amounts of coin money. It began in Leiden shortly before 1316 with a group of ‚ÄòHeilige Geestmeesters‚Äô (Masters of the Holy Spirit) connected with the Leiden parish of Saint Peter.  Orphanage  Around the year 1450, the institution purchased a former mansion on the Breestraat, opposite the street currently known as the Papengracht. Initially the building served as an office and warehouse. In 1491 the building was repurposed and became a home for needy and parentless children. This marked the establishment of the ‚ÄòHeilige Geest- of Arme Weeshuis‚Äô. Soon, the number of children housed in the orphanage exceeded capacity, forcing the Heilige Geestmeesters to look for a larger building. A new accommodation was found in 1583 in the building of the Vrouwengasthuis (woman‚Äôs hospital) on the Hooglandsekerkgracht. The Heilige Geest Orphanage would remain at this location for almost four centuries. The building complex would undergo three major renovations in this period. The most important of these took place between 1774 and 1778. The merging of the nearby Arme Kinderhuis (Poor Children‚Äôs Home) with the Heilige Geest Orphanage necessitated this renovation. The names of the respective institutions were also joined in the unwieldy designation ‚ÄòHeilige Geest- of Arme Wees en Kinderhuis‚Äô. It was by this name that the orphanage was known well into the twentieth century.  Present day  Weeshuis, present appearance The Heilige Geest Orphanage remained on the Hooglandse kerkgracht until 1961, still carrying out its mission to care for Leiden‚Äôs poor and needy children. The institution became a foundation in 1979 now known as ‚ÄòStichting Heilige Geest- of Arme Wees- en Kinderhuis te Leiden‚Äô, caring for the poor and destitute youth in a wider sense. In 1968 the building became a Rijksmonument, a Dutch national heritage site. At the end of the twentieth century, to further promote the study of its history, the foundation commissioned a new inventory of the archives of the Heilige Geest Orphanage, which dates back to the fourteenth century, as well as a study of the building history and the realization of the score of the Music for Christmas 1796 composed by Christian Friedrich Ruppe for the mixed youth choir of the orphanage.

It employs local ionization by a pulsed laser and subsequent mass analysis of the generated ions. Methods In laser microprobe mass analysis, a highly focused laser beam is pulsed on a micro sample usually with a volume of approximately 1 microliter. The resulting ions generated by this laser are then analyzed with time-of-flight mass spectrometry to give composition, concentration, and in the case of organic molecules structural information. Unlike other methods of microprobe analysis which involve ions or electrons, the LMMS microproble fires an ultraviolet pulse in order to create ions. As a result, this method is much better at detecting qualitatively rather than quantitatively. Advantages LMMS is relatively simple to operate compared to other methods. Furthermore, its strength lies in its ability to analyze biological materials to detect certain compounds (such as metals or organic materials). Sample preparation LAMMA is particular about the sample which is used. The sample must be small and thin. Ionization of too much material results in a large microplasma whose time spread and ion energy distribution entering the mass spectrometer can result in undesired peak deformation.

He was a passionate supporter first of Napoleon and later of the Bourbons, and an impressive force in the courtroom. He was a Deputy from 1822 to 1824. Lawyer Louis Antoine Fran√ßois de Marchangy was born in Saint-Saulge, Ni√®vre, on 25 August 1782, son of a bailiff. He excelled in classical studies, and won a scholarship from the department of Ni√®vre to study at the school of law of Paris. After qualifying as a lawyer, he joined the magistracy. At the same time, he continued literary studies. In 1808 he was appointed assistant judge at the Court of the First Instance of Paris. In 1813 he published his first work, la Gaule po√©tique, a two-volume study of the history of France in terms of its poetry, speeches and beaux-arts. This book made his reputation. Six editions were published between 1813 and 1826. Marchangy was an enthusiastic supporter of Napoleon, and was made Imperial Crown prosecutor at the court of the Seine in 1810. The first trial that won him public attention was that of Vigier, founder of the baths on the Seine, who was subjected to a capital charge. After Napoleon's fall Marchangy became an equally enthusiastic royalist, and was appointed Crown prosecutor for the Bourbon monarchy. He acquired a great reputation, although he did not improvise and even wrote down his speeches. He combined passion with close reasoning, and his services were highly valued by the government. Marchangy was most distinguished in political trials. His conclusions in the trials of two writers, Joseph Fi√©v√©e in 1818 and Nicolas Bergasse in 1821, were not supported by everyone. Even his biographer, generally very favorable to Marchangy, noted that through his method of interpretation and clever phraseology he could make out that a writer said what he had never written or thought. The liberal party accused Marchangy of using the same techniques at the trial of F√©ret, editor on l'Homme gris and of P√®re Michel, in the trial of the four Sergeants of La Rochelle and others. His merciless indictment against the sergeants of La Rochelle earned him the office of Advocate General at the Court of Cassation. In this indictment he referred to Joseph M√©rilhou, lawyer for one of the accused, when he said, \\"Here the real culprits are not those in the dock, but those on the benches of advocates.\\" Politician On 20 November 1822 Marchangy ran successfully for election as Deputy for Ni√®vre, supported by the ultra-royalists. The same day he was also elected deputy for the Nord department. His admission was challenged on the grounds that he did not qualify on the basis of property ownership. The Ministry of Justice did not dare to interfere in the hot debate that followed. Eventually his double election was annulled. On 17 April 1823 Marchangy was replaced in Ni√®vre, but the same day was elected for the Nord. He took his seat and voted with the extreme right. He was reelected on 25 February 1824 for the Altkirch constituency of Haut-Rhin, but his election was again annulled. Marchangy's Tristan le voyageur, ou la France au quatorzi√®me si√®cle appeared in six volumes in 1825-26. He died of a chill on 2 February 1826 after a memorial ceremony on January 21. He was aged forty four. Works Marchangy's literary works were soon forgotten. They included: *La Gaule po√©tique ou l'Histoire de France consid√©r√©e dans ses rapports avec la po√©sie, l'√©loquence et les beaux- arts (1813) *Bonheur de la campagne, po√®me en quatre chants *Si√®ge de Dantzig en 1813 (1814) *M√©moires historiques pour l'ordre souverain de Saint-Jean de J√©rusalem (1816) *Tristan le voyageur, ou la France au quatorzi√®me si√®cle (1825‚Äì1826) References Citations Sources Category:1782 births Category:1826 deaths Category:French lawyers ","title":"Louis Antoine Fran√ßois de Marchangy"},{"id":"42285950","text":"Maffin Bay, known as Teluk Maffin in Indonesian, is a small bay in the Pacific Ocean on the Northern coast of New Guinea.

Puedo prometer y prometo (Spanish \\"I can promise, and I do promise...\\") is a classic catchphrase said by Spanish politician Adolfo Su√°rez, first said in the first post-Franco general elections in Spain in 1977. The phrase, which was initially derided by some comedians soon became a definitive accolade for choosing Suarez and is remembered as one of the symbols of the Spanish Transition subsequently being used in popular parlance for both political and journalistic purposes. Background Caudillo Francisco Franco died on November 20, 1975. Two days later, Juan Carlos I was proclaimed King of Spain at the Palacio de las Cortes palace in accordance with the provisions of the Spanish law of succession referendum, 1947. The first government under King Juan Carlos I kingdom was headed by Carlos Arias Navarro and failed in the attempt to transform Spain into a democracy, getting overwhelmed by the many demonstrations against it. So, in July 1976, Adolfo Su√°rez was appointed Prime Minister by the King. Despite not having initially public support, Su√°rez managed to unite all democratic forces to develop a process of reform that allowed turning the Spanish State into a Western democracy. With that in mind it was enacted the Political Reform Act of 1977, the last of the Fundamental Laws of the Realm which had gone ahead through concessions made by the Government of Su√°rez and supported by the President of the Cortes Espa√±olas, Torcuato Fern√°ndez- Miranda, which had been approved in the Spanish political reform referendum, 1976, the project received the approval of 94.1% of voters. The Government, in agreement with the provisions of Royal Decree-Law 20/1977 of March 18 called for elections by universal suffrage for a new bicameral Parliament, to be held on June 15, 1977. In turn, they ensured that these elections were fully democratic and counted with the presence of the left through measures such as the legalization of the Communist Party of Spain, the dissolution of the Movimiento Nacional or extension of the amnesty. Speech The phrase, designed by Su√°rez speechwriter (and later his presidential Communication Director) , was part of the discourse of Adolfo Su√°rez, as candidate of the Union of the Democratic Centre, which was part of the free spaces that electoral political parties arranged to go to citizens in the closing of the election campaign, June 13, 1977. This speech, broadcast by RTVE, was the one that closed the election messages and was introduced by a tune whose lyrics said: \\"Vote center, vote Su√°rez, vote freedom. The sure path to democracy\\". Adolfo Su√°rez subsequently appeared on screen, uttering his discourse, with a first part relating to the promises fulfilled Once Su√°rez had referred to the promises he had kept he used the formula \\"I can promise, and I promise...\\" to give strength to his speech Legacy Logo of Union of the Democratic Centre. The inclusion of the \\"I can promise and I do promise\\" formula in the final speech of the election campaign has been considered a posteriori as a key factor in the victory of the Union of the Democratic Centre, since a victory of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party was also considered possible. Su√°rez managed to identify UCD with himself (hence the use of the first person in the phrase) providing strength to a party which later (with Su√°rez's resignation in 1981) proved to be very unstable.

He then joined Dundee United, scoring on his debut against Celtic against Celtic on 14 August 1965. After 6 appearances he soon dropped out of first team contention but spent two seasons at the club, playing over 50 times for the reserves. He was released in April 1967. He joined Coleraine in Northern Ireland, then later in season 1967-68 also played for Queen of the South. In his 12 league appearances for Queens he scored 6 goals.

Shaik Jalaludeen realised how difficult it would be for the poor and the downtrodden to travel and pursue their higher studies. He decided to make his hometown itself a place of higher education.

Madarasa Trust, formed by Haji Khadir Mohideen Maraikayar, with his brothers, to preserve and utilize 1,500 acres of land in Adirampattinam for the purpose of providing religious education through madarasas to religious and linguistic minority students by founding several educational institutions at Adirampattinam.

The song also features uncredited vocals from French rock artist Iz√Øa. Music video The music video was released on December 20, 2013. At the beginning of the video, Orelsan receives a Skype call from Ablaye, who is asking about the progress of a music video he had asked for. Orelsan assures him that it is almost ready, and after the call, Orelsan and Gringe take turns recording themselves using a GoPro camera in their apartment, as they rap the song and perform activities in line with the song's lyrics. At the same time, Iz√Øa can be seen singing and acting in a fictional children's television series on several screens around the apartment. At the end, the video is rewound to the beginning and a blueprint of the video's direction is revealed on-screen, as Orelsan is heard saying, \\"Alors, on a trois minutes, un appartement rempli de bordel...euhm...bon, non c'est compliqu√©...\\" (\\"So, we have three minutes, an apartment full of stuff everywhere...um...actually it's complicated...\\"). A making-of of the music video was released on 7 January 2014.

The track features Natasha Khan, known professionally as Bat for Lashes. The track is produced by both Albarn and Richard Russell, whom Albarn has previously worked with on Bobby Womack's comeback album The Bravest Man in the Universe and on the DRC Music album Kinshasa One Two. Background On 18 January 2014, the Warner Music Store was updated to include Damon Albarn's new album and its name was revealed ‚Äì Everyday Robots. The deluxe edition of the album came packaged with a DVD of Albarn performing a few album tracks live at Fox Studios in Los Angeles. The DVD was filmed on 3 December 2013. On the next day, the album's information was removed from the website, which made many believe it was not supposed to have leaked so soon. In a January 2014 interview with Rolling Stone, Albarn revealed that Natasha Khan will appear on the track \\"The Selfish Giant\\" as a \\"ghostly echo\\", and that Brian Eno had collaborated on the album's final track. Natasha Khan (Bat for Lashes), appears as a \\"ghostly echo\\" on \\"The Selfish Giant\\" Albarn said in an interview: \\"I wrote the songs, but Richard Russell was a fantastic editor and did a lot of the atmospheric stuff, so in a sense it's not entirely my record. It is my narrative, and my voice and my songs. I started off giving Richard a lot of songs, 60 or 60-plus ‚Äì he had the editorship.\\"name=\\"rollingstone.com\\" Speaking of her contribution to Everyday Robots, Bat for Lashes' Natasha Khan said: \\"If I could go back and tell the 15-year-old me that I'd just sang with Damon for his new record, she'd probably wet her pants with excitement, I had such a massive crush on him [...]\\". In 2013, Khan had supported Albarn's band Blur at the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Dublin, Ireland. In 2014, Albarn revealed that the inspiration for the song came from Blur's visit to the Scottish town of Dunoon in 1995 and a view he had of the Holy Loch. \\"It was a beautiful misty evening,\\" he remembers.\\"Damon Albarn on how Dunoon inspired debut album\\" ‚Äì The Scotsman, 26 April 2014 \\"There was a single submarine in the loch ‚Äì why it was there I don't know. I had a very strong image of the loch and submarines and walking down the main drag in Dunoon after the gig, going to someone's house for a party, and a song came out of it.\\" The song includes the line \\"walking down Argyll Street when the evening colours call\\". Albarn also stated: \\"Now every time I sing \\"The Selfish Giant\\" I go back to that night in Dunoon, which was a really great night, a fantastic night.\\" When asked if he would consider playing solo in Scotland, he replied: \\"I‚Äôd love to. Maybe Dunoon? Then I can walk down Argyll Street again.\\" It is the second-longest song on the entire album, behind \\"You and Me\\". The song contains a sample of \\"The Selfish Giant\\", composed by Kenny Clayton, written by Oscar Wilde and performed by Robert Morley. Promotion Albarn also confirmed that he will play a series of \\"intimate gigs\\" in support of the album at the Rivioli Ballroom in Crofton Park on 30 April, followed by a show at the People's Palace in Mile End on 1 May, in which he will also play songs from his bands Blur, Gorillaz & The Good, the Bad & the Queen. Both dates would come shortly after the release of the album itself. Albarn was the subject of a half-hour episode of The Culture Show broadcast on BBC Two in February 2014, which focused on his previous bands and his current work. In the programme he returned to his former homes in Leytonstone, East London, and Colchester, Essex. Speaking in the programme, he revealed that he found his first solo LP tough, saying: \\"I've spent so long in bands, playing to large groups of people, that doing a solo album is quite a difficult thing for me to do. That's why I put it off for so long.\\" Speaking about being raised in London, he said: \\"Growing up in multi-cultural London in the 1970s played a big part of who I am.\\" The documentary included clips of songs from his album as well, including 'Hollow Ponds', 'Hostiles' and 'Mr. Tembo'. It also featured a clip of Albarn's father, artist Keith Albarn, showcasing an interactive installation on a 1960s episode of Tomorrow's World. It was also revealed by on Damon's official Twitter account, that his live band will be called The Heavy Seas, and will feature guitarist Seye, drummer Pauli the PSM, guitarist Jeff Wootton and Mike Smith on keyboards. Although the record will be released under his name, he said he wanted himself and his backing band to be known as The Heavy Seas. The band's first performance was at the BBC Radio 6 Music Festival. \\"This is our first ever gig and it's quite nerve-wracking to be not only playing your first gig but playing it live on radio as well,\\" he told the crowd at the venue and the audience of 6 Music listeners. \\"But I suppose I should be used to it after all these years.\\" The gig also saw the first exclusive plays of songs such as \\"The Selfish Giant\\" and \\"Mr. Tembo\\", Albarn also played Tomorrow Comes Today from Gorillaz eponymous debut album and The Good, the Bad & the Queen single \\"Kingdom of Doom\\" as well as \\"El Ma√±ana\\" from Demon Days and the Blur B-Side \\"All Your Life\\". \\"The Selfish Giant\\", itself was particularly well received, and many people praised Khan's vocals that ebbed through in the live performance. Critical reception In his track-by-track review, Matthew Horton of NME said: \\"\\"Celebrate the passing drugs/Put 'em on the backseat while they're coursing through your blood\\" ‚Äì yes, 'The Selfish Giant' is about a nuclear submarine. Well, that's hard to get a grip on (\\"Waiting for the final call that's coming down the line,\\" maybe?), but what 'The Selfish Giant' really sounds like is a refined goodbye over dub bass and piping organ, drifting into a chorus that's devastating in its ordinary heartbreak: \\"I had a dream you were leaving/It's hard to be a lover when the TV's on/And nothing's in your eyes\\". The sort of thing you hope isn't autobiographical.\\" Dan Cains of The Sunday Times wrote: Featuring the treated voice of Bat for Lashes‚Äô Natasha Khan on its chorus and opening with Albarn essaying a serpentine jazz motif on the piano, this track contains the album‚Äôs deadliest lyric (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to be a lover when the TV‚Äôs on and nothing‚Äôs in your eyes‚Äù), which Albarn fought to have edited out, being later over-ruled by Russell. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be like ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt be singing this, Richard. I can‚Äôt deal with the responsibility of that line.‚Äù And he went, ‚ÄòNo, no, no, that‚Äôs one of the best things you‚Äôve written.‚Äô My missus (the artist Suzi Winstanley) was always like, 'I don't like that line.\\" I'm not surprised. I don't like it either. It's just not cool.\\" Beneath the lyric, sonorous piano chords plod; above it, an eerie, bird-like clarinet screeches before dropping like a stone.

Life Born at Ardwick Green, Manchester, 7 December 1788, he was the fourth and youngest son of Robert Markland, a textile manufacturer there; his mother was Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Hibbert of Manchester. At age 11 he was sent for his education to the house of the headmaster of Chester school. Markland was trained as a solicitor in Manchester, but in 1808 roved to London and practised there. In 1814 he was appointed by the West India planters their parliamentary agent, and in the same year entered as a student at the Inner Temple. He remained in London in practice, being the head partner in the firm of Markland & Wright, until 1839, when he retired to Malvern. In 1841 he moved to Bath, Somerset and spent the rest of his life there. Markland was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1809, and from 1827 to April 1829, when he resigned the post, acted as its director. He joined the Roxburghe Club at its second meeting (1813), when it was enlarged to 24 members, in 1816 became Fellow of the Royal Society, and on 21 June 1849 was created D.C.L. of the University of Oxford. Markland co-owned with John and Thomas Hibbert four sugar plantations in Jamaica and Barbados. When the British government emancipated the slaves in the 1830s, Markland and his partners received compensation to the tune of over ¬£25,000 each for the liberation of over 400 slaves in their ownership.https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/45822 Also a supporter of church societies, Markland was entrusted by Mrs. Ramsden with the foundation of mission sermons in Cambridge and Oxford, and while he was resident in Bath three ladies, the Misses Mitford of Somerset Place, selected him for the distribution of ¬£14,000 in charitable works in England and the colonies. Markland died at his house, Lansdown Crescent, Bath, on 28 December 1864, and was buried in the new Walcot cemetery on 3 January 1866, the first window in Bath Abbey west of the transept being filled with glass to his memory.

It is a basically linear district, running along Canaan Street roughly from Prospect Hill Road in the north to Moss Flower Lane in the south. The town flourished first as a stagecoach stop, and then as a resort colony in the late 19th century. The historic district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. It included 60 contributing buildings. History The town of Canaan was established by a land grant in 1761, but Broad Street, its principal road now called Canaan Street, was not laid out until 1788. Because it was on a major north-south stagecoach route, the area developed in the first half of the 19th century as a trading center. The old town hall was built in the 1790s to serve as a church, and was joined by institutional buildings including the 1828 Greek Revival Old North Church and the 1839 Canaan Union Academy (later to become the town library and museum). Several of the houses originally served as taverns, catering to the stagecoach trade. The area declined in economic importance because it was bypassed by the railroad, but was developed as a summer resort community in the second half of the 19th century, rivaling Bethlehem. With (#7 shows the Canaan Union Academy) Description The historic district is basically linear, running along Canaan Street as it passes just west of Canaan Street Lake. Its northern boundary is Prospect Hill Road, where the Old North Church stands. Built in 1828, the Old North Church is a fine example of early Gothic Revival architecture. A cluster of civic buildings is found near the center of the district at Apple Blossom Road, where the old town hall stands, with the former Academy (now the Canaan Historical Museum) across the street. Most of the district's buildings are residences that exhibit either Federal or Greek Revival styling, reflective of the village's early period of development.

She was launched on 19 March 1874. On her first trip she would be the largest ship steaming from the Netherlands. She was expected there in early May. In early April it became known that delivery would be delayed and Prinses Amalia would leave the Netherlands in June. On 6 June 1874 Prinses Amalia made her trial runs on the Clyde, reaching about 12 knots. That same evening she left Greenock for Nieuwediep (Den Helder) On 10 June 1874 SS Prinses Amalia arrived in Nieuwediep.  Characteristics  = Dimensions = SS Prinses Amalia was 383 feet long, 40 feet wide and had a draught of 31 feet 6 inches. The cargo size of the ship was 3,500 tons. = Machinery = The compound steam engines were also delivered by the shipyard. The nominal power of the engines was 400 hp. There were two direct acting cylinders, one of 86 inch diameter, the other of 50 inch diameter., each with a stroke of 3 feet 6 inch. There were also steam engines to drive the anchor winch and other winches. = Accommodation = SS Prinses Amalia had place for 76 first class passengers, 32 second class passengers, and some third class passengers. Near the bow of the ship was a section for soldiers. It was the least comfortable part of the ship, with soldiers sleeping in hammocks. Behind the soldiers section were the cabins for the 32 second class passengers. These were grouped around a saloon, which was also used to dine. A pantry was available to serve dinner in this saloon. It was also used to serve drinks. Any non-commanding officers would be transported in the second class. The first class was in the rear of the ship. Any military officers would be housed in the first class. The first class saloon was partly gilded and had painted panels. This room had three big tables to seat the 74 first class passengers. Every first class cabin had two washstands, so that of the three or four gentlemen that shared a cabin at least two could freshen themselves at the same time. There were also cabins for families with internal doors to children's cabins.  Service  Prinses Amalia was one of the earliest steamers to operate in the Amsterdam - Java service (inaugurated by SMN in 1871), spending her entire service life on this route. On her maiden voyage to the Dutch East Indies SS Prinses Amalia carried many parts of Batavia Dock. This iron floating dry dock was transported to the Dutch East Indies in parts, and would be assembled on Untung Jawa (Amsterdam Island). On 16 June 1874 Prinses Amalia sailed from Nieuwediep for Southampton, Naples and ultimately Batavia. In the evening of the 17th she arrived in Southampton. On 19 June she left Southampton again. On 29 June she arrived in Naples, from whence she left on the morrow. On 2 July she was at Port Said. On 6 July she left Suez. On 24 July 1874 Prinses Amalia arrived in Padang. On 31 July she arrived in Batavia. It was a swift voyage, and without all the stops, it would have been the fastest trip from Nieuwediep to Batavia up to that date. Fate She was broken up at Genoa in 1906 having been renamed Amalia for her final delivery voyage.

From 2001 to 2012, Belaventsev was director of EMERCOM, a Russian state agency that manages the humanitarian efforts of the Ministry of Emergency Situations. He served under Minister of Emergency Situations Sergey Shoygu. During his tenure, Belaventsev founded private companies that were awarded ministry contracts to implement international humanitarian projects. According to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, Belaventsev's companies received hundreds of millions in state contracts from the government agencies where he was employed. Belaventsev owns a 60% stake in Zarubezhtehcomproekt (ZTPP); others with 10% stakes include current EMERCOM director Alexander Mordovskiy, EMERCOM accountant Tamara Mikhailova, and Sergey Ivanov, who was Belaventsev first deputy at EMERCOM. In 2012, Belaventsev followed Shoygu to Moscow, where he led the General Affairs Department of the Moscow Region Governor and Moscow Region Government. After Shoygu was named Minister of Defense, Belaventsev became general director of Slavyanka, among the largest ministry-controlled companies. Crimean officials reported that Shoygu advised Vladimir Putin to appoint Belaventsev as his envoy to Crimea. On 21 March 2014, Belaventsev was appointed Presidential envoy (Plenipotentiary Representative of the President of the Russian Federation in a Federal District) of the newly created Crimean Federal District.–ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω –Ω–∞–∑–Ω–∞—á–∏–ª –ø–æ–ª–ø—Ä–µ–¥–æ–º –ø—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –†–§ –≤ –ö—Ä—ã–º—Å–∫–æ–º —Ñ–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–º –æ–∫—Ä—É–≥–µ –û–ª–µ–≥–∞ –ë–µ–ª–∞–≤–µ–Ω—Ü–µ–≤–∞, Itar-Tass, March 21, 2014.

Built about 1796, the house is most notable for the high quality folk murals drawn on its walls, most likely by the itinerant artist Rufus Porter between 1825 and 1830. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The Daniel Carr House is located in a rural setting in northern Haverhill, on a dirt lane extending west from a 90-degree bend in Brier Hill Road about northeast of New Hampshire Route 10. The house is a connected farmstead, with a 2-1/2 story main house, from which a series of ells extend northward and then east to a barn. The main block is five bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by pilasters and topped by a transom window and corniced entablature. The first ell, also two stories, is probably older. The interior follows a center hall plan, with parlors on either side of the center hall, where a staircase rises to the second floor. The western parlor, as well as both levels of the hall, feature painted and stenciled artwork on their walls, above wooden wainscoting and chair rails. The parlor is painted in multiple colors, with scenes that include the Portland Observatory and a cluster of houses on an island. The panels in the hall and stairwall are monochrome and less elaborate. The border stencilwork in these rooms is a careful reproduction of the original stencilwork, which has deteriorated and is now encapsulated under a layer of skimcoat plaster. The main block of the house was built c. 1825-30, probably by John Carr, and was attached to an earlier 1-1/2 story structure built by Daniel Carr c. 1796, which was rebuilt in the 1980s. The murals drawn on its walls are most likely by the itinerant artist Rufus Porter, and were probably drawn between 1825 and 1830, when Porter is known to have been working in this region. The house underwent a major restoration effort in the 1980s after standing vacant for two decades, and as of 2014 remained in Carr family hands.

The school serves students from grades 9-12. This school is not a regular secondary school because this school uses a selection process to draw eighth graders from various middle schools in Plano ISD. The school is an alternative to the regular high school experience by offering collaborative team projects, more STEAM classes and the ability to attend classes without structured class periods. This school is one of the three Academy Programs in Plano ISD. The others are the Plano ISD Health Sciences Academy and The IB World School at Plano East. Campus The building is a three-story, former office building that belonged to Bell South, and later, AT&T.;Ayala, Eva-Marie. \\"New Plano ISD Academy High School taking shape\\" (Archive). The Dallas Morning News. Retrieved on June 2, 2015. In the summer of 2013, the PISD renovated the building and turned the building into a creative learning school. The school is an open floor plan school with classrooms that are dubbed Learning Spaces. There are three science labs, a fabrication lab, three presentation rooms, library, and conference rooms. The school also contains two dedicated soundproof rooms for student and club use. Curriculum The Plano Academy was designed for experimental project learning and advanced studies. Students graduating by senior year will have at least two endorsements. As part of the curriculum, all students graduate with the same coursework. There is 1:1 technology at the Academy. Some notable projects include developing and zoning a plan for the city of Plano, creating a fruit-juice company and planning the production and development, designing school curriculum, and launching projectiles. Students are able to work independently with their group with less teacher interference. Junior and seniors will also take courses offered by Collin College, that is college credit and high school credit, similar to Advanced Placement. Beginning in senior year students will be required to make an in-depth and wide-reaching capstone project. =Academics= The school offers the basic classes required to graduate in the state of Texas. It also offers optional classes; calculus, Spanish, French, and digital media. Beginning in senior year students have the option to not take an art-credit to put more time towards their capstone. Unique types of classes called \\"project- time\\" or \\"capstone-time\\" are used to give students independent work times with teacher facilitation. = Unique Terminology = The Academy has over the years adopted and begun traditions of using unique terms to describe parts and places in the school. Grade levels, rather than being called; \\"freshman, sophomores, etc.\\" are referred to as \\"first-years, second-years, etc.\\". Class periods are referred to as schedule blocks called \\"mods\\". Due to the unique space of the Academy, rather than calling each divided space a classroom, they are called \\"learning spaces\\". History The Academy Visioning Committee started designing the plan for the school in 2010. Texas Instruments, Huawei, and other companies, endowed the new school. In 2013, PISD held a lottery to determine which students are able to attend. In the first year of Academy's opening, students were learning multiple classes combined into a single project. Student-led organizations and PTSA also hosted several fundraising and school events such as the Winter Social, and the paintball tournament. The Academy has also allowed visitors from around the Dallas community to see the school's learning environment. The Academy's first graduating class graduated in the spring of 2016. Clubs The Academy offers over 20 clubs. Most clubs meet during school time. NHS and student council meet after school each week as well. Clubs include journalism, film, solar car, and many other interests. =Robotics Club= The Titan Robotics Club won the Rookie All-Star Award at the 2015 Dallas Regional FRC Competition. Team 5431 went on to Nationals in St. Louis, Missouri (from April 22‚Äì25, 2015) and made to Carver Field Quarterfinals. Titan Robotics entered in the Lone Star and Dallas Regional FRC competition in 2016. Team 5431 went on to Nationals in St. Louis, Missouri (from April 22‚Äì25, 2016) and made to Carver Field Quarterfinals. In 2017, Titan Robotics competed in the FIRST Steamworks competition, going to the Dallas and Brazos Valley regionals. They were wild-carded and went on to Nationals in Houston and made it to the Hopper field playoffs.

In July 2013, the Cleveland City Council passed the Street Performers Ordinance, also known as the Sax Man Legislation, which explicitly allows \\"acting, singing, playing musical instruments, pantomime, juggling, magic, dancing, reciting and clowning\\" on Cleveland streets for money. Days later, Reedus played a reunion concert with his former band, Sly, Slick and Wicked, at the Cleveland House of Blues, where Cimperman presented him with the legislation.

Azumi is an adaptation of Y≈´ Koyama's manga series of the same title, and was followed by the sequel Azumi 2: Death or Love in 2006.  Plot  As in the manga, the old master Jiji is tasked by the Tokugawa shogunate to raise a band of assassins. Their task is to finish off Toyotomi Hideyoshi's three allies: Nagamasa Asano, Kiyomasa Kato and Masayuki Sanada, to prevent an outbreak of the new civil war. Azumi is discovered as a little girl kneeling without visible emotion next to the body of her dead mother by Gessai and his entourage of young students. She is then raised by him in the martial skills of sword fighting and the art of assassination. Azumi and her classmates, now at young adult age, are constantly being told about a \\"mission\\" they must accomplish, though they have no idea what this mission is yet. Prior to setting out on their mission, their master orders his students to \\"pair up\\" with each other's best friend and proceed to kill each other, thus out of ten students only five will remain to proceed with the mission: Azumi pairs with and is forced to kill Nachi. More questions and internal conflicts begin to arise amongst Azumi and her comrades as it seems their mission even prevents them from saving a village of mostly women and children from being massacred at the hands of a group of bandits, as they need to keep a low profile in order to achieve their primary mission. The first leg in their mission, assassinating Nagamasa Asano, goes well. Upon hearing about Asano's death, Kato tasks his general Kanbei Inoue with his safety. Kanbei assesses the threat with a convoy containing a body double of Kato, in which his company fails to keep the double alive. The group of young assassins is given leave to see a small traveling circus troupe, where Hyuga falls in love with Yae, one of the troupe's actresses. After his assessment, Kanbei enlists help from three rogueish brothers who, eventually confuse Yae's circus troupe for the assassins, slaughtering them all until Hyuga, Azumi, and Nagara arrive. By the time the three dispatch the rogues, only Yae is left alive. Kanbei then sends his monkey-like henchman Saru to make a deal with the insidious and narcissistic mercenary named Bijomaru Mogami, previously imprisoned and under constant guard. Kanbei promises Bijomaro that should he successfully kill the assassins, his past crimes will be forgotten. Bijomaru agrees and quickly gets to work hunting down the five assassins, with Saru as his guide. Bijomaru's bloodlust, much to the chagrin of Saru, is such that he often kills allies in battle along with his enemy. As Hyuga walks his beloved Yae back to the main road after saving her from the three brothers, he is confronted by Saru and Bijomaru, and a battle between the assassin and the mercenary ensues. During the battle, Bijomaru uses psychological warfare in addition to swordplay as he explains to a frightened Hyuga that his sword does not contain a hand-guard since he has never had to defend another's blow. As Hyuga lays bleeding and defeated, Bijomaru forces Yae to watch him toy with the dying boy. Saru, uncomfortable with this lack of respect for another warrior, finishes Hyuga off as an act of mercy, and gives Yae leave to bury him. Azumi soon finds Yae by Hyuga's body, and Yae manages to convince her that the violent lifestyle must be left behind. Together they begin a journey over the mountains and out of the valley to go and live in peace with Yae's kin in Tangou. Yae socializes Azumi during the journey, dressing her in a kimono and adorning her with make-up, perfume and hair treatment. Just as they begin to get comfortable during their journey, a band of brigands finds them as they sleep, and attempts to gang rape the young women. Azumi, who has not slept beside her sword as her training normally dictated, is caught off guard, but eventually steals the sword of a would-be captor, killing all of the brigands and saving Yae. The experience leaves Azumi understanding that she must obey her training, and complete her mission. She sets off to find her master and comrades, and tells Yae that she will meet her later, in Tangou. Meanwhile, the master, Nagara and Ukiha attempt to strike another target. The plan is foiled when it is revealed that the enemy has sprung a trap, reinforcing his samurai with common mercenaries. The master is captured and placed on a cross in anticipation of Azumi's arrival. She finds Kato's compound and starts her attack by turning some cannon on the area. She then proceeds through the compound, wreaking havoc enough to attract and impress Bijomaru, who decides to warm up by attacking the common mercenaries while Kanbei and Kato escape to sea. The mercenaries then attack Saru's men, and Azumi's task is made easier by the infighting. A final battle takes place between Azumi and Bijomaru, where he claims he is forced to defend for the first time. Upon Bijomaru's defeat, Azumi releases her dying master from the cross and he uses his last breath to tell her to abandon their mission and go live her life. Later, Kanbei and Kato are on their boat, congratulating each other about overcoming the assassin threat and plotting their next move against Tokugawa Ieyasu. Azumi appears as if from nowhere, and finishes the warlord in one blow, diving into the sea immediately afterwards. Kanbei is stricken with disbelief and frustration and lashes out at his men. Azumi then returns to the scene of her epic battle with Bijomaru to find that Nagara had indeed survived and has just made his way out from the rubble he was buried under during the battle. The two resolve that, having killed Asano and Kato, they will complete their mission, and pursue Sanada.

It consists of braised beef tenderloin served in thin watery sauce made from a mixture of garlic, vinegar, kecap manis (sweet soy sauce), Worcestershire sauce, water, and spiced with nutmeg and black pepper. It is served with hard boiled egg and vegetables such as string beans, potato, tomato, lettuce, cucumber, cauliflower or broccoli and carrot, and topped with potato chips and some dash of mustard or mayonnaise on the side. Despite its Javanese name ‚Äî Selat Solo ‚Äî that denote \\"salad\\", its centerpiece is the chunk of beef (preferably tenderloin) that makes this dish hardly a salad, it is more likely to be categorized as a type of braised beef steak in Javanese mildly sweet watery sauce. Some might describe this dish as the cross-over between beefsteak, salad and soup. This dish sometimes also called as Bistik Jawa (Javanese beefsteak), although Javanese beefsteak could refer to another similar dish with less watery sauce. History During colonial Dutch East Indies era, European colonizers brought with them European ingredients and their cooking technique. Some of Javanese upperclass ningrat (nobles) and educated native Javanese were exposed to European cuisine; such as breads, cheeses and beefsteak, this cuisine was held in high esteem as the cuisine of the upper class of Dutch East Indies society. This led to adoption and fusion of European cuisine into local Javanese cuisine, such as the development of Selat Solo recipe in Surakarta, the heart of Javanese court of Surakarta Sunanate. It is believed that the recipe was the fusion; a local Javanese adoption of European beefsteak. The trace of European influence can be seen in the use of mustard or mayonnaise and Worcestershire sauce, while the Javanese preference of mild sweetness can be tasted in the use of kecap manis (sweet soy sauce).

He gets his resume and strolls into the city, dodging cars and enters a building with his scheduled resume appointments. He enters a room filled with a bunch of angry people staring at him. When the attendant calls Bob's name, he nervously walks to the office with the people still staring down at him. Just as he arrives at the office, the attendant instantly kicks him out. The singing pigs appear again, giving him a second chance. This time, Bob becomes aggressive and grows into a muscular size. He barges into a boss's office and attacks him, throwing him into a wall.

Originally trained in Spain, where he won seven races, he was later moved to France where he became an outstanding performer over staying distances, winning the Prix du Cadran and Prix Royal Oak as a four-year-old in 1987. In the following year he won the Prix de Barbeville and the Prix Vicomtesse Vigier before being controversially disqualified after winning the Ascot Gold Cup. After a break of more than three years he was sent to the United Kingdom to compete in Hurdle races and won the 1992 Champion Hurdle. He collapsed and died after finishing fourth at Leopardstown Racecourse on 30 December 1992. Background Royal Gait was a bay gelding with a small white star and a white sock on his left hind leg bred by Ian H Wills. He was sired by Gunner B, who won the 1978 Eclipse Stakes before becoming a successful National Hunt stallion. His other major winners included the Grand National winner Red Marauder and the World Hurdle winner Iris's Gift. Royal Gait's dam, High Gait, was a granddaughter of the Irish Oaks winner Merry Mate, who was, in turn, a daughter of the Ascot Gold Cup winner Gladness. As an unraced two-year-old in March 1985, Royal Gait was sold at Doncaster for 5,500 guineas. He was sent to race in Spain where he was owned by Manuel Pereira-Arias and trained by Gerardo Villarta. Racing career =1986: three-year-old season= As a three-year-old, Royal Gait won four races in Spain, including the Gran Premio de San Sebastian and one minor race in the French provinces. =1987: four- year-old season= In the early part of 1987, Royal Gait won three races in Spain, including two Group Three races in Madrid before being sent to France to contest the Group One Prix du Cadran over 4000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 24 May. He was given little chance and started the 36/1 outsider in a field of nine runners. Ridden by Olindo Mongelluzzo he was restrained in the early stages before taking the lead in the straight and won by a length from the 6/4 favourite Satco. The gelding then finished second to the mare Tailga in the Gran Premio de San Sebastian and second to Yaka (conceding 11 pounds) in the Prix Gladiateur. In October, by which time he was being trained in France by John Fellows, Royal Gait returned to Longchamp for the Group One Prix Royal-Oak over 3100 metres and started the 19/10 favourite in a field which included runners from France, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and Norway. Ridden by Alfred Gibert, he took the lead 400 metres from the finish and drew away in the closing stages to win by eight lengths from Spruce Baby. =1988: five-year-old season= Royal Gait began his 1988 campaign by beating a field which included Satco and Yaka in the Group Three Prix de Barbeville at Longchamp on 4 April. He won by two lengths despite conceding weight to his ten opponents. Three weeks later, over the same course, he conceded seven pounds to Satco and won the Group Two Prix Vicomtesse Vigier by a short head. On 22 May he attempted to win his second Prix du Cadran, but after appearing to have a good chance of repeating his success of the previous year, he swerved to the left in the closing stages and was beaten half a length by Yaka. On 16 June, Royal Gait was sent to contest Britain's most prestigious stayers race, the Gold Cup over two and a half miles at Royal Ascot. Cash Asmussen took over the ride from Gibert, and the gelding started the 15/2 fourth choice in the betting behind Sadeem, Primitive Rising and Sergeyevich. He was not among the early leaders but moved up to fourth place on the turn into the straight. At this point, El Conquistador, who had been acting as a pacemaker for Sadeem, dropped back sharply and collided with Royal Gait who was moving up on the rail. El Conquistador stumbled badly and unseated his jockey Tony Clark. Royal Gait continued his run on the inside, took the lead approaching the final furlong, and drew away to win by five lengths from Sadeem with a gap of fifteen length back to Sergeyevich in third. Royal Gait's winning time of 4:15.67 broke the existing course record by more than three seconds. The racecourse stewards held an inquiry into the race, concluded that Asmussen had been responsible for bumping El Conquistador and disqualified Royal Gait. The result of the inquiry has been described as \\"among racing's greatest bungles\\". Fellows described the result as \\"difficult to believe\\". On his final appearance of the season, Royal Gait was dropped back in distance for the Group Three Prix Maurice de Nieuil over 2500 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse in July. He finished second of the ten runners, beaten half a length by the British-trained four-year-old Merce Cunningham, to whom he was conceding seven pounds. =1991/1992 National Hunt season= Before the start of the 1990 Flat season, Royal Gait was bought by Sheikh Mohammed and was sent to be trained by Henry Cecil at Newmarket. Due to training problem, the gelding missed the whole of the 1990 and 1991 flat seasons with a leg injury. As a seven-year-old, he was transferred to the stable of James Fanshawe to be prepared for National Hunt racing. After almost three and a half years off the course, Royal Gait returned in a novice hurdle race at Kempton Park on 26 December 1991. He was three years older than any of hi opponent and started at odds of 12/1 in a field of thirteen. Ridden by Graham McCourt, he hung badly to the left in the closing stages but finished second to the favourite, Travado, who went on to win several major races including the Arkle Challenge Trophy in 1993. The unplaced horses included the subsequent Fighting Fifth Hurdle winner Halkopous. Four weeks later, Royal Gait started the 2/9 favourite for a novice hurdle at Nottingham Racecourse and recorded his first win over obstacles, taking the lead approaching the last hurdle and accelerating clear to win by fifteen lengths from K-Brigade. At the same course on 15 February, Royal Gait was matched against more experienced hurdlers in a handicap race over two miles. Carrying a relatively light weight of 149 pounds, he started the 10/11 favourite and won \\"comfortably\\" by three and a half lengths from Cheerful Times. On 10 March 1992, Royal Gait was moved up sharply in class to contest the Grade I Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham. As a nine-year-old with only three previous runs under National Hunt rules, he was both the oldest and the least experienced horse in the sixteen runner field. Ridden by McCourt, he started the 6/1 third favourite behind the 1991 winner Morley Street and Granville Again, who went on to win the race in 1993. He was restrained in the early stages before moving up to take the lead approaching the final hurdle where he was challenged and headed by the David Elsworth-trained five-year-old Oh So Risky. In the closing stages, Royal Gait failed to keep a straight course, hanging to the left and then to the right, but he regained the lead and prevailed by half a length and a short head from Oh So Risky and Ruling. He was the first novice to win the race since Doorknocker in 1956. After a break of more than nine months, Royal Gait returned in a handicap hurdle at Leopardstown Racecourse on 30 December in which he was assigned top weight of 168 pounds. He started the 11/10 favourite but finished fourth of the seven runner behind the Noel Meade- trained Novello Allegro. Shortly after crossing the finishing line, Royal Gait collapsed and died after having a heart attack. McCourt said, \\"He began to lose his action three strides before the last. At first I thought he had blown up or even broken down, but as soon as we got to the line I realised he was going to keel over with me\\".

He was the first President of the Court of Accounts (1834‚Äì37, 1839‚Äì63) and became a Senator of the Second French Empire. Early years F√©lix Barthe was born in Narbonne, Aude, on 28 July 1795. His parents were Michel Barthe (1758-1820), deputy and counsel of the five hundred, and Marie-Anne Valette (1762-1830). He was educated at Saint-R√©my college in Toulouse, then studied at the faculty of Law, and began his career in Paris. He became affiliated with the Carbonari. On 8 August 1820 he married C√©lestine Victoire Thomas (1801-1875). They had one daughter. Barthe soon became known by the Liberal party when he spoke at the funeral of a young man named Lallemand who was killed by a royal guard in June 1820 while shouting \\"Long Live the Charter\\" during a riot in the Place de la Concorde. Barthe attacked the murderer before the council of war, who refused to listen, and sent a protest to the newspapers. The censors would not allow its publication. Barthe mostly pleaded in political trials. He obtained the acquittal of Lieutenant Colonel Augustin Joseph Caron in the Chamber of Peers. In Colmar he defended three of the accused in the Conspiracy of B√©fort, then in Paris defended the Four Sergeants of La Rochelle. He defended the Deputy for the Bas-Rhin, Jacques Koechlin, for his pamphlet on the Colmar plot. In this case in July 1823 Barthe was suspended for a month for the liveliness of his defense. He pleaded before the Chamber of Deputies for the Journal du Commerce, guilty of having discussed the elections too freely, which received a minimum sentence. July Monarchy Barthe took an active part in the July Revolution of 1830, in the protest of the journalists and the work of the Municipal Committee, and was then appointed prosecutor at the Civil Court of the Seine. On 21 October 1830 he was elected Deputy for the 7th arrondissement of Paris. Barthe entered the cabinet of Jacques Laffitte on 27 December 1830, replacing Joseph M√©rilhou at the Ministry of Public Education. In this post he ran successfully for reelection as Deputy in the 11th arrondissement of Paris on 10 February 1831. On 12 March 1831 he became Minister of Justice in the new cabinet of Casimir Perier. On 5 July 1831 he was reelected Deputy in the 11th arrondissement. Barthe made some changes to the penal law, of which a new version was promulgated on 28 April 1832. He remained Minister of Justice until 4 April 1834. Barthe's grave in the P√®re- Lachaise cemetery in Paris Barthe was named a peer of France and President of Court of Accounts. On 15 April 1837 he joined the cabinet of Louis Mathieu Mol√©, holding office until 31 March 1839. He then returned to the Presidency of the Court of Accounts. He was given the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor on 19 April 1846. Second Empire In 1848 Barthe was dismissed as first president of the Legion of Honor, but was restored in 1849. On 31 December 1852 he was appointed a Senator of the Second Empire. His former views were greatly moderated. He sometimes spoke in the house, in particular in an address on 6 March 1861 supporting the maintenance of Rome as the temporal seat of the Holy See, the basis of the independence of its spiritual authority.

Raine, on his own account, began painting portraits by candlelight in 1897. In 1901, a portrait of Francis Foljambe by Raine, and a self-portrait, were hanging at Osberton Hall. Raine was described in newspapers as \\"The cellar artist\\". Stories about his method of painting in the dark were printed. The techniques he employed in his underground studio off Hanover Square, Westminster were stated to be an effort to recreate the style and results of artists he admired, such as Titian, Rembrandt and Velazquez. Painting by candlelight, using only three colours on his pallet and using special black canvas, Raine was able to complete a portrait in five hours, meaning the sitter would only need to visit his studio on one occasion. A newspaper report of 1904 stated that he never exhibited, and had painted portraits of Henry Edwyn King- Tenison, 9th Earl of Kingston and Charles Innes-Ker.

The mutation has occurred in domestic cats over the last 20 years. DNA testing has been done by UC Davis to confirm that the cats do not carry the Sphynx/Devon Rex gene. The breed was developed in Vonore, Tennessee. \\"Lykoi\\" means 'wolves' in Greek. Characteristics Lykoi vary from completely covered in hair to partially hairless. Sometimes they may lose all of their hair resulting in them looking like a Sphynx but it grows back. Lykoi are genetically distinct from the Canadian Sphynx. The hair coat is unique in appearance in that it resembles the coat of an opossum when mostly coated. Standards call for a solid black roan coat, a wedge-shaped head, and a lithe body of solid weight without excessive bulk. Lykoi are said to be friendly and unchallenging in their behavior. They display a high level of affection for their owners. A unique characteristic of the cat breed is that the Lykoi sheds a lot when older, but regrows its hair later in life depending on the season. The missing coat of the Lykoi's face gives the breed a werewolf-like appearance.  History of the cat breed Two different sets of domestic shorthairs with the Lykoi gene were adopted from a rescue after being discovered in Virginia in 2010, by Patti Thomas, who co-founded and named the breed, and in 2011, a second pair were located in Tennessee, by Johnny Gobble.http://nextshark.com/theres-a-terrifying-breed-of-werewolf-cats- that-act-like-dogs-and-cost-up-to-2500/ The Lykoi went before The International Cat Association (TICA) registry in 2012 and was passed to \\"Registration Only\\" status by unanimous consent. The breed is now recognized as a Championship Breed and were able to begin competing against other Championship breeds from May 2017, with TICA. Work is currently being done to expand the breeding program. The Lykoi is a naturally occurring gene in the feral cat population. The Lykoi breed was founded in 2011 by Johnny Gobble, Brittney Gobble, and Patti Thomas when two unrelated litters of kittens were presented to the founders as unique cats. The Gobbles did careful health evaluations to ensure that the cat's unusual appearance was not caused by sickness or disease. To prove it was a gene, Johnny Gobble bred two of the unrelated cats to produce the first intentionally bred Lykoi. Since the mother to one litter was a black domestic, extensive outcrossing with shorthair black domestic cats began. With time, it was determined that the gene was recessive, and to continue to reduce genetic inbreeding, more outcrossing with the black domestic cats was done. There are still Lykoi cats born to the feral cat population, and sometimes they can be used in the breeding program. Once Championship status is reached, there should be enough outcrossing to ensure that inbreeding is minimal. Coat At the University of Tennessee, dermatologists examined them for any skin abnormalities. Along with biopsy samples of the skin, the dermatologists could find no reason for the coat pattern. What they did find is that some hair follicles lacked all the necessary components required to create hair (which is why Lykoi lack an undercoat). They also found that the follicles that were able to produce hair lacked the proper balance of these components to maintain the hair (which is why Lykoi do molt and can become almost completely bald from time to time). It was determined, with test breeding, to be true natural mutation. In popular culture Channel Zero: Dream Door, episode 3.

The story is set in Berlin in 1810 and 1811, and follows the German writer Heinrich von Kleist and his lover Henriette Vogel in the final stages of their lives. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. Plot In Berlin the affluent Henriette Vogel (Birte Schn√∂ink) holds a soiree where the poet Heinrich von Kleist attends. Heinrich approaches his close friend and cousin Marie (Sandra H√ºller) and after telling her how living has become painful to him he asks her to consider dying with him in a murder-suicide pact. Marie declines. Heinrich then approaches Henriette and tells her that as Marie has declined his dearest wish his love for her is dying as his love for Henriette begins to blossom. After telling Henriette that he feels she is an unloved outsider like him he asks her to join him in death. Henriette is appalled at his characterization of her as she feels she is close to both her husband and her daughter. She refuses his offer. Shortly after Henriette begins to suffer from spasms and fainting fits. Heinrich continues to visit with Henriette during her illness and finds her life mediocre and conventional as she will not even allow him to visit her alone in order not to raise gossip. He continues to hope that she will consent to die with him. For awhile Henriette's doctor cannot find the cause of her illness which he assures her is likely not serious. However after sending samples of her urine and her medical file away for a second opinion he learns that she has a fatal tumour that will kill her before long. After learning of the news Henriette calls Heinrich to her home where she allows him to be alone with her for the first time. She tells him she is dying and admits that now she feels alone and unloved just as he described her. She tells him that she would like to enter into the suicide pact with him. Heinrich receives the news rather coldly telling Henriette he hoped that he would meet someone who was willing to die because he wanted to die and not for her own reasons. Reluctantly Heinrich and Henriette head off into the country together hoping to complete their pact. However at the inn where they are staying Heinrich meets an acquaintance and the three are forced to have an awkward dinner together with Heinrich's friend believing they are lovers. The trip is a failure and the two return home. Heinrich then goes to visit his cousin Marie again who has returned from Paris newly engaged. Heinrich once again asks Marie to die with him and she refuses telling him that though life is stupid and pointless it is important to seek out the good. Having conclusively been rejected by Marie, Heinrich returns to Henriette and tells her he has been thinking of her constantly and asks her to renew their pact. She agrees. Meanwhile Henriette's husband, Vogel, returning from a trip to Paris tells Henriette that he showed her file to another doctor who believes she might not have a tumour after all. He asks her to accompany him to Paris where she can receive more advanced medical treatment. Noticing how close Henriette has become to Heinrich he also tells her that he would respect her choice if she decided to leave him for Heinrich. Henriette dismisses the idea calling Heinrich selfish. Heinrich arrives at the Vogel house in order to usher Henriette away so they can die together. Henriette is reluctant to go but Vogel insists that the exercise and fresh air will be good for her. They tell Heinrich that there is a possibility that Henriette will live as they are planning to go to Paris to see another doctor. Heinrich and Henriette go off together and stay the night at an inn where Heinrich reads a poem to Henriette and apologizes for ever doubting her. The next day they head off into the woods. Henriette begins to tell Heinrich that she had something to say the previous day but before she can finish her thought he shoots and kills her. Preparing to shoot himself in the head he fires twice only to have the gun not function both times. After learning of the death of his wife Vogel searches his desk for a letter and eventually finds the note that Henriette wrote to him before her first planned suicide attempt hidden in a drawer. Going into the woods he is able to see both Henriette and Heinrich's bodies still lying out in the open. Returning home Vogel learns from Henriette's physician that an autopsy revealed that Henriette was in good health with no tumour or ulcer. Vogel realizes that her symptoms were caused by love after all.

This list cover the periods from 1747 to 1826. This spans the emergence of denomination in the mid-18th century, the emigration of the Shakers to New York on the eve of the American Revolution, and subsequent missionary work and the establishment of nineteen major planned communities.

His followers await for his resurrection that he predicted, but this resurrection does not occur. 1779 * \\"New Light\\" congregations of Baptists and Presbyterians in Hancock, Massachusetts and Caanan and New Lebanon, New York, experience revivals which presage the Second Great Awakening. They hold daily meetings that include extraordinary spiritual phenomena, speaking in tongues, and visions.J.E.A. Smith, History of Pittsfield, vol. 1 (Boston: Lee and Shepard, 1869), 453.

The newfound popularity attracts the attention of the New York state government. * Because of the avowed pacifism and British origin of the Shakers at a time when the American colonies are at war for independence from Britain, New York arrests and imprisons Lee and several of her followers on suspicion of espionage. They are released later that year.Stein, The Shaker Experience in America pp. 13‚Äì14. 1781 through 1783 * Ann and William Lee and James Whittaker, along with some of their followers, travel on an extended missionary tour of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Upstate New York, gathering converts and establishing a network of followers throughout the Northeastern United States.

The center of operations for the missionary work is the late Ireland's \\"Square House\\" in Harvard, Massachusetts, where the Shakers attract a devoted following. 1783 * September 3: Effective end of the American Revolutionary War when the Treaty of Paris is signed. 1784 * After returning to Watervliet, William Lee dies on July 21, and Ann Lee dies on September 8.

The New York State Court of Appeals rules that the daughters, Phebe and Betty, are free to choose whether to stay with the Shakers or with Lane. They choose to remain at Watervliet. Prime and Hannah Lane then attempt to remove Betty by force, but fail to do so. * December 16: The first of the New Madrid earthquakes and its aftershock inflicts minimal damage to West Union. 1812 * January 23: The second of the New Madrid earthquakes. *February 7: The third of the New Madrid earthquakes. While the earthquakes themselves only slightly damage West Union, they induce flooding of the Wabash River on which the community is situated. The resulting wet floodplains and swamps ground breed malaria and other insect-born diseases. * The first written collection of Shaker hymns, Millennial Praises, is published. * The attempt to form a commune at New Canaan is abandoned. Enfield remains the only Shaker community in Connecticut. * June 18: the War of 1812 breaks out between the United States and the United Kingdom and their respective allies. * September 1812: the Shaker community at West Union, Indiana, in order to escape the turmoil of the war, is temporarily disbanded and its membership takes shelter in the Ohio and Kentucky villages. * A branch of the New Lebanon Shaker Village, consisting of two families, is established in Canaan, New York. 1814 * March 1814: Shakers start returning to West Union, Indiana. 1815 * Mary Dyer renounces the Shakers and attempts to regain custody of her children, whom she had signed over to the community. * February 7: The New York State Legislature takes up the case of Eunice Chapman, who seeks a divorce and custody of her children after her husband, James Chapman, joined the Shakers at Watervliet and secretly took their children into the community. * February 17: Ratification of the Treaty of Ghent, officially ending the War of 1812. 1816 * The first major Shaker writing, and their official biography of Ann Lee, Testimonies of the Life, Character, Revelations and Doctrines of our Ever Blessed Mother Ann Lee, is published. * February 16: After the failure of her previous petition, Chapman appeals to the New York legislature to grant her a legislative divorce rather than one obtained through the court. 1817 * February 20, 1817: In response to the controversy over Eunice Chapman and her children, the Ministry led by Lucy Wright issues an order to no longer take in a potential convert if they are married and their spouse does not wish to also join.Woo 2010, pp. 213-214 * A Shaker village is formed at Savoy, Massachusetts.Murray 1994, p. 95 The number of Shaker villages in Massachusetts (of which Maine is a part) now reaches its highest point, with eight communities. *A non-violent \\"Shaker slave revolt\\" occurs at South Union, Kentucky. Although the Shakers hold to equality and egalitarianism as an ideal, and numerous enslaved peoples were liberated once their legal owners joined South Union or other Shaker villages, many black members of South Union were still legally enslaved to Shakers who joined with them as their legal property and had yet to release them. 1818 * March 14: Eunice Chapman is finally granted relief from her marriage and given custody of her children. The law also grants a spouse of either gender whose partner has joined the Shakers the right to request custody of any underage children. The Shakers are also prohibited from transporting children across state lines.Blake 1960, pp. 371-372 * May 9: Chapman travels to Enfield Village in New Hampshire where her children are held by the Shakers.

It never fully recovered from the ravages of Tecumseh's War, the earthquake-induced floods and resulting fevers, and the War of 1812. It is the first major Shaker community to permanently disband, and the only major community to do so before 1875. Its closure also marks the end of any significant Shaker presence in the state of Indiana. Circa 1830 * The program of manumission of enslaved persons at South Union is completed. 1833 * September 10: Mary Partington, the last living and faithful member of the first band of nine English Shakers to arrive in America, dies. 1836 * The Sodus Bay Shaker community, dismayed at a proposal by New York State to build a canal near the village, is dissolved and relocated to Groveland, New York.

Background  Hunt Ball after the Betfair Ascot Chase (February 2014) Hunt Ball after the Ryanair Chase at Cheltenham Festival (March 2014) Between November 2011 and March 2012, Hunt Ball, trained by Keiran Burke, shot to fame with a significant rise through the handicap ranks and a weight increase in excess of 80lbs. He won seven races and climbed from a mark of 69 to 154, culminating in victory in the Pulteney Land Investments Novices‚Äô Handicap Chase at the Cheltenham Festival, which cemented his popularity amongst racing fans. He was sent off the 13/2 favourite and raced prominently under his regular rider Nick Scholfield. He was pulled out of the pack and led the field just after 2 out before storming clear to win. Hunt Ball went on to win Taunton‚Äôs richest-ever prize on 4 April 2013 after finishing second in the Grade 2 Peterborough Chase and third in the Grade 2 Argento Chase. Hunt Ball won a total of 8 races while in training with Kieran Burke, but his then-owner Anthony Knott agreed to a private sale of the horse to Atlantic Equine, an American-based syndicate run by Nick Carter and business partner Stephen Price. Hunt Ball left the UK for the US on 24 May 2013, where he joined the stable of Jonathan E. Sheppard. After four unsuccessful attempts over American obstacles and with a final run in the Breeders' Cup Grand National Steeplechase at Far Hills, it was decided that Hunt Ball would return to England and join the yard of three-time British jump racing Champion Trainer Nicky Henderson while still racing for Atlantic Equine. Hunt Ball's first run back in the UK yielded a 3rd place in the Grade 1 Betfair Ascot Chase in February 2014 followed by a 4th in the Grade 1 Ryanair Chase at the Cheltenham Festival. His penultimate run for the 2013/2014 season was in the Crabbies Grand National where he finished 17th, having raced well for much of the 4m 3f. Hunt Ball chased the leaders until 3 fences out only to tire over the marathon trip. He finished the season at Sandown, finishing 3rd in the Bet365 Oaksey Chase.

It aired on Fox in the United States on March 16, 2014. Plot Tina does not make the cut on the guestlist for Tammy's Bat Mitzvah, but gets to attend as part of the catering staff when Bob and the family are hired for the event, where she is still excited about the prospect of scoping out the boys from other schools who will be there. When Louise convinces the party coordinator, Janet, to quit, Tammy enlists Tina to fill in as her coordinator. Tina helps an ungrateful Tammy follow the schedule and navigate her various family members. Meanwhile, the rest of the Belchers attempt to stay at their catering post, but are gradually each seduced away by the variety of other foods being offered. Bob and Linda in particular become so caught up that they find themselves at a wedding reception in the same venue. While inspecting a faulty light in the interior of a large, hollow, light-up replica of Tammy's head, Tammy catches Louise in the act of trying to pour guacamole out the nose of the replica head, causing Louise to accidentally drop the headset in the bowl of guacamole, and both Tammy and Louise become trapped inside when the head is hoisted above the stage. After unclogging the headset, in a fit of rage, Louise secretly turns her headset off in response to Tammy's nasty attitude, pretending they're still clogged, leaving them unable to communicate with Tina or anyone else to let them know where they are. Following Tammy's previous order to keep the party moving no matter what, Tina takes Tammy's place in the Bat Mitzvah activities, receiving congratulations from Tammy's family and friends (who begin calling her \\"other Tammy\\"), reading from the Torah, and leading the dances. Tammy becomes dismayed when she realizes that her nasty behavior and attitude has resulted in her family and friends not noticing or caring that she is missing. Louise helps her realize that she's been a \\"terrible Bat- zilla\\" and eventually reveals the headset is unclogged, but demands that Tammy invite Tina to all her future parties. Tammy agrees, but when the girls contact Tina, she ignores them in order to stay in the spotlight. Tammy and Louise manage to break through the bottom of the replica just as Tina leads the ladies' choice dance with the most popular boy at the party. Tina apologizes to Tammy, but tells her that she now understands why she acted so obnoxious: being the center of attention is intoxicating. Tammy is momentarily pleased that someone else understands her, but is incensed again when Tina thanks her for coming to her Bat Mitzvah. Before Tammy can attack her, Tina calls everyone to dance the Hora and the party goers lift a furious Tammy into the air. The Belchers meet up and exit the party as Tina wishes Tammy a happy Bat Mitzvah. Reception Pilot Viruet of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A-, saying \\"It‚Äôs one of those episodes where the events, while funny, pale in comparison to the wonderful little character moments: Louise showing how much she cares about her sister but not going totally soft (she is mostly indifferent to Tammy‚Äôs upset cries); Tina understanding her selfish and obsessive actions; the entire family continuing to accept whatever silly traits the rest of them have.\\" Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode an 8.6 out of 10, saying \\"There‚Äôs much to love about the Belcher children on Bob‚Äôs Burgers. Heck, they are 2/3rds of the reason many people I know keep tuning in every week. But what really strikes me in episodes like tonight‚Äôs is how indefatigable they are. All three may be social pariahs with weird habits and attitudes, but they never let their lack of friends or good fortune get them down for very long.\\" The episode received a 1.1 rating and was watched by a total of 2.44 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, losing to American Dad!, The Simpsons, and Family Guy with 4.62 million. \\"Mazel-Tina\\" was submitted for consideration for the Outstanding Animated Program at the 66th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, and was one of the five nominees.

Although all the members of the group had taken part in other music bands, they started singing and playing songs belonging to famous groups like Rancid, Blink 182, No use for a name, Bouncing souls etc. They thought that it could be a good idea to mix the two different voices, because at that moment that mixture was not very usual. Then, Amets entered the band. After a few weeks, with the aim of giving more strength to Hesian, a new guitar player was added, Erik. The first music band was completed. That summer, they recorded they first song called \\"Maite dugu\\". At the end of the year they recorded the song \\"Euskal Herriak autodeterminazioa\\". From the release of that song, they decided to include some air instruments in the group, so Eneko (trumpet), Igotxo (saxophone) and Buton (trombone) got into the music band. As time went by, their role in the group increased until they became an essential part in it . In June 2007 they recorded they first album known as \\"Maite dugu\\" in the K studios of Pamplona. 2007-2010 Before they published their first album, they gave ten concerts in Sakana. From then, to 2009, the number of concerts increased to 115. Although most of the concerts had been given in the Basque Country, they also played in Catalonia and Spain. In October they published their second album \\"Herriaren oihua\\". After a little rest in 2009 and with new members in the band, Karlos with the trombone, Mireia the voice and Xabi with the guitar they recorded their third album in 2010 called \\"Borrokatu eta irabazi\\". The title reflects the difficulties they had suffered until they reached their aim, that is, become one of the most popular groups in the Basque Country. Nevertheless, they had to make some changes in the group, so as a consequence, they stopped giving concerts for a while. After publishing three albums in four years and giving 150 concerts it was time to take a breath. 2011-Nowadays In September they decided to continue with the group. Zuri√±e and Txamus replaced Mireia and Karlos and they started to work hard. In August they published their fourth album known as \\"Hitzetik\\". After that, they recorded another album called \\"Hemen eta orain\\" .

While at Boston, Lincolnshire, he for some years worked as a printer and publisher. In 1811‚Äì12 he, in conjunction with Pishey Thompson, ran The Enquirer, or Literary, Mathematical, and Philosophical Repository, Boston. At other times Marrat was a teacher of mathematics, in Lincolnshire and elsewhere. He lived in New York City from 1817 to 1820, and edited there The Scientific Journal (imprint \\"Perth Amboy, N.

From 1833 to 1836 Marrat was mathematical tutor in a school at Exeter, but on the death of his wife he returned to Liverpool. He died suddenly there on 26 March 1852, and was buried at the necropolis near that city.

Strictly speaking, only single-beam based configuration can be called acoustical tweezers (like their optical counterpart: optical tweezers as first called by Arthur Ashkin). Generally speaking, the broad concept of acoustical tweezers involves two configurations of beams: single beam and standing waves. The technology works by controlling the position of acoustic pressure nodesGorkov, L. P.; Soviet Physics- Doklady, 1962, 6(9), 773-775. that draw objects to specific locations of a standing acoustic field. The target object must be considerably smaller than the wavelength of sound used, and the technology is typically used to manipulate microscopic particles. Acoustic waves have been proven safe for biological objects, making them ideal for biomedical applications. Recently, applications for acoustic tweezers have been found in manipulating sub-millimetre objects, such as flow cytometry, cell separation, cell trapping, single-cell manipulation, and nanomaterial manipulation. The use of one-dimensional standing waves to manipulate small particles was first reported in the 1982 research article \\"Ultrasonic Inspection of Fiber Suspensions\\". Method In a standing acoustic field, objects experience an acoustic-radiation force that moves them to specific regions of the field. Depending on an object's properties, such as density and compressibility, it can be induced to move to either acoustic pressure nodes (minimum pressure regions) or pressure antinodes (maximum pressure regions). As a result, by controlling the position of these nodes, the precise movement of objects using sound waves is feasible. Acoustic tweezers do not require expensive equipment or complex experimental setups. Fundamental theory Particles in an acoustic field can be moved by forces originating from the interaction among the acoustic waves, fluid, and particles. These forces (including acoustic radiation force, secondary field force between particles, and Stokes drag force) create the phenomena of acoustophoresis, which is the foundation of the acoustic tweezers technology. =Acoustic radiation force= When a particle is suspended in the field of a sound wave, an acoustic radiation force that has risen from the scattering of the acoustic waves is exerted on the particle. This was first modeled and analyzed for incompressible particles in an ideal fluid by Louis King in 1934. Yosioka and Kawasima calculated the acoustic radiation force on compressible particles in a plane wave field in 1955.Yosioka, K. and Kawasima, Y.; Acustica, 1955, 5(3), 167-173. Gorkov summarized the previous work and proposed equations to determine the average force acting on a particle in an arbitrary acoustical field when its size is much smaller than the wavelength of the sound. Recently, Bruus revisited the problem and gave detailed derivation for the acoustic radiation force. 1: acoustic radiation force on a small particle As shown in Figure 1, the acoustic radiation force on a small particle results from a non-uniform flux of momentum in the near-field region around the particle, \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{F^{rad}}}=- abla\\\\mathit{U}, which is caused by the incoming acoustic waves and the scattering on the surface of the particle when acoustic waves propagate through it. For a compressible spherical particle with a diameter much smaller than the wavelength of acoustic waves in an ideal fluid, the acoustic radiation force can be calculated by \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{F^{rad}}}=- abla\\\\mathit{U}, where \\\\mathit{U} is a given quantity, also called acoustic potential energy. The acoustic potential energy is expressed as: U = {V_0}({{\\\\overline {p_{in}^2} } \\\\over {2{\\\\rho _f}c_f^2}}{f_1} - {{3{\\\\rho _f}\\\\overline {v_{in}^2} } \\\\over 4}{f_2}) where * \\\\mathit{V_{\\\\mathit{0}}} is the particle volume, * \\\\mathit{p_{\\\\mathit{in}}} is the acoustic pressure, * \\\\mathit{v_{\\\\mathit{in}}} is the velocity of acoustic particles, * \\\\mathit{\\\\rho}_{\\\\mathit{f}} is the fluid mass density, * \\\\mathit{c_{\\\\mathit{f}}} is the speed of sound of the fluid, * \\\\overline { < * > } is the time-average term, {1 \\\\over T}\\\\int\\\\limits_0^T {(*)} dt The coefficients \\\\mathit{f_{\\\\mathit{1}}} and \\\\mathit{f_{\\\\mathit{2}}} can be calculated by {f_1} = 1 - {{{\\\\rho _f}c_f^2} \\\\over and {f_2} = {{2({\\\\rho _p} - {\\\\rho _f})} \\\\over {2{\\\\rho _p} + {\\\\rho _f}}} where * \\\\mathit{\\\\rho}_{\\\\mathit{p}} is the mass density of the particle, * \\\\mathit{c}_{\\\\mathit{p}} is the speed of sound of the particle. =Acoustic radiation force in standing waves= The standing waves can form a stable acoustic potential energy field, so they are able to create stable acoustic radiation force distribution, which is desirable for many acoustic tweezers applications. For one-dimension planar standing waves, the acoustic fields are given by: {A_{in}}(x,t) = { \\\\over \\\\sin (kx)\\\\sin (\\\\omega t), {p_{in}}(x,t) = {P_0}\\\\cos (kx)\\\\sin (\\\\omega t), \\\\textbf{v}_\\\\textbf{in}(x,t)=\\\\frac{-P_{0}}{\\\\rho_{f}c_{f}}\\\\sin(kx)\\\\cos(\\\\omega t))\\\\textbf{e}_{\\\\textbf{x}} , where * \\\\mathit{A_{\\\\mathit{in}}} is the displacement of acoustic particle, * \\\\mathit{P_{\\\\mathit{0}}} is the acoustic pressure amplitude, * \\\\mathit{\\\\omega} is the angular velocity, * \\\\mathit{k} is the wave number. With these fields, the time-average terms can be obtained. These are: \\\\overline {p_{in}^2} = {1 \\\\over 2}P_0^2{\\\\cos ^2}(kx), \\\\overline {v_{in}^2} = {{P_0^2} \\\\over {2\\\\rho _f^2c_f^2}}{\\\\sin ^2}(kx), Thus, the acoustic potential energy is: U = {V_0}{{P_0^2} \\\\over {4{\\\\rho _f}c_f^2}}[{\\\\cos ^2}(kx){f_1} - {3 \\\\over 2}{\\\\sin ^2}(kx){f_2}], Then, the acoustic radiation force is found by differentiation: {F_x}^{rad} = - {\\\\partial _x}U = {V_0}k{E_{ac}}\\\\sin (2kx)\\\\Phi , {E_{ac}} = {{P_0^2} \\\\over {4{\\\\rho _f}c_f^2}}, \\\\Phi = {f_1} + {3 \\\\over 2}{f_2} = {{5{\\\\rho _p} - 2{\\\\rho _f}} \\\\over {2{\\\\rho _p} + {\\\\rho _f}}} - is the acoustic energy density, and * \\\\Phi is acoustophoretic contrast factor. The term \\\\sin(\\\\mathit{2kx}) shows that the radiation force period is one-half of the pressure period. Also, the contrast factor can be positive or negative depending on the properties of particles and fluid. For positive value of \\\\Phi, the radiation force points from the pressure antinodes to the pressure nodes, as shown in Figure 2, and the particles will be pushed to the pressure nodes. =Secondary acoustic forces= When multiple particles in a suspension are exposed to a standing wave field, they will not only experience acoustic radiation force, but also secondary acoustic forces caused by waves scattered by other particles. The inter-particle forces are sometimes called Bjerknes forces. A simplified equation for the inter-particle forces of identical particles is:Weiser, M. A. H.; Apfel, R. E., and Neppiras, E. A.; Acustica, 1984, 56(2), 114-119. {F_B}(x) = 4\\\\pi {a^6}[{{{{({\\\\rho _p} - {\\\\rho _f})}^2}(3{{\\\\cos }^2}\\\\theta - 1)} \\\\over {6{\\\\rho _f}{d^4}}}{v_{in}}^2(x) - {{\\\\omega^2 {\\\\rho _f}} \\\\over {9{d^2}}}{({1 \\\\over - {1 \\\\over )^2}p_{in}^2(x)] where * \\\\mathit{a} is the radius of the particle, * \\\\mathit{d} is the distance between the particles, * \\\\mathit{\\\\theta} is the angle between the central line of the particles and the direction of propagation of the incident acoustic wave. The sign of the force represents its direction: a negative sign for an attractive force, and a positive sign for a repulsive force. The left side of the equation depends on the acoustic particle velocity amplitude \\\\mathit{v}_{\\\\mathit{in}}(\\\\mathit{x}) and the right side depends on the acoustic pressure amplitude \\\\mathit{p}_{\\\\mathit{in}}(\\\\mathit{x}). The velocity-dependent term is repulsive when particles are aligned with wave propagation (Œò=0¬∞), and negative when perpendicular to wave propagation (Œò=90¬∞). The pressure-dependent term is unaffected by the particle orientation and is always attractive. In the case of a positive contrast factor, the velocity-dependent term diminishes as particles are driven to the velocity node (pressure antinode), as in the case of air bubbles and lipid vesicles. In a similar way, the pressure-dependent term diminishes as particles are driven towards the pressure node (velocity antinode), as are most solid particles in aqueous solutions. The influence of the secondary forces is usually very weak, and only has an effect when the distance between particles is very small. It becomes important in aggregation and sedimentation applications, where particles are initially gathered in nodes by the acoustic radiation force. As interparticle distances become smaller the secondary forces assist in a further aggregation until the clusters become heavy enough for sedimentation to begin. =Acoustic streaming= Acoustic streaming is a steady flow generated by a nonlinear effect in an acoustic field. Depending on the mechanisms, the acoustic streaming can be categorized into two general types, Eckert streaming and Rayleigh streaming.Boluriann, S. and Morris, P. J.; Aeroacoustics, 2003, 2(3), 255-292. Eckert streaming is driven by a time- average momentum flux created when high-amplitude acoustic waves propagate and attenuate in fluid. Rayleigh streaming, also called \\"boundary driven streaming\\", is forced by a shear viscosity close to a solid boundary. Both of the driven mechanisms come from a time-average nonlinear effect. A perturbation approach is used to analyze the phenomenon of nonlinear acoustic streaming. The governing equations for this problem are mass conservation and Navier-Stokes equationsÔºö \\\\partial_{\\\\mathit{t}}\\\\mathit{\\\\rho}=- abla\\\\cdot (\\\\mathit{\\\\rho} \\\\textbf{v}), \\\\mathit{\\\\rho}[\\\\partial _{\\\\mathit{t}}\\\\textbf{v}+(\\\\textbf{v}\\\\cdot abla)\\\\textbf{v}]=- abla \\\\mathit{p}+\\\\mathit{\\\\mu} abla^{2}\\\\textbf{v}+\\\\mathit{\\\\beta} \\\\mathit{\\\\mu} abla( abla\\\\cdot \\\\textbf{v})) where * \\\\mathit{\\\\rho} is the density of fluid, * \\\\textbf{v} is the velocity of fluid particle, * \\\\mathit{p} is the pressure, * \\\\mathit{\\\\mu} is the dynamic viscosity of fluid, * \\\\mathit{\\\\beta} is the viscosity ratio. The perturbation series can be written as p = {p_0} + {p_1} + {p_2}, \\\\textbf{v}=\\\\textbf{0}+\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{1}}+\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{2}}, \\\\mathit{\\\\rho}=\\\\mathit{\\\\rho}_{0}+\\\\mathit{\\\\rho}_{1}+\\\\mathit{\\\\rho}_{2}, which are diminishing series with the higher-order terms much smaller than the lower- order ones. The liquid is quiescent and homogeneous at its zero-order state. Substituting the perturbation series into the mass conservation and Navier- Stokes equation and using the relation of {p_1} = c_f^2{\\\\rho _1}, the first- order equations can be obtained by collecting terms in first-order, \\\\partial_{\\\\mathit{t}}\\\\mathit{p}_{1}=-\\\\mathit{\\\\rho}_{0}\\\\mathit{c}_{\\\\mathit{f}}^{2} abla\\\\cdot\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{1}}, \\\\mathit{\\\\rho}_{0}\\\\partial _{\\\\mathit{t}}\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{1}}=- abla\\\\mathit{p}_{1}+\\\\mathit{\\\\mu} abla^{2}\\\\textbf{v}_\\\\textbf{1}+\\\\mathit{\\\\beta}\\\\mathit{\\\\mu} abla( abla\\\\cdot\\\\textbf{v}_\\\\textbf{1}). Similarly, the second-order equations can be found as well, \\\\partial _{\\\\mathit{t}}\\\\mathit{\\\\rho}_{2}=-\\\\mathit{\\\\rho}_{0} abla\\\\cdot\\\\textbf{v}_\\\\textbf{2}- abla\\\\cdot(\\\\mathit{\\\\rho}_{1}\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{1}}), \\\\mathit{\\\\rho}_{0}\\\\partial _{\\\\mathit{t}}\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{2}}=- abla \\\\mathit{p}_{2}+\\\\mathit{\\\\mu} abla^{2}\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{2}}+\\\\mathit{\\\\beta}\\\\mathit{\\\\mu} abla( abla\\\\cdot\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{2}})-\\\\mathit{\\\\rho}_{1}\\\\partial _{t}\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{1}}-\\\\mathit{\\\\rho}_{0}(\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{1}}\\\\cdot abla)\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{1}}. For the first-order equations, taking the time derivation of the Navier-Stokes equation and inserting the mass conservation, a combined equation can be found: {1 \\\\over {c_f^2}}\\\\partial _t^2{p_1} = [1 - {{(1 - \\\\beta )\\\\mu } \\\\over {\\\\partial _t}]{ abla ^2}{p_1}. This is an acoustic wave equation with viscous attenuation. Physically, \\\\mathit{p}_{1} and \\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{1}} can be interpreted as the acoustic pressure and the velocity of the acoustic particle. The second-order equations can be considered as governing equations used to describe the motion of fluid with mass source [- abla\\\\cdot(\\\\mathit{\\\\rho}_{1}\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{1}}))] and force source [-\\\\rho_{1}\\\\partial _{t}\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{1}}-\\\\rho_{0}(\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{1}}\\\\cdot abla)\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{1}}]. Generally, the acoustic streaming is a steady mean flow, where the response time scale is much smaller than the one of the acoustic vibration. The time- average term \\\\overline{\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{2}}} is normally used to present the acoustic streaming. By using \\\\overline{\\\\partial _{\\\\mathit{t}}\\\\mathit{\\\\rho}_{2} }=0, the time-average second-order equations can be obtained: \\\\mathit{\\\\rho}_{0} abla\\\\cdot\\\\overline{\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{2}}}=- abla\\\\cdot\\\\overline{(\\\\mathit{\\\\rho}_{1}\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{1}})}, \\\\mathit{\\\\mu} abla^{2}\\\\overline{\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{2}}}+\\\\mathit{\\\\beta}\\\\mathit{\\\\mu} abla( abla\\\\cdot\\\\overline{\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{2}}})-\\\\overline{ abla \\\\mathit{p}_{2}}=\\\\overline{\\\\mathit{\\\\rho}_{1}\\\\partial _{\\\\mathit{t}}\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{1}}}-\\\\mathit{\\\\rho}_{0}\\\\overline{(\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{1}}\\\\cdot abla)\\\\textbf{v}_{\\\\textbf{1}}}. Fig. 3: Cross-section of acoustic streaming around a solid cylindrical pillar In determining the acoustic streaming, the first-order equations are most important. Since Navier-Stokes equations can only be analytically solved for simple cases, numerical methods are typically used, with the finite element method (FEM) the most common technique. It can be employed to simulate the acoustic streaming phenomena. Figure 3 is one example of acoustic streaming around a solid circular pillar, which is calculated by FEM. As mentioned, acoustic streaming is driven by mass and force sources originating from the acoustic attenuation. However, these are not the only driven forces for acoustic streaming. The boundary vibration may also contribute, especially to \\"boundary driven streaming\\". For these cases, the boundary condition should also be processed by the perturbation approach and be imposed on the two order equations accordingly. =Particle motion= The motion of a suspended particle whose gravity is balanced by the buoyancy force in an acoustic field is determined by two forces: the acoustic radiation force and Stokes drag force. By applying Newton's law, the motion can be described as: \\\\mathit{m}\\\\frac{d\\\\textit{u}}{\\\\mathit{d t}}=\\\\textit{F}^{\\\\textit{rad}}+\\\\textit{F}^{\\\\textit{drag}}, \\\\textit{F}^{\\\\textit{drag}}=6\\\\pi \\\\mathit{a}\\\\mathit{\\\\mu}(\\\\textit{v}-\\\\textit{u}). where *\\\\textit{v} is the fluid velocity, *\\\\textit{u} is the velocity of particle. For applications in a static flow, the fluid velocity comes from the acoustic streaming. The magnitude of acoustic streaming depends on the power and frequency of the input and the properties of the fluid media. For typical acoustic-based microdevices, the operating frequency may be from the to the range. The vibration amplitude is in a range of 0.1 nm to 1 Œºm. Assuming the fluid used is water, the estimated magnitude of acoustic streaming is in the range of 1 Œºm/s to 1 mm/s. Thus, the acoustic streaming should be smaller than the main flow for most continuous flow applications. The drag force is mainly induced by the main flow in those applications. Applications =Cell separation= Cells with different densities and compression strengths can theoretically be separated with acoustic force. It has been suggested that acoustic tweezers could be used to separate lipid particles from red blood cells. This is a problem during cardiac surgery supported by a heart-lung machine, for which current technologies are insufficient. According to the proposal, acoustic force applied to blood plasma passing through a channel will cause red blood cells to gather in the pressure node in the center and the lipid particles to gather in antinodes at the sides (see Figure 4). At the end of the channel, the separated cells and particles exit through separate outlets. The acoustic method might also be used to separate particles of different sizes. According to the equation of primary acoustic radiation force, larger particles experience larger forces than smaller particles. Shi et al. reported using interdigital transducers (IDTs) to generate a standing surface acoustic wave (SSAW) field with pressure nodes in the middle of a microfluidic channel, separating microparticles with different diameters. When introducing a mixture of particles with different sizes from the edge of the channel, larger particles will migrate toward the middle more quickly and be collected at the center outlet. Smaller particles will not be able to migrate to the center outlet before they are collected from the side outlets. This experimental setup has also been used to separate blood components, bacteria, and hydrogel particles. =3D cell focusing= Fluorescence-activated cell sorters (FACS) can sort cells by focusing a fluid stream containing the cells, detecting fluorescence from individual cells, and separating the cells of interest from other cells. They have high throughput but are expensive to purchase and maintain, and are bulky with a complex configuration. They also affect cell physiology with high shear pressure, impact forces and electromagnetic forces, which may result in cellular and genetic damage. Acoustic forces are not dangerous to cells, and there has been progress integrating acoustic tweezers with optical/electrical modules for simultaneous cell analysis and sorting, in a smaller and less-expensive machine. Acoustic tweezers have been developed to achieve 3D focusing of cells/particles in microfluidics. A pair of interdigital transducers (IDTs) are deposited on a piezoelectric substrate, and a microfluidic channel is bonded with the substrate and positioned between the two IDTs. Microparticle solutions are infused into the microfluidic channel by a pressure-driven flow. Once an RF signal is applied to both IDTs, two series of surface acoustic waves (SAW) propagate in opposite directions toward the particle suspension solution inside the microchannel. The constructive interference of the two SAWs results in the formation of a SSAW. Leakage waves in the longitudinal mode are generated inside the channel, causing pressure fluctuations that act laterally on the particles. As a result, the suspended particles inside the channel will be forced toward either the pressure nodes or antinodes, depending on the density and compressibility of the particles and the medium. When the channel width covers only one pressure node (or antinode), the particles will be focused in that node. In addition to focusing in a horizontal direction, cells/particles can also be focused in the vertical direction. After SSAW is on, the randomly distributed particles are focused into a single file stream (Fig. 10c) in the vertical direction. By integrating a standing surface acoustic wave (SSAW)-based microdevice capable of 3D particle/cell focusing with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection system, acoustic tweezers are developed into a microflow cytometer for high-throughput single cell analysis. The tunability offered by chirped interdigital transducers renders it capable of precisely sorting cells into a number (e.g., five) of outlet channels in a single step. This is a major advantage over most existing sorting methods, which typically only sort cells into two outlet channels. =Noninvasive cell trapping and patterning= A glass reflector with etched fluidic channels is clamped to the PCB holding the transducer. Cells infused into the chip are trapped in the ultrasonic standing wave formed in the channel. The acoustic forces focus the cells into clusters in the center of the channel as illustrated in the inset. Since the trapping occurs close to the transducer surface, the actual trapping sites are given by the near-field pressure distribution as shown in the 3D image. Cells will be trapped in clusters around the local pressure minima creating different patterns depending on the number of cells trapped. The peaks in the graph correspond to the pressure minima. =Manipulation of single cell, particle, or organism= Fig. 6: Traces of single cell manipulation Manipulating single cells is important to many biological studies, such as in controlling the cellular microenvironment and isolating specific cells of interest. Acoustic tweezers have been demonstrated to manipulate each individual cell with micrometer-level resolution. Cells generally have a diameter of 10‚Äì20 Œºm. To meet the resolution requirements of manipulating single cells, short-wavelength acoustic waves should be employed. In this case, a surface acoustic wave (SAW) is preferred to a bulk acoustic wave (BAW), because it allows using shorter- wavelength acoustic waves (normally less than 200 Œºm). Ding et al. reported a SSAW microdevice that is able to manipulate single cells with prescribed paths. Figure 6 records a demonstration that the movement of single cells can be finely controlled with acoustic tweezers. The working principle of the device lies in the controlled movement of pressure nodes in an SSAW field. Ding et al. employed chirped interdigital transducers (IDTs) that are able to generate SSAWs with adjustable positions of pressure nodes by changing the input frequency. They also showed that the millimeter-sized microorganism C. elegan can be manipulated in the same manner. They also examined cell metabolism and proliferation after acoustic treatment, and found no significant differences compared to the control group, indicating the non- invasive nature of acoustic base manipulation. In addition to using chirped IDTs, phaseshift-based single particle/cell manipulation has also been reported. =Manipulation of single biomolecules= Sitters et al. have shown that acoustics can be used to manipulate single biomolecules such as DNA and proteins. This method, which the inventors call acoustic force spectroscopy, allows measuring the force response of single molecules. This is achieved by attaching small microspheres to the molecules at one side and attaching them to a surface at the other. By pushing the microspheres away from the surface with a standing acoustic wave the molecules are effectively stretched out. =Manipulation of organic nano-materials= Polymer-dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) displays can be switched from opaque to transparent using acoustic tweezers. A SAW-driven PDLC light shutter has been demonstrated by integrating a cured PDLC film and a pair of interdigital transducers (IDTs) onto a piezoelectric substrate. =Manipulation of inorganic nano-materials= Acoustic tweezers provide a simple approach for tuneable nanowire patterning. In this approach, SSAWs are generated by interdigital transducers, which induced a periodic alternating current (AC) electric field on the piezoelectric substrate and consequently patterned metallic nanowires in suspension. The patterns could be deposited onto the substrate after the liquid evaporated. By controlling the distribution of the SSAW field, metallic nanowires are assembled into different patterns including parallel and perpendicular arrays. The spacing of the nanowire arrays could be tuned by controlling the frequency of the surface acoustic waves. =Selective manipulation= While most acoustic tweezers are able to manipulate a large number of objects collectively, a complementary function is to be able to manipulate a single particle within a cluster without moving adjacent objects. To achieve this goal, the acoustic trap must be localized spacially. A first approach consists in using highly focused acoustic beams. Since many particles of interest are attracted to the nodes of an acoustic field and thus expelled from the focus point, some specific wave structures combining strong focalization but with a minimum of the pressure amplitude at the focal point (surrounded by a ring of intensity to create the trap) are required to trap this type of particle. These specific conditions are met by Bessel beams of topological order larger than zero, also called \\"acoustical vortices\\". With this kind of wave structures, the 2D and 3D selective manipulation of particles has been demonstrated with an array of transducers driven by programmable electronics. Fig. 7: 33 polystyrene microspheres arranged into a pattern using selective acoustic tweezers. Compact flat acoustic tweezers based on spiral-shaped interdigital transducers have been proposed as an alternative to this complex array of transducer. This type of device allows patterning dozens of microscopic particles on a microscope slide (see Figure 7). The selectivity was nevertheless limited since the acoustic vortex was only focused laterally and hence some spurious secondary rings of weaker could also trap particles. Greater selectivity has been achieved by generating spherically focused acoustical vortices with a flat holographic transducer, combining underlying physical principles of Fresnel lenses in optics, the specificity of Bessel beam topology, and the principles of wave synthesis with IDTs. These latter tweezers generate spherically focused acoustical vortices, and hold potential for 3D manipulation of particles. Fig. 8: 10 cells patterned with single beam selective acoustical tweezers to form the letter AT. The viable individual selection, manipulation and positioning of human cells in a standard microscopy environment has been demonstrated with such selective acoustical tweezers based on focused acoustical vortices generated by active holograms. Trapping forces of up to 200pN with less than 2 mW of acoustic power are reported without affecting cells viability. Alternatively, another approach to localize the acoustic energy relies on the use of nanosecond-scale pulsed fields to generate localized acoustic standing waves. = High frequency tweezers and holographic InterDigitated Transducers (IDTs) = Fig. 9: Holographic IDT designed to synthesize laterally (left) and 3D (right) focused acoustical vortices The individual selective manipulation of micro-objects requires to synthesize complex acoustic fields such as acoustic vortices (see previous section) at sufficiently high frequency to reach the necessary spatial resolution (typically the wavelength must be comparable to the size of the manipulated object to be selective). Many holographic methods have been developed to synthesize complex wavefields including transducer arrays, 3D printed holograms, metamaterials or diffraction gratings. Nevertheless all these methods are limited to relatively low frequencies with an insufficient resolution to address micrometric particles, cells or microorganisms individually. On the other hand, InterDigitated Transducers (IDTs) were known as a reliable technique to synthesize acoustic wavefields up to GHz frequency. Hence to address the resolution problem, it was proposed to combine the concept of IDTs and of holograms: With holographic IDTs, the wave is synthesized by materializing with metallic electrodes equiphase lines of the targeted wavefield at the surface of a piezoelectric substrate. The synthesis of laterally focused (cylindrical) and 3D focused (spherical) acoustical vortices has been demonstrated with this method. But the method is general and other complex wavefields could also be addressed. The main difference between the method used for the synthesis of 2D vortices and 3D vortices is that in the former, surface acoustic waves are synthesized, while in the second bulk waves are synthesized. For surface acoustic waves, the electrodes design depends on the wave speed in the (anisotropic) substrate leading to anistropic electrodes shape (see Fig.9, left). While for bulk waves, the electrodes design depends on wave speed in the (isotropic) glass support, leading to isotropic electrodes (see Fig. 10 right). The interest of these holographic IDTs resides in (i) their high working frequency allowing resolutions down to micrometric scales, (ii) their easy fabrication with standard lithography technics and (iii) their simple integration in a standard microscope since they are flat, transparent and miniaturized.

She helped to develop an explanation for the cause of gout and experimented with early drugs to treat the disease which are still in use today. Early life and education Yu was born in Shanghai, China in 1911. At age 13, her mother died and her father worked three jobs to help support her educational ambitions. As a sophomore at Ginling College in China, Yu was admitted into Peking Union Medical College on full scholarship and received her medical degree with highest honors in 1939. In the same year, Yu became the Chief Resident in Internal Medicine at Peking Union Medical College. Career and research While in China, Yu researched the various diseases found in citrus fruits and beans. Yu came to New York in 1947 and became a U.S. citizen in 1950. She taught at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons until joining the staff faculty at Mount Sinai Medical Center in 1957 where she would spend the rest of her career. In 1973, Yu became the first female to be appointed as a full professor at Mount Sinai Hospital, one of the oldest and largest teaching hospitals in The United States. = Causes of Gout = Yu conducted extensive research in which was continuously funded by the National Institutes of Health for 26 years. She began studying renal function in various diseases such as Wilson's disease before focusing her research on gout at Mount Sinai. Yu helped to establish an understanding of the metabolic relationship between elevated levels of uric acid and the pain experienced by gout patients. She aimed to classify and determine the differences the various forms of gout, such as acute gouty arthritis and chronic tophaceuous gout. Yu also studied the effect that other medication conditions have on the presentation of gout. She found that about half of the patients with gout have other associated medication conditions, including hypertension, proteinuria, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. = Treatment of Gout = Beginning in the 1950s, Yu developed medicines that have been proven to be successful for treating gout. In addition, Yu and her colleague Alexander B. Gutman helped to establish a groundbreaking clinic at Mount Sinai for the treatment of gout, one of the first gout clinics in the United States at Mount Sinai. Yu studied probenecid, a uricosuric drug which causes the removal of excess uric acid by being excreted with urine. She later conducted a five-year study that was published in 1961 in which she discovered colchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug that prevents recurring attacks of acute gout. In 1953, Yu conducted research on phenylbutazone as a treatment for various arthritic disorders, one being acute gouty arthritis. She and colleagues found that phenylbutazone injections lead to significantly higher urate clearance and more efficient excretion, making it successful in treating acute gout. In the 1960s, Yu further developed studies of gout‚Äôs mechanisms and soon discovered allopurinol, a drug that helps to prevent the formation of uric acid and is used in treating gout and kidney stones. In 1980, she studied carprofen and its effect on urinary excretion. She found it was effective for treating acute gouty arthritis and recommended further trials. While at Mount Sinai Hospital, Yu helped to establish one of the first systemized laboratory tests for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis. In 1972, Yu co-authored and published Gout and Uric Acid Metabolism and in 1982, she published the book called The Kidney in Gout and Hyperuricemia .  Awards and Honors  At age 81, Yu retired as the first female professor at Mount Sinai Hospital with professor Emeritus status in 1992. She was awarded the Distinguished Career Achievement Award from the Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was also awarded the Master Award from the American Association of Rheumatology for her work in diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis. In 2004, The Tsai-Fan Yu Foundation was established as a philanthropic nonprofit corporation. Over the course of her career, she worked with over 4000 gout patients at one of the largest gout-focused practices. She also published 220 scientific journal articles and is known for her ability to translate lab research into an effective treatment for patients. She is aunt to Hua Eleanor Yu, a professor in tumor immunotherapy and Humboldt Research Award recipient. Yu died at age 95 in March 2007 due to respiratory complications at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan.

Always niche, it was influential for its juxtaposition of unusual and vintage fabrics (often furnishing fabrics) and traditional tailoring. Describing the brand's signature at the time, Scott Crolla said: \\"My clothes are for someone who disregards fashion but enjoys fabrics‚Ä¶ I would call it a calculated disregard for conventional taste.\\" In the book London: After Fashion, Alistair O‚ÄôNeill described the look as: ‚Äúas odd a combination as Coward in Las Vegas, but it communicated a vision of Englishness just as brashly.\\" History The store‚Äôs opening in 1981 coincided with the arrival of the New Romantic music/cultural movement. Crolla's use of lavish fabrics and textures on waistcoats, ties, jackets and trousers, including chintz, paisley and velvet, attracted fans including Boy George, Princess Diana and Isabella Blow. It was also the antithesis of the austere palette and sculptural lines of Japanese brands gaining in popularity at the time, such as Yohji Yamamoto and Comme des Garcons. Initially, the company focused on menswear and, a year after the brand's launch, Ken Probst writing in The New York Times noted the renewed interest in British fashion created by the success of Brideshead Revisited and Chariots of Fire. Probst singled out Crolla as one of the most interesting of the new crop of men's fashion brands for its traditional cuts and unusual use of fabric, saying: \\"...its offerings include suits, jackets, shirts, pants, ties and even slippers ‚Äì all cut in traditional, conservative styles but made out of a rich and diverse collection of fabrics. The unexpected exuberance of the recolored plaids, the hand-woven Indian cottons embroidered with silk and the fabrics from the 1940s and 1950s contrasts with the unchanging designs of the British ‚Äòlook', resulting in an innovative fusion of opposing styles.\\" Womenswear was added to the collection in 1984, a year before the partnership between Scott Crolla and Georgina Godley was dissolved. After Crolla Godley moved on to design what she called \\"sport couture\\", using high-tech fabrics such as Gore-Tex and Lycra. Around this time, she also experimented with extreme padding of stomach and bottom for what she called her 'Lump and Bump' collection. This was a look that was later popularised by other designers, notably Comme des Gar√ßons. Godley acted as an advisor for Paul Smith and Missoni, later working with interiors retailer Habitat and as a lecturer at Central Saint Martins. Crolla won Bath Fashion Museum Dress of the Year in 1985 for a menswear outfit featuring a crushed shirt, velvet trousers and ikat mules. He designed for a short time for Callaghan. Later he moved into interior design with Lionel Bourcelot, launching a company called Ether. Early clients included Vivienne Tam. Legacy Crolla was among the fashion labels featured in the V&A;'s 2013 retrospective of 1980s fashion and culture From Club to Catwalk. Both Godley and Crolla have items of clothing in the museum's permanent collection. Crolla also featured among the earliest pieces in an exhibition about the life and wardrobe of Isabella Blow at Somerset House that ran from November 2013 ‚Äì March 2014.

Archaeological investigations indicate that Cherokee routinely used the area as a camp site during the colonial period. In 1794, a 200-acre parcel of land on both sides of the Reedy River, including the land occupied by the Conestee Mill and dam, was deeded to one Andrew Nelson. Grist mills and saw mills operated on the site as early as the 1790s. In 1800, Adam Carruth and Lemuel Alston purchased nearby land where Carruth manufactured muskets for the states of South Carolina and Georgia and briefly for the U.S. government; but the factory went bankrupt before 1824.Charlie Sowell, \\"Conestee Nature Park site is rich in history, mystery,\\" Greenville News, October 26, 2014, 6D. In 1799, Andrew Nelson sold the downstream 100 acres of his 200-acre parcel that included a ‚Äúmill seat and yard‚Äù on the south side of the river. By 1820, a small community had grown up around the mills. Before 1833, the existing mill buildings and machinery, were sold to Vardry McBee, the \\"Father of Greenville.\\" As \\"McBee Factory,\\" its mills produced both paper and woolen and cotton textiles. There were about fifty employees of the cotton factory, paper mill, gristmill, and sawmill, supporting a community of about 150 people. After 1875, the mill was known as the Reedy River Factory until being rechartered as Conestee Mills in 1909. In the 1890s the existing mill building was constructed; and about 1892, the rock dam was raised to its present height, creating a lake of . In the twentieth century the City of Greenville and twelve mills and mill villages upstream from Conestee discharged their sewage and industrial wastes into the Reedy River and therefore into Conestee Lake. The pollutants produced foul odors and so depleted the oxygen content of the lake that it became unfit for any use other than generating power. In 1925, Conestee Mills sued the City of Greenville for damages, and although the mill eventually failed because of the protracted litigation and the Great Depression, a South Carolina Supreme Court decision of 1931 \\"was an early landmark in the fight to clean South Carolina's rivers.\\"Lake Conestee Nature Park website. The mill closed in 1939, reopened under new ownership in 1946, then closed for a final time in 1971.

Nathanial Cary, \\"Dam poses disaster rick, owner says,\\" Greenville News, February 5, 2017, 4A.

In 2000 the Conestee Foundation, a 501(c)(3) conservation organization, was formed to lead the revitalization of the lake as a wetlands through the development of the nature park; and the foundation used settlement funds from a June 1996 Colonial Pipeline spill to purchase the lake and the dam. Once safety studies of the brownfield were complete, it was determined that no harm would result if the toxic sediment and dam were left in place,; Cary, 4A. The toxic wastes include heavy metals (such as lead), pesticides, and cancer-causing chemical compounds such as PCBs and PAHs. though in December 2016, inspectors from the state Department of Health and Environmental Control determined Conestee Dam, which is not keyed into the bedrock, to be in poor condition due to deterioration of mortar and water seepage.Cary, 1A.

Over the two years she was at Georgetown University Hospital, she was only assigned seven cases. Believing that discrimination against her gender was affecting her training, Anderson left the hospital and began working in various community hospitals. In these hospitals, she worked on 700 cases in the first year. In 1973, she gained American citizenship. Career Anderson has had multiple academic appointments over the course of her career.

He is portrayed by Juan Pablo Di Pace. Brief Character History Born in Mexico, Joaquin Reyes was a childhood friend of Elena Ramos and her brother, Drew. Elena convinced her parents to take in homeless Joaquin, and he lived with the Ramos family until they left for Dallas, Texas. After Elena's family moved to Dallas, he left his local Catholic school in Mexico and joined a street gang. The leader, Ernest Mendez- Ochoa, saw Joaquin had skills with numbers and mathematics and sent him to school in Europe. Upon his return, he took the name Nicolas Trevino and the street gang had grown into the Mendez-Ochoa Cartel. He invested in a deal that lost the Cartel $600 million and the Cartel threatened his wife, Lucia, and sons until the money was repaid. Nicolas went to the Cartel leader saying he wanted out of the Cartel. The leader agreed to let Nicolas go once Nicolas delivered enough money for the Cartel to buy the next Mexican presidential election and thus control the Mexican government. Nicolas arrives in Dallas presumably to act as Cliff Barnes's proxy for his 1/3 of Ewing Global. Nicolas secretly agrees to help Elena get revenge on the Ewings for J.R. stealing her father's land. Elena secures a job with Ewing Global only to be acting as a mole planted by Cliff and Nicolas. Christopher Ewing invites Nicolas to the Ewing barbecue in an effort to raise capital for the arctic leases then goes to Mexico to investigate Nicolas' background when details about his alleged deal with Cliff Barnes don't ring true. Nicolas attempts to bribe a witness in the Cliff Barnes murder case, but he is met by Bobby when he drops off the bribe money. In Mexico, Christopher meets a man who was cheated out of his share of the profits from a drug patent by Nicolas. He is then taken to the Trevino family compound where he is introduced to Nicolas' wife, Lucia, and their sons. A guilt-ridden Drew is in hiding at the Trevino compound in Mexico. Nicolas and Elena start an affair. Lucia travels to Dallas and confronts Nicolas about his relationship with Elena and blackmails him over his threat to divorce her. Elena and Nicolas attempt to divide Pamela and John Ross in a new deal Ewing Global is in to purchase oil leases in the Alaskan Arctic. Nicolas, after telling Elena he wouldn't, sends Pamela a video of John Ross having sex with Emma. Drew returns to Dallas, which leads to a beating from Christopher. Drew remains in hiding but threatens to the ruin of Nicolas and Elena's plans to get his newfound revenge on the Ewings, which causes Nicolas to contact the Mendez-Ochoa Cartel in order to stop Drew. Drew is captured by the Mendez-Ochoa Cartel. It's revealed Drew started the fire at Southfork but news arrives that Sue Ellen has taken responsibility for starting the fire. Drew learns that Nicolas has been using Elena to repay his debt to the Cartel and confronts Nicolas. Nicolas agrees when the Cartel kills Drew and disguises it as a suicide. Luis and Nicolas dispose of Drew's body on the oil field where his father died years ago. The detective and fire investigator later concluded that Drew committed suicide where he was the prime suspect of setting the fire. The fire investigator reveals Drew committed arson where he sprayed rocket fuel on a window curtain and used an IED to set the fire in the guise of a plug-in an air freshener. Elena and her mother confront the Ewings with the proof for J.R. stealing the oil-rich land that belonged to Elena's father. Nicolas‚Äô plan to take over Ewing Global in the upcoming IPO for the Cartel moves forward. John Ross learns from Bum that Nicolas sent Pamela the video of John Ross and Emma having sex. In front of Elena, John Ross reveals to Nicolas that Elena only obtained J.R.'s letter because she had sex with John Ross. As Ewing Global goes public, the man in charge of the IPO, Calvin Hannah is removed from the IPO at the last minute and replaced with Nicolas' man. Hunter McKay buys all of the shares with money from the Mendez-Ochoa cartel on orders of Nicolas but Hunter is killed shortly afterward and Nicolas takes his shares in Ewing Global. It's revealed that Cliff gave Nicolas 3% of Ewing Global and combined with the 48% they acquired gives them control of Ewing Global. Christopher meets with Nicolas' wife Lucia and informs her that Nicolas and Elena are having an affair. She tells Nicolas that Christopher knows his real identity and his debt to the Cartel. It is revealed that Lucia hired the photographer to spy on Nicolas and Elena. Later after Lucia learns of Nicolas' affair with Elena, she again meets Christopher and agrees to help him find Nicolas. Nicolas confesses to Elena the truth about his past and that he used her to pay off his debt. Elena is angry that Nicolas used her but he warns her that until the Cartel has enough money to buy the next Mexican presidential election Nicolas, Elena, Lucia, and his sons are all in danger.

It was the first mixed youth choir in Western Europe.Den Haan en Kann, p. 7-8 (preamble conductor and composer Ton Koopman), 36-37, 81-86.  Establishment of the choir  The building of the orphanage on the Hooglandsekerkgracht in the 18th century.1796, the second year of the Batavian Republic in the Netherlands, saw the start of a remarkable project at the orphanage. The aim of the project was to provide the children of the orphanage with musical education. A choir was to be formed expressly for orphans from the age of 15, boys and girls. The repertoire was to consist of songs of a religious nature though not exclusively Psalms as would normally be the case. Though it is not clear who was responsible for the establishment of the choir, we do know the name of the singing master in the trial period: J.H.T. Duville. This resident of Leiden was a private music teacher, either from the Southern Netherlands (the present Belgium) or France. He began teaching in January 1796. It is most likely that the establishment of the choir can be linked to the presence from 1795 of the French in the Netherlands. The orphanage‚Äôs board of trustees that founded the choir was very much in favour of the French and the ideals of the French Revolution. The progress made in the first few months was so much to the satisfaction of the trustees, that they decided to establish the choir (the ‚ÄòZangcollege‚Äô or ‚ÄòZanginstituut‚Äô) officially on 19 April 1796.Ibid., p. 9, 34-37, 55-56; RAL, archives HGW, inv.nrs. 4044‚Äì4050.  Music director  Duville was called away, shortly after the official start of the choir, leaving them in need of a replacement. But fortunately one was soon found: organist and composer Christian Friedrich Ruppe (1753-1826). At that time he was director of music at the Leiden University and organist at the Lutheran church in Leiden. He accepted the position and commenced his duties in July 1796.Ibid., p. 56-57.  Concerts and recession  From the time of his arrival the choir was funded by donations and the proceeds of concerts in which it participated. In the course of its existence four concerts were given in the Hooglandse Kerk, one of the two largest reformed churches in Leiden. Ruppe wrote works especially for the occasions, as well as songs written for the education and enjoyment of the children themselves. The first concert was given on the day following Christmas 1796. From the end of 1797 the choir faced a period of decline, mainly due to the worsening economic situation of the Batavian Republic as a whole and of the institution in particular. In spite of this, the quality and quantity of music written for the choir remained constant. The last concert took place on 27 December 1798. The dissolution of the choir came soon after, in August 1799. The books were closed on 12 January 1802.Ibid., p. 33, 68-76, 79-80.  European significance  Uniforms of a boy and girl of the Leiden Heilige Geest Orphanage on a column with the orphanage symbol, 18th century.Despite its short existence, the orphan choir displayed a number of remarkable aspects, some of which can even be called unique: The choir can be considered as the first mixed youth choir in Western Europe. It is also the first instance in the Netherlands of music education being given to children of a lower social class, and in a form that offered a variety of educational experiences; the children were taught to sing in a choir that performed in public and used texts of a religious nature. The trustees also saw participation in the choir as partly a recreational activity, which was quite a remarkable idea in view of the rather austere circumstances of parentless children in Dutch society. The select group of children participating in the choir could also be held up as an example to the rest of the children of the orphanage; those who did not sing in the choir were present at the concerts. The music written for them by Ruppe is an excellent example of Dutch religious music in the Classical Style.Ibid., p. 7-8, 36-37, 81-86.  Resident composer  Settings of works by well known poets from around Leiden were included in the orphan choir‚Äôs repertoire. Probably the best known of these poets is Hieronymus van Alphen (1746-1803) who by this time had written his famous poems for children, some of which were set by Ruppe and in the years 1822-1830 published. It is of course very rare for such a choir to have a director who is also its own resident composer. Of the music that Christian Friedrich Ruppe wrote for the choir, only two pieces written for performances have survived: the ‚ÄòKerstmuziek 1796‚Äô (‚ÄòMusic for Christmas 1796‚Äô) and the ‚ÄòMuziek voor het Paaschfeest 1797‚Äô (‚ÄòMusic for Easter 1797‚Äô). The manuscript of the ‚ÄòKerstmuziek 1796‚Äô was discovered in 1987 when a new inventory was made of the archives of the Heilige Geest Orphanage. The pieces can be seen in the light of the vocal music from the time of the ‚Äògodsdienstige zanggenootschappen‚Äô, so called religious choral societies, which existed in the Netherlands in the years (1790) 1800-1820.Ibid., p. 9, 56-62, 77-78; RAL, archives HGW, inv.nr. 4051 (‚ÄòMusic for Christmas 1796‚Äô), inv.nr. 4053 (‚ÄòMusic for Easter 1797‚Äô), inv.nr. 4054 (text booklets concerts Easter and Christmas 1797 and 1798).  Religious choral societies 1790-1820  The music manuscripts of the works made for the choral societies of The Hague, Rotterdam, Middelburg and other towns in the Netherlands are believed to be lost. The existing evidence consists of printed pamphlets with the text of the cantatas and newspaper announcements. They rarely contain any evidence of the music, but give some idea of the form and sometimes the scale of the pieces performed. The manuscripts of the Christmas and Easter music for the Leiden orphan choir are among the few documents preserved from the above-mentioned period that give evidence of this national phenomenon. These choral societies performed cantatas and other varieties of vocal music in the Dutch language. A number of these choirs were established to aid the introduction in 1807 of the new \\"Evangelische Gezangen\\", a supplement to the Psalms. Others however had a much more ambitious agenda. These choirs performed, often with orchestral accompaniment on the main Christian holy days. However, the events were not liturgical and open to the general public. Tickets were sold, the proceeds often going to charity. There is evidence that a lecture or sermon was given in combination with the musical performance in many cases. The public activities of the Leiden orphan choir also fit this description. Manuscript of the opening chorus of the Christmas Cantata by Christian Friedrich Ruppe, for the orphan choir debut in December 1796.Though there is evidence of activity of religious choral societies before 1800, the bulk seems to have occurred from 1800 to 1820. This coincides with an important political development; 1798 saw the ratification (imposed by the French) of a new constitution. One of the most important provisions of this new constitution was the effective separation of church and state. As a consequence, the Dutch reformed church was no longer entirely supported by the state, leaving the churches in the Republic to devise other means of gathering funds for their activities, largely those in support of the poor. A special committee was established particularly for this purpose in 1798. Given the charitable character of the ‚Äòzanggenootschap‚Äô concerts it is very likely that this was one of the ways the church attempted to accrue additional funds. The organizers of these societies were largely members of the clergy or associated with it. That they chose this way of generating funds is quite remarkable given the period with its turmoil and social and economic unrest. It also presupposes a broad interest in religious music of a rather modern nature which given the dominance of the Psalms in the church music in the Netherlands is equally remarkable.Ibid., p. 22-24, Kann, p. 9-11, 18.  Debut  The first concert, given on 27 December 1796, described as Third Christmas Day was a resounding success despite the cold. About a thousand souls attended the concert including the other children of the orphanage. Before and after the Christmas Cantata (Ruppe had composed adjuncting parts) the former Middelburg pastor Johannes Hendricus van der Palm (1763-1840) had given an instructive sermon. In his sermon, this new Leiden Professor had rhetorically asked those attending if Jesus himself would approve less of hearing music sung by the needy (the ‚Äòbehoeftigen‚Äô). Instrumentalists from the Leiden university, the refugee stadtholder William V and the Leiden bourgeoisie had supported the singers. In the Hooglandse Kerk, the immense church building in the immediate vicinity of the orphanage, the singing orphans together with the sound of horns, trumpets, violins and kettledrums chosen by composer Christian Ruppe must have surely made a lasting impression. An extensive and enthusiastic review in the Leydse Courant bears witness to this.Ibid., p. 9, 56-62, 77-78; RAL, archives HGW, inv.nr. 4052, Leydse Courant, 2-1-1797, p. 2.

Although some recordings of her works exist, Sonami generally eschews releasing recorded work.Rodgers, Tara. (2010). Pink Noises: Women on Electronic Music and Sound, Duke University Press Books, . pp. 8, 9-10, 54, 202 Biography Born in France in 1957, Laetitia Sonami began pursuing her interest in electronic music in the mid-1970s and studied with composers √âliane Radigue (France) and Joel Chadabe (US). She moved to California in 1978 where she studied composition at Mills College in Oakland with Robert Ashley, David Behrman, and Terry Riley.Gann, Kyle American Music in the Twentieth Century (Schirmer Books, 1997) , p. 382 She received an MFA from the Mills College Center for Contemporary Music in 1980. In 1991, she began developing a controller for performance that would become the ‚Äò‚ÄôLady‚Äôs Glove‚Äô‚Äô for which she is widely known in the experimental music world. Sonami has since abandoned performing with the glove controller, citing that \\"it had been for so many years unclear how I would think of music outside of the Glove.\\" She has built other instruments including the Bellowtron, an infrared sensor-based instrument mounted on a large bellow, one Sonami has prized for its \\"inefficiency.\\", and the Spring Spyre, which is dedicated to the applications of machine learning. Since the 1990s, Sonami has given performances and shown installation work in concert venues, museums, and art galleries internationally, including appearances at Ars Electronica (Linz, Austria), the Other Minds Festival (San Francisco), the Interlink Festival (Japan), Lincoln Center Out of Doors (New York), and Internationales Musikerinnen-Festival (Berlin). Sonami received a 2000 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award. In 2013, a film about Sonami, ‚Äò‚Äòthe ear goes to the sound: The Work of Laetitia Sonami‚Äô‚Äô, was made by artist Renetta Sitoy. Sonami was sound designer for ¬®A Blank Slate,¬® a 2014 film by Sara Eliassen. Sonami teaches sound art at the San Francisco Art Institute. The Lady‚Äôs Glove Worn on her right hand, Sonami‚Äôs instrument ‚ÄúThe Lady‚Äôs Glove‚Äù consists of a black, mesh, evening glove fitted with variety of sensors including micro-switches, transducers, pressure pads, resistive strips, ultrasonic receivers, light sensors, accelerometers, and a miniature microphone. These sensors measure various aspects of hand motion, speed, and proximity, allowing Sonami to send data to her computer to play and manipulate sound and light. The signals from the glove are routed through the Sensorlab, a piece of hardware developed at STEIM in Amsterdam, and are mapped onto MAX MSP software running on Sonami‚Äôs laptop computer, where her sounds are stored. She created the first one in 1991 for the Ars Electronica festival in Linz, Austria and since then has developed four updated versions. According to Sonami, the glove was originally conceived as a joke, a form of social commentary on technology, but evolved to become an instrument. Speaking about her definition of an instrument in the context of The Lady's Glove, she said: Collaboration Sonami‚Äôs works frequently include texts by novelist Melody Sumner-Carnahan. She also has a body of work described as ¬®live film,¬® developed in collaboration with video artist SUE-C (Sue Costabile), where the two artists manipulate photographs, handmade motor-driven collages, models, still lifes, remote control train-mounted cameras and assorted lighting and sound effects in real time while computers process the images and deliver them to the audio-visual system with custom software developed in Max/MSP/Jitter. Examples of such work include ¬®I.C You¬® (2006), a cinematic thriller based on a script by poet Tom Sleigh ¬®about an ice delivery man whose job is to keep America cold,¬® and ¬®Sheepwoman,¬® (2009) a live film inspired by Haruki Murakami's novels \\"A Wild Sheep Chase\\" and \\"Dance, Dance, Dance.\\" She has also made collaborative works with sound artist Paul DeMarinis, electronic music composer David Wessel, and choreographer Molissa Fenley. In 2013, a new work ‚Äò‚Äô OCCAM IX‚Äô‚Äô was composed for her by Eliane Radigue, and she premiered the piece at the San Francisco Electronic Music Festival.

Viking Press) Cover art by Susanne Suba Mrs. Bridge is the debut novel of American author Evan S. Connell, published in 1959. In 117 brief episodes, it tells the story of an upper middle-class, bourgeois family in Kansas City in the period between the First and Second World War, mostly from the perspective of the mother, the Mrs. Bridge of the title. Mrs. Bridge and her family are forced to deal with the changing habits and morality of the America of that time, especially in the areas of civil rights and gender equality. The book was followed in 1969 by Mr. Bridge. The two were adapted for the screen and were released as Mr. and Mrs. Bridge (1990). Synopsis Evan Connell has said the character of India Bridge is based on his mother. His mother was an eccentric woman named Ruth who, however, preferred to be called \\"Elton\\". He said his mother was dying of cancer at the time the book was published in 1959, and she never read the book. Connell, like the family in the story, grew up in Kansas City.Evan Connell interview accessed 11/23/2016 The titular character, India Bridge, is a wife and mother of three in a well-to-do middle-class family in Kansas City. Her husband, Walter, is a lawyer who spends most of his time at the office. Mrs. Bridge's life revolves around her children and much of it plays out in the home and in and around the country club, in a social environment whose primary values are \\"unity, sameness, consensus, centeredness\\". Her fears and anxieties are revealed through her actions rather than spelled out; one moment of \\"inarticulate rage,\\" as one reviewer called it, occurs when her son uses one of the guest towels: \\"'These towels are for guests,' said Mrs. Bridge, and felt herself unaccountably on the verge of tears\\".Connell 25. She is particularly though vaguely disturbed by \\"her son's penchant for coming into the house through the 'servants' entrance' rather than through the front door\\", since it forces her into thinking about class. Though the 117 vignettes are chronologically organized, from the 1920s to the early 1940s, there is not much in the way of plot, consistent with Mrs. Bridge's life in which nothing dramatic seems to happen, and her first name, \\"India\\", is indicative of the elusiveness of life and excitement: \\"It seemed to her that her parents must have been thinking of someone else when they named her\\". As the novel progresses it becomes clear that the elusiveness of the excitement that could be associated with her first name is symptomatic, and Mrs. Bridge goes from one almost-realization to the next. Her almost- realization of class difference occurs when she is struck, in a bookshop, by a book called Theory of the Leisure Class (a social critique of conspicuous consumption), a book she skims through and is disquieted by. One of her friends, Gracie, asks her if she also feels sometimes as if she is \\"all hollowed out in the back\\", a question Mrs. Bridge remembers only when she hears that her friend has killed herself. Mr. Bridge, though longer since (according to one critic) his life is more complicated, deals with the same \\"key moments\\". Gerald Shapiro referred to this as the \\"double exposure\\" of the two novels--\\"a curious double exposure, like a photograph taken once in shadow, once in light.\\" Reception and legacy The novel has been somewhat neglected, overshadowed perhaps by the simultaneously appearing debuts of Philip Roth, John Updike, and Richard Yates. By 1962, when critic Michael Robbins proclaimed that Mrs. Bridge answered the question asked by writer and social critic, \\"what kind of people we are producing, what kinds of lives we are leading\\", the novel was already out of print: readers of College Composition and Communication were urged to write the publishers in hopes of getting the book reprinted. In 1982, when both Bridge books were republished, Brooks Landon, in The Iowa Review, commented that \\"Connell seems to have become one of those writers we know to respect but may not have read\\". Writers and critics, however few, continue to praise its sensitivity and importance; Tom Cox, in The Guardian, writes that it is \\"one of the sharper novels about mid-20th-century domestic life\\". Critic Mark Oppenheimer, writing in The Believer, called Mrs. Bridge one of Connell's \\"three classics of Wasp repression\\" (the other two being the novels Mr. Bridge and The Connoisseur). American novelist James Patterson, who said Mrs. Bridge was the one novel that probably influenced him the most (Joshua Ferris is another admirer), said it and Mr. Bridge \\"capture the sadness, and boredom, of the unexamined life\\" and praises the compassion and precision of Connell's writing. British critic Matthew Dennison (who praised the \\"studiedly simple, undecorated prose, with few rhetorical flourishes\\") compared the main character to Jan Struther's Mrs. Miniver; both inhabit \\"an interwar world shaped by a promise of certainties ‚Äî domestic, social, cultural and sexual ‚Äî which are never wholly realised and remain frustratingly elusive\\". Publication history Mrs. Bridge began as a short story, \\"The Beau Monde of Mrs. Bridge\\", published in the Fall 1955 issues of The Paris Review.The magazine republished the story on the occasion of Connell's death, in January 2013. Both Mrs. Bridge and Mr. Bridge were republished in the United States in 2005 by Shoemaker & Hoard, Washington, D.C. The fiftieth anniversary of the novel (in 2009) was celebrated with a special edition of the novel, with photographs by Laurie Simmons and an introduction by Mark Oppenheimer.

Albarn and producer Richard Russell had previously worked on Bobby Womack's comeback album The Bravest Man in the Universe and on the DRC Music album Kinshasa One Two. Background Clocking in at seven minutes and five seconds, \\"You and Me\\" is the longest song on Everyday Robots, being an amalgamation of two different songs, the first being called \\"You\\" and the other being \\"Me\\", which was explained by Albarn when he played at the BBC Radio 6 Festival. The two songs were recorded by Albarn and the album's producer Richard Russell. Lyrically the songs reference the story of two people, each living separate lives and Albarn serving as a narrator over both lives. In an interview with Q Magazine, Albarn, spoke about many influences for the song. Albarn, who has long since been clean of drugs, began his relationship with heroin \\"at the height of Britpop\\" after he came home from tour one evening and casually found it in his front room. \\"I just thought, 'Why not?' I never imagined it would become a problem.\\" He then recites a line from the track \\"You and Me\\" to the reporter, which is a song on his forthcoming solo album, Everyday Robots. \\"Tin foil and a lighter, the ship across,\\" he sang. \\"Five days on, two days off. I'm happy I found that poetry,\\" Albarn went on to say. \\"I can move forward now without all the nudge nudge, wink wink innuendo I've had in the background for years.\\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/damon-albarn-on-blur-drug- addiction-heroin-made-me-incredibly-productive-9218773.html Critical reception Matthew Horton of NME wrote about the track in his track-by-track review of the album: \\"Call it the fulcrum of the record. 'You And Me' is an elusive epic that, like other songs to come, seems to pick over Albarn's life and manor with shouts to All Saints Road and Westbourne Grove. \\"Jab, jab/Digging out a hole in Westbourne Grove/Tinfoil and a lighter/The ship across/Five days on and two days off\\" ‚Äì he's probably not giving us details of his miracle diet. This is Albarn reliving 'My Heroin not-quite Hell; it was actually a rather creative period, now you ask'.

Clanbrassil sat in the Irish House of Commons as the Member of Parliament for Down between 1634 and 1635.

This defiance of a father's wishes, particularly in such a young girl, was almost unprecedented at the time. Mary, however, was noted from an early age for her extraordinary strength of character.

(2011, April 27).West Tampa Library approaches century mark. Tampa Tribune, p. B20. The library is a historic link between the establishment of the City of West Tampa, the Cigar industry, and Latin and African-American communities. West Tampa was incorporated on May 18, 1895, with its population being nearly 3,000 and is considered one of Tampa's earliest suburban towns. In the period from 1900 to 1920, West Tampa saw enormous growth when its cigar factories were flourishing and commercial structures were being erected rapidly. It was Hillsborough County's only free public library until 1917.Scherzer, A. (2011, June 10). West Tampa library digs for memories. Tampa Tribune, p. B2. Construction of the Neo-classical revivalist style brick building was funded with a $17,500 grant from Andrew Carnegie. Residents voted in a special election to accept the donation and a yearly tax to pay for the library's operating costs. The vote was 352 to 1. Land for the library was donated by cigar factory owner Angel Cuesta.Angel Cuesta's Legacy Reaches to Spain As a result of the high number of cigar factories in the area, the library had a Spanish-language reading section that cigar factory workers used frequently. English, Spanish, and Italian were spoken in the library because of West Tampa's ethnic diversity at that time. It is one of eleven Carnegie libraries built in Florida. The structure has been listed on the National Register Listing since 1983 and as a Local Historic Designation since 1988.City of Tampa Local Historic Landmarks The library is now a branch of the Tampa-Hillsborough County Public Library System. Of the two Carnegie Libraries that originally opened in the Tampa area, the West Tampa Branch Library is the only one that is still currently open to the public. The library celebrated its centennial in January 2014. Restoration and expansion In 2004, the library completed a major renovation and expansion. This renovation made the historic library more accessible to everyone in the community and to allow for the addition of library materials and technology. The main floor became a second floor meeting room. An extension of 5,000 square feet was added to the back of the building, and what was once the basement level became the library's main reading room. It is now used as the West Tampa Branch Library, located at 2312 West Union Street. Land for the library building was donated by cigar factory owner Angel Cuesta. Decorations include stained glass and a triptych oil painting on canvas by artist Ferdie Pacheco titled Coming to Work, The Cigar Factory, Main Intersection is exhibited in the library's main foyer and a 2003 acrylic painting by Synthia St. James titled Kaleidoscope is located in the main reading room.West Tampa Library Hillsborough County Public Library Cooperative As part of the library's 100th anniversary, it is taking part in the LIbrary History Roadshow.

His position was not uncommon among religious scholars, who based their history on the Bible. Historians including Fawn McKay Brodie, a 20th-century biographer of Joseph Smith, founder of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, suggest that View influenced the Book of Mormon (1830), because of the strong \\"parallelisms\\" found between the two. Early life and education Born in 1762 into a pious home in Belchertown, Massachusetts, Smith abandoned religion following the early deaths of his parents.William B. Sprague, Annals of the American Pulpit (New York: Robert Carter & Bros., 1866), II, 296‚Äì300. After a prolonged inner struggle, he joined the Congregational Church in 1781, and shortly thereafter began training for the ministry. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1790, though finding \\"but little of the spirit of religion there.\\" Smith served congregations for several years at a time in New Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts. He accepted an appointment as \\"City Missionary\\" in Boston. He also served as a supply pastor for vacant pulpits. \\"He was a warm friend of what he accounted pure revivals of religion; though he was careful to distinguish the precious from the vile\\" in matters of religious experience. Smith enjoyed a \\"robust constitution and vigorous health\\" and continued to preach until within two weeks of his death. At eighty Smith's sight \\"became very dim, and he was no longer able to read, though he never became totally blind. So familiar was he with the Bible and Watts, that it was his uniform custom to open the book in the pulpit, and give out the chapter and hymn, and seem to read them; and he very rarely made a mistake, to awaken a suspicion that he was repeating from memory.\\" Ethan Smith died in Royalston, Massachusetts, in 1849. Smith wrote several books about the Bible and theology: *A Dissertation on the Prophecies (1809), *A Key to the Figurative Language of the Prophecies (1814), *A View of the Trinity, designed as an answer to Noah Webster's Bible News (1821), *Memoirs of Mrs. Abigail Bailey, * View of the Hebrews (1823), *Four Lectures on the Subjects and Mode of Baptism, *A Key to the Revelation (1833), and *Prophetic Catechism to Lead to the Study of the Prophetic Scriptures (1839). In View of the Hebrews (1823), Smith argued that Native Americans were descended from the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. Some striking parallels have been noted between his work and the Book of Mormon (1830), which Joseph Smith claimed to have received by revelation. When writing View of the Hebrews, Smith lived in Poultney, Vermont, a town with a population less than 2,000. Living there at the same time was Oliver Cowdery, who later served as Joseph Smith's scribe for the Book of Mormon. From 1821 to 1826, Ethan Smith was also pastor of the Congregational church that Cowdery may have attended with his family.Palmer, 59-60.Persuitte, Origins of the Book of Mormon, 105-06 Larry Morris, an LDS scholar, has argued that \\"the theory of an Ethan Smith-Cowdery association is not supported by the documents and that it is unknown whether Oliver knew of or read View of the Hebrews.\\"Larry E. Morris, \\"Oliver Cowdery's Vermont Years and the Origins of Mormonism,\\" BYU Studies 39:1 (2000). In her biography of Joseph Smith, Fawn Brodie wrote, \\"It may never be proved that Joseph saw View of the Hebrews before writing the Book of Mormon, but the striking parallelisms between the two books hardly leave a case for mere coincidence.\\"Fawn Brodie, No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet, 1945, (New York: Alfred A.

One of the first vampire films from Spain, it was inspired by similarly themed Italian and British vampire films that were being released during the same time period, such as Dance of the Vampires. It has been credited as being \\"the 1969 picture that hammered the final nail into the cinematic coffin of the bomb-shelter-era bombshell Anita Ekberg\\", as well as being \\"one of the most original gothic examples of Spanish horror\\". Plot The beautiful and virginal Sylvia (Anita Ekberg) is delighted to discover that she's inherited not only the noble title of countess, but has also inherited a castle located in the country. She excitedly calls her fiance, Dr. Piero Luciani (Gianni Medici), to tell him that she's going to travel to view the castle. Once there, she stops at a local inn for a drink, where she announces her destination and relation to the castle's inhabitants; this horrifies the townspeople. Unswayed by their reactions, Sylvia arrives at the castle and meets her uncle, Count Walbrooke (Juli√°n Ugarte), and beds down for the night. She is later awakened by the maidservant Blinka (Adriana Ambesi), who warns her that Walbrooke is a century-old vampire that means her harm. Blinka's attempts to draw Sylvia out of bed and out of the castle are interrupted by Walbrooke, who takes her into another room and whips her. Sylvia pleads with him to stop, only for Walbrooke to reveal that Blinka herself is also a vampire. The next morning, Sylvia attempts to leave but is persuaded to stay after Walbrooke tells her about her aunt Malenka, who was burned at the stake for being a witch. He convinces Sylvia that the family is cursed, and that because of her strong resemblance to Malenka, paired with her ties to the family, Sylvia is also cursed. Furthermore, Sylvia must remain at the castle and stay unmarried, otherwise the curse will worsen and affect those around her. As a result, Sylvia breaks off her engagement with Piero, who decides to travel to the castle out of concern for Sylvia. When he arrives at the same inn that Sylvia visited earlier in the film, Piero is filled in on the events by Brugard (Juanita Ram√≠rez), one of the inn's barmaids. He then travels to the castle, intending to stop Walbrooke from turning Sylvia into a vampire. The uncle's \\"vampire ploy\\" turns out to be a hoax he's using to drive his niece crazy. Cast *Anita Ekberg as Malenka/Sylvia Morel *Gianni Medici as Dr. Piero Luciani (as John Hamilton) *Diana Lorys as Bertha Zemis *Rosanna Yanni as Freya Zemis *C√©sar Benet as Max (as Guy Roberts) *Carlos Casaravilla as Dr. Horbinger *Fernando Bilbao as Vladis the Coachman *Paul Muller as Dr. Albert *Adriana Santucci as The Count's Maid *Aurelia Trevi√±o as Village Woman *Juanita Ram√≠rez as Brugard the Barmaid *Adriana Ambesi as Blinka (as Audrey Ambert) *Juli√°n Ugarte as Uncle/Count Walbrooke *Keith Kendal as Man Production Juli√°n Ugarte played the vampire uncle, Count Walbrooke, fresh from his appearance as the vampire in Paul Naschy's classic La marca del hombre lobo (1968). Boris Karloff was initially approached to star in the film, but he eventually turned down the role following contractual wrangles, and died before the film was completed. The musical score by Carlo Savina (later the music director of films such as The Godfather and Amarcord) was reused in the 1971 low-budget horror film La notte dei dannati. An alternative supernatural ending was added to the English-language version of the film, in which the uncle disintegrates into a skeleton at the end, apparently indicating that he really was a vampire and contradicting the rest of the film. Release Malenka was released in Spain on 3 August 1969. Upon its release, producers offered \\"free psychiatric care\\" for anyone disturbed by Malenka or either of the two other films they were showing, Curse of the Living Dead and Revenge of the Living Dead.

Early life and education CƒÉlin was born in a poor Jewish family in Ia≈üi, in north-eastern Romania. After finishing high school, he obtained a medical degree from the local university. During his teen years, along with other young students, he frequented the Circle of Social Studies organized by socialists Leon Ghelerter and Max Vexler. The Circle, the main left-wing association in Moldavia at the time, played a major role in shaping future leaders of the Romanian socialist movement, such as Mihail Gheorghiu Bujor and Ilie Moscovici. Beside participating in the Circle, CƒÉlin lectured on natural and social sciences for a local adult school. Beginning with 1908, he published regularly in the Viitorul Social magazine, with his articles targeting primarily theoretical and tactical issues. Among his noted contributions of the time are a brief biography on Karl Marx, providing an analysis of the latter's contributions to the development of scientific socialism, and a history of the Paris Commune, presented as a proof of the viability of proletarian rule. During the same period, CƒÉlin also worked towards the establishment of a socialist youth organization. In 1910 he was one of the representatives of the Ia≈üi socialists at the Congress that formalised the creation of the Social Democratic Party (PSD). After graduating in 1911, with the support of fellow party-members, CƒÉlin left for Western Europe in order to further his medical studies. Following a brief stay in Berlin, he arrived in Paris, where he joined the existing Romanian socialist group comprising, among others, Christian Rakovsky, Ioan Sion and Barbu LƒÉzƒÉreanu. CƒÉlin used the occasion to forge relations with the local socialist party. Continuing his theoretical pursuits, he was particularly influenced by the ideas Jean Jaur√®s, embracing pacifism. Activism and war Returning to Romania, CƒÉlin settled in Bucharest and practised medicine, specializing as an internist. At the same time he continued his journalistic activity, writing for Viitorul Social and Rom√¢nia Muncitoare, and lectured on the history of socialist doctrines for the Socialist School set up by the party in Romania's capital. Along with many of the leading party members, CƒÉlin was one of the founding members of Casa Poporului, a cooperative society established in October 1914 in order to manage the various party headquarters across Romania. As a recognition for his efforts, in 1913, the Executive Committee of the PSD designated him as the editor in chief of the second series of Viitorul Social, position he would hold until 1915. The main responsible with the magazine's columns on the international socialist movement, he also continued to contribute articles on major theoretical themes, such as parliamentarism, the universal vote, and the socialist attitude towards the war . Around this time, he also held, under the pseudonym Ioan Otescu, the weekly medical column in Seara, and published research articles in Higiena, concentrating on illnesses prevalent among the poor. Furthermore, CƒÉlin translated Gorky's The Mother and, along with Bujor, Karl Kautsky's commentary on the Erfurt Program. CƒÉlin (middle row, sixth from left) and other leaders of the Romanian Social Democratic Party at the 60th anniversary of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea (1915) A delegate to the 1914 PSD Congress, CƒÉlin advocated a more militant party position on the agrarian issue, and was decisive in the adoption of neutrality as the party's stance towards World War I. In October 1915, at the Extraordinary PSD Congress, he prepared the main report, which commented on the attitude of the European socialist movement towards the war. The report, critical of the Bureau of the Second International, adopted the anti-militarist stance of the first Zimmerwald Conference, while at the same time providing that, were Romania to join the war, the socialists would take no action that would damage the government. The report was approved by a large majority. At the same Congress, CƒÉlin was also elected to the party's Executive Committee, along with Ecaterina Arbore, Alecu Constantinescu, Gheorghe Cristescu, I.C. Frimu, Dimitrie Marinescu, and Christian Rakovsky. During the following months, he took part in the organisation of various anti-war protests across the country. In the second part of 1916, as Romania joined the war on the side of the Entente, CƒÉlin was drafted as a combat medic, and was later assigned to the military ambulance. Retreating to Moldavia along with the whole Romanian Army, he contracted typhus during the epidemic that ravaged the region during the war. Transported to Ia≈üi for treatment, he died there in early April 1917.

The manifestation, and especially the anti-war eulogy given by Bujor, which called on the Romanian workers to follow the example of the anti- monarchic revolution in Russia, resulted in a major crack-down by the authorities on the renascent socialist movement in Moldavia.

It was established as Michigan Avenue Grammar School in 1906.Home of the Travellers Hillsborough County Public Schools It became Robert E. Lee Elementary School in 1943 when Michigan Avenue was renamed Columbus Drive (Tampa). The school was located at 305 East Columbus Drive and was the first brick school building constructed in Hillsborough County, Florida. In 2004, it became Lee Elementary School of Technology/World Studies. The school's colors are royal blue and gold and its mascot is Robert E. Lee's horse Traveller. The school was renovated in 1989 and won a local historic preservation award. It reopened as Lee Elementary School, the first magnet school in Hillsborough County. In 2005, it became Lee Elementary School of Technology/World Studies with its curriculum expanded to include a world studies. In July, 2015, children spoke before the district school board, asking that the school's name be change because it was offensive. Hillsborough County School District Board members did not discuss the issue. Amid ongoing controversy, in June, 2017, board member Tamara Shamburger asked the board to consider the name change while a man wearing a Confederate uniform stood silently observing the meeting. On September 12, 2017, the school caught fire shortly after power was restored to the area. The school had been closed, along with all other schools in Hillsborough County, due to Hurricane Irma. The flames began in the central section of the building on the second floor and spread quickly. It is unclear as to what caused the fire, but because the power had been out in the area following Hurricane Irma, it is possible that the fire began due to electrical issues that were previously undetected and not due to arson. At this point, the building appears to be a total loss. Students, faculty, and staff will spend the remainder of the 2017/18 school year and all of the 2018/19 school year on the campus of nearby Lockhart Elementary Magnet School . On October 16, 2018, the Hillsborough County School Board voted unanimously to have the school rebuilt, using the preserved surviving exterior.

Life and career Ree Morton was born on August 3, 1936 in Ossining, New York. A mother of three and the former wife of a navy officer, Morton lived a relatively nomadic life and began her artistic practice as a hobby through drawing. She decided to become a full-time artist in the late 1960s, receiving a BFA from the University of Rhode Island in 1968 and an MFA from the Tyler School of Art at Temple University in 1970.\\"Biography\\", Alexander and Bonin, Retrieved 27 October 2014. Morton worked in a variety of mediums including sculpture, drawing and installation.Perret, Mai-Thu. \\"Ree Morton\\" , Frieze, Retrieved 27 October 2014. Morton deployed \\"confrontational innocence,\\" as described by art historian Lucy Lippard, and humor in her sculptures that referenced everyday decorative forms such as curtains, ruffles and swags. Morton self-described her work as \\"light and ironic on serious subjects without frivolity.\\" Her piece Bake Sale (1974), for instance, was spurred on by a male faculty member at the Philadelphia College of Art who suggested that women on the faculty should stick to bake sales. Formally, Bake Sale (which features a comically low table covered with cakes and pastries against a wall of Celastic bows) typifies the playful interrelationships of objects Morton sought to create in her work. Curator Marcia Tucker describes Morton's work as \\"unusual in its totality; it incorporates painting, sculpture, real and crafted objects, natural and artificial materials. The work is intelligent without being intellectual, narrative without being literary and ironic without being whimsical. Its multiplicity, contradictory and slightly perverse nature, its response to natural forms and its sources in primitive human phenomena result in a unique sculptural mode.\\" Morton's art frequently combined an interest in poetry, language, and semiotics. Though she mostly received attention for her sculptural work during her lifetime, Morton continued to draw, write and sketch throughout her career. Morton died at the age of 40 in a car accident in Chicago, Illinois on April 30, 1977.\\"Ree Morton\\", Annmarie Verna Gallery, Retrieved 27 October 2014. Public works =Artpark residency= From July 21 to August 17, 1976, Ree Morton participated in the residency program at Artpark in Lewiston, New York. Her work there was created around the natural beauty and the history of the site involving both painting and landscape.Artpark. Artists Arriving at Artpark. 1976. Artpark Archives. Burchfield Penney Art Center Archives, Burchfield Penney Art Center, Buffalo. She developed two works during the residency, Regarding Landscape, and The Maid of the Mist. In Regarding Landscape, Morton utilized a pre-existing wall in front of a waterfall along the Upper Gorge Trail. There she started by decorating the wall with arches, drapery, roses, and streamers. In her statement in the Artpark Visual Arts Program catalog, Morton specified that her intention was, ‚Äúto increase the theatrical, dramatic quality already present at the site; to make the location as much like a diorama as possible.‚ÄùArtpark. Artpark: The Program in Visual Arts. Lewiston, New York: Artpark, 1979. Print The second part of this piece was to glue paintings of various shots of the landscape onto surrounding rocks, bordered by a colorful frame. The idea for this was for the paintings to be juxtaposed to the actual landscape that it references. For Maid of the Mist, Morton painted a thirty-five-foot ladder yellow and decorated it with Celastic ribbons and roses and incorporated two life preservers decorated with flowers and streamers into the event as well.Ed. Firmin, Sandra. Artpark: 1974-1984. New York: Princeton Architectural Press, n.d. Print. The ladder was placed on the hill, going into the water, with one life preserver in the water tied to the shore and another tied to Morton‚Äôs waist. She cut the rope connecting the life preserver floating in the water and released it into the current. This piece directly references the legend of the Maid of the Mist, where a maiden was sent over the falls as a bride to the Niagara river. Morton refers to The Maid of the Mist as both a ‚Äúsymbolic rescue‚Äù and a ‚Äúmemorial event‚Äù. = Something in the Wind = Developed in 1974, Something in the Wind was an installation of over one hundred flags on the schooner Lettie G. Howard at the South Street Seaport Museum in New York. Each hand-sewn flag featured the first name of someone close to Morton, from her children to artists such as Barbara Kruger, Rosemary Mayer, Italo Scanga, and Laurie Anderson, along with an associated drawing. Originally conceived as an installation for Rockefeller Center, the piece was intended to bring private life and relationships into public space.  Reception and early exhibition history  Ree Morton‚Äôs work has been revered by artists, critics and curators since 1973 when her Souvenir Piece was the inaugural exhibition at Artists Space (selected by Nancy Graves) in 1973. In December, Artforum published Lucy Lippard‚Äôs essay Ree Morton: At the Still Point of the Turning World (reprinted in Lippard‚Äôs seminal 1976 book From the Center). Morton had a solo exhibition in the lobby gallery of the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1974. Legacy and posthumous exhibition history Following her untimely death, in 1980 the New Museum in New York City presented Ree Morton: Retrospective 1971-1977, organized by Alan Schwartzman and Kathleen Thomas. The exhibition traveled to the Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago, Albright-Knox Art Gallery (Buffalo, NY), University of Colorado Museum (Boulder), and to the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston. In 2000, the Robert Hull Fleming Museum at the University of Vermont hosted an exhibition titled The Mating Habits of Lines: Sketchbooks and Notebooks of Red Morton, curated by Morton's friend, the artist Barbara Zucker. The exhibition also traveled to the Rosenwald Wolf Gallery at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. Morton enjoyed a successful artistic career during her lifetime, and has often been cited as an inspiration by a diverse group of artists including Lari Pittman, Jeanne Silverthorne and more recently, Alex DaCorte. In 2007, Marc Foxx Gallery in Los Angeles, organized For Ree which included the work of Jim Hodges, Evan Holloway, Susan Philipsz, Amada Ross-Ho and Frances Stark, alongside works by Morton. Between 2008 and 2015, three solo museum exhibitions on Morton were organized. An extensive exhibition of her work was displayed at the Generali Foundation in Vienna, Austria in 2008; an exhibition of her works on paper and related sculpture was shown at Drawing Center in New York in 2009, titled At the Still Point of the Turning World after a T.S.

He helped lead the Ili Rebellion of 1944, which led to the founding of the Second East Turkestan Republic (Three Districts) in northern Xinjiang. Abbas, along with Ehmetjan Qasim, headed the Marxist faction within the Three Districts, which in 1946 set aside the rebellion's declaration of independence and joined the Nationalist Chinese in forming a coalition provincial government. Qasim and Abbas led the Three Districts in joining the Chinese Communists toward the end of the Chinese Civil War. They and several other senior leaders of the Three Districts perished in August 1949 in a plane crash while traveling en route to Beiping (Beijing) where they were invited to participate in the Chinese Communists' political consultative conference, which resulted in the founding of the People's Republic of China.

At that time, Sheng Shicai, the ruler of Xinjiang who had been friendly to the Soviet Union, shifted his political allegiance to the Chinese Nationalist government, and launched a crackdown on leftist pro-Soviet activities. Abbas' father was arrested and Abbas was expelled from school and sent to teach at a primary school in Shawan County in the Junggar Basin of northern Xinjiang. In Shanwan, he translated Mao Zedong's essay On Protracted War into Uyghur. In 1942, he was permitted to return home to Yining where he initially taught at the Ili High School for Girls and then served as an interpreter for the local government. =Ili Rebellion= In April 1944, Abbas along with the influential Yining imam Elihan Tore and Rahimjan Sabir Khoja formed the 12-person Yining Liberation Organization to free the region of Nationalist rule.(Chinese) Âä®Ëç°‰πãÊ∫êÔºöÊñ∞ÁñÜ‰∏âÂå∫Èù©ÂëΩÁöÑÂõΩÈôÖËÉåÊôØ „ÄäË•øÂüüÁ†îÁ©∂„Äã 2013 No. 3 2014-01-10 To evade government surveillance, Abbas relocated to Korgas where he received assistance and materiel from the Soviet Union.

Abdulkerim Abbas became the Interior Minister. Unlike the Islamists and Turkic nationalists, who wanted to create a pan-Turkic regime in Xinjiang, Abbas regarded the revolution as a struggle against Nationalist Chinese repression and capitalist exploitation of the working-class people of all ethnicities. He opposed a proposal to remove all Han Chinese from Yining to concentration camps in K√ºnes County. He issued orders protecting Han Chinese residents in Ili and moved the families of Han friends and associates into his house for protection. After the fighting ceased in Yining, the ETR government, at his direction, created a Han Affairs Office to assist Han Chinese residents, published a Chinese newspaper, reopened the Han Primary School and founded an orphanage for Han children.(Chinese) Êü¥ÊÅíÊ£Æ \\"ÈòøÂ∑¥Á¥¢Â§´ÂíåÊ±âÊóè‰∫∫Ê∞ë‰∫≤Â¶Ç‰∏ÄÂÆ∂\\" Tianshannet 2008-05-15 On April 8, 1945, the various guerilla and partisan units of the revolution was organized into the Ili National Army (INA) and Abbas became its political director.

It is an integrated primary, middle and high school with around 550 pupils. Founded in 1926, it is one of the oldest Waldorf schools worldwide. It is generally regarded as one of the most prestigious schools in Norway and many of its alumni have been noted in the arts, politics and other areas of society. The school is an independent non-profit foundation governed by a board consisting of representatives of the teachers and parents, and it is a member of the Norwegian Association of Waldorf Schools. History Novelist Jens Bj√∏rneboe teaching at Oslo Waldorf School in 1952 In November 1921, two years after the first Waldorf School was founded in Stuttgart, Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner held two lectures on education at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo (then named Christiania), and the plan to establish a Waldorf school in Oslo was conceived. Among those involved was Bokken Lasson, who also became one of the first teachers when the school was established in 1926. The school was originally located in Oscars gate in the Frogner district. As of 1932, the school had 102 pupils. Due to financial difficulties, the school had to close in 1936. Vult Simon and Gulle Brun however continued to operate a small Waldorf school in their home at Makrellbekken. In the autumn of 1945 the school was reestablished, and was located in a barracks in Frogner Park. In 1949, the school moved to Smestad, and in 1962, it moved to Hovseter, where it is still located. Its building complex has been successively extended over the years in different architectural styles. Prior to 1961, the school received no public funding, and was funded entirely by tuition and gifts as well as by idealistic teachers who worked for relatively little pay. The school became entitled to regular public funding under the Private School Act of 1970. Originally a primary school and later also a middle school, the first high school class was established in 1978. The famous Norwegian novelist Jens Bj√∏rneboe worked as a teacher at the school in the 1950s and a private school obviously modelled after Oslo Waldorf School has a significant role in his Jonas novel, which is noted for its criticism of the public school system. He later published the book Under en mykere himmel; brev og bud fra en Steinerskole (\\"Under a softer sky; letters and messages from a Waldorf school\\") based on his work as a Waldorf teacher.Erik Marstrander, Menneske f√∏rst! Steinerpedagogikk i Oslo 1926-1996, Oslo, 1996. In Norway, anthroposophy in general and the Waldorf schools in particular have been strongly associated with the cultural and intellectual elite of the country since the early 20th century, and among the school's alumni and parents are many noted individuals, particularly within the arts and the cultural sphere, but also within politics and business.Hundre √•rs tosomhet, Morgenbladet, 19 Dec 2008 Among the school's alumni is former Labour leader, Prime Minister and now NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, and current Labour leader and former Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr St√∏re is a parent at the school.St√∏res verdivalg, VG The school and the Waldorf movement in general was a stronghold of the Riksm√•l language of the traditional elite during the Norwegian language struggle, and the school is still using the now classic alphabet book Andr√© Bjerkes ABC, published by Riksm√•lsforbundet in 1959.Olav √òstrem, P√• Bj√∏rneboes skuldre, Klassekampen, 10 September 2009 The arts play a major role in the school curriculum and the broader activities surrounding the school, and the school includes a professionally equipped theater hall.

They are one of the few trail remnants left of the Ox Bow Trail, which originated at Nebraska City, Nebraska and connected to the Oregon Trail and the Mormon Trail. In 1992, they were listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Background During the early 1840s, early American pioneers began migrating west to places such in Oregon, California, and Utah, which would later become states of the United States. They followed the Oregon and Mormon trails, which followed on either side of the Platte river in what is now modern day Nebraska. The Oregon Trail ran along the south side of the Platte and the Mormon Trail ran along the North side. Both the Oregon and Mormon trails had multiple starting points along the Missouri River. The major starting points included Independence, St. Joseph, Nebraska City, and Council Bluffs-Omaha. From each of these locations (and others) there were multiple routes to the main Oregon and Mormon trails. As American pioneers increasingly began moving west in the 1840s, the US army began searching for sites to build forts for protection of the pioneers. Lt. Daniel Phineas Woodbury was charged with finding new locations for forts along the Platte river. He found and supervised the building of Fort Kearney and he established one of several alternate trails from Nebraska City to Fort Kearney. The route that he discovered in 1847 would come to be known as the Woodbury cutoff or Woodbury trail. The Upper Oak Creek Descent Ruts are along the Woodbury Trail in Butler county, Nebraska. Description The ruts were created from 1847 to 1860 by the wagon wheels of the wagons pioneers used to move westward. The segment of preserved ruts is approximately in length running through unploughed prairie. This segment of ruts is one of the few remaining remnants of the Woodbuy Cutoff due to extensive agriculture in eastern Nebraska where the trail once ran. The ruts are approximately wide at their eastern edge and run southwest along a ridge for about at which point the trail curves to the west. As the trail turns west, it descends to Oak Creek. As of 1992, the total length of the remaining wagon wheel ruts was .

The residential development was formerly named The Oaks at Biscayne Landing. The property is bordered to the east by the Biscayne Bay campus of Florida International University and David Lawrence Jr. K-8 Center, and to the west by commercial developments along Biscayne Boulevard. The property is named for its location at the intersection of that roadway and Northeast 151st Street. In 2007, Boca Developers constructed the towers in the first phase of what was planned to be a larger mixed-use development, Biscayne Landing. The company‚Äôs lender filed foreclosure action in 2009 and no other buildings were constructed. The project went into bankruptcy. That same year, iStar Residential, a division of iStar Financial, purchased 160 of the unsold residences and leased a majority of them while the South Florida real estate market was in recovery. In late 2013, the homeowners association renamed the towers as One Fifty One at Biscayne. Also in late 2013, iStar Residential hired DevStar Realty, a wholly owned subsidiary of The DevStar Group, to manage repositioning and sales. Dev Star Group principals had turned around two other local condominium projects ‚Äî Paramount Bay in Miami and Ocean House on South Beach.

Career Bailey attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he received a B.S. degree in 1961, followed by an M.S. in Art and Art Education in 1962. In 1962, Bailey served as a technical assistant to Harvey Littleton, who was conducting glassblowing seminars at the Toledo Museum of Art. Over the next five years, Bailey traveled the country accepting invitations to teach, from the People's Art Center in St. Louis, Missouri to positions with the University of Iowa, and the University of South Dakota. During this period Bailey received a Louis Comfort Tiffany grant (1963), and was appointed artist-in-residence at University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, where he taught ceramics for the following three years. At the request of Robert Arneson, Bailey taught Arneson's classes at the University of California, Davis while Arneson was on sabbatical in 1967. In 1968, Bailey relocated to northern California, where he became a leading figure in the ceramic vein of the regional Funk art movement, pioneered by Arneson. Much of the Funk art activity was centered around UC Davis, where other prominent figures in the movement (Roy De Forest, Manuel Neri, William T. Wiley, David Gilhooly, Chris Unterseher, Margaret Dodd) either taught, or attended classes. A leading venue for exhibiting Funk art was at the Candy Store Gallery, located in nearby Folsom, California, where Bailey would regularly present work in the context of both solo and group shows. In 1968, Bailey began teaching at California State University, Hayward (now California State University, East Bay). He retired from this position in June 1996, with the title of Professor Emeritus of Ceramics. In 1970, Bailey established a home-studio space in rural Port Costa, California, where he became neighbors with fellow artist Roy De Forest. The two collaborated on numerous projects, and remained friends until De Forest's death in 2007. Overlapping the Funk art movement was Nut art, a term coined by De Forest, which brought together many of the same practitioners including Arneson, De Forest, and Gilhooly, along with Peter Saul, Jerry Gooch, Victor Cicanski, Richard Shaw, David Zack. In 1972, Bailey co-curated the first-ever Nut art show at California State University, Hayward. Stylistically, Bailey's work bridged several different categories and styles including Funk art, Nut art, ceramic and metallic sculpture, and Performance art. A recurring thread through all his work is humor, along with a high degree of craftsmanship. Another track for artistic expression developed with the creation of Bailey's alter ego Dr. George Gladstone, beginning in 1969. Initially, the works blended performance and creations based on pseudo-science and personal mythologies. Works included the creation of fossilized remains (usually ceramic or from earth materials) and the classification of a new time period, the Pre-Credulous Era, the source of such Kaolithic curiosities as a cyclops skull and a Bigfoot skeleton. Dressed in a lab coat and pith helmet, Bailey as Dr. Gladstone performed excavations and staged performances and pranks. The World of Wonders, a traveling museum dedicated to Dr. Gladstone's life and work was developed, and presented in various venues, beginning with the Richmond Art Center. In 1976, The World of Wonders Museum opened in downtown Port Costa, where it became a local tourist attraction until its closure in 1978. The collection is now split between Bailey's home-studio, and the Bailey Art Museum in downtown Crockett, California. Robot exhibit at the Bailey Art Museum Over the years, the Dr. Gladstone character evolved into something more akin to a mad scientist, allowing Bailey to explore other forms of art with pseudo-scientific origins and associations. Most notable have been sculptures based on robots, beginning in the late 1970s and continuing on to today, although this work is now presented, and credited as Bailey's, not Dr. Gladstone's. The latest offshoot of the metallic sculpture (built from found materials and objects) had been a series of Space Guns. In 1974, Bailey was profiled in Esquire Magazine as Dr. Gladstone. In the article written by Susan Subtle, \\"Their Arts Belong to Dada\\", Bailey was featured alongside artists Lowell Darling, Anna Banana, Ant Farm (group), Futzie Nutzle, Dr. Brute & Lady Brute, Mr. Peanut, Irene Dogmatic, AA Bronson, Captain Video, Flakey Rose Hip, Henry Humble, The Gluers and Dickens Bascom, Don and Rae Davis, and T.R. Uthco. Bailey continued to work in a variety of mediums and styles until his death. Throughout his career as an artist, Bailey exhibited regularly throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia in both solo and group exhibitions. In 2011, Bailey was honored with a 50-year retrospective exhibition (Clayton Bailey's World of Wonders) at the Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento, California. Bailey and his wife (fellow artist Betty Bailey), resided in Port Costa, California from 1970 until their deaths. Betty died on March 20, 2019. Bailey died at his Port Costa home on June 6, 2020. His health had deteriorated after a stroke in 2019. Bailey Art Museum In 2013, Bailey and his wife, artist Betty G. Bailey, founded the Bailey Art Museum in Crockett, California. The Bailey Art Museum is near the Bailey's former residence and studio in Port Costa. The space brings together works from across the artist's five decades plus career featuring examples of Funk art, Nut art, ceramics, and metal sculpture (including robots and space guns), as well as pseudo-scientific curiosities by the artist's alter-ego Dr. Gladstone. The museum also includes narrative watercolor drawings by Betty G. Bailey and a gift shop. Betty G.

He was a deputy from 1830 to 1839, and again from 1842 to 1846. Early years Baron Jean-Jacques Baude was born in Valence, Dr√¥me on 19 February 1792, where his father was Attorney General. He started work in his father's office in the prefecture of Tarn. Towards the end of the reign of Napoleon he joined the administration. He was appointed in turn sub-prefect of Confolens on 8 April 1813, sub-prefect of Roanne on 2 November 1814 and sub-prefect of Saint-√âtienne on 4 June 1815. Baude recognized Louis XVIII of France in the first restoration, but on the return of Napoleon placed himself at the head of the guards who opposed the advance of the Duke of Angoul√™me on Lyon. After the battle of Waterloo he resigned and published Le Lundi gras et le mercredi des Cenres (Fat Monday and Ash Wednesday), which was condemned by the royal court of Grenoble. He then became involved in financing public works. He wrote a remarkable work on Navigation de la Loire au-dessur de Briare in 1826. He continued to attack the government in the liberal press. As editor of Le Temps he signed the protest of journalists against the ordinances of King Charles X of France. July Monarchy The July Revolution, which brought his political friends to power, at first gave Baude an important place in the Orl√©anist party. He was named Secretary of the Municipal Commission of Paris on 29 July 1830. On 1 August 1830 he was named Secretary General of the Ministry of the Interior, and for a few days was acting Minister until Fran√ßois Guizot took the portfolio on 11 August 1830. He was then general director of bridges and roads, and of mines, and Councillor of State. On 28 October 1830 he was elected a Deputy for the department of the Loire. On 10 November, when the Count of Montalivet succeeded Guizot, Baude was appointed Under-Secretary of State for the Interior. On 26 December 1830 he replaced Treilhard at the Prefecture of Police, and remained in charge until 25 February 1831. On 14 February 1831, the anniversary of the death of Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, Baude had to deal with disturbance that were suppressed by the National Guard. This led to questions in the Assembly and he was replaced. On 15 March 1831 Baude presented a proposal supported by the president of the council, Casimir P√©rier, that was adopted, to ban king Charles X of France, his descendants and allies of his descendants in perpetuity from French territory. This was adopted after discussions and amendments. Baude failed to be reelected on 5 July 1831. On 1 March 1832 he was elected for Roanne. He generally voted for the majority. He was reelected on 21 June 1834, on 4 November 1837 and on 9 July 1842. He failed to be reelected on 1 August 1846, which ended his career in the Assembly. After returning to private life he authored various papers on the navigation of the Loire, the Isthmus of Suez, Algeria, and the Channel coast (1859). He died in Paris on 6 February 1862.

NOPEC has been the Congressional effort to address the issue that, under federal law, foreign governments cannot be sued for predatory pricing or failing to comply with federal antitrust laws. Thus, the purpose of the bill was to extend similar Sherman Antitrust consumer protection, so as to include protection against collusion and predatory pricing by foreign governments and international cartels, such as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\\"Congress takes aim at OPEC; Bush vows veto\\", The Houston Chronicle, 05/23/07. As written and passed, H.R. 2264: > Amends the Sherman Act to declare it to be illegal and a violation of the > Act for any foreign state or instrumentality thereof to act collectively or > in combination with any other foreign state or any other person, whether by > cartel or any other association or form of cooperation or joint action, to > limit the production or distribution of oil, natural gas, or any other > petroleum product (petroleum), to set or maintain the price of petroleum, or > to otherwise take any action in restraint of trade for petroleum, when such > action has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect on the > market, supply, price, or distribution of petroleum in the United States. It also summarizes enforcement parameters as follows: > Denies a foreign state engaged in such conduct sovereign immunity from the > jurisdiction or judgments of U.S. courts in any action brought to enforce > this Act. States that no U.S. court shall decline, based on the act of state > doctrine, to make a determination on the merits in an action brought under > this Act.

Controversy surrounding passage under veto threat  At the time of passage, U.S. motorists were paying $3.21/gallon for gasoline. The London- based Center for Global Energy Studies cited OPEC restrictions on output as the driving force in pushing oil prices in 2008 to above $60/barrel. The study proposed that this OPEC-driven price increase was the central cause of the consumer gas price increase at the pump.\\"H.R.2264 - No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act of 2007\\" Open Congress, accessed 03/23/14. The many bipartisan supporters of the bill, in Congress and elsewhere, felt disavowed by President Bush's staunch veto threats. Representative Conyers stated: \\"The Bush administration's threat to veto this bill is just further proof that the administration favors the international oil cartel over the American consumer.\\" Then-senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton both voted \\"yes\\" on NOPEC. Commodities trader and author Raymond J. Learsy put it this way: \\"In defiance of oil interests Congress voted overwhelmingly for the Bill (70 votes to 23 in the Senate and 345 to 72 in the House). This was an act of refreshing and courageous leadership by our Congress only to be abandoned after President George W. Bush, that great stalwart of oil interests and friend of Saudi Arabia, made it clear that he would veto the bill should it land on his desk.\\" Supporters of the veto included the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (USCC). In its 2007 letter to House members, the USCC stated opposition to the bill: \\"Although H.R. 2264 limits itself to restraint of trade in oil, natural gas, or petroleum products, it would create a dangerous precedent. There would be a domino effect: once sovereign immunity has been eliminated for one action of a state or its agents, it can be eliminated for all state actions and the actions of agents of the state.\\"\\"Letter Opposing H.R. 2264, the \\"No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act of 2007\\" U.S. Chamber of Commerce/R. Bruce Josten, accessed 03/24/14. Energy analyst Kevin Book noted that increased regulatory fears, as a result of NOPEC, could prompt a flight of capital. Others, including some officials in the oil-producing countries, also expressed concerns that \\"a nation caught up in the throes of a populist movement\\" might look to seize plants and even non-energy assets in the United States that are owned by these foreign governments or their affiliated companies. Some officials in the Bush Administration agreed that OPEC countries' United States assets could be targeted, if a court were to award damages in a resulting antitrust lawsuit. They further feared that this \\"would likely spur retaliatory action against American interests in those countries and lead to a reduction in oil available to U.S. refiners.\\" Economist Dambisa Moyo wrote: \\"It is beyond question that if OPEC member nations were private companies, they would have been fined heavily and/or had their executives put in jail in the United States or the United Kingdom.\\" Moyo cited the Bush veto of NOPEC, \\"for reasons of public policy\\" and in order to support market-based economies, as an indication to China that it too could also expect a continued \\"lack of any forceful international law,\\" regarding China's potential future international monopolistic policies for \\"influencing prices, and violating antitrust rules.\\"Dambisa Moyo (2012), Winner Take All, pp.134-135.  Ongoing debate and future possibilities  With a complete policy reversal of his position as senator, the Obama administration favored Citgo and the Venezuelan State Oil Company (PDVSA) in an amicus brief supporting the \\"sovereign immunity\\" defense for international commodity producers, in a 2011 U.S. District Court case.

It is located in the village of Mo. It is the church for the Mo parish which is part of the Nordhordland prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The white, wooden, neo-gothic church was built in a long church style in 1883 using designs by the architect Johannes √òvsthus. The church seats about 220 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1360, but it was likely built in the second half of the 12th century. The first church was a stave church. In 1593, the old church was torn down and replaced with a timber- framed building on the same site. This new church was a small tar-covered wooden church with a tower that seated about 130 people. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the church was remodeled and renovated several times, with an especially large addition to the east in 1831. In 1883, a new church was built just to the south of the old church and when it was completed, the old church was torn down and its materials were sold. Some of the items used in the old church were kept such as the altarpiece, baptismal font, candlesticks, as well as some old Bibles. The new church cost and it was consecrated on 11 July 1883. Historically, this church was an annex chapel that belonged to the Hamre prestegjeld (parish) until 1749. From 1749 until 1967 it was part of the Hosanger prestegjeld, being upgraded to the status of church at some point. In 1967, the church became part of the √òstereidet prestegjeld, based in Lind√•s municipality. Since 2004, the church has been the only church in the Mo parish which includes the whole municipality of Modalen.

Plot Ma Yuk-fung (Season Ma) is a simple-minded girl who would blindly do anything for love. Under the instigation of her triad member boyfriend Robert, Yuk-fung goes into prison to kill Winnie Wong to avenge Robert's triad boss, Man (Lam Chung). Yuk-fung was then guilty of drug possession and was imprisoned for six months. In prison, Yuk-fung misses Robert day and night, oblivious to the fact that Robert is just using her. In prison, Yuk-fung is bullied by inmate He-man, but fortunately gets help from inmates Crazy Bitch (Carrie Ng) and 5354 (Meg Lam) to avoid further bullying. 5354 is a recidivist who intentionally got pregnant before imprisonment whereby her sentence is halved. Nevertheless, 5354 and her child's father have feelings towards each other. Crazy Bitch is a disfigured murder felon who gives herself up in prison and often causes trouble. Later, due to Yuk-fung's sincere attitude, Crazy Bitch brightens up. They often talk about their own past. Crazy Bitch had a poor childhood where her family lived on a boat. As a child, she was sold by her drug addict father and became a prostitute who also got addicted to drugs. One night, she was harassed in a nightclub and was saved by a triad member, Yung (Andy Lau). The next day, Yung also negotiated with a rival gang for her and Yung was injured during a chaotic fight. Yung hid with Crazy Bitch in the public restroom and they became affectionate. Soon after, Crazy Bitch cohabited with Yung, which during that time, Yung helped her get rid of her drug addiction and she actively lived a new life. The two spent their happiest moments together. Later, Yung turned out to be an undercover cop who abhorred injustice as his foe. Crazy Bitch worried that his operation would fail and requested that they immigrate and start a new life in Canada together. Yung was then killed at the final moment by Man and Crazy Bitch's hopes were destroyed. Crazy Bitch avenged Yung and killed Man and his underlings in a sauna and was thus, sentenced to prison. In the process, she was also disfigured by a burning sauna stone. Yuk-fung finds a kitten in prison and secretly takes care of it. The friendship of Yuk-fung, Crazy Bitch and 5354 enhances over time. Yuk-fung and 5354 also look forward to their new lives with their boyfriend after their release from prison. But good times do not last as Crazy Bitch finds out in prison that her father died from drug abuse. Yuk-fung also discovers her assassination target, Winnie Wong, is actually Crazy Bitch. 5354 is then killed by a mentally disturbed inmate, Jenny (Ngai Suet), and her unborn baby is also killed. Yuk-fung thinks highly of her friendship with Winnie and refuses to abide with Robert. On the day of her release, Yuk-fung leaves with her kitten, waiting for Robert to pick her up but the conscienceless Robert runs her over with his car and crushes her to death. The kitten flees back into the prison and Winnie picks it up where the film ends with her sad expression.

Color to sound scales The Harbisson's Sonochromatic Music Scale Harbisson's Sonochromatic Music Scale (2003) is a microtonal and logarithmic scale with 360 notes in an octave. Each note corresponds to a specific degree of the color wheel. The scale was introduced to the first antenna in 2004. Modern Painters, The International Contemporary Art Magazine pp 70-73 (New York, June 2008) Harbisson's Pure Sonochromatic Scale (2005) is a non-logarithmic scale based on the transposition of light frequencies to sound frequencies. The scale discards color as being part of a color wheel and ignores musical/logarithmic perception so it can overstep the limits of human perception. The introduction of the new scale to the eyeborg in 2010, allows users to decide whether they want to perceive colors logarithmically or not.

Bahna (August 23, 1942 ‚Äì February 24, 2014) was an American business executive. Bahna served as the CEO of Cunard Line from 1980 until 1989 and Chairman of Priceline.com from 2004 to 2013. He also founded Club Quarters, a membership-based chain of hotels aimed at business travelers. Early life Bahna was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on August 23, 1942. He was the youngest of two children of Ralph and Frieda (n√©e Mushro) Bahna. His father was a lawyer. Bahna did not have a middle name, so he later added the initial \\"M\\" to his name. He enrolled at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he competed as a Big Ten Conference wrestler (He won the 123-pound title as a college senior). Bahna obtained a bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan in 1964. In 1965, he received a Master of Business Administration from the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. TWA Bahna was hired for the commercial sales department of Trans World Airlines (TWA). He became especially interested in business class, an airline travel class which was developing within the aviation industry during the 1960s and 1970s. He created a new plan for a potential TWA business class, with specific onboard amenities and seating areas. Once Bahna created his plan, he spent two years persuading TWA's executives to implement his idea, which became known as TWA‚Äôs Ambassador Class. The program was priced less than first class, but offered many of the amenities to business travelers. Ambassador Class revived TWA's profits and sparked similar business class programs throughout the airline industry. Cunard In 1973, Bahna became the head of Cunard Line's North American division at the age of 30, having been promoted from his previous position of Vice President of marketing and sales. He was further promoted to Cunard's President and COO of worldwide operations in 1977, when he was just 34 years old. In 1981, Bahna became the CEO of Cunard, becoming the first American to head Cunard's global operations. Cunard had suffered financial losses in 1979, so Bahna implemented as series of austerity measures aimed at cutting costs. For example, he negotiated a series of concessions, including cuts in pay increases, from British labor unions. Bahna moved planned renovations on the Queen Elizabeth 2 (QE2) from the United Kingdom to the Bethlehem Steel ship yard in Bayonne, New Jersey, where work would be cheaper. The move allowed the QE2 to sail directly to the Caribbean during the peak winter season once renovations were complete. During the mid-1980s, Bahna also oversaw the QE2's transformation from steam power to diesel power, which added an estimated 20 years to the lifespan of the ship. Bahna is credited not only with saving the QE2, but also with shaping the modern cruise industry itself. Bahna oversaw Cunard's acquisition of Norwegian America Line in 1983. In 1986, Bahna spearheaded Cunard's purchase of two cruise ships, the Sea Goddess I and Sea Goddess I, from Norske Cruise. Bahna also pioneered cruises to Alaska, which departed and disembarked at different ports of call. Trips to Alaska (along with separate departure and ending ports) are now a very common practice with the cruise industry. Ralph Bahna struck a deal with British Airways. The partnership allowed Cunard passengers to sail across the Atlantic Ocean on board a Cunard ship. The passengers could then return to the United Kingdom by flying on British Airways' Concorde. Cunard was soon the single largest purchaser of Concorde seats. Bahna stepped down as Cunard's CEO in 1989. Club Quarters In 1994, Bahna founded Club Quarters, a membership-based hotel chain aimed at business travelers. Bahna opened the first Club Quarters hotel on West 45th Street in Midtown Manhattan. In a 2012 interview, Bahna outlined his original goal for Club Quarters, saying he wanted \\"to have the best locations, be full service, charge less, and still make a big profit.\\" Under Bahna, the chain expanded to new locations near major corporate and financial centers. There are now Club Quarters branches located in major cities throughout the United States, as well as London. Priceline.com Ralph Bahna joined the board of directors of Priceline.com in 1998 when the website was established. Founded by Jay S. Walker, Priceline.com became a public company in 1998. Bahna became the chairman of Priceline.com in 2004, a position he held until his retirement on January 1, 2013. Later life In 2009, he and his wife, Dorothy, donated much of the funding needed to construct the Bahna Wrestling Center at his alma mater, the University of Michigan. Bahna died from cardiac failure at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, New York City, on February 24, 2014, at the age of 71. He was survived by his wife, Dorothy Ballard; three children: Laura Lovejoy, Deborah Chrabolowski, and Adam; and eight grandchildren. Bahna had been a resident of Stamford, Connecticut.

Little was born in Aurelius, New York, to James Little and Susan Young. His mother was a sister to Brigham Young. When Little was a young adult, his widowed mother became a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and moved to Nauvoo, Illinois. Little, much like his Uncle Brigham, was farmed out to relatives and family friends, apprenticing in several trades. Eventually, Little and some friends headed further west. At times, Little tried his hand at farming. In St Louis, Missouri, he started to prosper as a merchant. Evidently, his credit was good enough that while he left his business in the hands of an employee, while he traveled to Texas to visit with his brother James, who was serving there in the U.S. Army, upon his return, Little found the employee had sold all his goods and run off with the money. Still, he was able to get credit to buy more goods for his store. He traveled to Nauvoo in 1843, to visit family. He married one of the Decker sisters there within the year, and returned to his store in St. Louis. In 1850, Little followed family members who went with Young to the Salt Lake Valley. Though he was headed to California, he stopped for a while in Salt Lake City, where he decided to stay and try his hand in trade there. He was then not only a nephew to Young, but he also became a brother-in-law. And in Utah Territory, they were partners in at least three enterprises. One was the first saloon in Utah. Another was a gristmill in what became known as Sugarhouse. Young, a Decker brother-in-law, and Ephraim Hanks‚Äîanother brother-in-law‚Äîall co-owned five lumber mills at the mouths of five canyons by the Wasatch Mountains in Salt Lake Valley. The latter two brothers-in-law and Little also became partners as subcontractors in carrying the mail between Salt Lake City and points West of Kansas City. Little was the first contractor to build a canal in Utah, much of the telegraph line coming from eastern points to Salt Lake City; he also built the first territorial prison, which later became the Utah State prison, before it was demolished where Sugarhouse Park now is in Salt Lake City. Little was also a major subcontractor on the transcontinental railroad. He afterwards served on boards for various railroad lines running up and down the state in Utah, and on the boards of various banks. Little became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) after three or four years in Utah Territory. Besides being a businessman in Utah Territory, Little was elected the mayor of Salt Lake City for three consecutive terms (1876‚Äì78; 1878‚Äì80; 1880‚Äì82). He was elected as a member of the LDS Church-sponsored People's Party. On April 21, 1880, while mayor of Salt Lake City, Little was initiated as a member of the LDS Church's Council of Fifty.*. In 1872, Little had been a missionary for the LDS Church in New York, where he visited and preached to some of his relatives. Little also accompanied a coalition of LDS Church leaders around this time back east to New York, where they sailed first for Europe, visiting and touring through that continent, until they arrived in Palestine to rededicate that land for the return of the Jews. Little's oldest daughter by his first wife accompanied him on this trip; Eliza R. Snow‚Äîa polygamous wife of both Joseph Smith, and later Brigham Young, as well as the second general president of the Relief Society of the LDS Church‚Äîalso accompanied this group on this trip. Little died at Salt Lake City from typhoid fever. He was buried at the Salt Lake City Cemetery.

He served as Vice-Governor of Jiangxi from 2011 to 2014, and prior to that Chairman of the Jiangxi Development and Reform Commission, a provincial body with broad powers over the economy. He was removed from his posts and investigated by the Communist Party's anti-graft agency in March 2014. Biography Yao was born into a family of farmers and was raised in Ganzhu village, located near the city of Zhangshu, Jiangxi province. His father was a one-time village Communist Party branch secretary (essentially, the leader of the village). He was the first of three children. He graduated from Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics in 1986, where he majored in economics. After graduation, Yao worked in Jiangxi Planning Commission. In December 1998, he rose through the ranks to become the deputy director of Jiangxi Provincial General Office. In August 2000 he was promoted to become the Deputy Secretary General of Jiangxi People's Government and Chairman of Jiangxi Provincial General Office, a position he held until March 2007. In March 2007, Yao was promoted to become the Chairman of Jiangxi Development and Reform Commission. In 2009, internet postings surfaced alleging that Yao's niece had been smoking luxury-brand cigarettes and frequently sported a Louis Vuitton bag, attracting online criticism and speculation about his family's wealth. The Development and Reform Commission (Fagaiwei) is one of the most powerful bodies in the province. As Fagaiwei chief, Yao and his office was in charge of approving large investment and construction projects across the province. In May 2011, Yao was promoted to become the Vice-Governor of Jiangxi. This was not Yao's preferred position but he took up the job anyway; he was said to have wanted a seat on the provincial Party Standing Committee, the real center of power, and also take on a first-in-charge position as party chief of a major city. During his vice-governorship he visited his home village to attend the 80th birthday of his father. On March 22, 2014, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) announced that Yao was undergoing investigation for \\"serious violations of laws and regulations\\". It was said that Yao's investigation was a harbinger for the fate of former Jiangxi party chief Su Rong (term in Jiangxi 2007-2013) under whom Yao's career had flourished. Indeed, on June 14, 2014, Su Rong, who had then rose to become Vice-Chairman of the national legislative advisory body, was himself detained for investigation. On August 6, 2014, following the CCDI investigation, state media announced Yao's expulsion from the Communist Party of China. Yao was said to have abused his power for the illicit gain of others and taken bribes personally and through his family. Yao was arrested and arraigned by the Supreme People's Procuratorate. He was indicted on charges of bribery, then tried in the Intermediate People's Court in Xiamen. On December 18, 2015, Yao Mugen was sentenced to 13-year jail and confiscate personal property worth 3 million yuan (~$463,000) for taking bribes worth 23 million yuan by the court. Family Yao had two younger brothers, both of whom were also officials; one was a county party chief, another worked for a local prosecution agency. Yao was married to Yi Anping (), who was also detained for investigation. Yi was widely rumoured in Jiangxi province to also be a major shareholder of two listed companies headquartered in Jiangxi, though this has not been conclusively proven. A local resident being interviewed about the Yao case remarked, \\"there's rumours flying around everywhere about this... at least get a stranger to open up an account on your behalf [so it's not suspicious], it's ridiculous to think that he would let his wife take this on personally.\\" References External links Category:1957 births Category:People from Zhangshu Category:Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics alumni Category:Living people Category:Vice-governors of Jiangxi Category:Chinese politicians convicted of corruption ","title":"Yao Mugen"},{"id":"42290586","text":"The Serebryanka () is a river in Moscow Oblast, Russia, a tributary of the Ucha.

By the time David Garrick adapted The Country Wife into The Country Girl, Wycherley's play was considered too raunchy and scandalous to show in theaters. In The Country Girl the plot and characters of The Country Wife are reformed to exclude elements of the play which, at the time, were considered immoral or in bad taste.David Garrick, \\"The Country Girl, A Comedy,(altered from Wycherley) As it is Acted at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane\\", Eighteenth Century Collections Online, Gale Digital Collections., 1766. P.2 Alterations from The Country Wife In The Country Girl, the most significant changes to the plot result from the removal of Horner, who in The Country Wife pretended to be impotent in order to seduce the wives of other men, particularly Mrs. Pinchwife, the country wife that Wycherley's play is named after. Rather than a plot focused on Horner's schemes and other raunchy elements, The Country Girl features the romance between the young aristocrat, Belville and Miss Peggy, an unmarried country girl who replaces Mrs. Pinchwife, and on Harcourt's wooing of Alithea who is engaged to Mr. Sparkish. Additionally, Harcourt, previously a less-than-reputable friend of Horner's, is rewritten as Belville's responsible uncle and mentor. Early Performances The Country Girl was initially performed in 1766 at the Drury- Lane Theatre in Dublin. The playbill lists Mr. Holand as Moody, Mr. Palmer as Harcourt, Mr. Dodd as Sparkish, Samuel Cautherley as Belville, Mr. Strange as a Footman, Master Burton as a Country-Boy, Mrs. Palmer as Alithea, Miss Reynolds as Miss Peggy, and Miss Pope as Lucy.David Garrick, \\"The Country Girl, A Comedy,(altered from Wycherley) As it is Acted at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane\\", Eighteenth Century Collections Online, Gale Digital Collections., 1766 The Country Girl debuted in London in 1791 with Mr. King as Moody, Mr. Palmer as Harcourt, Mr. Dodd as Sparkish, Mr. Whitfield as Belville, Mr. Spencer as a Footman, Mr. Jones as a Countryman, Mr. Alfred as a Servant, Mrs. Jordan as Miss Piggy, Mrs. Ward as Alithia, and Mrs. Williames as Lucy.Garrick, David. \\"The Country Girl.

The church was established in 1819 by David Tenney and had 20 members, with services held in a small log cabin. In 1833, after a fire destroyed the log cabin church, a new frame church was built to replace the previous church. In 1851, a new brick church was planned and, after several difficulties, was completed in 1854. The church had two entry doors equally spaced on the front - one for women, and one for men; on the inside, there are two pairs of stairs, 4 feet wide, going up to the gallery. The church is topped by a six-sided belfry. There were three window bays on each side of the church. The first parsonage was constructed in 1857, the second one in 1906.

As he inherited his throne from his uncle (Lady An's brother-in-law) Shi Jingtang, he honored Shi Jingtang's wife Empress Li empress dowager, leaving Lady An with the lesser title of consort dowager. After Later Jin's destruction by the Khitan state Liao, she followed him into exile deep in Liao territory and died there.  Background  It is not known when Lady An was born. Little is known about her family background beyond that she was from the Daibei region (‰ª£Âåó, i.e., the region around and north of modern Xinzhou, Shanxi). Her husband Shi Jingru (Áü≥Êï¨ÂÑí)New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 17. was a cavalry officer of Li Cunxu the Prince of Jin. She gave birth to their only known child, Shi Chonggui, in 914. Shi Jingru died early, and so Shi Chonggui was raised by and adopted by his younger brother, Shi Jingtang.Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 81.  During Later Jin  In 936, Shi Jingtang, then a Later Tang general, rebelled against Later Tang's final emperor Li Congke and founded Later Jin. He, with aid from Later Tang's northern rival Khitan Empire's Emperor Taizong, then destroyed Later Tang and took over its territory.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. In 938, he created Shi Chonggui the Prince of Zheng.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. At some point (presumably around that time), Lady An was created the Lady of Qin. In 942, Shi Jingtang died. Before his death, he had intended that his only surviving son Shi Chongrui (Áü≥ÈáçÁùø) inherit the throne and had entrusted Shi Chongrui to the senior chancellor Feng Dao, but Feng, in consultation with the imperial guard general Jing Yanguang, believed that the state needed an older emperor, and therefore supported Shi Chonggui, then the Prince of Qi, to succeed Shi Jingtang. Shi Chonggui honored Shi Jingtang's wife Empress Li as empress dowager (and Shi Jingtang's mother or stepmother Empress Dowager Liu as grand empress dowager), but did not immediately honor his own mother. In 943 (by which time Grand Empress Dowager Liu had died), he honored Lady An consort dowager. It was said that Shi Chonggui served both Consort Dowager An and Empress Dowager Li diligently, often attending to their meals. What, if any, influence she had on his governance, including his subsequent renouncing of subservience to the Khitan emperor (whose state had been renamed Liao by this point), was not recorded in history.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283.  After Later Jin's destruction  In winter 946, Emperor Taizong personally led an army and, after defeating and forcing the surrender of the Later Jin general Du Wei (the husband of a sister of Shi Jingru's and Shi Jingtang's), advanced on then-Later Jin capital Kaifeng. Shi Chonggui surrendered, ending Later Jin.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. Emperor Taizong then prepared to send him and his family into exile, deep in desolate Liao proper.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. Consort Dowager An was said to be old and blind at that point, but was sent into exile with him, Empress Dowager Li, his wife Empress Feng, Shi Chongrui, and Shi Chonggui's adoptive sons (Shi Jingtang's biological grandsons) Shi Yanxu (Áü≥Âª∂ÁÖ¶) and Shi Yanbao (Áü≥Âª∂ÂØ∂). (Emperor Taizong extended Empress Dowager Li an offer not to be exiled, but she declined, choosing to share Shi Chonggui's fate; Consort Dowager An was not said to have been given such an offer.) In 949, by which time Liao was ruled by Emperor Taizong's nephew Emperor Shizong, the Shi household had settled at Liaoyang (ÈÅºÈôΩ, in modern Liaoyang, Liaoning), but was apparently separated from any ethnic Han. Empress Dowager Li decided to go meet Emperor Shizong herself, asking to be resettled near a Han city and be given land for agriculture. Emperor Shizong agreed, and decided to move them to Jian Prefecture (Âª∫Â∑û, in modern Chaoyang, Liaoning). While they were on the trek to Jian, Consort Dowager An died. As she was dying, she gave the instruction, \\"You should burn my bones and toss the ashes to the south. May it be that my spirit may return to Han lands.\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 288. However, her instructions were not completely followed. Her body was burned (but as there were not sufficient plants for firewood around, a wagon or wagons had to be dismantled to be used as fuel), and either her ashes or charred bones were taken to Jian Prefecture. After Empress Dowager Li died not long after and her body was also burned, they were buried together.

The northeastern slopes of Boulder Mountain are the origin of the Burdekin River. Downstream the river forms part of the eastern and southern boundary in four separate sections. Douglas Creek, a tributary of the Burdekin, also rises in the area. History Gugu Badhun (also known as Koko- Badun and Kokopatun) is an Australian Aboriginal language of North Queensland. The language region includes areas within the local government area of Charters Towers Region, particularly the localities of Greenvale and the Valley of Lagoons, and in the Upper Burdekin River area and in Abergowrie. Ludwig Leichhardt and his team were the first Europeans to explore the area on 4 May 1845 on his expedition from Moreton Bay to Port Essington (now Darwin). Leichhardt was very impressed with the area saying: > \\"About five miles north-west by west from our camp, we discovered an en > extensive valley with large lagoons and lakes, and a most luxuriant > vegetation, bounded by blue distant ranges, and forming the most picturesque > landscape we had yet met with. A chain of lagoons connected by a reedy brook > followed the outlines of the table land, along the foot of its steep slopes. > ... Water, grass, hills, mountains, plains, forest land; all the elements of > a fine pasturing country, were here united.\\" Leichhardt uses the term \\"valley of lagoons\\" several times in his book, presumably the origin of the name. Based on Leichhardt's favourable reports, George Elphinstone Dalrymple explored the area in 1859. Dalrymple was part of the company that established the Valley of Lagoons Station in 1862 after the area was opened up by the government. A partnership formed between Walter Jervoise Scott, his brother Arthur, Dalrymple and Robert Herbert (then Premier of Queensland) financed the acquisition of the leasehold. The partnership became Scott Bros, Dalrymple & Company with Dalrymple acting as manager.

History of the Bridge The bridge abruptly ends before it reaches the river. Beyond this point was destroyed during World War 2, and the other section was torn down by the East German government. Construction on the bridge began on August 9, 1870, with main construction taking place 1870 and 1873. A well-fortified Bridge House was located at each end of the bridge, and it had towers with battlements and embrasures on both sides of the tracks. The foundations were vaulted in casemate-like form. Allied bombing destroyed the bridge on April 20, 1945, and the division of Germany after the war made repairs impossible as the ends of the bridge were located in East Germany and West Germany. The East German government tore down what remained of the bridge on their side of the border in 1987. 550 meters (600 yards) of the bridge are still standing in the former West Germany; this portion of the bridge's arches are under historic preservation orders.
