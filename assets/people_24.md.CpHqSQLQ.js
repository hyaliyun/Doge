It is bounded by Pine Valley to the west, Wah Wah Valley to the east, the Escalante Desert to the south, and on trend with the Confusion Range to the north. The Wah Wah Mountains are located in Beaver and Millard counties. State Route 21 bisects the range, crossing over Wah Wah Summit at about above sea level. Elevations range from about at the mountain front to in the southern Wah Wahs. The \\"Wah Wah\\" name comes from Wah Wah Springs, on the eastern slope of the mountain range. \\"Wah Wah\\" is reported to mean \\"good clear water\\".Van Cott, J. W., 1990, Utah Place Names, The Bureau of Land Management, which administers most of the land within the Wah Wah Mountains, has designated two wilderness study areas, one in the north and one in the central portion of the range. Northern Wah Wah Wilderness Study Area, with Crystal Peak in the background.  Geology  The Wah Wah Mountains are made up of Neoproterozoic- to Paleozoic-aged sedimentary rocks (limestone, dolomite, shale, and sandstone metamorphized into quartzite), overlain by younger Tertiary volcanic rocks (basalt, andesite, dacite, rhyolite, and tuff) on the eastern flank of the range. A series of thrust faults cut through the sedimentary rocks in the southern end of the range. It is notable as the source of a rare red beryl gemstone, which is mined commercially. Perhaps, the most famous geologic feature is Crystal Peak, in the northern part of the range (near the pass between the Wah Wah Mountains and the Confusion Range). It is an erosional remnant of a Paleogene rhyolite tuff that has abundant doubly terminated crystals of quartz. The Wah Wah Mountains were the site of a massive supervolcano eruption 30 million years ago that ejected more than 5,900 cubic kilometers of material.

The 146th is equipped with the KC-135T Stratotanker. History =World War II= : See 345th Fighter Squadron for extended World War II history The squadron was activated on 1 October 1942 at RAF Duxford, England as the 345th Fighter Squadron. It was initially assigned to VIII Fighter Command, but was reassigned to Twelfth Air Force in December and engaged in combat in the North African Campaign and was later based in Italy as part of the Mediterranean Theater of Operations. It engaged in combat during Sicilian and Italian Campaigns. The squadron also flew combat missions from Sardinia and in the Rhone Valley of France from 1944. =Pennsylvania Air National Guard= The wartime 345th Fighter Squadron was redesignated as the 146th Fighter Squadron, and was allotted to the Pennsylvania Air National Guard on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Greater Pittsburgh Airport and was extended federal recognition on 22 April 1949. The squadron was equipped with F-47D Thunderbolts and was assigned to the 112th Fighter Group. Air Defense The 146th Fighter Squadron's mission was air defense over Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania. The unit was not activated during the Korean War. The squadron retired its F-47s in 1951 was re-equipped with long- distance F-51H Mustang interceptors, because jets which were being used by the active duty force and in Korea. After the Korean War ended, it was planned to convert the 146th Fighter-Bomber Squadron from its propeller-driven F-51Hs to F-86A Sabre jet daylight interceptors. However, after receiving four Sabres, the squadron began to receive new F-84F Thunderstreaks in October 1954. In December 1957, the 146th replaced their F-84Fs with all-weather F-86D Sabre Interceptors. F-102A 56-1361 in Vietnam War jungle camouflage motif, 1968 Beginning in 1960, Air Defense Command upgraded the 112th Fighter Interceptor Group to the supersonic F-102A Delta Dagger interceptor. Squadron pilots stood runway alert for 24 hours a day, seven days a week at the Greater Pittsburgh Airport ready to scramble regardless of the weather conditions to intercept any unidentified aircraft approaching southward from the Canada–US border or toward the United States from the Atlantic Coast. Their F-102A Delta Daggers were armed with two heat-seeking missiles and four radar-guided missiles as well as 2.75-inch rockets. Tactical Air Command A-7D 70-1017 about 1976 With air defense becoming less critical, in 1975 the 146th ended its air defense mission, receiving its first A-7D Corsair II aircraft and its mobilization gaining command changed to Tactical Air Command. The principal mission of the squadron became the destruction of targets in support of ground forces. The A-7Ds were initially received from the 354th and 355th Tactical Fighter Wings, which were being upgraded with new A-10A Thunderbolt II aircraft. Beginning in 1976 and 1977, new A-7Ds were received directly from the manufacturer, and in 1980, the squadron received some A-7K two-seat trainers. Air Refueling By the end of the 1980s the A-7Ds were being retired from the Air Force inventory, and in 1991 the 146th traded in its ground support fighters. The 112th group's gaining command became Strategic Air Command as it became a KC-135 Stratotanker air refueling squadron. The 146th has continued this mission into the present day. The tankers were operated jointly with the 147th Air Refueling Squadron at Pittsburgh. The 147th's parent unit, the 171st Air Refueling Wing, had become an air refueling organization in October 1972. Strategic Air Command was inactivated in June 1992 and the 112th Air Refueling Group became a part of the Air Combat Command (ACC). On 1 October 1993, the assets of the 112th Air Refueling Group and the 171st Air Refueling Wing at Pittsburgh were combined and the 146th Air Refueling Squadron was reassigned to the 171st Operations Group. The 112th Air Refueling Group was inactivated. With the consolidation, The 171st Air Refueling Wing had 16 aircraft assigned to two squadrons, making it one of only three \\"Super Tanker Wings\\" within the Air National Guard. Post Cold War era In May 1999, the 171st activated over 500 members and fourteen aircraft to Budapest, Hungary and Frankfurt, Germany, in support of Operation Allied Force deterring ethnic aggression in Yugoslavia. The 146th became part of the 171st Expeditionary Operations Group that flew 411 sorties and refueled 2,157 receivers. All members returned home by the beginning of July 1999. In November 2000, the 171st deployed 228 personnel to Istres AB, France in support of Operation Joint Forge, a NATO-led stabilization mission in Bosnia- Herzegovina. During this deployment the crews flew 51 sorties in seven of our KC-135s, and offloaded 1.4 million pounds of fuel. Global War on Terrorism The 171st found itself among the first units called to duty almost immediately after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York City, Washington D.C. and in its own backyard in southwestern Pennsylvania. At the time of the attacks, almost all of the wing's aircraft were in a stand-down mode, while nearly all of its assigned aircraft were being converted to with the new Pacer-Crag cockpit and navigation upgrade. Within minutes of the first aircraft crashes, the 171st Air Refueling Wing was airborne with its only flyable KC-135E. Its mission was to provide air refueling to the fuel-thirsty jet fighter aircraft that were providing Combat Air Patrol (CAP) over the skies of the eastern United States as part of Operation Noble Eagle (ONE). On the ground back in Pittsburgh, the maintainers and aircrews made more aircraft airworthy and then keeping them flying. Almost seamlessly, the 171st went into a wartime footing. Within 24 hours after the first attacks, the 171st was flying round-the-clock CAPs support sorties with eight fully mission capable KC-135s. Before the continuous CAP missions were ended in early 2002, more than 13,000 combat missions were flown over U.S. soil. During the first decade of the 2000s, the 171st was engaged in combat operations in supporting Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Noble Eagle, Operation Iraqi Freedom, deployed to Guam, participated in the Hurricane Katrina Relief Effort, supported numerous Raven assignments, supported our Air Expeditionary Force cycles and other missions. In an effort to support the international response to the unrest in Libya and enforcement of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 of a no-fly zone over Libya, the 313th Air Expeditionary Wing, with the 171st as the lead unit, was stood up in March 2011 by a blend of active duty, guard and reserve airmen. A total of 1500 sorties, 11000 flying hours, and 70 million pounds of fuel transferred aircraft from more than ten countries was accomplished by this citizen-airmen volunteer militia force. Initially, the operation for the no-fly zone was called Operation Odyssey Dawn. As it transitioned to a full-fledged, NATO-led effort, it became Operation Unified Protector. This operation officially ended 31 October 2011. =Lineage= World War II 345th Fighter Squadron emblem 146th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron – Emblem * Activated in England on 1 October 1942 by special authority granted to Eighth Air Force prior to constitution as 345th Fighter Squadron on 2 October 1942 : Inactivated on 7 November 1945 * Redesignated 146th Fighter Squadron and allotted to Pennsylvania ANG on 24 May 1946 : Extended federal recognition on 22 April 1949 : Redesignated 146th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, 1 November 1952 : Redesignated 146th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron, 1 July 1955 : Redesignated 146th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 1 July 1975 : Redesignated 146th Air Refueling Squadron, 16 October 1991 =Assignments= * 350th Fighter Group, 2 October 1942 – 7 November 1945 * 112th Fighter Group (later 112th Fighter-Bomber Group, 112th Fighter- Interceptor Group, 112th Tactical Fighter Group, 112th Air Refueling Group), 22 April 1949 * 171st Operations Group, 1 October 1993 – Present =Stations= * RAF Bushey Hall (AAF-341), England, 1 October 1942 * RAF Duxford (AAF-357), England, October 1942 * Oujda Airfield, French Morocco, 6 January 1943 * Oran Es Sénia Airport, Oran, Algeria, 14 February 1943 * Maison Blanche Airport, Algiers, Algeria, May 1943 * Rerhaia Airfield, Algeria, c. 17 July 1943 * Sardinia, 5 November 1943 * Corsica, 6 February 1944 * Tarquinia Airfield, Italy, 8 September 1944 * Pisa Airfield, Italy, 2 December 1944 – 14 July 1945 * Seymour Johnson Field, North Carolina, 25 August – 7 November 1945 * Greater Pittsburgh (later Greater Pittsburgh International) Airport, 22 April 1949 : Designated: Pittsburgh IAP Air Reserve Station after 1991 =Aircraft= * P-39 Airacobra, 1942–1944 * P-400 Airacobra, 1942–1944 * P-38 Lightning, 1943 * P-47 Thunderbolt, 1944–1945 * F-47N Thunderbolt, 1949–1951 * F-51H Mustang, 1951–1954 * F-86A Sabre, 1954 * F-84F Thunderstreak, 1954–1957 * F-86D Sabre Interceptor, 1957–1960 * F-102A Delta Dagger, 1960–1975 * A-7D Corsair II, 1975–1991 * KC-135E Stratotanker, 1991–2004 * KC-135T Stratotanker, 2004 – present References External links Category:Squadrons of the United States Air National Guard Category:Military units and formations in Pennsylvania Category:Air refueling squadrons of the United States Air Force ","title":"146th Air Refueling Squadron"},{"id":"16716431","text":"Alex Kahn (born April 9, 1967) is an American visual/performance artist and co-founder of the arts ensemble Processional Arts Workshop. He is most widely known for his creation of the large-scale puppet performance works that lead New York's Village Halloween Parade each year. Pageant puppetry and processional art Luna Moths, from Alex Kahn's Metamorphosis, from the 1998 NY Village Halloween Parade In 1998, Kahn and his partner, Sophia Michahelles, brought together an ensemble of artists, puppeteers, theatrical technicians, and performers to design the annual performances that lead New York's Village Halloween Parade. Originally named \\"Superior Concept Monsters\\", the group was incorporated as a non-profit in 2005 and renamed Processional Arts Workshop with a mission to create site-specific community-built processions, parades, and other open-space performances. These works are often developed through open community workshops that bring hundreds of volunteers together to build, rehearse, and ultimately perform cyclical pieces specifically for the parade. The performances typically incorporate elements of puppetry, sound, dance, costume/mask, lighting/projection and mobile architecture, an amalgam of mediums Kahn dubbed \\"processional art\\". In addition to leading New York's Village Halloween Parade each year, Kahn's creations have appeared in venues nationally and internationally. His work, Metamorphosis, involving 20' tall pupating luna moths, officially opened the 2000 Henson International Festival of Puppet Theatre. In 2002, he and Michahelles initiated a midsummer pageant project in the Italian Alps village of Morinesio, drawing on local folklore and oral history to create a unique site-specific pageant. Inspired by the success of the now-annual tradition, they have seeded similar projects in diverse locales in Ukraine, Turkey, Italy, Texas, New York, and elsewhere. In 2006, Kahn was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to Trinidad and Tobago, to study the artistic and cultural structures behind Caribbean Carnival and Trinidadian \\"Mas'\\", or costumed procession. More recent PAW works have included major commissions for Socrates Sculpture ParkNew York Times (8/27/2011) - \\"Odysseus Is Parading Into Queens\\" by Melena Ryzik the NY Architectural League's Beaux Arts Ball, the PEN World Voices Festival,New York Times (5/12/2014) – Johnson, Gabe. \\"Pulling Big Brother's Strings Instead\\" Houston's Buffalo Bayou Park,\\"Houston Chronicle (6/2/2015) – Want to make art for Buffalo Bayou Park's big party? the Grand Opening of the High Line over Penn Rail Yards. Other works Kahn has maintained an independent practice as a theatrical designer, printmaker, installation artist, and teacher. His interdisciplinary approach was strongly influenced by his experience as technical director of the Kitchen Performance Center during the 1990s. During this time he created lighting, objects, and effects for performance artists including John Jesurun (\\"Chang in a Void Moon\\"), Mikel Rouse (\\"Failing Kansas\\"), Roseanne Spradlin, Meredith Monk, Pauline Oliveros, and David Hykes. Kahn trained as a master printer under Robert Blackburn (artist) and chaired the Printmaking Department at Maine College of Art from 2000 to 2004. His Spam Cantos, a retooling of spam messages generated by Baysean algorithms into a series of letterpress poems, appeared at the Maine Institute of Contemporary Art in 2008. In 2016, Kahn performed in the role of \\"choir-master\\" in \\"The Visitors\\" a video-work by Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson, which has appeared at major museums around the world. His ongoing project, a fictional traveling museum called the Archive of the Synapse, has been exhibited nationally.

Personal life Brotherus was born in Skarpans in Sund, Åland while Finland was under Russian rule. He had 13 brothers and sisters of whom six died young. He took his Candidate of Philosophy degree in 1870 at Imperial Alexander University (later University of Helsinki) and began medical studies but gave them up after getting blood poisoning and became a teacher. He married Aline Mathilde Sandman (born 1853), daughter of Jonas Sandman, a Justice in the Court of Appeal, in 1879 at the age of thirty, and had four children. She died in 1894 and he did not remarry.Family Database, He taught natural history and mathematics at the Swedish girls' school in Vaasa City from 1878 to 1917, carrying on his career as a botanist in parallel. At his funeral, his grand- nephew describes: > \\"Foreign guests arrived to his funeral, he was praised in the funeral > orations, last respects were read from distant lands. The staff of the > school was astonished. They had no idea that he was also something else but > their dear old junior lecturer [original in Finnish].\\"Koponen 2005 p.348 > quoting Heikki Brotherus Biological works His earliest major work was on the moss flora of the Kola Peninsula (Brotherus and T. Saelan. 1890. Musci Lapponiae Kolaensis. Acta Societas pro Flora et Flora Fennica 6: 1-100.) His other major European work was Die Laubmoose Fennoskandias (1923). He also studied, through collections sent to him by botanists abroad, the mosses of Turkmenistan, Africa, Australia, Brazil, and New Guinea, among others, and was known as an authority on extra-European mosses. His work on the Musci of Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien covered Archidiales, Andreaeales, and Bryales, and continued to the second edition. By invitation of Heinrich von Handel-Mazzetti, he authored the section on Chinese mosses in the Symbolae Sinicae. His collaborations and correspondence with other bryologists of the day were extensive. In particular, he was well acquainted with Max Fleischer, and used Fleischer's new 'natural' system of moss classification, which was outlined in the latter's Die Musci der Flora von Buitenzorg, in his own systematic description of the mosses in Die Naturlichen Pflanzenfamilien. Brotherus's unique achievement was his synthesis of moss taxonomy for the world-wide distribution, and his mastery of the identification and classification of the estimated 20 000 species of mosses then known to him. Miscellaneous Brotherus's personal herbarium (comprising 120 000 moss specimens), in particular the extra-European collections, was purchased by the University of Helsinki herbarium (H) and is maintained as a separate collection (H-BR).Finnish Museum of Natural History http://www.fmnh.helsinki.fi/english/botany/cryptogams/index.htm Exsiccati are deposited in major herbaria around the world (e.g. B, BM, FH, K, L, P). The standard botanical abbreviation of his name is Broth. The journal Bryobrothera, published by the Finnish Bryological Society, is named in his honor. Numerous genera and species of mosses, e.g. Brothera, Brotherella, Brotherobryum, are named for him. Members of his family (see Brotherus) are still resident in Finland today.

The 147th is equipped with the KC-135T Stratotanker. History =World War II= The squadron was activated on 1 October 1942 at RAF Duxford, England by Eighth Air Force through by special authority of the Army Air Forces before it was constituted. The squadron became part of VIII Fighter Command, and drew its cadre from the 31st and 52d Fighter Groups, and Americans transferred from the Royal Air Force (RAF) who had volunteered to join the RAF prior to the United States entry into the European War, 11 December 1941. The squadron was initially equipped with an export/Lend-Lease version of P-39D Airacobra, designated Airacobra I by the RAF with additional aircraft that had been sold to France that been impounded by the British after the fall of France. These aircraft were designated as the P-400. It deployed to French Morocco, where it became part of Twelfth Air Force and engaged in combat during the North African campaign. It was briefly equipped with Lockheed P-38 Lightnings between June and September 1943. Each squadron of the 350th Fighter Group was assigned two P-38s to intercept and destroy high flying Luftwaffe reconnaissance aircraft sent to photograph the allied invasion fleet gathering along the North African coast for the Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily. The squadron re-equipped with P-47D Thunderbolts in January 1944 and engaged in combat during the Italian campaign. It also provided air cover for Allied landings on Elba in June 1944 and supported the Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France in August. The squadron then returned to Italy and fought in the Po Valley until the end of the European War in May 1945. =Pennsylvania Air National Guard= The wartime 346th Fighter Squadron was redesignated as the 147th Fighter Squadron, and was allotted to the National Guard on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Greater Pittsburgh Airport and was extended federal recognition on 22 April 1949. The squadron was equipped with Republic F-47D Thunderbolts and was assigned to the 112th Fighter Group. Air Defense The 147th Fighter Squadron's mission was air defense over Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania. It was not activated during the Korean War. The squadron retired its F-47s in 1951 was re-equipped with long-distance North American F-51H Mustang interceptors, because jets were being used by the active duty force and in Korea. After the Korean War ended the squadron began to receive new Republic F-84F Thunderstreaks in July 1955. In January 1958, the 147th replaced their F-84Fs with all-weather North American F-86L Sabre interceptors. Aeromedical airlift On 1 February 1961, the 147th expanded to a group level, and the 171st Air Transport Group was established. The 147th was transferred from the 112th Fighter-Interceptor Group to become the 171st's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 171st Material Squadron, 171st Air Base Squadron and the 171st USAF Dispensary. The 147th Aeromedical Transport Squadron converted to twin engine Fairchild C-119J Flying Boxcar aircraft and began training for its new mission of aeromedical evacuation. After two years with the C-119J, the 147th converted to the Lockheed C-121G Super Constellation. With the Super Constellation the primary mission of the 147th was military airlift, with a secondary mission of aeromedical evacuation. In 1968, the unit was redesignated the 147th Aeromedical Airlift Squadron, one of the first of its kind in the Air National Guard (ANG). Later that year, the 171st was called to active duty to augment the airlift capability of the 375th Aeromedical Airlift Wing at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. At Scott the squadron flew Convair C-131 Samaritan aircraft. Its mission was to move patients from rough combat airfield casualty staging bases and military installations in South Vietnam to destination treatment hospitals. The Group flew 35% of these missions, flying 510 sorties and airlifting 11,947 patients. The unit was finally released from active duty in December 1968 and returned to Pennsylvania control. Air refueling Conforming to the new policy of the Department of Defense, the ANG began to play an even greater role in fulfilling total U.S. force requirements. An extensive reorganization of the National Guard system was accomplished. As a result of these actions, the 171st Aeromedical Airlift Group became part of the 171st Air Refueling Wing in October 1972 and the 147th Air Refueling Squadron transitioned from the C-121G to the Boeing KC-97L Stratotanker. On 1 July 1976, the Wing received notice that Strategic Air Command (SAC) would become its new mobilization gaining command. A year later, the Wing transitioned to the Boeing KC-135A Stratotanker, a four-engine jet aircraft. This was a significant upgrade, increasing the squadron's air refueling capacity and expanding its global mission capability. In 1982, the ANG increased its mission capability through an interim program by retrofitting commercial Boeing 707 engines to their tankers redesignating the aircraft to the KC-135E. Members of the 147th volunteered for duty in Saudi Arabia in order to participate in air refueling missions for Operation Desert Shield. In December 1990 the entire unit was activated and called to federal service, an activation that lasted through May 1991. During this period over 300 members of the unit were deployed throughout the world in numerous functions supporting both Desert Shield and combat operations during Operation Desert Storm. During this period the squadron's parent wing refueled nearly 3,000 allied aircraft while stationed near the Iraqi border in support of air combat missions against Iraqi forces. Maintaining a remarkable 100% mission effectiveness rate, the 171st flew 556 combat missions and offloaded 4.6 million gallons of fuel during the 1991 Gulf War. Post Cold War era SAC was inactivated in June 1992 and Air Combat Command (ACC) became the 147th's gaining command. On 1 October 1993 the two refueling headquarters at Pittsburgh, the 112th Air Refueling Group and the 171st Air Refueling Wing, were combined and the 146th Air Refueling Squadron joined the 147th in the same group. With the consolidation, The 171st wing consisted of 16 aircraft assigned to two squadrons, making it one of only three \\"super tanker wings\\" in the Air National Guard. In May 1999, the 171st wing activated over 500 members and fourteen aircraft to Budapest, Hungary and Frankfurt, Germany, in support of Operation Allied Force deterring ethnic aggression in Yugoslavia. Deployed 147th guardsmen became part of the 171st Expeditionary Operations Group that flew 411 sorties and refueled 2,157 receivers. All members returned home by the beginning of July 1999. In November 2000, the 171st deployed 228 personnel to Istres Air Base, France in support of Operation Joint Forge, a NATO-led stabilization mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. During this deployment the crews flew 51 sorties in seven KC-135s, and offloaded 1.4 million pounds of fuel. Global War on Terrorism The 147th found itself among the first units called to duty after the September 11 attacks in New York City, Washington DC and its own backyard in southwestern Pennsylvania with the hijacking and crash of United Airlines Flight 93. At the time, almost all of the wing's aircraft were in a stand-down mode, while they were converted with the Pacer Crag cockpit and navigation upgrade. Within minutes of the first aircraft crashes, the 171st wing was airborne with its only flyable KC-135E. Its mission was to provide aerial refueling to the fuel-thirsty jet fighter aircraft that were providing Combat Air Patrols (CAPs) over the skies of the eastern United States as part of Operation Noble Eagle (ONE). On the ground back in Pittsburgh, the maintainers and aircrews made more aircraft airworthy. The unit went into a wartime footing. Within 24 hours after the first attacks, the 171st wing was flying round-the-clock CAPs support sorties with eight Fully Mission Capable KC-135s. Before the continuous CAP missions were ended in early 2002, more than 13,000 combat missions were flown over U.S. soil. During the first decade of the 2000s, the unit engaged in combat operations in supporting Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Noble Eagle, Operation Iraqi Freedom, deployed to Guam, participated in the Hurricane Katrina Relief Effort, supported numerous Raven assignments, supported our AEF cycles and other missions. In an effort to support the international response to the unrest in Libya and enforcement of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 of a no-fly zone over Libya, the 313th Air Expeditionary Wing, with the 171st wing as the lead unit, was stood up in March 2011 by a blend of active duty, guard and reserve airmen. A total of 1500 sorties, 11000 flying hours, and 70 million pounds of fuel transferred aircraft from more than ten countries was accomplished by this citizen-airmen volunteer militia force. Initially, the operation for the no-fly zone was called Operation Odyssey Dawn. As it transitioned to a full-fledged, NATO-led effort, it became Operation Unified Protector. OUP officially ended 31 October 2011.

While the site is the oldest and most important Jewish religious site in Iraq; today it forms part of the Al- Nukhailah Mosque complex.Honoring Jewish Refugees From Arab Lands: A Letter From a Forgotten Jew. Retrieved January 11, 2018. Description Jews at the tomb, 1932 According to the 8th-century rabbinical text Pirkei De-Rabbi Eliezer, Ezekiel was buried in Babylonia and mention of his tomb is first made by the 10th-century sage Sherira Gaon. Ever since, Babylonian Jews were known to have visited the tomb and only in the 12th-century did Muslims begin to associate the site with a Koranic prophet. Medieval explorer Petachiah reported in around 1180 that the Jews held the keys to the site and relates that between 60,000 to 80,000 Jews converged on the tomb during the week of Sukkot. Benjamin of Tudela mentioned several synagogues at the location and noted that Muslim notables also frequented the site to pray. In 1860, the tomb became a source of contention when Muslims attempted to wrest control of the site. The British Consul in Baghdad attempted to resolve the issue of ownership and wrote that the Jews claimed that \\"the tomb has been in their possession for upwards of 2,000 years and that their right to it has never before been questioned\\". Upon the intervention of the Anglo-Jewish Association, a government emissary from Constantinople decided in favor of the Jews. At the turn of the 20th century, the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia stated that the tomb is \\"more venerated by Jews than it is by Muhammadans.\\" Until the mid-20th century, over 5,000 Jews used to come to the tomb from Baghdad and other major cities during Passover.David M. Gitlitz & Linda Kay Davidson ‘’Pilgrimage and the Jews’’ (Westport: CT: Praeger, 2006) 96–97.Passover pilgrimage to Ezekiel's tomb in Iraq During this period, the tomb walls contained various inscriptions including three poems honouring various donors. An adjoining room contained five tombs said to belong to five Geonim. Another room was referred to as \\"Elijah's Cave,\\" and a third room contained the tombs belonging to the prominent Daniel family of Baghdad who were custodians of the site. A Hebrew plaque above the doorway dating from 1810 read \\"this is the tomb of our master Yehezkel the Prophet, son of Buzi the Kohen, may his merit shield us and all Israel. Amen.\\" After the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, the authorities redeveloped the tomb complex and converted the old synagogue courtyard into a Muslim prayer area. Some Jewish inscriptions from the tomb chamber were removed and replaced them with Koranic verses. The large new Al-Nukhailah Mosque currently encompasses the tomb structure, Muslims believing the tomb to be that of an Islamic prophet Dhul- Kifl, often identified as Ezekiel. On the walls inside Hebrew script appears under a dome with medieval Islamic floral designs.

It topped the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart on June 28, 1969, and remained there for two weeks; it was also his only Top Ten single on that chart. Rearranged by Mancini, who played the piano part himself, the song started competing with rock and roll songs from the Beatles and the Rolling Stones on an Orlando, Florida radio station and spread from there. It faced stiff opposition from some radio stations for being too soft. Those stations had to change their mind when the song became number one, ending the five-week run of \\"Get Back\\" by the Beatles as the top song. This release also topped the U.S. easy listening chart for eight weeks where it was Mancini's sole number one on the chart.

Together with his brother Fritz London he was a pioneer in the field of superconductivity.  Biography  London was born in Bonn in a liberal Jewish-German family. His father, Franz London, was professor of mathematics at the University of Bonn and his mother, Luise Burger, was the daughter of a prosperous textile manufacturer. His father died of heart failure when Heinz was nine years old. The greatest influence on Heinz's childhood was his older brother Fritz. Throughout their lives the two brothers maintained a close relationship. Heinz followed in his older brother's footsteps, studying physics, but became an experimental physicist instead and obtained his PhD under the famous superconductivity physicist Francis Simon. This connection also gave Heinz the opportunity to leave Nazi Germany. Frederick Lindemann invited Francis Simon to join the Clarendon Laboratory at the University of Oxford in 1933 supported by money obtained from chemical company ICI. When Francis Simon did he brought Heinz London as his assistant as well as Nicholas Kurti. While working in Oxford, Heinz shared a rented house with his brother Fritz and sister in-law Edith where together the brothers developed the London equations. By 1936 the money that had funded the refugee scientists had dried up and Lindemann could not find funds to offer positions to them and many others. Heinz was in a junior position without any expectation of remaining at Oxford, and so took an appointment at the University of Bristol. Fritz held out for a position at Oxford which never came and later accepted an offer by the Henri Poincaré Institute in Paris, in September 1939 moved to the Duke University After the outbreak of World War II. In 1940 Heinz was declared a civilian enemy alien and interned on the Isle of Man, but was then released to co-operate with the British nuclear program. In 1942 he obtained British citizenship. Heinz was a lifelong heavy smoker and died from lung cancer in 1970. He was an atheist. Education Heinz studied at the University of Bonn in 1926/27, after he attended an internship for six months at a chemical plant for Heraeus in Hanau, Germany. In 1929 he spent a year of study at the Technical University Berlin-Charlottenburg (now the Technical University of Berlin ) and then at the University of Munich. In 1931 obtained his PhD under the famous low temperature physicist Franz Simon in Breslau. Career London worked with his brother Fritz London on superconductivity, discovering the London equations when working at the University of Oxford, in the Clarendon Laboratory. These equations gave a first explanation to the Meissner effect (and, so, to the properties of superconductors). He is known as well for being the inventor of the dilution refrigerator, a cryogenic device that uses liquid helium.

The castle keep, or tenshu, was rebuilt in 1985 out of wood, and was based on pictures of other castles of the era. It houses a museum that has items pertaining to the castle's history.

Design The Picchio was developed in Italy in the late 1950s as a further development of Stelio Frati's Falco and Nibbio designs. Like its predecessors, the Picchio was a conventional low-wing cantilever monoplane of exceptionally clean lines, with retractable tricycle undercarriage. Early versions of the Picchio shared the same wooden construction as the earlier designs, but had a thin aluminium skin over the top of their plywood skins. The F.15E and F.15F, however, were all-metal. Production Production of the early, wooden Picchios was carried out by Procaer in Milan, but in the mid 1960s, Frati established General Avia as his own factory to build his designs, commencing with the F.15E. Only a few examples were built, however, and the design lay dormant until revived by an Austrian company, HOAC in the mid 1990s. HOAC arranged to have the two-seat F.15F model built at the JSC Sokol plant in Niznij Novgorod, but ran out of money, leaving Sokol with unsold airframes in various states of completion. Operational history The Picchio was primarily intended for operation by private pilot owners and the design was exported to several European countries as well as being purchased by Italian individuals. Several are still airworthy (2012). Variants * F.15 - prototype with Lycoming O-320 engine and three seats (1 built) * F.15A - initial production version with Lycoming O-360 engine and four seats (10 built by Procaer) Procaer F.15B Picchio at Milan Linate Airport in 1965 * F.15B - similar to F.15A but with larger-span wings and fuel tanks relocated from fuselage to wings (20 built by Procaer) * F.15C - version with Continental IO-470 engine and tip tanks (1 built) * F.15D - proposed version similar to F.15B with Franklin engine (not built) * F.15E Picchio - Four-seat, all metal aircraft with fuel in wing and wing-tip tanks and powered by Continental IO-520K engine. First prototype flown 21 December 1968 and second aircraft flown 1976. * F.15F - All metal, four-seat derivative of F15.E with bubble canopy and powered by IO-360 engine.

Chubb was the first chair of the new Department of Political Science at Trinity College, Dublin, and was responsible for numerous publications which became standard works for those wishing to gain insight into Irish government and politics, most notably his The Government and Politics of Ireland, which was published in four editions. He was described as the \\"Father of political science in Ireland\\" and the \\"virtual inventor of Irish political science\\". Early life, military service and education Basil Chubb was born in Branksome, Poole, Dorset, the second eldest of five children. The family moved to Ludgershall, Wiltshire when he was still a child and he attended Bishop Wordsworth's School. He attended Merton College, Oxford, but his education was interrupted by the onset of World War II. He joined the RAF, but was shot down and captured during a bombing raid over Leipzig on 19 February 1944. He spent 15 months as a prisoner at Stalag Luft III, a German air force prisoner of war camp which is best known for two escapes which took place there. Basil was not one of the escapers, although he had to witness the repercussions of the various escape efforts once discovered. Before joining the RAF, Basil had met Margaret (Margot) Rafther at Oxford, and she sent him letters and books via the Red Cross to enable him to continue his studies whilst prisoner. They would marry in 1946, following the end of the war. Also in that year, he completed his first degree in Modern History at Oxford, with a Masters from Trinity College, Dublin, Doctorate from Oxford and Doctor of Letters from Trinity College, Dublin to follow. Chubb and Rafther were friends with George Orwell. Chubb became an Irish citizen in the early 1970s. Career His first appointment was as Political Science Lecturer at Trinity College, Dublin. This was the first full-time appointment in political science at a time when Irish politics were not openly discussed. When the department of Political Science was founded in 1960 at TCD, Basil Chubb became its first chair, a post which he held until his retirement in 1991. During his career, he produced a number of texts, including The Government and Politics of Ireland, which the Irish Times described as \\"the secular equivalent of an Irish political bible\\". He also held a number of public office posts, including chair of the Employer Labour conference (which played a crucial role in national economic policy) and chair of Comhairle na Ospidal (the Hospitals Council) from 1972 to 1979. He was a frequent broadcaster in the coverage of Irish political campaigns and helped demystify the topic for the general public through his television appearances during the Irish elections.

Arts and literature The unofficial art mouvement of Fauvism (Fauves is the French word for \\"wild beasts\\"). Henri Matisse (1869-1954) was the leader of the small group, with other major artists including André Derain (1880-1954) and maurice de Vlaminick (1876-1958). The mouvement was never made official with documents signed by members of a list of criteria in order for work to be considered Fauvism, but it was simply a small group of mainly French painters who used brilliant colour and unexpected brushstrokes, similar to the German Expressionism mouvement. Matisse created the Fauve style after experimenting with post-impressionistic painters, such as Gauguin, Cézanne and Van Gogh, as well as the Neo-impressionism of Cross, Signac and Seurat. All these painters inspired Matisse to reject 3D uses of spaces and use colour and mouvement to create 2D planes of space.

However, the unit was first formed about a week earlier when some Air Service recruits arrived at Kelly but remained an un-designated organization. The men were placed into basic indoctrination training, with drill, fatigue duty, classroom training, and other things that are done in military training camps. During its time at Kelly Field, men were transferred in and out of the squadron, depending on their qualifications and the needs of other units in training. Once basic indoctrination training was completed, the 118th was ordered for overseas duty, being ordered to report to the Aviation Concentration Center, Garden City, Long Island on 4 November.

Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917–1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. At Garden City, the squadron was assigned to \\"Provisional Wing #2\\", which consisted of the 106th, 107th, 108th, 109th and 116th Aero Squadrons. On 7 December 1917, the wing boarded a train at Garden City, and went northwards to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where it arrived on 12 December. The squadrons boarded the RMS Tunican and began its trans-Atlantic sailing, arriving at Liverpool, England on 26 December. It was snowing when the squadron arrived in England, and the men loaded onto a train, heading south through a blizzard, arriving at Southampton. There the men marched though the snow to a rest camp. On the 29th, the squadron crossed the English Channel, arriving in Le Havre, France later that day, marching in about a foot of snow to another rest camp. The squadron then traveled by train to the Replacement Concentration Center, AEF, St. Maixent Replacement Barracks, France, arriving on 2 January 1918. At St. Maixent the Provisional Wing was dissolved and the men put into barracks out of the snow with plenty of hot coffee. The 106th remained at St. Maixent until 26 February, its designation being changed to the 800th Aero Squadron. 800th Aero Squadron – Headquarters Flight \\"A\\" 5th Aerial Artillery Observation School. 800th Aero Squadron – Flight B, 1st Aerial Artillery Observation School (1st AAOS). 800th Aero Squadron – Flight C, 5th Aerial Artillery Observation School (5th AAOS). On 26 February, the 800th Aero Squadron was divided into three flights, each of which would be able to function as an individual unit in the repair and upkeep of airplanes and engines. : Headquarters, Flight \\"A\\" was dispatched to the 5th Aerial Artillery Observation School (2d AAOS), Camp de Souge, Base Section No. 2, Bordeaux. : Flight \\"B\\" was dispatched to the 1st Aerial Artillery Observation School (1st AAOS), Camp Coëtquidan (Camp de Coëtquidan) a French military educational facility located in Guer, Morbihan département, in Brittany. : Flight \\"C\\" was dispatched to the 5th Aerial Artillery Observation School (5th AAOS), Camp La Valdehon, Doubs. An effort was made to have each of the flights as nearly equal in skilled mechanics and other trained personnel as far as possible, each flight consisting of about 50 men. At this point, the history of the squadron may be said to be a combination of each of these separate flights. Headquarters Flight \\"A\\" arrived at Bordeaux on 28 February and were taken to some brick barracks. The flight learned they would be the entire enlisted personnel of the 2d AAOS. The camp was policed from the entrance to the camp to the flying field, with weeds and underbrush cut to make the field usable for airplanes. A program of camp sanitation was begun and the men of the squadron performed many duties, from furnishing electrical power to the buildings as well as supplying the goods and services necessary for the operation of the school. The camp had the appearance of a well-kept US Army Post in the United States. In March, the first airplanes arrived at the school, Sopwith 1A2s. In September, ten Curtiss JN-4 trainers arrived from the United States, the JN-4s being the only ones in France. Some Dayton-Wright DH-4s arrived in early November from the Air Service Production Center No. 2, Romorantin Aerodrome. Flight \\"B\\" of the squadron was moved to Camp de Souge on 30 October and consolidated with Headquarters, Flight \\"A\\". Flight \\"B\\" of the 800th Aero Squadron arrived at the 1st AAOS in Coëtquidan on 1 March 1918. Coëtquidan was, in fact, one of the largest artillery camps since the time of Napoleon and had recently been turned over to the United States Army. Some Americans had already arrived and assembled six ancient French planes, the men having completed courses of instruction at the Renault, Loraine, Dietrich, Farman and Breguet engine factories. The school was supplied with new aircraft, primarily SPAD observation planes from Romorantin Aerodrome. At the end of October, the flight was relieved from Coëtquidan and transferred to Bordeaux where it rejoined Headquarters, Flight \\"A\\". Flight \\"C\\" of the 800th arrived at Le Valdahon, Doubs on 3 March. The men found the camp knee-deep in mud and still growing deeper. The men were taken to the Headquarters, 17th Field Artillery where they received a warm resection with warm meals and some comfortable quarters. The aviation camp, where the 5th AAOS was to be operated, however, had been unoccupied for months, and was in a severely dilapidated state. To make it even a half-way decent place seemed a hopeless task. However, orders were received to do so and construction materiel was received to put the camp into a serviceable condition. The barracks were overhauled, a kitchen built along with a mess hall. Men without carpentry or other construction skills were put into building serviceable streets and also erecting some hangars and cleaning up the airfield. On 21 April, the first Sopwith airplanes arrived from Tours Aerodrome. As time passed, additional facilities were built and conditions improved, to the point of building tennis courts in August. With the Armistice with Germany in November 1918, the 800th Aero Squadron was still divided at both locations, both remaining in France until well into 1919. Flights \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" returned home to the United States in May, while Flight \\"C\\" did not return until July 1919. They arrived at Mitchel Field, New York, where the squadron members were demobilized and returned to civilian life.Order of Battle of the United States Land Forces in the First World War, Volume 3, Part 3, Center of Military History, United States Army, 1949 (1988 Reprint) Many additional World War I squadron photographs are available by clicking the Wikipedia Commons link to the right. =Alabama National Guard= 106th Observation Squadron Curtiss JN-6H 106th Observation Squadron Douglas O-38s On 21 January 1922 the 125th Squadron, Alabama National Guard, received federal recognition as a Corps Aviation unit. (It was re-designated the 135th Observation Squadron on 25 January 1923 and then it was re-designated the 114th Observation Squadron as an aviation unit the 39th Division on 1 May 1923. On 16 January 1924, it was re-designated the 106th Observation Squadron as an aviation unit in the 31st Division.) Maj. James A. Meissner, a World War I ace who had flown with Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker, led the effort to form the unit and served as its first commander. The early years were challenging. Land was donated for what would become Roberts Field. Steel was salvaged from old wartime hangars to build new hangars. Birmingham citizens donated money to defray construction expenses. Squadron members even returned their pay to the squadron to defray costs and supplied much of the labor themselves. In the first few years of operation, while constructing the facilities at Roberts Field, the Squadron participated in mine rescue work, began a program of providing aerial photographs of points of industrial and historical interest throughout Alabama, and provided the first Air Mail service in the State of Alabama. By 1929, the Squadron had transitioned from Major Meissner to W.V.M. Robertson, Jr., and then to Lt. Col. Sumpter Smith. Under the command of Lt. Col. Smith in 1929, the Squadron rendered its \\"greatest service to the State of Alabama\\" when the entire Squadron was ordered to active duty for flood relief in south Alabama. Twenty- five officers and 100 men participated for 14 days and nights, flying a total of approximately 300 hours dropping food and medicine to marooned families. The airdrop of supplies was among the first of its kind in aviation history. By 1930, the facilities at Roberts Field were long-since declared inadequate by numerous inspectors, but the Squadron did not have the funds to move. A steady campaign of publicity and pressure on legislative and local government was maintained until the decision was made to build new facilities for the 106th Observation Squadron at the Birmingham Municipal Airport as part of the government works project in 1934. When Colonel Smith moved up to the 31st Division, command of the Squadron passed to Henry Badham, Jr., one of the founding members of the Birmingham Flying Club. On 16 January 1936, James Meissner, the father of the Alabama Air National Guard, died from pneumonia. The city held a memorial service involving a flyover by the planes of the unit he founded and his old friend and former World War I wingman, Eddie Rickenbacker, returned to Birmingham to be an honorary pall-bearer. Major Meissner is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. In 1936, the 106 Aero Squadron was consolidated with the 106th Observation Squadron of the Alabama National Guard. It took nearly four years to complete the construction of the new home of the 106th Observation Squadron at the Birmingham Municipal Airport, but in 1938 the Squadron was finally able to move into its new quarters. Eventually, the base was named after the colonel who helped ensure its construction, Colonel Sumpter Smith. =World War II= The 106th was ordered to active duty on 25 November 1940 as part of the buildup of the Army Air Corps after the Fall of France. Ordered to the 36th Street Airport, Miami, Florida after the Pearl Harbor Attack in mid-December 1941, the Guardsmen flew antisubmarine patrols over the Florida Atlantic coast until September 1942, also operating from Jacksonville and Savannah, Georgia. Transferred to Third Air Force and moved to Tennessee in late 1942, the 106th began training for combat observation and liaison duties then as a medium bombardment squadron flying the B-25 Mitchell. This new mission was reflected in a name change when the 106 Observation Squadron was re-designated 106 Reconnaissance Squadron (Bombardment) on 2 April 1943. In late 1943, the 106th was deployed to the South Pacific Area (SPA) and arrived at Guadalcanal on 15 November 1943, the 106th immediately began performing its new bombing mission. In the Pacific Theater, the squadron engaged enemy forces in New Guinea; the Northern Solomon Islands; Bismarck Archipelago; on Leyte, Luzon and Mindanao in the Philippine Campaign, and also in southeast China. At the end of the war, the 100th Bombardment Squadron (Medium), the final wartime designation of the squadron, was inactivated in the Philippines on 11 December 1945. For its combat service in the South Pacific, the 100th Bombardment Squadron was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation: Balikpapan, Borneo, 23–30 Jun 1945, and the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation. =Alabama Air National Guard= The wartime 100th Bombardment Squadron was re-activated and re-designated as the 106th Bombardment Squadron (Light) and was allotted to the Alabama Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Birmingham Municipal Airport and was extended federal recognition on 25 November 1946. The 106th Bombardment Squadron was bestowed the history, honors, and colors of the 100th Bombardment Squadron and its predecessor units. The squadron was equipped with B-26C Invader light bombers and was assigned to the 54th Fighter Wing, Georgia ANG for administration, while being under the operational control of the Alabama Air National Guard. The 106th Bombardment Squadron practiced formation bombing as well as low-level intrusion and strafing. Parts for the B-26s were no problem with the massive amount of supplies still stored in wartime warehouses, and many of the maintenance personnel were World War II veterans so readiness was quite high and the planes were often much better maintained than their USAF counterparts. On 1 October 1947 the squadron came under the control of the new 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Group at Birmingham, and in 1950, the B-26 Invader light bombers were exchanged for RB-26C Invader reconnaissance aircraft which were unarmed and carried cameras and flash flares for night photography. During the Korean War, the 106th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron (Night Photo) was federalized and assigned to the Ninth Air Force 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Group at Shaw AFB, South Carolina. It moved to Shaw on 5 January 1952 where it replaced the 162d Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron which was deployed to Itazuke AB, Japan to fly photo-reconnaissance missions over Korea. At Shaw, it joined the 16th and 18th TRS flying night reconnaissance training missions with the RB-26C. Many of the squadron's pilots were deployed to Japan and South Korea where they served in combat, flying hazardous unarmed night reconnaissance missions over enemy-held territory. On 1 January 1953 the 106th was returned to Alabama state control and returned to Birmingham. The squadron continued to fly the RB-26C until 1957 when the aircraft was reaching its end of operational service and was retired. Replacing the Invader in May 1957 were new RF-84F Thunderstreak jet reconnaissance aircraft, manufactured by Republic for Air National Guard service. The squadron continued to train in tactical reconnaissance missions throughout the 1950s with the Thunderstreaks. 1961 Berlin Crisis The squadron was federalized a second time on 1 October 1961 as a result of the 1961 Berlin Crisis. The 117th TRG was again federalized, which consisted of the 160th TRS from Montgomery; the 106th TRS at Birmingham; the 153d Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron (Mississippi ANG), and the 184th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron (Arizona ANG). Due to federal budget restrictions, only the 106th TRS was deployed to Dreux-Louvilliers AB, France, however, elements of all three other squadrons rotated to France as part of the USAFE 7117th Tactical Wing over the next year and 106th pilots returned to the United States. On 27 October twenty 106th TRS RF-84F's were deployed to Dreux, arriving on 3 November. In addition, two T-33A Shooting Star jet trainers and one C-47 Skytrain were deployed as support aircraft. By 22 November, the wing reassembled at the newly reactivated Dreux for an estimated stay of ten months. However, problems developed immediately after their arrival at Dreux. The base had been in standby status for about a year and no longer was used for operational flights. Possibly the French forgot to take into account the fact that the base could be re-opened for exercises and deployments such as was now the case. In any event, the more than one thousand airmen of the 106th TRS arrived at a base that had been stripped clean. The French had taken away office desks, telephones and typewriters. The kitchens had not been used for some time, a fact that the quartermasters had not taken into account, so getting the base operational again in the short time available took an all-out effort. A few days after the ground units arrived from Alabama, the first aircraft were prepared for a practice flight. The French Air Traffic Controllers, however, refused permission for take-off. Only after a lot of negotiation were several aircraft allowed to take to the air. Dreux AB came within the Paris Air Traffic Control area, as did the busy Le Bourget Airport and Orly Airports, and an extra squadron of jet aircraft had not been allowed in the French air traffic controllers' staffing levels. The safety of civilian air traffic was used to justify denying the Americans permission to fly out of Dreux AB. Notwithstanding stormy protests by the United States, every form of co-operation was refused and the RF-84s stayed on the ground. The pilots who had only just completed a risky Atlantic crossing of several thousand kilometers, had to wait in the operations room. In the United States, the Birmingham News daily newspaper reported that 'their boys', after the sudden mobilization and the weeks of preparation, had not been sent to Europe to sit around a French airfield doing nothing. However, as strongly the Pentagon protested, the French answer remained 'non!'. Eventually, General Reid Doster, commander of the Alabama deployment could do little else but take his aircraft elsewhere. At the end of November 1961 he received permission from the French traffic controllers to go with his aircraft to Chaumont- Semoutiers AB, another USAFE-controlled base in France. Permission was received from the French to move the 7117th TRW on 8 December 1961, however HQ USAFE insisted that the 7117th Wing HQ remain at Dreux AB for airlift traffic. Thus the 106th TRS operated from Chaumont AB, while Wing HQ remained at Dreux. On 22 July 1962 the 106th TRS returned to Alabama leaving its F-84Fs in France. Dreux AB was placed back in standby status by USAFE, and never really used again until it was turned over to the French in 1966. Vietnam and late Cold War era Republic RF-84F-30-RE Thunderflash of the 106th TRS, Alabama Air National Guard, 52-7425 After the squadron re-formed in Birmingham, the 106th TRS was again re-equipped with RF-84Fs from active-duty squadrons that were receiving the McDonnell RF-101 Voodoo. It continued to fly the Thunderstreak reconnaissance aircraft throughout the 1960s. As the RF-84F was not used during the Vietnam War, the 117th TRG was not activated for duty in Southeast Asia, although some pilots from the 106th went through transition training to the RF-101C and RF-4C and were deployed for combat duty. 106th TRS RF-4C 66-7761 about 1972, shortly after its transfer from the 432d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, Udorn RTAFB, Thailand. In November 1971 the Thundersteaks were retired as they reached the end of their service life and the 117th TRG was chosen to be the first Air National Guard squadron to receive the RF-4C Phantom II tactical reconnaissance aircraft. The squadron received aircraft directly being withdrawn from Southeast Asia as part of the United States pullout from the Vietnam War. 106th TRS RF-4C Phantom II aircraft at Ramstein AB, West Germany, March 1976.

Aircraft retired in 1993, now on static display at Jasper, AL VFW post. At Nellis AFB, sixty-seven members of the 106th TRS obtained realistic combat training against the 64th Tactical Fighter Training Aggressor Squadron, equipped with F-5E Tiger II aggressor aircraft which simulated Soviet Air Force MiG-21 air defense fighters. Many awards were earned by the 117th; for having the best National Guard Publication; for achieving flying milestones; for service to the United States Secret Service; and for outstanding accomplishments on Operational Readiness Inspections. The 117th also earned awards for having the best ANG flying unit in the United States. Operation Desert Shield 106th TRS RF-4C Phantom II 64-1047, shown at Shaikh Isa Air Base, Bahrain during Operation Desert Shield. Note the numerous \\"camels\\", painted on its intake, representing the number of missions flown. 1047 Flew 172 sorties in Desert Shield. After its retirement in May 1994, the aircraft was flown to Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio where today it is on permanent display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force. It had more than 7,300 hours of flying time. By early 1989, the operational lifetime of the F-4 Phantom was ending, and the number of RF-4C squadrons serving both on active-duty as well as in Air National Guard units was being reduced. In large part, the RF-4C was being replaced by the ability of the Lockheed U-2 TR-1A and TR-1B variant, which had taken over the tactical reconnaissance mission. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact led to accelerated retirement plans, and the retirement of the last of the RF-4Cs was in the planning stages when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, and further inactivation plans were put on hold. Consequently, the RF-4C was still in service with the USAF at the time of Operation Desert Shield. When the United States military build-up in the Middle East began following Saddam Hussein's 2 August 1990 invasion of Kuwait, six RF-4Cs of the 117th TRW equipped with a camera upgrade called the HIAC-1 LOROP (Long Range Oblique Photography) deployed on 24 August 1990 to Al Dhafra Air Base, United Arab Emirates. Their journey to the war zone may have been the longest nonstop flight made by operational warplanes at that time, requiring 16 air-to-air refuelings and spanning 8,000 nautical miles in 15.5 hours. Initially assigned to HQ United States Central Command Air Forces, the 106th TRS was later further assigned to the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing (Provisional). LOROP was capable of high-resolution images of objects 100 miles away using a high-resolution 66-inch focal length camera that was carried in a centerline pod underneath the aircraft. It was used to conduct prewar surveillance and photo-reconnaissance mapping of Iraqi forces in occupied Kuwait as well as those deployed along the Saudi Arabia-Iraq border. In support of RF-4C operations, numerous airmen and aircraft were used, among them C-21 Learjets, to move finished imagery around the theater. In the Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia known as the \\"Black Hole,\\" coalition air commander Lt. Gen. (later Gen.) Charles \\"Chuck\\" Horner scrutinized the RF-4C images of Iraq's forces every day. Unfortunately, 64-1044 crewed by Major Barry K. Henderson and Lt. Col. Stephen G. Schraam was lost in an operational accident on 8 October 1990. The 106th TRS, however, did not engage in combat operations during Operation Desert Storm, being relieved on 18 December 1990 by the 192d Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron of the Nevada ANG. Later, RF-4Cs taken from the USAF's 12th TRS/67th TRW and the 38th TRS/26th TRW were deployed and were engaged in combat during Desert Storm. Air Refueling 106th Air Refueling Squadron KC-135 Stratotanker After the end of Desert Storm, the phaseout of the RF-4C with the ANG was accelerated. On 16 March 1992 the 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing adopted the USAF \\"objective wing\\" and was re-designated the 117th Reconnaissance Wing; on 1 June 1992 Tactical Air Command was inactivated, being replaced by the new Air Combat Command (ACC). During 1994 the RF-4Cs were sent to Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona for retirement at AMARC. On 1 October the 117th Reconnaissance Wing was re-designated as the 117th Air Refueling Wing, the mission now becoming aerial refueling with KC-135 Stratotankers, the first tanker arriving later that month. After the 9/11 attacks on the United States, the 117th ARW was deployed to MacDill AFB, Florida and began refueling F-15 and F-16 aircraft flying Combat Air Patrol missions over major cities in the Southeastern United States as part of Operation Noble Eagle. In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended closing the 117th ARW and reassigning its aircraft to other National Guard units. This decision was ultimately reversed. =Lineage= Patch from the 106th Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron.

Life The youngest son of the hon. Sir Alexander Maitland and Penelope, daughter of Colonel Martin Madan and Judith Madan the poet, he was also the grandson of Charles Maitland, 6th Earl of Lauderdale and a first cousin of Rear Admiral Frederick Lewis Maitland (1779–1837). In 1779, the age of sixteen, Maitland joined the 14th regiment, serving as a Marine on HMS Union at the Great Siege of Gibraltar in 1781. He subsequently served in the West Indies on the staff of the quarter master-general, General Cuyler. He was promoted from Ensign to Brevet Major and also served as aide-de-camp to Sir Charles Grey at the relief of Nieuport on the Dutch coast in 1793. Maitland was engaged in two naval actions during this period; the first in 1793 involving the sloop Fairy (18 guns, commanded by Captain later Admiral John Laforey), in which Maitland commanded the Marines, in an engagement with a French 32-gun frigate, which escaped. The second, in 1797, involved the frigate Arethusa (38 guns, commanded by Captain Woolley), and Maitland commanded the cabin guns of the frigate at the capture of the French corvette, La Gaieté. In 1796 Maitland was appointed secretary to General Sir Ralph Abercromby and travelled with him to the West Indies. While serving in Martinique, he was instrumental in the bloodless resolution of the rebellion of Jean Kina and later argued against punishment for any of Kina's men. Maitland was appointed quartermaster general in the West Indies in 1800, with the rank of Colonel. He commanded a brigade at the capture of St Bartholemew, St Thomas, St Martin, and Santa Cruz in 1801. He was also second in command at the taking of Surinam in 1804. In 1805 Maitland was appointed Governor of Grenada at the express command of George III. In 1807 he saw further action during the recapture of St Thomas and Santa Cruz which had been returned after the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. Coincidentally, Maitland received the surrender of St Thomas from Van Schogen, the same Dutch Governor he had captured the island from in 1801. In 1809 he commanded a brigade during the Invasion of Martinique. In recognition of his services, Maitland was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Dominica. He married Catherine, daughter of John Prettyjohn of Barbados. They had nine children, but only three survived him. These were Harriet (b. 1801 d. 1850), who married Donald Maclean, Colonel Frederick Thomas Maitland (b. 1807 d. 1882), and Charlotte Garth (b. 1799 d. 1868), who married Captain Thomas Garth RN of Haines Hill in Berkshire. Maitland died at Tunbridge Wells on 27 January 1848.

A MEPS is usually made mandatory by a government energy efficiency body. It may include requirements not directly related to energy; this is to ensure that general performance and user satisfaction are not adversely affected by increasing energy efficiency. A MEPS generally requires use of a particular test procedure that specifies how performance is measured. In North America when addressing energy efficiency, a MEPS is sometimes referred to simply as a \\"standard\\", as in \\"Co-operation on Labeling and Standards Programs\\". In Latin America when addressing energy efficiency, MEPS are sometimes referred to as Normas (translated as \\"norms\\"). Examples * A refrigerating appliance is required to maintain temperatures inside its compartments within specified limits, and to operate (including defrosting) in a specified ambient temperature while using at most a specified amount of electricity; the energy use allowed varies according to volume, number of doors, the function of the various compartments and other parameters. This graph shows the dramatic reduction in electricity use in U.S. refrigerators following the introduction of a series of first California then U.S. MEPS starting in the mid-1970s: Price, volume and efficiency of refrigerators * An electric fan is required to shift air at a specified rate while consuming a limited amount of power. A storage water heater providing hot water for sanitary purposes is required to heat up a specified quantity of water to a specified temperature and store it at that temperature for a specified time while consuming a limited amount of energy. In this example, the requirements for heating up and for maintaining the temperature may be applied as two separate energy performance requirements or there may be a single task efficiency. * An electric induction motor is required to have a specified minimum full-load efficiency. A compact fluorescent lamp is required to start and run up to near full brightness in a given time, to have a minimum life of several thousand hours, to maintain its output within specified limits, to withstand a certain number of switchings, to have a consistent colour appearance and a specified colour rendering. Its energy performance requirement is usually stated in terms of minimum efficacy (light output per electrical input). California In the U.S., the state of California was a pioneer http://www.eceee.org S. Nadel S., 2003, Appliance & equipment efficiency standards in the US: Accomplishments,next steps and lessons learned, ECEEE 2003 Summer Study, St Raphael. in the introduction of MEPS. In order to reduce the growth in electricity use, the California Energy Commission (CEC) was given unique and strong authority to regulate the efficiency of appliances sold in the state. It started to adopt appliance efficiency regulations in 1978, and has updated the standards regularly over time, and expanded the list of covered appliances. In 1988, California's standards became national standards for the U.S. through the enactment of the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA). The federal standards preempted state standards (unless the state justified a waiver from federal preemption based on conditions in the state), and since then, the U.S. Department of Energy has had the responsibility to update the federal standards. California has continued to expand the list of appliances it regulates for appliances that are not federally regulated, and therefore not preempted. In recent years, the CEC's attention has been focused on consumer electronics, for which energy use has been growing dramatically. Australia MEPS programs are made mandatory in Australia by state government legislation and regulations which give force to the relevant Australian Standards.

New Zealand On 5 February 2002, New Zealand introduced Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) with Energy Efficiency Regulations. MEPS and energy rating labels help improve the energy efficiency of our products, and enable consumers to choose products that use less energy. Products covered by MEPS must meet or exceed set levels for energy performance before they can be sold to consumers. MEPS have been updated over the years (2002, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2011) to cover a wide range of products, and increasing levels of stringency. New Zealand works with Australia to harmonise MEPS levels.

United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (March 6, 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.  Background  In Chile education is universal, compulsory, and free from first through 12th grade. The latest government figures showed that in 2002 the median level of education was 10 years but varied regionally and across age groups. The World Bank reported that in 2004 more than 90 percent of school-age children attended school. Three-quarters of the population had completed primary education (eight years), and 61 percent had secondary education (12 years). The government provides basic health care through a public system, which included regular checkups, vaccinations, and emergency health care. Boys and girls had equal access to health care. Violence against children has been a problem in Chile. A 2003 study by the Citizens' Peace Foundation indicated that 60 percent of children surveyed between the ages of seven and 10 had suffered some type of aggression against them or their belongings either inside or outside their homes. A 2006 UNICEF study reported that 75 percent of 13- and 14-year-olds reported they were subject to some type of physical or psychological violence from one or both parents, including 26 percent who reported having suffered serious physical violence (e.g., beatings, cuts, and burns). From January to November, the Public Ministry reported 197 cases of commercial juvenile sexual exploitation, compared with 195 cases in all of 2005. Since June 2003 the government's National Children's Service (SENAME) assisted more than 2,100 victims of commercial juvenile sexual exploitation. SENAME, the Carabineros, and PICH worked together, along with schools and NGOs, to identify children in abusive situations, provide abused children with counseling and other social services, and keep families intact. Child prostitution in Chile has been a problem, as well as child labor in the informal economy.

Transparency International's 2016 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 24th place out of 176 countries.  Corruption in Chile  In December 2005 the mayor of Quillota, Luis Mella (Christian Democrat), alleged the government's Job-Making Program (PGE) paid political allies for work that was not performed. The Public Ministry and the comptroller then initiated parallel investigations into the potential illicit use of public funds. Although earmarked for employment programs, these resources were possibly diverted to the political campaigns of Socialist Party and Party for Democracy candidates in the Fifth Region during the 2005 congressional elections. The PGE investigations revealed that individuals paid to do public works actually spent their time campaigning for political parties.Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Chile. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (March 6, 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Further investigations revealed that funds were also misused in other Fifth Region counties. Many midlevel public officials in the regional government, such as the former regional ministerial secretary of labor, were formally investigated, and several local officials were removed. The government took remedial steps to control public employment programs, dismantling the PGE and designating three government agencies to manage recruitment of public works employers and workers and payment of wages. In October a government audit revealed financial irregularities in Chiledeportes, a national program to promote amateur and professional sport activities. Opposition political figures charged that the funds had been diverted into the national political campaigns of ruling party figures, while the organization's director characterized the issue as \\"common crime.\\" The government removed all 13 Chiledeportes regional directors and initiated a broad-based investigation to determine the extent and nature of potential fraud or mismanagement. Congress created an investigative committee in February, and prosecutors brought charges of tax evasion and falsification of documents against some individuals. Executive, congressional, and judicial investigations were ongoing at year's end. The Freedom of Information Act requires the government and its agencies to make all unclassified information about their activities available to the public. All government ministries and most public agencies have Web pages. In 2005 the NGO Participa released the results of a far- ranging survey, which found that national and local government agencies failed to respond to 69 percent of requests for information and provided incomplete or otherwise deficient responses to 14 percent of requests. 2006–2007 Chilean corruption scandals The 2006–2007 Chilean corruption scandals were a series of events that have affected the Chilean governing Concertación coalition in 2006 and 2007. = Chiledeportes = In October 2006, it was discovered that 90% of the projects of Chiledeportes, the government's sports organization, had some sort of anomaly: either initiatives that were never started or false and nonexistent identities. The investigation into this mystery led to the arrest of Juan Michel, a prominent member of the Christian Democrat Party. Later, it was discovered that much of the money that went to Chiledeportes' Valparaíso Region branch was used to finance the political campaigns of Concertación members, mainly those of Party for Democracy deputies and Rodrigo González Torres. Twenty people were arrested because of this misuse of government funds. = Publicam = The crisis continued when it was discovered that Senator Guido Girardi, of the Party for Democracy, had used false bills from a nonexistent company, Publicam, in order to justify his campaign expenses to the Servicio de Impuestos Internos (Internal Tax Service). Some of the members of Girardi's campaign team, among them his lawyer, Dante Leoz, were arrested and accused of financial fraud. Girardi himself is currently under investigation, but there have been no charges. He has denied charges of corruption, but admits that he should have studied his campaign expenses more carefully. Senator Fernando Flores, who leads the more liberal faction of the Party for Democracy, temporarily suspended his membership of the party, saying that it was ruled by a corrupt \\"gang\\". He later decided to rejoin, but in 2007 he resigned from the party permanently (see below). The right-wing opposition (the Alliance for Chile) likened the Chiledeportes and Publicam cases to previous corruption scandals that took place during the administration of Ricardo Lagos. Former presidential candidate Sebastián Piñera (which later also was found linked to Publicam) said the scandals proved the government had few qualms about committing electoral fraud and intervention. Likewise, former presidential candidate Joaquín Lavín said that the victory of Lagos by a razor-thin 2.62% margin in 2000 could have been due to election fraud. No proof was ever given for such claim. = Whistleblowers = The crisis deepened when Edgardo Boeninger, a Christian Democrat and former Minister Secretary General of the Presidency, said in an interview with influential Chilean newspaper El Mercurio that \\"since the beginning of the Concertación it was thought that, since the private sector's money favored the right-wing parties, it would not be illegitimate to receive public [government] money.\\". His declarations were supported by former deputy Jorge Schaulsohn, founder and former president of the Party for Democracy. Also in an interview with El Mercurio, Schaulsohn said that during the time he presided over his party, all of the four parties of the Concertación coalition received money from the government. Additionally, Schaulsohn reported that government money had also been used to directly finance the campaigns of Concertación candidates. He accused the government and the Concertación of an \\"ideology of corruption\\". Lastly, former president and deputy of the Socialist Party Gonzalo Martner in another interview with El Mercurio declared that Schaulsohn's accusations were correct, and that \\"public resources were used to finance the activities of the political parties [of the Concertación]\\". All the leaders of the Concertación denied the charges of Boeninger, Schaulsohn, and Martner. However, in El Mercurio former president Patricio Aylwin acknowledged that some ministers in his cabinet had been paid extra money that came from government reserved funds, though he denied the charges of an \\"ideology of corruption\\". Other former government officials agreed with these three whistleblowers. = Crisis in the PPD = Although all the parties denied receiving money from the government, only the Party for Democracy (PPD) took action against the whistleblowers. The Supreme Tribunal of the party requested that Schaulsohn testify and present evidence of corruption. Instead, Schaulsohn wrote a report stating his opinions. On December 28, the Tribunal decided to dismiss Schaulsohn from the party. This act caused outrage among many Concertación members, some of whom likened the Tribunal's decision to Stalin's purges. Many wondered why Schaulsohn had been dismissed but no such action was undertaken for Girardi, who is under investigation by the police for corruption. Former Minister of Public Works Juan Etcheberry resigned in protest of the \\"Stalinist\\" action of the Tribunal in dismissing Schaulsohn. Senator Flores was one of the prime opponents of the Tribunal's decision. Because of the influence he wields in the party, it was expected that if he resigned, many other members, including more than a few deputies, would resign with him. Flores spoke with Schaulsohn at length during the time both of them stayed in the United States in New Year (Flores has a family in California and Schaulsohn was in New York City). His conferences with the Party of Democracy's president, Sergio Bitar, came to nothing. He then launched an independent political organization called Chile Primero (Chile First) in what many believed to be a prelude towards his resignation. He finally submitted his resignation in the morning of January 9, 2006. = Effects = Former President Michele Bachelet, who belongs to the Concertación, has said little regarding the corruption scandals. Meanwhile, former President Patricio Aylwin has been the only one to acknowledge that there might have been corruption during his government, although he insists that if there was, it was not an \\"ideology\\" as Schaulsohn described it. Former President and current President of the Senate Eduardo Frei has denied there was corruption during his government, and former President Ricardo Lagos has done likewise. The presidents of the four Concertación parties have all denied that their parties received or have ever received money from the government. The Socialist Party President Camilo Escalona was particularly enraged by Schaulsohn's remarks, and threatened to sue him for libel. Sergio Bitar of the Party for Democracy said he would not interfere with the Tribunal's decision to dismiss Schaulsohn, although he remarked it would've been better if he had not been dismissed. After Flores' resignation, Bitar declared that he had done \\"everything possible\\" to maintain party unity and that any \\"responsibility\\" lay on those who voluntarily left. Bitar maintained he hoped to have positive relations with Flores despite the latter's resignation. The next day, Flores supporter and deputy Esteban Valenzuela also resigned. = Investigations = The opposition Alliance for Chile pressed for investigations regarding the recent discoveries of corruption. The case is currently being investigated by Judge Macarena Rubilar, of the Second Criminal Court of Santiago. On January 6, she called Boeninger, Martner, and Genaro Arriagada (the latter had also spoken of corruption in the government) to testify. Schaulsohn testified before Judge Carlos Aránguiz of the Court of Appeals of Rancagua on January 10, upon his return from a New Years trip to New York City. Meanwhile, the Alliance for Chile requested the creation of an investigative commission regarding the corruption in the Chamber of Deputies. The commission was originally headed by Nicolás Monckeberg, of the opposition, but the Concertación members of the commission requested that Monckeberg be censured for his supposedly \\"overagressive\\" interrogation of the chairman of Chiledeportes, Catalina Depassier. Monckeberg denied that he mistreated Depassier and the Alliance accused the Concertación of trying to halt the investigations. When Monckeberg was finally replaced by Enrique Jaramillo (a member of the Concertación), the Alliance withdrew from the commission in protest. Instead, the Alliance decided to do their own investigation into the corruption, and presented their report the same day the Concertación presented the official one. The Alliance's report was much more critical than the official one, and accused PPD deputies Rodrigo González, Marco Antonio Núñez, Laura Soto, and Socialist deputy Marco Enríquez-Ominami to have been involved in corruption during their election campaigns. The official report limited itself to blaming the former independent of Valparaíso, Luis Guastavino. When the Chamber voted to accept the official report, the Christian Democrats decided to abstain, declaring that the electoral fraud and intervention that was uncovered benefited the Party of Democracy and the Socialist Party. Therefore, falling four votes short of the necessary 58 votes, the official report was rejected by the Chamber. The Alianza's report, among other things, discovered that the head of Chiledeportes, Christian Democrat Catalina Depassier, lied about her credentials. In her official curriculum, Depassier stated that she had graduated with a license in philosophy from the University of Chile. In an interview with the press, Monckeberg stated that a phone call with the vice-headmaster of the university revealed that Depassier had never graduated from that institution. \\"The University explained that [Depassier] only studied Humanitites there for a semester in '85. They also told us that in '84, [she] also studied for one semester in the school of Government and Public Service, which she left for academic reasons,\\" Monckeberg said in an interview with El Mercurio. On January 23, two days after Monckeberg's declarations, Depassier submitted her resignation to President Bachelet, which was approved. In a later press interview, Depassier apologized for the false information about her curriculum. She lashed out against the Alliance, accusing them of waging a \\"personal\\" campaign against her. The presidents of the UDI and National Renewal both denied that there was a \\"personal factor\\" in the accusations. The UDI president added, \\"It was she who lied to the country. She should not try to protect herself by blaming those who have made proven accusations against her\\". Meanwhile, deputies Soto and González denied the charges that they had used government money to fund their election campaigns, saying the accusations were a \\"political maneuver by the right\\". On January 25, they \\"froze\\" their membership of the Party for Democracy, supposedly to avoid harming the party. =Trials= The Public Ministry formally charged Deputy Laura Soto with embezzlement for using state funds of the Programas de Generación de Empleo (PGE, Job Making Programs) to finance her 2005 electoral campaign on March 5, 2007. Soto refused to attend the hearing, and her attorney Juan Carlos Manríquez declared that she believed her presence was unnecessary. Manríquez also questioned the legality of subjecting a congressperson to an investigation and trial. He criticized the Public Ministry for not having insufficient evidence and declared the Constitutional Tribunal should decide whether Soto should be investigated. Judge Jorge Abott responded by saying the Public Ministry would continue their investigation. Soto denied critics' assertions that she was \\"hiding\\" from the investigation and trying to use her position as deputy to halt them. She also denied any knowledge of the use of PGE money to fund her campaign. The Public Ministry has announced it is also investigating Soto's daughter Marisol Paniagua, member of the municipal council of Valparaíso, and José Manuel Mancilla, Regional Secretary of Labor in the Valparaíso Region, for embezzling using the PGE money. Deputy Rodrigo González, facing the same charges, will be charged on April. Laura Soto has been acquitted of all charges by the tribunal.

Interior The Weltmuseum Wien (former Museum of Ethnology) in Vienna is the largest anthropological museum in Austria, established in 1876. It currently resides in the Hofburg Imperial Palace and houses more than 400,000 ethnographical and archaeological objects from Asia, Africa, Oceania, and America. Since November 2014 the museum was closed due to renovation and was reopened on the 25th of October 2017.  Collections  The museum’s collections comprise more than 200,000 ethnographic objects, 100,000 photographs and 146,000 printed works from all over the world. Important collections include Mexican artifacts, such as a unique Aztec feathered headdress; part of James Cook's collection of Polynesian and Northwest Coast art (purchased in 1806); numerous Benin bronzes; the collection of Charles von Hügel from India, Southeast Asia, and China; collections from the Austrian Brazil Expedition; artifacts collected during the circumnavigation of the globe by the SMS Novara; and two of the remaining rongorongo tablets. The museum's most famous piece is a feathered headdress which tradition holds belonged to Moctezuma II, the Aztec emperor at the time of the Spanish Conquest. This has created friction between the Mexican and the Austrian governments. Originally taken as war booty by the Spanish in the 16th century, Austria acquired it from France in 1880. = Departments = *Sub-Saharan Africa *North Africa, Middle East, Central Asia and Siberia *East Asia: China, Korea, Japan *Insular Southeast Asia *South Asia, Southeast Asia, Himalayas *Oceania and Australia *North and Central America *South America *Photo Collection  History  = Ethnographic collections in Austria before 1876 = Early ethnographic collections in Austria date back to the 16th century. The so-called “Kunst- und Wunderkammern“ comprised many objects, such as the collection by Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria, which was stored in Ambras Castle in Innsbruck. In the course of the Coalition Wars these objects were transferred to Vienna. Other important collections were assembled by numerous explorers and travellers, such as Johann Natterer, who accompanied the Austrian Brazil Expedition from 1817 to 1835, or the scientists of the Austrian frigate ”SMS Novara” = k.u.k. Monarchy = In 1876 the Imperial and Royal Court Museum of Natural History – predecessor of the Museum of Ethnology – was established, consisting of five departments. In the years following Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria’s journey round the world (1892/93), the collections of the Anthropological-Ethnographic Department were separated from the museum and installed in the Hofburg Imperial Palace, combined with the Archduke’s collection, which comprised more than 14,000 objects and around 1,100 photographs. This “Museum of Ethnology” was opened on 28 May 1928. In the postwar period extensive reconstruction works were undertaken. The museum also presented numerous temporary exhibitions at two permanent outposts – Schloss Matzen and the Gaming Charterhouse. = From „Museum of Ethnology to \\"Weltmuseum Wien\\"= In the 1990s and the early years of the new millennium a comprehensive renovation of the museum became necessary. Amongst other things, the cellars were adapted to depots, galleries were renovated and additional office rooms were built. In the course of the semi-privatisation of Austria’s federal museums, the museum was incorporated into the museum group KHM-Museumsverband in 2001. In April 2013 the museum was renamed as Weltmuseum Wien.

However, since many of the most famous locations were on public lands (and the rules of use for the filming stipulated that the sites be returned to their natural state), only a few, like \\"Hobbiton\\" near Matamata retain any traces of the film sets. Tolkien tourism is a phenomenon of fans of The Lord of the Rings fictional universe travelling to sites of film- and book-related significance. It is especially notable in New Zealand, site of the movie trilogy by Peter Jackson, where it is credited as having raised the annual tourism numbers. Origins The three films (The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) based on the novel The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien were shot in various locations throughout New Zealand, and many of these locations have been preserved and altered to encourage the tourism that makes up a significant portion of the country’s economy. On some Lord of the Rings film location tours, tourists are provided time to indulge in cosplay, and dress as characters from the books or films. In New Zealand Mount Sunday (filming location of Edoras) New Zealand is in a unique position to capitalize on its scenery. Tolkien tourist attention is less geared towards visiting New Zealand's national parks and more focused on scenery that was used as back drops in movies. For example, Mount Olympus, dramatic pillars of rock carved out by nature and time, sits in Kahurangi National Park near Nelson in a remote corner of the South Island. Since it featured in The Fellowship of the Ring, the first of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Mount Olympus has become a spot for Tolkien tourists. Mount Sunday, in a remote area west of the Canterbury plains, served as the location of Edoras. Although no traces of the filming remain, complete day tour packages to it are available from Christchurch. Film NZ—the national film promotion board—advertises that New Zealand offers an English-speaking, largely nonunion work force, along with a kaleidoscope of urban and rural landscapes. \\"Experience New Zealand, Home of Middle Earth,\\" urges Tourism New Zealand's Web site,The official site for New Zealand Travel & Business: US Edition > New Zealand (reference outdated) and once tourists get there, they are invited to find film locations around New Zealand with a free \\"Middle Earth map.\\" Currently New Zealand is negotiating with Peter Jackson and New Line Cinema, the films' producers, to construct a permanent Lord of the Rings museum for some of the 40,000 props and costumes now warehoused in New Zealand. Jan Howard Finder, the science fiction writer, has organized special hostel-based tours of New Zealand to see places filmed in Lord of the Rings.Lastfa web site discussion Mount Ngauruhoe served as Mount Doom in the movies. =Economic effects= The annual tourist influx to New Zealand grew 40%, from 1.7 million in 2000 to 2.4 million in 2006, which some have attributed to be to a large degree due to The Lord of the Rings phenomenon. 6% of international visitors cited the film as a reason for traveling to the country. \\"You can argue that Lord of the Rings was the best unpaid advertisement that New Zealand has ever had\\", said Bruce Lahood, United States and Canadian regional manager for Tourism New Zealand. An article published by The New York Times contradicts Lahood, stating that New Zealand subsidized the movie trilogy with $150 million. The Hobbit filming \\"Hobbiton\\" movie set was renovated and re-used for The Hobbit trilogy and is now maintained to that standard for movie set tours Many experts and New Zealanders hoped for a renewed Tolkien effect because The Hobbit was also filmed in New Zealand. Whether or not this was vitally important to New Zealand's tourism industry was a big debating point during short-lived fears that industrial disputes could make the film production occur outside of the country. The government of New Zealand also saw some criticism for increasing movie subsidies and creating laws tailored for US movie companies, solely out of fear of losing the production. Some have subsequently called the price $25 million (in further financial subsidies and specific laws made for the producers benefit) that New Zealand had to pay to retain the movie 'extortionate' and argued that the discussion had occurred in a climate of 'hyperbole and hysteria'. An even higher price of at least $109 million has also been cited. South Africa and the United Kingdom Tolkien tourism has also existed to a lesser extent independent from the Jackson movies. Most notable are the following destinations: *Oxford, United Kingdom: aside from the colleges where Tolkien taught, the pubs he and the Inklings frequented (The Eagle and Child in particular capitalises on Tolkien's former patronage in its signage and interior decoration), the church he and his wife attended, and his former homes, The Tolkien Society organizes the Oxonmoot in one of the colleges September each year. In 1992 the centennial was also celebrated in Oxford. *Birmingham, United Kingdom: in 2005, The Tolkien Society hosted Tolkien 2005 at Aston University in the city where Tolkien lived and taught for many years to celebrate The Lord of the Rings 50th anniversary. *Bloemfontein, Free State, South Africa: Tolkien was born in Bloemfontein on 3 January 1892. The Bank of Africa building site has been recovered (a commemoration plaque used to be on the new building on the lot but this was later moved elsewhere due to theft risk), the grave of Tolkien's father has been recovered and a new tombstone erected.

Personal life Born in Ecclesfield, Sheffield, Blair is the son of former Scottish international Jimmy Blair Sr. and brother of Jimmy Blair Jr.. Career Blair started out at Blackpool, signing for the club in May 1939. However the outbreak of the Second World War soon after meant he never featured for the club in the Football League.

The judiciary of the Republic of Chile includes one Supreme Court, one Constitutional Court, 16 Courts of Appeal, 84 Oral Criminal Tribunals and Guarantee Judges; 7 Military Tribunals; over 300 Local Police Courts; and many other specialized Tribunals and courts in matter of family, labor, customs, taxes, electoral affairs, etc. The law provides for an independent judiciary, and the government generally respected this provision in practice.Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Chile. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (March 6, 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Chile's legal system is civil law based. It is primarily based on the Chilean Civil Code of 1855, derived from Spanish law and other codes of Continental Europe of the 19th century. Chilean process provides for a very limited judicial review of legislative acts in the Constitutional Court. It does not accept compulsory International Court of Justice (ICJ) jurisdiction. From the year 2000 onwards, Chile completely overhauled its criminal justice system with the implementation of a new, German-inspired, adversarial system, gradually implemented throughout the country, with the final stage of implementation in the Santiago Metropolitan Region completed on June 16, 2005. On 4 September 2013, a week before the 40th anniversary of the coup that brought General Pinochet to power, the National Association of Magistrates of the Judiciary apologised for abandoning its role in protecting basic rights during Chile's military rule in the 1970s and 1980s.Chile's judges apologise for their actions after coup, 4 September 2013, BBC Supreme Court Plenary courtroom of the Supreme Court. The head of the Chilean Judiciary System is the Supreme Court of Justice, a body integrated by twenty one members called \\"Ministers\\" (Ministros), one of them is elected by its peers as the President for a two-year period. Supreme Court's Ministers are designated by the President of the Republic, who chooses from five candidates proposed by the Supreme Court, with the agreement of the Senate. Of the twenty one members of the Supreme Court, sixteen must be judges of Courts of Appeal and five must be lawyers not related to the judiciary system. All members must be lawyers with at least fifteen years of professional exercise, with a distinguished professional or academical career and several other requirements established by the law. The Supreme Court of Justice is in charge of the directive, correctional and economical superintendence of all the courts of the country, save the Constitutional Court, the National Board of Elections and the Regional Boards of Elections. According to the Organic Code of Courts, the Supreme Court is officially referred to as \\"Excellence\\" (Excelencia) and its Ministers as \\"Your Honor\\" (Su Señoría), just like all other judges. Cases submitted to the knowledge of the Supreme Court can be examined in two ways: in plenary of at least eleven Ministers or in chambers of at least five Ministers. The regular operation of the Court is in four chambers of five Ministers, at least three of them must be judges, while the other two can be lawyers or judges. One of the most important functions of the Supreme Court is acting as a Court of Cassation, seeking the standard application of the law to all alike cases, in order to maintain a uniform interpretation of the law throughout the country. According to Chilean civil law system, the sentence of one judge only affects the case on which such sentence was dictated, nevertheless, the decisions of the Supreme Court are a strong precedent which is usually replicated by the lower instance courts and judges when deciding about similar cases. Courts of Appeal One of the rooms of the Courts of Appeals of Santiago. =Court of Appeal= There are seventeen Courts of Appeal in Chile, each of them integrated by a variable number of judges, between four and thirty one, called \\"Ministers\\" (Ministros), one of them is the President of the Court. These collegiate courts usually operate in chambers of at least three judges, exceptionally may operate as a plenary with the presence of the absolute majority of the members of the court. The Courts of Appeal are the hierarchical superiors to the Courts of Letters, the Courts of Guarantee, the Oral Criminal Tribunals, Family Courts, Labour Courts, Labour Courts of Collection, and Local Police Courts. They hold almost all the second instance competence, besides knowing well in the first instance or single instance of other matters that the laws entrusted to them. =Minister of Appeal= Each Minister of a Court of Appeal is a Court himself, knowing in the first instance of certain affairs that the laws entrusted to them. Even though the law has given all of the competence in the first instance to the Judges of Letters, a Minister of Appeal will try should certain exceptional circumstances are fulfilled, regarding the nature of the issue or the quality or state of the individuals involved. Criminal Justice System Santiago Province. The right wing of the building is also the Headquarters of the Public Ministry and the office of the National Attorney of Chile. Courtroom of a Criminal Court of Oral Judgments in Santiago. =Public Ministry= The Prosecution, or Public Ministry, is an autonomous public organism, whose function is to direct the investigation of the crimes, take the offenders to the Courts, if applicable, and to offer protection to victims and witnesses. The Prosecution is not a part of any of the other branches of the government, it's not part of the Congress, the Executive Branch or the Judiciary. The institution is organized in 18 Regional Prosecutions, each one of them directed by a regional prosecutor and a directive team. The operative units of the 18 Regional Prosecutions are the 150 Local Prosecutions which are distributed throughout the country according to population density. Such units are composed by deputy prosecutors, assistant prosecutors and other professionals, such as psychologists, caseworkers, administrative personnel and technicians. The criminal system is directed by the prosecutors, who are in charge of the investigation of crimes, directing the labor of the police forces. =Guarantee Courts= While the Prosecution is in exclusive charge of the functions of investigation and accusation, the guarantee judges have the exclusive task of judging, they have no power to investigate crimes, only to try them. During the investigative phase, a Guarantee Judge takes charge of the protection of the rights of the people involved in the case, specially the guarantee of the accused, as well as resolving the conflicts that arise between the different parts during this stage. Several proceedings of the Prosecution need previous approval by the Guarantee Court. Once enough proof is gathered, the Prosecution will decide whether to indict the accused or file the case. For most minor offenses and some simple crimes for which the prosecutor in the Attorney General sought the imposition of a penalty of up to 540 days of imprisonment, the case is judged by the Guarantee Judge in a summary trial. =Criminal Courts of Oral Judgments= Criminal Courts are integrated by three professional judges, who hear the cases exposed by the Prosecutor and the Defense of the accused, then deciding and establishing the guilt or innocence of the accused. Such scheme aims to provide the highest impartiality level of the Courts. There's no appeal nor second - instance revision of the sentences dictated by an Oral Criminal Court, the only remedy is its annulment by a Court of Appeals, which is uncommon.0 Family Justice System =Competence= The Family Judicial System has competence over matters related to custody of children, visiting arrangements of the children, alimony, maintenance or spousal support; parental rights, authorization to take the children out of the country, adoption, protective measures for children and teenagers, criminal offenses committed by minors exempt of criminal responsibility; fatherhood, divorce, marriage annulment, domestic violence, separation of assets, interdictions and any other issue arising from personal family relations. =Family Tribunals= There's a system of specialized professional courts exclusively dedicated to take charge of family conflicts in an integral and multidisciplinary approach, counting with the permanent assessment of psychologists and caseworkers specialized on family issues. The procedures are totally oral, transparent and immediate, therefore, the judge and all the parts of the trial must be present in all audiences and the actuations must be done without the intervention of intermediaries. The trial consists of, basically, two audiences: the first is called \\"Preparatory\\", if the parts don't come to a pacific agreement in such instance, the demand is submitted to the ratification of the demanding part, then the counterpart is given its chance to answer to it. By the end of the audience, the judge will decide about the relief measures and, if it is possible, will offer the parts a chance of mediation of conciliation. The judge will also set the object of the trial, the facts that will be object of proof, the admissible means of evidence and, finally, will set the date of the Audience of Trial. In the Audience of Trial, the parts will exhibit its evidence to the judge, such as witnesses, confessions, documents, medical records, and all other non regulated evidence. At the end of the audience, the judge will dictate an oral sentence, which can be written immediately or in a period of five days. =Mediation Institutes= They seek agreements between the parts involved, the so-called \\"cooperative agreements\\", through compromises, conciliation and, specially, mediation, is a very important goal of the system, so a National System of Mediation was established for such purpose. The primary goal of this system is to reduce the emotional costs of the conflict and obtain a personal and voluntary compromise of those involved, in order to reach a sustainable and amicable relation for the future. Trial procedures The criminal procedural law provides for the right to a fair trial and an independent judiciary generally enforced this right. National and regional prosecutors investigate crimes, formulate charges, and prosecute cases. Three-judge panels form the court of first instance; the process is oral and adversarial, trials are public, and judges rule on guilt and dictate sentences. Court records, rulings, and findings were generally accessible to the public. In all cases, the law provides for the right to legal counsel and public defender's offices in all fifteen Regions and the Santiago Metropolitan Region, provide free professional legal counsel to anyone seeking such assistance. When requested by other human rights organizations or family members, the NGO Corporation for the Promotion and Defense of the Rights of the People and other lawyers working pro bono assisted detainees during interrogations and represented some persons charged with terrorist acts in court. Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence and have a right of appeal. If formal charges are filed in civilian courts against a member of the military or police, for acts performed on duty, the military prosecutor can ask for jurisdiction, which the Supreme Court occasionally granted. This was particularly significant in human rights cases from the period covered by the Amnesty Law, since military courts were more likely to grant amnesty without a full investigation. Military courts have the authority to charge and try civilians for terrorist acts, aggressions against on duty police or military personnel, and sedition. Persons arrested during demonstrations for assaulting a police officer also are brought before military tribunals. Civilians prosecuted in military courts have the same legal protections as those prosecuted in civilian courts. They are entitled to counsel, the charges are public, the sentencing guidelines are the same (with the exception that the death penalty can be imposed in a military court during wartime but never in a civilian court), and the Supreme Court ultimately may hear appeals. A military prosecutor formulates charges and conducts the investigation, and the first instance of appeal is in a court-martial, composed of two civilian and three military judges. Civil judicial procedures and remedies While there is an independent and impartial judiciary in civil matters, which permits access for lawsuits regarding human rights violations, modernization of the judiciary has yet to affect the civil justice system, which was characterized by antiquated and inefficient procedures. Courts were overwhelmed by more than 800,000 new cases each year. The average civil trial lasts more than five years, and civil suits could continue for decades. Additionally, only 8 percent of lawsuits result in a definitive sentence or court-imposed settlement. Of the rest, 90 percent are eventually resolved through mediation outside the courts or settlement between the parties.

Additional human rights concerns in the country include use of excessive force and abuse by security forces, isolated reports of government corruption, and anti-Semitism. Authorities generally maintain effective control over the security forces. However, security forces occasionally commit human rights abuses. The government generally takes steps to prosecute officials who commit abuses. Nevertheless, many human rights organizations contend that security officials accused of committing abuses have impunity.Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2013 (10 April 2014). Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, United States Department of State. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Human rights violations by the military and security forces in Chile were widespread during the rule of General Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990). Estimates of the number killed and \\"disappeared\\" during the Pinochet regime range as high as 17,000.Johnson, Sandy A. (2011). Challenges in Health and Development: From Global to Community Perspectives. Springer. . pp. 85.  History  = Background = Early efforts for human rights in Latin America grew out of the Catholic Church. Major social breakdowns in Latin America had increased the number of human rights violations. The feelings of many Latin Americans had changed, with a concern for human rights growing out of their Catholic faith. According to Oxfam, the \\"vast majority\\" of citizen advocates first acquired experience in taking control of their lives through Christian communities in the 1960s and 1970s. Advocates of human rights criticize governments and attempt to raise public awareness of government repression, torture, and denial of habeas corpus. These efforts were spurred on by the Medellin Conference of Catholic bishops in 1968, itself a response to Vatican II. The bishops urged the church to \\"favor the efforts of the people to create and develop their own grassroots organizations for the redress and consolidation of their rights.\\" Human rights organizations in Latin America were unknown or existed only on paper before the 1960s. In Chile, the tiny Committee for the Defense of Human Rights led by labor leader Clotario Blest existed in 1972, a year before the coup but was inactive. Movements to defend human rights in Latin America lagged behind the military takeovers, with the exception of Chile, where actitivites in response to the 1973 Chilean coup d'etat began almost immediately. = 1973 coup d'etat = On a military junta toppled President Salvador Allende in a coup d'état and installed General Augusto Pinochet as head of the new regime. This was a dictatorial, authoritarian regime which trampled on human rights with the use of torture, disappearances, illegal and secret arrest, and extrajudicial killings. Thousands were being detained, and hundreds killed by the regime. It was in this context, that the first organized opposition to the Pinochet regime appeared. = 1970s NGOs = Opposition to the military dictatorship began within days of the coup, and the first organization appeared within a month. As was the case elsewhere, this began in Chile with the Catholic Church. The first organized opposition to the regime came from the churches. The Committee of Cooperation for Peace in Chile was founded by five Christian churches and the Jewish community in Chile on and led by Archbishop Raul Silva Henriquez with a stated goal of \\"helping Chileans, who, as a result of recent political events, are in dire economic or personal straits,\\" and also to provide \\"legal, economic, technical, and spiritual\\" assistance. The Committee for Peace carried out its human rights activity in the face of harassment and intimidation by the government, and was a risky proposition for those involved. In the two years of its operation, it provided support for 17,000 people persecuted by the government, as well as people detained for political reasons without trial. It also played a support role for those who lost their job for political reasons, and provided medical care. The committee was shut down under direct pressure from Pinochet in November 1975, but it contained the seeds for the founding of other organizations. The Association of Families of the Detained-Disappeared (AFDD) is a Chilean human rights group that coalesced in Santiago in 1974 and was launched formally by Clotario Blest in 1975. It grew out of a group of members, mostly women, of the Committee of Cooperation for Peace in Chile. The main focus of the AFDD was to maintain awareness of the desaparecidos () in the public eye, and to pressure the government to release information about them. After the reestablishment of democracy in Chile and the 1989 election of President Patricio Aylwin, the goals and pressure brought to bear by the AFDD on the new, democractic government played an influential role in the establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1990.  Respect for the integrity of the person  = Arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life = A monument inaugurated in 2006 to commemorate the Caso Degollados, the slaying by police forces of three Communist Party members in 1985. There were no reports that the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings during 2013. The external mechanism to investigate abuses by Carabineros is the military justice system, while the regular criminal justice system investigates accusations of abuse by investigative police (PDI) officers. On January 3, authorities arrested six of eight former army officers indicted for the 1973 torture and subsequent execution of singer Victor Jara in the Estadio Chile in Santiago. On March 28, the Santiago Appellate Court approved bail for four of the eight. On October 11, the judge indicted and arrested a ninth former army officer. The case remained pending at year's end. In June 2012 the Santiago Appellate Court ruled that Judge Mario Carroza should investigate the killing of U.S. citizen Ronnie Moffit in a Washington, D.C. car bombing in 1976. The case was pending at year's end. According to the Diego Portales University (UDP) Law School's 2013 annual report on human rights, as of July the Supreme Court had ruled in 153 criminal cases of dictatorship-era human rights violations and confirmed 140 convictions, while 1,350 cases against more than 800 perpetrators remained under investigation or pending in the courts. On March 25, a military prosecutor indicted former Carabinero sergeant Miguel Millacura for using unnecessary force and Lieutenant Claudia Iglesias for complicity in covering up Carabinero involvement in the 2011 killing of 16-year-old Manuel Gutierrez. Millacura was free on bail, and Iglesias reportedly continued on active duty. The status of the case in the military justice system against Millacura was unknown at year's end. Cases involving alleged unlawful conduct by Carabineros, including human rights abuses against civilians, were generally tried in the military court system, as were allegations where the accused is a member of the armed forces. = Disappearance = There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances. In August 2012 Judge Jorge Zepeda indicted eight former Carabineros and army patrol members for aggravated kidnapping in the 1985 disappearance case of U.S. citizen Boris Weisfeiler. The case remained pending at year's end; those charged remained free on bail. = Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment = Although the constitution prohibits such practices, credible nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) received multiple reports of excessive force, abuse, and degrading treatment by Carabineros, PDI members, and prison guards, few of which resulted in convictions. On June 13, 2013 Carabineros entered the downtown central campus of the University of Chile, allegedly without authorization and in a violent manner, in search of connections to several violent activities that took place the day before during an authorized student protest. According to local press, police seriously injured two female students resisting the unauthorized entrance. The head of the police unit involved was transferred to another unit after an internal investigation revealed a violation of protocol regarding the use of force. No further disciplinary action was taken. On December 30, 2013 PDI officer Flavio Torres was charged in a Santiago court for unlawful coercion and computer crimes for his alleged role in the beating during the interrogation of a minor following a student protest in May. Torres was accused of participating in a group of approximately 10 officers who struck the minor's neck and face, photographed him in his underwear, and forced him to reveal his Facebook log-in credentials. The prosecutor said she was unable to determine the identities of others alleged to have been involved due to the invocation by the PDI of a provision of the country's National Intelligence Law. The judge, who remanded Torres into custody during the case's investigative phase, called the alleged crimes “among the most serious” contemplated by Chile's laws because they involved a state agent. The case was pending at year's end. The National Institute of Human Rights (INDH) and media outlets reported on the alleged inappropriate use of force by prison guards in breaking up a protest at a prison in Valdivia in January 2013, resulting in injuries to 21 inmates. The Court of Appeals of Valdivia subsequently made a special order of protection on behalf of the inmates. The Court of Appeals of Antofagasta ruled that prison guards violated constitutional rights of 10 inmates and breached the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment during a violent encounter in July when the guards beat and shot pellets at prisoners, resulting in injuries.  Prison and detention center conditions  Prison conditions were harsh. Human rights organizations reported that violence, including torture, occurred and that prison officials were aware of the problem and worked to address it. Violence among inmates was also common. Physical Conditions: Prisons were overcrowded. The government reported that at the end of September 2013, 45,510 prisoners were in prisons designed to hold 41,034 inmates. Prisoners included 3,540 women (held in separate sections of the same facilities as men or in separate facilities). At the end of August, 3,054 minors were in prisons or detention centers (held separately from the adult population). Many prisons were antiquated and offered substandard sanitary conditions, inadequate food, and insufficient medical services. Inadequate heating in some prisons remained a serious problem, and inadequate lighting and ventilation also affected inmates at some prisons. The government reported that access to potable water was limited in several prisons. Officials reported 186 prisoner deaths during 2013. Violence among inmates accounted for 67 deaths, while three inmates died while attempting to escape prison. On August 13, a fire broke out in a prison in Quillota, located near the coastal city of Valparaiso, after two rival gangs started a fight. Although the fire was contained, approximately 24 inmates were injured in the incident, five due to stab wounds that occurred during the intergang violence. Prisoners with HIV/AIDS and mental and physical disabilities reportedly failed to receive adequate medical attention in some prisons. Adequate accommodations for those prisoners with physical disabilities were made. According to the rights organization Movement for Homosexual Integration and Liberation (MOVILH) and various media outlets, in November 2012 an official commission reported that in a number of prisons, LGBT prisoners were separated from the general population to prevent possible attacks. The commission noted that these separate facilities were overcrowded and lacked adequate basic hygienic services. Administration: Recordkeeping on prisoners was generally adequate, and authorities used alternative sentencing for nonviolent offenders, such as conditional release for community service. There were no prison ombudsmen. Prisoners and detainees had reasonable access to visitors and could observe their religious practices. Authorities permitted prisoners and detainees to submit complaints to judicial authorities without censorship and to request investigation of inhumane conditions. Authorities generally investigated credible allegations and documented the results in a publicly accessible manner. The government usually investigated and monitored prison and detention center conditions. Independent Monitoring: The government permitted prison visits by independent human rights observers, and such visits took place at both government and privately operated facilities. Prisoner and human rights groups continued to investigate alleged use of abuse or excessive force against detainees, while the media covered some such allegations. Improvements: Overcrowding decreased by almost 25 percent as of the end of September 2013, compared with levels at the end of 2012. The government transferred inmates between prisons and issued pardons to certain inmates to reduce overcrowding. Two prisons were completely renovated, while several others underwent repairs and upgrades. Improved health measures were also implemented, including increased spending on meals. Nutritionists were hired to advise on healthy meal plans, leading to new nutrition programs in all prisons. The Human Rights division of the Gendarmeria held human rights- focused workshops, seminars, and other training programs at various prisons for current and future prison guards. The government also carried out an exhaustive survey of inmates from 75 prisons throughout the country for the purpose of understanding prisoners’ perceptions of shortcomings in the penitentiary system, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life for prisoners. Based on those results, the Gendarmaria's human rights division planned to create a subdivision to monitor progress in efforts to address deficiencies and promote training of prison system personnel. Gendarmeria officials participated in two educational sessions organized by NGOs aimed at instilling in prison employees respect for diversity and skills for handling LGBT-related issues in prisons. The Gendarmeria and MOVILH signed an agreement in December 2013 to facilitate the voluntary work of certain prisoners for MOVILH, with the aim of enhancing the quality of life for LGBT prisoners by increasing tolerance in more of the general prison population through education and exposure to LGBT-related matters. The National Institute of Human Rights noted marked improvement in overall prison conditions. = Arbitrary arrest or detention = The constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, and the government generally observed these prohibitions.  Role of the police and security apparatus  Carabineros and the PDI have responsibility in law and practice for law enforcement and maintenance of order within the country. The Ministry of the Interior oversees both forces. Civilian authorities generally maintained effective control over Carabineros and the PDI, and the government has mechanisms to investigate and punish abuse and corruption. There were allegations of impunity involving security forces during 2013. Cases from prior years remained pending in courts, while rights organizations criticized the security apparatus for failing to carry out sufficient internal reviews of allegations of abuse by their members and to take forceful enough action where wrongdoing was established. The 2012 Human Rights Watch country report noted continued concern that military courts were not fully independent and that investigations and trials of police accused of abuses against civilians continued to be conducted under the military justice system. The external mechanism to investigate abuses by Carabineros is the military justice system, while accusations of abuses by PDI officers are investigated in the regular criminal justice system. The INDH stated in its 2013 annual report that there were 1,775 complaints against Carabineros in 2012 for “unnecessary violence” but that less than 2 percent of that number ended in convictions in the military justice system during the period. Carabineros accused of use of “unnecessary violence” are often reassigned within the institution where an internal investigation reveals wrongdoing. The INDH reported that government actions to reform the security forces were lacking.  Arrest procedures and treatment of detainees  Only public officials expressly authorized by law can arrest or detain citizens and generally did so openly with warrants based on sufficient evidence brought before an independent judiciary. Authorities must immediately inform a prosecutor of an arrest and generally did so. The prosecutor must open an investigation, receive a statement from the detainee, and ensure that the detainee is held at a local police station until the detention control hearing. Detention control hearings are held twice daily, allowing for a judicial determination of the legality of the detention within 24 hours of arrest. Detainees must be informed of their rights, including the right to an attorney and the right to remain silent until an attorney is present. Public defenders are provided to detainees who do not hire their own lawyer. Authorities must expedite notification of the detention to family members. If authorities do not inform the detainees of their rights upon detention, during the detention control hearing the judge can declare the process unlawful. The law allows judges to set bail, grant provisional liberty, or order continued detention as necessary for the investigation or the protection of the prisoner or the public. The law affords detainees 30 minutes of immediate and subsequent daily access to a lawyer (in the presence of a prison guard) and to a doctor to verify their physical condition. Regular visits by family members are allowed. Pretrial Detention: Through September an average of 150 days passed between the time of arrest and presentation of charges against persons accused of a crime. = Fair public trials = The constitution provides for an independent judiciary, and the government generally respected judicial independence. The constitution and law provide for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforced this right. Defendants enjoy a presumption of innocence and have a right of appeal. They have the right to be informed promptly of charges, have time to prepare their defense, and not be compelled to testify. The law provides for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforced this right. National and regional prosecutors investigate crimes, formulate charges, and prosecute cases. Three- judge panels form the court of first instance. The process is oral and adversarial; trials are public; defendants have the right to be present and consult with an attorney in a timely manner; and judges rule on guilt and dictate sentences. Defendants do not enjoy the right to a trial by jury. Court records, rulings, and findings were generally accessible to the public. The law provides for the right to legal counsel, and public defenders’ offices across the country provided professional legal counsel to anyone seeking such assistance. When human rights organizations or family members requested, the NGO Corporation for the Promotion and Defense of the Rights of the People and other lawyers working pro bono assisted detainees during interrogation and trial. Defendants can confront or question adverse witnesses and present witnesses and evidence on their behalf, although the law provides for secret witnesses in certain circumstances. Defendants and their attorneys generally have access to government-held evidence relevant to their cases. For crimes committed prior to the implementation of the 2005 judicial reforms, criminal proceedings are inquisitorial rather than adversarial. At end 2013 one inquisitorial criminal court remained open and had an extensive wait for trials. = Political prisoners and detainees = There were no reports of political prisoners or detainees, although some indigenous Mapuche convicted of criminal offenses claimed to be political prisoners. = Civil judicial procedures and remedies = There is an independent and impartial judiciary in civil matters, which permits individuals to seek civil remedies for human rights violations; however, the civil justice system retained antiquated and inefficient procedures. The average civil trial lasted approximately five years, and civil suits could continue for decades. Administrative and judicial remedies are available for alleged wrongs. Cases involving violations of an individual's human rights may be submitted through petitions by individuals or organizations to the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IACHR), which in turn may submit the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The court can order civil remedies including fair compensation to the individual injured. = Regional human rights court decisions = Chile is subject to the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court for Human Rights. On August 28, 2013 the court determined that the government was guilty of “undue delay” in investigating the exoneration claim of Leopoldo Garcia, who was tortured and exiled under the Pinochet government and submitted his request in 1993. The court ordered Chile to pay $32,000 in moral damages and to complete his investigation in a reasonable time. This was the first time the court ruled on a case involving the living survivor of human rights abuses from the Pinochet era. = Interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence = The constitution prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, and the government generally respected these prohibitions.  Respect for civil liberties  = Freedom of speech and the press = The constitution provides for freedom of speech and press, and the government generally respected these rights. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combined to promote freedom of speech and of the press. Although the independent media were active and expressed a wide variety of views without restriction, the 2013 Freedom House and Reporters Without Borders reports expressed concern with media concentration, whereby most media outlets are in the hands of two major family companies, Copesa and El Mercurio, and the unregulated distribution of government funded advertising. No legal framework exists to guarantee fair distributions of frequencies to different broadcast media. The penal code carries criminal sentences of six months to five years in jail for libel or slander. Press freedom groups called on the government to modify antiterrorism laws to limit their use on Chilean and foreign reporters, for example, on those who covered issues concerning Mapuche communities. = Internet freedom = There were no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms without appropriate legal authority. According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), approximately 41 percent of households had access to the Internet in 2012. = Academic freedom and cultural events = There were no government restrictions on academic freedom or cultural events. = Freedom of assembly = The government routinely granted permits for marches and demonstrations, occasionally refusing permission for certain routes, citing a concern for public safety. Police used tear gas and water cannons and forcibly removed or detained some protesters when participants vandalized property. = Freedom of association = The constitution provides for freedom of association, and the government generally respected this right. = Freedom of religion = This section contains information from the report International Religious Freedom Report for 2012 prepared by the State Department of the United States.International Religious Freedom Report for 2012 (9 May 2013). Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, United States Department of State. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The constitution and other laws and policies protect religious freedom and, in practice, the government generally respected religious freedom. The trend in the government's respect for religious freedom did not change significantly during the year. There were reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious affiliation, belief, or practice. Incidents of anti-Semitism included online harassment, verbal slurs, and increased vandalism. U.S. embassy officials discussed religious tolerance with the National Office of Religious Affairs (ONAR) and leaders of numerous religious groups, focusing on the value of deepening institutional cooperation. The embassy organized an iftar with an ecumenical group of religious leaders, and embassy officers attended interfaith events.  Government respect for religious freedom  The constitution and other laws and policies protect religious freedom. Church and state are officially separate. The law prohibits religious discrimination. The ONAR is part of the executive branch and is responsible for promoting religious freedom and tolerance. The office's mandate is to work with all religious organizations to implement constitutional provisions on religious freedom. The law allows any religious group to apply for religious nonprofit status. The Ministry of Justice may not refuse to accept a registration petition, although it may object to the petition within 90 days if all legal prerequisites for registration are not satisfied. The petitioner then has 60 days to address objections the ministry raises or challenge the ministry in court. Once registered, the state cannot dissolve a religious entity by decree. The semiautonomous Council for the Defense of the State may initiate a judicial review, but the government has never de-registered a legally registered group. The law allows religious group to adopt a charter and bylaws suited to a religious group rather than a private corporation. Religious groups may establish affiliates (schools, clubs, and sports organizations) without registering them as separate entities. There are more than 2,700 registered religious groups. An Anti-Discrimination Law approved on July 24 gives civil legal remedies to victims of various types of discrimination, including those based on religion or belief. The law also increases criminal penalties for acts of violence based on discrimination. Publicly subsidized schools must offer religious education for two teaching hours per week through high school. Parents may have their children excused from religious education. Local school administrators decide how funds are spent on religious instruction. The majority of religious instruction in public schools is Catholic, although the Ministry of Education has approved curricula for 14 other religious groups. Schools must teach the religion requested by the parents. Parents may homeschool their children for religious reasons or enroll them in private schools. The law grants religious groups the right to have chaplains in public hospitals, prisons, and military units. Regulations for the armed forces and law enforcement agencies allow officially registered religious groups to appoint chaplains to serve in each branch of the armed forces, in the national uniformed police, and the national investigative police. The ONAR trains clergy of various religions on hospital protocol and issues government identification badges. A new accreditation process implemented in June for representatives of all religions improves the access of hospital patients to their preferred religious representatives. The prison system has both Catholic and Protestant staff chaplains and a large number of volunteer chaplains. The government observes the following religious holidays as national holidays: Good Friday, the Feast of the Virgin of Carmen, the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, the Feast of the Assumption, National Day of Evangelical Churches, All Saints’ Day, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, and Christmas.  Government practices  There were no reports of abuses of religious freedom. Catholicism was the dominant religion in public schools, prisons, hospitals, and the military. Representatives from the ONAR held regular roundtable meetings with Protestant leaders to discuss mechanisms to increase Protestant pastoral presence in these institutions. Catholic chaplains outnumbered Protestant chaplains in all branches of the armed forces, and Protestant leaders continued to advocate for more paid chaplain positions. The celebration of Catholic mass frequently marked official and public events. At military events, all members of participating units were obliged to attend. Government officials attended Catholic events, and major Protestant and Jewish ceremonies. In October President Pinera announced the appointment of a rabbi as one of three chaplains serving La Moneda Palace, joining the Catholic and Protestant chaplains there. He also thanked the Jewish community for its many contributions to Chilean society. Members of the Jewish Community of Chile (CJCH) told the press the appointment reflected the country's movement toward greater tolerance and diversity. Enforcement of the requirement to provide non-Catholic education when parents requested it was weak. As part of a two- phase program, ONAR officials traveled to various regions and met with educators and religious leaders to stress that non-Catholic religion classes, specifically Protestant classes, must be offered when requested. The ONAR also provided assistance to municipal offices of religious affairs to develop community-supported curricula in public schools.  Societal respect for religious freedom  There were reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious affiliation, belief, or practice. Anti-Semitic incidents included verbal slurs, online harassment, and an increase in vandalism. Jewish government officials reported receiving anti-Semitic correspondence. Authorities and Jewish community groups noted an increase in anti-Semitic comments, including via social media. Street protests over education and other social issues led to increased levels of graffiti including swastikas and other expressions of anti-Semitism in major cities. In January 2012 anti- Semitic comments in social media spiked following claims that an Israeli tourist had started a forest fire. Protests in response to events in the Middle East, which normally took place at the Israeli embassy, expanded to the CJCH Center. On January 21, three youths beat and verbally harassed a 23-year- old Jewish man at a party in Ritoque. Others at the party refused to assist the victim or to transport him to the hospital. The CJCH condemned the act. On August 19, 2012 a neo-Nazi group in the Araucania Region attacked a 14-year- old boy and drew a swastika on his stomach with a syringe. In September, coinciding with the Jewish holidays of Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah, the CJCH in Santiago reported that vandals marked synagogues and schools with swastikas and the phrase “Juden raus,” meaning “Jews out.” The Jewish community noted an increase in anti-Semitism throughout the year and leaders took precautions to ensure their safety. On August 24, 2012 the president of the Palestinian Federation of South America, which represented more than 300,000 Chileans of Palestinian descent, made anti-Semitic remarks to the media, comparing Zionists to Nazis. Neo-Nazi and skinhead groups engaged in gang-type criminal activities and anti-Semitic rhetoric. = Freedom of movement = The constitution provides for freedom of internal movement, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, and the government generally respected these rights. The government cooperated with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in providing protection and assistance to internally displaced persons, refugees, returning refugees, asylum seekers, stateless persons, and other persons of concern. = Protection of refugees = The law provides for the granting of asylum or refugee status, and the government has established a system for providing protection to refugees. During the first nine months of 2013, six individuals received recognized refugee status, bringing the total number of refugees living in the country to 1,722.  Respect for political rights  = The right of citizens to change their government = The law provides citizens the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercised this right through periodic, free, and fair elections based on universal suffrage. = Elections and political participation = Recent Elections: On December 15, 2013 Michele Bachelet was elected president in a free and fair run-off election. On November 17, in elections generally considered free and fair, voters elected 20 of 38 senators and all members of the Chamber of Deputies. A first-round presidential election took place the same day, but no candidate received more than the required 50 percent to win in the first round. For the first time since a June reform law, regional counselors were also elected nationwide. Newly elected officials are to take office in March 2014. In October 2012 mayors and city council members were elected nationwide in free and fair elections, the first following a 2011 change in election laws making voter registration automatic and voting voluntary. Participation of Women and Minorities: There were 17 women in the 120-seat Chamber of Deputies and five women in the 38-seat Senate. There were six women in the 21-member cabinet. Indigenous people were active at the municipal level. Social, institutional, and cultural barriers limited indigenous participation in national elections, however.  Corruption and lack of transparency in government  The law provides criminal penalties for corruption by officials, and the government generally implemented these laws effectively. There were isolated reports of government corruption during the year, which was more prevalent at the local level than the national level. Corruption: On July 5, 2013 authorities disclosed that Carabineros deleted wire-tap logs planned for use as evidence in a 2012 case in which 10 PDI detectives were charged with detaining suspects, giving false testimony, drug trafficking, and extortion. The National Prosecutor's Office began an immediate investigation, which delayed proceedings in the 2012 case against Carabineros. On September 5, 2013 after a three-year investigation, a court convicted the mayor of Hualpen of tax fraud and bribery and sentenced him to three years’ probation, during which he cannot hold public office. On November 25, 2013 four members of Carabineros were arrested for alleged ties to drug trafficking. In response, Carabineros named a new counternarcotics chief and announced a plan to restructure the counternarcotics department. The Transparency Council is an autonomous government entity functioning to promote transparency in the public sector, monitor compliance, publish information on public offices, and guarantee access to information. The institution collaborated with civil society, operated effectively and independently, and had sufficient resources. It regularly published statistics on government compliance with the 2009 transparency law. Whistleblower Protection: The law provides protection to public and private employees for making disclosures of illegality through the National Public Defender's Office or the local police. Few cases have been brought under the law. Financial Disclosure: A regulation subjects public officials to financial disclosure and assigns responsibility to the comptroller for conducting audits of government agencies and to the Public Prosecutor's Office for initiating criminal investigations of official corruption. The law requires that all declarations be made public, provides sanctions for noncompliance, and clearly identifies which assets must be declared; however, it does not mandate a unit to monitor disclosures. Public Access to Information: The constitution requires the government and its agencies to make all unclassified information about their activities available to the public. The government granted citizens and noncitizens, including foreign media, access to all unclassified information. The law regulates government transparency and provides public access to information. The law applies to ministries; regional, provincial, and municipal level governments; the armed forces, police, and public security forces; and public enterprises where the state owns more than 50 percent or holds a majority of appointments on the board of directors. The law has a list of five exceptions for nondisclosure. Responses to any requests for information must be delivered within 20 business days, and there is no cost for the request. In cases of noncompliance, the head of the organization is subject to a fine between 20 percent and 50 percent of his or her monthly salary. The autonomous Transparency Council provides for the right of access to information and issues rulings on cases in which information is denied.  Investigation of alleged violations of human rights  A number of domestic and international human rights groups generally operated without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials were generally cooperative and responsive to their views, although some indigenous rights groups claimed their views were disregarded. Government Human Rights Bodies: The INDH, an autonomous government entity, operated independently, issued public statements, and proposed changes to government agencies or policies to promote and protect human rights. INDH's 2013 annual report noted concern over several human rights problems, including access to justice; excessive police force; violence against women and children; societal abuses against youth, immigrants, transgender persons, and other minorities; and the continued application of the antiterrorism law, including in cases involving members of indigenous communities. The Senate and Chamber of Deputies also have standing human rights committees responsible for drafting human rights legislation.  Discrimination, societal abuses, and trafficking in persons  The constitution states the all persons are born free and are equal in terms of the law and dignity; however, it does not specifically identify groups protected from discrimination. The 2012 Anti-Discrimination Law provides civil legal remedies to victims of discrimination based on race, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic situation, language, ideology or political opinion, religion or belief, association or participation in union organizations or lack thereof, gender, sexual orientation, gender identification, marriage status, age, affiliation, personal appearance, and sickness or physical disability. The law also increases criminal penalties for acts of violence based on discrimination, but such discrimination continued to occur. = Women = International Women's Day march in San Antonio, Chile Domestic violence against women is a serious problem. One study reported 74 percent of married women had suffered physical violence. Rape, including spousal rape, is a criminal offense; the government generally enforced the law. Experts believe that most rape cases went unreported. Although adult prostitution is legal, bordellos are not. Sexual harassment generally was recognized as a problem. A 2005 law against sexual harassment provides protection and financial compensation to victims and penalizes harassment by employers or co-workers. Most complaints are resolved quickly, resulting in action against the harasser in 33 percent of cases. Women enjoy the same legal rights as men, including rights under family law and property law. The quadrennial 2004 National Socio-Economic Survey suggested that the overall gender income gap remained at 33 percent, and women's workforce participation rose to 42 percent. The labor code provides specific benefits for pregnant workers and recent mothers. A 2005 study by Corporacion Humana and the University of Chile's Institute of Public Affairs revealed that 87 percent of women surveyed felt that women suffered discrimination. =Children= The government is committed to children's rights and welfare. Education is universal, compulsory, and free from first through 12th grade. The government provided basic health care through a public system, with equal access for girls and boys. Violence against children was a problem. A 2003 study by the Citizens' Peace Foundation indicated that 60 percent of children surveyed between the ages of seven and 10 had suffered some type of aggression against them or their belongings either inside or outside their homes. Child prostitution was a problem (see Human trafficking in Chile), as was child labor in the informal economy (see Labor rights in Chile). =Trafficking in persons= The law does not specifically prohibit trafficking in persons, and there were isolated reports that persons were trafficked to, from, and within the country for the purposes of sexual exploitation and involuntary domestic servitude. The law criminalizes promoting the entry into or exit from the country of persons for the purpose of facilitating prostitution, as well as the prostitution of children and corruption of minors. Most trafficking victims were minors trafficked internally for sexual exploitation. Law enforcement authorities stated that small numbers of victims were trafficked to the neighboring countries of Argentina, Peru, and Bolivia, as well as to the United States, Europe, and Asia. Anecdotal reports suggested that young women were the primary targets for trafficking to other countries. Traffickers looking for children also targeted economically disadvantaged families, convincing the parents that they were giving the child the opportunity for a better life. The government makes substantial efforts to prevent trafficking and to assist trafficking victims. =Persons with disabilities= The law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities, but such persons suffered forms of de facto discrimination. The law mandates access to buildings for persons with disabilities, but a Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning study based on a 2002-03 census showed that 70 percent of the buildings in the country designated as public or multiuse failed to meet that standard. An improved public transportation system in Santiago provided wheelchair access on major \\"trunk\\" routes. Some local \\"feeder\\" routes also provided low-rise buses with access ramps. Subway lines in the Santiago metropolitan area provided limited access for persons with disabilities. Public transport outside of Santiago was problematic. In April 2005, the government released its First National Study of Disability, which revealed that twice as many persons with disabilities were in the lower socioeconomic brackets as in the middle and upper brackets. Approximately 100,000 persons with disabilities under the age of 27 did not receive any special care or education. =Indigenous people= The 2002 census recorded approximately 692,000 self-identified persons of indigenous origin (5 percent of the total population). The law gives indigenous people a voice in decisions affecting their lands, cultures, and traditions and provides for bilingual education in schools with indigenous populations. Approximately one-half the self-identified indigenous population remained separated from the rest of society. Indigenous people also experienced some societal discrimination and reported incidents in which they were attacked and harassed. In 2011, the Inter-American Commission charged the Chilean government with racism for using the country's Anti-Terrorist Law against the Mapuche indigenous people.\\"Chile accused of racist use of anti-terrorism laws against Mapuches\\" (9 December 2011), Tian Spain and Mike Gatehouse, Latin American Bureau (London). =LGBT rights= Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons in Chile may face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Homosexuality was a crime until recently. Since 1998, both male and female same-sex sexual activity is legal in Chile. Since April 2015, same-sex couples have been eligible for civil unions but not same-sex marriage. Police abuse in Chile is a main issue for the gay community. Numerous cases of police abuse cannot be reported since it would be pointless report negative situations to the same institution. =Intersex rights= In 2015, Chile briefly became the second country to protect intersex infants and children from unnecessary medical interventions, following Malta, however, the regulations were superseded the following year by guidance permitting intersex medical interventions. Labor rights Workers have the right to form and join trade unions without prior authorization, and approximately 10 percent of the total work force is unionized. The law allows unions to conduct their activities without interference, and the government protects this right in practice. While employees in the private sector have the right to strike, the government regulates this right, and there are some restrictions. The law prohibits forced or compulsory labor, and there have been no reports that such practices occurred. The law restricts child labor, but it is a problem in the informal economy. There are reports that children are trafficked. The minimum wage is set by law and is subject to adjustment annually. The law sets the legal workweek at six days or 45 hours; the maximum workday length is 10 hours. The law establishes occupational safety and health standards. Human rights organizations The first human rights organization operating in Chile was the Committee of Cooperation for Peace in Chile formed by an interreligious group in 1973 in response to the torture, killings, and other violations of human rights following the 1973 Chilean coup d'etat. When the Pinochet regime forced its dissolution in November 1975, it was followed a few months later with the establishment of the Vicariate of Solidarity by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago. The Lutherans established a similar organization, the Foundation for Social Assistance of the Christian Churches (FASIC). Next to appear in 1974, were the Association of Families of the Detained-Disappeared, and Families of the Executed for Political Reasons; the Chilean Human Rights Commission appeared in 1978, the Commission for the Rights of the People in 1980, the National Commission Against Torture in 1982, and others.

Career Born in 1938 in Marseilles, France, he earned his medical degree and PhD at the University of Paris, and completed residencies in psychiatry and neurology in Paris and at the University of Geneva. While working at the Stanford University Sleep Disorders Clinic in 1972 as a visiting assistant professor, Guilleminault became keenly interested in reports published by Italian sleep researcher Elio Lugaresi who had reported that nocturnal hypertension was present in patients who snored. Guilleminault persuaded cardiologists John Shroeder and Ara Tilkian to spend nights in the hospital's clinical research center monitoring the systemic and pulmonary arterial blood pressure in sleeping patients. The team observed that when patients fell asleep and began snoring, prolonged pauses in their breathing (apneas) were noted that corresponded with dramatic elevations in their resting blood pressure, simulating strenuous exercise as if the patient were lifting weights.William C. Dement, The Promise of Sleep, Random House Inc. 1999, pg. 179 Guilleminault then went on to publish several articles illustrating dramatic improvements and reversal of sleep apnea following tracheostomies. Tracheostomy proved curative in these patients, and demonstrated reversal of cardiac arrhythmias and blood pressure abnormalities during sleep; temporarily capping these artificial airways would re-capitulate the changes of sleep apnea, further establishing the causative relationship between sleep apnea and cardiovascular abnormalities. Guilleminault then went on to describe obstructive sleep apnea in non-obese patients, being the first to coin the term \\"obstructive sleep apnea syndrome\\" (OSAS), a term commonly used nowadays. In addition, he described the presence of OSAS in children, demonstrating its association with learning and attention problems along with cardiovascular derangements. Following this work, he went on to describe the presence of elevated upper airway resistance in children in 1982, emphasizing the symptoms of attention deficit, hyperactivity, and abnormal behavior during wakefulness and sleep, learning disabilities and sleepwalking, sleep terrors and enuresis that accompanied this form of sleep-related breathing disorder; he described the same syndrome in adults and penned the term \\"upper airway resistance syndrome\\" (UARS) in adults. Finally, working in collaboration with Dr. William C. Dement, Guilleminault established the Apnea–hypopnea index (AHI), which is still in use today to characterize the presence and severity of sleep apnea. Guilleminault continued to be a prolific researcher in the field of sleep medicine until his death. He authored over seven hundred and forty (743) articles in peer-reviewed medical journals and won several awards for his research in the field of sleep medicine.Attribution of the Christian Guilleminault Award for Research in Sleep Medicine, World Association of Sleep Medicine (2005)Distinguished Scientist Award, Sleep Research Society (2005)Honorary professor, Department of Oto-laryngology, Medical Sciences School of the Capital University, Beijing, China (2005)Life Achievement Award, National Sleep Foundation (2005)Doctor \\"Honoris Causa\\", University of Liege (School of Medicine) (Belgium) (2004) He was a founding member of the Association of Sleep Disorders Centers in 1975 and was elected as the first editor of the journal Sleep in June 1976, a role in which he continued to serve until 1997.

In spite of a well-organized rescue effort led by the newly created Bureau of Mines, 84 miners died as a result of the explosion. The likely cause of the explosion was the ignition of dust and gas released by a roof fall. At least 22 of the miners killed in the Cross Mountain Mine disaster were buried in a circular memorial known as the Cross Mountain Miners' Circle, which is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Geographical setting View along Slatestone Rd. from its junction with TN-116 in Briceville, with Cross Mountain rising in the distance Cross Mountain is a massive ridge situated along the eastern Cumberland Plateau just west of the plateau's Walden Ridge escarpment, in the coal-rich Cumberland Mountains. Rising to an elevation of , the mountain is the highest point in Tennessee west of the Blue Ridge Province. The mountain is located along the border between Anderson County and Campbell County. Coal Creek, a tributary of the Clinch River, flows northward along the southeastern base of Cross Mountain, slicing a narrow valley in which the communities of Briceville and Fraterville are located. The town of Rocky Top, formerly Lake City and before that Coal Creek, is located near the creek's confluence with the Clinch, at the base of the Cumberland Plateau. Slatestone Creek, which flows westward down the slopes of Cross Mountain, empties into Coal Creek at Briceville. Slatestone Creek drains a narrow valley known as Slatestone Hollow, which runs perpendicular to the Coal Creek Valley. The Cross Mountain Mine was located at the western end of Slatestone Hollow, just over west of Briceville.\\"National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for Cross Mountain Miners' Circle,\\" October 2005. Section 8, pp. 5-6. Retrieved: 1 April 2008. Explosion and recovery efforts Officials gathered at the mine's main entrance following the explosion Major mining operations began at the Cross Mountain Mine in 1888, when a railroad spur line was extended up the Coal Creek Valley and into Slatestone Hollow. Over the years, large amounts of volatile coal dust had accumulated in the mine's shafts. On the morning of December 9, 1911, a roof fall occurred near one of the mine's entrances, which released methane gas into the air. The gas and coal dust probably ignited when a miner approached the roof fall with an open light. The explosion killed or trapped the 89 miners who had gone into the mine that morning.Tony VanWinkle, National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for Cross Mountain Miners' Circle, October 2005. Retrieved: 16 February 2010.Coal Creek Watershed Foundation, \\"Cross Mountain Mine Disaster and Rescue,\\" 2000-2008. Retrieved: 1 April 2008. A crowd consisting of miners' families and curious onlookers quickly gathered at the Cross Mountain Mine as miners and engineers immediately initiated a rescue operation. A ventilation fan was brought from a nearby mine and used to expel the afterdamp and force air into the mine shafts. A rescue crew from the Bureau of Mines which had been created the previous year arrived at around noon equipped with gas masks and oxygen tanks. This team was the first mine rescue team to use caged canaries to detect dangerous changes in air quality.Bob Fowler, \\"Centennial of Briceville's Cross Mountain Mine Disaster Remembered,\\" Knoxville News Sentinel, 4 December 2011. Retrieved: 9 December 2011. Water was piped into the mine from a nearby brook, allowing the Bureau crews to extinguish fires and erect brattices. Around midnight, the first three bodies were brought out of the mine. Two bodies were recovered the following day. On Monday, rescue workers followed miners' inscriptions to an area where five miners had barricaded themselves with several tubs of drinking water. Two of the miners were burned, and two had left the barricaded area to find a way out, although all five were found alive. On December 19, the last two miners Alonzo Wood and Eugene Ault were found dead behind another barricade. Before suffocating, Ault and Wood managed to inscribe \\"farewell\\" messages to their families on the barricade wall. Aftermath The Cross Mountain Mine operation was one of the first major rescue efforts carried out by the Bureau of Mines. Although only 5 of the 89 miners trapped by the explosion were rescued, the bureau collected invaluable information that aided later mine rescue efforts. The rescue effort also helped the bureau's public image, and ensured continued funding in the future. The 84 miners killed as a result of the explosion were buried in several cemeteries in the Briceville-Fraterville area. At least 22 were buried in a circular memorial which became known as the Cross Mountain Miners' Circle. This circle is located at the south end of Briceville on the steep western slope of Walden Ridge. Shortly after the disaster, the United Mine Workers of America placed a marble obelisk in the middle of the Cross Mountain Miners' Circle containing the names of all 84 miners killed in the Cross Mountain Mine disaster.\\"National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for Cross Mountain Miners' Circle,\\" October 2005. Section 7, p. 1. Retrieved: 1 April 2008. This memorial, around which a large cemetery has developed, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

Chilean women's societal roles have historically been impacted by traditional gender roles and a patriarchal culture, but throughout the twentieth century, women increasingly involved themselves in politics and protest, resulting in provisions to the constitution to uphold equality between men and women and prohibit sex discrimination. Women's educational attainment, workforce participation, and rights have improved, especially since Chile became a democracy again in 1990. Chile legalized divorce in 2004 and is also one of the few countries to have elected a female president. However, Chilean women still face many economic and political challenges, including income disparity, high rates of domestic violence, and lingering gender roles. History of women María de la Cruz, (1912–1995), Chilean political activist for women's suffrage, journalist, writer, and political commentator. In 1953, she became the first woman ever elected to the Chilean Senate Women were granted the right to vote in 1931 and 1949 during Chile's presidential era. Also during the era, thousands of women protested against socialist president Salvador Allende in the March of the Empty Pots and Pans. While under Augusto Pinochet's authoritarian regime, women also participated in las protestas, protests against Allende's plebiscite in which women voted \\"no.\\" During Chile's time under dictator Pinochet, the state of women's legal rights fell behind most of Latin America, even though Chile had one of the strongest economies in South America. Chile returned to democracy in 1990, leading to changes in women's lives and roles within society. Since the return to democracy, Chile's government has invested more political and economic resources to expand social welfare programs than before. The Concertación political party has been in power since the end of Pinochet's dictatorship, and from 2006 to 2010, Michelle Bachelet of the party served as the first female President of Chile. =Women in society= Chile has been described as one of the most socially conservative countries of Latin America. In comparison to the United States, Chile did not have so many feminists among its evolution of women's intrusion to the political sphere. Chilean women esteemed Catholicism as their rites of passage, which initiated women's movements in opposition to the liberal political party's eruption in the Chilean government. The traditional domesticated setting that women were accustomed to was used as a patriarchal reasoning for women's restriction of women's votes. However, Chileans religious convictions as devout Catholics initiated their desire to vote against the adamant anticlerical liberal party. In 1875, Domitila Silva Y Lepe, the widow of a former provincial governor, read the requirements deeming \\"all adult Chileans the right to vote\\", and was the first woman to vote. Other elitist Chilean women followed her bold lead, which resulted in the anticlerical liberal party of congress to pass a law denying women the right to vote. Despite this set back, Ms. Lepe and other elite women expressed their religious standings to the conservative party. The conservative party were favorable of the women because they knew their support would influence the conservative party's domination in politics. In 1912 Social Catholicism began to erupt. Social Catholicism- upper-class women's organization of working-class women-was led by Amalia Errazuriz de Subercaseaux. She introduced the Liga de Damas Chilenas (League of Chilean Ladies) amongst 450 other upper-middle-class women with intentions to \\"uphold and defend the interests of those women who worked for a living without attacking the principles of order and authority\\". Following this organization, many other elite women began socially constructed women's institutions. Amanda Labarca was also an elitist, but disagreed with the privileged women's subjection of working-class women and founded the ladies reading club. She believed women should be educated, regardless of their socioeconomic status to have a more influentially productive role in society. =Gender roles= Traditional gender role beliefs are prevalent in Chilean society, specifically the ideas that women should focus on motherhood and be submissive to men. A 2010 study by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reported that 62 percent of Chileans are opposed to full gender equality. Many of those surveyed expressed the belief that women should limit themselves to the traditional roles of mother and wife. However, the 2012 World Development Report states that male attitudes toward gender equality are that \\"men do not lose out when women's rights are promoted.\\" =Motherhood= Catholicism is embodied wholly among Chilean family identities. Virgin Mary is the idolized example of motherhood. Her pure and sacrificial acts are to be embodied by Chilean mothers. Traditionally, women are supposed to be the connoisseurs of endurance like the Virgin Mary. The biblical significance is portrayed through the traditional government of Chile. In the early 1900s, the gendered examples among Catholicism were embodied by the patriarchal government and suffrage of women. Women were domesticated and confined to the home. In the late 1940s women's issues were embraced by First Lady Rosa Markmann de González Videla in acknowledgement of Mothers centers, women gaining access to resources to fulfill their role as housewives, encouraged women as consumers to fight against high living costs, and to raise their interest in partaking in other avenues of public life within the country, such as work and political participation. The First Lady's efforts to advocate the evolution of women reform led to the modern techniques of the women reform. In the 1960s, campaigns for the Christian democrat, Frei, emphasized women and women's issues. Voting had just become mandatory for all Chileans and was the first time in history registration for female voters increased from thirty-five percent to seventy-five percent. The Christian democratic change of government opened women's access to birth control. However, the government's emphasis on the modernization of women institutions and underlying issues of gender hierarchy, women in poverty were neglected. Restrictions within the women's institutions, mother centers, restricted mothers under 18. To further structurally cripple Chilean women, first lady Maria Ruiz Tagle de Frei supervised \\"proper functioning\\" of feminist organizations. The Central Organization for Mothers (CEMA) was created as a formal structure to advise the underprivileged Chilean mothers. Carmen Gloria Aguayo revolutionized the mother's centers during the period of conflict between change and tradition during the Christian democrat campaign. Ms. Aguayo also headed the party's women's departments amongst forty-eight men and reflected the political direction of the initiatives: policies to protect the family- defending women's rights to work, to maternity leave, to equitable pay and occupation, a new opportunities for training and learning in the promised department for female labor studies. Because familial welfare was deemed important within the Chilean society, mothers have served as a political representation to have a voice in amongst the government. Legal rights Currently, women have many of the same rights as men. The National Women's Service (SERNAM) is charged with protecting women's legal rights in the public sector. =Marriage= Until recently, women lost their right to manage their own assets once they were married and husbands received all of the wealth, but that law has since changed and women can now administer their own assets. A couple can also sign a legal agreement before marriage so that all assets continue to be owned by the one who brought them into the marriage. The Chilean Civil Code previously mandated that wives had to live with and be faithful and obedient to their husbands, but it is no longer in the law. A married woman cannot be head of the household or head of the family in the same way as a man; however, married women are not required by law to obey their husbands. Divorce Chile legalized divorce in 2004, overturning an 1884 legal code. The law that legalizes divorce is the New Civil Marriage Law which was first introduced as a bill in 1995. There had been previous divorce bills before, but this one managed to secure enough conservative and liberal support to pass. With divorce now being legal, four marital statuses exist within Chile: married, separated, divorced, and widow (er). Only the divorced and widow (er) statuses allow a new marriage. Before the legalization of divorce, the only way to leave a marriage was to obtain a civil annulment which would only be granted by telling the civil registrar that the spouse had lied in some way concerning the marriage license, thereby voiding the marriage contract. =Property= In marriage, there are three types of assets: those of the husband, those of the wife, and the common assets that pertain to both. Land and houses in a marriage continue to be the property of the person who brought them to the marriage, but in order to sell them, both the husband and wife must sign. In the case of divorce, both the man and woman are entitled to ownership of the marital home. In the case of the death of a spouse, the surviving spouse, regardless of gender, has equal inheritance rights to the marital home. If there is no will when the husband dies, the wife is given an equal category as the children for inheritance. Before marriage, a couple can sign a legal document separating all assets so that the woman and man each administer her or his own; in this case, the husband cannot control his wife's assets. If women work outside the home independent of their husbands, acquire personal assets, and can prove that they came by these assets through their independent work, then these working women can accumulate these assets as their own, unable to be touched by husbands. Sons and daughters have equal inheritance rights to moveable and immovable property from their parents. Unmarried men and women have equal ownership rights to moveable and immoveable property. In rural Chile, inheritance is the principle way in which land is acquired by both men and women, whether the land has titles or not. Sometimes women cannot claim their inheritance to land without titles because the cost of legal documents is too high. =Suffrage= Women were granted the right to vote in municipal elections in 1931 and obtained the right to vote in national elections on January 8, 1949, resulting in their ability to vote under the same equal conditions as men and increasing women's participation in politics. =Family law= Both Chilean men and women qualify for a family allowance if they have dependent children under the age of eighteen (or twenty-four if in school). There are differences in entitlement requirements for the spouse- related family allowance since a man qualifies for a family allowance if he has a dependent wife, but a woman only qualifies for a family allowance if her husband is disabled. Until a reform of paternity laws in 1998, children born outside marriage had less right to parental financial support and inheritance than children born within marriage. A bill was passed in 2007 to give mothers direct access to child support payments. Working mothers of a certain low socioeconomic status and with proof of an employment contract and working hours receive subsidized child care through legislation passed in 1994. This system excludes: women whose household income is too high, unemployed women, women working in the informal sector, and women whose jobs are not by contract. Chile offers paid maternity leave for women working in the formal sector, paying women 100 percent of their salary during the leave, and also allows women a one-hour feeding break each day until the child has reached the age of two. Female workers unattached to the formal market and without an employment contract do not receive paid maternity leave. Postnatal maternity leave is now six months instead of the previous three. Education School girls running in the school yard Women's literacy rates almost match those of men, with 97.4 percent of women being able to read, versus 97.6 percent of men (in 2015).https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/fields/2103.html Chilean law mandates compulsory primary and secondary education for children, boys and girls. In 2007, the World Bank declared that enrollment levels for boys and girls in primary and secondary education were at a \\"virtual parity.\\" Women's education in Chile is generally higher than neighboring countries. In higher education, as of 2002, women had similar attendance rates as men, with women at 47.5 percent attendance, versus men at 52.5 percent. Employment =Participation= Chile has one of the lowest rate of female employment in all of Latin America, but women's workforce participation has steadily increased over the years. As of 2016, the employment rate of women was 52%. Despite the fact that 47.5% of students in college are women, many still choose to be homemakers rather than join the workforce. A 2012 World Bank study showed that the expansion of public day care had no effect on female labor force participation. The low number of women entering the labor force causes Chile to rank low amongst upper-middle class countries regarding women in the work force despite higher educational training. In Chile, poorer women make up a smaller share of the workforce. A 2004 study showed that 81.4 percent of women worked in the service sector. =Formal and informal work= Women have increasingly moved out of unpaid domestic work and into the paid formal and informal labor markets. Many female workers are in Chile's informal sector because national competition for jobs has increased the number of low-skill jobs. In 1998, 44.8 percent of working- aged women in Chile worked in the informal sector while only 32.9 percent of men worked informally. =Income gap= For jobs that do not require higher education, women make 20 percent less money on average than men. For jobs requiring a university degree, the gap in pay increases to 40 percent. Women without a university degree make 83 percent of the income men make without a university degree. The quadrennial 2004 National Socio-Economic Survey and World Bank report in 2007 say that the overall gender income gap stands at 33 percent (since women make 67 percent of men's salaries). Politics =Female participation in politics= Women were not involved in politics until 1934, when they could first use their municipal vote. The municipal, and later national, vote caused women to involve themselves in politics more than before, pressuring the government and political parties. With women's increased political importance, many parties established women's sections for support and tried to pursue women's votes, though it would take years for political parties to truly view women as important to politics. Chilean feminists gather in Santiago during Pinochet's regime Gladys Marín (1941–2005), Chilean activist and political figure. She was Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Chile (PCCh) (1994–2002) and then president of the PCCh until her death On December 1, 1971 thousands of women who were against the newly elected Salvador Allende marched through Santiago to protest government policies and Fidel Castro's visiting of Chile. This march, known as the March of the Empty Pots and Pans, brought together many conservative and some liberal women as a force in Chilean politics, and in 1977 Augusto Pinochet decreed the day of the march to be National Women's Day. Women also made their voices heard in the late 1980s when 52 percent of the national electorate was female, and 51.2 percent of women voted \\"no\\" in Augusto Pinochet's plebiscite. The women in these popular protests are considered to have played a central role in increasing national concern with the history of women's political activism. As of 2006, Chile was lower than eight other Latin American countries in regards to women in political positions. With only a few women legislators, sustaining attention to the topic of women's rights a difficult task, especially in the Senate, where there are fewer female representatives than in the Chamber of Deputies. Unlike neighboring Argentina, where 41.6 percent of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies is made up of women, only 22,6 percent of Chile's lower house is made up of female representatives. Chile has no government mandate requiring that women must make up a certain percentage of party candidates. Women's political representation is low but is on the rise in many political parties, and there is growing support for a quota law concerning women's representation. The progressive parties of the Left have greater openness to the participation of women, evident in the Party for Democracy's and Socialist Party's quotas for women's representation as candidates for internal party office. In 2009, activists demanded that presidential candidates develop reforms that would improve work conditions for women. Reforms included maternity leave, flexible work schedules and job training. Aimed at improving women's work opportunities, former president Michelle Bachelet made it illegal to ask for a job applicants' gender on applications and for employers to demand pregnancy tests be taken by employees in the public sector. =Second Wave Feminism= Following these Chilean women, the contemporary phase of feminism was constructed through the social conflict between socialism and feminism. The democratically elected president, Allende, was ousted on September 11, 1973 when a military coup invaded his palace, brutally excising all Popular Unity Government officials and resulting in Allende's debated suicide. This revolution \\"The Chilean Road to Socialism\\" abruptly came to an end, revitalizing the foundation of the government. However, the foundation was hastily corrupted by patriarchal values. Prominent feminist sociologist Maria Elena Valenzuela argued, the military state can be interpreted as the quintessential expression of patriarchy: \\"The Junta, with a very clear sense of its interests, has understood that it must reinforce the traditional family, and the dependent role of women, which is reduced to that of mother. The dictatorship, which institutionalizes social inequality, is founded on inequality in the family.\\" These inequalities began to agitate Chilean women. Women began to formulate groups opposing the patriarchal domination of the political sphere. =Michelle Bachelet's presidency= Michelle Bachelet was the first female president of Chile, leading the country between 2006 and 2010. During her presidency, Bachelet increased the budget of the National Women's Service (Servicio Nacional de la Mujer, SERNAM) and helped the institution gain funding from the United Nations Development Fund for Women. Her administration had an active role in furthering opportunities and policies for and about women, creating or improving child care, pension reform and breastfeeding laws. During her presidency, Bachelet appointed a cabinet that was 50 percent female. Bachelet served as the first executive director of United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. On March 11, 2014, she became president of Chile for the second time. =Policy= The National Women's Service (SERNAM) has noticed that it is easier to get politicians to support and pass poverty-alleviation programs aimed at poor women than proposals that challenge gender relations. Much of Chile's legislation concerning women's rights has been pushed by SERNAM: Between 1992 and 2010, sixty-four legislative proposals to expand women's legal equality were introduced by SERNAM. Historically the progressive parties of the Left have drawn more attention to women's rights. Yet many political parties insincerely support women's agenda and the concept of gender equality, instead leaving any action to be taken by SERNAM or nongovernmental organizations. Although SERNAM exists to aid women, there is no non- discrimination clause in the Political Constitution of the Republic of Chile. Organizations =State= The National Women's Service is the political institution created in 1991 that crafts executive bills concerning women's rights. Its Spanish name is Servicio Nacional de la Mujer, or SERNAM; it has established a program to aid female heads of households, a program for prevention of violence against women, and a network of information centers that focus on the issues of women's rights. Its presence in Chile is important because it was established by law and is a permanent part of Chile's state structure. As an institution it tends to focus much of its attention on certain segments of women: low-income women heads of households, women seasonal workers, domestic violence prevention, and teen pregnancy prevention. A common complaint that SERNAM has is that the top appointees are not women linked to the feminist community. The institution also has restrictions when it comes to policy regarding women due to its state ties, as seen in 2000 when SERNAM favored but would not explicitly support the bill to legalize divorce because it was under the leadership of the Christian Democratic party. In 2002 it was finally allowed to support the bill. =Research and activism= International Women's Day march in San Antonio, Chile Many of Chile's women's groups function outside the state sphere. Centers for research began to emerge in the later part of the twentieth century, including the Centro de Estudios de la Mujer (The Women's Study Center) and La Morada. The Women's Study Center is a nonprofit organization founded in 1984 and conducts research, trains women, has a consulting program, and tries to increase women's political participation. La Morada is another nonprofit organization that works to expand the rights of women through political involvement, education, culture, and efforts to eradicate violence. =International relations= Chile ratified the United Nation's Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1988, internationally declaring support for women's human rights. One of Chile's missions as part of the UN is commitment to democracy, human rights and gender perspective as foundations of multilateral action. Crimes against women = Domestic violence = Domestic violence in Chile is a serious issue affecting a large percentage of the population, especially among lower income demographics.Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Chile. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (March 6, 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The Intrafamily Violence Law passed in 1994 was the first political measure to address violence in the home, but because the law would not pass without being accepted by both sides, the law was weak in the way it addressed victim protection and punishment for abusers. The law was later reformed in 2005.http://www.cepal.org/oig/doc/Chi200520066ModificaLeyVIF1994.pdf A 2004 SERNAM study reported that 50 percent of married women in Chile had suffered spousal abuse, 34 percent reported having suffered physical violence, and 16 percent reported psychological abuse. According to another study from 2004, 90 percent of low-income women in Chile experience some type of domestic violence. Due to the high prevalence of domestic violence, many Chilean women accept it as normal. The legalization of divorce in 2004 won the approval of women throughout the country, especially those concerned about domestic violence, as women were previously unable to escape abusive relationships due to the divorce laws. From January to November 2005, 76,000 cases of family violence were reported to the Carabineros; 67,913 were reported by women, 6,404 by men, and approximately 1,000 by children. = Rape = Rape, including spousal rape, is a criminal offense. Penalties for rape range from five to 15 years' imprisonment, and the government generally enforces the law. In 2004 the Criminal Code was changed so that the age for statutory rape is 14; previously, the age was 12. The law protects the privacy and safety of the person making the charge. In 2006 from January to November, police received reports of 1,926 cases of rape, compared with 2,451 cases in all of 2005; experts believed that most rape cases go unreported. The Ministry of Justice and the PICH have several offices specifically to provide counseling and assistance in rape cases. A number of NGOs, such as La Morada Corporation for Women, provide counseling for rape victims. = Sexual harassment = A 2005 law against sexual harassment provides protection and financial compensation to victims and penalizes harassment by employers or co-workers. The law provides severance pay to anyone who resigns due to being a victim of sexual harassment if she/he has worked for the employer for at least one year. During 2005 the Labor Directorate received 244 complaints of sexual harassment, and in 2009 there were 82 complaints were received. The majority of the complaints come from women. = Discrimination = A 2005 study by Corporacion Humana and the University of Chile's Institute of Public Affairs revealed that 87 percent of women surveyed felt that women suffered discrimination. According to the survey, 95 percent believed women faced discrimination in the labor market, 67 percent believed they faced discrimination in politics, 61 percent felt that women were discriminated against by the media, and 54 percent within the family. Other concerns =Family= Today, younger women are opting out of marriage and having fewer children than their predecessors. The total fertility rate as of 2015 was 1.82 children born/woman. This is below the replacement rate of 2.1, and also lower than in previous years. A 2002 study reported that urban women averaged 2.1 children per woman, with women living in rural areas having more children, at 2.9. As of the 1990s, both urban and rural women were averaging fewer children than previously. For those women who do have children, after former president Michelle Bachelet's childcare mandates, childcare centers that provide free services are four times more numerous. Nursing mothers also have the legal right to breastfeed during the workday. Women are less likely to seek divorces and marriage annulments. =Health and sexuality= Women in Chile have long life expectancy, living an average of 80.8 years, about six years longer than men. Sex education is rarely taught in schools and is considered \\"taboo\\" by many Chilean families. Friends and family usually are the main source of sex education. In 1994, Chile decriminalized adultery.Women and Democracy: Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe, edited by Jane S. Jaquette, Sharon L. Wolchik, page 62 HIV/AIDS The HIV/AIDS rate in Chile was estimated in 2012 at 0.4% of adults aged 15–49. While cases of HIV and AIDS in women have stabilized internationally, Chile has seen a rise in HIV/AIDS infection. Societal beliefs about traditional women's roles as mothers leads to women being less likely to use contraceptives, increasing the opportunity for disease. Chilean women also often feel subordinate to men due to these traditional belief systems, making women less likely to negotiate for the use of condoms. In 2007, 28 percent of people with HIV/AIDS in Chile were women. Numbers of women living with HIV is lower than those with AIDS. A study by Vivo Positivo showed that 85 percent of women living with HIV/AIDS reported that they had little to no education or information about HIV/AIDS until diagnosis. A 2004 study found that Chilean women with HIV/AIDS were susceptible to coerced sterilization. Fifty-six percent of HIV-positive Chilean women reported being pressured by health-care workers to prevent pregnancy by being sterilized. Of the women who chose to be sterilized, half were forced or persuaded to do so. Women victims of domestic abuse face a higher risk of getting HIV, and in 2004, 56 percent of women who have HIV and 77 percent of women with HIV/AIDS were victims of domestic abuse, sexual abuse, or rape before their diagnosis. Abortion Between 1989 and 2017, Chile had some of the strictest abortion laws in the world, banning the procedure completely.\\"Chile abortion: Court approves easing total ban\\" at BBC News. The current law allows abortion if the mother's life in danger, in case of lethal malformations of the fetus, or in cases of rape.http://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/publicaciones/2017/09/23/41866/01/1276248.pdf Notable Chilean women Gabriela Mistral, the first Latin American woman to win a Nobel Prize for Literature.

Its population was 130 as of the 2010 census. Mercersville lies at an elevation of 341 feet (104 m).  History  The community of Mercersville, more popularly known today as Taylor's Landing, is located on the third land patent surveyed in what would eventually become Washington County, Maryland. Maj. Edward Sprigg's \\"Sprigg's Delight\\" would eventually encompass much of the land from here to near Sharpsburg, but the original is noted in the 1734 survey as \\"below the fording place of Charles Anderson.\\"MSA S1203-48 (Maryland State Archives) Patent certificate 2040 Prince George's County Land Records. Charles Anderson received a patent in Terrapin Neck on the Virginia side of the Potomac this same year. A court order for a new road in 1838 refers to the location as \\"Zook's Landing.\\" Since the C&O; Canal was still under construction at the time and had only reached the area a few years earlier, it is thought this is a reference to the area being used by boatmen of the earlier Patomack Company.MSA c2201-000001 page 228 Further evidence pointing to a Patowmack Company port is that Henry Zook, operator of Zook's Landing, died in 1825, before the canal was incorporated. He is buried at Salem Lutheran Church cemetery at nearby Bakersville. There remains today an ancient iron ring affixed to the bedrock between the boat ramps at Taylor's Landing, long rumored to be a relic of the Patomack Company days. After the establishment of the C&O; Canal the area became locally important as both a shipping and receiving point as well as the home port of many boatmen who lived nearby. The name Mercersville was given in honor of Charles F. Mercer, the first president of the C&O; Canal Company. The popular name of Taylor's Landing is credited to John William \\"Jack\\" Taylor (1868-1948) who operated a store adjacent to the wharf for many years. During the mid to late 19th century, many of the residents of Bakersville 1 1/2 miles away are listed as employed on the canal. Closer, on a now lost road between Bakersville and Mercersville was the community of Dogtown. Today's Tommytown road skirts the edge of historic Dogtown, passing the remaining four of what was originally more than ten houses populated mostly by Canal workers and boatmen. The potomac River at Taylor's Landing has long been a favorite fishing spot, evidenced by the several ancient native stone structures known locally as \\"fish pots\\" still visible in the river. During the mid-20th century the area became popular for weekend cottages as well as a Rod & Gun Club, now a multi- unit residence at 1700 Taylor's Landing road. In 1972 the National Park Service was authorized to expand the boundaries of the C&O; Canal park and most of these small cabins were bought and eventually razed. Along with both earlier and later homes, several examples of these weekend cottages remain in near original form at Taylor's Landing, providing a glimpse at a later chapter to the history of this place. Today Taylor's Landing, aka Mercersville, is a rural village of mostly single family residential homes and primarily known for the C&O; Canal access site and Potomac River boat ramp located here. Geography According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the community has an area of , all land.

The present building dates from shortly after 1583. One of three buildings in Nantwich to be listed at grade I, the listing describes the Crown Hotel as \\"an important late C16 building.\\" The existing hotel was built on the site of an earlier inn of the same name, destroyed in the Great Fire of Nantwich of 1583. This appears to have been constructed on an earlier industrial site, including a medieval tannery and an 11–12th century salt working. The area has also been speculated to have been the location of Nantwich Castle. Archaeological findings It has been speculated that the site, which forms a high point in the town adjacent to the river, might have been the location of Nantwich Castle, which was built before 1180. Excavations behind the Crown Hotel in 1978 found evidence of terracing, perhaps representing a platform or mound, as well as a pre-medieval ditch, which might have formed the outer bailey of the castle. Roman pottery was also found in these excavations, including Samian ware and roof tiles.McNeil Sale R. et al., pp. ? The excavations of 1978 found medieval leather shoes and numerous leather offcuts, suggesting a tannery was located on the site during this period. A D-shaped oak timber was found which might have formed part of a tanning bench, as well as wooden bowls and platters and medieval pottery. Large amounts of burnt charcoal, coal and clay dating from the early post- Medieval period were uncovered; they are believed to represent an 11–12th century salt working on the site. History Carved corbel The Crown was formerly the principal inn of Nantwich. Landlord Roger Crockett was murdered in a brawl on 19 December 1572, in a case that involved many of the town's gentry and was heard in the Star Chamber.Lake, p. 51 The original \\"Crowne\\" was one of seven inns destroyed in the Great Fire of Nantwich of 1583. The proprietor at the time of the fire was Robert Crockett.Hall, p. 105 The present building is known to have been rebuilt shortly after the date of the fire.Pevsner & Hubbard, p. 287 The cost of £313 13s 4d was the greatest of all the buildings rebuilt at that time; £240 was contributed by Crockett.Lake, pp. 119–20 The rebuilt Crown was a coaching inn on the Chester to London road.Simpson, plate 93 During the Civil War, the inn was used as a place of worship, while the parish church was a prison.Hall, p. 167 The Duke of Monmouth dined at the Crown in 1682. During part of the 18th century, the inn was known as the \\"Crown and Sceptre\\".Hall, p. 221Garton, p. 12 The \\"Crown Inn Lodge\\", Nantwich's second Masonic Lodge, was founded in 1794 by Sir Robert Salusbury Cotton, MP for the county of Cheshire, and presumably met at the Crown; it had 28 members in 1799.Garton, p. 28 Plays were put on in the inn's assembly room until a theatre was built in the early 19th century.Hall, p. 218Garton, p. 19 The Crown is described in an 1874 directory as a \\"Commercial Inn and Posting House\\", one of two in the town (the other being the Lamb Hotel on Hospital Street).Morris & Co's Directory, p. 302 (1874) The Crown was run by the Piggott family for over 30 years from the late 1870s. Thomas Piggott, landlord in 1881, was the great grandfather of well-known jockey Lester Piggott.Boyd, p. 45 Description Second storey, showing continuous windows and overhang The Crown Hotel is a black-and-white, timber-framed and plaster three-storey building with a tiled roof. The street-facing front, described by Nikolaus Pevsner as \\"impressive\\", is flat and features close studding with a middle rail. Unlike many buildings of a similar date in the town, it lacks ornamental panelling.McKenna, p. 18 Each storey has small overhangs, with carved corbels (brackets). All three storeys have restored mullioned and transomed windows in oak. The second (top) floor features unusual continuous windows along the entire front.Bethell, p. 204 To the left of the street front is a covered passage known as Crown Mews, which was the entrance to the inn's stables at the rear. On the left of the passage is a recessed shop front; formerly a coffee shop, as of 2009 it houses a jeweller's. The interior is in good condition. The ground floor features an 18th-century enclosed bar and a wall panel showing the original wattle and daub construction. A large beam supported by scrollwork forms an archway to the rear, where there is an 18th- century assembly room. An iron mantrap is mounted on the wall to the rear of the archway. The second storey was originally a single gallery and was partitioned, probably in the 18th century. Modern hotel As of 2009, the Crown is an eighteen-bedroom hotel and public house and restaurant. It renovated its restaurant to a grill restaurant in January 2016 and now serves a range of grilled meats, fish and other Great British dishes. The Crown is licensed for civil wedding ceremonies.

It is known for its numerous caves and remarkably high cliffs, reaching over 241 metres above normal water level and continuing below the water level. The total explored depth of this sinkhole is approximately 530 metres with a volume of roughly 25–30 million cubic meters, thus it is the third largest sinkhole in the world. Water drains out of the basin through underground waterways that descend below the level of the lake floor. The deepest known point of the lake is 4 meters below sea level. The sinkhole is named after the reddish-brown color of the surrounding cliffs, colored by iron oxides. Like the nearby Blue Lake, it is presumed that the lake emerged when the ceiling of a large cave hall collapsed. The lake is inhabited with endemic and endangered spotted minnow (Delminichthys adspersus). In the dry period of the year, this fish can be occasionally seen in surrounding springs, rivers and lakes, suggesting that there is an underground connection between Red Lake and other water bodies. At the 13th International Congress of Speleology in 2001, new findings were revealed. An inflow cave-shaped canal that measured approximately 30 x 30 meters was discovered in the eastern part of the lake at a depth of 175 meters. Legend According to the legend, written down by Fra Silvestar Kutleša, Imotski was a home of a greedy rich man Gavan and his wife () who had an infant son. They had two castles, the western one and the eastern one. One day, while Gavan was counting money in the western castle, Jesus, disguised as a beggar, came down to Earth to test Gavan and Gavanovica. He asked her, in the name of God, for some bread and cabbage. She rebelled to the God's name but reluctantly agreed to feed the beggar. She told her servant to put the bread on her shoe, because she found it humiliating to give the bread to a beggar with her hands, and to cut some cabbage leaves that dogs urinated on but the servant didn't do so because he was religious and feared God. Jesus in disguise told the servant: \\"Tonight something shall happen, do not be afraid! Lightnings shall strike, earth shall quake, and lakes shall appear. None of that shall harm you.\\" Jesus went on to test Gavan's 77 shepherds and 77 serfs. Only two of them all had merciful hearts. He asked one of them in the name of God for some roasted lamb. The serf said he had only three lambs and nothing to feed his children with, but agreed to give some roasted lamb to the beggar. When he said he would go and get the lamb, Jesus stopped him saying: \\"Do not go! If your heart is like your tongue, the lamb shall come by itself!\\" And so it was, the lamb came out of the pen by itself and was slaughtered by the serf's wife. Before eating, Jesus told them not to throw away a single bone, and after eating he told them to put all the bones on one pile. The lamb then came back to life and went back to the pen. He asked another one for a handful of wool in the name of God, and the serf said he and his wife had nothing to wear but still agreed to give the beggar not only a handful of wool but a whole fleece. Jesus took the fleece, crossed it and disappeared leaving behind himself an entire stack of wool. That night Gavan stayed overnight in the western castle because he had so much money there that he couldn't count it in one day. Outside of the castle, dark clouds covered up the sky and coming down to the earth. It thundered and lightened above Zavelim and Biokovo. Thunders were shaking the walls of the western castle, God was giving Gavan the last chance to repent. Gavan didn't lift his eyes from the money — he believed in money, not God. Three earthquakes followed and earth opened up swallowing the west castle. In the place of the castle Red Lake appeared; it was round because the castle walls were round. In the east castle, Gavanovica was frightened by the wind, thunder, lightning and quaking. She was screaming her servants' names but no one responded as they valued their lives more than hers and went to save themselves. While she was screaming and crying, God told that good servant: \\"Take that bag that is hanging off the beam, inside of it you shall find all your payment. And run away now, all of this shall go into an abyss! Into downfall! This is a cursed house and a cursed place!\\" The servant took Gavan and Gavanovica's infant son because he was fond of him, and ran to save himself. The east castle was swallowed by earth and that's where Blue Lake was created. While he was running, the ground underneath his feet was collapsing. That's why Blue Lake is oval, not round like the Red one. When the servant arrived at Proložac, he heard a voice from the clouds telling him to throw the child. The servant obeyed God's words and threw him. Earth opened up once again and swallowed the child. Water rose from the place that the child was throwed at — today it is called the Utopišće Spring. The servant couldn't continue running because he was heartbroken by the act he committed but drew strength when God encouraged him: \\"Run further, don't mourn the child! The evil bloodline shall not have offspring!!!\\" The houses of all serfs and shepherds, except for the houses of those merciful serfs, had been swallowed by earth too, but were not sunken because God found them lesser guilty. All places where Gavan had haystacks, stables and pens were sunken, resulting in two lakes in Proložac, two ponds in Donji Vinjani and three lakes in Prološko Blato. Only the chickens had survived. The henhouse has in the meantime turned into rock and got covered by moss, blackberry and ivy.

It has been described as one of only three RRF (ridge-ridge-fault) triple junctions on Earth, besides the Azores Triple Junction and Chile Triple Junction. However, because the fault arm of such unstable triple junctions tend to evolve into a spreading centre, all three cases have quickly evolved into stable RRR triple junctions. Since a reorganisation of the involved tectonic plates the AOC moves in discrete steps westward along the Aden Ridge. West of the southern termination of the Owen fracture Zone, the Beautemps- Beaupré Basin, a new plate boundary develops and the basin will be transferred from the Arabian Plate to the Indian Plate in a near future. The Carlsberg Ridge was opened between the Seychelles and India in the Early Tertiary and has since undergone three stages of spreading. A first, fast stage with a half-rate spreading; a second ultra-slow () stage during the India-Eurasia collision; followed by the present slow () spreading which reaches in its northern end. This latest stage was initiated by the opening of the Gulf of Aden during which the Aden Ridge began to quickly propagate westward at a rate of /Ma. The Owen Fracture Zone, together with the Dalrymple Trough in its northern end, is a transform fault along which spreading between the Arabian and Indian Plates at the Carlsberg Ridge becomes the subduction of the Himalayan orogeny. The Owen Fracture Zone passes east of the Owen Ridge which was uplifted during the opening of the eastern Gulf of Aden in the Early Miocene. North of the Aden-Owen-Carlsberg Triple Junction the Owen Fracture Zone is quiet for but right-lateral slip along its active segments indicates that Arabia is moving northward faster than India. The relative motion between the Nubian and Somalian plates before 3.2 Ma is difficult to determine since the movement in the Southwest Indian Ridge is extremely slow. Analysing the Aden-Owen-Carlsberg Triple Junction, however, geologists have been able to determine that before 11 Ma the Nubia-Somalia relative motion was faster than today and contained a significant strike-slip component.

He was from a prominent Shia family of Basra. Many members of his family were the agents of previous Imams of Shia. Before Minor Occultation he was the deputy of Ali al-Hadi, the tenth Imam of Shia and Hasan al-Askari the eleventh Imam of Shia. The deputing period When Husayn ibn Ruh al-Nawbakhti, the third deputy, was about to die, he named al-Samari as the next and fourth deputy of twelfth Imam of Shia. Because of his family and his good record in the time of two previous Shia Imams amongst Shias, he faced no problem in his being accepted as the deputy by the Shia community. Due to unprecedented crackdown of Banu Abbas against Shias in the period of the deputy of Muhammad al-Sammari, he wasn't very active and had intentionally limited his interaction with his agents amongst Shias. The beginning of Major Occultation On the sixth day after receiving the letter, Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Muhammad al-Samarri died (939 AD) and he was buried in Baghdad near the current grave of Sheikh Kulayni. Before his death, they asked him about the next deputy and he responded: \\"I don't have permission to introduce anyone\\". Following his death, the Major Occultation began.

It is presently located in the museum complex in Dahlem, along with the Museum of Asian Art () and the Museum of European Cultures (). The museum holds more than 500,000 objects and is one of the largest and most important collections of works of art and culture from outside Europe in the world.Viola König (Hrsg.): Ethnologisches Museum Berlin. Prestel, München 2003. Seite 8. Its highlights include important objects from the Sepik River, Hawaii, the Kingdom of Benin, Cameroon, Congo, Tanzania, China, the Pacific Coast of North America, Mesoamerica, the Andes, as well as one of the first ethnomusicology collections of sound recordings (the Berliner Phonogramm-Archiv) The Ethnological Museum was founded in 1873 and opened its doors in 1886 as the Royal Museum for Ethnology (), but its roots go back to the 17th century Kunstkammer of the rulers of Brandenburg-Prussia.Viola König (Hrsg.): Ethnologisches Museum Berlin. Prestel, München 2003, S. 14. As the museum’s collections expanded in the early twentieth century, the museum quickly outgrew its facility in the center of Berlin on Königgrätzer Straße (today named Stresemannstraße).Viola König (Hrsg.): Ethnologisches Museum Berlin. Prestel, München 2003, S. 16. A new building was erected in Dahlem to house the museum’s store rooms and study collections. In the Second World War, the main building of the museum was heavily damaged. It was demolished in 1961, and the buildings in Dahlem (in what was then West Berlin) were reconfigured to serve as the museum’s exhibition spaces. Following German reunification, although many of the Berlin museum collections were relocated, the collections of the Ethnological Museum remained in Dahlem. Starting in 2000, concrete plans were developed to relocate the collections back to the center of the city. As a result, in 2019, the Ethnological Museum and Museum of Asian Art are scheduled to reopen in the Humboldt Forum in the reconstructed Berlin City Palace () immediately south of the main Museum Island complex. Collections Beginning in January 2016, the Ethnological Museum began the process of dismantling its exhibitions in preparation for its move to the Humboldt Forum. Until January 2017, the museum will remain open to the public, and its permanent exhibitions of works from Africa, Mesoamerican archaeology, and South Asia can still be viewed. Highlights include the collections of painted Maya vases and drinking cups, Benin bronzes, sculpture from Cameroon, and power figures from Congo. The collections themselves encompass more than 500,000 from around the world. In addition, the museum holds more than 280,000 historical photographs, a substantial archive, more than 125,000 sound recordings, and 20,000 ethnographic films. The collection is organized according to geography as well as methodological approaches. The main divisions are Africa, Oceania, East-and North-Asia, South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Central Asia, American ethnology, American archaeology, and ethnomusicology. The museum also houses a specialized reference library of more than 140,000 volumes relating to ethnology, non-European art, and global art. These collections are all housed in the museum complex in Dahlem. Long- term plans are being made to relocate the collections not on display to Friedrichshagen, an eastern suburb of Berlin, where the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation () has already constructed storage facilities for the Berlin State Library ().

The museum's first building in the center of Berlin on Königgrätzer Straße (now Stresemannstraße at the corner with Niederkirchnerstraße) was already too small to accommodate the collections when it opened in 1886. The situation deteriorated further in the last years of the nineteenth century, as the collections expanded rapidly because of increased institutional support for ethnology and the growth of the German overseas colonial empire after the Berlin Conference. Entrance of the Bruno Paul building on Arnimallee By 1906, the first construction began on a second facility for the museum in Dahlem. The museum intended to use space in Dahlem to store and conduct research on the large collections, but to continue to exhibit portions of the collection in the building in the city center. Plans were developed for a large complex in Dahlem, consisting of four large buildings, one for each of the non- European geographical regions of the globe: Asia, Africa, Oceania, and the Americas, the latter department directed by Konrad Theodor Preuss. Construction began in 1914, the architect Bruno Paul was commissioned to build the structure to house the Asian collections on Arnimallee, Dahlem. The work was stopped, however, because of the First World War and was only completed in 1921. However, the museum lacked the resources to erect the other three planned buildings. The museum continued to function with two separate facilities housing its collections until the Second World War. Following the Second World War, as a result of the division of Berlin, the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation decided to house the portions of the Gemäldegalerie (Picture Gallery) that were returned to West Berlin in the Bruno Paul building. This decision required moving the collections of the Ethnological Museum to a new facility. The architect Fritz Bornemann developed plans for an extension to the Bruno Paul building, which was erected from 1966 to 1970. The Bornemann building faced onto Lansstraße with an uncompromisingly modernist pavilion and contrasted sharply with the older neo-classical Bruno Paul structure, with its main entrance on Arnimallee.

Leatherneck is a military slang term for a member of the United States Marine Corps, or of the Corps of Royal Marines. It is generally believed to originate in the wearing of a leather \\"stock\\" or collar around the neck, which kept the posture erect. History The term \\"leatherneck\\" was derived from a leather stock once worn around the neck by both American and British Marines and soldiers. In the United States, beginning in 1798, \\"one stock of black leather and clasp\\" was issued to each Marine every year. Its use as a synecdoche for Marines began as a term of ridicule by sailors. The dress blue uniform of the US Marines still bears a tribute to that stock collar today, with its stiff cloth collar. Leather neck collar This stiff leather collar, fastened by two buckles at the back, measured between 2.5 and more than 3 inches tall in front, tapering toward the back. The origin of the leather neck collar, also known as a \\"stock\\", has to do with early 19th-century military fashion trends in Europe and North America; its use among enlisted men supposedly improved their military bearing and appearance by forcing the chin high and posture straight. The stock was uncomfortable, but Marines would be punished for failure to wear them on duty, so some would have the stock stitched to their coats to ensure it was always on their uniform. General George F. Elliott, recalling its use after the American Civil War, said the \\"effect of the stock when buckled around a man's neck was to hold his head high in the air, like geese looking for rain\\". The stock was dropped as an article of American Marine uniform in 1872, after surviving through the uniform changes of 1833, 1839, and 1859.USMC uniforms during the Civil War. Marine Corps Association =As protection= While the stock is understood to have been worn only for posture, legend tells that it was worn to protect the neck from sword cuts, such as cutlass slashes while boarding ships. The leather stock was adopted three years prior to the Barbary War in which United States Marines first fought North African troops armed with scimitars. This is disputed as leather is not considered adequate protection against a striking object. On Royal Naval vessels of the 18th & 19th Century, Royal Marines acted as the Ships guard. Additionally, as Marksmen firing from the rigging during sea engagements, shore detachments, landing parties, etc. Commanded by a Marine officer, and their own NCO's; these Men were a sub-group within the Ships company, and not part of the crew. This was a deliberate segregation, as Marines were responsible for safeguarding supplies, firearms, and Naval Officers from their crew. Most British sailors of the era were press-ganged into service, whereas a Marine enlisted. Trusted by the Navy command, disliked by the Sailors as the guardians of Authority. A thick, stiff leather collar provided protection for a Marine Sentry from having their throat cut by mutineers. Hence the derogatory term used by Sailors to describe a Marine: leatherneck. Alternative etymology for Royal Marines While the American Marine Corps nickname \\"leatherneck\\" is generally attributed to the wear of the leather stock, some argue that the use of the term for British Royal Marines is not based on that garment, but instead on the tough and \\"leathery\\" nature of a weathered and unwashed neck, noting that \\"bootneck\\" is also a British slang term for a marine.

Overview The situation of the troops, who had been cut off from their advance into France by a pincer movement from the German army, was regarded by the British prime minister Winston Churchill as the greatest military defeat for centuries; it appeared likely to cost Britain the war, as the majority of the British Expeditionary Force was trapped, leaving the country vulnerable to invasion by Germany.Birkett, Peter. \\"Once more unto the beach for ships that saved an army\\", The Independent, 3 June 2000.\\"History\\", The Association of Dunkirk Little Ships, Retrieved 1 April 2008.Safire, William. Lend Me Your Ears: Great Speeches in History. W. W. Norton & Company, 2004, p. 146. Because of the shallow waters, British destroyers were unable to approach the beaches, and soldiers were having to wade out to the boats, many of them waiting hours in shoulder-deep water. On 27 May, the small-craft section of the British Ministry of Shipping telephoned boat builders around the coast, asking them to collect all boats with \\"shallow draft\\" that could navigate the shallow waters. Attention was directed to the pleasure boats, private yachts and launches moored on the River Thames and along the south and east coasts. Some of them were taken with the owners' permission – and with the owners insisting they would sail them – while others were requisitioned by the government with no time for the owners to be contacted. The boats were checked to make sure they were seaworthy, fuelled, and taken to Ramsgate to set sail for Dunkirk. They were manned by Royal Navy officers, ratings and experienced volunteers. Very few owners manned their own vessels, apart from fishermen and one or two others. When they reached France, some of the boats acted as shuttles between the beaches and the destroyers, ferrying soldiers to the warships. Others carried hundreds of soldiers each back to Ramsgate, protected by the Royal Air Force from the attacks of the Luftwaffe. According to the Association of Dunkirk Little Ships, the term \\"Little Ship\\" applies to all craft that were originally privately owned and includes commercial vessels such as barges, fishing vessels and pleasure steamers; the Association does include some ex-Service vessels, which are now privately owned, and ex-lifeboats. Notable boats *Royal Daffodil II – not to be confused with the smaller paddle steamer ferry which also went to Dunkirk, this vessel owned by the General Steam Navigation Company of London evacuated 7,461 service personnel from Dunkirk in five trips between 28 May and 2 June, among them the French historian Marc Bloch, who served as a French army captain in the campaign. This was the largest number evacuated by a single passenger vessel in the operation. On 2 June, she was attacked by six German aircraft. A bomb dropped by one of them penetrated two of her decks and blew a hole below the water line, but she managed to limp back to port. *Medway Queen – the paddle steamer made the most round trips – seven – rescuing 7,000 men and earning herself the nickname \\"Heroine of Dunkirk\\". Restored and rededicated in 2013, she can now be visited at the Gillingham Pier in Kent. *Massey Shaw – the London-based fireboat initially went to Dunkirk to help fight fires, however it ended up making three trips across the channel rescuing over 500 troops, including 30 troops from the Emil de Champ which had hit a mine in the Channel. *Sundowner – a motor yacht owned by Charles Lightoller, former second officer of the Titanic, was requisitioned by the Admiralty on 30 May. Lightoller insisted that, if anyone was going to take her to Dunkirk, it would be him and his eldest son, Roger, together with Sea Scout Gerald Ashcroft. The men transported 127 soldiers back to Ramsgate, reportedly packed together like sardines, almost capsizing when they reached the shore.\\"Sundowner.\\" The Association of Dunkirk Little Ships. Retrieved 1 April 2008. She is a museum ship at the Ramsgate Maritime Museum. *Bluebird of Chelsea – the yacht made two round trips to Kent, carrying hundreds of men. *Tamzine – a fishing boat less than in length; the smallest boat to take part in the evacuation and now preserved by the Imperial War Museum. *Marchioness – built in 1923, in 1989 she was involved in a collision with Bowbelle on the River Thames with the loss of 51 lives. * – a 6,900-ton cargo ship from Glasgow. It was the largest merchant vessel used during the evacuation, and was sunk off the beach on 29 May. As it sank, it happened to settle evenly to the bottom in shallow water with the decks above water, and thereafter served as an unintentional decoy target for German Stuka dive-bombers. The British Admiralty later estimated the Clan MacAlister saved over a million pounds (sterling) worth of shipping. *Firefly - a 26 ft wooden motor yacht, built in 1923 by Cole & Wiggins Ltd. of Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. In May 1940 Firefly was under the charge of Commander Bowen. Corporal Denis Kinnell (1918-2008) was one of those rescued from Dunkirk in 1940 by Commander Bowen and Firefly. =RNLI lifeboats at Dunkirk= See also individual stations for more information in many cases. * Abdy Beauclerk (ON 751), a lifeboat from Aldeburgh Lifeboat Station No.1 Station. * Cecil and Lilian Philpott (ON 730), a Watson-class lifeboat from Newhaven, Sussex.

However, numerous ships from the fishing fleet and small Corps de Marine were involved in Operation Dynamo. In total, 65 Belgian ships participated, including 54 fishing boats, 4 Corps de Marine units, 4 tugs and 2 patrol vessels. The Belgian fishing fleet itself transported 4,300 British and French soldiers to the English coast. Among the notable Belgian ships to participate in the evacuation were: *Patrol vessel A5 Belgian ship H75 Results In nine days, 192,226 British and 139,000 French soldiers – more than 331,000 total – were rescued by the 700 little ships and around 220 warships. The rescue operation turned a military disaster into a story of heroism which served to raise the morale of the British. It was in describing the success of the operation to the House of Commons on 4 June 1940 that Churchill made his famous \\"we shall fight on the beaches\\" speech: > We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the > seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength > in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall > fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight > in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall > never surrender ...Churchill, Winston. \\"We shall fight on the beaches\\", > House of Commons, 4 June 1940.

Mayo entered public life as a political writer advocating White Anglo-Saxon Protestant Nativism, opposition to non- white and Catholic immigration to the United States, and opposition to recently emancipated African slave laborers. She became known for denouncing the Philippine Declaration of Independence on racialist and religious grounds, then went on to publish and promote her best-known work, Mother India (1927), wherein she opposed Indian Independence from British rule. Her work was well received in British government circles and among American Anglophile racialists, but was criticized by others for notorious racism and Indophobia. Biography Mayo was born in Ridgway, Pennsylvania, to James Henry and Harriet Elizabeth (Ingraham) Mayo, and was educated privately. Shortly after graduation, she started work as a researcher and historian by helping Oswald Garrison Villard of the New York Evening Post (whose father owned the newspaper) prepare his book John Brown 1800–1859: A Biography Fifty Years After, a biography of John Brown, which was published in 1910. Villard was a founder of the American Anti-Imperialist League and an officer of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He influenced Mayo to become a social reformer. Mayo also became a member of the Mayflower Society and had cordial links with the Daughters of the American Revolution. The latter were hostile to non-white immigration to the United States at the time, believing the country to rightfully belong to white Anglo Saxons of British descent and Protestant faith. Several of Mayo's early writings promoted anti- Catholicism and hostility to non-white independence movements against European colonial rule. Mayo combined anti-Catholicism and Anti-Filipino sentiment in her writings that opposed the independence of the Philippines from American rule. Mayo's early journalistic works celebrated the Anglo-Saxon \\"racial character\\" of American nationalism and promoted xenophobia against Irish Catholic immigrants, as well as increasingly prominent African American laborers. Mayo claimed that \\"negroes\\" were sexually aggressive and lacked self-control, thus rendering them a threat to \\"innocent white Anglo-Saxon women\\". Mayo put her highly effective writing skills behind the effort to establish the New York State Police and supported their ability to control immigrants and blacks whose involvement in labor rights agitations were viewed by Mayo as a threat to white supremacy.  Mother India  Mayo became notorious for her polemical book Mother India (1927), in which she attacked Hindu society and religion, and the culture of India. Critics of Mayo accuse her works of being racist, pro-imperialist and Indophobic tracts that \\"expressed all the dominant prejudices of colonial society. Conversely, supporters cited the truth of her first-hand observations The book created a sensation on three continents.Mrinalini Sinha: \\"Introduction\\". In: Sinha (ed.): Selections from Mother India. Women's Press, New Delhi 1998. Written against the demands for self-rule and Indian independence from the British Raj, Mayo alluded to the treatment of India's women, the Dalits, the animals, the dirt and the character of its nationalistic politicians. Mayo singled out what she perceived to be the \\"rampant\\" and fatally weakening sexuality of its males to be at the core of all problems, leading to masturbation, rape, homosexuality, prostitution and venereal diseases and, particularly, to very early sexual intercourse and premature maternity. Mayo's claims were supported by British Indian authorities as a countermeasure to growing sympathies for the Indian Independence Movement against British rule in the region. The book was thus received enthusiastically by British authorities and propagated among Americans who related the movement for Indian independence with the American Revolution. The book prompted the publication of over fifty critical books and pamphlets and an eponymous film. It was burned in India and New York, along with an effigy of its author.Frick, Katherine (Spring 2006) Mayo, Katherine (Prence, Katherine) . libraries.psu.edu It was criticized by Mahatma Gandhi, who wrote in response: After its publication Dalip Singh Saund (later a congressman) wrote My Mother India to counter Mayo's assertions. Another response to Mayo's book was Dhan Gopal Mukerji's A Son of Mother India Answers. Reprint 1928 by Rupa & Company, The title of the 1957 Hindi epic film Mother India was a deliberate rebuke to Mayo's book. Lala Lajpat Rai wrote a book in response to this book called Unhappy India in 1928. This book by Rai answers to the observations by Mayo and is considered worthy of read to understand the topic completely.https://www.hindustanbooks.com/books/unhappy_india/Unhappy_India.html Works * Justice to All: History of the Pennsylvania State Police (1917) * The Standard Bearers: True Stories of Heroes of Law and Order (1918) * That Damn Y (1920) * Mounted Justice: True Stories of the Pennsylvania State Police (1922) * The Isles of Fear: The Truth about the Philippines (1925) * Mother India (1927) * Slaves of the Gods (1929) * Volume II (1931) * Soldiers What Next!

This landmark was placed in Adamsville because of convenience - land had been donated on this corner, for the purpose of erecting the monument. The Rhode Island Red was actually originally bred closer to West Main Road, outside of the Village of Adamsville. Across from the monument is the popular breakfast restaurant called The Barn, which opened in 1987. Another distinctive feature of the town is the \\"Spite Tower\\" found in the village. Local lore claims that the tower was constructed to obscure the line of sight of a town local. While most stories involve members of the local Manchester family, there is no consensus as to the true history of the structure. According to the present day owner of the building, the \\"Spite Tower\\" was built above an artesian well. There was a pump that brought the water to a holding tank on the third floor that sent water, via gravity feed, to main house's water tank to provide running water. The building was constructed circa 1905. The chauffeur's residence was on the second floor of the tower.

History In 1802, the first wooden dam and a gristmill were built on the river at the site of the village, which was then known as Nichols Bridge.Historic and Architectural Resources of Richmond, Rhode Island: A Preliminary Report, Rhode Island Historical Preservation Commission, 1977Historic and Architectural Resources of Charlestown, Rhode Island: A Preliminary Report, Rhode Island Historical Preservation Commission, 1981 A few years later, a cotton mill was established, with production buildings mostly located in Richmond and some employee housing located across the river in Charlestown. Rowland G. Hazard bought the mill in 1843 and renamed it the Carolina Mills Company in honor of his wife Caroline Newbold Hazard of South Kingstown. The village around the mill was also given the same name. The Rhode Island Historic Preservation Commission described 19th-century Carolina as a \\"center for the surrounding area, including a school, a church, a post office, a bank, several stores, a blacksmith shop, and halls for meetings, lectures, and 'entertainments'.\\" The local post office was named \\"Carolina Mills\\" from 1850 until 1879, when it was renamed \\"Carolina.\\"Rhode Island Historical Society Postal History Collection website, accessed July 9, 2009 In 1862, the complex switched from cotton textile production to production of woolens.

The portion of Carolina village which is located in the town of Richmond includes a corridor of about two dozen 1-story and 1½-story cottages and other domestic buildings built between about 1840 and 1870. Other buildings of historic interest include the remains of the mill; the Carolina School, built in 1845; the Carolina Free Will Baptist Church, built in 1845 and relocated in 1865; the octagonal Albert Potter House, built in 1867; and a 2½-story Queen Anne style house built by Ellison Tinkham, who was one of the owners of the mills from 1868 until 1907. Carolina was also the site of one of the first trout farms in America. John W. Hoxie established the Clearwater Trout Farm in 1877 on White Brook on land leased from Rowland G. Hazard, north of the village center. Two years later, Hoxie's brother Charles established his own White Brook Trout Hatchery on an adjacent plot of land along the brook. By 1892, the White Brook Trout Hatchery was incorporated as the American Fish Culture Company with Rowland Hazard II as a minority shareholder. The Hazard family gained controlling interest in the corporation in 1899. Upon the death of John W. Hoxie in 1903, the R.

It is designed to be used in a dual language system with the Java programming language. The goals of the Pnuts project are to provide a small, fast scripting language that has tight integration with the Java language. Pnuts uses syntax that is simple and friendly to Java developers, while also being very expressive.  Relationship to Java  Because Java and Pnuts share the same type system, Java code can easily invoke or define Pnuts functions. Likewise, Pnuts code can easily manipulate Java objects. Pnuts code can even define Java classes. Because Pnuts compiles to Java byte codes, these classes can be used by Java just like any other class. A class written in Pnuts can even later be replaced by a class written in Java with no other code changes. Pnuts syntax can look very similar to Java. The following is a code sample written in Java that is also a valid Pnuts script: import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; List countries = new ArrayList(); countries.add(\\"Canada\\"); countries.add(\\"Austria\\"); countries.add(\\"Brazil\\"); Collections.sort(countries); for (String country : countries) System.out.println(\\"Hello \\" + country); Alternatively, the expressiveness of Pnuts could be utilized: use(\\"pnuts.lib\\") // Standard module that makes sort, println and other functions available. countries = [\\"Canada\\", \\"Austria\\", \\"Brazil\\"] sort(countries) for (country : countries) println(\\"Hello \\" + country)  History  Pnuts was originally developed in 1997 by Toyokazu Tomatsu as a testing tool for Java classes. Pnuts has since been extended, mainly focusing on essential functionality required for a Java-based scripting engine, such as a module system and bytecode compiler.

He is the legal guardian of younger brother Jimmy (Andre Kinney) after the death of their parents. He is receiving constant letters about impending foreclosure on his home and the state is considering the placement of Jimmy in a foster home, due to his truancy and Ty's inability to adequately care for him. Ty is approached by Mike Cochrane (Matt Dillon), his godfather and co- worker, and informed of Mike's plan to steal money being transferred from the Federal Reserve System to the local banks. Ty turns down the offer to participate in the crime. The following morning, after receiving assurances from Mike that no one will be hurt, Ty reluctantly agrees to participate. The six-person crew offloads the first truck at an abandoned steel mill, but their plan is compromised when a homeless man living in the mill is spotted observing them. Baines (Laurence Fishburne) shoots the potential witness. Upset over this, Ty barricades himself inside the truck with the remaining $21 million inside. After an attempt to flee in the truck fails, Ty sets off the truck's alarm. The alarm catches the attention of Jake Eckehart (Milo Ventimiglia), a local sheriff's deputy. The remaining thieves plan to break into the truck by knocking the pins out of the door hinges. Jake arrives when Ty successfully restores power to the truck's alarm. Baines shoots Jake. While the thieves are distracted, Ty sneaks Jake into the truck. Dobbs (Skeet Ulrich) begins to have second thoughts about the operation and agrees with Ty to get the fuse Mike removed from the engine. Dobbs is caught trying to put it back and Palmer stabs him to death. As the thieves continue to remove the door hinges, Ty covers the interior windows with the remainder of the $21 million and takes Jake's radio to the roof in an attempt to contact the authorities. He is caught by Palmer, but Ty is able to convince Palmer that what they are doing is not right. Palmer consequently commits suicide. The remaining thieves reveal their possession of a kidnapped Jimmy. Ty complies with their demands, before Quinn (Jean Reno) and Baines head for the money. The two men are killed by a booby trap rigged in the money case. Mike chases after Ty in the working armored truck and crashes into a pit, the accident being fatal for him. Later, as Jake is recovering in the hospital, Ashcroft tells Ty that Jake spoke of his efforts to stop the thieves. There is talk of giving Ty a reward.

A. O. Scott, in a New York Times review, wrote that the Hungarian director, Nimród Antal, \\"has an old-fashioned, functional style. […] He has made an unabashed B movie: basic, brutal and sometimes clumsy, but far from dumb, and not bad at all\\". The film doesn't minimize the seriousness of killing and conveys a bleak outlook on economic blight \\"with quiet passion and conviction\\", Scott wrote. The cinematography of Andrzej Sekuła (whose work also appears in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction) helps capture that mood, according to Scott.

Feathered cloaks and headdresses include the ʻahuʻula capes and mahiole helmets were worn by Hawaiian royalty; many are now on display at the Bishop Museum, and other museums across the world. Kāhili are a type of feathered standard, another symbol of royalty. The introduction of foreign species, overhunting, and environment changes drove birds with desirable feathers, such as the ‘ō‘ō and mamo, to extinction, although the ʻiʻiwi managed to survive despite its popularity. Mexican feather work was a Pre-Columbian art form which was continued after the Conquest of Mexico, originally organized by the Spanish missionaries into a luxury export trade, sending objects back to Europe. Immediately after the conquest existing objects such as Montezuma's headdress, now in Vienna, were admired in the courts of Europe. Although featherwork is primarily used for clothing, headdresses, ceremonial shields, and tapestries, the Pomo peoples of California are famous for the minute featherwork of their grass baskets, many of which are on display at the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington. The Maori of New Zealand used featherwork to construct cloaks for clothing and to decorate kete (bags) and weapons.

Background and murder Newspaper accounts described Watson as \\"a negro navy cook\\" who was \\"short, stocky, and powerfully built,\\" with an \\"above average\\" education. He was a native of Norfolk, Virginia. His victim, Benjamin Leroy Hobbs, was from Nebo, North Carolina and lived with his poor widowed mother. He was five days away from being honorably discharged, after which he planned to move in with his mother to help her with the family farm. In the early morning hours of July 25, 1946, in Key West, Florida, David Watson murdered Hobbs, a 19-year- old seaman. The two were aboard the U.S.S. Stribling, a naval ship, at the time of the murder; Hobbs' body was found in the ship's gun turret the next day. Two days after the murder, authorities placed Watson in naval custody as he was the prime suspect in the murder. For two weeks, authorities carried out a \\"highly secret\\" manhunt to confirm the identity of the killer, monitoring Watson's shipmates as well to detect their movements and eliminate other suspects. Finally, after two weeks of searching and twelve days of keeping Watson in custody, the FBI and the office of naval intelligence extracted an oral confession from Watson. Watson confessed to committing the murder alone. His motive was sexual assault - he had attempted to sexually attack Hobbs in his bunk, but when Hobbs fought back, Watson decided to kill him to avoid detection and consequences for the sexual attack. After the attempted sexual assault, Watson bludgeoned and strangled Hobbs to death. When Watson was first arrested, he was held in a naval shipyard in Miami. Later, after authorities transported Watson to the county jail in Miami to await his trial for murder, they discovered an iron bar and two hidden razors on his person. Trials Watson had two trials. During the first, which took place in October 1946, Watson's mother Inez, a schoolteacher born in Pennsylvania, was reported to have attended many of the proceedings. On October 4, 1946, Watson was convicted of first-degree murder, and the jury refused to recommend mercy, resulting in Watson receiving a death sentence. However, this first sentence was reversed on appeal sometime in 1947, and Watson earned a second trial. During Watson's second trial, his defense attempted to paint Watson as someone afflicted with a \\"psychopathic personality.\\" Attorney A.C. Dressler stated during the defense's closing statements, \\"[Watson] has a warped mind; he is a lost soul. If you comply with the oath you took, you cannot kill. You cannot send this boy to the chair.\\" Watson's other defense attorney, John G. Sawyer, argued that Watson should be put away in prison for life \\"for the good of society. His life should not be taken.\\" On the contrary, the United States District Attorney working for the prosecution, Herbert S. Phillips, argued that Watson was a \\"cunning murderer.\\" The prosecution, basing their arguments on Watson's confession, purported that Watson's motive for murdering Hobbs was to avoid detection and a court martial after Watson had attempted to commit a \\"pervert act\\" on Hobbs. Contrasting the defense's argument that Watson's psychopathy made him less responsible for his actions, Phillips read Watson's confession to the jury and stated that the confession showed that Watson was fully aware of his actions. The judge, John W. Holland, instructed the jury that if they agreed with the defense that Watson was not criminally responsible for his actions because of his purported psychopathy impairing his judgment, then the jury could not find him guilty of a crime higher than second-degree murder. As first-degree murder was the only murder charge punishable by death by the federal government at the time, the jury finding Watson guilty of second-degree murder or less would have saved his life. However, the second trial concluded on August 7, 1947, and Watson was again convicted of first-degree murder; the jury again refused to recommend mercy, and Watson was again sentenced to death. Judge Holland formally passed the second sentence two weeks after the jury reached their verdict. Appeals and execution Watson appealed his second death sentence to the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of Florida. The first death sentence had been reversed due to an error involving the judge not instructing the jury on the possibility of Watson being found guilty of a lesser charge due to mental impairment. However, on April 1, 1948, the second death sentence was affirmed, with the District Court finding that Watson's murder was \\"shocking\\" and committed with \\"vile motive,\\" and that \\"the trial court went to great lengths to see to it that the defendant had a fair and lawful trial.\\" The second appeal affirming his death sentence also pointed out that two separate juries had found Watson guilty of the same crime on the same \\"overwhelming evidence\\" and that the second trial was \\"free from reversible error,\\" thereby paving the way for Watson to be executed. In one final attempt to save his life, Watson appealed to President Harry S. Truman for clemency, but Truman refused to intervene in the sentence, making his intentions known a week prior to the scheduled execution date. According to the Associated Press, Watson spent his final hours praying with a minister and singing hymns. He also received a final visit from his mother. On the morning of Wednesday, September 15, 1948, Watson was executed in the electric chair at the Union Correctional Institution in Raiford, Florida, where Florida kept their electric chair until 1961. He was placed in the chair at 9:11 A.M. and pronounced dead a few minutes later. Watson was 23 years old at the time of his execution. Watson was the third federal inmate executed under President Truman and one of only two inmates executed on a federal execution warrant in Florida during the 20th century. Unlike the first, James Alderman, Watson was put to death in Florida's electric chair in the Union Correctional Institution. Contrarily, Alderman was hanged at the U.S. Coast Guard Station near Fort Lauderdale, Florida. At the time of Alderman's execution, it was customary for all federal inmates to be executed by hanging regardless of the method used by the state where they committed their capital crime. However, the law changed in 1936 following the botched hanging of Earl Gardner, a federal inmate in Arizona, where state law provided for executions by gas chamber. From 1936 onward, federal inmates were executed by the method used by the state where they committed their capital crime. During both Alderman's execution in 1929 and Watson's execution in 1948, the electric chair was Florida's method of execution, as the state had adopted the electric chair in 1923 and, save for Alderman's federal execution, exclusively used the electric chair instead of hanging starting in October 1924. Presently, all federal executions take place in Terre Haute, Indiana; all federal executions are carried out by lethal injection, regardless of the methods permitted for use in the state where an executed federal death row inmate committed their capital crime.

Holden Roberto was the president of GRAE. GRAE was founded in April 1962. GRAE had its armed forces stationed in Congo-Kinshasa and conducted military training there.Whitaker, Paul M.. The Revolutions of 'Portuguese' Africa, in The Journal of Modern African Studies, Vol. 8, No. 1. (Apr., 1970), pp. 15-35. However, as Moïse Tshombe became Prime Minister in Congo-Kinshasa, Congolese aid for GRAE was reduced. In July 1964, the Foreign Minister of GRAE, Jonas Savimbi, resigned (in 1966 he would form a movement of his own, UNITA). Initially, GRAE forces fought mainly in the northern Dembo forests. However, in early 1969 GRAE opened a second front along the Zambian border. OAU recognition When the Organization for African Unity was founded in 1963, GRAE was granted exclusive recognition as the legitimate government of Angola, a move which spurred the Congolese government to expel the MPLA forces (a rival liberation movement to FNLA) from Congo-Kinshasa. However, in 1964 OAU also recognized MPLA as a legitimate liberation movement, and gradually support was reduced for GRAE. In the period 1971-1972 GRAE received 61666 pounds sterling from the OAU, 5.69% of the total amounts donated by the OAU to different African liberation movements at the time. During the same period, OAU gave MPLA 180334 pounds sterling.Gonidec, Pierre François. African Politics. The Hague: Matinus Nijhoff, 1981. p. 272 International linkages GRAE constituted a bloc of African movements, together with the Pan-Africanist Congress (South Africa), Revolutionary Committee of Mozambique and Zimbabwe African National Union. Through this cooperation, GRAE gave some military assistance to its Mozambican counterpart. In the 1960s, GRAE received a large share of humanitarian aid for Angolan refugees from Western sources. GRAE was supported by China. GRAE did also receive some assistance from the Soviet bloc.

The organization applies a collaborative business model to the process of medical research with the aim of accelerating the identification and development of new patient treatments. MRF's goal is to license its first drug target for commercial drug development by July 1, 2009, five years after the organization began funding research. Myelin Repair Foundation, \\"Vision and Mission.\\" The MRF was created by entrepreneur Scott Johnson in 2002, and began funding research in 2004. On June 22, 2015, the Foundation announced that due to a lack of financing, it will begin the process of winding down. Background The Myelin Repair Foundation was founded in 2002 by Scott Johnson, a California entrepreneur. Johnson had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at the age of 20. When given his prognosis, he was told that an effective therapy would probably not be on the market for another 30 to 50 years. “If someone is diagnosed now…they’d probably hear the same thing,” Johnson says. “And that’s pretty frustrating.” Myelin Repair Foundation, “A New Model Offering New Hope.” The ARC Model The MRF conducts research according to the Accelerated Research Collaboration (ARC) model, which also guides the organization's goals and objectives. Under the ARC model, MRF-funded researchers in different labs design and carry out experiments together and share results in real time, thus accelerating the rate at which medical discoveries are made. The results, called “potential drug or therapeutic targets,” are then validated, patented and licensed to a pharmaceutical partner who will take them through the clinical trials process and into a new treatment. The MRF actively manages the drug discovery process from its origins in basic research through to the clinical trials process where new treatments are produced.Myelin Repair Foundation, “Accelerated Research Collaboration (ARC).” Advisory Boards MRF receives scientific and industry guidance from a Board of Directors, a Scientific Advisory Board, a Business Advisory Committee, and a Drug Discovery Advisory Group.Myelin Repair Foundation, “Myelin Repair Foundation Launches First-of-a-Kind Drug Discovery Advisory Group.” Members of these advisory and governing boards include Andy Cates of the Value Acquisition Fund; Dr. Stephen Hauser of the University of California at San Francisco; Dr. Christopher Lipinski; and Dr. Mark Scheidler of the National Institutes of Health–National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.Myelin Repair Foundation, “Board and Advisors.” Funding The MRF is funded by individuals, foundations, and corporations: including the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; the Donaghue Foundation; the Thomas H.

During his career, he made over 350 appearances in The Football League most notably with Cardiff City where he spent eight years, helping the side to seven Welsh Cup victories. He later played for Hereford United, Newport County and Gloucester City. Career =Early career= Born in Stourbridge, Bell supported West Bromwich Albion as a child and spent time on trial with the club at the age of 15, having previously played reserve team football for Halesowen Town as a left winger in the Worcestershire Combination League. West Brom manager Jimmy Hagan offered Bell an amateur deal at The Hawthorns but he never played a senior match for the club. Bell took a job working at Halesowen steelworks during his time with the Baggies. Bell was offered a contract by non-league side Lower Gornal Athletic when their manager, Fred Whittle, visited Bell's home. Despite his father recommending that he stay with West Bromwich as an amateur, Bell accepted the contract, earning six pound a week plus a two-pound win bonus. =Cardiff City= Whilst playing for Lower Gornal, Bell was spotted by Cardiff City and signed professional terms with the club, along with George Andrews for a combined transfer fee of £2,100, a record amount that still stands for Gornal Athletic. He made his debut in September 1966 as a left half against Wolverhampton Wanderers. His debut was far from impressive as he gave away two penalties during a 7–1 defeat by the Midlands side. He struggled to make an impact on the side until he was converted to a left-back by manager Jimmy Scoular and he established a strong full back pairing with David Carver. He was a virtual ever present from then on and was part of the Cardiff side that defeated Real Madrid 1–0 at Ninian Park in the 1970–71 European Cup Winners' Cup. During the game, Bell was tasked with marking Spanish international winger Amancio Amaro and swapped shirts with Pirri after the match. He was eventually displaced from the side by Freddie Pethard. He was loaned out to Hereford United during his last season at Cardiff and was allowed to join Newport County following his return who were managed by his former teammate Brian Harris. =Later career= He was a vital part of Newport's team during his spell at the club before he moved to Gloucester City in 1978. He spent nearly two years with the Tigers, being appointed club captain for the 1978–79 season. Bell later moved into Welsh league football with Bridgend Town. Following his retirement, Bell worked as a mental health rehabilitation worker and later worked alongside other former Cardiff players, such as Roger Gibbins and Brian Clark, in the club's hospitality lounges on matchdays. 52 years after signing for Cardiff, he is still employed by the club in this role.

The location is situated at the intersection of Central Chapel Road, Grove School Road, and Seventy-Six Road (most of which is Tompkins County Route 115). Although the United States Census does not have a listing for the population of Guide Board Corners, the town of which it is located, town of Caroline, has a population of 2,910 (2000 Census). The education for the residents of the location go to either the schools in nearby Brooktondale, or into districts of other nearby cities/villages.  History  The area around Caroline was first part of nearby Tioga County, New York, until 1817, when Tompkins County was created and took over the area, which included Guide Board Corners. The location got its name from early settlers in the town of Caroline due to the guide signs once located at the intersections of Seventy- six Road and Central Chapel Road.  Education  As with most of the town of Caroline, Guide Board Corner's students are sent to schools either in Caroline itself, or in other districts. These other districts include Dryden, Candor, Ithaca, and Newark Valley.  Transportation  United States Geological Survey 1976 map of Guide Board Corners Guide Board Corners is accessible by several different roads leading from other parts of the town. The most major of these is Central Chapel Road (part of County Route 115), which runs from north to south through the center of Guide Board Corners. This road provides access to Brooktondale and Slaterville, which are near New York State Route 79. Central Chapel Road, where it comes to the large intersection, was once part of New York State Route 330, which ran from Guide Board Corners to Besemer (at NY 79). Heading southward out of Guide Board Corners along Central Chapel Road brings you to Brearley Hill. The road leading west out of Guide Board Corners is Grove School Road, which heads westward, ending at an intersection with Bald Hill Road. Although the road goes only for a short distance, it has a history dating back to 1972, when the remains of Hurricane Agnes struck the area. The road was closed due to major flooding and damaged bridges. However, according to Tompkins County officials, the roads were \\"generally awful all over\\". Middaugh Road and NY 79 were also closed off due to Agnes. The last major road in Guide Board Corners is the Seventy-six Road. This highway, part of County Route 115, heads from Speedsville and the Tioga County line all the way to Guide Board Corners. This section was built in 1804-1808 as \\"76 Road\\", often corrupted in popular speech to \\"Old 76 Road\\".

Based in Washington, D.C., since 2008, the Kastles won the WTT championship in the 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 seasons. The team is named for Kastle Systems, the office security company owned by team owner Mark Ein. Venue The Kastles play outdoors on the roof of Union Market at 1309 5th Street, NE, Washington, DC. The team played its 2008, 2009, and 2010 seasons in a temporary stadium erected each summer on the site of the former Washington Convention Center in downtown Washington. They played the next three seasons at Kastles Stadium at The Wharf, a 2,600-seat facility erected in 2011 on the Southwest Waterfront. That facility was torn down for the city's waterfront development project. From 2014 to 2018, the Kastles played indoors at George Washington University's Charles E. Smith Center at 22nd and G Streets NW. In 2014, two matches drew 3,275 fans, setting a Kastles attendance record. A new record of 4,200-plus was set the following year after the venue sold out and additional seating section was installed. History The Kastles began World TeamTennis play as an expansion franchise in 2008 and finished 6–8 in their inaugural season. They won their first King Trophy (named after former world No. 1 player and league co-owner Billie Jean King) in 2009 despite losing their first four matches and finishing just 7–7 during the regular season. The Kastles failed to qualify for the playoffs in 2010 but then went undefeated in both the 2011 and 2012 seasons, winning all 14 regular-season matches, the Eastern Conference championship and the WTT championship. In 2011, the Kastles went undefeated, the first perfect season for a World TeamTennis team and only the second team, after the 1994 Newport Beach Dukes, to win all of its regular-season matches. (The Newport Beach Dukes lost in the playoffs). It was the first time a Washington professional sports team posted an undefeated regular season and also won its league championship. In 2012, the Kastles finished 16–0 again, becoming the first U.S. professional sports team to complete back-to-back perfect seasons. The Kastles won their 2013 season opener against the New York Sportimes, 23–15, notching their 33rd consecutive victory and equaling the winning streak of the NBA's 1971–72 Los Angeles Lakers. In their next match, they beat the Boston Lobsters, 25–12, a 34th victory that set the U.S. record for a winning streak by a major professional sports team.http://wtop.com/news/2013/07/washington- kastles-hold-longest-winning-streak-in-american-sports/slide/1/ On July 10, 2013, the Kastles had their winning streak snapped by the Texas Wild in Las Colinas, Texas. The next night at home, the Kastles fell to the Springfield Lasers. Martina Hingis was not with the team for the back-to-back losses due to her induction into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. The Kastles won the remaining 10 matches of the regular season and ended up with the best record in the WTT at 12–2. The Kastles beat the Boston Lobsters in the Eastern Conference Championship match on July 25 by a score of 25–12. The Kastles repeated that score of 25–12 in a rain-delayed WTT Championship match against the Springfield Lasers to win their third consecutive WTT Championship and post a final season record of 14–2. The Kastles continued their winning ways in 2014. Even though the Kastles lost four regular season matches (a home record of 6–1), they posted the best record in the Eastern Conference and hosted the Philadelphia Freedoms in the Eastern Conference Championship match. The Kastles won their 5th Eastern Conference Championship by a score of 21–16. The Kastles then traveled to Springfield, Missouri, to face the Springfield Lasers in the Mylan WTT Championship Match on July 27, 2014. Since the Kastles had a better regular-season record, they were considered the home team. The Kastles swept all five events and won their fourth consecutive WTT Championship by a score of 25–13. Bobby Reynolds won his Men's Singles event and the Men's Doubles event, his last match as a Washington Kastle. The only other team in the 39-year history of World Team Tennis that won four championships in a row are the Sacramento Capitals. With their WTT Championship in 2015, the Kastles stand alone with five consecutive WTT titles. The Kastles have missed the playoffs and failed to win the Eastern Conference Championship and WTT Championship only five times in the existence of the franchise (2008, 2010, 2016, 2017 and 2018). In 2015, the Kastles got off to a slow start and after the first seven matches of the season the team's record was 4–3. In typical Kastles style, the team then reeled off 5 wins in a row and won 6 out of the 7 final matches of the regular season to end up with a record of 10–4, the best record in the WTT's Eastern Conference. On July 30, 2015, the Kastles hosted the Philadelphia Freedoms at home in the Eastern Conference Championship by a score of 25–9. On Sunday, August 2, 2015 the Kastles hosted the Austin Aces in the WTT Finals and defeated the Aces 24–18 in extended play. The Kastles extended their consecutive WTT Championship Title streak to 5 in a row and their 6th overall title. The 2016 Rio Summer Olympics took place during the 2016 World TeamTennis season and many teams had multiple players attend the event. The Kastles were no exception with Leander Paes, Anastasia Rodionova, Martina Hingis and Venus Williams attending the Olympics. The Kastles missed the playoffs for the first time since 2010 and finished third in the league with a record of 7-5 (only 12 matches were played in 2016). On February 16, 2017 the Mylan WTT Marque Draft was held. The Kastles drafted Martina Hingis, Venus Williams and Bob and Mike Bryan (all were protected status by the Kastles). On March 13, 2017 it was announced that Mark Ein and Fred Luddy (owner of the San Diego Aviators) had purchased Billie Jean King's majority ownership of the WTT. King will retain a minority stake in WTT and continue as majority owner of the Philadelphia Freedoms franchise. Mark Ein will become Chairman of World Team Tennis and Ilana Kloss will remain as CEO and Commissioner through 2017. Mr. Ein has also recently invested in a new DC-based team in the Overwatch League, a professional eSports league developed and fully controlled by Blizzard Entertainment. On March 14, 2017 the WTT Roster Draft was held. Washington selected Sam Querrey, Bruno Soares, Madison Brengle and Anastasia Rodionova. On March 13, 2018 the WTT Draft was held. Washington protected Bob and Mike Bryan, Venus Williams and Madison Brengle. The Kastles selected Tennys Sandgren (first round), Robert Lindstedt (second round) and Nicole Melichar (third round). Also returning to the Kastles is Frances Tiafoe who was added to the roster after the drafts and Naomi Osaka was also added. Matthew Ebden and Christina McHale appeared as substitutes in the first match of the season. The 2019 WTT Draft was held In March 2019 at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. The Kastles drafted Frances Tiafoe, Nick Kyrgios, Venus Williams, Bruno Soares, Ooshihito Mishioka, Marta Kostyuk and Lyudmyla Kichenok. Tiafoe, Williams and Kyrgios were declared franchise players. =Justin Gimelstob controversy= On June 25, 2008, Kastles' player Justin Gimelstob was on the Washington, D.C., morning radio show \\"The Sports Junkies\\", talking about his tennis career, his interactions with other tennis pros, his dalliances with such female players as Martina Hingis, and a variety of other topics. During the interview, Gimelstob, a regular guest on the show, said that when he faced Anna Kournikova (who played for the St. Louis Aces) the following month match in Washington: \\"I’m going to serve it right at the body, about 128, right into her midriff. If she's not crying by the time she comes off court then I did not do my job.\\" Asked if that meant he hated the Russian, with whom he trained as a youth, he replied: \\"Hate is a very strong word. I just despise her to the maximum level just below hate.\\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/atptour/2304243/Tennis- official-Justin-Gimelstob-serves-up-sexist-rant-against-top-female- players.html Telegraph retrieved 6th June 2016 He added that he would not like to sleep with Kournikova, \\"because she's such a douche.\\" Instead, \\"I wouldn't mind having my younger brother, who's a kind of a stud, nail her and then reap the benefits of that.\\" Gimelstob subsequently lost his job as a commentator on the Tennis Channel. Kournikova originally had planned to pull herself from the event but decided to play. In the mixed doubles portion of the match, Mashona Washington and Gimelstob defeated Kournikova and Travis Rettenmaier. 5–2 (though Gimelstob did not start the set. He came in for Scott Oudsema at 2–0). People =Head coach= Thomas Blake was named head coach of the Washington Kastles in June 2008. Blake became a professional tennis player in 1996 and most notably partnered with his brother, James Blake, to play doubles in the US Open in 1996 and 2002. In 2005, Blake retired from professional singles play. Murphy Jensen was named the Kastles' head coach at the start of the 2009 season. Jensen and his brother, Luke, won the French Open doubles championship in 1993 and hosts a show on the Tennis Channel.

","title":"Washington Kastles"},{"id":"16718966","text":"The concept of a \\"pan-Caribbean\\" culture area refers to recent proposals by an international group of archaeologists to the effect that contacts among Pre- Columbian peoples of the Yucatán Peninsula, the Antilles, Central America, and northern South America may have been more extensive than heretofore acknowledged. A pan-Caribbean perspective seeks to emphasize the importance of considering information from the a broad area, one characterized as \\"the American Mediterranean,\\" in evaluating issues of mobility, exchange, linguistics, ideology, art, material culture, and identity. The pan-Caribbean area was one whose peoples interacted regularly with those of Mesoamerica, the Isthmo-Colombian area, and the Amazon basin, creating a context that had significant effects on culture change throughout a large portion of the Americas. The culture of the Caribbean people as practiced and experienced among the islands of the Caribbean sea, that stretch from the Bahamas in the north to the mainland shores of the Guianas in the south. Caribbean anthropologist, like their colleagues in sociology, history, geography, political science, are increasingly expanding the frontiers of their respective disciplines to overlap and encompass previous academic boundaries in their quest to effectively represent and interpret the heterogeneity of the Caribbean experience. In terms of the social context of Caribbean people, an increasingly important issue archeologists are addressing relates to the identification of culture diversity. In recent years, a growing body of indigenous voices in Caribbean archeology is expressing disdain for and resistance to the hegemony of colonialist interpretations of Caribbean pre- Columbian history. As such, new historical frameworks and visions of past dynamics have become centers of active scholarship in Caribbean archeology.Keegan, William F., Corinne Lisette Hofman, and Reniel Rodríguez Ramos.

Environment The relief of El kseur is characterized by its mountainous aspect. Indeed, the town is located in a narrow valley between the Ibarissen massif (the last rocky massif of Djurdjura in the east before the Gouraya massif) and the first comforts of the Babors in the South East as well as a bed Of wadi important that separates the city center to the city Berchiche one of the oldest cities of the city. =Hydrography= The hydrographic network contains a large drainage basin, namely the Oued-Soummam basin. The town of El kseur is supplied with water by the dam of Tichy-haf located in the locality of Bouhamza. The dam is fed by the rain and melt water of the Djurdjura's nival coat. It has a storage capacity of 150 million m3 and supplies the wilaya of Béjaïa with 20,000 m3 / day. =Climate= The town of El Kseur enjoys a temperate and humid climate with a mild winter characteristic of the Mediterranean zones and an important rainfall, like all the towns of the eastern half of the Algerian coast. Due to the mountainous massifs surrounding the city, it snow every year in winter between December and February for high altitudes of over 600 m. Name The indigenous people called the town of El Kseur Iɣil Mɛebed (in Berber). On the other hand, the name of El Kurs comes from the Arabic qasar, in Algerian Arabic qsar, plural qsur, meaning \\"palace\\" or \\"fortified village\\", berberized in Leqser; The municipality takes its name from a courthouse which gave its celebrity to the city. Another hypothesis, more probable, gives origin of the name the citadel (qasr) erected in 1327 during the siege of Bgayet by the Zianides. Ibn Khaldun speaks of it in his book \\"History of the Berbers\\".Foudil Cheriguen, Toponymie algérienne des lieux habités (les noms composés), Alger, Épigraphe, 1993, p. 98.  History  Roman ruins of Tubusuptu, Tiklat, El Kseur.In Roman times, El Kseur was known as Tubusuctu (or even \\"Tubusuptu\\"). It was a Roman colony founded by Augustus for military veterans. Economically, the colony was known for its olive oil. Today, Roman ruins include baths, which are well preserved. =French Rule= During the colonization, El Kseur was in 1872 a center of European settlement. Many Alsatians and Lorrainers settled there, especially after the French defeat of 1870 against Prussia. Nearly 470 settlers settled in El Kseur, which took the name of Bitche. This name will not stay long since El Kseur or Ighil Maabed will take over. Today still the colonial district is present, it is on the national road, near the town hall in particular. During the war in Algeria, El Kseur was one of the first regions in Kabylie to join the FLN in 1954, a group of wanted militants of the FLN of the region joined the maquis; Salah Hocine, Tahar Amirouchen, Khatri Madjid, Arezki Oukmamou and his brother Hocine, Mokrane Harani, Kamel Chikhi, Larbi Touati and so many others have to quote their why say so much else they are cleaner. They will all become valuable officers in the ALN.http://www.lexpressiondz.com/actualite/204065-madjid-khatri-le- baroudeur.html [archive] El Kseur was the scene of several battles between the colonial army and the guerrillas of wilaya III. Faced with a threat France set up prohibited zones in order to cut the resistance of the population and thus deprive them of popular support. Thus, in 1955, in the Aures first, then in Kabylia, and then in the rest of Algeria, population regrouping camps were built. In El Koire, at first, the mountaineers who had been driven out of their villages, often in violence,Le témoignage d'un rescapé nous dit que son père fut abattu à bout portant par l'armée française. Il refusait de quitter sa maison, dans le hameau de Bouhamed, et fut tué pour l'exemple. had to settle near the river in makeshift camps made by their care. It was in 1959 and in 1960, in the context of the realization of the Plan of Constantine, that houses were erected. They were mostly made at Berchiche, that is, far from European settlers. These regroupment campsUn mémoire de GHANEM Zoubir traite de ce sujet, Les déplacés de la guerre d'Algérie dans la vallée de la Soummam de 1955 à 1961, Paris, 2009 were for some appalling, Michel Rocard presented them in 1958 as concentration camps of slow death. In Ighzer Amokrane, in the Soummam valley, nearly 1,000 people were piled up in deplorable sanitary conditions, infant mortality was very high and hunger deaths were counted by hundreds each month. =Scouts= Born on June 14, 1928 in Ait Oussalah, a native of Ait Oussalah Arch abrares douar I3MRANEN, Salhi Hocine made his early footsteps in revolutionary militancy in Khemis-Miliana, with his classmate Si M'Hamed Bougara (another future chahid) .

Chambers. . may have been in the vicinity at a much earlier date. Alexander Cunninghame, the Commendator of Kilwinning Abbey, was shot at his gate at Montgreenan by Sir Robert Montgomerie of Skelmorlie (better known for building the Skelmorlie Aisle as his burial place) on 1 August 1586, as a direct result of the assassination of the Fourth Earl of Eglinton at Stewarton in April of that year. John SmithSmith, John (1895). Prehistoric Man in Ayrshire. London : Elliot Stock. in 1895 recorded that in the Montgreenan Woods are the remains of a Bishop's Palace, sometimes called a castle, of which little appears to be known. Not far away is part of an ancient gateway, and just South of the house there are the remains of a mound which once contained an ice-house. All that remains at this site is a small piece of wall at the side of the stream, and a slight hollow, partly surrounded by a bank formed by the rubbish of the old walls. Mr R. Glasgow, the proprietor, stated in the 1856 Name Book of the Ordnance Survey that the dwelling probably became disused in 1680, when the last Cunninghame of Montgreenan was forfeited. Much of its remains were removed about 1765 by the previous proprietor, Mr Stevenson, to build a house at Kilwinning. A visit in 1956 recorded that in the thick vegetation were traces of buildings, enclosed by a wall on the West and South sides. The details were unclear, but the castle plan seemed to be that of a courtyard with internal buildings on all sides except perhaps the East, where there is a wall running along the edge of the Lugton Water. Such a building design with a central courtyard was called a 'Place' or 'Palace' due to its construction, not its size.McKean, Charles (2001). The Scottish Chateau. Sutton Publishing. . P. 53. All the walls were merely heaps of rubble, and the drystone \\"courtyard\\" wall seemed to be of later construction than the internal remains, acting as a revetment to the mass of rubble inside. This wall was 1.4m high. No clear evidence was encountered for this being a \\"Bishop's Palace\\". About 65.0m to the South was a mound, 1.5m high, which had been cut through by a track, and may be the ice-house referred to by Smith, although no stone-work exists. No trace of a gateway was found, although the possible entrance shown on OS plan may be the gateway referred to. =Views of Montgreenan Castle or Bishop's Palace in 2007= Image:Cowlinnburn.JPGThe Cowlinn Burn from Clonbeith joining the Lugton Water at Montgreenan Castle.

The present Georgian mansion with architectural features by Alexander 'Greek' ThompsonAlexander (Grek) Thompson was built by Sir Robert Glasgow in 1817. Sir Robert, in common with other entrepreneurs from the Glasgow area, made his fortune through a shipping company based in St Vincent in the West Indies, undoubtedly trading between Britain, Africa and the sugar plantations of the West Indies. Montgreenan was the home of the Viscounts Weir until 1982, when it was sold and became a hotel.\\\\- Montgreenan Hotel The building is Category A listed by Historic Scotland. Alexander Craufurd of Fergushill inherited Fergushill from his father and it next passed by inheritance to the Kincaid family who alienated the lands to Neil Macvicar and his wife Elizabeth Montgomerie in 1728. The Macvicars retained the lands until 1802 when they were acquired by Robert Glasgow of Montgreenan.Paterson, James (1899) History of the County of Ayr with a Genealogical account of the families of Ayrshire. Vol. 2. Pub. Thomas George Stevenson, Edinburgh. P. 504. Archibald Stevenson acquired Montgreenan in 1755 and sold it to Mr. Bowman in 1778, a Provost of Glasgow and builder of Ashgrove House at Ashinyards near Kilwinning.McClure, David (2002). Ayrshire in the Age of Improvement. Ayrshire Monographs 27. Ayr Arch & Nat Hist Soc. . Page 166 The estate had a curling pond, a fine stable block, offices, a mains farm and a walled garden. The buildings still survive as private dwellings (2008). Caven Mill is likely to have been the barony mill to which the tenants were thirled; this building is now a ruin. =Corporal John Smith= A memorial stone to Corporal John Smith at Montgreenan old castle. An unusual memorial is located next to the ruins of the Bishop's Palace or Castle of Montgreenan. The memorial is formed from glazed fireclay much like that used for wall coping stones and pipes and has the appearance of a corbel laid horizontally. The oblong structure has crossed canons at one end and bunches of olive or laurel leaves at the other end. The scroll on the upper surface reads \\"3219 - John Smith - Corporal - Co. B. 10th Ohio Vol - Died 25th Novr - 1863 - Chattanooga - Tenn\\". It appears therefore that John died whilst fighting in the Chattanooga Campaign of November 1863 and being in the Ohio Volunteers he was on the Union side and not a Confederate soldier. It can be surmised that John Smith had a close link with the Montgreenan estate. =The Montgreenan milestones= Beside the driveways running to the Montgreenan mansion house from the Lodges are a number of red sandstone pillars, these are milestones. They look like gatepost-like and were 'rescued' after they became redundant or 'in the way' as a result of road widening works, etc. They have been brought from various places in Ayrshire. Sir James Bell of Montgreenan had a hobby of collecting milestones and other stones.Houston, John (1922), Montgreenan and Lylestone Quarry, 23 September 1922. Annals of the Kilmarnock Glenfield Ramblers Society. 1919 - 1930. P. 85. Many Ayrshire milestones were buried during the Second World War as an invasion precaution. Two are near the West Lodge and three of these milestones are near the East Lodge at Montgreenan Mains.

Montgreenan West Lodge. The 1858 OS map shows a carriage or driveway running from close to the surviving Auchentiber schoolhouse on the Lochlibo road, passed the old Murchland farm site (Murghland in 1747; Murchen is the Scots for a hare) through the Montgreenan plantations, crossing the road near Cavan Mill and finally running on down to Montgreenan house. A track and later a road ran from Auchenharvie Castle across the Lochlibo toll road and up to Megswells (Meggs Walls in 1747), crossing the Lugton Water by stepping stones and later by a ford. This route ran under the aforementioned Montgreenan carriageway via a bridge which has an embankment leading up to it. The area near the old Mosside farm has been the site of several limestone quarries and limekilns in 1858 (OS), but by 1897 these had closed. Mosside bridge is of a very high quality of workmanship and ornamentation. It has false windows, diamond / lozenge shaped embellishments, a thistle on the keystones and raised random patterns and other designs which represent leaves. The Ness Papers state that the false windows were for the insertion of a coat of arms and that the old coach road ran across this bridge on its way to Cavan Mill and beyond.The James Ness papers.

Pate was normally a still, dour man, but on this occasion he was highly animated and took the doctor to see the long dead corpse of a 'bonnie lady' lying in a hole in the peat. She was around 18 to 20 years of age, had rosy cheeks, a sweet smile playing around her lips and blonde hair. Her identity was unknown, but a rumour linked her to the family of the Montgreenan estate. Natural history Greater Woodrush (Luzula sylvatica)in Spring.

Legends and archaeology It is said that a large part of the monks treasure from Kilwinning Abbey was found at Montgreenan circa 1740 by the laird, consisting of seven crocks of coins, rings, brooches, candlesticks, crosses, necklasses, pomanders, beads, etc.Service (1913), Page 10 A local legend was that Alexander Cunninghame, the commendator of the abbey and living at Montgreenan had buried the abbey treasure, knowing that his life was in danger following the murder of the 4th Earl of Eglinton. He was murdered at the entrance to his home in 1586 and his ghost was said to protect the treasure.Service (1890), Pages 47 - 69 John Smith in 1895 recorded that a pot of silver coins was found in the Chapel Park, on Montgreenan lands (NS 343 445). The existence of a pre- reformation chapel is not recorded other than this field name record. Micro history The OS maps show that Benslie village was named 'Montgreenan' up until at least 1938, with the name Benslie given to the wood, the old farmhouse on the 'island' created by the three roads and the term Benslie Square. The postal address may have been the direct cause of the name change, preventing confusion with the Montgreenan estate. Auchentiber mainstreet looking towards the main road. The Torranyard Inn.

He moved from Finland to the United States in 1976.Closing In on Cancer : In Search of a Cure, a La Jolla Research Center Reaches Into the Outer Limits Los Angeles Times Ruoslahti made seminal contributions to biology of extracellular matrix and its receptors. He was one of the discoverers of fibronectin, an adhesion molecule and component of extracellular matrices, and he subsequently identified and cloned a number of other extracellular matrix components and adhesion molecules. In 1984, he identified the sequence within fibronectin that mediates cell attachment, called RGD for the amino acids of which it’s composed, and isolated the cellular receptors that bind that sequence, now known as integrins. The RGD discovery has led to the development of drugs for vascular thrombosis and cancer, among other diseases. Ruoslahti currently studies specific marker molecules in blood vessels. He introduced the concept of vascular \\"zip codes,\\" the idea that each tissue bears molecular signatures that can be targeted by affinity ligands, and used in vivo peptide phage display to prove the concept and develop numerous tumor-homing peptides. Education Ruoslahti received his M.D. from the University of Helsinki in 1965 and his Ph.D. from the same institution in 1967. He completed postdoctoral studies at Caltech. Career Ruoslahti held various academic appointments with the University of Helsinki and the University of Turku in Finland and City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, California until joining the La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation (now Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, or SBP) in 1979. He served as SBP's president from 1989-2002, and was a distinguished professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara from 2005-2015. Recent work on homing peptides and nanomedicine Ruoslahti's research group has developed a novel class of tumor-homing peptides that can be used to enhance delivery of drugs and nanoparticles to tumors. These tumor-penetrating peptides selectively home to tumor vessels, where they activate a transport pathway that delivers the peptide, and along with it drugs and even nanoparticles, through the wall of tumor blood vessels and deep into tumor tissue. Having bound to tumor vessels the peptide is cleaved and an amino acid sequence motif named the C-end rule or CendR motif (pronounced \\"sender\\") is exposed at the C-terminus of the peptide. Subsequent binding of the peptide to neuropilin-1 activates the CendR transport pathway into and through tumor tissue. The prototype tumor-penetrating peptide, iRGD, is in clinical trials in solid tumor patients tested as an enhancer of cancer therapies. This peptide recognizes many different types of cancers, and it can be used for tumor delivery of various payloads that are either coupled to the peptide, or given together with it. iRGD has also been shown to effectively deliver drugs to the placenta, which could aid in the treatment of slow fetal growth. Recently, in vivo phage screening has been used to identify peptides that target hypertensive pulmonary arteries, atherosclerosis, and diseases of the brain.

When it comes to religion, the Ecuadorian society is relatively homogeneous, with Christianity being the primary religion. Roman Catholicism is the main Christian denomination in the country. However, affiliation with Protestant churches is increasing. There are many old and new churches throughout the country and many more are being built by the Catholic Church. The Evangelical Missionary Union represents many Protestants in Ecuador; Anglican churches in Ecuador belong to Province 9 of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. Other religions are present in small numbers: Eastern Orthodoxy, Mormonism, Buddhism, Judaism, Hinduism and Islam.  Statistics  According to Latinobarómetro’s 2018 public opinion survey, approximately 92 percent of respondents have a religious affiliation or belief. Of those, 74.8 percent is Catholic; 15.2 percent evangelical Christian (including evangelical Baptists and Methodists); and 1.2 percent Jehovah’s Witnesses. Approximately 1.4 percent identify as members of other religious groups, including Seventh-day Adventists, the Church of Jesus Christ, Jews, and Protestants. Of those who do not identify with a religion, .8 percent identify as atheists while 6.1 percent have no religion. According to the Ecuadorian National Institute of Statistics and Census in 2012 (the most recent year for which there are government statistics available), approximately 92 percent of the population professes a religious affiliation or belief. 80.4% are Roman Catholic, 11.3% are Protestants, 1.29% are Jehovah's Witnesses, and 6.96 have other religion of none.

After the Spanish colonization, Ecuador became a Roman Catholic country. The Catholic Church had and still has an important place in the Ecuadorian government and society. After the Constitution of 1869, the official religion became CatholicismEcuador and the Catholic Church and only Catholics could obtain citizenship. In 1899, the liberal government of Alfaro made a new constitution which respected all religions and guaranteed freedom of religious choice. The public education became free of religious influence. Nevertheless, private catholic schools still existed. Monsignor Antonio José Cardinal González Zumárraga is the emeritus Archbishop of Quito. He is in charge of the Ecuadorian Catholic Church.

Ecuador has now about 11% of the population calling itself protestant. Most are Pentecostals, but many denominations are active. =Latter-day Saints= The Guayaquil Ecuador Temple (Mormon) The first Mormon missionaries in Ecuador arrived in 1965. On August 1, 1999, the Guayaquil Ecuador Temple was dedicated by President Gordon B. Hinckley. Latter-day Saint membership in Ecuador has increased significantly in recent years. In 2008, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints reported having 185,663 members in Ecuador.LDS Newsroom =Apostolics= 50th Anniversary Celebration The \\"Jesus Name Apostolic Church of Ecuador\\" (Iglesia Evangelica Apostolica del Nombre de Jesus) is the largest Apostolic/Pentecostal church in Ecuador with more than 100,000 members in Ecuador.

Judaism The \\"Jewish Community of Ecuador\\" (Comunidad Judía del Ecuador) has its seat in Quito and has approximately 290 members. Nevertheless, this number is declining because young people leave the country towards the United States of America or Israel.Ecuadorian Jewish Community The Community has a Jewish Center with a synagogue, a country club and a cemetery. It supports the \\"Albert Einstein School\\", where Jewish history, religion and Hebrew classes are offered. There is a very small community in Cuenca.

The Islamic Center \\"Al Hijra\\" is located in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city and economic hub, with an estimated 85 members. Baháʼí Faith The Baháʼí Faith, while being registered with the government, has small numbers in the country. The Baháʼí radio station in Otavalo, which started on October 12, 1977, was the first Baháʼí radio station in the world. The National Bahá'í governing body of Ecuador is based in Quito and Guayaquil.Baháʼí Community of Ecuador Buddhism Buddhism was originally brought to Ecuador by immigrants from China and Japan. A large number of these immigrants and their descendants have retained their native religions with approximately 5,000 practicing Buddhists. In 1995 Taiwanese missionaries began building the Templo Mision Budista in Guayaquil. Finished in 2007, it opened its doors to the public in 2008 and is one of the largest Buddhist temples in South America. History =In the colony= The Roman Catholic Church assumed a pivotal role in Ecuador virtually at the onset of the Spanish conquest. Catholicism was a central part of Hispanic culture, defining the ethos and worldview of the time. Through the Office of the Inquisition, the church examined the \\"purity\\" of possible officeholders. The church was virtually the only colonial institution dealing with education or the care of the needy. It amassed great wealth through donations, dowries, and outright purchases. Virtually every segment of the organization—the hierarchy, individual clerics, and religious orders—owned some form of assets.Kluck, Patricia. \\"Religion\\". A Country Study: Ecuador (Dennis M. Hanratty, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (1989). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. =After the independence= Latacunga's Church The liberals' ascendancy in 1905 brought a series of drastic limitations to the Roman Catholic Church's privileges. The state admitted representatives of other religions into the country, established a system of public education, and seized most of the church's rural properties. In addition, legislation formally abolished tithes (although many hacienda owners continued to collect them). The 1945 constitution (and the Constitution of 1979) firmly established freedom of religion and the separation of church and state. =Changes in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s= Beginning in the 1960s, the country's Catholic bishops became increasingly active in supporting social change. Church leaders organized literacy campaigns among the Indians, distributed the institution's remaining lands, assisted peasants in acquiring land titles, and helped communities form cooperatives. In the 1970s and 1980s, the bishops espoused a centrist position on social and political issues. The episcopate contended that the unjust organization of Ecuadorian society caused many to live in misery. The bishops also claimed that the economic development of the 1970s and early 1980s had merely widened the gap between rich and poor. At the same time, however, Catholics were warned against employing Marxian analyses of society or endorsing violence or class conflict. =Church support for social reform= Church support for social reform occasionally brought it into conflict with government authorities. In 1976, for example, police arrested Riobamba bishop Leonidas Proaño Villalba—the episcopate's most outspoken critic of Ecuadorian society and politics—and sixteen other Latin American bishops who were attending a church conference in Chimborazo Province. After accusing the prelates of interfering in Ecuador's internal politics and discussing subversive subjects, the minister of interior released Proaño and expelled the foreign bishops from the country. Some Catholics formed groups to support conservative causes. The Committee of Young Christians for Christian Civilization, for example, advocated scuttling the \\"confiscatory and anti- Christian\\" agrarian reform laws. Internal organization of the Catholic Church in Ecuador In 1986 the Roman Catholic Church was organized into three archdioceses, ten dioceses, one territorial prelature, seven apostolic vicariates, and one apostolic prefecture. The church had only 1,505 priests to minister to a Catholic population of slightly more than 8 million, a ratio of 1 priest for every 5,320 Catholics. Although approximately 94 percent of Ecuadorians were at least nominally Roman Catholic at the time, most either did not practice their religion or pursued a syncretistic version. Most Sierra Indians, for example, followed a type of folk Catholicism in which doctrinal orthodoxy played only a small part. Indigenous beliefs combined with elements of Catholic worship. Much of community life focused on elaborate fiestas that marked both public and family events. Although the precise configuration of fiestas varied from community to community, in general public fiestas involved an individual in a series of increasingly demanding and expensive sponsorships (cargos) of specific religious celebrations. By the time individuals had completed all the expected cargos, they were recognized community leaders. Religious freedom The separation of state and religion is since 1986 guaranteed. The Ecuadorian Constitution of 1998 includes two articles providing for freedom of worship: * Art. 23: States, among others that \\"all people are legally born free and equal and that they will not be discriminated on the basis of religion\\". It guarantees also the freedom of religion. \\"Freedom of religion is guaranteed. Every individual has the right to freely profess his/her religion and to disseminate it individually or collectively. All religious faiths and churches are equally free before the law.\\" The right to declare or not about ones religious affiliation is also guaranteed. * Art. 81: Prohibits publicity that encourages violence, racism, sexism, religious or political intolerance. Conversions The Roman Catholic Church's relatively weak presence in the countryside and in squatter settlements, coupled with the nominal, syncretistic practice of most Catholics, created a fertile ground for Protestant evangelical and Pentecostal missionary activity. Although multidenominational groups such as the Gospel Missionary Union (GMU) had been active in Ecuador since the beginning of the twentieth century, significant levels of conversion did not occur until the late 1960s. By the late 1970s, the GMU reported that it had converted 20,000 Sierra Indians in Chimborazo Province alone. The Christian and Missionary Alliance indicated that conversions among Indians in Otavalo climbed from 28 in 1969 to 900 in 1979. By the mid-1980s, an estimated 50,000 Ecuadorians had converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Other significant forces in the Protestant camp included World Vision, an evangelical development group based in California, and the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL). The Texas-based SIL dispatched linguists to remote areas of Ecuador to study and codify tribal languages. The eventual goal of such efforts was to translate the Bible. The phenomenal pace of conversion — some observers estimated that evangelicals and Pentecostals totaled 40 percent of the population in Chimborazo Province in the late 1980s — affected social relations in rural areas. Change in religious affiliation was a major rupture with an individual's past traditions and social ties, effectively removing him or her from participation in fiestas—a major focus of much of community life. Families and extended families found the break with the rest of the community easier in the company of fellow converts. Protestantism replaced the patterns of mutual reciprocity characteristic of peasant social relations with a network of sharing and support among fellow believers. This support system extended to migrants; converts who left for the city or the coast sought out their coreligionists for assistance in finding lodging and employment even as Catholics looked to their compadres.

The role is often performed by the Deputy Prime Minister (where that position exists), or by another senior minister. The office is commonly used when the Prime Minister is absent from the territory of that nation or when the Prime Minister is unable to perform duties for health reasons. An Acting Prime Minister should be distinguished from a Caretaker Prime Minister, which refers to an Outgoing Prime Minister following an electoral defeat, and who by convention does not implement new policies or an Interim Prime Minister who is appointed to perform a similar role to a Caretaker Prime Minister, but who is typically not a Prime Minister at the time of being appointed. Statutory authority Within a Commonwealth nation, the office of Acting Prime Minister like that of Prime Minister is found only in convention, and is not legislated. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, or an equivalent ministry, drafts, reviews and publishes any formal conventions (though these are expressly non binding in a court of law). By country =Australia= According to House of Representatives Practice, an official publication of the Parliament of Australia, the Prime Minister of Australia \\"may make temporary ministerial arrangements without reference to the Governor-General. A Minister may act for another Minister on account of absence from Australia or from the Ministry or due to ill health. The Acts Interpretation Act confers upon an Acting Minister the same power and authority with respect to the absent Minister's statutory responsibilities.\\"Chapter 2 House, Government and Opposition, House of Representative Practice (5th edition). Published by the Parliament of Australia. The position of acting prime minister is a special case of an acting minister, and generally occurs when the prime minister is travelling overseas, is on vacation, or is in ill health. In the early 20th century, when travel by ship was still the norm, it was not uncommon for there to be an acting prime minister for months on end. The deputy prime minister is usually designated as the acting prime minister, although another senior member of the government may fill the role if both the prime minister and deputy prime minister are unavailable. An acting prime minister is required quite frequently – for instance, between 3 December 2007 and 23 February 2009 (during Kevin Rudd's first term), Julia Gillard acted as prime minister on 16 separate occasions.Dates and individuals who acted as Acting Prime Minister The term acting prime minister is sometimes also applied to someone who is temporarily appointed Prime Minister following a death in office (more commonly called a caretaker prime minister or an interim prime minister). Examples include Frank Forde (seven days following John Curtin's death), Earle Page (19 days following Joseph Lyons' death), and John McEwen (22 days following Harold Holt's disappearance). Unlike those who merely acted in the absence of a prime minister, Forde, Page and McEwen were officially commissioned by the Governor General and took the oath of office; they are considered prime ministers in their own right. =Canada= In Canada, the Deputy Prime Minister—a position that is not always in use—becomes acting head of government in the event that the Prime Minister is absent from Canada or incapacitated. Prior to the creation of the Deputy Prime Minister position, acting prime ministers were routinely appointed when prime ministers were temporarily away from their duties; however, prime ministers typically appointed a different cabinet member each time, rather than designating one specific person as a permanent official \\"deputy\\". In February 1958, Prime Minister John Diefenbaker appointed Ellen Fairclough as acting Prime Minister for two days while he was absent from his duties; Fairclough was historically noteworthy as the first woman ever given the duty.\\"As Acting Prime Minister Ellen Fairclough First Again\\". The Globe and Mail, February 21, 1958. =Israel= The designated Acting Prime Minister takes the role of Prime Minister as Acting Prime Minister, for up to one hundred consecutive days, if the incumbent is temporarily incapacitated. Whilst in other countries the term \\"Acting Prime Minister\\" only refers to an individual actually performing the role, in Israel the term is also in use when a designated Minister is allocated, even if they never actually perform the role. =New Zealand= In New Zealand, the Acting Prime Minister is the designated head of government when the incumbent is not available to fulfill their duties. This includes when the Prime Minister is overseas, unwell, or otherwise temporarily unavailable. Typically this position is filled by the Deputy Prime Minister. Hugh Watt, who was then the Deputy Prime Minister, served as Acting Prime Minister for six days, after Norman Kirk died in office in 1974. Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters was serving as Acting Prime Minister as of 21 June 2018 until 2 August 2018, while Jacinda Ardern took maternity leave. Prior to the establishment of the Deputy Prime Minister role, a senior Minister would be appointed to act as Prime Minister when, for example, the incumbent was travelling overseas. In the current era, when both the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister are unavailable, the next highest ranking minister who is available will be asked to act as Prime Minister, until a colleague of higher rank is available again. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, the post of Deputy Prime Minister is non-concurrent but is the de facto second in Government. Where there is no Deputy Prime Minister, the First Secretary of State typically deputises for the Prime Minister. On 6 April 2020, Prime Minister, Boris Johnson was admitted to intensive care at St Thomas Hospital, London after contracting COVID-19. First Secretary of State, Dominic Raab was formally asked to 'deputise where necessary' due to the ill-health of the incumbent Prime Minister, but was not formally made Acting Prime Minister.

Monument to Col. Oscar Malmborg and those in the 55th Illinois Infantry who died at Vicksburg National Military Park During the Battle of Shiloh after Colonel David Stuart was badly wounded, Malmborg assumed temporary command of the Second Brigade of the Fifth Division commanded by Brigadier General William T. Sherman. In the advance on Corinth, Mississippi, Malmborg correctly predicted what the Confederate forces were attempting. In an official report on April 10, 1862, Colonel Stuart wrote of Malmborg, \\"He instantly perceived the aim of every movement made by the enemy; he could advise me quickly and prudently how to use my men. He was intent, careful, brave, and immensely valuable to me.\\" General Ulysses S. Grant took notice and complimented him. After Stuart resigned on April 3, 1863, Malmborg became the permanent commander until being relieved. He resigned on September 20, 1864. On January 1, 1865, Malmborg was commissioned a colonel in the First Veteran Army Corps under General Winfield Scott Hancock and was ordered to oversee the recruiting in Illinois, with headquarters in Chicago once again.

The feathered cloaks and capes were believed to provide spiritual protection for Hawaiian chiefs.https://deyoung.famsf.org/exhibitions/featherwork There are over 160 examples of this traditional clothing in museums around the world. At least six of these cloaks were collected during the voyages of Captain Cook. These cloaks are made from a woven netting decorated with bird feathers and are examples of fine featherwork techniques. One of these cloaks was included in a painting of Cook's death by Johann Zoffany. Construction The cloaks were constructed using a woven netting decorated with feathers obtained from local birds. The plant used to make the netting is Touchardia latifolia, a member of the nettle family. The coloring was achieved using different types of feathers. Black and yellow came from four species of bird called ōōs. All species had become extinct by 1987, with the probable cause being disease. Black feathers were also sourced from the two species of mamo, which are also now both extinct. The distinctive red feathers came from the Iiwi and the Apapane. Both species can still be found in Hawaii, but in much reduced numbers. Although birds were exploited for their feathers, the effect on the population is thought to be minimal. The birds are said to have not been killed but, rather, caught by specialist bird catchers, a few feathers harvested, and the birds then released. Hundreds of thousands of feathers were required for each cloak. A small bundle of feathers was gathered and tied into the netting. Bundles were tied in close proximity to form a uniform covering of the surface of the cloak. Captain James Cook's cloak The feather cape given to Captain Cook. When Captain James Cook visited Hawaii on 26 January 1778 he was received by a high chief called Kalaniʻōpuʻu. At the end of the meeting Kalaniʻōpuʻu placed the feathered helmet and cloak he had been wearing on Cook. Kalaniʻōpuʻu also laid several other cloaks at Cook's feet as well as four large pigs and other offerings of food. Much of the material from Cook's voyages including the helmet and cloak ended up in the collection of Sir Ashton Lever. He exhibited them in his museum, the Holophusikon. It was while at this museum that Cook's mahiole and cloak were borrowed by Johann Zoffany in the 1790s and included in his painting of the Death of Cook. Lever went bankrupt and his collection was disposed of by public lottery. The collection was obtained by James Parkinson who continued to exhibit it, at the Blackfriars Rotunda. He eventually sold the collection in 1806 in 7,000 separate sales. The mahiole and cloak were purchased by the collector William Bullock who exhibited them in his own museum until 1819 when the collection was again sold. The mahiole and cloak were then purchased by Charles Winn along with a number of other items and these remained in his family until 1912, when Charles Winn's grandson, the Second Baron St Oswald, gave them to the Dominion of New Zealand.

A mostly silent character, his lone vocal characteristic (a rattling of Perry's beak) is provided by Dee Bradley Baker. Perry is the only pet of the Flynn-Fletcher family, and is perceived as mindless and domesticated. In secret, however, he lives a double life as a member of an all-animal espionage organization referred to as O.W.C.A. (Organization Without a Cool Acronym). Many secret entrances to his underground lair exist all around the house; such as the side of the house, most notably the tree that his owners sit under in the backyard, and several other everyday objects that seem to elude the family's attention. Perry also has entrances in Hawaii, London and South Dakota. He engages in daily battles with Doofenshmirtz, an evil scientist who desires to take over the Tri-state area with obscure contraptions that work perfectly according to his intended function but fail in his application of them every time. Perry was made a platypus because of the animal's striking appearance and the lack of public knowledge of the animal, which allowed the writers to make things up about the species. Critical reception for the character from both professionals and fans have been considerably positive. Merchandising of the character include plush toys, t-shirts, wooden toys, glasses, and coloring books, along with appearances in literature and a 2009 video game for the Nintendo DS. Role in Phineas and Ferb Perry in his \\"normal\\" platypus stance. Perry is the docile pet platypus of the blended Flynn-Fletcher family, who adopted him because his unfocused gaze made it seem as if he were looking at both Phineas and Ferb at the same time, as shown in the 2011 movie, Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension. Unbeknownst to them, Perry lives a double life as a crime-fighting spy working for the \\"Organization Without a Cool Acronym\\"/The OWCA, going by the codename \\"Agent P.\\" He reports to his superior, Major Monogram, via telecast in his large, high-tech, underground hideout. Every day, he engages in battles with the evil scientist Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, who tries using inventions to take over the tri-state area. Perry is always able to foil Doofenshmirtz's plans and in doing so accidentally leads to the destruction of whatever form of contraption his owners, Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher, are building in order to make summer better. Phineas and Ferb are aware that something happens to get rid of their scheme for the day, but do not know that Perry is the cause behind it and are largely dismissive of it. Their sister, Candace, also does not know that Perry is behind the destruction and is driven to near insanity trying to figure it out. Throughout the series, Perry is aware of Phineas and Ferb's inventions, but is largely uninterested in them, save whenever he notices that their latest invention may help him thwart Doofenshmirtz. Perry and Doofenshmirtz at first seem to loathe each other in the beginning of the series, and have been arch-nemeses since the day they met. However, they are often cordial and friendly towards one another and it is said by Doofenshmirtz that Perry is his best friend, and Perry will often act to save Doofenshmirtz's life when his plot inevitably blows up in his face. Doofenshmirtz also went out of his way in one episode to become closer to Perry after he is assigned to a new villain. Habitually, their daily brawls involve Doofenshmirtz devising a scheme, which Perry goes to stop after being briefed by Major Monogram. He is trapped by Doofenshmirtz while trying to do so and is told of the doctor's scheme, usually pertaining to some backstory or pet peeve. He then escapes and the two fight, Perry coming out victorious with Doofenshmirtz yelling \\"Curse you, Perry the Platypus!\\". The two rely on this daily structure, Doofenshmirtz even specifically mentioning it in \\"Journey to the Center of Candace\\" and in episodes such as \\"It's About Time!\\" in which Doofenshmirtz temporarily replaces Perry with secret agent Peter The Panda and they become depressed about not having each other to fight. Perry realizes he misses Doof too. When Perry does not arrive on the scene of Doofenshmirtz's evil plan, the doctor hesitates to execute his plans and fears for where Perry has gone, though he notes that he \\"hopes something terrible has happened to him.\\". Sometimes, they decided not to fight and have fun, as shown in \\"Happy New Year!\\" and \\"Candace Disconnected\\". On other occasions, depending on whatever situation Doofenshmirtz is facing, Perry would often help Doofenshmirtz with his non-evil plans, such as helping him overcome evil scientist's block, helping him put on a birthday party for his 16-year-old daughter Vanessa, impressing a square dancing girl with programmable square dancing boots that Doofenshmritz created, working together to stop a raging platypus hunter from hunting them down, or helping him convince his rich ex- wife to help pay off his mortgage debt. Also, Perry tends to use Doofenshmirtz's inventions to erase evidence of whatever contraptions Phineas and Ferb had made, leaving Candace unable to bust them. Examples include when Perry asked to borrow Doofenshmirtz's robot Norm to pick up footage from the city surveillance cameras in order to preserve his job as an agent, as well as using Doofenshmirtz's Pick-Him-Up-inator to rescue a lost Candace and bring her home. In Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension, an alternate reality (yet more evil and ruthless) version of Perry (known as Platyborg) appears. Platyborg would later return in the episode sequel, Tales from the Resistance: Back to the 2nd Dimension. Perry's secret would be revealed to Phineas, Ferb, their friends, and Dr. Doofenshmirtz and got their memories erased in order for Phineas and Ferb to keep Perry as a pet. Role in Milo Murphy's Law Perry first shows up in The Phineas and Ferb Effect, and becomes a recurring character. Over the course of the second season, he is tasked with watching over Dr. Doofenshmirtz as he attempts (and fails) to do good around Danville. Doofenshmirtz is at first oblivious to this mission and assumes to Perry is being his friend, and so pushes him away upon finding out. They eventually reconcile and Perry reveals his intentions to donate his earnings towards Doofenshmirtz's cause. Character =Creation and conception= Original storyboard artwork for Perry in the pilot episode \\"Rollercoaster.\\" While working on the animated television series Rocko's Modern Life, Phineas and Ferb co-creators Dan Povenmire and Jeff \\"Swampy\\" Marsh utilized several recurring elements in the episodes that they wrote. Among these were actions sequences and chase scenes. Povenmire and Marsh wanted to reuse these elements in their series and chose Perry to execute it. The pair gave him a consistent and continuous nemesis in the form of Doofenshmirtz as a means of allowing viewers to get to know him. While choosing a species for Perry, Povenmire and Marsh wanted to keep in mind selecting one that was uncommon, an animal that kids could not \\"pick out at a pet store and beg [their parents] for.\\" They chose a platypus because of the animal's obscure and striking appearance. The animal was scarcely used in American animated programs, so the pair opined that Perry \\"would not have to compete with preconceived notions that viewers might bring to a more conventional critter.\\" The blank storyboard they were given allowed them to \\"make stuff up\\" since \\"no one knows very much about [them].\\" Perry has a theme song tentatively entitled \\"Perry,\\" performed by Randy Crenshaw and Laura Dickinson, and written by Povenmire and Marsh, who write the majority of songs in the series. The song, along with the number \\"Gitchee Gitchee Goo\\" from the episode \\"Flop Starz,\\" was the first musical composition Povenmire and Marsh pitched to The Walt Disney Company. They were nervous doing so, because, as Povenmire explained, \\"Disney has a big history of music  what if they hate it?\\" Their reaction, however, was considerably positive and the pair was asked to write a song for each episode, which they vehemently agreed to. The opening lyrics for the song describe Perry as a standard textbook definition of a platypus: \\"He's a semi-aquatic egg-laying mammal of action.\\" =Design= Like the other characters of the series, Perry was structured in a simple style to allow young viewers to easily draw him. In keeping with the show's general design scheme, Perry is constructed of geometric shapes in a style reminiscent of Tex Avery's. Povenmire uses different design styles for drawing Perry depending on how he is portrayed. When Perry is portrayed as a domesticated and mindless pet, Povenmire begins with a square shaped like a loaf of bread. He then draws his front legs and feet before drawing his bill, which is set at a certain angle. Povenmire then draws his eyeballs, which are never focused and look in opposing directions in a daze. He concludes the figure by adding his hind legs, tail, hair, and finally color. When portrayed as a secret agent, Povenmire starts with a similar bread loaf square design, but draws it standing up vertically and places a fedora on the top of his head, which is combined with the square torso. In contrast to his mindless and wild-eyed expression as a pet, the secret agent version of Perry is detailed with eyes \\"full of steely blue resolve.\\" Povenmire proceeds by drawing his arms, with bare hands that are open and prepared for fighting or any danger. His legs are bent, as well prepared for an act of danger or action needed. Povenmire finishes the design by adding his beaver tail and color. =Personality= Dee Bradley Baker voices Perry. Perry's undercover identity as a pet leads to characters throughout the series to deem him as a \\"mindless domestic pet\\" that \\"doesn't do much\\". This definition of the character led to Phineas and Ferb spearheading production of a new toyline based on Perry called \\"Perry the Inaction Figure,\\" whose tagline revolved around it not doing anything but allowing the customer to make it whatever they desire it to be. In all actuality, Perry is a skilled fighter who is able to perform several implausible judo fighting moves and escapes. He has access to several different types of technology and inventions provided to him by The O.W.C.A., including a hover craft dubbed the \\"Platypusmobile,\\" a jet ski, and a whistle set that allows him to summon different types of animals. His favorite color is perry-winkle. Although his appearance as a domestic pet is mostly a cover, Perry has nonetheless expressed care and devotion for the Flynn-Fletcher family. In the episode \\"The Ballad of Bad Beard\\", Perry managed to drag Candace out of the Dark Cave before it caved in because of Dr. Doofenshmirtz's \\"self destruction button\\" that which Candace had accidentally pressed while under the orange moss hallucination, thinking it was a vending machine. He did this even though he knew that Candace saw that Perry was a secret agent talking to Agent E (Eagle) and to Major Monogram in a cracked egg. Candace thought she was just hallucinating because of the orange moss she accidentally touched earlier in the episode. Also, when an invention of Doofenshmirtz's in the episode \\"Journey to the Center of Candace\\" might cause severe harm to Phineas and Ferb, Perry thoroughly beats up Doofenshmirtz and quickly handcuffs him. He then ties him to a pipe and, instead of just leaving him like he usually does in the series, calls for special forces from the O.W.C.A. to come and arrest the doctor, though they never show up. In \\"Oh, There You Are, Perry,\\" Doofenshmirtz is downgraded to a low threat level and Perry is reassigned to a new nemesis. This causes him to have to leave his home with the Flynn-Fletchers, which makes him sad and he does not enjoy his new villain. Phineas and Ferb are fearful about where Perry could have gone to and put up several flyers around town for people to find him. They decide to throw a concert on the roof of a building, singing a song about how much they love Perry and want him to come home. Concurrently, Perry is reassigned to Doofenshmirtz again and returns to the brothers once more. Though Perry is anthropomorphic, he does not speak, only communicating through an \\"aggravated purr\\" type of noise made by flapping his bill. This noise is provided by actor Dee Bradley Baker; to this day, Povenmire and Marsh do not understand how Baker produces the noise. Thomas Sangster, who plays Ferb, is notoriously good at making the noise and is considered second only to Baker himself. When in his \\"Agent P\\" persona, Perry is almost completely silent and communicates only by body language, facial expressions, hand gestures and occasionally pantomime. Reception As a character, Perry has been well received by both fans and critics. As Cynthia Littleton of Variety magazine wrote, \\"Perry the platypus is a breakout star from the Disney Channel toon 'Phineas and Ferb.'\\" The New York Times writer Susan Stewart called him \\"intrepid.\\" Jean Yoo, a press member for Disney Channel, said that Perry is \\"suave\\" and \\"makes James Bond look like a rank amateur.\\" Aaron H. Bynum of Animator Insider opined that he is \\"indubitably confident.\\" Carly H. of Scholastic, Inc. declared Perry \\"pretty darn awesome.\\" Josh Jackson, editor of Paste, described Perry and Doofenshmirtz's relationship as \\"pitch-perfect.\\" Certain reviewers have also commented negatively about Perry and his subplot, which Sherry Robinson of the St. Petersburg Times considers \\"pretty trippy.\\" Kevin McDonough of Sun Coast Today described it as \\"complicated\\" and \\"loosely connected\\" to the rest of the series, writing that he is \\"not sure what this accomplishes except to add the noise of explosions to the already constant din of singing and screaming.\\" Ed Liu of Toon Zone feels it is \\"truly puzzling what Perry the secret agent is doing in this show in the first place.\\" Liu considers his subplot to be a type of \\"throw everything against the wall and see what sticks\\" element and writes that \\"many of the earlier episodes of the show don't manage to do a very good job of balancing the subplot and the main one.\\" Perry was nominated for a Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award in 2014 under the category of Favorite Animated Animal Sidekick. In other media In addition to the main television series, Perry has appeared in several pieces of Phineas and Ferb merchandise. To date, he has appeared in all Phineas and Ferb novelizations, published by Disney Press. The character has been adapted into a 20-inch plush toy, released by The Walt Disney Company. The plush has a button on its hand that allows it to emit Perry's signature chattering noise. Certain t-shirts based on the series released by both Disney and the online retail website Zazzle also display Perry and the phrase \\"Hey, where's Perry?\\" which most characters like Phineas, Isabella, Stacy, Irving, Ferb, and Lawrence utter when Perry goes to Major Monogram in his secret lair in almost every episode. There also is a T-shirt with Perry's face. Perry appears in the Nintendo DS video game based on the series, simply titled Phineas and Ferb, where a mini-game involves Perry stopping Doofenshmirtz's latest evil scheme. As of April 1, 2014, Perry is also a playable character in the video game Disney Infinity. He also appears in the Where's My Water?: Swampy's Underground Adventures episode \\"Double Trouble\\". He also appears in Milo Murphy's Law in a crossover special in the Season 2 premiere and becomes a recurring character throughout the season thereafter.

Despite a number of attempts to put the aircraft into series production, only a small number were ever built. The Canguro was a high-wing cantilever monoplane of conventional configuration with a fuselage of rectangular cross-section and a high-set tail. The tricycle undercarriage was not retractable, and its main units were carried on sponsons on the fuselage sides. SIAI Marchetti provided funding towards the construction of the prototype, and constructed this aircraft at the former Aviamilano plant. After flight testing proved positive, the type was put on sale, but failed to attract buyers in any number, even when the original piston engines were exchanged for turboprops and retractable undercarriage was offered as an option. Following their acquisition of SIAI Marchetti, Agusta continued to offer the design, and a contract for joint production was signed with Sammi in South Korea in 1992, but nothing came of this. A similar venture to produce the aircraft in conjunction with PADC in the Philippines proved similarly fruitless. PADC acquired two aircraft, RP-C1298 and RP-3101. In 1997, Vulcanair purchased the design from Finmeccanica (Agusta's parent company), but although a small number of examples were produced, no series production was undertaken. Vulcanair next proceeded to use the Canguro's fuselage to develop the single-engine Vulcanair Mission.

A subclass entity inherits all attributes and relationships of its superclass entity. This property is called the attribute and relationship inheritance. A subclass entity may have its own specific attributes and relationships (together with all the attributes and relationships it inherits from the superclass). A common superclass example is a Vehicle superclass along with the subclasses of Car and Truck. There are a number of common attributes between a car and a truck, which would be part of the superclass, while the attributes specific to a car or a truck (such as max payload, truck type...) would make up two subclasses.

The U.S. government could locate no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice during 2007 because it ignores the situation in public schools.International Religious Freedom Report 2007: Guyana. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Religious demography Data from a 2002 census on religious affiliation indicates that approximately 57 percent of the population is Christian: 17 percent Pentecostal, 8 percent Roman Catholic, 7 percent Anglican, 5 percent Seventh-day Adventist, and 20 percent other Christian groups. Approximately 28 percent is Hindu, 7 percent is Muslim (mostly Sunni), and 2 percent practice other beliefs, including the Rastafari movement and the Baháʼí Faith. An estimated 4 percent of the population does not profess any religion. The country is ethnically diverse, reflecting East Indian, African, Chinese, and European ancestry, as well as a significant indigenous population. Members of all ethnic groups are well represented in all religious groups, with two exceptions: most Hindus are Indo-Guyanese, and nearly all Rastafarians are Afro-Guyanese. Foreign missionaries from many religious groups are present. Status of religious freedom =Legal/policy framework= The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice. The Government at all levels sought to protect this right in full and did not tolerate its abuse, either by governmental or private actors. The law protects the right of individuals to choose and change their religion and to interpret their religious beliefs for themselves. Members of all religious groups worshiped freely. There is no state or otherwise dominant religion, and the Government practiced no form of religious favoritism or discrimination except for public schools, where Christianity is the only religion practice, school children are ask to recite Christian prayers throughout the day. While the Government recognizes religious groups of all faiths, they must register with the Government to receive formal recognition. Religious groups seeking to establish operations must first obtain permission from the Ministry of Home Affairs. In the past, access to Amerindian areas required permission from the Ministry of Amerindian Affairs and the Ministry of Home Affairs; however, under the 2006 revision of the Amerindian Act only the permission of the local Village Council is required. There is no formal monitoring of religious groups. The following holy days are national holidays: Christian-Good Friday, Easter, and Christmas; Hindu-Phagwah (festival welcoming spring) and Diwali (festival of lights); Islamic-You-Man-Nabi (birth of the Prophet Muhammad) and Eid Al-Adha (feast of sacrifice). Both public and religiously affiliated schools exist, and parents are free to send their children to the school of their choice without sanction or restriction, except the AFC-ANUP administration has imposed an 18% VAT/tax on students that choose to attend private school. The Government imposes no requirements regarding religion for any official or nonofficial purposes. =Restrictions on religious freedom= Government policy and practice contributed to the generally free practice of religion. The Guyana Defense Force (GDF) makes an effort to coordinate with civilian religious groups to provide personnel with access to religious services. Leaders of all major religious groups provided prayer and counseling, although generally only Christian sermons were given on GDF bases. Although no official GDF policy requires attendance at religious services, anecdotal evidence from GDF officers suggests that individual commanders required attendance at some religious programs. Membership in a particular religion did not confer any advantage or disadvantage; however, general military practice tended to be biased in favor of Christians. There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country or of forced religious conversion. Societal abuses and discrimination There were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice. =Promoting peace/Supporting harmony= The Inter-Religious Organization (IRO), a nongovernmental umbrella organization for Christian, Hindu, Islamic, and Baháʼí organizations, held events to promote peace during the August 2006 election.

Subsequently, the 100+ missionaries were ordered to leave the country within a month.

According to the 2012 census, approximately 63 percent of the population is Christian. The major groupings compose: *Pentecostal, 22.8% of the national population, increasing from 17% in 2002 *Anglican, 5.2%, decreasing from 7%, and *Seventh-day Adventist, 5.4%, increasing from 5% in 2002 *Roman Catholicism, 7.1%, decreasing from 8,1% *other Christian groups, 20.8%, increasing from 17.9%. According to the 2012 census, approximately 25 percent are Hindu, 7 percent are Muslim (mostly Sunni with Shia and Ahmadiyya minorities), and 1 percent practice other beliefs, including the Rastafari movement, Buddhism, and the Baháʼí Faith. More than 3 percent of the population do not profess any religion. Between 1991 and 2012, Hinduism, Islam, Catholicism and Mainline Protestant churches all saw significant decline as the national population grew by 3%. This is in contrast to Pentecostalism, which more than doubled, and less-established Christian groups, which nearly quadrupled in the same period. The country is ethnically diverse, reflecting East Indian, African, Chinese, and European ancestry, as well as a significant indigenous population. Members of all ethnic groups are well represented in all religious groups, with two exceptions: most Hindus are Indo-Guyanese, and nearly all Rastafarians are Afro-Guyanese. Foreign missionaries from many religious groups are present. Christianity's status as Guyana's dominant system of values is a consequence of colonial history. To the European planters, colonial administrators, and missionaries, the profession of Christian beliefs and observance of Christian practices were prerequisites to social acceptance. Even though the planters discouraged the teaching of their religion to the slaves, Christianity eventually became as much the religion of the Africans as of the Europeans. Indeed, after abolition, Christian institutions played an even more important role in the lives of the former slaves than in the lives of the masters. By the time the East Indians and other indentured groups arrived in Guyana, a new syncretic Afro-Guyanese culture in which Christianity played an important part had already been established. Only since the mid-20th century, with the growth of the Indo-Guyanese population and the efforts of their ethnic and religious organizations, have Muslim and Hindu values and institutions been recognized as having equal status with those of Guyana's Christians.Conway, Frederick J. \\"Religion\\" (and subsections). A Country Study: Guyana (Tim Merrill, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (January 1992). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Religions =Christianity= St. George's Anglican Cathedral, Georgetown, Guyana Among the Christian denominations active in Guyana in the 1990s, the Anglican Church claimed the largest membership: about 125,000 adherents as of 1986 though this had declined to about 40,000 in 2012. Anglicanism was the state religion of British Guiana until independence. The Roman Catholic Church had a membership of about 94,000 in 1985 which declined to about 53,000 in 2012. The majority of Roman Catholics lived in Georgetown, and the Portuguese were the most active members, although all the ethnic groups were represented. The Presbyterian Church was the third largest denomination, with nearly 39,000 members in 1980. Several other Christian churches had significant memberships in 1980, including the Methodists, Pentecostals, and Seventh-day Adventists, each of which had about 20,000 members. There were smaller numbers of Baptists, Jehovah's Witnesses, Congregationalists, Nazarenes, Moravians, Ethiopian Orthodox, and other mainstream Christians. Other sects in Guyana included the Rastafari movement which looks to Ethiopia for religious inspiration, and the Hallelujah Church, which combines Christian beliefs with Amerindian traditions. There were also at least 60,000 people describing themselves as Christian who had no formal church affiliation. Many rural villages and areas without churches have small gatherings with a group leader, sometimes unofficially called a \\"pastor\\" without affiliation to a specific or official Christian church, though most tend to be Baptist or Evangelical in nature. These groups would have \\"services\\", bible teachings and discussions at a neighbor's house or a provided empty location. Through organization, a village or a couple of villages might also provide Sunday School for children with a village member donating the space, many times the \\"bottom house\\", the empty space under a Guyanese house used for multiple purposes. =Hinduism= Central Vaidik Mandir in Georgetown The number of Guyanese practising Hinduism has been decreasing for many decades now, with 213,282 (28.4%) reported in 2002 against 253,065 (35.0%) in 1991. The majority of the East Indian immigrants were Hindu, and their dominant Status differences were attached and rituals varied . The hindus worshipped the classic pantheon of Vishnu and Shiva. Hinduism remains the predominant religion of the Indo-Guyanese, although it has been considerably modified. Hinduism stresses the festivities accompanying religious rites. Festivals may last several days and are usually held in times of crisis or prosperity. Because the sponsor of a festival provides a tent and feeds a large number of guests, orthodox Hindu rituals require considerable outlays of money. A Hindu family has difficulty fulfilling ritual obligations unless it has accumulated a surplus of cash. Since the late 1940s, reform movements have caught the attention of many Guyanese Hindus. The most important, the Arya Samaj movement (Aryan Society), was founded in India in 1875; the first Arya Samaj missionary arrived in Guyana in 1910. The movement preaches monotheism and opposition to the use of images in worship as well as many traditional Hindu rituals. =Islam= Guyana's Muslims can be organized into orthodox and reform movements. The Sunnatul Jamaat is the orthodox Sunni Islamic movement. The largest Islamic organization in the country is the Guyana United Sadr Islamic Anjuman. The Ahmadiyya sect of Islam, was founded in India in the late nineteenth century; its first missionary to Guyana arrived in 1908. The movement has had considerable success, even including some Afro-Guyanese among its converts. In contrast to the situation found on the Indian subcontinent, Muslims and Hindus experience little friction in Guyana. These two religious communities have a tacit agreement not to proselytize each other's members. In smaller villages, Hindus and Muslims come together to participate in each other's ceremonies. The Muslims are split into Shias, Sufis, Sunnis and Ahmadiyyas. Until the 1970s, Hindu and Muslim holidays were not officially recognized. A number of non-Christian religious days are now public holidays. Hindu holidays include Holi, the spring festival, and Divali, the festival of lights. Muslim holidays include Eid al-Fitr, the end of Ramadan, the sacred month of fasting; Eid al- Adha, the feast of sacrifice; and Mawlid, the birthday of Muhammad. The dates for these holidays vary. An East Indian heritage day is celebrated and on May 5, an Amerindian festival is held on Republic Day, in February. =Baháʼí Faith= The Baháʼí Faith is a relatively recent addition to the list of world religions represented in Guyana with the first local body (Local Spiritual Assembly) being established in Georgetown in 1955. National recognition came in 1976 when the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʼís of Guyana was incorporated by Act of Parliament. This body represents all Baháʼís in Guyana. The 2002 Census enumerated 500 Baháʼís. The Baháʼí community, while relatively small, is well known for its emphasis on unity, non-involvement in politics and its work in issues such as literacy and youth issues. In terms of religious practices and teachings, the Guyana Baháʼí community closely follows those of Baháʼí communities in other countries. =Judaism= Jews first came to Guyana in the 1660s, when Jewish settlers arrived in what was then the Dutch colony of Essequibo. Janet Jagan, an American-born Jewish woman, served as prime minister from March 17, 1997, to December 19, 1997, and as president of Guyana from December 19, 1997, to August 11, 1999. =Obeah= A number of folk beliefs continue to be practiced in Guyana. Obeah, a folk religion of African origin, incorporates beliefs and practices of all the immigrant groups. Obeah practitioners may be Afro-Guyanese or Indo-Guyanese, and members of all the ethnic groups consult them for help with problems concerning health, work, domestic life, and romance. Some villagers wear charms or use other folk practices to protect themselves from harm. =Indigenous religions= Traditional Amerindian religious beliefs vary, but shamans play a significant role in all of them. The shaman is believed to communicate with the world of spirits in order to detect sorcery and combat evil. The shaman is also a healer and an adviser, the representative of the village to the spiritual world and sometimes its political leader as well. Missionary activity to the Amerindians has been intense. As a result, the traditional beliefs and practices of all the Amerindian groups have been modified; some have even disappeared. =House of Israel= The House of Israel was established by an American fugitive, David Hill, also known as Rabbi Edward Washington, who arrived in Guyana in 1972. In the 1970s, the group claimed a membership of 8,000. The House of Israel had a daily radio program in which it preached that Africans were the original Hebrews. Opponents of the government claimed that the House of Israel constituted a private army for Guyana's ruling party, the People's National Congress (PNC). During an anti-government demonstration, a House of Israel member murdered a Roman Catholic priest because he was on the staff of a religious opposition newspaper, the Catholic Standard. The House of Israel also engaged in strikebreaking activities and disruptions of public meetings. Critics of the government alleged that House of Israel members acted with impunity during the government of Linden Forbes Burnham. However, under Hugh Desmond Hoyte, Burnham's successor, Rabbi Washington and key associates were arrested on a long-standing manslaughter charge and imprisoned. =Cults= Entrance to Jonestown, a settlement founded by the Peoples Temple cult in 1974 Guyana acquired international notoriety in November 1978 following a mass murder-suicide at Jonestown, the commune of the People's Temple of Christ, led by the Reverend Jim Jones, of Oakland, California. Allegations of atrocities by commune leaders and charges that the commune was holding people against their will led United States Congressman Leo Ryan to go to Jonestown to investigate. Fearing the exposure from Ryan's report, Jones had the congressman murdered. He then coerced and cajoled over 900 members of the commune to commit murder and suicide. Regional religious demographics As with most countries, religious composition varies somewhat from region to region. The regions mentioned vary greatly from each other in population. The most populated region, region 4, has the highest number of followers of almost any given major religion. Christianity remains the dominant religion of all races, influencing the cultural and legal sections of the country. Anglican affiliation is most prominent in region 7 (Cuyuni- Mazaruni) at 17.5% and region 9 (Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo) at 14.9%. It makes up the smallest percentage of the population in region 1 (Barima-Waini) at only 2.5% of its overall population. On average, people who stated Anglicanism as their religious preference account for 5.2% of Guyana's total population, or just under 39,000 people. Methodists constitute about 1.4% of the Guyanese population (approximately 10,100 people). Region 4, or Demerara- Mahaica has the largest percentage of Methodists at 2.0%; region 1 (Barima- Waini) has the least, only 0.1%. Pentecostals make up more of the Guyanese Christian population than any other denomination, and its numbers vary wildly from region to region. Overall, they make up 22.8% of the nation, or more than 170,000 people. Pentecostalism is least popular in region 9 (Upper Takutu- Upper Essequibo (where Anglicans and Roman Catholics both have a statistically strong presence), where it accounts for only 1.6% of region's total. It is most prevalent in region 1, where it is adhered to by 39.9%. The Roman Catholic Church's numbers also vary greatly. In total, Roman Catholics make up 7% of the population (around 52,900 people). However, regions 1, 8, and 9 are 33.8%, 39.8%, and 50.1% Catholic, respectively. Seventh-day Adventists account for 5% of the total population, or 40,400 people. It is most popular in Cuyuni-Mazaruni, or region 7, where Seventh-day Adventists make up 17.3% of the region. Its lowest is in region number 9, with only 2.1% of Guyanese listing their religious adherence as Seventh-Day Adventism. Jehovah Witnesses make up around 1.3% (or a bit over 9,600 people) of Guyana's total population. The religion is most popular in Barima-Waini (region 1) and Upper Demerara- Berbice (region 10); about 2% of people living in these regions list themselves as followers of the faith. Christians not falling under any of the above denominations make up at least one tenth of the population in every region of Guyana. They are 20.8% (about 155,000) of the population. Christians of other (or no) denomination amass to 31.6% in Potaro-Siparuni (region 8) and 28.15% in Upper Demerara-Berbice (region 10); these two regions have the highest proportions of Christians of other denominations. Hinduism accounts for the religious preference of 185,000 people (24.8%) in the country. Its highest percentages are in region 3 (Essequibo Islands-West Demerara) and region 6 (East Berbice Corentyne) at 37.7% and 42.1% of the regional population respectively. Islamic people total 50,600 in Guyana, making up 6.8% of the national population. Essequibo Islands-West Demerara (region number 3) has the highest percentage of Muslims, 11.8%. Barima-Waini (region 1) contains the lowest Islamic percentage at 0.3% of its regional population. Rastafari is adhered to by 0.5% (around 3,500) of Guyanese people. 1.3% of people living in the 10th region of Guyana (Upper Demerara-Berbice) are Rastas, a higher percent than any other region. The lowest percent of Rastafarians in any region is 0.1% in region number 2 (Pomeroon-Supenaam). Religion and politics Through much of Guyana's history, the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches helped maintain the social and political status quo. The Roman Catholic Church and its newspaper, the Catholic Standard, were vocal opponents of the ideology of the People's Progressive Party (PPP) in the 1950s and became closely associated with the conservative United Force. However, in the late 1960s the Roman Catholic Church changed its stance toward social and political issues, and the Catholic Standard became more critical of the government. Subsequently, the government forced a number of foreign Roman Catholic priests to leave the country. By the mid-1970s, the Anglicans and other Protestant denominations had joined in the criticisms of government abuse. The Anglican and Roman Catholic churches also worked together, unsuccessfully, to oppose the government's assumption of control of church schools in 1976. The Guyana Council of Churches was the umbrella organization for sixteen major Christian denominations. Historically, it had been dominated by the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches. The Guyana Council of Churches became an increasingly vocal critic of the government in the 1970s and 1980s, focusing international attention on its shortcomings. The conflict between the government and the Guyana Council of Churches came to a head in 1985, when members of the PNC-influenced House of Israel physically prevented the council from holding its annual meeting. Later that year, police searched the homes of the major Christian church leaders. The PNC maintained the support of a number of smaller Christian denominations, however. In contrast to the most prominent Christian clergy, who maintained connections with international denominations, Hindu and Muslim leaders depended on strictly local support. For them, resistance to political pressure was more difficult. In the 1970s, the PNC succeeded in splitting many of the important Hindu and Muslim organizations into pro-PNC and pro-PPP factions. Freedom of religion The Constitution of Guyana provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respects this right in practice. The U.S. government could locate no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice during 2007, and prominent societal leaders took positive steps to promote religious freedom. In September 2009, forty mainly U.S. citizen missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were detained briefly. Subsequently the 100+ missionaries were ordered to leave the country within a month. In addition to its missionary work, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints owns approximately $2 million in property in Guyana, and cultivate farms in the country. Missionaries have worked in the country for more than 20 years.

Investigations The Committee for Plundered Ministers met in London, but it delegated much of its work to its sub-committees of which there was one for each county. It was initially envisaged that the committee would help ministers who were evicted from their livings by Royalists for supporting the Parliamentary cause (hence the name).Foster, xiii However, as Parliament gained the upper hand in the war, so the work of the committees became less to do with supporting clerics who supported their cause and more to do with suppressing those who supported the monarchy. The committee would hear evidence, often from local parishioners, of the errors in doctrine of the parish priest. If the allegations were proved, the rector was replaced and his property forcibly sequestered, so that he could only recover it by buying it back. Local parishioners sometimes used the committee's activities as an opportunity to get rid of clergy they did not like. The committee also acted as trustee, allocating money collected from rent of rectory lands to support priests in their roles throughout Britain. These sequestrated clergy were described as \\"scandalous\\", which meant that either they supported the Royalist cause, or their theological attitudes were high Anglican, or both. Often the two went hand in hand because, in a religious age, some of the political differences about how the country should be governed were over the laws on how church affairs should be organised and the details of how services should be conducted. An example of the worst sort of \\"scandalous\\" behaviour (from the point of view of Parliament and its supporters) was Griffith Williams, who at the start of the Civil War was Bishop of Ossory. He remained a committed Royalist throughout the war, writing pamphlets and preaching against Parliament. During the Interregnum he lived in poverty because of the sequestration that was imposed on his property. Although during this period powerful friends found him livings, he could not take them because he would not take an oath of allegiance to Parliament. He was finally restored to his bishopric after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660.

It was released in 1987, after John Norum left the band, following the release of The Final Countdown album and the tour that followed. The album features two cover songs, \\"Back on the Streets\\", written by former Kiss guitarist Vinnie Vincent with country artist Richard Kinky Friedman and originally recorded by the band 3-Speed for a 1984 movie soundtrack, and \\"Wild One\\" by Thin Lizzy. The album's producer Thomas Witt is/was Norum's stepfather, a former drummer for Eddie Meduza and a high- ranking manager at CBS/Sony in Sweden at the time. Total Control is dedicated to Tommy Östervik, one of Norum's friends and heroes, who died in a drowning accident the same night as Europe played a concert that later was broadcast on Swedish television. Norum toured Scandinavia in early 1988 with a line-up consisting of himself, Edman, Jacob, keyboardist Mats Olausson (Yngwie Malmsteen, Talisman) and ex-Trash drummer Hempo Hildén. After the tour a collaboration with Phenomena and Deep Purple singer/bassist Glenn Hughes was announced and Edman and Jacob were let go. The collaboration was short lived and resulted only in a short televised live performance from Gothenburg. Edman and Jacob replaced Hughes for the booked summer tour but were let go once again when Norum and Hildén were recruited by Don Dokken for his solo album and tour.

Antonio Francesco Gori, on his titlepages Franciscus Gorius (9 December 1691 – 20 January 1757), was a Florentine antiquarian, a priest in minor orders, provost of the Baptistery of San Giovanni from 1746,Date from Dictionary of Art Historians ); in this capacity he transcribed the description of the Baptistery by senator Carlo Strozzi (1587–1670), which is otherwise lost.

In 1735 he was a founding member of a circle of antiquaries and connoisseurs in Florence called the Società Colombaria,the organising meeting, 15 May 1735, convened in the \\"Colombaria\\" tower in the founding member Giovanni Girolamo de' Pazzi's palazzo in Borgo degli Albizi. the predecessor of the Accademia Toscana di Scienze e Lettere la Colombaria,Scholarly societies: Accademia Toscana di Scienze e Lettere la Colombaria to foster \\"not only Tuscan Poetry and Eloquence, or one faculty only; but almost all the most distinguished and useful parts of human knowledge: in a word, it is what the Greeks called Encyclopedia\\".Gori, \\"Prefazione,\\" Memorie di varia erudizione della Società Colombaria Fiorentina, Florence, 1747, vol. I, pp. XI-XII, quoted by the IMSS Multimedia Catalog. Gori's early career As a young man Gori studied with Anton Maria Salvini (1653–1729) and was inspired by the Etruscan studies of Filippo Buonarroti (1661–1733).Date from Dictionary of Art Historians He made a dramatic discovery in 1726 on the Via Appia near Rome. It was the columbarium of the household, both free and slaves, of Livia, the consort of Emperor Augustus. The following year he published it, with notes by Salvini, in a handsome folio with 21 engraved plates, under the title Monumentum sive columbarium libertorum et servorum Liviae Augustae et Caesarum, Romae detectum in Via Appia, anno MDCCXXVI (Florence, 1727).(Quaritch) Gori, Monumentum sive columbarium... ; the title in full, Monumentum Sive Columbarium Libertorum et Servorum Liviae Augustae et Caesarum Romae detectum in Via Appia. Anno MDCCXXVI... Descriptum, & XX. Aere incisis Tabulis illustratum Adjectis Notis Clariss. V. Antonii Mariae Salvinii. Each of the book's plates was dedicated to an influential patron of the arts or a well-known connoisseur of antiquities, among them the English merchant banker Joseph Smith of Venice, who, though not yet English consul, was already a promising collector and patron, and Sir Thomas Dereham (died 1738),Noted by Quaritch. an English bachelor who had been educated at the court of Cosimo III de' Medici and continued to reside in the city.Burke, A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Extinct and Dormant Baronetcies, s.v. \\"Dereham, of West Dereham\\". Another publication of 1727 was Gori's repertory of classical inscriptions, Inscriptiones graecae et latinae. No doubt on the strength of his publication the previous year, Gori was commissioned by the Salviati to produce descriptive text for a vanity publication that described the chapel of Saint Antonino, bishop of Florence, in the church of San Marco, a vehicle of Salviati patronage and of their public figura; the preface was signed by Alamanno Salviati.Descrizione della capella di S. Antonino Vescovo di Firenze ...dedicata al medesimo santo dalla famiglia de Salviati patrizii fiorentini..., Florence, 1728 (on-line description of the volume). Museum Florentinum The major undertaking that gave Gori a European reputation was under way from the early 1730s, when Gori started work on the Museum Florentinum, a comprehensive visual record of the Medici and other collections in Florence of antiquities of all kinds; the project eventually extended to twelve folio volumes, published 1731–1766.This survey of Museum Florentinum depends on the on-line description of the volumes at ILAB LILA. Gori employed artists like Giovanni Domenico Campiglia,A drawing by Campiglia for Musaeum Florentinum at the National Gallery of Scotland, illustrated on-line. Giovanni Domenico Ferretti and Antonio Pazzi to draw copies of famous works of which he oversaw the engraving and publication. The first volume, in two parts, Gemmae antiquae ex Thesauro Mediceo et privatorum dactyliothecis florentiae ... Imagines virorum illustrium et deorum. (1731–32) covered antique cameos and portraits, with 200 plates. The second volume, Statuae antiquae deorum et virorum illustrium (1734) was on Roman statues and monuments, with 100 plates; it was dedicated to Gian Gastone de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, last of the Medici Grand Dukes, whose collection dominated the publication. The third volume, in three parts, Antiqua numismata aurea et argentea praestantiora et aerea maximi moduli (1740 [I and II] and 1742 [III], with 121 plates. A fourth volume, Serie di ritratti degli eccellenti pittori simply consists of fifty portraits of well-known artists, architects, sculptors and engravers. The Museum Florentinum described for the first time many of the sculptures and antiquities in the Medici collections. Other publications Illustration of Acta Eruditorum, 1739 with Etruscan alphabet and review of Museum Etruscum Gori also published ancient inscriptions found in Etruria, in a series of volumes, his Museum Etruscum, in three volumes published between 1736 and 1743. These are among the incunabula of Etruscan studies, and incurred the jealous criticism of his rival in incipient Etruscology, Francesco Scipione Maffei (1675–1755); the two engaged in running skirmishes in print. He edited Giovanni Battista Doni's collected transcriptions of ancient inscriptions (1731), and issued a publication on Late Antique and Byzantine ivory diptychs.John Edwin Sandys, A History of Classical Scholarship 1908:380f. His Museum cortonense (Rome 1750) in co-operation with Rodolfo Venuti of Cortona and Francesco Valesi of Rome, described antiquities in Cortona, both in the academy and in noblemen's collections. Gori catalogued the collection of antique carved gemsModern scholarship has identified the larger part of the \\"antique\\" carved hardstones famous in the 17th and 18th centuries as Early Modern pastiches. assembled by the Venetian art dealer and connoisseur Antonio Maria Zanetti (1698–1767),Gori, Le gemme antiche di Anton-Maria Zanetti (Venice 1750); Zanetti should not be confused with his son, also Anton Maria and also an antiquarian, who preserved record of the fading exterior frescoes of Venetian palaces in Varie pitture a fresco de' principali maestri Veneziani (1760). so it was natural at the end of his career that he compile the catalogue of the engraved and carved gem and cameo collection assembled by Consul Smith in Venice, not only carefully describing the gems, illustrated in 100 engraved plates, but also included a detailed history of gem engraving and a discussion of gem engravers, though he concentrated on the iconography of the subjects represented and did not attempt to ascribe the gems to a period. After purchase of many of the gems for George III, the work was sumptuously printed by J.B. Pasquali in Venice, as Dactyliotheca Smithiana., 1767.A copy from the library of the Marquis of Rockingham and Earl Fitz-William.

It is distinguished from the other main types (barrier reefs and atolls) in that it has either an entirely shallow backreef zone (lagoon) or none at all. If a fringing reef grows directly from the shoreline (see photo, right) the reef flat extends right to the beach and there is no backreef. In other cases (e.g., most of the Bahamas), fringing reefs may grow hundreds of yards from shore and contain extensive backreef areas with numerous seagrass meadows and patch reefs. This type of coral reef is the most common type of reef found in the Caribbean and Red Sea. Darwin believed that fringing reefs are the first kind of reefs to form around a landmass in a long-term reef growth process.Kennedy, D.M. and Woodroffe, C.D. 2002.Fringing reef growth and morphology: a review. Earth-Science Reviews. 57:255-277. Barrier reef Sometimes it is hard to tell the difference between fringing reefs and another type of reef called a barrier reef. One of the ways that these two types of reefs are separated is based on the depth of the lagoon in the back reef. Barrier reefs have at least some deep portions; fringing reefs do not. Another major difference is that barrier reefs tend to be much farther away from shore than fringing reefs. Structure Diagram of a fringing coral reef There are two main components that make up a fringing reef, the reef flat and the reef slope. =Reef flat (back reef) = The reef flat is the shoreward, flat, broadest area of the reef. The reef flat is found in fairly shallow water, and can be uncovered during low tide. This area of the reef is only slightly sloped towards the open ocean.Castro, Peter and Huber, Michael E. 2008. Marine Biology. 7ed. McGraw-Hill, New York Since the reef flat is adjacent or nearly adjacent to land, it sustains the most damage from runoff and sediments. Typically, few of the flat's corals are alive. Seagrasses, seaweeds, and soft corals are often found there. =Reef slope (fore reef)= The reef slope is found at the outer edge of the fringing reef, closest to the open ocean. This area of the reef is often quite steep and descends either to a relatively shallow sand bottom or to depths too great to allow the growth of coral. Coral grows much more abundantly on this slope, both in numbers and in species diversity. This is mostly because runoff and sediments are less concentrated here. Greater wave action disperses pollutants and carries nutrients to this area. In addition a common feature on the fore reef is spur and groove formations which transport sediment downslope in the groove. The upper portion of this slope is called the reef crest. The crest has the best balance between sunlight and waves, so coral grows fastest here. The base of the slope receives the least sunlight and has the least growth out of the whole slope. Location of fringing reefs Fringing reefs are located near shore in the tropics in many areas and are the most common reef type. Coral reefs are found in the tropics in which the water is between .Zubi, Teresa. 2007. Ecology, Coral Reefs. http://www.starfish.ch/reef/reef.html Accessed on March 30, 2008 Many of the Great Barrier Reef's components are actually fringing reefs. Of the close to 3400 individual reefs, 760 are actually fringing reefs.Australian Museum. 2004. geoscience: the Earth, Great Barrier Reef. http://www.amonline.net.au/geoscience/earth/barrier_reef.htm Accessed on March 30, 2008. Near Msambweni, Kenya the reef, which stretches from Msambweni to Malindi in the north, is the world's largest continuous fringing reef. Reef growth This dynamic animation shows the dynamic process of coral atoll formation. Corals (represented in tan and purple) settle and grow around an oceanic island, forming a fringing reef. In favorable conditions, the reef expands, and the interior island subsides. Eventually the island completely subsides beneath the water, leaving a ring of growing coral with an open lagoon in its center. The process of atoll formation may take as long as 30,000,000 years. Island with fringing reef in the Maldives A coral atoll in the Maldives Keep-up: These reefs grow at the same rate that sea level rises. Catch-up: These reefs initially grow more slowly than sea level rises, but eventually catch up when the rise in sea level slows or stops. Give-up: These reefs are not able to grow fast enough and are \\"drowned out\\". Reef development The most important determinant of reef growth is available space as determined by sea level changes. Sea level changes are mostly due to glaciation or plate tectonics. There are six different major ways in which fringing reefs grow and develop. * Reefs can develop vertically as far as the space below the surface allows. The reef generally grows upward from a starting point towards the surface. Once the reef crest reaches sea level the reef may begin growing seaward. Growth begins after flooding, mostly from parts of the reef that have died. Because the reef grows upward, the oldest sediments are found lower in the reef. The reef flat's age indicates when the reef reached sea level. Catch-up reefs have younger surfaces than keep-up reefs of this type. * Reefs can expand seaward from the shore. This requires a fairly constant sea level. If the sea level drops, the reef flat in more seaward areas slopes downward. * Reefs can grow atop muddy sediments which can predate the reef or accrete along with the reef's growth. These reefs also grow seaward from the shore. Older sediments are closest to shore and are not buried. Coral, seagrass and algae filter sediment before it is placed on the reef crest. * Reefs can form in a gradual, sporadic manner, with alternate vertical and horizontal growth episodes. In this type of fringing reef formation there are multiple separate reefs that are found parallel to the shore and the original fringing reef. These reefs become a single, large reef when reef sediments fill in the spaces between the different reefs. * Reefs can develop when an offshore reef grows to sea level forming a barrier. When the crest grows faster than the flat, a lagoon forms. The lagoon then fills with inshore sediments. * Offshore reefs can form their barrier using storms to move coral and other debris inwards. The recurring storms continually reshape the seaward side of such reefs. Effect of tectonic activity Tectonic activity can have very detrimental effects. An earthquake on Ranongga Island in the Solomon Islands moved 80% of its fringing reef permanently above sea level. Northern reefs became elevated 1m above the high tide water height, whereas on the south side reefs moved 2 to 3m above the water height.Albert, U., Udy, J., Baines, G. and McDougall, D. 2007. Dramatic tectonic uplift of fringing reefs on Ranongga Is., Solomon Islands. Coral Reefs 26:983. Threats As with other types of reefs, there are many reasons of fringing reef destruction, such as: *Destructive fishing practices: These include cyanide fishing, blast or dynamite fishing, bottom trawling, and muro-ami (banging on the reef with sticks). Bottom-trawling is one of the greatest threats to cold-water coral reefs. *Over-fishing: This affects the ecological balance of coral reef communities, warping the food chain and causing effects far beyond the directly overfished population. *Careless tourism: Careless boating, diving, snorkeling, and fishing happens around the world, with people touching reefs, stirring up sediment, collecting coral, and dropping anchors on reefs. Some tourist resorts and infrastructure have been built directly on top of reefs, and some resorts empty their sewage or other wastes directly into water surrounding coral reefs. *Marine pollution: Urban and industrial waste, sewage, agrochemicals, and oil pollution are poisoning reefs. These toxins are dumped directly into the ocean or carried by river systems from sources upstream. Some pollutants, such as sewage and runoff from farming, increase the level of nitrogen in seawater, causing an overgrowth of algae, which 'smothers' reefs by cutting off their sunlight. *Sedimentation: Erosion caused by construction (both along coasts and inland), mining, logging, and farming is leading to increased sediment in rivers. This ends up in the ocean, where it can 'smother' corals by depriving them of the light needed to survive. The destruction of mangrove forests, which normally trap large amounts of sediment, is exacerbating the problem. *Coral mining: Live coral is removed from reefs for use as bricks, road-fill, or cement for new buildings. Corals are also sold as souvenirs to tourists and to exporters who don't know or don't care about the longer term damage done, and harvested for the live rock trade. *Climate change: Corals cannot survive if the water temperature is too high. Global warming has already led to increased levels of coral bleaching, and this is predicted to increase in frequency and severity in the coming decades. Such bleaching events may be the final nail in the coffin for already stressed coral reefs and reef ecosystems. Species diversity The backreef area has the least species diversity, which increases seaward towards the reef crest. Some of this difference is due to eutrophication from increased nutrients, sediments and toxicity due to domestic and industrial wastes.Tomascik, T. and Sander, F. 1987. Effects of eutrophication on reef- building corals: II. Structure of scleractinian coral communities on fringing reefs, Barbados, West Indies. Marine Biology. 94:53-75 More macrophytes live on the bottom due to the increases in nutrients. They also feel that this increase in nutrients has caused an increase in the number of phytoplankton that are present above the coral reef. The increase in phytoplankton has led to reduced light reaching the coral species and has also led to a greater number of larger invertebrates to be found. The sediments that are present within the environment cause increased turbidity and may smother some organisms. The corals present on the fringing reefs use four processes to get rid of sediments which include polyp distension, tentacular movement, ciliary action and mucus production. The corals that are present then are thus likely those that can get rid of the sediments the best. Bloodling also known as brooding corals have higher growth and reproduction rates than others. In the area of the reef closest to the shore there is generally a lot of fleshy algae which forms on sand and coral rubble. These types of algae include Lyngbia sp. and Oscilatoria sp. Over recent years the dominant species in the reef flat have been affected by environmental changes. On fringing reefs in Barbados, species such as Diploria strigosa, Palythoa mamillosa, and Diadema antillarum are found. The reef crest's most common species is Porites porites, a type of stony coral, although there are also significant areas covered in flesh-like algae.

Career According to the University of West Georgia’s web page, Beard began as the last principal of the Fourth District Agricultural & Mechanical School, later becoming the first president of the same institution after it grew to become the West Georgia College. He later became the College’s Director of Libraries in 1978, and continued as a library director for at least 26 years, according to the Library Journal. From there he served on numerous committees and chairs, including membership of the White House Conference on Libraries and the Information Services Task Force, the latter of which he became national co-chair of in 1991. In a memorial from the Georgia Library Association, he is also noted to have served on many other committees of the American Library Association such as the ALA Advocacy Assembly, the ALA Chapter Relations Committee, multiple ALA Presidential Campaigns, and the ALA’s own Executive Board. Legacy Beard is cited to have been President of the Southeastern Library Association and many of its associated committees.

Also known as GALILEO, it was an online resource of Georgia libraries which connected them all in one virtual library that allowed them to easily obtain and read stored articles, scholarly journals, and books within its database. This saved libraries several million dollars in providing a wide variety of patron-friendly tools and services that would, standing alone, cost much more than some facilities would be able to afford. Through its GIL system, it also connected libraries across the state by providing tools for cataloguing and sharing resources among them, such as magazines, rare books, and encyclopedias.

It is the only game in the Star Wars franchise that was released exclusively in Japan. The game is a side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Luke Skywalker, as he travels to join the Rebellion against the Empire.  Gameplay  Star Wars plays like a side-scrolling platformer with two difficulty settings- the novice mission and the pro mission. Luke uses a lightsaber as his primary weapon and can also use the Force to execute special maneuvers like floating, speeding and stopping time. Energy to activate Force powers can be obtained through diamonds collected after killing an enemy, called \\"Force points\\". At the end of each level, the player must fight one of several apprentices of Darth Vader, who initially look the same as Vader himself, but will change into other creatures when hit for the first time. In two levels, the Death Star and Yavin IV, the player actually does fight the real Darth Vader. When the characters are rescued, they will help Luke by providing hints and other actions that are important to progress through the game. Certain actions at some levels require talking to the characters via an in-game menu. Between planets, players control the Millennium Falcon from the cockpit as they fight TIE fighters that prevent the ship's entrance to the next planet. The final level involves using the X-wing against the Death Star. While the film's climactic sequence occurred inside a long trench, the game's version can be roughly described as a vertically scrolling overhead maze-like stage, complete with dead ends and intersections. At the end, there is the reactor's duct where the proton torpedoes will be shot automatically to destroy the station. If the player fails to get to the end within a limited amount of time, the Death Star will destroy Yavin IV, and the game will be over. The game is particularly difficult, as the player only has three lives and two continues (activated with enough Force points), and Luke dies upon touching an enemy. The Millennium Falcon and the X-Wing can sustain only one hit before being destroyed, which can be prevented by using one of three deflector shield bursts. The game deviates from the source material very frequently, with the aforementioned examples of Darth Vader having identical apprentices that shape-shift, along with going to planets that never happened in the 1977 film, such as going to an ice planet after rescuing Leia from the Death Star. Inspiration The game design is strongly inspired by the Master System game Alex Kidd in Miracle World, admitted by the programmer Yoshihiro Kishimoto.

The harsh project is one of the largest irrigation projects in the Indian state of Maharashtra. It is a multipurpose project. The water is mainly used to irrigate agricultural land in the drought-prone Marathwada region of the state. It also provides water for drinking and industrial usage to nearby towns and villages and to the municipalities and industrial areas of Aurangabad and Jalna districts. The surrounding area of the dam has a garden and a bird sanctuary.  History and significance  A plan to build a dam on Godavari river in the drought-prone Marathwada region was first conceived during rule of state of Hyderabad. The plan was to build a dam in Beed district near Jayakwadi village with storage capacity of 2,147 MCM (million cubic meters). The project came to be known as Jayakwadi project after the name of the village. However, after formation of new state of Maharashtra and comparative analysis on alternative places, it was decided to build a dam 100 km upstream at Paithan. The project was continued to name as Jayakwadi even after it was shifted to a new location. Building dam at higher level made it possible to have longer canals and thus providing irrigation facility to a larger region. The project proposal for this was completed by 1964. The foundation of the dam was laid by the then Prime minister of India Lal Bahadur Shastri on 18 October 1965. The dam was inaugurated on 24 February 1976 by the then Prime minister Indira Gandhi. Dam Jayakwadi is one of the largest earthen dams in Asia. Its height is approx 41.30 m and length of 9.998 km (10 km approx) with total storage capacity 2,909 MCM (million cubic meters) and effective live storage capacity is 2,171 MCM. The total catchment area of dam is 21,750 km2. There are total 27 water gates for the dam. Jayakwadi Dam is also called as Nathsagar Dam. Over its lifetime, it has overflowed 18 times. On 10 August 2006, the highest discharge of 250000 ft3/s was recorded. Nath Sagar Jalashay Nath Sagar Jalashay is the name of the reservoir formed by Jayakwadi Dam. Fed by the Godavari and Pravara rivers the reservoir is about 55 km long and 27 km wide and spans over 350 km2. Total submergence area due to the reservoir is approx 36,000 hectares. Unfortunately siltation has taken a heavy toll on the project. It is estimated that approximately 30% of the dam is filled with silt, reducing its life as well as storage capacity. Survey findings show that from 2003 to 2012, there was a loss of 31% (that is 8.08 thousand million cubic (TMC) feet) in dead storage and 14% (that is 10.73 TMC) in live storage capacity of the dam due to silt.  Purpose  Jayakwadi project is a multipurpose project. The main purpose was to irrigate land for agriculture in the drought prone Marathwada region of Maharashtra state. Other important purpose was to provide water for drinking and industrial usage to nearby towns and villages and to the municipalities and industrial areas of Aurangabad and Jalna. 80% of water of dam is allocated for irrigation, 5-7% for drinking water and the rest for industrial purposes. The average daily discharge of the dam is around 1.36 MCM, of which 0.05 MCM of water is supplied to the MIDC area, 0.15 MCM is distributed to fulfill the needs of Aurangabad, while the remaining amount is lost in evaporation. =Irrigation= The Jayakwadi project is one of the largest irrigation projects in Maharashtra Of India . Through its canal system, the dam irrigates cultivable area of 237,452 hectares in the districts of Aurangabad, Jalna, Beed, Ahmednagar and Parbhani. The length of left bank canal is 208 km, the length of right bank canal is 132 km, commanding a total area is 183,858 hectares. The gross irrigated area by 96,000 hectares under right bank canal was further enlarged by constructing Majalgaon Dam which acts as a balancing reservoir in addition to harness the Sindphana tributary of the Godavari river. =Electricity generation= A hydroelectric power plant of 12 MW capacity is installed on the right bank of the river. The water used for power generation is pumped back to the main reservoir from the tail pond using reversible hydro turbine. During the drought year 2015, the inflows into the reservoir were very meagre due to failure of rains in the catchment area. However nearly 18 tmcft dead storage water available in the reservoir could not be used for the dire needs. With minor external modifications to the exiting reversible hydro turbine unit, most of the dead storage water can be put to use during the drought years by using the hydro power plant for pumping water into the nearby right canal. Water would be released downstream into the tail pond over the spillway (if needed by siphon pipes). Nearly five km long contour canal at MDDL of the right canal in the reservoir area is constructed to connect the power house area with the right canal intake point. The pen stock of the hydro power unit is extended (less than 100 m long) to connect to the contour canal. The hydro power unit is operated in pumping mode to pump water from the tail pond to the right canal when the reservoir level is below the canal's minimum draw down level (MDDL). The pen stock extension piping is detached when water pumping to the canal is not required to restore its normal power generation when the reservoir level is above the right canal's MDDL When the reservoir level is above the right canal MDDL level, the contour canal located in the reservoir area gets submerged without suffering any damage as it is not obstructing the flood flow to the dam spillway. =Industrial use= Around 0.05 MCM water is supplied daily from dam to various industries located in Aurangabad and Jalna MIDC areas. The dam is also a primary source of water to the Parli Thermal Power Station. Flora and fauna Aquatic vegetation has species of Chara, Spirogyra, Hydrilla, Potamogeton and Vallisneria. Surrounding areas grow Argemone mexicana and Ipomoea carnea. Around 37 species of flora have been reported in the vicinity of reservoir. Seasonal farming (gal pera) is carried out on the exposed land when the waterline recedes. Dnyaneshwar Udyan Dnyaneshwar Udyan is one of the largest gardens in Maharashtra resembling the Brindavan Gardens of Mysore. It is spread over 125 hectares and is situated on the banks of Nathsagar Lake formed due to Jayakwadi Dam. It is located near the town of Paithan which is 50 km south of Aurangabad. Jayakwadi Bird Sanctuary Migratory birds at Jayakwadi The Nath Sagar reservoir creates 30 island of various sizes in the shallow waters, with trees for roosting, this provides an ideal shelter for migratory birds. Close to the dam a bird sanctuary has been created which is home for many species of resident and migrant birds. Almost 200 species of birds can be found in this region, which includes more than 70 species of migratory birds. Out of these, 45 chief species are of international migration. Notable amongst migratory birds are cranes, flamingos, pintails, wigeons, shovellers, brahminy ducks, pochards, teals, godwits, shauces and glossy ibises. Many species are reported in numbers larger than 1% of their bio-geographic population thresholds in Jayakwadi bird sanctuary (Wetlands International Norms – 2002). The Jayakwadi bird sanctuary qualifies for the congregatory criteria A4-i, A4-iii and A4-iv. [ A4i (≥1% biogeographic population), A4iii (≥20,000 water birds), A4iv (known to exceed thresholds set for migratory species) ].

The gameplay involves obtaining power ups and slowing down opponents, in order to reach the finish line first. The gameplay is similar to that of the Wipeout series. There are 10 sectors containing 5 tracks each. They are total of 40 race tracks along with 7 usable ships. For every track competed by the player, a new ship is unlocked. Unlike most racing games, the player can steer off course away from the track at the cost of lowered speed. Players step into the shoes of Connor Rhodes, ace pilot of Earth as he competes against aliens around the galaxy. Each has its own personality and ship. The game features pre-rendered cutscenes between each race. Plot 117 million years ago, the Rails, which are narrow tracks thousands of miles long, were constructed by unknown life forms, with their purpose unclear. The Rails are half open, winding tubes with a red power strip along one side that boosts a ship's speed the closer it flies to it. They were transformed into massive race tracks, on which the 43 known civilizations of the galaxy compete for the right to be called \\"the champion\\". The prize at the end of championship is the Star Sphere, assembled from 43 stones found at each track, forming a near-perfect globe, still incomplete, as it has one piece missing. Five centuries ago, a 44th Rail was discovered, orbiting a dying star, but it doesn't contain the missing piece. Even so, the racers must compete at this last Rail, located at Epsilon Indi. The actual championship welcomes the first racer from Earth, Connor Rhodes, as he competes for the Star Sphere. At the end of the game, Rhodes wins the championship and the Star Sphere. It is revealed that he has the last piece of the globe. As he fits it in the sphere's empty space, it glows and exits the ship, departing to an unknown location. Rhodes gives chase, eventually arriving to Earth's asteroid belt as the sphere forms the last hidden rail, made of asteroids. Rhodes races through it to the end, where seems to be a dead end. Both the sphere and the ship collide, leaving no remains as they seemingly explode. The mystery of the Rails is left unrevealed, though some say that Rhodes, before colliding, discovered their secret. It is revealed that Rhodes survived, as he was teleported to another place that could be either a different dimension or a distant part of the universe, just before another ship race starts. Gameplay The player chooses one of the two starter ships (the other three can be obtained as the sectors are completed) to race in 11 sectors with four races each, except for the last one, that only contains one. The player can shoot with various weapons which ammunition can be obtained as one goes racing through the tracks. These shots are used to destroy the drones or to hinder the progress of the other ships. Even though there is a way to shoot and there is the possibility of being shot by other ships, there is no damage meter, nor a way of destroy the ships with pilots or be destroyed. Reception Starwinder received mediocre reviews, with critics generally commenting that the tracks are too short and differ in little more than the background graphics, leading to gameplay which is overly easy and repetitive. While Next Generation and Electronic Gaming Monthly offered some praise for the graphics and the strategy added by the ability to leave the track at the cost of reduced speed, Tom Ham of GameSpot called the graphics mediocre and contended that staying on the track is the best strategy in every situation, making the gameplay essentially restrictive as well as repetitive. Scary Larry of GamePro called Starwinder \\"a mediocre, barely enjoyable race\\", and Next Generation concluded that \\"the control of the ships and play mechanics simply aren't varied or engaging enough to hold one's attention for very long.\\" References External links * Starwinder at IGN * Starwinder at GameSpot * Starwinder at MobyGames Category:1996 video games Category:Futuristic racing games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation (console)-only games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Starwinder"},{"id":"16720288","text":"Charles Dudley \\"Charlie\\" Daly (October 31, 1880 – February 12, 1959). was an American football player and coach, an author, and served in the United States Army during World War I. He played college football as a quarterback at Harvard University and the United States Military Academy and served as the head football coach at the latter from 1913 to 1916 and 1919 to 1922, compiling a career record of 58–13–3. Daly was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1951. Education Daly attended Boston Latin School. and Harvard University, where he was a member of ΑΔΦ,. the Fly Club,. the Hasty Pudding Club. and editor of The Harvard Crimson for two years. An all-around athlete, Daly was a member of the Harvard varsity football team from 1898 to 1900. He led the team's offense during its undefeated 1898 and 1899 seasons and was team captain in 1900. He was a Consensus All-American in 1898, 1899, and 1900. He also competed on Harvard's Track and field, where he won the high jump at the 1898 and 1899 Harvard-Yale meets and the broad jump at an 1899 competition against University of Cambridge and Oxford in London. Daly graduated from Harvard in 1901 with an Artium Baccalaureus.. On the eve of the 1900 Harvard-Yale football game, Daly received word that he had been appointed to the United States Military Academy. In 1901, he led Army to an 11 to 5 victory over Navy. In that game he had a 95-yard kickoff return and kicked a field goal and converted one extra point. That same season he kicked a 50-yard field goal in a game against Yale. Army's only loss in 1901 came against Daly old team, Harvard, when Daly's successor as team captain, Robert Kernan, stiff-armed him en route to the game-winning touchdown. Daly was once again named to the All-American team in 1901. Daly graduated from West Point in 1905 and received the rank of 2nd Lieutenant. Daly was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951. Boston fire commissioner In 1906, Daly resigned from the Army and returned to Boston, where he entered the bond brokerage business and served as an assistant football coach at Harvard. On August 18, 1910, Boston Mayor John F. Fitzgerald appointed Daly to the position of Fire Commissioner. He took office on September 16, 1910 following confirmation from the civil service commission. He was removed from office by Fitzgerald on January 26, 1912. According to Fitzgerald, Daly was dismissed because he had neglected to sign paperwork approving a pension for John J. Carney, a former member of the department, before the man died. Daly contended that the reason for his removal was political, stating that \\"there has never existed any honest or proper reason for the Mayor's desire to remove me from office...He wished promotions, transfers, appointments and contracts awarded in a manner which did not seem to be in the best interests of the city... The grossest administration would have been very acceptable provided the political machine could have milked the department for the countless favors it lives on\\". Daly opposed special pensions \\"as a matter of principle\\" and contended that Carney, who had not yet completed his probationary period, had not died as a result of anything related to his duties with the fire department (Carney contended that his illness was caused by getting soaked while putting out a fire and not being able to change into dry clothes for several hours). Following his dismissal, Daly worked in the motor truck business. Personal life On November 29, 1912 he married Beatrice Jordan. The couple would have five children. Their three sons graduated from West Point and their two daughters married West Point graduates. Military career In 1912, Daly sought reinstatement into the Army through action of the United States Congress. Daly's reinstatement was strongly opposed by Representative James Michael Curley, who attacked Daly for having failed in his prior duties (specifically the matter of John J. Carney) and stated that Daly was only able to get a bill introduced through his Harvard connections. He was also opposed by Representative James Robert Mann, who disagreed with the practice of restoring officers to the Army and also criticized Daly's lack of success following his departure from the Army. Representatives Andrew J. Peters, Augustus P. Gardner Samuel W. McCall spoke on Daly's behalf, as did Representative William F. Murray, who had lost his chance for a West Point appointment to Daly. Army Chief of Staff Leonard Wood also supported Daly's reinstatement. The bill passed shortly before the 62nd United States Congress died and was signed by President William Howard Taft on March 4, 1913. On April 1, 1913, the War Department ordered Daly to report to Fort Myer for temporary assignment. He then jointed the 5th Field Artillery Regiment at Fort Sill. Following his reinstatement, Daly served in a number of stations of the United States Army Field Artillery Corps, including Fort Sam Houston, Schofield Barracks, and West Point, where he served as head football coach. Upon the United States' entry into World War I, Daly was attached to 338th Field Artillery, 88th Division at Camp Dodge. He was promoted to temporary major on August 5, 1917 and attached to 29th Field Artillery. He was later detailed to School of Fire at Fort Sill as instructor. On June 25, 1918 he was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel. (, archived by WebCite at ) On October 24, 1918 he was promoted temporary colonel and placed in command of the 29th Field Artillery. After the War ended, he was appointed to the War Department General Staff, where he oversaw the transport and troop movements during demobilization. He was demoted to Regular Army grade captain Field Artillery on August 20, 1919 and detailed to the U.S. Military Academy as instructor. He promoted to major in 1920 and by 1921 was a Captain. From 1924 to 1925, Daly commanded the 76th Field Artillery Regiment at the Presidio of Monterey. In 1925 he returned to Harvard as an instructor at the school's department of military sciences and assistant football coach. In October 1926 he was transferred to Honolulu. From 1928 to 1934 he was an Assistant Professor of Military Science and Tactics at West Point. Daly spent his final years with the Army stationed in Washington D.C. at the Army War College and the War Department. On February 8, 1932, Daly suffered a heart attack at his desk at the United States Department of War in Washington. He retired from the Army on July 31, 1933 due to disability caused by heart disease. He retired with the rank of Colonel. Coaching Daly was the head football coach at West Point from 1913 to 1916 and again from 1919 to 1922. Known as the \\"Godfather of West Point Football\\", he was coach to Dwight Eisenhower, Omar Bradley, Joseph Stilwell, Matthew Ridgway, James Van Fleet, George S. Patton and other American military luminaries of the 20th century.. In 1921 he founded the American Football Coaches Association. He retired from coaching in 1925 after serving one season as an assistant coach at Harvard while on military assignment there. =Head coaching record= Death Daly field marker at West Point Following his retirement, Daly moved to Pacific Grove, California. He died on February 12, 1959 at his home. He was survived by his wife and five children. His memorial service was held at the Post Chapel at the Presidio of Monterey and he was interred at the West Point Cemetery. In 1963, the football practice field at West Point was named in Daly's honor.

It came to epitomise the culture of heroic imperialism in late Victorian Britain and in British popular culture up to the mid-twentieth century.Tate Britain, Millais, 2007, p. 158 The painting depicts the young, wide-eyed Walter Raleigh and his brother sitting on the beach by the Devonshire coast. He is listening to a story of life on the seas, told by an experienced sailor who points out to the sea.Tate Gallery, The Boyhood of Raleigh Origins The painting was influenced by an essay written by James Anthony Froude on England's Forgotten Worthies, which described the lives of Elizabethan seafarers. It was also probably influenced by a contemporaneous biography of Raleigh, which imagined his experiences listening to old sailors as a boy.

In 1928 David Low published a cartoonhttp://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2018/jeffrey- archer-l18417/lot.66.html showing the Earl of Birkenhead (Secretary of State for India), Stanley Baldwin (Prime Minister) and Winston Churchill (Chancellor of the Exchequer) listening to \\"Tales of the Dominions\\" from a diminutive sailor (Leo Amery, Colonial Secretary – who was a very short man). In 1993 the Sunday Telegraph ran \\"The Boyhood of Hurd and Major\\". The then Prime Minister John Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who had recently pushed the Maastricht Treaty through Parliament against the wishes of many Conservatives, were shown as small boys in Elizabethan costume, listening as an old sailor (Sir Edward Heath) gestured towards the coast labelled \\"Europe\\" visible on the other side of the water. Former Prime Minister Heath – whose hobby had been yachting – had taken Britain into the EEC (as it was then called) during his premiership, and had grown up in Kent where the coast of France is visible on a clear day. At the time Heath was Father of the House of Commons and enjoying something of an Indian Summer after the ousting of his political nemesis, the eurosceptic Margaret Thatcher, as Prime Minister in 1990. In 1999 the Daily Telegraph published a Garland cartoon, showing the then Conservative leader William Hague as a small boy (this was common in satire at the time, as Hague had first attained national fame as a teenager in the 1970s), while two old sailors – former Foreign Secretary David Owen and former Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey – gestured inland and away from a ship labelled \\"Euro\\". The two elder statesmen described themselves as pro-European but opposed to British membership of the Single Currency. =Postcolonialism= The picture has also appeared in recent explorations of postcolonialism, most notably Salman Rushdie's novel Midnight's Children, in which the narrator Saleem Sinai partly misremembers and transforms the meaning of the painting, a copy of which hung on his bedroom wall when he was a child.Neil Ten Kortenaar, \\"Postcolonial Ekphrasis: Salman Rushdie Gives the Finger Back to the Empire\\", Contemporary Literature, Vol. 38, No. 2 (Summer, 1997), pp. 232-259. =Record covers= Elements of the picture appear on the cover of the Talk Talk album It's My Life. The painting is also reproduced in part on the cover of the 1982 single \\"Almost With You/Life Speeds Up\\" by The Church.

Through carbon-14 dating, it has been determined that there is very little evidence of human life in the Danger Cave area c. 11,000 BP [9000 BC], but there is much evidence of human life by 9,000 BP [8000 BC]. Danger cave was first investigated in the 1930s by Elmer Smith, and excavated in the 1950s under the supervision of Jesse D. Jennings, professor at the University of Utah. Jennings' work at the site was considered ground-breaking due to his exacting standards in excavation and data analysis. Though Jenning's findings eventually gained widespread acceptance, his publications garnered both criticism and support at first. Relating the archaeological evidence from Danger Cave to an ethnographic model, Jennings framed a view of the little- known Great Basin Desert culture which was unknown at the time. The extremely dry cave had created an ideal storage condition that preserved a variety of artifacts from beetle wings to textiles and human paleofeces. They also found leather scraps, pieces of string, nets of twine, coarse fabric, basket fragments, and bone and wood tools such as knives, weapons, and millstones. In total, excavations have produced over 2,500 chipped-stone artifacts and over 1,000 grinding stones. The excavation also yielded identifiable fragments of 68 plant species that still grow today within ten miles of the cave as well as the bones of many species of animals. The data collected from the cave suggested that the Desert Culture had a sparse population, with small social units numbering no more than 25 to 30 people. The focus on survival prevented the inhabitants from building permanent structures, developing complicated rituals, or amassing extensive personal property. The Desert Culture persisted for thousands of years despite the hardships they faced, and eventually became the basis for other early Utah cultures such as the Fremont. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961. and References External links http://metcalfdangercavetours.com *Danger Cave on About.com *Danger Cave on Utah History To Go Category:National Historic Landmarks in Utah Category:Landforms of Tooele County, Utah Category:Archaeological sites in Utah Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Utah Category:Caves of Utah Category:National Register of Historic Places in Tooele County, Utah ","title":"Danger Cave"},{"id":"16720356","text":"McDade may refer to: People *Alex McDade, Scottish anti-fascist and poet *Aubrey McDade, American marine *Joseph M.

She was built at the Royal Norwegian Navy Shipyard in Horten in 1901, with yard number 85. She was to see close to 40 years service with the Royal Norwegian Navy, taking part in the preparations for war in connection with the dissolution the union with Sweden in 1905, enforcing Norwegian neutrality during the First World War and opposing the German invasion of Norway in 1940. She was lost in battle with Kriegsmarine vessels at Ånuglo in the Hardangerfjord on 18 April 1940. Name Sæl is the pre-1917 Reform Bokmål version of the Norwegian word sel, meaning seal. Characteristics Sæl was reasonably seaworthy in calm seas, with little engine noise and no bow water. The intent behind her design was to enable her to attack enemy shipping in both open seas and close to shore with the least possible chance of being spotted before launching torpedoes at her targets.Hegland & Lilleheim 1998: 21 The 37 mm gun armament was placed one on each side of the ship, making it impossible for both her QF guns to fire at one target simultaneously.Hegland & Lilleheim 1998: 57 Early career =Tension with Sweden= Having been launched as the penultimate of the ten 1. class torpedo boats built for the Royal Norwegian Navy, HNoMS Sæl was amongst the front-line RNoN units mobilised in connection with the tense political conditions between Norway and Sweden as the Norwegians dissolved the 91-year-old personal union between the two countries. As the two countries appeared on the brink of war in the autumn of 1905, the Royal Norwegian Navy carried out exercises involving almost its entire force. By the time the Karlstad negotiations met with success and Sweden recognised the independence of Norway on 23 October 1905, Sæl and many of the other Norwegian ships were patrolling the Oslofjord in expectation of a Swedish naval attack against the country's capital Oslo and the central military and industrial area of Eastern Norway. =First World War= During the First World War, Norway declared herself a neutral country and took no active part in the war. Sæl served throughout the war years escorting merchant ships in Norwegian waters and guarding the coast against neutrality violations. The Norwegian torpedo boats spent the war spread along the coast with orders to confront and board any warship that approached the coast of Norway, even though they might not necessarily enter Norwegian territorial waters.Hegland & Lilleheim 1998: 37–38 In the run-up to the war Sæl had been part of a large Norwegian naval manoeuvre during the International Yacht Racing Union's fourth annual Europe week sailing regatta, held in Horten 14 to 21 July 1914. Inter-war years Among the missions given the Norwegian torpedo boat force after the First World War was apprehending rum runners during Norway's 1919–1926 prohibition. On one occasion in the autumn of 1924 the customs patrol boat Bjørnen discovered the smuggler ship Paul Weber off Halten in Sør-Trøndelag. Paul Weber was operated by a group of smugglers led by the flamboyant Paul Weber. Bjørnen called for assistance from Sæl to capture the smuggler. Sæl caught up with Paul Weber off the island of Frøya and opened fire, using live rounds, and lighted up the smuggler vessel with her searchlights. After a chase among the skerries, and numerous live warning shots, the Paul Weber surrendered to the torpedo boat.Johansen 1994: 88 Second World War At the outbreak of the Second World War, the close to 39-year-old Sæl and 16 other torpedo boats of three classes were taken out of reserve and mobilised in five divisions. Sæl was part of the 4th Torpedo boat Division in the 2nd Naval District together with HNoMS Storm and HNoMS Brand.Hegland & Lilleheim 1998: 50 The divisions were purely administrative units, with each torpedo boat spread singly on the coast from Oslofjord to Trøndelag. For the 4th Torpedo boat Division, deployed to the south western Vestlandet region, the war initially entailed coastal guard duties and hailing Norwegian merchant ships as they left Norwegian waters, handing over the latest news reports and wishing them a safe voyage. =Norwegian Campaign= Attempted defence of Bergen In the morning of 8 April 1940, on the eve of the German invasion of Norway, Sæl was docked at the Marineholmen naval base in Bergen between patrol missions.Hegland & Lilleheim 1998: 52 By 02:30 on 9 April she had finished coaling,Hegland & Lilleheim 1998: 53 having been ordered to make war preparations the previous day, and moved south towards her blocking position in the Lerøy area in the approaches to Bergen. Due to a lack of information as the position of the intruding German forces she sailed on a collision course with the German Kampfgruppe 3. When the German ships were spotted by Sæl they were at such close range that the Norwegians had to make evasive manoeuvres to avoid a collision and were unable to launch a torpedo. As the Kriegsmarine ships passed her at only 10–15 metres distance, Sæl turned around and gave chase in the hope of catching up with the Germans and get within range for a torpedo shot. As dawn was soon approaching Sæl's commander, Fenrik (Ensign) L. Gulbrandsen, decided to disengage and temporarily place his ship in cover behind the Bratholmen islet. Hardangerfjord After Bergen was seized by German forces on 9 April, Sæl relocated to the Hardangerfjord to continue fighting the German invasion. She arrived at Uskedal in Kvinnherad on 12 April, and on 17 April helped a prize crew led by Fenrik Schau from the Trygg class torpedo boat HNoMS Stegg escort the captured 6,567 ton iron ore laden German cargo ship Afrika into the port of Odda.Sivertsen 2000: 72 After being greeted with jubilation and singing by the local population at Odda, Sæl was ordered back to Uskedal that same evening. At Uskedal Sæl formed the Hardangerfjord Naval District () together with the minelayer Tyr and five patrol boats.Sande 1995: 32 Battle with German E-boats The next day, 18 April, HNoMS Stegg was despatched to Langenuen in Austevoll to intercept four merchant ships, leaving Sæl alone in the area. Soon afterwards, an alarm went out in Uskedal warning that three German E-boat fast attack craft were entering the Hardangerfjord. In response, district commander Orlogskaptein (Lieutenant Commander) Ulstrup – the former commander of the mine layer Tyr – gave an oral order that Sæl was to avoid contact with the superior enemy force. Ulstrup felt that the poorly armed, slow and not very manoeuvrable Sæl would not stand a chance against the three fast and modern opponents. The fact that Ulstrup's order was given orally led to a fatal misunderstanding. By the time word reached Fenrik Gulbrandsen, he understood the order to mean that he was to attack and destroy the three E-boats. Believing to be obeying orders, Gulbrandsen sailed Sæl into the fjord to confront the German vessels. At 16:00 the crew of the Sæl spotted two of the E-boats moving at great speed southwards from the Lukksund Narrows between Tysnesøy Island and the mainland. At a distance of Sæl opened up with her bow gun and for five minutes exchanged fire with the German ships. One of the E-boats was hit by several 37 mm rounds and left dead in the water and listing to the side. Soon after, one of Sæl's guns was knocked out by a German 20 mm shell, and shortly thereafter the firing lanyard on the other gun snapped. With multiple rounds hitting the Norwegian torpedo boat's bow, the E-boats moved into point blank range, riddling Sæl from bow to stern. As the third E-boat arrived on the scene, three torpedoes were fired at Sæl, the two first going under the hull and the third hitting a small rock right in front of her. The explosion caused by the last torpedo further damaged the bow of the Norwegian ship and caused water to start flooding her. With the 7.92 mm Colt machine gun providing cover fire, Fenrik Gulbrandsen beached his vessel at full speed to save the crew. During that last manoeuvre Sæl hit an underwater rock and was left grounded with her stern sticking out of the water. At 16:25 Gulbrandsen ordered the crew to abandon ship. Although one man had suffered a lung shot and six others had minor grazing wounds, all 21 crew members made it ashore. Sinking Later in the evening of 18 April the crew of the Sæl attempted to moor their vessel to prevent it from slipping under. At high tide Sæl disappeared beneath the waves at Ånuglo, still flying the Norwegian war flag.Hegland & Lilleheim 1998: 58 After the battle, a Norwegian motorboat brought the wounded to the hospital in Rosendal.Sivertsen 2000: 73 The wreck today The wreck of HNoMS Sæl was relocated in 1968 by the Royal Norwegian Navy's Mine Diver CommandHegland & Lilleheim 1998: 56 who found her at depth, intact with ammunition, mines and torpedoes on board. The ammunition was removed, but the mines and torpedoes were blown up on site, resulting in the complete destruction of the torpedo boat's midsection and leaving only the bow and stern still mostly intact, making her a popular dive site.

Early life Leasure was born in 1819 near Pittsburgh in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. He attended Greersburg Academy in nearby Darlington in Beaver County from 1838 to 1840. Afterwards, he spent time in medical school in Pittsburgh. Civil War Leasure held the rank of colonel in the IX Corps through most of the war. His regiment, the 100th Pennsylvania Infantry, was known as the \\"Roundheads\\" because it was recruited from descendants of the followers of Oliver Cromwell.100th Penn.com The regiment first saw action in the command of Brig. Gen. Isaac I. Stevens at the Battle of Secessionville in South Carolina on June 16, 1862. Transferred to the Virginia theater of the war, Leasure participated in the Second Battle of Bull Run, and the Battle of Chantilly. Wounded at Second Bull Run he subsequently missed the Maryland Campaign. Leasure returned for the Battle of Fredericksburg where he took command of the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division in the IX Corps. Moving to the Western Theater with the IX Corps, Leasure continued in brigade command under Maj. Gen. John Parke during the Siege of Vicksburg and Blue Springs. Returning to command of the 100th Pennsylvania he took part in the Siege of Knoxville. Returning to Virginia, Leasure now commanded the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division in the IX Corps at the Battle of the Wilderness and the Battle of Spotsylvania. When division commander Brig. Gen. Thomas G. Stevenson was killed during the fighting at Spotsylvania, Leasure was the ranking subordinate and took command of the division for 3 days until relieved of this capacity by Maj. Gen. Thomas L. Crittenden. Returning to command the 2nd Brigade, Leasure was wounded a few days later and never returned to field command. He was mustered out of the service on August 30, 1864. He received the brevet rank of brigadier general in 1865. Post-war career When the war ended, Leasure returned to Pennsylvania where he practiced medicine in the borough of Darlington. While in Darlington, Leasure became a trustee of Greersburg Academy where he was educated nearly thirty years before. He later served in the Pennsylvania state legislature, and afterwards, moved to New Castle, Pennsylvania. Leasure then moved to the city of St. Paul, Minnesota in 1878, where he died eight years later on October 10, 1886. His body was returned to Pennsylvania, and was buried in New Castle. Monument The borough of Darlington erected a monument the year following Leasure's death. The monument was placed across from the Greersburg Academy school building where Leasure spent a considerable amount of time in his life. (Other notable Civil War alumni to go through the academy were the abolitionist John Brown and John W. Geary.)

For example, externalities of economic activity are non-monetary spillover effects upon non-participants. Odors from a rendering plant are negative spillover effects upon its neighbors; the beauty of a homeowner's flower garden is a positive spillover effect upon neighbors. In the same way, the economic benefits of increased trade are the spillover effects anticipated in the formation of multilateral alliances of many of the regional nation states: e.g. SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation), ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations). In an economy in which some markets fail to clear, such failure can influence the demand or supply behavior of affected participants in other markets, causing their effective demand or effective supply to differ from their notional (unconstrained) demand or supply. Another kind of spillover is generated by information. For example, when more information about someone generates more information about people related to her, and that information helps to eliminate asymmetries in information, then the spillover effects are positive (this issue has been found constantly in the economics and finance literature, see for instance the case of local banking markets).

In August 2008, a new lineup appeared going under the name xLIFERUINERx (which had been the Canadian band's name when they first started out). This lineup had an entirely unrelated group of members based out of upstate New York - fans would thus refer to this group as 'Liferuiner US' in a method of distinguishing between the two entities, which for certain periods of time co-existed in tumultuous fashion. This version of the band has since disbanded. In early 2010 the Canadian incarnation of Liferuiner, fronted by original member and vocalist Jonny O'Callaghan, announced a return. Since that time the band has released the Sons of Straight Edge EP, 2013's Future Revisionists under InVogue Records and the \\"NOMADS\\" EP in 2016. History The band was originally created to make a sort of joke against mainstream straight edge bands by writing lyrics about hate and death rather than preaching their lifestyle. They played its first show on July 16 in Waterdown, Ontario, coming on as a guest surprise after a Numbers, Revolt set. The band did not play again until later that fall when Jonny returned from touring with The End. The next show took place at the Rocket with Ion Dissonance. The band recorded a live demo at this show which was to be the first demo released to the public. Liferuiner signed a one-record deal with Tribunal Records for the distribution of No Saints. In June 2007 the band announced a deal with Rise Records, but were suddenly dropped from the label's roster after little more than a month's time. The group pressed onwards and inked a one-record deal with Uprising Records, which culminated in the recording and release of the album Taking Back The Night Life in 2008. O'Callaghan, the sole original member remaining, left the group in mid 2008. In a move initiated by the label, tour manager Greg Moore copyrighted the band name and all the songs so that he could continue managing the outfit regardless of who comprised it. Eventually, he also kicked out the remaining Canadian members and replaced them all with members from the US. The Liferuiner US line-up announced in August 2008 that they had signed a multi-album deal with Uprising Records, and that a new album was to be released in March 2009, although no recorded material ever actually materialized from this group. Liferuiner US employed a 'revolving-door' line-up (bordering on hundreds of past members) earning them a sense of comedic infamy amongst previous fans of the band. The group went through a number of teased break-ups, before quietly ceasing operations for good in 2010. Earlier in the same year, O'Callaghan had announced a reformation of the Canadian version of the band, thus leaving them as the sole (and seen by many as the rightful) lineup of Liferuiner once again and toured across the country playing with bands such as Doom Cannon and Gates. In 2011, Liferuiner embarked upon a completely different approach to their music with more serious lyrics and melodic instrumentation. The band released the \\"Sons of Straight Edge\\" EP in December 2011, which was an attempted rebirth for the band, and their first release since \\"Taking Back The Night Life\\". These stylistic alterations were elaborated on in a series of videos entitled \\"Through the Eyes of,\\" featuring O'Callaghan describing changes in his attitude and his desire to write more meaningful music. He now sings about the things that matter to him such as LGBT rights and Humanitarianism. The new musical direction has been rumored to be influenced by bassist Burton Lavery's arrival in July 2011. In 2013 Liferuiner signed a deal with InVogue Records, and would later release their third full-length Future Revisionists.

He has a B.A. and an M.A. from California State University, Long Beach, and a Ph.D. from the University of New Mexico. He has taught at various institutions of higher education in southern California, primarily at Long Beach City College and at California State University, Long Beach. Early life Clifton Snider was born in Duluth, Minnesota, the second of five sons. His father, Allan G. Snider, was a minister with the Assemblies of God denomination. His mother, Rhoda M. Tout, had traveled as an evangelist with Olga Olsson before her marriage to Allan Snider. Because the father was a minister, the family moved frequently. By the age of twelve, Snider had lived in Minnesota; Joliet, Illinois; Terre Haute, Indiana; and several cities in southern California. Critic and scholar He went to Southern California College (an Assemblies of God institution now called Vanguard University) on music and academic scholarships. After two years, he transferred to California State University, Long Beach, where he finished his B.A., graduating with honors in 1969, and his M.A. (1971). He received his Ph.D. in English Literature in 1974 from the University of New Mexico. Snider's doctoral dissertation is a Jungian analysis of Swinburne's Tristram of Lyonesse, and he has published numerous articles on Victorian literature, as well as twentieth century English and American literatures. These include introductions to Jungian psychology (or Analytical Psychology) and criticism, histories of Merlin in 19th-century British literature, as well as such authors as W. H. Auden, Emily Dickinson, Edward Lear, Carson McCullers, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Oscar Wilde, and Virginia Woolf. A specialist in Wilde, he has taught his own seminars on him at California State University, Long Beach, and published several articles on Wilde using his primary critical approaches of Jungian and Queer Criticism. He also taught the first course ever on Gays and Lesbians in Literature at Cal State Long Beach. His book, The Stuff That Dreams Are Made On: A Jungian Interpretation of Literature, contains a chapter on Wilde. His latest article uses Jungian and Queer Criticism to examine Brokeback Mountain, story and film, and appears in the Jungian journal, Psychological Perspectives, January, 2008. Snider's shorter pieces of criticism have appeared in many periodicals, among them The Advocate, the Long Beach Press-Telegram, and the Los Angeles Times. In the early 1980s he was a contributing editor for the Maelstrom Review. Activism A political/peace activist, Snider has posted poems on the national web site, Poets Against the War, and maintains his own web page, A Poet Against the War, on which he has posted some of his own poetry. The page includes many news items, photos, and links regarding the war in Iraq, not the least of which are statistics of the dead and wounded and information about the slaughter in Iraq of academics and gay people. He has served as an officer in the Long Beach Lambda Democratic Club. In the midst of the presidential election during the fall semester of 2004 at Cal State Long Beach, Snider became involved in a national controversy over academic freedom when two of his students, a young woman and a young man, went on Fox News to complain about Snider's comments the first night of a freshman composition class. Because his emphasis in a class that is supposed to promote critical thinking about controversial issues was on morality and spirituality, Snider used the war in Iraq as an example of immorality. He invited any student who disagreed to say so, and these two did. A number of others in the class agreed with Snider. Fox News, however, and a number of other right-wing commentators, responding to a complaint by the female student on David Horowitz's site, Students for Academic Freedom, concentrated on Snider's argument paper topics and his book list for a book review, both of which were perceived as biased (the student said the list had \\"a dominant theme: Sexual [sic] perversion and anti Bush [sic] rhetoric\\"). The homophobic drumbeat was picked up by other sites, such as Agape Press. The hate mail and death threats were such that for a time Snider received police protection while teaching that class (\\"Attack of the Killer Hipublicans,\\" Whole Life Times). The student became a spokesperson for Horowitz, writing numerous articles for right-wing blogs and other web sites, including Horowitz's online FrontPage Magazine,[FrontPage Magazine and appearing again on national television on Paul Gigot's The Journal Editorial Report on September 23, 2005, which at that time was on PBS. Not allowed to respond to his former student's accusations on the Gigot program or on its web site, Snider, who had felt constrained by his employer to keep silent, finally told his side of the story on Insidehighered.com. His former student was claiming Snider had been unfair to her by giving her a \\"B\\" on a paragraph she wrote on the film Fahrenheit 9/11 when she had been achieving a \\"straight-A record\\" in the class. Snider wrote he had \\"the grade book\\" for the class which proved she was not telling the truth. Neither she nor Horowitz ever contested what Snider said, and indeed neither she nor the male student ever followed university policy regarding complaints against professors. Career as a poet and critical reception All of Snider's books of poetry, fiction, and literary criticism have been critically acclaimed. Cadence Collective has called him \\"one of the most magnificent and prolific poets of our time.\\" His first chapbook, Jesse Comes Back (1976), was followed by the elegiac Bad Smoke Good Body (1980), written for the poet's older brother, Evan, who had disappeared under circumstances indicating foul play in October 1976. The loss of his older brother, who was gay, as is Snider, has run through Snider's work through the years, culminating in the frankly autobiographical novel, Wrestling with Angels: A Tale of Two Brothers (2001). Indeed, Snider uses each of the twelve poems from Bad Smoke as epigraphs for each of the twelve chapters of the novel. Snider's criticism and poetry have been translated into Russian, French, Spanish, and Arabic, and his poetry, fiction, and criticism have been published around the world in countries as diverse as Algeria, Canada, England, France, Ireland, and the United States. Much of his work concerns the foreign places he's visited, and though his home is Long Beach, California, the spiritual core of his poetry is often centered in New Mexico, with its rich mixture of Native, Hispanic, and Anglo cultures. In New Mexico he has held a number of residence grants at the Helene Wurlitzer Foundation, Taos. (Other residence grants he has held have been at Yaddo, Saratoga Springs, New York, and the Karolyi Foundation, Vence, France.) In addition to drawing on his own Christian roots for his work, Snider also draws on a multitude of other religious/spiritual traditions, from Native American to East Indian, African, and Nordic peoples, myths, and legends. Of particular interest are his poems about the paleolithic European caves of Niaux and Pech- Merle. Robert Peters examines Snider's work in a chapter titled \\"Poems for an Autobiography\\" in The Great American Poetry Bake-off (1987). In 1986 at The Works Gallery, Long Beach, California, Out Theater produced as its premier production Edwin: A Performance Art Event, based on Snider's book, Edwin: A Character in Poems (1984), and his one-act play, A Little Get-Together. Although, with the exception of Bad Smoke Good Body, Snider's early books focused on characters he invented, fellow Long Beach poet and critic Gerald Locklin maintains in Western American LiteratureWestern Literature Association that Snider's fifth book of poems, Blood & Bones (1988), \\"completes, with the dropping of the 'Jesse' and 'Edwin' personae, [Snider's] transition from modern to postmodern artist. The confidence he now exhibits renders accessible to artistic use a rich though often painful personal history.\\" Of the same book, Richard Labonte writes in the national gay and lesbian magazine, The Advocate: \\"Southern California poet Clifton Snider explores the unexpected, the near tragic, and the adventurous. In three sections, he writes of a trip through Europe in the '70s, of his sudden hospitalization with a bleeding ulcer, and of his return to travel in Europe in the mid '80s. Poems of the first trip are soaked with the blood oozing into his guts; poems of the second trip reflect good health, a good eye, and maturity. The contrast is appealing; the poems, beguiling.\\" Impervious to Piranhas (1989), the chapbook that followed Blood & Bones, collects poems, early and late, which Snider had not found places for in his earlier collections. The Age of the Mother (1992), the full-length book that Snider published next, was praised by Glenn Bach (\\"In these beautifully spare words, Snider weaves personal mantras of birth, death, and transcendence. He announces the return of the Goddess after centuries of patriarchal dominance,\\" Small Press ReviewLiterary & Alternative Magazines :: NewPages Guide :: Small Press Review ) and Marilyn Johnson (\\"Out of ... profound insight and spiritual wisdom he ... has created an offering, a magnificent poetic vision, a prayer-book for the coming New Age,\\" Pearl). His collection of poems, The Alchemy of Opposites (2000), has received the greatest praise of Snider's fairly lengthy career. Eva von Kesselhausen, for example, writes in the Small Press Review: \\"Clifton Snider has been writing and publishing for over 25 years to establish himself as one of American's best . . . contemporary poets. The Alchemy of Opposites . . . stands as his most outstanding book to date . . . [with] poignant poetry which is highly crafted and easy to read.\\" And in the International Gay and Lesbian Review, Arnold T. Schwab declares, \\"The Alchemy of Opposites is Clifton Snider's . . . best work in verse, his most personal and moving\\"; Schwab also admires \\"Snider's emotional directness and the admirable accessibility of his imagery. . . . The Alchemy of Opposites indeed contains outcroppings of pure gold.\\" Two poems from this collection, \\"Le Mont Saint- Michel\\" and \\"Honey from Heaven,\\" won \\"In the Spotlight\\" awards from the online magazine, The Poetry Page, in 1999. Snider published his collection of poems, Aspens in the Wind, in 2009. His much-anticipated career retrospective, covering his 40 years of publishing history, Moonman: New and Selected Poems, came out from World Parade Books in the spring of 2012. In the national online journal, Lambda Literary, Tony Leuzzi writes, \\"Moonman traces Snider's fluid movement from one idiom to another: restrained poems in traditional forms; intellectual utterances that demonstrate his awareness of Western and Eastern philosophical systems; chatty, casual poems that respond to aspects of popular culture; and, most impressively, concise and memorable imagist verse. . . . [In Edwin: A Character in Poems] the persona functions as an effective objective correlative whose dual obsessions with thought and body echo a whole generation of gay men. . . . [Other poems] are lit with a delirious, visionary glow.\\" Snider's new collection of poems, The Beatle Bump, is a creative, often irreverent take on the greatest rock band of all time, with a variety of poetic forms and styles, including ekphrastic poems on the infamous \\"Butcher Sleeve\\" and John Lennon's erotic lithographs. There are song lyrics, a sonnet, and nonsense verse inspired by Lennon's own books. Snider draws on his background in Jungian and Queer criticism to create a unique and refreshing book of poetry and prose (there are two fan letters) about the Beatles. On July 7, 2018, Snider was awarded the inaugural Lorde-Whitman Award for \\"outstanding achievement in the arts and service to the LGBTQ community\\" from OUT LOUD: A Cultural Evolution, Long Beach, California. Novels In 2000-2001 Snider published in rapid succession three novels he had written in the 1980s: Loud Whisper, Bare Roots, and Wrestling with Angels: A Tale of Two Brothers. All were well received by the critics in journals such as the International Gay and Lesbian Review,International Gay & Lesbian Review Sexuality and Culture: An Interdisciplinary Quarterly,British Library Direct: Order Details and Chiron Review. The latter two novels are autobiographical stories about the coming of age and coming out of sensitive young men with deep Christian fundamentalist roots. Loud Whisper chronicles the frontman for an 80's rock band who, drunk and drugged out, falls from stage during a concert and becomes paralyzed. As always, Snider is concerned with spiritual decline and revitalization. Through the eyes of the frontman, Adam, his band members, his male and female lovers, and a journalist doing a story on him, Adam's spiritual and physical struggles unfold. A long-time lecturer at Cal State Long Beach, Snider retired in 2009. His first historical novel, The Plymouth Papers, was published by Spout Hill Press in February, 2014. The short novel examines the relationships between the 17th-century English settlers of Plymouth Colony and the native peoples they encountered, with a frame character from the 19th century who discovers the papers. Snider continues to write poetry, fiction, and criticism. His full curriculum vitae is available on his own university web site.

It was the band's first album not to feature bassist Jennifer Condos, and showed a major departure from their former style. Instead, they now incorporated the use of synthesizer moog pedals, giving the music a much stronger pop-rock sound. In addition, they recruited the assistance of several female backing vocalists on most songs, instead of relying on the other band members to back up Tito Larriva's vocals. This musical element is something the band also featured on their next album, 2002's Andalucia, which featured bassist Io Perry singing backing vocals on almost every song. The rest of the new elements featured on Little Bitch were mostly abandoned on Andalucia, which returned a sound more similar to that featured on the band's second album, 1999's Hungry Sally & Other Killer Lullabies. The album also contained songs written by new songwriters. Charlie Midnight, who had co-written Tito & Tarantula's 1995 hit song \\"Back to the House (That Love Built)\\", co-wrote the music for \\"Everybody Needs\\". Larriva's former Cruzados bandmate, Steven Hufsteter, co-wrote \\"Crime & Shame\\", \\"World at My Feet\\" and \\"Super Vita Jane\\"; and ended up joining the band as a second lead guitarist.

Anzaldúa. First published in 1981 by Persephone Press. The second edition was published in 1983 by Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press.Short, Kayann. \\"Coming to the Table: The Differential Politics of This Bridge called my Back, Genders 19, 1994, pp. 4–8. The book's third edition was published by Third Woman Press until 2008, when it went out of print. In 2015, the fourth edition was published by State University of New York Press, Albany. The book centers on the experiences of women of color and emphasizes the points of what is now called intersectionality within their multiple identities, challenging white feminists who made claims to solidarity based on sisterhood. Writings in the anthology, along with works by other prominent feminists of color, call for a greater prominence within feminism for race-related subjectivities, and ultimately laid the foundation for third wave feminism. It has become \\"one of the most cited books in feminist theorizing\\" (emphasis in original).Aenerud, Rebecca \\"Thinking Again: This Bridge Called My Back and the Challenge to Whiteness\\" in Impact Though other published writings by women of color existed at the time of This Bridge's printing, many scholars and contributors to This Bridge agree that the bringing together of writing by women of color from diverse backgrounds in one anthology made This Bridge unique and influential. Barbara Smith, a contributor, wrote that Black, Native American, Asian American, and Latina women \\"were involved in autonomous organization at the same time that we [were] beginning to find each other. Certainly This Bridge Called My Back […] has been a document of and a catalyst for these coalitions.\\"Smith, Barbara. Home Girls: a Black Feminist Anthology. New Jersey: Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press, 1983, p. xliv. In addition to providing the framework for new activist-based coalitions, This Bridge has had a considerable impact upon the world of academia for its linking of feminism, race, class, and sexuality. It also brought \\"an intellectual framework\\" of identities based on race and ethnicity to lesbian and gay studies.Escoffier, Jeffrey. American Homo: Community and Perversity. California: University of California Press, 1998, p. 134. In this bridge we call home, the anthology published in 2002 to examine the impacts of This Bridge twenty years later, Australian anthropologist Helen Johnson details This Bridge's effects on institutional teaching environments. She describes how the anthology \\"has allowed her to offer global perspectives on issues of race, gender, ethnicity, and power against the now antiquated white feminists' utopian ideal of universal sisterhood.\\" This Bridge has been hailed for providing an \\"easily accessible discourse, plain speaking, a return to Third World storytelling, voicing a difference in the flesh, not a disembodied subjectivity but a subject location, a political and personal positioning.\\"Calderon, Hector. \\"'A New Connection, a New Set of Recognitions': From This Bridge Called My Back to this bridge we call home\\". From Discourse, 25.1&2\\\\. Wayne State University Press, 2003, pp. 296–301. Though This Bridge is referenced in many essays and books regarding the development of Third World feminism, one of the most widely recognized explorations is Norma Alarcón's essay entitled \\"The Theoretical Subject(s) of This Bridge Called My Back and Anglo-American Feminism.\\" In her essay, Alarcón discusses the importance of looking at relationships not just between gender groups but within gender groups, as highlighted in This Bridge. Through questioning the existence of objective \\"truth\\" as separate from human construction, and through an analysis of language that acknowledges deep contextual and historical meanings, she highlights the intentions of This Bridge to challenge the forces that put all feminists into one category, as well as the oppositional thinking that makes differences hierarchical instead of inter-related and interdependent.Alarcón, Norma. \\"The Theoretical Subject(s) of This Bridge Called My Back and Anglo- American Feminism.\\" From Criticism in the Borderlands. Studies in Chicano Literature, Culture and Ideology. Edited by Hector Calderon and Jose David Saldivar. Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1991. Barbara Smith believed that these messages are made clear within the pages of This Bridge, asserting that \\"more than any other single work, This Bridge has made the vision of Third World feminism real.\\" However, even with these aforementioned impacts, many individuals contend that women of color feminisms still remain marginal within women's studies in the United States. Chela Sandoval, in her essay on third-world feminism, writes: \\"The publication of This Bridge Called My Back in 1981 made the presence of U.S. third world feminism impossible to ignore on the same terms as it had been throughout the 1970s. But soon the writings and theoretical challenges of U.S. third world feminists were marginalized into the category of what Allison Jaggar characterized in 1983 as mere 'description.'\\"Sandoval, Chela. \\"U.S. third world feminism: the theory and method of oppositional consciousness in the postmodern world.\\" From Geographic Thought, edited by George Henderson and Marvin Waterstone. New York: Routledge, 2009, p. 339. This Bridge \\"offered a rich and diverse account of the experience and analyses of women of color; with its collective ethos, its politics of rage and regeneration, and its mix of poetry, critique, fiction and testimony, it challenged the boundaries of feminist and academic discourse.\\" A review of This Bridge We Call Home: Radical Visions for Transformation edited by Gloria E. Anzaldúa and AnaLouise Keating. New York: Routledge, 2002. Anthologists Moraga and Anzaldúa stated in the preface that they expected the book to act as a catalyst, \\"not as a definitive statement on Third World Feminism\\" in the United States.Anzaldúa & Moraga, This Bridge Called My Back, Persephone Press, Author Preface p. xxvi. They also expressed a desire to \\"express to all women, especially white, middle class women, the experiences which divide us as feminists ...we want to create a definition that expands what 'feminist' means.\\"Anzaldúa & Moraga, This Bridge Called My Back, Persephone Press, Author Preface p. xxiii. Teresa de Lauretis noted that This Bridge and All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us Are Brave: Black Women's Studies (1982) created a \\"shift in feminist consciousness\\" by making \\"available to all feminists the feelings, the analyses, and the political positions of feminists of color, and their critiques of white or mainstream feminism.\\"de Lauretis, Teresa \\"The Technology of Gender\\" in Cherríe Moraga, Ana Castillo, and Norma Alarcón adapted this anthology into the Spanish-language Esta puente, mi espalda: Voces de mujeres tercermundistas en los Estados Unidos. Moraga and Castillo served as editors, and Castillo and Alarcón translated the text. In 2002, AnaLouise Keating and Gloria Anzaldúa edited an anthology (this bridge we call home: radical visions for transformation) that examined the impact of This Bridge twenty years later while trying to continue the discussion started by Anzaldúa and Moraga in 1981.

In 1937 Barlow contributed music to the Broadway Musical Amphitryon starring Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne. Barlow composed one other opera, Amanda, which was never performed, and a number of orchestral and chamber music pieces. His compositional style was conservative for his day, and he once stated that he wrote \\"tunes that wouldn't shock Papa Brahms.\\" However, his music was innovative in its frequent exploration of new performance techniques and practices; including the use of slide projections for his adaptation of Babar. Barlow lived much of his life in New York City where he promoted classical music in various civic and professional organizations for several decades; among them was the, of which he was the first chairman. He was also a regular contributor to the journal Modern Music, published by the American League of Composers and in the 1950s served as the President of the board of the American Opera Society.

The company was acquired by Deutsche Bahn as Schenker- Stinnes in 2002. It comprises divisions for air, land, sea freight, and Contract Logistics. History In his biography, then CEO of Deutsche Bahn Hartmut Mehdorn justified the acquisition of international logistics companies with customer demands. In 2000, analysis had shown the 200 largest customers ship up to 60% of their freight abroad. Since the core operating territory had been Germany, customers were lost to competitors with a more compelling international offer. There was no time to grow organically in such markets.Hartmut Mehdorn: «Diplomat wollte ich nie werden». Hoffmann und Campe, Berlin 2007, , p. 114. This analysis led to the acquisition of Stinnes AG and the associated brand name Schenker. Since December 2007 DB Schenker has been the freight logistics subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn. DB Schenker combines all transport and logistic activities of Deutsche Bahn (except rail cargo), employing over 72000 staff spread across about 2,000 locations in about 140 countries.  Organization  Schenker AG and its many subsidiaries handle worldwide logistics operations including Land Transport, Air and Ocean Freight as well as Contract Logistics/SCM, and is part of the DB Schenker organization. Since 2016, rail freight business no longer operates under the brand DB Schenker Rail. Instead, it operates as a standalone business unit under the brand name DB Cargo in Deutsche Bahn Group.  Key Customers  DB Schenker serves many global and local firms across all industries. Notably, DB Schenker manages large and complex supply chains for multinationals such as Apple, Procter & Gamble, Dell, ASML, BMW and many more.  Controversies  In 2016, DB Schenker was convicted for consecutive cases of corruption in St. Petersburg, Russia, bribing local customs officials from 2010 to mid-2012. At the time, DB Schenker involved a Russian agency for enabling the rapid flow of shipments to carmaker Ford’s St. Petersburg facility. DB Schenker had to pay a penalty of €2m. In September 2015, then and current CEO Jochen Thewes slapped and pushed a cab driver, who refused to pick up a drunken Thewes, in downtown Singapore. He also kicked the car and caused damage. Thewes was eventually sentenced to a fine of S$1000 and two weeks of jailtime in Singapore. In 2020, DB Schenker was accused of unfair price dumping during the Coronavirus recession and related market turbulences. Using its status as a state-owned company (as subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn), it offered prices below its own production costs for some European land routes via the freight exchange Timocom.

The location of the spring was described to Bernadette Soubirous by an apparition of Our Lady of Lourdes on 25 February 1858. Since that time, many thousands of pilgrims to Lourdes have followed the instruction of Our Lady of Lourdes to \\"drink at the spring and bathe in it\\". Lourdes water is considered non-liturgical holy water. Although never formally encouraged by the Church, Lourdes water has become a focus of devotion to the Virgin Mary at Lourdes. Since the supposed apparitions, many people have claimed to have been cured by drinking or bathing in it,Ruth Harris, Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age, Penguin Books, 1999, p. 312. and the Lourdes authorities provide it free of charge to any who ask for it.Shipping of Water from the Spring . Lourdes-France.org (2003-10-21). Retrieved on 2011-09-19. Chemical analysis An analysis of the water was commissioned by Anselme Lacadé in 1858. It was conducted by a professor in Toulouse, who determined that the water was potable and that it contained the following: oxygen, nitrogen, carbonic acid, carbonates of lime and magnesia, a trace of carbonate of iron, an alkaline carbonate or silicate, chlorides of potassium and sodium, traces of sulphates of potassium and soda, traces of ammonia, and traces of iodine.Lourdes 4. Nd.edu. Retrieved on 2011-09-19. Essentially, the water is quite pure and inert. Lacadé had hoped that Lourdes water might have special mineral properties which would allow him to develop Lourdes into a spa town, to compete with neighbouring Cauterets and Bagnères-de-Bigorre.Ruth Harris, Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age, Penguin Books, 1999, p. 312. Bathing Primitive makeshift bathing installations were constructed in the 1850s by local builders. Until 1880 there were only two pools, filled by a manual pump. In 1880, a wooden bathing-house containing fourteen pools (\\"piscines\\") was constructed.Ruth Harris, Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age, Penguin Books, 1999, p. 313. The French author Émile Zola visited the Sanctuary in 1891 and again in 1892. He wrote: :And the water was not exactly inviting. The Grotto Fathers were afraid that the output of the spring would be insufficient, so in those days they had the water in the pools changed just twice a day. As some hundred patients passed through the same water, you can imagine what a horrible slop it was at the end. There was everything in it: threads of blood, sloughed-off skin, scabs, bits of cloth and bandage, an abominable soup of ills... the miracle was that anyone emerged alive from this human slime.Émile Zola, Lourdes, 1894, quoted in Ruth Harris, Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age, Penguin Books, 1999, p. 337. During the 1897 Jubilee Pilgrimage to Lourdes, priest François Picard was thirsty after a long day. Rather than drinking fresh water, he asked an assistant to fill his glass from a bathing pool, heavily contaminated from the sick pilgrims who had been immersed in it. \\"When the father had received [the water], he made the sign of the cross and drank slowly, right to the end. Then, he gave back the glass and concluded with a smile: \\"The water of the good Mother of Heaven is always delicious.\\"A. Pépin, \\"Le Père François Picard: directeur de l'association de Notre-Dame de Salut at des pèlerinages nationaux\\", Pages d'archives no.3 (November 1963) p. 225, quoted in Ruth Harris, Lourdes: Body and Spirit in the Secular Age, Penguin Books, 1999, p. 246. The next set of piscines was completed in 1891, and tiled in the Virgin's blue. This building was located near to where the water taps are now and can be seen on old photographs of the Domain. The current baths were constructed in 1955, and upgraded in 1972 and 1980. There are seventeen separate bath cubicles, eleven for women and six for men. Each year about 350,000 people use the baths.In the Baths. Lourdes-France.org (2003-10-21). Retrieved on 2011-09-19. The water is not heated and is usually cold; the temperature is around 12 °C (54 °F). The immersion lasts around a minute, during which time prayers are recited and veneration of a statue of the Virgin is encouraged. Able-bodied pilgrims are aided by one or two volunteer attendants, but immobile pilgrims sometimes require much more physical help. The water in each bath is constantly being topped up and refreshed via a pump. It is now constantly circulated and purified by irradiation.According to one of the chaplains interviewed in the 2008 EWTN documentary The Lourdes Experience. Modern times Operated by the Marist Fathers, The Lourdes Center in Kenmore Square (Boston, Massachusetts) was established in 1950 by Cardinal Richard J. Cushing and Bishop Pierre-Marie Theas to distribute Lourdes water in the United States. Lourdes water flows from a spring in the Grotto at the same spot where it was discovered by Bernadette. At maximum, the water flows at 40 litres per minute.Oliver Todd, The Lourdes Pilgrim, Matthew James Publishing, 2003, p. 42. The water is collected in a cistern, and dispensed via a system of taps near the shrine, where pilgrims may drink it or collect it in bottles or other containers to take with them. The original spring can be seen within the Grotto, lit from below, and protected by a glass screen. Over the last few years the system of taps has been progressively altered. As of 2008, water is dispensed from a series of taps set into stone in a circle around the base of one of the smaller towers of the Upper Basilica. In 2002 the Water Walk was introduced, across the Gave and slightly downstream from the Grotto. It consists of a series of nine stations at which there is a small Lourdes water font. The stations form a walkway along the Gave which can be followed in either direction. As they walk, pilgrims are invited to wash or drink, and meditate on passages from the Bible. Each station carries one of the titles of the Virgin Mary, such as \\"Queen of the Apostles\\", \\"Mother of Good Counsel\\", and \\"Our Lady of Light\\".Lourdes: A People from Every Nation, Service Promotion des Sanctuaires Notre-Dame de Lourdes, 2002, p. 10. Traditionally, pilgrims collect gallons of water at the taps to be given to family and friends unable to make the trip to Lourdes. As of summer 2007, Mistral Air passengers on pilgrimage to Lourdes were forbidden to bring containers of water on the plane. Officials at Tarbes Airport said this was in keeping with new anti- terrorism regulations about liquids following the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot.Air pilgrims face holy water ban. BBC News, 2007-08-29, retrieved 2008-07-31.

According to the Orkneyinga Saga, she was an ambitious and scheming woman who sought power through the men of the family of Thorfinn Torf-Einarsson, who was Earl of Orkney. The period after Thorfinn's death was one of dynastic strife. Thorfinn had five sons: (Arnfinn, Havard, Hlodvir, Ljot, Skuli) and at least two daughters, each of whom had a son called Einar. In Orkneyinga Saga it is stated that Ragnhild Eriksdotter first married Arnfinn Thorfinnsson, eldest son of Thorfinn. Her husband was subsequently murdered at Murkle in Caithness sometime around 979.Stenton, F. M. (1971) Anglo-Saxon England. Oxford University Press, page 362. Her next husband was Arnfinn's brother, Havard Thorfinnsson who may have been involved in his brother's murder. Havard became Earl of Orkney and promptly married his brother's widow. Next Ragnhild convinced Thorfinn grandson, Einar Klining, to kill Havard for which she would marry him and make him Earl. Havard was killed in Stenness, Orkney, though the date is uncertain. Before Einar Klining could marry her, Ragnhild had promised Einar Hardkiopt, another grandson of Thorfinn, the same thing, if he would kill Einar Klining. This he did, but then Ragnhild took Havard's younger brother Liot Thorfinnsson as her husband. After Liot went on to defend Orkney and claim the Earldom, he died of his wounds from the battle of Skidmoor in Caithness. No more is heard of Ragnhild after that event. Hlodvir Thorfinnsson then became Earl of Orkney. In time, he was succeeded by his son, Sigurd the Stout. References Other sources *Crawford, Barbara E.

He took to the piano early and by the age of 12 had secured a post as organist at Herbert Street Methodist Church in Devonport.Devonport Morice Town Primitive Methodist Chapel, Herbert Street. The church was destroyed in the Second World War His first opera, The Forest Enchanted, was completed in 1928 when he was 17, and produced locally with Bate conducting.Obituary, Musical Times, December 1959, p 680-1 Winning a scholarship to the Royal College of Music, he studied under Ralph Vaughan Williams, R.O. Morris, Gordon Jacob, and Arthur Benjamin. Compositions from this time include the String Quartet No 1 (1936) and the Symphony No 1 in Eb, which was first performed at the College in 1936. He went on to study abroad, for two years, first in Paris with Nadia Boulanger and then in Berlin with Paul Hindemith. On his return to the UK in 1937 Bate was commissioned to compose the Concertino for piano and chamber orchestra, performed at the Eastbourne Music Festival in February 1938 with Frederic Lamond as the soloist, conducted by Kneale Kelly.Radio Times, Issue 749, 8 February 1938, p. 45, Genome.ch.bbc.co.uk Bate also began writing incidental music for theatre director Michel Saint-Denis (including productions of Twelfth Night and The Cherry Orchard) and produced two ballet scores - Perseus for Les Trois Arts and Cap Over Mill, for Ballet Rambert. While at the College Bate met Australian-born fellow student and composer Peggy Granville-Hicks. Although Bate was openly homosexual they married in 1938 and remained together until a divorce in 1949. She was very supportive of his career, at some cost to her own. There were also reports of domestic violence. After the divorce Bate married the Brazilian diplomat Margarida Guedes Nogueira. At the outbreak of war Bate embarked on British Council funded tours of the US, Australia and Brazil, promoting British culture. With Glanville-Hicks he moved to America in 1941 and saw great successes there, including a performance in February 1942 at Carnegie Hall of his Second Piano Concerto by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Thomas Beecham with the composer as soloist. A grant by the Guggenheim Foundation in April 1942 helped with funding. Other successful US premieres included the Sinfonietta No 1 in 1942 (ISCM, Berkeley California), the String Quartet No 2, given by the Lener Quartet in 1943, and the Viola Concerto in 1946, performed by Emanuel Vardi with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Returning to the UK in 1949 (via Brusssels and Paris), Bate found it hard to replicate his international successes at home. However, the Violin Concerto No 3 (1947–50) received a successful performance at the Royal Festival Hall with the London Symphony Orchestra and Antonio Brosa soloist in 1953. The premiere of the Symphony No 3 at the Cheltenham Festival in 1954 - some fourteen years after its completion'First performance after 14 years: Bate's Third Symphony', Manchester Guardian, 16 July 1954, p 5 \\\\- was unanimously well received by critics. The Musical Times called it \\"exhilarating, hard-hitting music\\".Musical Times No 1339, September 1954, p 491 The BBC has been criticised for its lack of support for his music, but it did stage the world premiere of his Piano Concerto No 3 at the Proms on 30 August 1957 with the composer as soloist and Malcolm Sargent conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra. And the first broadcast of the Symphony No 4 was given on 3 April 1958 by the BBC Northern Orchestra, conducted by Lawrence Leonard.Radio Times Issue 1794, 30 March 1958, p 47, Genome.ch.bbc.co.uk Short of money and depressed by his lack of recognition, Bate died in 1959 aged 47, having suffered a breakdown a few months before. The coroner's verdict was death due to complications of alcohol, though other reports suggested a drug overdose. Music The music of Stanley Bate quickly fell into obscurity following his death. The Third Symphony (1940) was long regarded as his best work in his home country, although critics were quick to point out its influences. \\"The second subject of the first movement is almost pure Vaughan Williams, the slow movement almost pure Hindemith, and Boulanger's influence may be detected in the Stravinskian rhythms of the last movement\\", wrote the Manchester Guardian critic. The opening of Walton's landmark Symphony No 1, which preceded it by five years, can also be heard in the opening figures of the finale. Mark Lehman described the work as \\"very much a 'war symphony' with kinships to the contemporaneous symphonies of Arthur Benjamin, Richard Arnell and Bernard Herrmann\\".American Record Guide, May/June 2010, p 61 There was a further performance of the Third Symphony at Cheltenham in 1965, but it took until 2006 for a new performance to be broadcast, followed by a commercial recording in 2010.Royal Scottish Orchestra, conducted by Martin Yates, Dutton 7239 (2010) That same year a recording of the Viola Concerto (1944-6) by Roger Chase and the BBC Concert Orchestra conducted by Stephen Bell helped spark a modern revival of interest.Dutton Vocalion CDLX 7216, Duttonvocalion.co.uk This intensively lyrical work also immediately brings to mind the music of Vaughan Williams, to whom it is dedicated.

Route description The route begins as a continuation of SR-106 at a diamond interchange on US-89 at exit 397. The road heads northwest on Main Street in Farmington, a four-lane undivided highway. A golf course appears on the northern end of the street. The road enters Kaysville and turns north briefly before turning west on 200 North. The route continues west five blocks before a diamond interchange with I-15 at exit 328 appears. Immediately after this intersection, SR-273 terminates at the junction of 600 West, a road paralleling the freeway. History The road from Farmington northwest through Kaysville to Layton was added to the state highway system in 1910,Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated September 2007, accessed May 2008 and in the 1920s it became part of SR-1 and US-91.Rand McNally Auto Road Atlas, 1926 SR-1 was moved to the present alignment of I-15 in that area in 1953, and the old route became SR-106. The state legislature removed the portion of SR-106 between 200 North in Kaysville and I-15 in southern Layton from the state highway system in 1969, and instead took SR-106 west on 200 North to end at I-15.Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated November 2007, accessed May 2008 200 North had been State Route 110 since 1931, initially running west from SR-1 (later SR-106) in Kaysville to West Kaysville. In 1941, it was extended east to SR-49 (US-89), and in 1969 it was all eliminated except for the piece that became SR-106.Utah Department of Transportation, State Route History , accessed July 2007 However, before the 1969 amendments became effective, the State Road Commission further truncated SR-106 due to the planned reconstruction of North Farmington Junction, where SR-106 crossed SR-49 (US-89). Traffic would no longer be able to cross US-89 at that point, nor could southbound traffic turn left from US-89 to SR-106.USGS aerial photography, accessed June 2008 via ACME Mapper To retain full access, SR-106 was sent west on Shepard Lane in Farmington to end at US-89, while the old alignment became two new routes: State Route 272 from Shepard Lane to US-89 and State Route 273 from US-89 to I-15 in Layton. An interchange replaced the old intersection at North Farmington Junction in about 2000,Federal Highway Administration, National Bridge Inventory database, 2006 and in 2001 SR-272 became part of SR-273.

Since then, he has performed with orchestras across the world and composed a number of modern classical works. His music was described as \\"a major new addition to the 21st century symphonic literature\\" by Fanfare Magazine with having \\"heart-rending melodies, lush orchestration, clever transitions and creative textures\\" by American Record Guide. Jandali's music ranges from chamber works to large symphonic compositions integrating Middle-Eastern and Western influences.https://indychoir.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/A-New-East-West- Polyphony-Symphony-Magazine-Summer-2015.pdf  Life  Malek Jandali was born to Dr Mamoun Jandali and Linah Droubi. He has a brother, Rami.https://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/24/world/meast/syria-jandali/index.html Jandali is a cousin of Apple founder Steve Jobs and his biological sister Mona Simpson, a novelist and English teacher at UCLA. He began his musical career as a classical pianist. He studied at the Arab Institute of Music in Damascus with Vladimir Zaritsky and Victor Bunin of the Tchaikovsky Moscow Conservatory. Jandali won first place in the Syrian National Young Artists Competition in 1988, and in 1995 received a scholarship to attend North Carolina School of the Arts under Eric Larsen. He graduated from Queens University, where he studied under Paul Nitsch and received the Outstanding Musical Performer Award of the school.

He has a special interest in Arab music and combines the maqamat or modes with western harmony in his piano and orchestral compositions. Malek's compositions not only integrate Middle-Eastern modes into Western classical forms and harmony, they echo UNESCO's call to preserve and protect the rich cultural heritage of Syria and the Silk Road at a time when it is being eradicated. He incorporates ancient melodies from Aleppo, Damascus and other stops on the Silk Road in his compositions. He released his first album of compositions for piano and orchestra, Echoes from Ugarit, in June 2009. The album was briefly in the international music charts of the United Arab Emirates. The title track is based on a hymn to Nikkal, one of the Hurrian songs inscribed on cuneiform clay tablets discovered in Ugarit, Syria, and thought to date from 1400 BC and thus to be the oldest notated music in the world. Malek Jandali composer In early 2012 Jandali released his album Emessa (Homs), which he dedicated to \\"the Syrian people and their noble quest for freedom - especially the people of Homs\\". The album includes his Freedom Qashoush Symphony, named for Ibrahim Qashoush, who wrote a song popular with Syrian protesters and who was killed and had his vocal cords torn out. Jandali's Syrian Symphony was released in late 2014 and premiered at Carnegie Hall in January 2015. The album includes three major works, \\"Syrian Symphony\\" presented in four movements recorded with the Russian Philharmonic Orchestra, \\"Variations for Piano and Orchestra\\", based on the ancient Syrian theme Lamma Bada Yatathana, which dates back more than 1,000 years, and \\"Phoenix in Exile\\", recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London. In 2015 his latest album SoHo was released, which tells the story of his journey from Syria to SoHo in New York City and contains compositions that are inspired by and named after the works of Sufi poets Rumi and Ibn Arabi as well as poets Rita Dove, Gabriela Mistral among others. The album features his chamber works for piano, oud and cello performed by the Malek Jandali Trio.  Activism and other endeavors  Jandali is the founder of nonprofit organization Pianos for Peace, which aspires to use the power of music to enrich communities through an annual outdoor festival and several year-round community outreach programs serving under-resourced local schools and organizations in Atlanta. He is also the founder of the Malek Jandali International Youth Piano Competition, which encourages talented young pianists from around the globe to embrace the music of their homelands and submit applications for the chance to perform at Carnegie Hall in New York City. Jandali frequently contributes to charity events collaborating with international organization's UNICEF, MSF, Save The Children among others to raise humanitarian aid for children in need around the world. He has visited refugee camps in Turkey, Syria, Croatia and Malta to raise awareness and humanitarian aid for refugees, and was inspired to launch his ongoing world tour \\"The Voice of the Free Syrian Children\\" in 2013. That same year he was awarded the GUSI International Peace Prize for his humanitarian and peace activism. In 2014 Jandali was awarded the Global Music Humanitarian Award for his contribution to peace and justice for the Syrian children. Malek Jandali - Notes For My Homeland Inspired by stories from the Arab Spring, in April 2011 Jandali wrote Watani Ana (I am my Homeland). In June his scheduled appearance at the annual convention of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) was cancelled, reportedly because he planned to perform Watani Ana. The initial statement issued by the ADC did not make clear the reason for the cancellation, and attracted criticism from other organizations including the Arab-American Institute. The ADC issued a further statement in April 2012, in which it said that it had reached \\"an amicable resolution\\" with Jandali. In July 2011 Jandali performed Watani Ana at a protest in Lafayette Park. Shortly afterwards, his parents, Dr. Mamoun Jandali and Lina Droubi, were severely beaten and their home in Homs was ransacked. Jandali blamed Syrian security forces for the attack, and told reporters that as his mother was beaten, she was told \\"we're going to teach you how to raise your son.\\" Photographs published on Facebook showed evidence that the couple had been brutally beaten. In September two armed attackers broke into the house and again ransacked it; Jandali's parents were not there as they had fled Syria after the previous attack. Jandali is regularly invited to speak and participate in panel discussions and academic workshops. He was on the panel of the 2012 Doha Debates at Georgetown University in Qatar and was featured in the 2014 BBC series \\"What Freedom Looks Like\\". In 2016, he spoke at the annual Skoll World Forum at Oxford University and Aspen Ideas Festival. Jandali has given lectures, masterclasses and workshops at numerous universities and institutions such as Duke, Rutgers, Fordham, CU Boulder, the Hammer Museum and Complutense University of Madrid.

Formation After the death of Lt. General Thomas J. Jackson at the Battle of Chancellorsville, Robert E. Lee reorganized his army from two infantry corps into three corps, giving command of the new Third Corps to A. P. Hill. For Hill's new corps, Lee assigned Hill's old \\"Light Division\\", commanded by Major General William Dorsey Pender, from the Second Corps and Richard H. Anderson's division from James Longstreet's First Corps. For the Corps' third division, Lee created a new division from two brigades sent from the defenses around Richmond and two brigades from Pender's division, assigning it to the command of Henry Heth. The corps' artillery reserve was commanded by Colonel R. Lindsay Walker.Sears 2003, pp. 43-47, 542. 1863 When Lee launched the Gettysburg Campaign in June 1863, the Third Corps was initially left along the former Confederate positions along the Rappahannock as a rear guard, following the rest of the army on the 15th after Lee was convinced that Union commander Joseph Hooker would not launch an attack on Richmond. It arrived at Chambersburg on the 27th and rested for several days; on the evening of June 30th, Hill sent Heth's division to Gettysburg to seize a supply of shoes that was reported to be there, with Pender's division assigned to follow as support.Sears 2003, pp. 60, 94, 136-138. On the morning of July 1st, Heth encountered the leading elements of the Army of the Potomac, thus starting the three-day Battle of Gettysburg. During the morning, Heth's division attacked part of the I Corps and was defeated, with Brigadier General James J. Archer captured (the first general officer in Lee's army to be captured). Both Heth's and Pender's divisions attacked during the afternoon and defeated the I Corps; Heth was wounded during the afternoon attack and was replaced by James J. Pettigrew, while Alfred M. Scales of Pender's division was wounded.Sears 2003, pp. 170-179, 206-211, 217-220. On the second day, Hill's corps occupied the center of the Confederate army and was assigned to attack the Union line after Longstreet's corps had launched its attack; however, only three of Anderson's five brigades launched an attack. Ambrose R. Wright was able to briefly pierce the Union center on Cemetery Ridge but was forced to retreat. Before he was able to launch an attack with his division, Pender was mortally wounded by an artillery shell and was replaced by Brigadier General James H. Lane. During the day, Hill was ill and did not supervise the attack by his corps.Sears 2003, pp. 256, 306-307, 313-318, 322-323, 359. As part of Lee's plans on July 3rd, part of Hill's corps took part in Pickett's charge but was placed under Longstreet's command: Pettigrew's division was placed to the left of George Pickett's division, while two of Lane's brigades, placed under the command of Major General Isaac Trimble, formed behind Pettigrew (Lane returned to command his own brigade during the attack). Cadmus Wilcox's and David Lang's brigades of Anderson's division formed on Pickett's right, while the rest of the division formed behind Pettigrew and Trimble as support. For the bombardment before the infantry attack, Walker formed fifty-three cannons along Seminary Ridge. During the attack, one Union regiment attacked Pettigrew's right flank brigade, commanded by John M. Brockenbrough, and routed it, then commenced firing on the next brigade in line.Sears 2003, pp. 358-359, 380, 386-387, 422-424. Pettigrew's and Trimble's divisions reached to stone wall on Cemetery Ridge but failed to breach the Union line; the 55th North Carolina Infantry was credited with making the farthest advance of any Confederate regiment during the attack. Pettigrew was wounded during the attack but remained in command of his division; Trimble was wounded and captured near the wall, while two brigade commanders were also wounded and one was killed. Sears 2003, pp. 429-435, 455; Tucker, pp. 3680- 375. Wilcox and Lang started their advance well after the main force had done so; by the time the two brigades reached the Union line, Pickett's division had already started its retreat. Artillery fire and a counterattack by the Vermont Brigade forced them to retreat, with several dozen Confederates falling prisoner and two battle flags captured.Sears 2003, pp. 454-455. After the battle, Hill's corps was the first to start the Confederate retreat back to Virginia. Heth's division served as the rear guard as the army marched over the Potomac on July 14th; during the Battle of Falling Waters, Pettigrew was mortally wounded during a Union cavalry charge.Sears 2003, pp. 479, 490-492. During the fall, Cadmus Wilcox was promoted to major general and given command of Pender's former division. In the Battle of Bristoe Station, Hill attacked the isolated Union II Corps with only two brigades from his three available divisions, but was in turn hit in the flank by the awaiting V Corps. Hill lost heavily, 2,000 men in total along with five cannons. The corps also participated in the Mine Run Campaign; Hill was to assault the Union left flank at dawn on December 1, but the Union army retreated during the night. For the rest of the winter, the corps remained in winter camps south of the Rappahannock River.Robertson 1987, pp. 230, 233-239, 242-244. 1864 Wartime photo of III Corps divisional commander William Mahone At the start of the Overland Campaign, the corps started with a strength of over 22,000 men. The Third corps fought on the Confederate right wing during the first day of the Battle of the Wilderness, engaged with the II Corps. By the end of the day, Hill's line was jumbled; both Heth and Wilcox requested permission to straighten their lines during the night but Hill refused, believing that Longstreet would arrive before dawn and relieve his corps. On the second day, the Union army attacked at dawn and quickly drove Hill's troops back in confusion. Longstreet's corps arrived near mid-morning and halted the Union attack. Following Longstreet's wounding, Anderson was transferred to command the First Corps, with William Mahone taking command of Anderson's division.Trudeau 1989, pp. 7, 62, 76-78, 86-97, 122. During the march to Spotsylvania Court House on May 8th, Hill fell ill and was replaced by Jubal Early from the Second Corps. Early arrived at Spotsylvania near dawn on May 9th and covered the Confederate right wing. The corps held against the attacks of the IX Corps during May 12th but was only able to send two brigades to help with the Confederate counterattacks in the Mule Shoe salient. On May 21st, Hill reported that he was well enough to resume command of his corps.Trudeau 1989, pp. 131, 144, 175, 179-180, 212. During the Battle of North Anna, the Third Corps was positioned on the Confederate left. On May 23rd, Wilcox's division attacked the V Corps as it was crossing the North Anna near Jericho Mill; faulty intelligence had led him to believe that only two Union cavalry brigades had crossed the river. Wilcox launched his attack about 6 p.m. and initially routed two Union brigades but was driven back by a Union counterattack before Confederate reinforcements arrived. Wilcox lost 730 men while inflicting only 338 casualties on the Union forces. During the rest of the battle, the corps was engaged in only brief skirmishing.Trudeau 1989, pp. 228-235; Rhea, pp. 303-318, 323, 339-342. At Cold Harbor, Hill was stationed on the Confederate left flank but on June 2 Mahone's and Wilcox's divisions were moved to the Confederate right in response to the movements of the Union II Corps; Heth's division remained on the left. On June 3rd, an attack by the Union II Corps briefly overran part of the Confederate line to Hill's left but the Florida Brigade counterattacked an recaptured the line.Trudeau 1989, pp. 284-286, 288-290; Furgurson, pp. 124-125, 144-148. Following Cold Harbor, the corps was rushed to the Richmond- Petersburg area where it was engaged in the three-day Battle of Petersburg. The corps fought along the Confederate defensive works south of the Appomattox River during the Siege of Petersburg and over the next few months halted several of the Union offenses against the Confederate supply lines, such as at Jerusalem Plank Road, Ream's Station, and the Crater. Hill was ill several times during the siege, which forced him to turn operational control of the corps over to his division commanders, such as at Ream's Station. The corps lost several hundred men due to desertions during the winter.Trudeau 1991, pp. 68, 71-77; Robertson, pp. 290-294, 298-301, 308, 310-311. 1865 Wartime photo of III Corps divisional commander and temporary corps commander Henry Heth During the Third Battle of Petersburg, Union assaults overran the Confederate defensive works near Petersburg; while trying to rally his men and to halt the Union advance, Hill ran into Union troops and was killed. Henry Heth temporarily took command of the Third Corps as it evacuated Petersburg but it eventually was merged with James Longstreet's First Corps. The corps' divisions formed part of the Confederate rear guard at Amelia Court House but was shifted to the front of the army as the Confederates marched over Sailor's Creek. Following the Confederate defeat in the Battle of Sailor's Creek, Mahone's division covered the retreat from the creek.Marvel 2002, pp. 19, 61,-62, 67-68, 88, 91. At the Battle of Cumberland Church, Mahone's division formed the Confederate left flank and repulsed a Union attack, while Wilcox's division covered the Confederate right flank. For the rest of the campaign, the corps saw only minor skirmishing as part of the Confederate rear guard and surrendered with the rest of the Confederate army on April 9.Calkins 1997, pp. 131-133, 147-148.

Originally designated FLB (for \\"Flying Life Boat\\"), it was a conventional high-wing cantilever monoplane with a flying boat hull and outrigger pontoons mounted on the wings slightly outboard of mid-span. The twin pusher engines were carried in separate nacelles on pylons above the wings. The hull was a monocoque metal structure, and the wing was a wooden structure skinned with plywood. The basic design was based on that of the Fokker F.11, but substantially enlarged (Fokker's American operation was renamed General Aviation after purchase by General Motors in 1930). While not a true amphibian and able to land on dry land, the PJ was equipped with retractable undercarriage that functioned as its own, self-carrying beaching trolley. Five examples were operated by the US Coast Guard during the 1930s, named Antares, Altair, Acrux, Acamar, and Arcturus (hull numbers FLB-51 through FLB-55). In 1933, Antares underwent a major refit that included a redesign of her engine nacelles, converting these to tractor configuration.

It is a scrambling and a twining herb that can become an aggressive weed once established, making it an invasive species in some countries. However, it is grown as an ornamental plant for its satiny foliage and sweet-scented flowers.La Concepción y sus doce embajadoras by La Opinión de Málaga Senecio angulatus can be distinguished vegetatively from Delairea odorata by the lack of lobes at the leaf stalk base, the fleshy leaf surface and the outwardly curved leaf teeth. Senecio tamoides has been misapplied in Australia and is currently considered to be Senecio angulatus. Description =Leaves and stems= Leaves of S. angulatus. Its form is a dense tangled shrub tall or a climber that can reach high, if suitable support is available. The leaves are to long and to wide and occur in 1-4 pairs. They are thick, glossy, fleshy and coarsely toothed, with one to three teeth each side and bluntly lobed, with upper leaves becoming smaller with fewer teeth or none at all. They have a frosted look from a powdery coating on the lower side. Leaf stalks are to long. The leaves have stalks or stems which embrace the larger leaf surface which is not lobed, oval to triangularly shaped or very blunt to pointed at the tips and blunt to flat at the base. The leaves have a frosted look from a powdery coating on the lower side. The stems are succulent, pale green, and are often variegated with pale yellow green and purple. They are slightly angular (not upright) and usually sparingly branched. Neither stems nor leaves are hairy. =Inflorescence= Flowers of S. angulatus. Senecio angulatus produces numerous flowers in open clusters at the end of its branches or stems. The strongly scented flowers are on an elongated stem that continue to open in succession from the base up as the stem continues to grow. The mass of clusters end more flat at the top than pyramid-like, and are to in diameter. Often the cluster droops with the flower heads at the end of the cluster turning upwards. Flower stalks are mostly hairless or with some short hairs, to long. Flower heads are attached to flower stalk by fine pointed 8-11 bracts to which are surrounded by 4-7 pale green and sometimes purple tinged at the base supplementary bracts, 1.5 millimetres to 2.5 millimetres which make a cup shape around the base of the involucre. Each stalk is capable of producing 10-15 disc florets. Flower-heads are radiate and urn-shaped. Ray florets are nearly always absent. When they occur, there is a yellow ligule. The corolla has a yellow disc surrounded by 4–6 dull golden yellow disc florets to long with hairless tubes, a slight expansion below the middle and lobes 1.3 millimetres to 2 millimetres wide. S. angulatus flower heads have rays (that look like petals) that make it more daisy-like unlike D. odorata which doesn't. It flowers from April to May in Southern Africa and May to July in Australia and New Zealand. =Fruits and reproduction= Creeping groundsel is easily dispersed by wind-blown seed, stem fragments, and dumped garden waste. Achenes are 3 millimetres to 4 millimetres long, ribbed or grooved with short hairs in the grooves and a tapering cylindrical shape. The parachute- like hairs, the pappus, are 5 millimetres to 7 millimetres long. Cultivation The plant is predominantly cultivated in North Africa, the Mediterranean Basin and the Levant. In Queensland, climbing groundsel may have increased in popularity following the Boer War, as there were anecdotal accounts that it was introduced from South Africa by the soldiers who returned to Australia after 1902. Moreover, it was displayed in garden pillars in Brisbane newspapers between 1906-1910, praising the plant for the beauty of both its foliage and its yellow clusters of blooms.Climbing Groundsel (Senecio angulatus) by Weeds of Melbourne, July 10, 2019 The plant grows in USDA hardiness zones 9a through 11b and is medium to fast-growing. Very drought tolerant, it would flourish better with some water in the summer and would bloom more often in full sun. It can grow indoors as a houseplant, provided it gets some sunlight. Pruning is necessary as the plant can become limp when it gets taller. Pests include aphids.Climbing Groundsel (Senecio angulatus) by Weeds of Melbourne, July 10, 2019 Propagation can be done by cuttings (as the plant easily roots from the branch tips), and this is to be conducted between spring and fall (since it is somewhat winter dormant).Senecio angulatus (Climbing Groundsel) by World of Succulents, August 30, 2013Creeping or climbing groundsel (Senecio angulatus) by Eurobodalla Shire Council Seeds prefer consistent moisture and warm temperatures to germinate. Annual fertilisation is necessary, though not mandatory. Distribution It is native to the Cape Province in South Africa, but is naturalized in parts of South Italy, France, Portugal and some coastal areas in southeastern Australia. It is invasive New Zealand and Victoria, Australia. Because it is aggressive, it can smother the existing native vegetation both in the ground layer and canopy, thus altering the light climate in the invaded community and sometimes suppress the regeneration of native plants.

The governmental agency to provide mail and telecommunication services for West Berlin. This civil service agency was in operation from 1949 until 1990. Historical background With the end of World War II in 1945, the Allied Control Commission replaced the German government. Germany was divided into four occupation zones, and Berlin into four sectors; the territories east of the Oder-Neisse were placed under Polish authority. Initially Berlin and the provinces in the Soviet zone issued their own stamps (see Scott # 11N2), but by 1946 \\"Deutsche Post\\" stamps were authorized that were valid in the American, British, and Soviet zones.Michel Deutschland Spezial 1997, p. 799 Russian occupation stamp for Berlin, 1945, Scott 11N2 When the negotiations about a general German currency reform broke down, the western zones proceeded with the currency reform, and on June 21, 1948, the Deutsche Mark was introduced.Michel Deutschland Spezial 1997, p. 893 In response, the east German currency reform was set for June 24, 1948, the East German Mark became the currency for the Soviet occupation zone and East Berlin, and its stamps were marked with overprints. This established the economic separation of the two German states. In July 1948, the stamps of the previously common issue were overprinted with \\"Soviet Occupation Zone\\" and subsequently the Soviet zone issued different stamps than the western zone, all, however, under the \\"Deutsche Post\\" label.Michel Deutschland Spezial 1997, p. 911ff West Berlin now started to issue its own stamps on September 3, 1948, initially \\"Berlin\\" overprinted common stamps of the \\"Deutsche Post\\".Michel Deutschland Spezial 1997, p. 1317, p. 1320 The Deutsche Mark (West) became the sole currency for West Berlin on March 21, 1949, and seven months later the stamps of the western bizone as well as the French occupation zone became valid as well.Michel Deutschland Spezial 1997, p. 1317 The Federal Republic of Germany was founded on May 23, 1949, and shortly thereafter, the formation of the German Democratic Republic took place on October 7, 1949.Michel Deutschland Spezial 1997, p. 929 and p.1549 In each republic the \\"Deutsche Post\\" now became the government agency to maintain postal and telecommunication services, in West Germany the \\"Deutsche Post\\" was renamed \\"Deutsche Bundespost\\" in 1950, and in East Germany the term DP (of the GDR) was kept. West Berlin retained its special status as it remained under the authority of the American, British, and French occupation forces.

According to the Scott catalog, during its 41 years the DBP Berlin issued close to 900 stamps, namely 592 different stamps including many commemoratives, plus 285 semi-postal designs; there are no air mail stamps or official stamps. Topics of commemoratives and semipostals include common topicals (i.e. nature, sports, arts), science and technical issues and historical stamps. Additional stamps of the DP consisted of official stamps (44 types). All stamps were issued in West Deutsche Mark and were valid in Western Germany too. The last stamp was issued on September 27, 1990 (Mi #879). With the 1990 reunification, the DBP Berlin became part of the Deutsche Bundespost which in turn was five years later converted into the Deutsche Post AG.

History  Before 1902, the Navy had at least two books for training young men in naval procedure. Seamanship, by Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, was the primary textbook about seamanship at the United States Naval Academy but was not used by enlisted men; many sailors at the time were still illiterate and in any case, the oral traditions and procedures of petty officers were the basis of enlisted sailors' education. The Seaman's Handbook by LCDR Stephen B. Luce, saw general use in the Merchant Marine, but less in the Navy. 1902 saw the first publication of The Bluejacket's Manual, written by Lieutenant Ridley McLean, as well as the Recruit's Handy Book. Every enlistee received the latter, and by World War I, both were being issued to every recruit. The Handy Book was discontinued in the 1920s. Some manuals published between 1903 and early 1915 have inconsistent edition numbering. The 1903, 1905, 1907 and 1908 were considered the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th editions by the authors and the Naval Institute. In 1914, Franklin Publishing was contracted to publish the 1914 and 1915 book and pamphlet manuals. Because 1914 was the first time Franklin published the manual, they published their edition as the First Edition, the early 1915 version as the 2nd and the late 1915 one as the 3rd. A single numbering system was restored with the 3rd edition, late 1915 Manual. =Centennial Edition= The 2002 Centennial Edition, also called the 23rd Edition, saw several modifications, including a reversion to its original title: Bluejacket's. The \\"Navy Education and Training\\" chapter was expanded and the \\"Naval Missions and Heritage\\" chapter was added. The current (25th) edition's official author is retired Commander Thomas J.

Early life  Eyraud was born in Saint- Bonnet-en-Champsaur, France, in 1820. He became a mechanic by profession. He went to Bolivia, and acquired mining interests there.  Arrival on Easter Island Eyraud entered the Holy Ghost Fathers as a novice. Influenced by his brother Jean, a missionary in China, he left Chile for Tahiti in 1862 and arrived at Hanga Roa on 2 January 1864. He was harassed by the islanders, and only stayed nine months before being repatriated to Chile on 11 October 1864. A year and a half later, on 27 March 1866, he settled on the island as a full priest, accompanied by Hippolyte Roussel and three Mangarevan converts.  Activities  Although fiercely opposed at first, Eyraud eventually came to be highly popular and influential among the islanders. In October 1866, Gaspar Zumbohm and Théodule Escolan joined Eyraud and Roussel in their mission, and set up schools at Hanga Roa and Vaihū. On 22 December 1866 Eyraud wrote He assisted that year in what would be the last ceremony of the Birdman cult. Eyraud brought tuberculosis to the island in 1867, which led to the death of a quarter of the island's population, and died of it on 23 August 1868, nine days after the last islanders had been baptized. He was buried at the Holy Cross Church, Hanga Roa.  Rongorongo  During his first stay, Eyraud remarked that in each house there were wooden tablets covered with \\"hieroglyphs\\", now known as rongorongo, but that the islanders no longer knew how to read them and paid them scant attention. He didn't think of informing Roussel or Zumbohm, and never wrote of them again. In wasn't until 1869, when Zumbohm presented a gift which, unknown to him included a tablet, to Bishop Jaussen in Tahiti, that rongorongo was noticed by the outside world. Traditional beliefs Eyraud wrote of the islanders and their carved wooden statues, known as mo‘ai kavakava  Bibliography  * Orliac, Catherine; Orliac, Michel.

Early life and education Born in Enola, Pennsylvania, Kanaskie grew up in nearby Mechanicsburg and attended Cumberland Valley High School, in which he was an all-state basketball player. Kanaskie later attended La Salle College (now La Salle University) and played basketball for the La Salle Explorers under head coach Lefty Ervin from 1976 to 1980. As a senior in 1979–80, Kanaskie averaged 14.5 points and 2.7 rebounds and helped La Salle win the ECC Tournament and make the 1980 NCAA Tournament.https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/la- salle/1980.html Kanaskie graduated from La Salle in 1980 with a Bachelor of Science in business administration. Coaching career In the 1980 NBA draft, the Golden State Warriors selected Kanaskie as the second pick in the eighth round, 162nd overall. That year, Kanaskie became a college basketball assistant coach at South Carolina under Bill Foster. After five years in that position, Kanaskie served as head coach at Division II Lock Haven University from 1985 to 1988. Inheriting a program that won only 18 games in the past four seasons, Kanaskie led Lock Haven to 15 wins in his first season and ended with a 55–32 overall record.Search Kurt Kanaskie in NCAA Coaching Statistics The Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC) named Kanaskie its Coach of the Year for the West Division in 1987 and 1988 and co-Coach of the Year in the conference in 1987.http://static.psacsports.org/custompages/mbball/MBB%20All- PSAC%20History.pdf In 1988, Kanaskie became head coach at Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), another PSAC school. In eight seasons at IUP, Kanaskie had a 152–75 record after inheriting a program with four straight losing seasons. Kanaskie led IUP to its first-ever NCAA Tournament in 1994 and earned two more West Division PSAC Coach of the Year honors in 1994 and 1995. Kanaskie moved up to the Division I level as head coach at Drake University, a position he held from 1996 to 2003. When he began the job, Drake was under NCAA probation and had few returning scholarship players. Drake won only five games in Kanaskie's first two seasons but improved to 12–16 (8–10 Missouri Valley Conference) in 2000–01.https://www.sports- reference.com/cbb/coaches/kurt-kanaskie-1.html Kanaskie received a five-year contract extension after that season but still did not deliver a winning season. Days after the 2002–03 season, both Kanaskie's lawyer and the Drake athletic director indicated that Kanaskie would keep his job. However, Kanaskie resigned on April 11, 2003, ending his tenure at Drake with an overall 62–136 record. Kanaskie returned to being an assistant coach in 2003 at Penn State under Ed DeChellis. In 2009, DeChellis promoted Kanaskie to associate head coach. When DeChellis became head coach at Navy in 2011, Kanaskie followed and also became associate head coach. After one year at Navy, Kanaskie became assistant coach at Virginia Tech under James Johnson in 2012. Johnson was fired after two seasons. Kanaskie moved to Air Force as assistant coach under Dave Pilipovich in 2014.

Con il toponimo generico qal‘a (‘cittadella’, ‘fortezza’) abbiamo per esempio Calatafimi, Calatamauro (ovvero ‘la rocca del Moro’), Calatrasi (‘la rocca del tessitore’), Caltabellotta (‘la rocca delle querce’).

Qalats can be quickly constructed over the course of a single season, and they can be extremely large, sometimes covering several acres. Towers may be placed at the corners or points along the walls to create a more defensible position, but most qala compounds consist only of the walls. While the foundation of a qala compound may be stone or fired brick, the walls are typically dried mud. Walls are created by laying down a row of adobe bricks with mud mortar along the entire length of the wall. By the time that the mason returns to the point of origin, the mortar is dry and the next row can be added on top of the old. Using this technique walls dozens of feet high can be built very rapidly.

History With the construction of I-15 around Parowan imminent, SR-1 was moved from old US-91 to the proposed bypass in 1968. SR-143, which had ended at SR-1 (Main Street) in Parowan, was extended north on Main Street and a planned connection to I-15 at exit 78.Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated November 2007, accessed May 2008 However, plans had changed by the time I-15 was completed in 1975, and a second interchange (exit 75) served the west side of Parowan. SR-143 was instead rerouted south and west to meet I-15 there, and what had become part of SR-143 in 1968 was instead redesignated SR-274.Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated December 2007, accessed May 2008 Major intersections References 274 Utah State Route 274 274 Category:Streets in Utah ","title":"Utah State Route 274"},{"id":"16721808","text":"Johann or Johannes Bach (26 November 1604 – buried 13 May 1673) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque.

By providing this space, laboratory and hospital rooms may be easily rearranged throughout their lifecycles and therefore reduce lifecycle cost. Description An interstitial space is useful when the mechanical system of the building is highly sophisticated and changing the space on the primary floors is a distinct possibility. The heights of these spaces are generally six to eight feet and allow easy access for repair or alteration.Hospital and Healthcare Facility Design: 2nd Edition. Richard L. Miller and Earl S. Swensson. W W Norton & Co Inc., 2002, pp. 51-52 If changes or maintenance need to be performed in the interstitial space, the primary space does not need to be shut down, which is important in buildings like hospitals where the equipment in the space must operate constantly. Unlike traditionally built buildings, where the mechanical space is located in the basement or on the top floor, the interstitial space needs few vertical penetrations and therefore leaves more open space on the primary floor. The entire floor plan of these buildings can be more open because there are fewer fixed vertical penetrations through the floor and walls. Another way to use an interstitial space is to incorporate a design that divides the functions of the building into groups and localizes them. The Zeidler Partnership Architects’ (ZPA) design of the William Osler Health Centre (WOHC) in Brampton, Ontario, is one example of this design. (Note: this was designed but ZPA was not awarded the project.) The groups in this design are based on similar structural and mechanical systems. Flexible design allows for easy expansion or redesign in the future. Horizontal expansion is especially easy because of the interstitial space between the surgical suite and the emergency floors, where the mechanical system functions are the most crucial in this building. Double floor height is used to maintain the horizontal flow of connections throughout the rest of the building without causing any interference with other building systems. History The idea of using an interstitial space was started in the 1960s by professors at Texas A&M; University’s College of Architecture. Their concept was to standardize spaces and allow for rapid changes in medical facilities. While the spaces for building systems like plumbing, mechanical, and electrical systems were not as large as today’s, it was an important beginning of an idea to separate the systems by floor. The first building to actually use an interstitial space design was Louis Kahn’s Salk Institute of Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. The design allowed the building to keep up with ever-changing technology.David J. Fine and Stephen Vanderber. Healthcare In An Era Of Radical Transformation. Yale University Press, 2000, pp. 116-117 From there, designs progressed to concepts created by ZPA; a firm who has completed over 40 healthcare and lab facilities for buildings using an interstitial space design.Planning for Change: Hospital Design Theories in Practice (http://www.aia.org/nwsltr_print.cfm?pagename=aah_jrnl_20051019_change). Retrieved on 2008-03-06 Today, many firms have drawn inspiration from ZPA and use their concept to develop their own design. Some designs cover the whole floor area and some, like the WOHC, are partial interstitial spaces. Pros and cons of using an interstitial space =Pros= Interstitial spaces are exceedingly useful when a building needs to be re-modeled. In a medical or lab facility, technology improves incredibly fast and no one can predict what equipment buildings will need to be designed for in the future. With an interstitial space, room layouts in the primary floor may be altered much more easily than traditionally designed buildings since there are fewer service stacks penetrating the floors. The walls can be arranged and rearranged freely. If a drastic renovation must occur, only one floor at a time has to be shut down for renovation, instead of the whole building. The cost of the building is reduced significantly since major equipment does not have to be changed during a renovation. Lifecycle cost includes anything that pertains to the building from when it is in its schematic design phase until it is demolished. A chart of the cost distribution is shown in figure 2. If the equipment itself must be retrofitted, it can be done faster, since the spaces have ample area to work and are separated by floor. The lifetime of the building may also be increased, since the adaptable spaces may be retrofitted instead of needing to be torn down for a redesigned building. Figure 2. Lifecycle building cost pie chart. Separating the building systems from the primary space can also be helpful during construction. If sequenced correctly, it can decrease the installation time of major equipment significantly. Each trade may work on one floor and move to the next after another is finished. Also, wall, ceiling, and floor finishes may be worked on while the building systems are installed as opposed to a traditionally designed building where they would have to wait for more equipment to be installed. Another advantage of using an interstitial space is that easy access to the equipment in them may encourage preventative maintenance. If a more efficient system can be installed easily, it can again reduce lifecycle cost. =Cons= The largest and most well known negative of interstitial spaces is a high first cost.David R. Riley and Sandra Vondrak. Interstitial Space Design In Modern Laboratories. Journal of Architectural Engineering, Vol. 11, No. 2, June 2005, pp. 60-70 Adding more floors increases the amount of material used for floor decks, walls, etc. The construction expense becomes much larger when anything is added because it affects many other systems in the building. One main thing that increases is the amount of façade material necessary to cover the skin of the building. Depending on that material, the cost and time of construction could be largely inflated. Equipment costs can become a large deterrent of owners also. Several smaller pieces of equipment must be purchased for each floor instead of one large piece for the whole building. The large piece of equipment is much cheaper than all of the small pieces combined in almost every case.

He has also appeared in other media from the Reborn! franchise including video games and light novels. Ryohei is portrayed as one of the series' protagonists, and is introduced as the energetic member of the boxing club at Namimori Middle School. He would often attempt to get the main character, Tsuna Sawada, to join his club, and in response, Tsuna's home tutor, Reborn, attempts to get him to join Tsuna's personal Mafia family. His role is initially minimal, usually only having brief appearances since his introduction. Becoming the Vongola Family's Sun Guardian is what leads to his first significant and recurring involvement in the story. Character outline =Personality= Ryohei is the older brother of the Tsuna's love interest, Kyoko. He is a boxing-obsessed student who often prefers to fight his opponents head on and sees any disadvantage as a chance to improve his fighting skills. He is always hiding the truth of what he is doing from Kyoko due to an incident that happened when they were still in primary school: some high school students who did not like Ryohei used Kyoko to lure him into a trap, which resulted in the scar on his left temple. Though Kyoko feels responsible, he was not dissuaded and continued to fight. Every time he sees Tsuna and his friends doing something strange, he gets fired up and always wants to be a part of it, though appears to be unaware that it is Mafia- related. Due to Ryohei's enthusiasm, he often rushes into things without fully evaluating the situation, which often ends in his humiliation. He can get flustered at times, however, as shown when he sees a picture of his adult self and Hana Kurokawa together in the future. He also has a short memory and forgets many important details, something his adult self solved by writing memo's. He often uses the word \\"extreme\\". =Abilities= Ryohei is an excellent boxer who possesses greater strength than the average human. His boxing training resulted in his proficiency in hand-to-hand combat, and ability to take and give a huge amount of physical punishment. Even the Dying Will Shot, which increases a person's strength by removing the body's limiters, has no effect on him since he always lives \\"to the extreme.\\" His body's potential strength is exemplified during his training with the Arcobaleno Colonnello, who told him that his naturally strong muscles and his superior cells are at its best after his body is rested, thus Ryohei only uses his left fist in order to keep his right in perfect condition. Colonnello also shoots him with a spiritually condensed bullet to unlock his potential, which enables him to unleash \\"Maximum Cannon\\", a blow strong enough to break boulders. In the future, Ryohei has greatly improved in his abilities, learning Lussuria's footwork techniques to move at great speed,家庭教師ヒットマンREBORN！ manga chapter 187. and using it to upgrade his Maximum Cannon into \\"Maximum Ingram\\", which deals multiple blows. His Sun Dying Will Flame, which contains \\"activation\\" characteristics, can increase the rate of recovery in his own skin cells, and can also be used to overload other box weapons. He also carries a special box that releases a kangaroo named , but only uses it for support since he relies on his own strength. The kangaroo generates boxing gloves that multiply his healing capabilities,家庭教師ヒットマンREBORN！ manga chapter 186. and a pair of boots that grants him the ability to fly.家庭教師ヒットマンREBORN！ manga chapter 188. When young Ryohei replaces his older self, he is given the Sun Vongola Box Weapon, The Knuckle of Maximum Break, which hyper activates his nerves and muscles making him much stronger and faster. However, this power is overwhelming on his body so he can only use it for three minutes.家庭教師ヒットマンREBORN！ manga chapter 269 When his Vongola Ring is destroyed by the Shimon family, it is replaced with the Vongola Bangle which, in its Cambio Forma mode, removes the three-minute time limit and also converts damage received from enemies into flame energy which can be used in a powerful attack.家庭教師ヒットマンREBORN！ manga chapter 305 Appearances =In Reborn!= Adult Ryohei as depicted in the future. In the initial parts of the story, Ryohei plays a small role, randomly appearing only a few times to take part in what are usually Reborn's schemes. When the Kokuyo Gang later appears in Namimori Town, Ryohei is targeted due to his status as Namimori High's fifth strongest student, and loses a fight against Ken Joshima, resulting in his loss of five teeth as well as being temporarily hospitalized. Ryohei is later entrusted with the Vongola's Ring of the Sun and is trained by Colonnello. Despite facing major disadvantages, he defeats Lussuria in the Vongola Tournament's first match against the Varia. During the final battle, in which the fighters are injected with poison, Hayato Gokudera cures Ryohei, who goes on to cure Lussuria despite their differing allegiance. He later saves Takeshi Yamamoto, Chrome Dokuro, and Gokudera from Mammon's illusions. In the series' alternate future story arc, after returning from meeting with the Varia in Italy,家庭教師ヒットマンREBORN！ manga chapter 166. adult Ryohei finds and delivers the past's Chrome to the Vongola base at Namimori, along with the information he retrieved concerning the Vongola's plan to attack the Millefiore Family. During their siege of the enemy's Japanese base, he encounters and defeats Millefiore member Baishana.家庭教師ヒットマンREBORN！ manga chapter 189. After Ryohei and Gokudera get separated from the others due to the base's rooms being rearranged, they encounter Gamma, whom subsequently defeats Ryohei in battle. Ryohei, however, is able to protect Gokudera from Gamma's attack with the last of his strength,家庭教師ヒットマンREBORN！ manga chapter 191. and his Kangaryū's abilities helps Gokudera gain the upper-hand against Gamma.家庭教師ヒットマンREBORN！ manga chapter 194. When his past self appears, the Vongola Rings are united, protecting the others from being teleported away with the base.家庭教師ヒットマンREBORN！ manga chapter 228. After being explained the situation, only to comprehend who is the main bad guy, Ryohei undergoes training on how to use the weapons of that era. In the battle against the Six Funeral Wreaths, Ryohei is wounded while protecting Uni.家庭教師ヒットマンREBORN！ manga chapter 262. However, he still takes part in the final battle against the Millfiore later on.家庭教師ヒットマンREBORN！ manga chapter 269. In the Inheritance Arc, he is one of the guardians who go to see Tsuna officially become Vongola the 10th. His Vongola Sun ring is destroyed by the Shimon Family as revenge for Primo's betrayal of their first boss. Afterwards, the Vongola Sun Ring is upgraded to Vongola Gear: Bangle of the Sun, Version X. He accompanies Tsuna, Gokudera and Lambo to Shimon's hideout where he faces Koyo Aoba in a boxing fight where he demonstrates his Bangle's power. The match ends in a tie and both he and Koyo are imprisoned by Vindice. He is later released after Daemon Spade's defeat due to a contract made between Tsuna and the Vindice. =In other media= Besides his appearances in the original manga series and its anime adaptation, Ryohei has appeared in various other Reborn! works, including several of the series' video games. He also stars in one of the Hidden Bullet light novels called Extreme Memories, which is set before he met Tsuna. The chapter shows how Ryohei and Hibari first met and why he has never asked Hibari to join the boxing club. Reception Ryohei has generally ranked lower than the other main characters in every official Shonen Jump character popularity poll of the series, not even placing in the first two polls. In the third poll of the series, he ranked as the fourteenth most popular male character. In the fourth poll, he only ranked as the eighteenth most popular overall character.

In the Imperial Russian Army, a military district (, voyenny okrug) was a territorial association of military units, formations, military schools, and various local military establishments. This territorial division type was utilized to provide a more efficient management of army units, their training and other operations activities related to combat readiness. History In the Imperial Russian Army, military districts were first formed by Dmitry Milyutin in 1862–64 to replace the pre-existing Military Inspectorates. The military districts were organised to include civilian administration regions of gubernyas and uyezds. By 1892 there were 13 Military Districts in the Russian Empire, and one region with the status of a military district: # Petersburg Military District () – Saint Petersburg, Olonets, Arkhangelsk, Novgorod, Pskov, Estonia and four uyezds of the Livonia gubernya (Pernov, Fellinskiy, Valkskiy and Verrosskiy) # Vilno Military District () – Vilno, Grodno, Kovno, Kurland, Livonia (without above mentioned four uyezds), Vitebsk, Mogilev, Minsk and Suwałki (without the Shchuchinsk uyezd) # Warsaw Military District () – Congress Poland without the part of Suwałki in Vilno Military District # Kiev Military District () – Kiev, Podolia, Volhynia, Chernigov, Poltava, Kharkov, Kursk # Odessa Military District () – Bessarabia, Kherson, Yekaterinoslav, Taurida # Moscow Military District () – Moscow, Smolensk, Tver, Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Vologda, Vladimir, Nizhniy-Novgorod, Kaluga, Tula, Ryazan, Orel, Tambov, Voronezh # Kazan Military District () – Kazan, Vyatka, Perm, Ufa, Simbirsk, Samara, Penza, Saratov, Astrakhan (with the Astrakhan, Ural and Orenburg Cossack host troops) # Caucasus Military District () – Stavropol gubernya with the entire Caucasus and Transcaucasia (including the Kuban and Terek Cossack host troops) # Turkestan Military District () – the region (область): Syr-Darya (with the Amu Dar'ya subdivision), Samarkand and Fergana # Omsk Military District () – Tobolsk and Tomsk guberniyas, the Akmolinsk, Semipalatinsk and Semirechye regions (with the local Cossack troops). # Irkutsk Military District () – Irkutsk and Yeniseysk Governorates and the Yakutsk region (with the local Cossack troops). # Amur Military District () – regions of Transbaikal, Amur (with the local Cossack troops), Pacific coast region and the Sakhalin island # Don Host Oblast, In the Donskoy military district the right and responsibility of the Commander of forces and Governor-Generalship were entrusted to the appointed ataman; control of the military district consisted of Don Cossack host staff and administration.

Stimson (born May 15, 1957) is the founder, pastor and executive director of The Special Gathering, a Christian ministry within the mentally challenged community. The mission of Special Gathering is to \\"evangelize and disciple\\" this subculture made up of people who are developmentally delayed.Meacham, Pat. \\"The Special Gathering,\\" Special Education Today, Winter 2007-08, pg 12,13. An ordained Assemblies of God minister, \\"Stimson conceived the idea for the ministry when he was in college and teaching a Sunday school class of mentally handicapped students in Lakeland, Florida.\\"Kreig, Peg. \\"People With Mental Handicaps Make Up a Special Church,\\" Presbyterian Survey, 1986 October. In 1982 after his graduation from Southeastern University (Florida), The Special Gathering of Cocoa, Florida was formed. The ministry has grown to eight programs in two states. The Special Gathering, Inc., is the umbrella organization. Coming under this ministry are The Special Gathering of Brevard, The Special Gathering of Indian River, The Special Gathering of South Carolina, The Special Gathering of Volusia, and The Special Gathering of Jacksonville.  Community-based model of ministry  A proponent of the specialized model of ministry for individuals who are intellectually disabled, Stimson teaches that \\"community-based ministry is the most effective vehicle to use in spreading\\" the good news of Christianity to this sub- culture.Stimson, Richard. \\"How Will We Minister?\\" Networks for Those With Specialized Ministry; 1991, January. Doing classic ministry, the heart of each Special Gathering is the chapel services which are conducted on a regular basis. Stimson writes, \\"God has ordained the local church to spread the good news of Christianity.\\" Stimson, Richard. \\"Exploitation is Not Necessary,\\" Networks for Those With Specialized Ministry; 1994, April. Therefore, The Special Gathering in each geographic area remains subordinate to the local congregations. Daniel W. Burgess reported in Pentecostal Evangel, March 1987 issue, \\"The Special Gathering's intent is to lovingly nurture the spiritual life of each person.\\" Burgess, Daniel W. \\"A Special Church for a Special People,\\" Pentecostal Evangel, 1987 15 March, pp 8-10.  Advocacy  An avid advocate (Proverbs 31:8-9) for the rights of the people who are intellectually disabled, Stimson understands that the State and Federal governments are actively involved in the lives of his members. For this reason, it is important to serve as a watchdog and activist protecting the rights of vulnerable members of our society. It is Stimson's view that a pastor must be like a shepherd. Shepherds protect their sheep and that advocacy is part of pastoral care.  Controversies  While some applaud the work he had done, Stimson has drawn controversial fire from other respected ministers within the disability community. Thomas B. Hoeksema, PhD, of Calvin College wrote, \\"We cannot always cave into the alleged social need to congregate. Persons with developmental disabilities are necessary to the integrated, normalized family of God. Without them, the Body of Christ is disabled (and) denied the diversity of gifts which people with retardation bring. Total segregation is not good for those with or without disabilities.\\"Fleming, Bill. \\"Called to an Invisible Society,\\" Christianity Today, 1996. Brett Webb-Mitchell, PhD, used Stimson's model of ministry as an example of what should not be done in ministry for individuals who are intellectually disabled. In his article published in the 1994 issue of the Journal of Religion in Disability & Rehabilitation. Webb-Mitchell wrote, \\"A Florida pastor has formed congregations for only people with mental retardation and some of these have existed for more than 10 years. He has taken those with mental retardation out of the worship of 'normal congregations.' They now gather together in rented halls on Sunday mornings for their own church, called 'A Special Gathering.' Why? Because he thought putting persons with mental retardation into worship would be like placing them in a high school algebra class. For this pastor, worship is merely a thing of the mind.\\"Webb-Mitchell, Brett, PhD. \\"The De- instutitionalization of Specialized Ministries: The Importance of the Church Being the Church\\" Journal of Religion of Disability and Rehabilitation, Vol.1(1) 1994, pg 49, Haworth Press, Inc.  Author and publisher  Stimson has been published in the Mental Retardation, a Journal of Policy, Practices, and Perspective, published by the American Association on Mental Retardation, and The Journal of Religion, Disability and Health published by Haworth Press. Articles about The Special Gathering have appeared in Christianity Today, Pentecostal Evangel, Charisma, and many other magazines. Stimson served as publisher of the quarterly journal, Networks, published by The Special Gathering from 1991 to 1994.  Education  Stimson has a BA from Southeastern University and a Masters from the Moody Bible Institute.

Like all lemurs, they are native to Madagascar, where they are found only in the west, north, and east sides of the island. They are named for the two black stripes which run up from the eyes, converge on the top of the head, and run down the back as a single black stripe. They were originally placed in the genus Lemur in 1839, later moved between the genera Cheirogaleus and Microcebus, and given their own genus in 1870 by John Edward Gray. Only one species (Phaner furcifer) was recognized, until three subspecies described in 1991 were promoted to species status in 2001. New species may yet be identified, particularly in northeast Madagascar. Fork-marked lemurs are among the least studied of all lemurs and are some of the largest members of the family Cheirogaleidae, weighing around or more. They are the most phylogenetically distinct of the cheirogaleids, and considered a sister group to the rest of the family. Aside from their dorsal forked stripe, they have dark rings around their eyes, and large membranous ears. Males have a scent gland on their throat, but only use it during social grooming, not for marking territory. Instead, they are very vocal, making repeated calls at the beginning and end of the night. Like the other members of their family, they are nocturnal, and sleep in tree holes and nests during the day. Monogamous pairing is typical for fork-marked lemurs, and females are dominant. Females are thought to have only one offspring every two years or more. These species live in a wide variety of habitats, ranging from dry deciduous forests to rainforests, and run quadrupedally across branches. Their diet consists primarily of tree gum and other exudates, though they may obtain some of their protein and nitrogen by hunting small arthropods later at night. Three of the four species are endangered and the other is listed as vulnerable. Their populations are in decline due to habitat destruction. Like all lemurs, they are protected against commercial trade under CITES Appendix I. Taxonomy In 1897, Alfred Grandidier demonstrated the similarities between Lepilemur (middle column, bottom two) and the cheirogaleids, particularly Phaner (middle, top). Fork-marked lemurs were first documented in 1839 by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville when he described the Masoala fork- marked lemur (P. furcifer) as Lemur furcifer. The holotype is thought to be MNHN 1834-136, a female specimen taken from Madagascar by French naturalist Jules Goudot. The source of this specimen is unknown, but thought to be Antongil Bay. In 1850, Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire moved the fork-marked lemurs to the genus Cheirogaleus (dwarf lemurs), but they were also commonly listed in the genus Microcebus (mouse lemurs). In 1870, John Edward Gray assigned fork-marked lemurs to their own genus, Phaner, after initially including them and the mouse lemurs in the genus Lepilemur (sportive lemurs). Although French naturalist Alfred Grandidier accepted Gray's new genus (while also lumping the other cheirogaleids in Cheirogaleus and illustrating the cranial similarities between cheirogaleids and Lepilemur) in 1897, the genus Phaner was not widely accepted. In the early 1930s, Ernst Schwarz, Guillaume Grandidier, and others resurrected the name, citing characteristics that were intermediate between Cheirogaleus and Microcebus. Until the late 20th century, there was only one recognized species of fork-marked lemur, although size and coloration differences had been noted previously. After comparing museum specimens, paleoanthropologist Ian Tattersall and physical anthropologist Colin Groves recognized three new subspecies in 1991: the Pale fork-marked lemur (P. f. pallescens), Pariente's fork-marked lemur (P. f. parienti), and the Amber Mountain fork-marked lemur (P. f. electromontis). In 2001, Groves elevated all four subspecies to species status based on noticeable color, size, and body proportion differences between the fragmented populations. Although Tattersall disagreed with this promotion, citing inadequate information for the decision, the arrangement is generally accepted. In December 2010, Russell Mittermeier of Conservation International and conservation geneticist Edward E. Louis, Jr. announced the possibility of a new species of fork-marked lemur in the protected area of Daraina in northeast Madagascar. In October, a specimen was observed, captured, and released, although genetic tests have yet to determine if it is a new species. The specimen demonstrated a slightly different color pattern from other fork- marked lemur species. If shown to be a new species, they plan to name it after Fanamby, a key conservation organization working in that protected forest. =Etymology= The etymology of the genus Phaner puzzled researchers for many years. Gray often created mysterious and unexplained taxonomic names. In 1904, Theodore Sherman Palmer attempted to document the etymologies of all mammalian taxa, but could not definitively explain the origins of the generic name Phaner, noting only that it derived from the Greek φανερός (phaneros) meaning \\"visible, evident\\". In 2012, Alex Dunkel, Jelle Zijlstra, and Groves attempted to solve the mystery. Following some initial speculation, a search of the general literature published around 1870 revealed the source: the British comedy The Palace of Truth by W. S. Gilbert, which premiered in London on 19 November 1870, nearly one and a half weeks prior to the date written on the preface of Gray's manuscript (also published in London). The comedy featured characters bearing three names: King Phanor (sic), Mirza, and Azema. Since the genera Mirza (giant mouse lemurs) and Azema (for M. rufus, now a synonym for Microcebus) were both described in the same publication and equally enigmatic, the authors concluded that Gray had seen the comedy and then based the names of three lemur genera on its characters. Fork-marked lemurs were called \\"fork- marked dwarf lemurs\\" by Henry Ogg Forbes in 1894 and \\"fork-crowned mouse lemur\\" by English missionary and naturalist James Sibree in 1895. Literature searches by Dunkel et al. also uncovered other names, such as \\"fork-lined lemur\\" and \\"squirrel lemur\\", during the early 1900s. By the 1970s, reference to dwarf and mouse lemurs had ended, and the \\"fork-crowned\\" prefix became popular between 1960 and 2001. Since then, the \\"fork-marked\\" prefix has become more widely used. These lemurs get their common name from the distinctive forked stripe on their head. =Evolution= Within the family Cheirogaleidae, fork-marked lemurs are the most phylogenetically distinct, although their placement remained uncertain until recently. One uniting characteristic (synapomorphy) among all cheirogaleids, to the exclusion of other lemurs, is the branching of the carotid artery along with how it enters the skull—a trait which is shared by fork-marked lemurs. Analyses based on morphology, immunology, and repetitive DNA have given contradictory placements of Phaner, while studies in 2001 and 2008 either lacked data or yielded poor resolution of their placement. A study in 2009 of seven mitochondrial genes (mtDNA) and three nuclear genes grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs (family Lepilemuridae), offering a host of explanations, such as a possible hybridization (introgression) following the initial split between the families. A study published in 2013 also grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs when it used 43 morphological traits and mtDNA. If correct, this would make the family Cheirogaleidae paraphyletic. Broad agreement between two lemur phylogeny studies—one in 2004 using SINE analysis and another in 2012 using multilocus phylogenetic tests—gave strong support for a sister group relationship between fork-marked lemurs and the rest of the cheirogaleids and a more distant relationship with sportive lemurs. The split between Phaner and the rest of the cheirogaleids is thought to have occurred approximately 38 mya (million years ago), not long after the radiation of most of the major lemur groups on Madagascar, roughly 43 mya. Description P. furcifer, first described in 1839, was illustrated in Brehms Tierleben. Of the mostly small, nocturnal lemurs in family Cheirogaleidae, the genus Phaner contains some of the largest species, along with Cheirogaleus. Their body weight ranges between , and their head-body length averages between , with a tail length between . Fork-marked lemurs' dorsal (back) fur is either light brown or light grayish-brown, while their ventral (underside) fur can be yellow, cream, white, or pale brown. A black stripe extends from the tail, along the dorsal midline to the head, where it forks at the top of the head in a distinguishing Y-shape leading to the dark rings around both eyes, and sometimes extends down the snout. The dorsal stripe varies in width and darkness. The base of the tail is the same color as the dorsal fur and is usually tipped in black; the tail is bushy. The lemurs' ears are relatively large and membranous. Males have a scent gland on the middle of their throat, which is approximately wide and pink in color. Females have a narrow, bare patch of white skin in the same location, but theirs does not appear to produce secretions. Fork-marked lemurs are distinguished by the dorsal black stripe that forks on the crown of their head. These lemurs have relatively long hindlegs. For gripping tree trunks and large branches, they have large hands and feet with extended pads on the digits, as well as claw-like nails. They have a long tongue which assists obtaining the gum and nectar, as well as a long caecum, which helps digest gums. Their procumbent (forward-facing) lemuriform toothcomb (formed by the lower incisors and canines) is long and more compressed, with significantly reduced interdental spaces to minimize the accumulation of gum between the teeth. The genus is distinguished from other cheirogaleids by the toothrows on its maxilla (upper jaw), which are parallel and do not converge towards the front of the mouth. The fork-marked lemur dental formula is ; on each side of the mouth, top and bottom, there are two incisors, one canine, three premolars, and three molars—a total of 36 teeth. Their upper first incisor (I1) is long and curved towards the middle of the mouth (unique among lemurs), while the second upper incisor (I2) is small with a gap (diastema) between the two. The upper canines are large, with their tips curved. Their upper anterior premolars (P2) are caniniform (canine-shaped) and more pronounced than in any other living lemur. The next upper premolar (P3) is very small, with a single, pointed cusp that contacts the lingual cingulum (a crest or ridge on the tongue side), which circles the base of the tooth. The two cusps on the last upper premolar (P4) are a large paracone and a smaller protocone. Like other cheirogaleids, their first lower premolar (P2) is caniniform and large, while the cingulids (ridges) on the three lower premolars are more developed compared to most other cheirogaleids. The first two upper molars (M1–2) have a developed hypocone, and the buccal cingulum (a crest or ridge on the cheek side) is well developed on all three upper molars. The molars are relatively small compared to other cheirogaleids, with the second upper and lower molars (M2 and M2) having reduced functionality compared to those of mouse lemurs. Males have relatively small testes compared to other lemurs, and their canine teeth are the same size as those seen in females. During the dry season, females can weigh more than males. Both patterns of sexual dimorphism are consistent with the theory of sexual selection for monogamous species and female dominance respectively. Females have two pairs of nipples. Distribution and habitat Fork-marked lemurs are found in the west, north, and east of Madagascar, but their distribution is discontinuous. Their habitat ranges from dry deciduous forests on the western coast of the island to rainforest in the east. They are also commonly found in secondary forest, but not in areas lacking continuous forest cover. They are most common in the west of the island. Fork-marked lemurs are not found in the southern spiny forests in the dry southern part of the island, and only recently have been reported from the southeastern rainforest at Andohahela National Park, though this has not been confirmed. A team led by E. E. Louis Jr. has suggested that undescribed varieties may also exist elsewhere on the island. The Masoala fork-marked lemur is found on the Masoala Peninsula in the northeast of the island, while the Amber Mountain fork-marked lemur is located in the far north of the island, particularly at Amber Mountain National Park. Pariente's fork-marked lemur is found in the Sambirano region in the northwest, and the pale fork-marked lemur is in the west of the island. Behavior Males, such as this P. pallescens, have a scent gland of their throat, which they only use during social grooming. Fork-marked lemurs are among the least studied of all lemurs, and little is known about them. Only the pale fork-marked lemur (P. pallescens) has been studied relatively well, primarily by Pierre Charles-Dominique, Jean-Jacques Petter, and Georges Pariente during two expeditions in the 1970s and a more extensive 1998 study in Kirindy Forest. Like the other cheirogaleids, these lemurs are nocturnal, sleeping in tree hollows (typically in large baobab trees) or abandoned nests built by giant mouse lemurs (Mirza coquereli) during the day. Some of the abandoned nests they sleep in are leaf-lined, and fresh leaves are often added when young are born. As many as 30 sleeping sites may be used over the course of a year, each for a variable length of time. At night, fork-marked lemurs visit the feeding sites within their range by running quadrupedally across branches at high speed over long distances, leaping from tree to tree without pausing. They have been seen on the ground (typically during chases following fights) and as high as , but they are typically seen running along branches at a height of . While running, they can leap horizontally between tree branches without losing height or as much as while falling a short distance. Fork- marked lemurs are sensitive to light intensity, and emerge at twilight, calling numerous times and answering their neighbors' calls before going off to forage. Just before dawn, they also communicate again on their way to their sleep site. Cold temperatures can also cause individuals to retire to their sleeping site as early as two hours before dawn. Their eye shine creates a unique pattern among lemurs because they tend to bob their heads up and down and from side to side. These lemurs are territorial, with territory size dependent upon food availability, though territories typically cover . Because of their fast movement, individuals can easily defend their territories by traversing it within 5 minutes. Territory overlap is minimal between males, and the same pattern is seen in females, though males and females may overlap their territories. In areas where territory overlap occurs (\\"meeting areas\\"), several neighbors may gather and vocalize together without aggression. Multiple family groups may gather in these meeting areas, and females will often socialize with the other females and young. Unlike other lemurs, fork- marked lemurs do not scent-mark, and instead use vocalizations during territorial confrontations. They are considered very vocal animals, and have a complex range of calls. On average, males make approximately 30 loud calls per hour, and are most vocal at dusk and dawn. Their high-pitched, whistling calls help researchers identify them in the field. As well as their stress call and fighting call, they emit a Hon call (contact call between male-female pairs), Ki and Kiu calls (more excited contact calls that identify the caller), and a Kea call (a loud call shared between males in adjacent territories). Females also make a \\"bleating\\" call when they have infants. Males and females have been seen sleeping and foraging together as monogamous pairs, although polygamy and solitary behavior has also been observed. At Kirindy Forest, pairs were observed staying together for multiple seasons, though they were only seen foraging alone, with most interactions resulting from conflicts over feeding sites. Nest sharing among pairs occurs one out of every three days. During social grooming (allogrooming), the male allomarks females using a scent gland on the throat, and grooming sessions can last several minutes. While feeding, females appear to be dominant, gaining first access to food. Females are also dominant over non-resident males, indicating true female dominance, comparable to that seen in the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta). Mating has been observed to take place at the end of the dry season, in early November, and births were inferred between late February and early March. Only one infant is born per season, despite females having two pairs of nipples. Infants are initially parked in unguarded tree holes while the mother forages. Older infants have not been observed clinging to the mother, and as they get older, they are parked in vegetation until they can move independently. Females produce milk for two years following the birth of the young. The offspring may remain under the care of their parents for three years or more, and there is no information about their dispersal at maturity. Females have not been observed giving birth in consecutive years. Ecology These lemurs have a specialized diet of tree gums and sap. Their diet consists mainly of gum from trees in the genus Terminalia (known locally as \\"Talinala\\"), which are often parasitized by beetle larvae that burrow beneath the bark. Fork- marked lemurs either consume the gum as it seeps from cracks in the bark of parasitized trees or gouge open the bark with their toothcomb to scoop it up directly with their long tongue. Between March and May, gums compose the majority of the diet. They have also been documented eating gums from Commiphora species and Colvillea racemosa, bud exudates from Zanthoxylum tsihanimposa, sap from baobab trees (Adansonia species), nectar from Crateva greveana flowers, the sugary excretions from bugs (family Machaerotidae) which feed on trees of the genus Rhopalocarpus, and very small amounts of fruit. Although fork-marked lemurs have widely varied forest habitat, gum and other plant exudates of other species are likely to dominate their diet. They are not known to estivate or accumulate fat reserves for the dry season. The Madagascar harrier-hawk may prey on fork-marked lemurs by extracting them from their sleeping holes. To meet their protein requirements and obtain nitrogen, these lemurs also hunt small arthropods. In captivity, P. furcifer strongly favored preying mantises and moths of the family Sphingidae while ignoring grasshoppers, larva of the moth genus Coeloptera, and small reptiles. Hunting usually occurs later at night, following gum collection, and typically happens in the canopy or on tree trunks. Insects are captured by rapidly grasping them with the hands, a stereotypic behavior seen in other members of their family, as well as galagos. The exudates of several tree species they are known to feed on are high in protein, so some fork-marked lemurs may meet their protein requirements without preying on insects. Other nocturnal lemurs are sympatric with fork-marked lemurs. In western Madagascar, interspecific competition is reduced by restricting activity to specific levels of the canopy, such as using only the highest sleeping sites at least above the ground. Competition with other cheirogaleids, such as the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) and Coquerel's giant mouse lemur (Mirza coquereli), is most intense for Terminalia gum during the dry season, but fork-marked lemurs always drive the other lemur species off. Studies of P. pallescens at Kirindy Forest found up to a 20% drop in body mass during the dry season despite no changes in exudate production, indicating flowers and insects have a significant impact on the species' health. Fork-marked lemurs are thought to be preyed upon by large owls, such as the Madagascar owl (Asio madagascariensis), and snakes like the Malagasy tree boa (Sanzinia madagascariensis). In one case, a family of fork- marked lemurs exhibited mobbing behavior when they encountered a Malagasy tree boa. Diurnal raptors, such as the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) and Madagascar cuckoo-hawk (Aviceda madagascariensis) hunt these lemurs at dusk, and the hunting behavior of the Madagascar harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) suggests it might extract them from their sleeping holes. The fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) has also been seen attacking fork-marked lemurs, and remains have been found in their scat. Conservation In 2012, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) listed P. parienti, P. electromontis, and P. pallescens as endangered, and P. furcifer as vulnerable. Before this assessment, it was assumed that their population was in decline due to habitat destruction for the creation of pasture and agriculture. Measures of their population density vary widely, from 50 to 550 individuals per square kilometer (250 acres), but these numbers are thought to reflect only small, gum-rich areas, and therefore only small, clustered populations with an overall low population density. As with all lemurs, fork-marked lemurs were first protected in 1969 when they were listed as \\"Class A\\" of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. This prohibited hunting and capture without authorization, which would only be given for scientific purposes or the national interest. They were also protected under CITES Appendix I as of 1973. This strictly regulates their trade and forbids commercial trade. Although enforcement is patchy, they are also protected under Malagasy law. Fork-marked lemurs are rarely kept in captivity, and their captive lifespan can range from 12 to 25 years.

Broadway Avenue begins at an interchange with Interstate 90 (I-90) and travels northeast through Downtown Moses Lake concurrent to Interstate 90 Business and parallel to Parker Horn before ending at an intersection with SR 17\\\\. Broadway Avenue was previously part of Primary State Highway 18 (PSH 18) and U.S. Route 10 (US 10) until the 1964 highway renumbering. The highway also has an un-built extension from Moses Lake northeast to Odessa that was first legislated in 1955 as Secondary State Highway 7E (SSH 7E). Route description State Route 171 (SR 171) and Interstate 90 Business (I-90 Business) begin their long concurrency as Broadway Avenue at a diamond interchange with Interstate 90 (I-90) in Moses Lake. The street travels north over a branch of the Columbia Basin Railroad into Downtown Moses Lake and turns northeast to parallel the Parker Horn before the split between SR 171 and I-90 Business, which becomes Pioneer Way. The highway continues northeast to leave Downtown Moses Lake and end at an intersection with SR 17, which bypasses the city. Every year the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 3,900 and 21,000 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly in the Yakima area. History Broadway Avenue was originally part of Primary State Highway 18 (PSH 18), which extended from George to Ritzville. PSH 18 was created in 1937 and crossed the western part of Moses Lake into Downtown Moses Lake on a bridge that was built in 1924. U.S. Route 10 (US 10) was re-routed onto PSH 18 in the 1940s, and both highways began using a proposed southern bypass of the city in 1955. A road connecting Moses Lake to Odessa in the northeast was proposed in the late 1940s, and was signed into law in 1955 as Secondary State Highway 7E. Interstate 90 (I-90) replaced US 10 and PSH 18 during the creation of the Interstate Highway System in 1956, and SSH 7E was replaced by State Route 171 (SR 171) in a 1964 renumbering.

Ahmet appended a commentary to the map, outlining his own life and an explanation for the creation of the map. But it is not clear whether Ahmet created the map, or whether he simply translated it into Turkish for use in the Ottoman world. The map Hacı Ahmet appended a lengthy commentary to a 16th-century map of the world annotated in the Turkish language, known as The Ottoman Mappa Mundi of Hacı Ahmet, amongst other titles, which opens with \\"Whoever wishes to know the true shape of the world, their minds shall be filled with light and their breast with joy.\\" The map is heart shaped, otherwise known as a \\"cordiform projection,\\" a style that was popular in sixteenth century Europe, and the extant copy was printed from wooden blocks in Venice, Italy, in 1559. It was kept until the late 18th century in the archives of the Venetian Council of Ten. The map is now part of the Heritage Library in the Qatar National Library. Known as the \\"Mappamondo Hacı Ahmet\\", the map outlines legends and place-names in Turkish, and it may be the first map in Turkish ever published for sale to an Ottoman audience. Whether the map is original, or was simply a translation into Turkish, it helps show how the people of the Ottoman Empire perceived themselves in relation to the wider world. Three small spheres appear below the main map at the bottom of the page - the central graphic represents Earth and a number of satellite planets, while the left and right depict constellations. Within the accompanying text of the map, Hacı Ahmet explains that the map was created to share knowledge of the shape of the world, especially of the New World. Specifically, Ahmet points out that the classical philosophers, such as Plato and Socrates, did not know about the newly discovered continent, which he says shows that the world is round. He says that the New World demonstrates the \\"extent to which the Ottomans were participants in their own right in the process of physical expansion abroad and intellectual ferment at home that characterized the period of history commonly referred to as the Age of Exploration\\". Ahmet also assigns the Ottoman Empire's rulers and kingdoms to the celestial bodies represented in the lower quadrant of the map, a maneuver which has been interpreted as an effort to impose a hierarchical geopolitical system that preferences Ottoman rule above all other world powers.  Authorship  French cartographer Oronce Fine (1494-1555) Heart-Shaped World Map by Oronce Fine (1534) The map is considered unlikely to be original, and was probably translated into Turkish by Ahmet. The map has specific European characteristics, in that it includes the use of Western terms, suggesting Ahmet translated an older map into Turkish. In fact, throughout the map’s accompanying text, Ahmet emphasizes translation, stating that he “translated it from the language and alphabet of the Europeans into that of the Muslims”. A further argument made against Ahmet's authorship is that the “heart-shaped form of the map had already been used by earlier European cartographers”. The map is \\"heart-shaped\\" and is constructed by a cordioform projection developed by 16th century cartographers and mathematicians including Johannes Werner (1468-1522), a German mathematician and geographer. The map has been tentatively linked to several other geographers, including Giovanni Battista Ramusio (1485-1557). It has also been argued that it shares similarities with a map by the French cartographer Orontius (1494-1555), published in 1534.  The Venetian connection  Ahmet claimed the map was made for Ottoman princes, and some of the sons of Suleyman the Magnificent were interested in maps of the world and had looked to Venice for their production. This resulted in the development of Ottoman-Venetian relations, which offered \\"new interpretations of Venetian attitudes to the production of world maps for Ottoman clients\\". The map's printing in Venice helps to highlight aspects of Ottoman-Venetian relations. In the minds of Venetian publishers, it would be “a promising venture to produce a world-map for sale in the Muslim world”, and so the production of world maps was financially rewarding for European publishers. Maps in the Turkish language were in demand by the Ottoman Empire, and maps were translated into Turkish to satisfy that market. The life of Hacı Ahmet Nothing is known of Hacı Ahmet himself, other than his own account of his life recorded in the map text. “I, this poor, wretched and downtrodden Hacı Ahmet of Tunis studied since I was a small child in the Maghrib, in the city of Fez\\", says Ahmet in the text, which briefly describes his origins, saying that he was captured from the infidels and described how, in creating the map, he would regain his liberty. According to the story, Ahmet was educated in Fez, and when a European nobleman purchased him, he was able to continue to practice his Islamic religion.

It was the seat of various fudai daimyō who ruled over Hamamatsu Domain, Tōtōmi Province, in what is now central Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan under the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate. It is also called . Background Hamamatsu is at the edge of Mikatagahara plateau in the center of Tōtōmi Province, and was from ancient times a post station on the Tōkaidō highway connecting Kyoto with the eastern provinces of Japan. During the late Muromachi and Sengoku period, this area came under the control of the Imagawa clan, a powerful warlord from Suruga Province. It is uncertain when the original Hamamatsu Castle was constructed; however, it appears that a fortification was built on what is now the Hamamatsu Tōshō-gū, east of the present castle, by Imagawa Sadatsuke, the fourth head of the Enshū Imagawa clan from around 1504–1520. The early castle was called and was entrusted to Imagawa retainer Iio Noritsura. After the fall of Imagawa Yoshimoto at the 1560 Battle of Okehazama, Iio Tsuratatsu rebelled against Imagawa Ujinao, but was defeated. However, the greatly weakened Imagawa clan was unable to withstand the combined forces for Tokugawa Ieyasu from Mikawa and Takeda Shingen from Kai. The former Imagawa territories in Tōtōmi were divided between the Tokugawa and Takeda in 1568. In December of the same year Tokugawa Ieyasu laid siege to Hikuma Castle and took it from Otazu no kata. He relocated his headquarters from Okazaki Castle to Hamamatsu in 1570, and started construction of a new castle on a site which partially overlapped that of the original Hikuma Castle. Layout Hamamatsu Castle was approximately 500 meters north-south by 450 meters east-west. The location has few natural barriers, but the castle utilizes the natural slope of the Mikatagahara plateau, with the donjon at the highest point in the northwest. To east was the inner bailey, followed by the second bailey and third bailey roughly in a straight line to the southeast. The stone walls were constructed in the nozura-zumi style using unshaped stones, with the ruins of the fortifications of the original Hikuma Castle also forming part of the outer defenses. History Tokugawa Ieyasu spent 17 years at Hamamatsu Castle, from age 29 to 45. The Battle of Anegawa, Battle of Nagashino, and Battle of Komaki and Nagakute were all fought when Hamamatsu was his seat. After his defeated at the Battle of Mikatagahara, Ieyasu forced to retreat here for what he thought would be his final stand. However, the tide later turned for Ieyasu and he survived. He renamed Hikuma Castle \\"Hamamatsu Castle\\" in 1577. Ieyasu relocated to Sunpu Castle in 1586, entrusting Hamamatsu Castle to Horio Yoshiharu, who was followed by his son Horio Tadauji. Under Horio Yoshiharu, the castle was renovated in line with contemporary advances in stone ramparts, and was expanded in size. Contemporary records indicate that the castle was never built with a tenshukaku-style keep. Throughout its history, a two-story yagura located within the second bailey served as a substitute keep. After the Battle of Sekigahara, the Horio clan was relocated to Izumo Province and Hamamatsu was briefly ruled by Tokugawa Yorinobu, followed by a succession of fudai daimyō through the remainder of the Edo period. Assignment to Hamamatsu was considered a very prestigious appointment due to the castle's association with Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa shogunate. Most of the 25 daimyō who ruled Hamamatsu were assigned to Hamamatsu for only a short period, before being transferred to another domain, usually with a higher kokudaka ranking. Many also went on to hold high offices within the shogun administration, including five rōjū, two Kyoto Shoshidai, two Osaka jōdai and four Jisha-bugyō. For this reason, Hamamatsu Castle gained its nickname of Shusse Castle, meaning \\"Castle of promotion. With the Meiji Restoration, the remaining military structures of the castle were destroyed, outer moats filled in, and outer baileys sold off. The central portion was retained by the city of Hamamatsu as a park after World War II In 1958, a faux donjon was constructed out of reinforced concrete on top of the original stone palisade built by Tokugawa Ieyasu. The reconstructed structure has three stories with an observatory affording a view of the Pacific Ocean at the topmost level. There is a small museum inside which houses armor and other relics of Tokugawa clan, as well as a miniature model of how the city might have looked at the start of the Edo period. Surrounding the museum is Hamamatsu Castle Park which is planted with numerous sakura trees. A large bronze statue of Tokugawa Ieyasu also stands in the park.The castle was listed as one of the Continued Top 100 Japanese Castles in 2017.

She died of the measles at the age of three, during an epidemic of measles, whooping cough and influenza that killed more than 10,000 Native Hawaiians. Her elder brother and sister became King Kalākaua (who reigned from 1874 to 1891), and Queen Liliʻuokalani (who reigned as Hawaii's last monarch from 1891 to 1893).  Name  Her name has been traditionally spelled Kaiminaauao or Kaʻiminaʻauao with the two ʻokina, which are phonemic glottal stop, as it is used in many Polynesian languages. It is alternatively spelled as Kaiminiaauao. Her name means \\"the search for knowledge\\" in the Hawaiian language. According to Hawaiian linguist Mary Kawena Pukui, ʻimi naʻau ao means \\"to seek knowledge or education; ambitious to learn; one seeking education or learning, research, learning\\".  Family  King Kamehameha III and Queen Kalama, Kaʻiminaʻauao was born on November 7, 1845. Born into the aliʻi class of Hawaiian nobility, her father High Chief Caesar Kapaʻakea and mother High Chiefess Analea Keohokālole were advisors to the reigning king Kamehameha III. Her mother was the daughter of ʻAikanaka and Kamaʻeokalani while her father was the son of Kamanawa II (half-brother of ʻAikanaka) and Kamokuiki. From her parents, she descended from Keaweaheulu and Kameʻeiamoku, the royal counselors of Kamehameha I during his conquest of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Kameʻeiamoku, the grandfather of both her mother and father, was one of the royal twins alongside Kamanawa depicted on the Hawaiian coat of arms. Kaʻiminaʻauao's family were collateral relations of the House of Kamehameha. Another relative of the family was the High Chiefess Kapiʻolani who plucked the sacred ʻōhelo berries and openly defied the goddess Pele as a dramatic demonstration of her new faith in Christianity. The fifth child and third daughter of a large family, her sibling included James Kaliokalani, David Kalākaua (who reigned as king from 1874 to 1891), Lydia Kamakaʻeha (who reigned as Hawaii's last monarch, Queen Liliʻuokalani from 1891 to 1893), Anna Kaʻiulani, Miriam Likelike, and William Pitt Leleiohoku II. All her siblings were given away in hānai to other family members and friends. The Hawaiian custom of hānai is an informal form of adoption between extended families practiced by Hawaiian royals and commoners alike. She was adopted by Queen Kalama, the wife of King Kamehameha III. The royal couple were childless at the time because two sons born to Kalama (both named Keaweaweʻulaokalani) had died during infancy. Kamehameha III had previously adopted his half-sister Kīnaʻu's son Alexander Liholiho (the future Kamehameha IV) as his heir and successor. Contemporary English sources referred to Kaʻiminaʻauao as the ward of the queen.  Death and funeral  The measles, brought to Hilo by an American warship, killed about a third of the Hawaiian population. Measles, whooping cough and influenza epidemics killed 10,000 people, mostly Native Hawaiians; among the high chiefs who died were Moses Kekūāiwa (son of Kīnaʻu and Kekūanāoʻa), William Pitt Leleiohoku I (husband of Ruth Keʻelikōlani) and the three-year-old Kaʻiminaʻauao, who died on November 10, 1848.; ; The bodies of the deceased were embalmed with alcohol in lead coffins and placed inside wooden coffins. Initially buried in the Pohukaina Tomb, located on grounds of ʻIolani Palace, her remains were left behind when the coffins of other royals were moved to the newly constructed Royal Mausoleum at Mauna ʻAla in the Nuʻuanu Valley in 1865. This changed after the accession of her brother as king. On the evening of November 30, 1875, her remains and the remains of her parents, buried at the cemetery of Kawaiahaʻo Church, were transported to the Royal Mausoleum followed by torchlight under a military escort led by John Owen Dominis.; In a ceremony officiated by her sister Liliʻuokalani on June 24, 1910, her remains, and those of her family, were transferred for a final time to the underground Kalākaua Crypt after the main mausoleum building had been converted into a chapel.; ; ; Kaʻiminaʻauao's three elder siblings were educated at the Chiefs' Children's School (later renamed the Royal School) founded in 1839 by the American missionary couple Amos Starr Cooke and Juliette Montague Cooke to provide a Western-style education to the Hawaiian royal children. The children at the school were chosen by Kamehameha III to be eligible for the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaii. It was intended that Kaʻiminaʻauao would join the school. However, her early death and the death of other aliʻi children in the epidemic prevented the addition of new scholars to the school. This deficit of scholars would lead to the closure of the school in 1850.

She was also a singer with the revolving-door group Tokyo Performance Doll (TPD) alongside Ryoko Shinohara. She was part of TPD for a while but sought to do something different, deciding to try rap. Ichii began practicing her rapping in preparation for a solo show with her friend Gaku, who was a part of the group East End. In February 1994 when Gaku performed with Yuri for part of her show, she was seen by File Records (the independent record label that signed East End). They were impressed with her and decided to sign them together for a mini-album. History Initially, as one of the members of East End, DJ Yoggy was skeptical of working with Ichii because he saw her only as a pop idol singer (as she was with TPD) and thought she would not be able to perform live. He later found out that she could perform quite well live and came around. In June 1994, East End X Yuri released the mini-album titled Denim-ed Soul on File Records with four songs.

But I > don't think those words really fit me.\\"https://doi.org/ The popularity of East End X Yuri helped usher in a newly found mainstream acceptance for hip hop and hip hop culture. Due to the pop explosion of East End X Yuri, many popular Japanese rappers began embracing a more bubblegum, pop-friendly style, with most mainstream Japanese rappers finding success in writing non-threatening and non-offensive lyrics. However, today, many thuggish rappers are also experiencing mainstream success, with artists like Hannya, Maria, Rappagariya, Ozrosaurus and Seeda on the forefront. This new popularity spark in rugged hip hop can be seen as a polar opposite turn, versus the original pop-influenced hip-hop style that artists such as East End x Yuri pioneered.

Example  The intuition behind the RDD is well illustrated using the evaluation of merit-based scholarships. The main problem with estimating the causal effect of such an intervention is the homogeneity of performance to the assignment of treatment (e.g. scholarship award): Since high-performing students are more likely to be awarded the merit scholarship and continue performing well at the same time, comparing the outcomes of awardees and non-recipients would lead to an upward bias of the estimates. Even if the scholarship did not improve grades at all, awardees would have performed better than non-recipients, simply because scholarships were given to students who were performing well ex ante. Despite the absence of an experimental design, a RDD can exploit exogenous characteristics of the intervention to elicit causal effects. If all students above a given grade—for example 80%—are given the scholarship, it is possible to elicit the local treatment effect by comparing students around the 80% cut- off: The intuition here is that a student scoring 79% is likely to be very similar to a student scoring 81%—given the pre-defined threshold of 80%, however, one student will receive the scholarship while the other will not. Comparing the outcome of the awardee (treatment group) to the counterfactual outcome of the non-recipient (control group) will hence deliver the local treatment effect.  Methodology  The two most common approaches to estimation using a RDD are non-parametric and parametric (normally polynomial regression). = Non-parametric estimation = The most common non-parametric method used in the RDD context is a local linear regression. This is of the form: : Y = \\\\alpha + \\\\tau D + \\\\beta_{1}(X-c) + \\\\beta_{2}D(X-c) + \\\\varepsilon , where c is the treatment cut-off and D is a binary variable equal to one if X \\\\ge c. Letting h be the bandwidth of data used, we have c - h \\\\le X \\\\le c + h . Different slopes and intercepts fit data on either side of the cutoff. Typically either a rectangular kernel (no weighting) or a triangular kernel are used. Research favors the triangular kernel but the rectangular kernel has a more straightforward interpretation. The major benefit of using non- parametric methods in a RDD is that they provide estimates based on data closer to the cut-off, which is intuitively appealing. This reduces some bias that can result from using data farther away from the cutoff to estimate the discontinuity at the cutoff. More formally, local linear regressions are preferred because they have better bias properties and have better convergence. However, the use of both types estimation, if feasible, is a useful way to argue that the estimated results do not rely too heavily on the particular approach taken. = Parametric estimation = An example of a parametric estimation is: : Y = \\\\alpha + \\\\beta_1 x_i + \\\\beta_2 c_i + \\\\beta_3 c_i^2 + \\\\beta_4 c_i^3 + \\\\varepsilon , where : x_i= \\\\begin{cases} 1\\\\text{ if }c_i \\\\geq \\\\bar{c}\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\text{ if }c_i < \\\\bar{c} \\\\end{cases} and \\\\bar{c} is the treatment cut-off. Note that the polynomial part can be shortened or extended according to the needs. = Other examples = * Policies in which treatment is determined by an age eligibility criterion (e.g. pensions, minimum legal drinking age). * Elections in which one politician wins by a marginal majority. *Placement scores within education that sort students into treatment programs.  Required assumptions  Regression discontinuity design requires that all potentially relevant variables besides the treatment variable and outcome variable be continuous at the point where the treatment and outcome discontinuities occur. One sufficient, though not necessary , condition is if the treatment assignment is \\"as good as random\\" at the threshold for treatment. If this holds, then it guarantees that those who just barely received treatment are comparable to those who just barely did not receive treatment, as treatment status is effectively random. Treatment assignment at the threshold can be \\"as good as random\\" if there is randomness in the assignment variable and the agents considered (individuals, firms, etc.) cannot perfectly manipulate their treatment status. For example, if the treatment is passing an exam, where a grade of 50% is required, then this example is a valid regression discontinuity design so long as grades are somewhat random, due either to randomness of grading or randomness of student performance. Students must not also be able to perfectly manipulate their grade so as to perfectly determine their treatment status. Two examples include students being able to convince teachers to \\"mercy pass\\" them, or students being allowed to re-take the exam until they pass. In the former case, those students who barely fail but are able to secure a \\"mercy pass\\" may differ from those who just barely fail but cannot secure a \\"mercy pass\\". This leads to selection bias, as the treatment and control groups now differ. In the latter case, some students may decide to retake the exam, stopping once they pass. This also leads to selection bias since only some students will decide to retake the exam. = Testing the validity of the assumptions = It is impossible to definitively test for validity if agents are able to perfectly determine their treatment status. However, there are some tests that can provide evidence that either supports or discounts the validity of the regression discontinuity design.  Density test  McCrary (2008) density test on data from Lee, Moretti, and Butler (2004). McCray (2008) suggested examining the density of observations of the assignment variable. If there is a discontinuity in the density of the assignment variable at the threshold for treatment, then this may suggest that some agents were able to perfectly manipulate their treatment status. For example, if several students are able to get a \\"mercy pass\\", then there will be more students who just barely passed the exam than who just barely failed. Similarly, if students are allowed to retake the exam until they pass, then there will be a similar result. In both cases, this will likely show up when the density of exam grades is examined. \\"Gaming the system\\" in this manner could bias the treatment effect estimate.  Continuity of observable variables  Since the validity of the regression discontinuity design relies on those who were just barely treated being the same as those who were just barely not treated, it makes sense to examine if these groups are similar based on observable variables. For the earlier example, one could test if those who just barely passed have different characteristics (demographics, family income, etc.) than those who just barely failed. Although some variables may differ for the two groups based on random chance, most of these variables should be the same.  Falsification tests  = Predetermined variables = Similar to the continuity of observable variables, one would expect there to be continuity in predetermined variables at the treatment cut-off. Since these variables were determined before the treatment decision, treatment status should have no effect on them. Consider the earlier merit-based scholarship example. If the outcome of interest is future grades, then we would not expect the scholarship to affect earlier grades. If a discontinuity in predetermined variables is present at the treatment cut-off, then this puts the validity of the regression discontinuity design into question. = Other discontinuities = If discontinuities are present at other points of the assignment variable, where these are not expected, then this may make the regression discontinuity design suspect. Consider the example of Carpenter and Dobkin (2011) who studied the effect of legal access to alcohol in the United States. As access to alcohol increases at age 21, this leads to changes in various outcomes, such as mortality rates and morbidity rates. If mortality and morbidity rates also increase discontinuously at other ages, then it throws the interpretation of the discontinuity at age 21 into question.  Inclusion and exclusion of covariates  If parameter estimates are sensitive to removing or adding covariates to the model, then this may cast doubt on the validity of the regression discontinuity design. A significant change may suggest that those who just barely got treatment differ in these covariates from those who just barely did not get treatment. Including covariates would remove some of this bias. If a large amount of bias is present, and the covariates explain a significant amount of this, then their inclusion or exclusion would significantly change the parameter estimate. Recent work has shown how to add covariates, under what conditions doing so is valid, and the potential for increased precision.  Advantages  * When properly implemented and analyzed, the RDD yields an unbiased estimate of the local treatment effect. The RDD can be almost as good as a randomized experiment in measuring a treatment effect. * RDD, as a quasi-experiment, does not require ex ante randomization and circumvents ethical issues of random assignment. *Well- executed RDD studies can generate treatment effect estimates similar to estimates from randomized studies.  Disadvantages  * The estimated effects are only unbiased if the functional form of the relationship between the treatment and outcome is correctly modeled. The most popular caveats are non- linear relationships that are mistaken as a discontinuity. * Contamination by other treatments. If another treatment occurs at the same cut-off value of the same assignment variable, then the measured discontinuity in the outcome variable may be partially attributed to this other treatment. For example, suppose a researcher wishes to study the impact of legal access to alcohol on mental health using a regression discontinuity design at the minimum legal drinking age. The measured impact could be confused with legal access to gambling, which may occur at the same age.  Extensions  = Fuzzy RDD = The identification of causal effects hinges on the crucial assumption that there is indeed a sharp cut-off, around which there is a discontinuity in the probability of assignment from 0 to 1. In reality, however, cut-offs are often not strictly implemented (e.g. exercised discretion for students who just fell short of passing the threshold) and the estimates will hence be biased. In contrast to the sharp regression discontinuity design, a fuzzy regression discontinuity design (FRDD) does not require a sharp discontinuity in the probability of assignment but is applicable as long as the probability of assignment is different. The intuition behind it is related to the instrumental variable strategy and intention to treat. = Regression kink design = When the assignment variable is continuous (e.g. student aid) and depends predictably on another observed variable (e.g. family income), one can identify treatment effects using sharp changes in the slope of the treatment function. This technique was coined regression kink design by Nielsen, Sørensen, and Tabe (2010), though they cite similar earlier analyses. They write, \\"This approach resembles the regression discontinuity idea. Instead of a discontinuity of in the level of the stipend-income function, we have a discontinuity in the slope of the function.\\" Rigorous theoretical foundations were provided by Card et al. (2012) and an empirical application by Bockerman et al. (2018). Note that regression kinks (or kinked regression) can also mean a type of segmented regression, which is a different type of analysis. Final Considerations The RD design takes the shape of a quasi-experimental research design with a clear structure that is devoid of randomized experimental features. Several aspects deny the RD designs an allowance for a status quo. For instance, the designs often involve serious issues that do not offer room for random experiments. Besides, the design of the experiments depends on the accuracy of the modelling process and the relationship between inputs and outputs.

In the Soviet Union, a military district (, voyenny okrug) was a territorial association of military units, formations, military schools, and various local military administrative establishments. This territorial division type was utilised in the USSR to provide a more efficient management of army units, their training and other operations activities related to combat readiness. First military districts in the USSR begun with the formation of the first six military districts (Yaroslavsky, Moskovsky, Orlovsky, Belomorsky, Uralsky, and Privolzhsky) on 31 March 1918 during the Russian Civil War to prepare substantial army reserves for the front. The next reform did not take place until the economic reforms (NEP) of 1923 which concluded in 1929. At this time the military districts in the Russian Soviet Republic still conformed to the gubernyas and oblasts of the Russian Empire, with the exception of the other republics each of which constituted a military district in their own right.

The highway travels north through farmland and serves Withrow before climbing Lone Butte and turning east into 14th Road NW. SR 172 continues east into Mansfield, where it becomes Main Street and turns southeast into Downtown at Mansfield High School. The roadway turns northeast onto Railroad Avenue, serving the Mansfield Airport. SR 172 leaves Mansfield and continues east as 14th Road NE until it ends at SR 17 at Sims Corner, north of Coulee City. Every year the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 200 and 690 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly in Mansfield. History A gravel county road extending from Lone Butte through Mansfield to Sims Corner first appeared in a 1933 Department of Highways map of Washington. The road was paved and used temporarily by Primary State Highway 10 (PSH 10) until a Bridgeport-Leahy road was built to the northeast in the 1950s. A paved road from Mansfield to Withrow and Farmer was built by 1950 and was signed as an extension of Secondary State Highway 10B (SSH 10B) in 1955. SSH 11B was split into SR 172 and SR 174 in the 1964 highway renumbering, and no major revisions to the highway has occurred since.

If the letter is a duplicate already earned by the player, no extra letters are earned. The first player that spells out BINGO from the earned letters wins the game. A Free-Space Ball with a sponsor's logo acts as a wild card in the game. The player who answers a question correctly when that ball is rolled out can choose any letter, and $100 is added to the bank. Two regular games are played. Contestants who win both games win the match and receive all the money in the bank. If each contestant wins one game, a five- question tie-breaker game is played. The first question's answer begins with a B, the second question's answer starts with I, and so on. The first to answer three questions correctly wins the money in the bank and goes on to play the Bingo Bonus Board for a chance at $100,000. If time runs short during a game, gameplay moves to a 50/50 round. In the 50/50 round the remaining questions of that game are asked in a multiple-choice fashion, with two possible answers given. Contestants who answer incorrectly at this point have credit for the question (and the given letter, if applicable) automatically given to their opponent; however, no money is added to the bank for that question. =Bonus round= The winner of the main game plays the Bingo Bonus Board, which used two different formats. In the first season of the show, each number on the Bingo Bonus Board represented a cash amount or another prize, up to a grand prize of $100,000 cash. Every prize was repeated at least twice on the board. The contestant chose one number at a time, and won the first prize to be revealed twice. In the second season, 55 of the 75 spaces concealed cash values, while 20 hid \\"wrecking balls.\\" Contestants started with the \\"B\\" row (the only row without wrecking balls) and selected a number in that row. After each selection, the contestants could leave the game with the money already won or risk their winnings and continue with a selection in the next row. Contestants who chose wrecking balls lost the money they had accumulated in the bonus round. Contestants who made five successful picks kept all of their accumulated bonus money and activated the Bingo Sphere one more time for the Superball. If any of the contestants' five chosen bonus numbers matched the one on the Superball, their bonus round winnings were augmented to $100,000. Marine John Stefan was the first contestant to win $100,000, doing so under the first format on April 11, 2008. John Hanlin was the only player to win the top prize under the second format, doing so on October 22, 2008. =Home viewer interaction= At-home viewers are also allowed to play along with the show downloading bingo cards available at GSN's website. Once the taping of the show is complete and all of the randomly drawn numbers have been recorded, a computer generates bingo cards that viewers can then download and print for the broadcast of the show a few weeks later. A home player who earns a \\"Bingo\\" is directed to GSN's website to claim a $50 prize. Production The series, created by veteran television producer Andrew Glassman, was first announced as green-lit on January 30, 2008. The first season contained 40 episodes, which began airing on March 31, 2008. A second season of the series, consisting of 65 episodes, debuted on October 6, 2008, with Karn and Mizota joining the show. When asked to explain the host change, GSN argued that while Duffy was a \\"terrific\\" host and the network \\"loved working with him,\\" Karn was \\"a perfect fit for all the exciting changes [in the second season].\\" Reception Bingo America received mixed critical reception. David Hinckley of the New York Daily News argued that the series only got \\"partly there\\" in attempting to bring bingo to television, and \\"doesn't quite capture what the game is about.\\" Additionally, Ed Bark, a former television critic at The Dallas Morning News, argued that the show, \\"moves along briskly enough and it won't hurt anybody,\\" and added that it had potential to raise the level of GSN's \\"miniscule\\" audience. Merchandise In 2008, GSN announced plans to launch a new website featuring multiple variations of game show-themed merchandise; the now-defunct website was launched September 30 of that year. Among the items featured in the online store was an interactive DVD game by Imagination Entertainment based on the series' format, which was released at the time the second season premiered. The game plays similarly to the show, beginning with a \\"Bingo Draw\\" round. During this round, players attempt to be the first to earn a \\"Bingo\\" while accumulating points by correctly answering trivia questions. Once a player earns a \\"Bingo\\" the \\"Bingo Bonus Board\\" round is played. The winner of the previous round tries to add more points to their score by matching two hidden numbers; the round ends once the player finds a match. Opposing players can also earn points by guessing which numbers the other player chooses in this round. Whoever earns the most points during the game is the winner.

Synopsis The protagonist, Neil Kingsblood, a white middle-class man, discovers while researching his family background that he is directly descended from an African adventurer on the American frontier. (His ancestor is loosely modeled after Pierre Bonga, an African American who worked as a fur trader for the North West Company.)William Sherman Savage, Blacks in the West, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1976, pp. 68-70 Through various machinations, Kingsblood loses his banking job and takes a lesser one. He begins to be treated differently by former acquaintances, despite the lack of visible black African ancestry. He is forced to choose between continuing what he has come to see as a hollow existence in the white community and taking on the oppressed minority status of the black community. After Kingsblood tells several white friends about his newfound ancestry, the news quickly spreads, and he finds that acquaintances change their behavior toward him. He engages in a quixotic struggle against the racism newly apparent but widespread in his community. Because Kingsblood is now black, it is illegal for him and his family to live in their home, which is in a whites-only neighborhood. In the climactic scene, which is based on the real life Ossian Sweet incident which occurred in Detroit in 1925, a mob of their former neighbors comes to force the Kingsbloods out. The sense of helplessness against massive injustice is broken only by the final line of the work, which offers hope for the future. Background Sinclair Lewis met Walter Francis White, president of the NAACP and a man of majority European ancestry, and many of his professional circles. A number among them were persons of clearly European and African ancestry, composing the educated elites of black society. Given their visible and in some cases majority European ancestry, some had relatives or friends who had chosen to live as white based on appearance and their predominant European descent. Lewis consulted with White on the novel and was helped to meet numerous of his professional acquaintances; he learned about some contemporary issues of skin color and class within the black community. Reception While some white critics found the novel contrived, Ebony, a prominent African- American magazine, ranked it as the most important novel of the year. \\"The white establishment tended to view the novel as wildly implausible. Black people viewed it as profoundly perceptive.\\"Brent Staples, \\" 'Kingsblood Royal': When the Bard of Main Street Turned the Kingsbloods Black\\", The New York Times, 18 Aug 2002, accessed 12 Apr 2008 Shortly after the publication of Kingsblood Royal, a group of white supremacists sent a letter to J.

He served as host on those two shows, which often featured comedic sketches of his personal life, presented as cinéma vérité in audio. Moth was portrayed by Newfoundland actor Mack Furlong. Moth was created by Furlong, Steve Palmer, Ed Riche and Glen Tilley. The character resurfaced in March 2010 on urNews.ca, a satirical Canadian news website.  Backstory  The character of Paul Moth had a very large backstory. Moth was born in St. John's, Newfoundland in 1949, the day his province joined confederation as part of Canada. He was raised in a working-class family on Signal Hill road in the neighbourhood of Quidi Vidi. He received a harsh Fundamentalist Catholic education as a child. In the late 1960s, Moth enrolled in Memorial University (or MUN) to study Political Science. However, he quick became enamoured with revolutionary marxist ideology, and formed the Viet MUN, which occupied the campus weight room as a protest. Moth also became enamoured with the drug culture of the 1960s, and began a long-standing series of narcotics and alcohol addictions that form a major part of his backstory. After which time, he auditioned as announcer for a fictionalized version of the Broadcasting Corporation of Newfoundland (or BCN), and was hired to work during the early 1970s for the radio station's sports magazine show. He became disillusioned with radio, and became a freelance writer and playwright. He moved to Hollywood in 1979 after selling a teleplay to the Shirley Jones show. Moth and Shirley Jones would start a relationship and eventually be married briefly. During this time, he develops a firearms collection which would, combined with his various addictions, cause his downfall. From 1981 to 1987, Moth worked in Mexican Film, making films about a chihuahua (the \\"Mexican Lassie\\") named Pepito. His final Pepito trilogy of films would be heavily influenced by his Marxist ideology and prove impossible to finance. This resulted in a break-up with Shirley Jones, a shoot-out with the Los Angeles police, and heart failure. Afterwards from 1990 to 1992, he has no memories, but is captured by authorities. As a result, he is forcibly deported to Newfoundland. He is given a job by his former employer, the BCN. For a year, he was the sole staff member at the BCN's fictional repeater station on the uninhabited Funk Islands. Upon his return, he becomes the host of the BCN's cultural magazine show, The Great Eastern.  The Great Eastern  From 1994 to 1999, the CBC broadcast the satirical The Great Eastern as hosted by Moth. In the course of his hosting duties, he would do interviews and file audio reports on Newfoundland culture, entertainment, and politics. Over various episodes, Moth would publish an autobiography (The Rocky Road to Recovery), visit the fictional African country of Oogoobombaa, revisit the Funk Islands, go on hunting and fishing trips with childhood friends, attempt to host a late-night TV show and fail, bring down a cult based on conservative economics, and other adventures. The show was cancelled by CBC in 1999 after five seasons. It was brought back for one episode in 2002, where Moth celebrates the 100th anniversary of radio and narrowly survives a zeppelin ride.  Sunny Days and Nights  In 2004, the character of Paul Moth was put in a new CBC show called Sunny Days and Nights. Fired from the BCN, Moth gets a temporary job with fictional CBC affiliate CBNR in the \\"cottage country\\" region of Ontario. He works with a young journalism student named Julie with whom he becomes infatuated. He is forced to do boring stories and interviews about summer cottage culture and news. The series ran for only one summer.

Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, he had a difficult childhood including an abusive father, four and a half years in an orphanage, and later with a foster family in North Kildonan. He took up canoeing in his teens and at age 17 was named Most Outstanding Novice at the Kildonan Canoe Club.Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and Museum bio He competed professionally as a canoeist, winning 10 out of 12 races that he entered. In 1967, he was a member of the Manitoba team that competed in the Expo 67 Centennial Voyageur Canoe Pageant race from Rocky Mountain House, Alberta to Montreal, Quebec.Listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest canoe race in the world (3,283 miles/5,283 kilometres) The team won the race after a gruelling effort lasting 104 days.Starkell and Wilkins, p. 20. Starkell suffered serious burns to his legs, as well as smoke inhalation when a fire broke out in his house in Winnipeg in March, 2010. Paddle to the Amazon On June 1, 1980, he and his two sons, Dana and Jeff Starkell, set out on an epic canoe journey from Winnipeg to Belem, Brazil. The trip followed the Red River to its headwaters south of Fargo, North Dakota. From there the canoeists portaged to the Minnesota River and then continued down the Mississippi River to the Intracoastal Waterway at Larose, Louisiana. They followed the Waterway south to Port Isabel, Texas, where they entered the actual Gulf of Mexico, and then skirted the coast of Mexico to Veracruz where they spent three and a half months (November 1980 to mid February 1981) to recover from the journey to date, a journey that had beenand would continue to befraught with difficulty. By this time, Jeff Starkell decided to abandon the adventure and Donald and Dana continued on alone. They paddled along the rest of Mexico and Central America to South America. Off the Guajira Peninsula in Colombia they were beset by modern pirates but escaped. They almost died on the Gulf of Coro, Venezuela after being trapped on a sandbar by strong headwinds as their food supplies ran out. Eventually, on October 14, 1981 they made land at Port of Spain, Trinidad, where they recuperated for six weeks. On New Years Day, 1982, they set off from Port of Spain and three days later crossed the Columbus Channel to Venezuela. There, at Pedernales, they entered the delta of the Orinoco River. Over the next two months they paddled virtually the entire length of the Orinoco to Tama Tama where they entered the Casiquiare canal, the only natural canal in the world. Via this route they reached the Rio Negro and then the Amazon River at Manaus, Brazil. From Manaus, they paddled downriver to the Atlantic coast. The journey ended at Belem on May 2, 1982. In 1986, the names of Don Starkell and his son Dana were entered into the Guinness Book of World Records for having completed the longest canoe journey ever, a distance of .

Though comparatively shortat 3,000 milesthe trip was more difficult due to the cold weather. It lasted three years and had to be terminated just thirty miles short of its planned completion point at Tuktoyaktuk, due to the onset of winter and frostbite. Starkell lost the tops of his fingers and some of his toes. \\"When I did the Arctic trip, I gave absolutely everything I had and that was success,\\" he said.

This particular form of kinship did not exclude particular groups, such that class and other hierarchal systems did not matter in terms of milk kinship participation. Traditionally speaking, this practice predates the early modern period, though it became a widely used mechanism for developing alliances in many hierarchical societies during that time. Milk kinship used the practice of breast feeding by a wet nurse to feed a child either from the same community, or a neighbouring one. This wet nurse played the strategic role in forging relations between her family and the family of the child she was nursing, as well as their community.  In Islamic societies  In the early modern period, milk kinship was widely practiced in many Arab countries for both religious and strategic purposes. Like the Christian practice of godparenting, milk kinship established a second family that could take responsibility for a child whose biological parents came to harm. \\"Milk kinship in Islam thus appears to be a culturally distinctive, but by no means unique, institutional form of adoptive The childhood of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, illustrates the practice of traditional Arab milk kinship. In his early childhood, he was sent away to foster-parents amongst the Bedouin. By nursing him, Halimah bint Abdullah became his \\"milk-mother\\". The rest of her family was drawn into the relationship as well: her husband al-Harith became Muhammad's \\"milk-father\\", and Muhammad was raised alongside their biological children as a \\"milk- brother\\". This milk kinship creates a familial relationship, such that a man may not marry his milk-mother or his milk-sister (the daughter or milk- daughter of his milk-mother).  In Native American societies  When Crazy Horse was a baby, he nursed at the breast of every woman in the tribe. The Sioux raised their children that way. Every warrior called every woman in the tribe \\"Mother\\". Every older warrior, they called him \\"Grandfather\\".  Strategic reasons for milk kinship  \\"Colactation links two families of unequal status and creates a durable and intimate bond; it removes from 'clients' their outsider status but excludes them as marriage partners...it brings about a social relationship that is an alternative to kinship bonds based on blood.\\"R. Ensel, \\"Colactation and fictive kinship as rites of incorporation and reversal in Morocco\\", Journal of North African Studies 23 (2002), p. 93. People of different races and religions could be brought together strategically through the bonding of the milk mother and their milk 'children'. =Lower social class= Milk kinship was as relevant for peasants as 'fostering' or as 'hosting' other children, in that it secured the good will from their masters and their wives. As previously mentioned the milk women's family is the 'core range' to the child she is nursing and they become milk kin, which may strategically be useful for the future if the child is from a higher class family, as the milk women's children will become 'milk- brothers' and 'milk-sisters.' Thus peasant women would most often play the role of the 'milk' mother to her non-biological children, and they held an important role in maintaining the connection between herself and the master whose baby she is nursing. It is also important to note that it was also a practical way to assist families who were of a very ill mother or whose mother died in childbirth. This would have been helpful in many societies where, especially in times of war, if families perished, other members of society would end up co-parenting through the link of milk-kinship. =Higher social class= Portrait of Louis XIV of France as a child with his milk-sister Henrietta of England by circle of Pierre Mignard, c. 1646, National Museum in Warsaw. Noble offspring were often sent to milk kin fosterers that would foster them to maturity so that the children would be raised by their successive status subordinates. The purpose of this was for political importance to build milk kin as bodyguards. This was a major practice in the Hindu Kush society.  Conflicting theories, ideas and myths  One particular theory mentioned by Peter Parkes is an Arab folk-analogy that breast milk is supposed to be \\"transformed male semen\\" that arises from Hertiers Somatic Scheme. There is no evidence that Arabs ever considered a mother's milk to be 'transformed sperm'. Another suggested analogy is that breast milk was a refinement of uterine blood. It is also suggested since that milk is of the woman, her moods and dispositions are transferred through the breast milk. Parkes mentions that milk-kinship was \\"further endorsed as a canonical impediment to marriage by several eastern Christian churches\\". This indicates that this procedure was widely practiced among numerous religious communities, not just Islamic communities, in the early modern Mediterranean. =Héritier's somatic thesis= Soraya Altorki (1980) published a pioneering article on Sunni Arab notions of kinship created through suckling breast milk (Arabic: rida'a orrada'). Altorki indicated that milk kinship had received little attention from anthropologists, despite its recognised significance in Muslim family law as a complex impediment to marriage. Milk kinship has since attracted further fieldwork throughout Islamic Asia and North Africa, demonstrating its importance as a culturally distinctive institution of adoptive affiliation. Héritier's somatic thesis posits that Islamic marriage between milk kin is forbidden because of an ancient pre-Islamic meme that is communicated in the Arab saying 'the milk is from the man'.Françoise Héritier: Identité de substance et parenté de lait dans le monde arabe (1994). Héritier's somatic explanation has since been endorsed – and apparently confirmed – by several French ethnographers of the Maghreb, also being further developed in her monograph on incest.Françoise Héritier: Two sisters and their daughters (1999: ch. 8) In reaction, a few scholars have cited Islamic commentaries and jurisprudence. \\"A child is the product of the conjoint seed of man and woman . . . but milk is the property of woman alone; one should not conflate by analogy (qiyas) milk with male semen.\\" Al-Qurtubi, Jami' al-ahkam V.83, cited in Benkheira (2001a: 26). The rules of Sunni marital incest apply through a standard of adoptive kin relations. But the modern jurisprudence does not negate nor explain the origin of the taboo. Héritier explains Islamic juridical reckonings of milk kinship as the continuation of a somatic scheme of male filiative substances transmitted by lactation. But Parker critically interrogates its supposition of a peculiar Arab folk-physiology of lactation, whereby breast milk is supposed to be transformed male semen, yet mentions that Héritier has properly focused attention on evidently contested issues of 'patrifiliation' by breast-feeding, which remain to be understood. Parker posits that this somatic scheme seems to be unsubstantiated by current ethnographies, and also unwarranted in understanding the juridical reckoning of milk kinship that it purports to explain.  Practice in Eastern Christianity  Weisner-Hanks mentions the introduction in the fifteenth century of prohibitions in the Christian Canon Law, in which one is not allowed to marry any one suspected to be of respective kin. Individuals who shared godparents, and great grandparents were prohibited against marrying. The prohibitions against marriage also extended to that of natural godparents. This was because both natural and 'foster' or 'spiritual' parents had an investment on the child's spiritual well being, which would not be achieved by going against Canon Law. The practice of milk kinship is paralleled quite frequently, among scholarly works, with that of Christian godparent-hood or spiritual kinship. Parkes states that in both milk kinship and god-or co- parenthood \\"we deal with a fictitious kinship relationship between people of unequal status that is embedded in a long-term exchange of goods and services that we know as patronage\\".Merry Wiesner-Hanks (2006), Early Modern Europe, 1450–1789, p. 74. Iranians seemed to have \\"taken care to confine delegated suckling to subordinate non-kin – particularly those with whom marriage would be undesirable in any event\\". Marriage taboos due to milk kinship were taken very seriously since some regarded breast milk to be refined female blood from the womb, thus conveying a 'uterine substance' of kinship. Children who were milk kin to each other were prohibited to marry as well as two children from different parents who were suckled by the same woman. It was as much of a taboo to marry your milk-brother or -sister, as it was to marry a biological brother or sister. It is extremely important to understand that in all cases \\"What is forbidden by blood kinship is equally forbidden by milk kinship\\".Avner Giladi, \\"Breast-feeding in Medieval Islamic thought. A preliminary study of legal and medical writings\\", Journal of Family History 23 (1998). pp. 107–23.

The highway travels northwest along the Columbia River from SR 17 in Bridgeport to U.S. Route 97 (US 97) in Brewster. It serves as an alternate route to SR 17, which travels north of the Columbia River, and serves the Chief Joseph State Park and the Bridgeport Bar State Wildlife Recreation Area. SR 173 was established during the 1964 highway renumbering and codified in 1970, but it has been a part of the state highway system since 1931 as a branch of State Road 10, later Primary State Highway 10 (PSH 10). The highway crosses the Columbia River on the Brewster Bridge, which originally opened in 1928 and was destroyed in 1967 before being re-built a decade later. Route description Looking northbound on SR 173 in Bridgeport SR 173 begins at an intersection with SR 17 southwest of the Bridgeport Bridge in Bridgeport, a city in rural Douglas County. The two-lane street travels northwest through Bridgeport as Foster Creek Avenue and turns northeast onto 17th Avenue and later northwest as Columbia Avenue to Bridgeport Park, where SR 173 turns southwest onto 10th Street and Maple Street to leave the city. The highway turns northwest, following the Columbia River towards Chief Joseph State Park. SR 173 continues west, forming the southern boundary of the Bridgeport Bar State Wildlife Recreation Area before crossing the Columbia River into Okanogan County on the Brewster Bridge. The highway enters Brewster and becomes Bridge Street, traveling north over Swamp Creek to end at an intersection with US 97. Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 970 and 3,400 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly in Brewster. History SR 173 follows the route of wagon roads built in the late 19th century between Brewster Ferry and Bridgeport Ferry on the east side of the Columbia River. The Brewster Bridge was completed in June 1928 and the roadway was first codified in 1931 as part of a State Road 10 branch that connected Brewster to Coulee City. State Road 10 became PSH 10 and retained the branch during the creation of the primary and secondary state highway system in 1937 as the state purchased the Brewster Bridge. The branch was moved to the west side of the Columbia River, located north of Bridgeport, in 1951 and a new branch between Bridgeport and Brewster was created to continue maintenance of the paved highway. During the 1964 highway renumbering, SR 173 was established on the route of the PSH 10 branch between Bridgeport and Brewster, later re-aligned into a straighter highway and codified in 1970. The Brewster Bridge later was destroyed in a fire in August 1967, being replaced by a 15-minute ferry until the new span was opened in the 1970s. No major revisions to the route of the highway have occurred since 1970, however the state tried unsuccessfully to transfer ownership of SR 173 and the Brewster Bridge in 1986.

The highway serves major cities such as Goldendale, Yakima, Ellensburg and Wenatchee before continuing towards the Alaska Highway at the Yukon border as British Columbia Highway 97. Along the length of the roadway, US 97 is concurrent with State Route 14 (SR 14) in Maryhill, Interstate 82 (I-82) and US 12 between Union Gap and Ellensburg, I-90 briefly in Ellensburg, US 2 between Peshastin and rural Douglas County and SR 20 near Omak. An alternate route connects the highway with Chelan. The first segment of what is now US 97 in Washington to be included in the state highway system was a road extending from Wenatchee to Twisp, designated in 1897. Since, four early highways formed the modern route of the roadway: State Road 8, State Road 3, State Road 2 and State Road 10, all signed in 1923. The United States Numbered Highways were established in 1926 and US 97 was co-signed with all four state roads, including two concurrencies with US 410 and US 10. The state roads became Primary state highways in 1937, keeping their numbers from the previous system and US 10 was moved south in 1940 and its original alignment, including the concurrency, became US 2 in 1946. The Sam Hill Memorial Bridge, originally named the Biggs Rapids Bridge, was first opened on November 1, 1962, but the river has been crossed by a ferry at the same location since the early 1920s. During the 1964 highway renumbering, all four highways were replaced by US 97 and in 1956, the Interstate Highway System was established, including two highways (I-82 and I-90) concurrent with US 97. US 12 replaced US 410 during its extension west in 1967. In 1987, US 97 was moved across the Columbia River in Chelan County, establishing US 97 Alternate and decommissioning SR 151. Until 2006, US 197 was co-signed with SR 14 between Dallesport and Maryhill. The bridge deck was replaced between 2007 and 2009 and the bridge was closed in 2008. Five other minor projects, such as repavings and sidewalk additions, have already been completed, but eight projects have yet to be completed. Route description US 97 is a major highway in Washington that spans and consists of mostly two lanes; it is undivided except for the sections that are in urban areas, such as Wenatchee and concurrent with I-82 and I-90. The entire route from the Oregon state line to the Canada–US border is part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways considered important to the nation's economy, defense and mobility. At the southern terminus of the I-82 – US 12 concurrency in Union Gap, US 97 had an estimated daily average of 20,000 motorists in 2007, making it both the busiest segment of the highway in Washington and the fifth busiest segment of U.S. routes in Washington. The busiest segment of US 97 in 1970 was at Main Street in Selah, with a daily average of 17,100 motorists. An aerial view of Maryhill, the first community on US 97, where the highway travels over the Columbia River on the Sam Hill Memorial Bridge, visible in the background. US 97 begins at the Oregon state line over the Columbia River on the Sam Hill Memorial Bridge. After exiting the bridge, the highway enters Maryhill, passes the Maryhill State Park and crosses railroad tracks on the Vancouver–Pasco route operated by BNSF Railway. From the crossing, the roadway becomes briefly concurrent with State Route 14 (SR 14) west for before turning north to intersect SR 14 Spur (via a couplet) and leaving the Maryhill area. From Maryhill, the road curves northeast and later north to pass Centerville and bypass Goldendale to intersect SR 142. US 97 then turns northeast through Brooks Memorial State Park and entering the Yakama Indian Reservation passes over Satus Pass then coming out of the Cascades into the Yakima Valley passes the Toppenish National Wildlife Refuge and Toppenish, where it intersects SR 22 and Fort Road, which was SR 220 until 1991. After leaving Toppenish in a northwestern direction, the highway parallels the Tacoma–Pasco route of the BNSF Railway and the Interstate 82 (I-82) – US 12 concurrency briefly past Wapato and some minor roads to also parallel the Yakima River and enter Union Gap, where the roadway joins the I-82 and US 12 concurrency. I-82 and US 97 pass over Selah Creek on the Fred G. Redmon Bridge north of Selah. From the interchange in which US 97 joins the I-82 / US 12, numbered exit 37, the freeway interchanges with many minor streets in Union Gap and some major highways, including a state route, in Yakima, including Valley Mall Boulevard at exit 36, SR 24 and Nob Hill Boulevard at exit 34, Terrace Heights Way and Yakima Avenue at exit 33; at exit 31, US 12 ends its long concurrency at the southern terminus of SR 823. After leaving Yakima, the highway enters Selah and interchanges with SR 823 and Rest Haven Road and then later leaves the city after interchanging Selah Road to cross Selah Creek on the Fred G. Redmon Bridge. Approaching Ellensburg, the roadway interchanges with SR 821 at exit 26, Military Road at exit 11 and the northern end of SR 821 at exit 3 before entering Ellensburg. I-82 later ends its concurrency and route at I-90, were a brief concurrency begins. The I-90 concurrency begins at exit 110, which is a trumpet interchange. Then, I-90 / US 97 interchanges Canyon Road at exit 109 and then US 97 leaves the concurrency at exit 106. From I-90, the highway turns northwest, passing SR 10 southeast of Thorp, a railroad track owned by BNSF Railway, and SR 970 in Virden to Blewett Pass, where US 97 crosses the Cascades. At Peshastin, the roadway starts its concurrency with US 2 at a diamond interchange. From Peshastin, US 2 / US 97 parallels another BNSF route and passes Dryden and Cashmere before entering Wenatchee and intersecting Washington State Route 285 and later US 97 Alternate. After the intersection with US 97 Alternate, which is actually a partial cloverleaf interchange, the roadway crosses the Columbia River on the Richard Odabashian Bridge into East Wenatchee, where it intersects SR 28, turns north and starts to parallel the Wenatchee—Oroville route of the Cascade and Columbia River Railroad. After paralleling the Columbia River, US 2 leaves the concurrency at Orondo. The road continues north and later east along the Columbia River from Orondo to Chelan Falls, where US 97 once again crosses the Columbia River, on the Beebe Bridge and then intersects SR 150. After leaving Chelan Falls, the highway follows the Columbia River and passes the northern terminus of US 97 Alternate, which goes west to Chelan, and continues north to intersect SR 153 south of Pateros. After leaving the city, the roadway travels northeast to Brewster, where it intersects SR 173. After leaving Brewster, US 97 crosses the Okanogan River and passes Anderson Field to intersect SR 17 north of Fort Okanogan State Park. From SR 17, the highway parallels the Okanogan River north past Monse and Malott to Okanogan, where the roadway enters the Colville Indian Reservation and starts a long concurrency with SR 20. From the beginning of the concurrency, the road crosses a railroad and intersects SR 155. US 97 / SR 20 then crosses over SR 155 on a bridge and crosses the Okanogan River. After the crossing, the roadway leaves Omak, along with the Colville Indian Reservation and intersects SR 215. From SR 215, the highway continues north past North Omak and Riverside to cross the Okanogan River again and enter Tonasket, where SR 20 leaves the concurrency. After leaving Tonasket, the road continues north along the Okanogan River to Oroville, the last major community on US 97 before the border. The Okanogan River becomes Osoyoos Lake at this point and the highway parallels the lake to the Canada–US border, where the roadway becomes British Columbia Highway 97 (BC 97) and continues north towards Alaska. History =Late 19th and early 20th centuries= The first segment of US 97 to be included in Washington's state highway system was a roadway extending from Wenatchee to Twisp, although the US 97 segment ended in Pateros, established in 1897. In 1905, another road from Pateros to Okanogan was added to the system, which would be extended to the Canada–US border in 1907. That roadway from Wenatchee to Canada, was named the Wenatchee-Oroville Road and numbered State Road 10. A different road, located along the Oregon state line on the Columbia River, was established as State Road 8, the Columbia River Road and ran north from Maryhill to Goldendale. Six years later, in 1913, State Road 7 was created on a Virden–Wenatchee route. The Inland Empire Highway was established in 1915 and the section it overlapped with present-day US 97 ran from Buena northwest to Ellensburg. State Road 2 replaced State Road 7 in 1919 and a branch, the Southern Division of the Sunset Highway, was established in 1919 and ran south from State Road 2 at Virden to Ellensburg. During the early 1920s, a ferry was established over the Columbia River between Biggs Junction, Oregon and Maryhill. State Road 8 between Goldendale and Buena was established in 1923. US 97 was established along with the rest of the U.S. routes in 1926, including US 10 and US 410, which were concurrent with US 97. All state roads became Primary state highways in 1937 and they kept their numbers; a branch of Primary State Highway 8 (PSH 8) was also established, connecting the Maryhill ferry to PSH 8 in Maryhill. Another concurrency was added in 1946, when US 2 was extended west, co-signed with US 97 between Peshastin and Wenatchee. =Late 20th century= panoramic view of the Sam Hill Memorial Bridge, which carries US 97 over the Columbia River into Oregon. The bridge opened on November 1, 1962 as the Biggs Rapids Bridge and the deck was replaced between October 2007 and March 2009. On June 29, 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 into law, establishing a system of freeways that would later become the Interstate Highway System. Included in the system were Interstate 82 (I-82) and I-90, which were to be concurrent with US 97. The Biggs Rapids Bridge (later renamed to the Sam Hill Memorial Bridge) was opened on November 1, 1962, replacing the ferry that had been operating on the route since the early 1920s. A new system of highways was introduced in 1964 and ultimately caused US 97 to replace the Primary state highways. US 410 was replaced by a western extension of US 12 in 1967, when the highway's western terminus was moved to Aberdeen. In 1973, a segment of US 97 between Selah and Ellensburg was realigned east away from the Yakima River and onto I-82, while the former route became SR 821. Between US 97 / US 10, which would later be decommissioned by 1970, near Thorp and US 97 in Virden, there was a SR 131. In 1975, to reduce the SR 10 concurrency, US 97 replaced SR 131 and the old route became SR 10 and SR 970. SR 131 would later be routed on another route in the Randle area in 1991. Within Selah, US 97 was also moved onto I-82 away from the city, so the old route became SR 823 in 1984. Prior to 1987, US 97 ran on the west side of the Columbia River between Wenatchee and Chelan, while SR 151 ran on the east side. US 97 was moved onto SR 151 in 1987 and the old US 97 became US 97 Alternate. =Early 21st century= Beginning in 2006, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has completed five construction projects on the US 97 corridor, ranging from a bridge deck replacement in Maryhill to repaving the roadway between Oroville area and Canada. Construction on a three-part project to install guardrails on dangerous portions of the highway began on May 16, 2006. The project was finished on August 17, 2006 and improved a segment near Blewett Pass, a section in the Colville Indian Reservation and a segment between Riverside and Oroville. Prior to October 5, 2006, US 197, an auxiliary route of US 97, ended at US 97, co-signed with SR 14, in Maryhill. On October 5, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) decommissioned US 197 between Dallesport and Maryhill. Between 29 May and September 28, 2007, WSDOT repaved the roadway between Cordell, located south of Oroville, and the Canada–US border. In July 2008, WSDOT completed installing guardrails on the road in Klickitat County. Between August 11 and December 5, 2008, WSDOT added sidewalks and illumination along a long stretch of the highway between Main Street and SR 173 in Brewster. Since the opening of the Sam Hill Memorial Bridge in 1962, the bridge has used a lightweight concrete and asphalt bridge deck. Now, the bridge is a heavily used truck route and requires a heavy concrete deck. In late 2006, a replacement project was planned and the estimated $16 million USD cost was split between the governments of Washington and Oregon. The whole bridge was replaced by WSDOT, including the Oregon side. The project was accelerated to Fall 2007, but the bridge wasn't closed until January 2, 2008. During construction on January 15, approximately 8:00 (PST), a worker was seriously injured after an excavator fell into the Columbia River. After the area was cleaned, the project resumed on January 23 and a worker died after falling off the bridge on February 26. By April, half of the new deck was complete and the bridge was reopened on 19 May, at 18:00 (PST). Although the bridge was reopened, it was once again closed on September 3 for more repairs. The bridge was reopened on December 24 and all roadwork was completed on March 23, 2009. =Future projects= As of 2009, eight projects on the corridor have not been completed yet and some are currently under construction. Between April 27 and June 30, completed the second phase of emergency flood repairs to US 97 at Blewett Pass because the 5 – January 6 floods washed out the roadway. The third and final phase is set to begin on August 17. The Janis Bridge was first constructed and completed in 1957 and on June 15, 2009, a construction project to the rehabilitate the bridge deck begam. Construction will cease on July 27. On June 22, construction began on a project to install a new traffic signal at the SR 155 intersection in Okanogan, two variable-message signs and two traffic cameras near the Canada–US border. On July 27, WSDOT will start to fix an unstable slope north of Blewett Pass, south of the US 2 intersection. Another project set to begin on July 27 to fix an unstable slope on US 97 near Blewett Pass. WSDOT will add a passing lane on the highway at Blewett Pass in summer 2010. The bridge over Satus Creek, located within the Yakama Indian Reservation in Klickitat County will be replaced in 2010. A repaving project between Orondo and Chelan Falls has been put on hold until 2016, originally scheduled for 2010. Special routes =Maryhill couplet= At the intersection with State Route 14 Spur (SR 14 Spur) in Maryhill, US 97 becomes split into two different roadways and the long southbound road that intersects the spur is identified as a couplet. The busiest section of the US 97 couplet in 2007 was at the US 97 intersection, with a daily average of 2,000 motorists. =Alternate route= U.S. Route 97 Alternate (US 97 Alt.) is a long alternate route that extends from the US 97 / US 2 concurrency north of Wenatchee along the west side of the Columbia River to US 97 east of Chelan, completely in Chelan County. The highway begins at a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 97 / US 2 north of Wenatchee and west of the Richard Odabashian Bridge over the Columbia River. After leaving the interchange, the roadway parallels the eastern boundary of the Wenatchee National Forest to cross the Entiat River and pass Entiat before intersecting SR 971 twice, the second time being on the southern shores of Lake Chelan. The road continues east across the Chelan River into Chelan as various streets, such as Woodin Avenue, Webster Avenue and Saunders Street before intersecting SR 150, leaving Chelan, passing Lake Chelan Airport and ending at US 97. In 1897, US 97 Alternate was a part of a Wenatchee–Twisp highway. That highway became a part of US 97 in 1926 and later US 97 Alternate in 1987 when US 97 was moved east of the river over SR 151. The busiest section of US 97 Alternate in 2007 was north of the US 97 / US 2 interchange, with a daily average of 9,700 motorists. =Orondo spur= U.S. Route 97 Spur (US 97 Spur) is a long spur route that connects US 97 north of the terminus of the US 2 concurrency to US 2 east of the end of the concurrency, completely located in Orondo, a community in Douglas County. The busiest section of US 97 Spur in 2007 was at the US 97 intersection, with a daily average of 250 motorists.

Dioecious and extremely slow growing, the name means \\"similar to Orania\\" and the Latin epithet translates to \\"appendaged\\".  Description  Oraniopsis appendiculata trunks are gray, solitary, from 30 to 45 cm wide, usually reaching to 6 m in height, though mature individuals in habitat can reach up to 18 m. It may be, however, 20 or 30 years before an emergent trunk develops. In juvenile life the plant is a ground-level rosette of 3 – 4 m pinnate leaves on short, wide petioles. In dense forests with little light they may be ground rosettes for up to 60 years,Uhl, Natalie W. and Dransfield, John (1987) Genera Palmarum - A classification of palms based on the work of Harold E. Moore. Lawrence, Kansas: Allen Press. / and in these conditions the leaf, stretching for sunlight, may elongate to 8 m. The pinnae are deep green above, glaucous below, regularly arranged with one fold. Once trunk forming, the leaf crown is feather-duster shaped, rarely hemispherical, the stiff leaves upward pointing, and usually persistent after dying, forming a skirt around the trunk.Riffle, Robert L. and Craft, Paul (2003) An Encyclopedia of Cultivated Palms. Portland: Timber Press. / The inflorescence emerges in the leaf crown and is shorter than the leaves, to 75 cm, with superficially similar male and female flowers on separate plants. From one carpel, the fruit ripens to yellow or orange with one seed. Seed germination is a lengthy process, to a year or more, with some seeds resisting germination to four years. On sprouting, the plant is invariably slow-moving, failing to show trunk height for multiple decades. Unless the rate of growth markedly increases in later life, the biggest specimens in Queensland are probably several hundred years old. Despite bearing resemblance to their namesake, this plant is most closely related to the South American palm Ceroxylon, differing only in the amount of peduncular bracts, the bracteole flowers, and the free, rather than basally fused, petals. Distribution and habitat Found in the Australian rain forest between the Tully River area, down to the Big Tableland south of Cooktown, and as far inland as the Great Dividing Range southwest of Atherton. Mostly from 300 to 1500 m, they may be found on rocky hillsides and coastal sands but are most common in rainy, cloudy forests. They often grow in rich organic soil or basaltic medium, but are absent from deep soil and open plains.

He was also the founder of Jules Montenier, Inc., a cosmetics company. He was famous for inventing Stopette, an anti-perspirant that was a longtime sponsor of the CBS game show What's My Line?And Now a Word From Our Sponsor. Our Only Sponsor. - New York Times Stopette's slogan, repeated at the beginning of the episodes Montenier's company sponsored, was \\"Poof!

Patents and innovations Montenier holds a number of patents. Arguably, his primary patent is US Patent No. 2,230,084,Publication Images which is a January 28, 1941, patent for Astringent Preparation. This patent dealt with solving the problem of the excessive acidity of aluminum chloride, then as now, the best-working anti-perspirant known to chemistry, by adding a soluble nitrile or a similar compound. This innovation found its way into \\"Stopette\\" anti-perspirant/deodorant spray, which Time Magazine called \\"the best-selling deodorant of the early 1950s.\\" A virtually identical patent was granted in the United Kingdom as GB0527439. Montenier also holds US Design Patent D168,109 for the ornamental design of his \\"Stopette\\" bottle,http://www.google.com/patents/pdf/MONTENIER_FLEXIBLE_BOTTLE.pdf?id=uPxzAAAAEBAJ&output;=pdf&sig;=WFOtEuOsnpPrTR9gYF9KerD4GUY the shape of which was on the scorecards of What's My Line? when \\"Stopette\\" sponsored the show.

In the opening segment that featured Stopette, Jules Montenier, Inc. also advertised \\"Poof! Deodorant Body Powder\\" and \\"Finesse, the Flowing Cream Shampoo\\" in the same segment. In mid-1953, Dr. Montenier himself was pictured in the opening segment after the products were mentioned. =Sponsorship of the show= During the first two episodes of What's My Line? in 1950, the production value was atrocious. While everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong on the first show, the second show was arguably as bad. If anything, the camera work was worse. CBS liked many elements of the show, but the production value had to be improved. CBS knew that a potential sponsor could be watching the third show, so it issued an ultimatum: Either a sponsor would pick up the show, or the show would be history.TVgameshows.net Franklin M. Heller, one of television's pioneering directors, essentially saved the show. He felt that the biggest problems with the show were too much camera movement and lens changing. Heller said, \\"I figured once I could get those cameramen and their flowered shirts controlled and fairly immobile, we might be able to let this show emerge.\\"Id. To fix the problem, Heller changed the format of the set so that the cameras would remain stationary. He also placed moderator John Daly and the panel in different places so that the entrances and exits would not look as awkward. In addition, before the third show, Heller requested an hour rehearsal for the camera crew with mock panelists and contestants. That rehearsal gave the camera operators a better \\"feel\\" for how the show should go. At the end of the third show, Dr. Montenier called CBS and, according to Heller, said, \\"I don't know what you did to it, but I'll buy it.\\" For the next eight years, either as the sole or alternating sponsor, Stopette was the advertising face of What's My Line? Bennett Cerf explained of Montenier that What's My Line? \\"ruined the poor man.\\"Interview of Bennett Cerf by Robbin Hawkins for the Columbia University Libraries Oral History Research Office, Session 16, January 23, 1968. Transcript p. 730 http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/nny/cerfb/audio_transcript.html Cerf said that when What's My Line? first started, none of the big companies wanted to sponsor the program. He said that everyone thought the program would last for a few months and die out, but the program \\"caught fire\\" in the ratings.Id at p. 730 Cerf noted that as the program spread from city to city, its advertising costs continued to rise accordingly. Montenier was very proud of the program, but he refused to have a co-sponsor. According to Cerf, Montenier stuck with What's My Line? until the program ruined him. At its peak, What's My Line? was running in nearly every city across the country. Cerf said that the advertising costs became so enormous that Montenier was unable to sell enough Stopette to make up for it. Eventually, Dr. Montenier was forced to sell out, and this, according to Cerf, broke his heart. When he died, according to Cerf, cartoons appeared with the caption, \\"Poof! There goes Dr. Montenier!\\" =Mystery Guest appearance= Montenier himself appeared on the February 12, 1956 episode of What's My Line? as a Mystery Guest. As he signed in, he was identified on screen as \\"Dr. Jules Montenier, Creator & Manufacturer of Stopette\\"; his \\"line\\" was \\"Our Sponsor (For Past Six Years).\\" Prior to their guesses, the panel was given the hint that Dr. Montenier was self-employed. The panel failed to guess Montenier's line correctly; he \\"stumped the panel and won the game,\\" as Mr. Daly's successor as moderator, Wally Bruner, preferred to phrase it. It turned out that the purpose for Dr. Montenier's visit was to give his belated congratulations to the show for its six years on television. Mr. Daly said that Dr. Montenier was a good sponsor because he refused to interfere with the production of the show. Dr. Montenier, in return, said that he loved the show and watched it each Sunday. Montenier remained seated during his entire appearance, after which the program went directly to a commercial; guests on the program customarily walked in and sat next to the host and walked to greet the panelists after their appearance. The audience was not given any explanation for this change, but some viewers would have read in the newspapers that Montenier had had his left leg amputated as the result of a car crash at the end of May 1954. His wife Helen had been killed in the same accident.The Chicago Tribune, May 29, 1954 and May 31, 1954 =Impact on time slot and broadcast markets= What's My Line? did not begin its life on Sunday nights. After Dr. Montenier's Stopette deodorant became the show's primary sponsor in March 1950, CBS moved the show from Thursdays at 8 to an alternating-week basis on Wednesdays at 9.TVgameshows.net Eventually, due largely to pressure to get higher caliber guests on the show, the show was moved back to 10:30 p.m. on Sunday nights. Since most Broadway plays closed at 10:00 p.m. at the time, this gave those actors plenty of time to get there. Dr. Montenier and his ad agency agreed with the move, and CBS agreed to reimburse the sponsor for viewers lost due to the move. Jules Montenier, Inc.'s sponsorship of What's My Line? caused nearly a third of the United States not to see the show until 1956. The reason was that the company's ad agency controlled the time slot and would not buy the slot in markets where Jules Montenier's products were not sold. Notable markets that were missing the show until the late 1950s included Columbus, Georgia; Tallahassee, Florida; Savannah, Georgia; Spartanburg, South Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; Memphis, Tennessee; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Meridian, Mississippi; and Lexington, Kentucky. In 1956, Jules Montenier, Inc. was sold to Helene Curtis Industries, Inc.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_kgy0stMiQ thereby giving the products a national market and thus enabling What's My Line? to be shown nationwide. Popular culture The Harvard Lampoon, forerunner of the National Lampoon, once had a picture of Montenier shooting through the top of a building, with the caption “Poof! There goes Dr. Montenier.” Of this, Cerf said of Montenier, \\"He was a sweet man—but a bit of a fraud, you know.\\"Interview of Bennett Cerf by Robbin Hawkins for the Columbia University Libraries Oral History Research Office, Session 16, January 23, 1968 http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/nny/cerfb/audio_transcript.html Company legacy In 1956, Jules Montenier, Inc. was sold to Helene Curtis. As Cerf noted, this broke Montenier's heart. In 1996, Helene Curtis was sold to Unilever, a large British-Dutch corporation,Helene Curtis Industries Inc which still held ownership of all Helene Curtis patents, trademarks, and copyrights as of August 2016.

Background After the coalition melted down, Ma Chao took the remainder of his army towards Lantian, where he could prepare a stand against Cao Cao. Unexpectedly, Su Bo in Hejian rebelled, and Cao Cao decided to lead his main army to quell the uprising, sparing Ma Chao the time to recuperate. Thus, Ma Chao gradually regained his strength, and once again wielded great influence over local non-Han people. To resist Cao Cao, Ma Chao had recruited many Qiang and Hu soldiers, and received reinforcements from Zhang Lu of Hanzhong. He had planned to conquer all counties in Longxi (west of Long Ridges), and within a year, all cities except Jicheng (capital of Tianshui Commandery) in the area surrendered to the allied force. The siege In 213, Ma Chao started to besiege Jicheng, but it proved to be difficult. Even though the Inspector of Liang Province, Wei Kang, faced a large numerical disadvantage, his assistant, Yang Fu, greatly encouraged the defenders by taking the lead in protecting the city. Yang Fu recruited around 1,000 scholars and clansmen to place under the command of his cousin, Yang Yue, and he himself acted as Yang Yue's strategist. Yang Fu told Yang Yue to set up the crescent moon formation atop the city wall to counter Ma Chao's siege and wait for reinforcements from the east. However, from the first month to the eighth month, there was no sign that a relief force was on its way, so Wei Kang sent his subordinate, Yan Wen, to sneak out under cover of darkness to get help from Xiahou Yuan, who was stationed at Chang'an. However, Yan Wen was caught by Ma Chao's soldiers, and Ma Chao tried to use the respected elder to his advantage. The warlord forced the captive to go to the city walls and tell the defenders that no help would come from Chang'an. However, the stubborn old man shouted, \\"A grand force from the east is coming, keep holding until they arrive!\\" For this Ma Chao asked Yan Wen whether the latter treasured his very own life, but Yan did not reply.Sanguozhi vol. 18. Since Ma Chao had been struggling to breach the city wall for a long time, he wanted to lure the influential Yan Wen to change allegiance, so he gave Yan Wen another chance, asking whether the latter knew anyone inside the city who would welcome the invaders, but the old man still remained silent. Now Ma Chao was irritated and censured the elder venomously, causing Yan Wen to finally stand up and say, \\"A gentleman serving a lord can die for him but not betray him, yet you desired an old man to conduct evil speeches! Am I a person who would rather live in shame?\\"(夫事君有死无贰，而卿乃欲令长者出不义之言，吾岂苟生者乎？) Sanguozhi vol. 18. Then, a speechless Ma Chao executed Yan Wen in rage. After witnessing the death of Yan Wen, however, both Wei Kang and the Administrator of Jicheng were terrified, and they hesitated to resist further. Although Yang Fu strongly opposed surrender, Wei Kang opened the city gates and let Ma Chao in. Once Ma Chao got inside the fortress-city, he arrested Yang Yue, and asked Zhang Lu's officer, Yang Ang (), to murder Wei Kang and the Administrator of Jicheng. Aftermath At the beginning of the siege, Cao Cao was fighting Sun Quan in Ruxukou, and after he returned to the city of Ye, he was busy launching the establishment of the principality of Cao Wei.Sanguozhi vol. 1. Therefore, he was too occupied to send reinforcements, and only in the eighth month did he let Xiahou Yuan lead a relief force to Jicheng. Not knowing the city had already fallen, Xiahou Yuan's unit ran into that of Ma Chao's 200 li outside of Jicheng, where Xiahou was defeated. Such a victory greatly impressed Qianwan, leader of the Di tribe, so the latter allied with Ma Chao, who now named himself General Who Conquers the West and Governor of Bing Province. By conquering Jicheng, Ma Chao had gained a base from which to command the majority of Liang Province and exert influence around the area. However, Ma Chao's success would not last long, as Yang Fu contacted some former officers of Wei Kang to rebel against Ma Chao simultaneously in the ninth month of 213. At the end, Ma Chao, Pang De, and his cousin Ma Dai fled Liang Province and took refuge under Zhang Lu. In popular culture The Siege on Jicheng is featured in Koei's video game Dynasty Warriors 5: Xtreme Legends and is called Battle of Ji Castle.

Materials with good machinability (free machining materials) require little power to cut, can be cut quickly, easily obtain a good finish, and do not wear the tooling much. The factors that typically improve a material's performance often degrade its machinability. Therefore, to manufacture components economically, engineers are challenged to find ways to improve machinability without harming performance. Machinability can be difficult to predict because machining has so many variables. Two sets of factors are the condition of work materials and the physical properties of work materials.Schneider, George, \\"Machinability of Metals,\\" American Machinist, December, 2009. The condition of the work material includes eight factors: microstructure, grain size, heat treatment, chemical composition, fabrication, hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength.Schneider, \\"Machinability.\\" Physical properties are those of the individual material groups, such as the modulus of elasticity, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, and work hardening. Other important factors are operating conditions, cutting tool material and geometry, and the machining process parameters. Quantifying machinability There are many factors affecting machinability, but no widely accepted way to quantify it. Instead, machinability is often assessed on a case-by-case basis, and tests are tailored to the needs of a specific manufacturing process. Common metrics for comparison include tool life, surface finish, cutting temperature, and tool forces and power consumption.Schneider, p. 8. =Tool life method= Machinability can be based on the measure of how long a tool lasts. This can be useful when comparing materials that have similar properties and power consumptions, but one is more abrasive and thus decreases the tool life. The major downfall with this approach is that tool life is dependent on more than just the material it is machining; other factors include cutting tool material, cutting tool geometry, machine condition, cutting tool clamping, cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut. Also, the machinability for one tool type cannot be compared to another tool type (i.e. HSS tool to a carbide tool). \\\\text{Machineability index (}\\\\%{)} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{cutting speed of material for 20 minute tool life}}{\\\\text{cutting speed of free-cutting steel for 20 minute tool life}} * 100 =Tool forces and power consumption method= The forces required for a tool to cut through a material is directly related to the power consumed. Therefore, tool forces are often given in units of specific energy. This leads to a rating method where higher specific energies equal lower machinability. The advantage of this method is that outside factors have little effect on the rating. =Surface finish method= The surface finish is sometimes used to measure the machinability of a material. Soft, ductile materials tend to form a built up edge. Stainless steel and other materials with a high strain hardening ability also want to form a built up edge. Aluminium alloys, cold worked steels, and free machining steels, as well as materials with a high shear zone don't tend to form built up edges, so these materials would rank as more machinable.Schneider, p. 9. The advantage of this method is that it is easily measured with the appropriate equipment. The disadvantage of this criterion is that it is often irrelevant. For instance when making a rough cut, the surface finish is of no importance. Also, finish cuts often require a certain accuracy that naturally achieves a good surface finish. This rating method also doesn't always agree with other methods. For instance titanium alloys would rate well by the surface finish method, low by the tool life method, and intermediate by the power consumption method.Schneider, p. 10. =Machinability rating= The machinability rating of a material attempts to quantify the machinability of various materials. It is expressed as a percentage or a normalized value. The American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) determined machinability ratings for a wide variety of materials by running turning tests at 180 surface feet per minute (sfpm). It then arbitrarily assigned 160 Brinell B1112 steel a machinability rating of 100%.Schneider, p. 5. The machinability rating is determined by measuring the weighted averages of the normal cutting speed, surface finish, and tool life for each material. Note that a material with a machinability rating less than 100% would be more difficult to machine than B1112 and material with a value more than 100% would be easier. Machinability Rating= (Speed of Machining the workpiece giving 60min tool life)/( Speed of machining the standard metal) Machinability ratings can be used in conjunction with the Taylor tool life equation, VT^n = C, in order to determine cutting speeds or tool life. It is known that B1112 has a tool life of 60 minutes at a cutting speed of 100 sfpm. If a material has a machinability rating of 70%, it can be determined, with the above knowns, that in order to maintain the same tool life (60 minutes) the cutting speed must be 70 sfpm (assuming the same tooling is used).Degarmo, p. 542. Steels The carbon content of steel greatly affects its machinability. High-carbon steels are difficult to machine because they are strong and because they may contain carbides that abrade the cutting tool. On the other end of the spectrum, low-carbon steels are troublesome because they are too soft. Low-carbon steels are \\"gummy\\" and stick to the cutting tool, resulting in a built up edge that shortens tool life. Therefore, steel has the best machinability with medium amounts of carbon, about 0.20%. Chromium, molybdenum and other alloying metals are often added to steel to improve its strength. However, most of these metals also decrease machinability. Inclusions in steel, especially oxides, may abrade the cutting tool. Machinable steel should be free of these oxides. =Additives= There are a variety of chemicals, both metal and non-metal, that can be added to steel to make it easier to cut. These additives may work by lubricating the tool-chip interface, decreasing the shear strength of the material, or increasing the brittleness of the chip. Historically, sulphur and lead have been the most common additives, but bismuth and tin are increasingly popular for environmental reasons. Lead can improve the machinability of steel because it acts as an internal lubricant in the cutting zone. Since lead has poor shear strength, it allows the chip to slide more freely past the cutting edge. When it is added in small quantities to steel, it can greatly improve its machinability while not significantly affecting the steel's strength. Sulphur improves the machinability of steel by forming low shear strength inclusions in the cutting zone. These inclusions are stress risers that weaken the steel, allowing it to deform more easily. =Stainless steel= Stainless steels have poor machinability compared to regular carbon steel because they are tougher, gummier and tend to work harden very rapidly. Slightly hardening the steel may decrease its gumminess and make it easier to cut. AISI grades 303 and 416 are easier to machine because of the addition of sulphur and phosphorus. Aluminium Aluminium is a much softer metal than steel, and the techniques to improve its machinability usually rely on making it more brittle. Alloys 2007, 2011 and 6020 have very good machinability. Other materials Thermoplastics are difficult to machine because they have poor thermal conductivity. This creates heat that builds up in the cutting zone, which degrades the tool life and locally melts the plastic. Once the plastic melts, it just flows around the cutting edge instead of being removed by it. Machinability can be improved by using high lubricity coolant and keeping the cutting area free of chip build up. Composites often have the worst machinability because they combine the poor thermal conductivity of a plastic resin with the tough or abrasive qualities of the fiber (glass, carbon etc.) material. The machinability of rubber and other soft materials improves by using a very low temperature coolant, such as liquid carbon dioxide. The low temperatures chill the material prior to cutting so that it cannot deform or stick to the cutting edge. This means less wear on the tools and easier machining.

Jeff Leopard's first show was in Boone, North Carolina, on October 1, 1983. Other North Carolina bands on that bill were N.R.G, Antiseen and Fetchin Bones. O'Keefe tried out for the lead guitar player of Antiseen in 1984, but it never came to be. \\"I was too broke to afford an amp\\", O'Keefe stated in a mid-1990s Antiseen interview. Judas Bullethead was the spinoff of Jeff Leopard. O'Keefe recorded it as Judas Leopard, his Jeff Leopard stage name. Clayton recorded as \\"Bullethead\\" an old nickname given to him by Joe Young. \\"If they Itch, Scratch Em\\" was released in 1987 and reviewed in Spin in 1987. All instruments were played by Clayton and O'Keefe, even though neither was a drummer. The follow- up \\"Honest, It's just a Cold Sore\\", was released in 1988. \\"Honest\\" was recorded with a lot of studio musicians, including members of the band Black Acid Disco. After Judas Bullethead played a few shows, the band released \\"The King is Dead / Oh Baby\\" in 1989 and went on hiatus. A long talked about \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD is still a possibility. O'Keefe officially joined Antiseen in 1988 and recorded the Blood of Freaks EP. Antiseen recorded over 20 records during the early 1990s. The band toured Europe three times and played concerts all over the US, including a cancelled show in Los Angeles on the day of the LA Riots. After a very short stint as the band's manager, he stopped playing in Antiseen in the fall of 1995.  Tour manager  O'Keefe first worked as a tour manager with Lustre in 1996. (Antiseen drummer Greg Clayton was the drummer of Lustre.) After Lustre was dropped by A&M; Records, O'Keefe worked with D Generation, Whiskeytown, Stir, Mandy Moore and Tonic. O'Keefe started tour-managing Train as their debut CD Train was just hitting. Since 1999, Train has played hundred of concerts in the US, Canada, South America, Europe and Australia. He also toured with Rockstar Supernova in 2007 with Johnny Colt, Lucas Rossi, Gilby Clarke and Tommy Lee. Train finished its 2.5-year- long tour for the Save Me, San Francisco CD in December 2011. On that tour, Train performed 350 concerts in 30 countries, ending with a show in Guangzhou, China on December 10, 2011. After 13 years, O'Keefe quit working with Train in September 2012 and moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he worked at Crush Management Nashville Office. He worked with Ashley Monroe and Striking Matches. In 2014, as the Crush Nashville office closed, O'Keefe went back to tour managing, working with Sia, Dashboard Confessional and Third Eye Blind. O'Keefe is currently the tour manager for Weezer.

It was completed in 1951 for the Mellon National Bank and the U.S. Steel Corporation. At tall, it was the second-tallest building in Pittsburgh until 1970, and the third-tallest until 1984. The building has 41 floors and approximately of office space. Presently it is the third-largest office building by square feet in downtown Pittsburgh. In 2016, BNY Mellon sold the building for $67.65 million. History 525 William Penn Place was one of the first skyscrapers built in Pittsburgh as part of longtime Mayor David Lawrence's Renaissance I building initiative to rebuild downtown Pittsburgh. The building was built by the then Pittsburgh Pirates owner John W. Galbreath with loans from the Mellon National Bank and additional financing from insurance companies.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gdQMAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=P2oDAAAAIBAJ&dq;=nixon%20theater&pg;=1569%2C1947481 At the time of construction, Mellon purchased floors 2-8 by deed in 1951 from John W. Galbreath. The building was designed by Harrison & Abramovitz with construction by the Turner Construction Company.W.L. Russell, “Work on Mellon- US Steel Skyscraper Starts April 1”, The Pittsburgh Press, March 27, 1949 It was built on the site of the Henry Hotel which was demolished to prepare the site for the tower in 1949.http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi- bin/chronology/chronology_driver.pl?q=&year;=&month;=4&day;=11&start;_line=0&searchtype;=single&page;=sim The original plan for the building was to construct the ground floors in the same architectural design as the Mellon National Bank on Smithfield Street adjacent to the skyscraper and to allow open flow of Mellon employees between the two buildings with Mellon occupying the first eight floors. This plan was later modified during construction to give the entire building its own modernist style and an open shared lobby with three elevator banks and multiple passages between the skyscraper and the Mellon National Bank on Smithfield Street. U.S. Steel leased the floors 9 through 37 for their corporation and various subsidiaries. The top floors were reserved for the T. Mellon & Sons Company, various Mellon family charities offices, and a penthouse for philanthropist Richard King Mellon. U.S. Steel was the primary tenant until completing their own skyscraper, U.S. Steel Tower, on Grant Street in 1970. At that time, Mellon Bank owned floors 2-8 and leased the remainder of the building from the John W. Galbraith Co.William Allen, “Mellon Taking Over Skyscraper”, The Pittsburgh Press, Aug 2, 1970 In April 1982, Mellon Bank finally purchased the remainder of the building for $10 million.Allegheny County Real Estate Tax Website Mellon Bank (The Bank of New York Mellon since 2007) remained the owner of 525 William Penn Place and the largest occupier of space at approximately half the building (approximately 500,000 square feet). The remainder of the space is leased to various businesses and law firms with Citizens Bank as the largest tenant occupying approximately 250,000 square feet (1/4 of the building). Citizens Bank also leases from Mellon signage rights to the building which include the right to erect signage at the top of the tower and above the entry closest to Fifth Avenue.Pittsburgh Business Journal In January 2015, BNY Mellon announced it would begin slowly moving employees to other space in downtown Pittsburgh and seek a buyer for the building.Pittsburgh Post-Gazette In September 2016 BNY Mellon, National Association sold it to FAC 525, LLC (a single purpose entity) for $67.65 million. Renovations The first major building renovation of 525 William Penn Place occurred from 1986 to 1987 with a complete building renewal. New windows (approximately 3,344), heating, air, plumbing, and new mechanical systems were installed. In 2001, a new renovation commenced with the complete rebuilding of the lobby, building entrances, elevator cabs, and restrooms. The building was awarded an Energy Star label in 2008 for its operating efficiency. In 2010, the building was further awarded a Gold Level LEED certification by the US Green Building Council.Costar Building name Wall mural painting in the anteroom to the 41st floor former Mellon Executive Board room, 525 William Penn Place. Mural depicts Pittsburgh Point in 1849 as reproduced from a painting by B.F. King. Being primarily a bank office building and due to the ever changing banking industry, the name of the building has often been in confusion. Originally known as 525 William Penn Place from construction until 1970, it was then named the Mellon Bank Center. It was renamed again in 1984 with the completion of One Mellon Bank Center two blocks away with the designation of Three Mellon Bank Center (later Three Mellon Center). In 2002 it reverted to the original name of 525 William Penn Place with Mellon's sale of its retail banking business to Citizens Bank. Interesting facts There are many short distance elevators located throughout the building. For example, four small capacity elevators exist that provide service only between floors two through eight. Two more elevators exist for service only between floors 38 - 41. In the basement garage, accessible by vehicles from Oliver Avenue for deliveries, exists a working vehicle turntable. Trucks can enter, unload, and then be \\"turned around\\" by operating the turntable to exit the building. There is a tunnel that runs between 525 William Penn Place and One BNY Mellon Center on Grant Street, running under the Union Trust building. This tunnel connects all three buildings and while not open to the public, remains in use by building staff and tenants.

SR 174 begins at a junction with in Leahy and travels eastward to Grand Coulee, near the Grand Coulee Dam, to intersect . From Grand Coulee, the roadway travels southeast to end at northwest of Wilbur. Prior to the establishment of SR 174 in a 1964 renumbering, it had been county roads and two highways, Secondary State Highway 10B (SSH 10B) and Secondary State Highway 4C (SSH 4C) from 1937 until 1964. The two highways merged to form SR 174 in 1964 and a branch of SSH 10B became the Crown Point spur of SR 174\\\\. A second spur route, located in Leahy, was added in 2009. Route description Washington State Route 174 SR 174 begins at an intersection with in Leahy, a small community in Douglas County. The western terminus is only accessible from SR 17 southbound, access from SR 17 northbound is provided by the Leahy spur of SR 174\\\\. From Leahy, the highway travels northeastward through grasslands with few farms before turning southeast to intersect its Crown Point spur near the Grand Coulee Dam. The roadway then enters Grant County and the city of Grand Coulee and becomes the Bridgeport Highway. SR 174 continues to the Grand Coulee Dam federal reservation and state maintenance ends through the area. After the gap in maintenance in Grand Coulee, SR 174 travels over the Columbia Basin Canal and intersects with , which is named Midway Avenue through Grand Coulee. After the intersection, the highway is named Grand Coulee Avenue and passes Grand Coulee Middle School and Skilskin High School before leaving the city and the county. The roadway enters Lincoln County and continues southeast to its eastern terminus, an intersection with , northwest of Wilbur; SR 21 continues south to intersect with (US 2). History SR 174 had previously been parts of various county roads until 1937, when Washington established a system of primary and secondary highways throughout the state. One of the secondary highways, Secondary State Highway 10B (SSH 10B) ran from (PSH 10) in Bridgeport to Coulee Dam, near the Grand Coulee Dam that was built in 1942. Another secondary highway, Secondary State Highway 4C (SSH 4C) ran from Grand Coulee to near Wilbur. In 1951, the western terminus SSH 10B was moved from Bridgeport to PSH 10 in Leahy and a western portion from in Farmer to PSH 10 in Mansfield. A branch of SSH 10B from its main route to the Crown Point viewing area of the Grand Coulee Dam was added in 1955. SR 174 was formed after a 1964 renumbering of Washington state highways, eliminating the previous Primary and secondary highway system. SSH 10B and SSH 4C were connected to become the new highway and the renumbering went into effect in 1970. In 2009, a second spur in Leahy was established and added to the state highway system. Major intersections Spur routes State Route 174 (SR 174) has two spur routes, a type of special route. =Leahy spur= The Leahy spur of SR 174 is a long two-lane spur route that was added to the state highway system in 2009. The roadway is named Leahy Road and serves as a connector from northbound to SR 174. =Crown Point spur= The older spur route is located near the Grand Coulee Dam and connects SR 174 to Crown Point State Park, part of the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area, within the community of Coulee Dam. The highway, named Crown Point Road, is long and was added in 1964. The Crown Point Spur was a spur route of SSH 10B, established in 1955, prior to 1964.

In the 4th century, Jerome reported that Saint Paula visited this location. Strong traditions from the Middle Ages buttress this claim, celebrating this town as the prophet's original home. A monastery of Joseph of Arimathea was erected there. Conflicting traditions urge Arimathea's location at modern Rantis, 15 miles east of Jaffa.

The Field Army (Oberbefehlshaber des Heeres) was separate from the Home Command (Heimatkriegsgebiet). The responsibilities of training, conscription, supply, and equipment were entrusted to the Home Command.Hogg, p. B2 In peacetime, the Wehrkreis was the home to the army corps of the same number and all subordinate units of that formation. The corps commander also commanded the Wehrkreis. Command of the Wehrkreis passed to the corps second-in-command at the outbreak of war. Before the start of the war, there were also four Motorized Army Corps (in effect, staffs to control the training of Panzer and Light Panzer formations). These had no corresponding military districts, but were served (as regards conscription and supplies) by the districts in which Corps headquarters or subordinate formations had their Home Garrison Stations. These Corps were: *XIV. Armeekorps (mot.) (\\"XIV Army Corps (Motorized)\\") *XV. Armeekorps (mot.) (\\"XV Army Corps (Motorized)\\") *XVI. Armeekorps (mot.) (\\"XVI Army Corps (Motorized)\\") *XIX.

Louis Tocqué, 1755, Portrait de Pierre de Jélyotte (Portrait of Actor as Apollo), oil on canvas, 82 × 72 cm (32.3 × 28.3 in), Hermitage Museum He often appeared at Court in Fontainebleau, where he sang Daphnis in Daphnis et Alcimadure by Jean-Joseph de Mondonville, and Colin in Le devin du village by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In 1755, he retired from the Opéra, singing in Castor et Pollux, but continued singing at court until 1765. He then joined the \\"Orchestre du Roi\\" (the King's Orchestra) as a violinist and guitarist, and later joined the private orchestra of Madame de Pompadour as a cellist, and wrote a few \\"comédies- ballets\\", notably Zeliska. He died, aged 84, in Oloron. Widely regarded as the \\"greatest singer of Europe\\" in his time, his voice type was then known as haute-contre, his voice was by all account powerful, and in some ways prefigured a new vocal type closer to the tenor as we know it today, opening the doors to a new style of singing, as Adolphe Nourrit and Gilbert Duprez would soon demonstrate.

It evolved from the frilling or ruffles decorating the front of a shirt in the 19th century.Caulfeild, S. F. A. Encyclopedia of Victorian Needlework, [Dictionary of Needlework]. A. W. Cowan, London, 1882, (facsimile edition, Dover Publications, NY, 1972) v. I A–L, p. 274. History In the 17th and 18th centuries, a jabot consisted of cambric or lace edging sewn to both sides of the front opening of a man's shirt, partially visible through a vest/waistcoat worn over it. This style arose around 1650. Jabots made of lace and hanging loose from the neck were an essential component of upper class, male fashion in the baroque period. In the late 19th century a jabot would be a cambric or lace bib, for decorating women's clothing. It would be held in place at the neck with a brooch or a sewn-on neckband. Today Public hearings of the International Court of Justice presided over by H.E. Judge Rosalyn Higgins (February/March 2006) Jabots survive in the present as components of various official costumes. The white bibs of judges of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany are officially described as jabots, as are those worn by judges and counsel throughout Australian courts. Jabots are prescribed attire for barristers appearing before the Supreme Court of South Australia. French magistrate court dress and French academic dress include a jabot, called rabat. It is usually of plain cotton, except that of academic high officials, which is made of lace. Jabots are worn by the judges and Advocates General of the Court of Justice of the European Union. In the United States Supreme Court, jabots are worn by some female justices, but are not mandatory. Both United States Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor often wear jabots with their judicial robes; Justice Elena Kagan, in contrast, does not. Ginsburg had a collection of jabots from around the world. She stated in 2014 that she had a particular jabot that she wore when issuing her dissents (black with gold embroidery and faceted stones), as well as another she wore when issuing majority opinions (crocheted yellow and cream with crystals) which was a gift from her law clerks. Her favorite jabot (woven with white beads) was from Cape Town, South Africa. The Speaker of the House of Commons traditionally wears a jabot along with a black silk and gold lace robe and lace cuffs when in ceremonial dress. Jabots continue to be worn as part of the highest formal Scottish evening attire and a former part of Scottish highland dance costumes from the 1930s to the 1970s. They are usually worn with high-necked jackets or doublets (Sheriffmuir or Montrose), often with matching cuffs for both genders and a fly plaid of the same tartan as the kilt, draped over-the-shoulder for men. Since the 1970s, a white jabot has been part of the blue and white concert costume of South Africa's Drakensberg Boys' Choir. The jabot is part of the vestment of a verger. The jabot is also part of the ceremonial uniform of girl Queen's Scholars at Westminster School.

The highway ends at a private gravel road and the roadway continues downstream as the Wawawai Road to Wawawai County Park. History The Wawawai area was a community for Chinese laborers working on nearby farms located on the Snake River, founded in 1875. The community was serviced by the Snake River Valley Railroad that connected Lewiston, Idaho to Washington state. The Wawawai Road was an unpaved dirt road by the 1960s, before the Port of Wilma was established and built. The highway from (US 410) in Clarkston through Wawawai and to west of Colton was signed as Secondary State Highway 3G (SSH 3G) in 1969. SSH 3G became SR 193 during a highway renumbering and was signed in 1970.

His sculptures in green soapstone of caribou and birds are particularly esteemed for their balance and delicacy. He was an early collaborator with James Archibald Houston, and by Houston's account was instrumental in the conception of the West Baffin Island Eskimo Cooperative. He was also one of the witnesses of the last-remembered traditional Inuit trial.Eber, Dorothy. (1997)Images of Justice: A Legal History of the Northwest Territories as Traced Through the Yellowknife Courthouse Collection of Inuit Sculpture. Ottawa: McGill-Queen's Press 1997. ,On Google Books Biography Caribou in soapstone, in the collection of the Dennos Museum Center =Youth and early work= Ipeelee grew up in a traditional Inuit environment, learning to hunt and fish from his father, Ohotok Ipeelee, at a small camp near Cape Dorset. Ohotok also taught his son how to carve ivory, and as early as the age of thirteen Osuitok began to sculpt. This was encouraged by Roman Catholic missionaries, who bought carvings and commissioned small crucifixes from him. The artist's earliest extant works are ivory miniatures of hunting equipment, typical of the historic period of Inuit art, that date from the 1940s. =James Houston and subsequent career= Before Houston's 1951 expedition, Ipeelee was already regionally known as the greatest carver on Baffin Island. Under Houston's influence he began to carve sculptures in soapstone, which had a reliable market in the south. Exhibits of Inuit art at the National Gallery of Canada in 1952 and 1955 included his work, crediting him as \\"Oshaweetuk B\\". With recognition he began to receive official commissions. In 1955 he directed a team of craftsmen in the creation of the official mace for the Council of the Northwest Territories, and in 1959 he was asked to create a sculpture of Queen Elizabeth II, which was presented to the Queen upon her visit to Canada that year. The birth of Inuit printmaking The idea of a Cape Dorset printmaking program developed from a winter 1957 conversation between Houston and Ipeelee. As Houston recalled: > Osuitok Ipeelee sat near me one evening studying the sailor-head trademarks > on a number of identical cigarette packages. He...stated that it must have > been very tiresome...to sit painting every one of the small heads on the > small packages with the exact sameness... My explanation was far from > successful...partly because I was starting to wonder whether this could have > any practical application in Inuit terms. Looking around to find some way to > demonstrate printing, I saw an ivory walrus tusk that Osuitok had recently > engraved... Taking an old tin of writing ink... with my finger I dipped into > the black residue and smoothed it over the tusk. I laid a piece of toilet > paper on the inked surface and rubbed the top lightly, then quickly stripped > the paper from the tusk. I saw that by mere good fortune, I had pulled a > fairly good negative of Osuitok's incised design. \\"We could do that,\\" he > said, with the instant decisiveness of a hunter. And so we did. James > Archibald Houston, Fifty years of Thinking it Over, from Celebrating Inuit > Art 1948–1970, ed. Maria von Finckenstein Despite this, Ipeelee only contributed a total of four prints to the annual print collections, two in 1958 and two in 1959. He never returned to the medium explaining that he had not been paid enough for the drawings on which the prints were based, and found sculpture to be more profitable.

The district comprises two city blocks of small homes on quarter-sized lots. These houses were built between 1884 and 1890 by William Ragan, a Minneapolis real estate speculator. Built for lower-income residents, the houses had deteriorated in condition by the end of World War II, and by the 1970s, were planned for demolition. A group of residents and concerned citizens fought to save the houses, eventually leading to their inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places and the federal protection and rehabilitation that comes with the designation. Today, the houses sit along a bike- and pedestrian-friendly mall on which motor traffic is prohibited.A People's History of the Seward Neighborhood edited by Wendy Epstein, Marilyn Matheny and Rick Musser, (Minneapolis: Nodin Press, 2018) pp. 199-216. Early history Residents of Milwaukee Avenue in the early decades of the 20th century During the late 19th century, the population of Minneapolis was growing rapidly, increasing 351 percent from 1880 to 1890. With the number of people moving into the city, lower-cost housing was needed for immigrants who were new to Minnesota. The street had originally been platted as an alley between 22nd and 23rd Avenues South, but William Ragan developed it as a street and labeled it 22½ Avenue. The houses were situated close together on narrow lots, with very narrow side yards and no front yards. This almost gives the impression of rowhouses. Most of the houses were built with brick veneer on timber frames, and they have uniform-sized roof slopes, modified flat arch windows, and open front porches. The street kept its '½' until 1906, when petitioners asked the Minneapolis City Council to change the street's name to Woodland Avenue because they said the '½' made them feel like they lived in an alley. For an unknown reason, the street's name was not changed to Woodland Avenue, but to Milwaukee Avenue. The Avenue's proximity to the Milwaukee Short Line Railroad has been suggested as a cause. Deterioration and restoration A Milwaukee Avenue house being restored By the time World War II was over, the houses on Milwaukee Avenue were falling into disrepair. They had been neglected throughout the Great Depression and wartime. In 1959, the City of Minneapolis presented a plan for the Seward neighborhood, which listed the houses on Milwaukee Avenue in 'deteriorated' condition, meaning they had no indoor plumbing or were severely battered. In many other neighborhoods, the City had renewed and thus gentrified areas without public hearings, because residents of those neighborhoods were low- income renters. In Milwaukee Avenue's case, however, the residents were of medium income, and seasoned protesters, since many had protested the Vietnam War. By 1970, the City of Minneapolis planned to raze the Milwaukee Avenue houses using funds from the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) program. The residents of Milwaukee Avenue and the surrounding Seward neighborhood formed the Seward West Project Area Committee (PAC) in order to try to save the Milwaukee Avenue homes. They argued that the houses had significant historic value and needed to be preserved. The City argued that the houses were legally nonconforming, and rehabilitating them would cost more than just building new houses. The City furthered its plan of renewing the area and took no heed of the PAC. In response, the PAC secretly submitted an application to the National Register of Historic Places for the Milwaukee Avenue district. It was approved on May 2, 1974 by Secretary of the Interior Rogers CB Morton. This meant that the City could not alter or destroy the houses using federal funds without a public hearing. Nine of Milwaukee Avenue's houses had to be destroyed due to their decrepit conditions and a tenth was moved elsewhere. In the spaces where these houses once stood, townhomes were built, mirroring the style of the original houses. The rest of the houses got indoor plumbing, new basements, improved woodwork and porches added on. Additionally, a pedestrian mall was built down the center of Milwaukee Avenue to replace a one-way street. The Avenue is now bike and pedestrian friendly, and cars are prohibited. Milwaukee Avenue today Milwaukee Avenue in winter Milwaukee Avenue still stands today. In 2007, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Milwaukee Avenue's rehabilitation, self-guided walking tours of eight of the houses were offered to the public. The houses were featured on local CBS station WCCO-TV's Finding Minnesota series in 2005. The two-minute video segment about the avenue featured interviews with a resident of Milwaukee Avenue, as well as Bob Roscoe, an activist who led the fight to save Milwaukee Avenue.

Common examples include grinding, honing, and polishing. Abrasive processes are usually expensive, but capable of tighter tolerances and better surface finish than other machining processes Mechanics of abrasive machining Abrasive machining works by forcing the abrasive particles, or grains, into the surface of the workpiece so that each particle cuts away a small bit of material. Abrasive machining is similar to conventional machining, such as milling or turning, because each of the abrasive particles acts like a miniature cutting tool. However, unlike conventional machining the grains are much smaller than a cutting tool, and the geometry and orientation of individual grains are not well defined. As a result, abrasive machining is less power efficient and generates more heat. The grain size may be different based on the machining. For rough grinding, coarse abrasives are used. For fine grinding, fine grains (abrasives) are used. Abrasive machining processes Abrasive machining processes can be divided into two categories based on how the grains are applied to the workpiece. In bonded abrasive processes, the particles are held together within a matrix, and their combined shape determines the geometry of the finished workpiece. For example, in grinding the particles are bonded together in a wheel. As the grinding wheel is fed into the part, its shape is transferred onto the workpiece. In loose abrasive processes, there is no structure connecting the grains. They may be applied without lubrication as dry powder, or they may be mixed with a lubricant to form a slurry. Since the grains can move independently, they must be forced into the workpiece with another object like a polishing cloth or a lapping plate. Common abrasive processes are listed below. = Fixed (bonded) abrasive processes = *Grinding *Honing, superfinishing *Tape finishing, abrasive belt machining *Abrasive sawing, Diamond wire cutting, Wire saw *Sanding = Loose abrasive processes = *Polishing *Lapping *Abrasive flow machining (AFM) *Hydro- erosive grinding *Water-jet cutting *Abrasive blasting *Mass finishing, tumbling Open barrel tumbling Vibratory bowl tumbling Centrifugal disc tumbling Centrifugal barrel tumbling Abrasives The most important property of an abrasive is its hardness. For abrasive grains to effectively cut, they must be significantly harder than the workpiece material. They can be grouped based on their hardness into two categories: conventional abrasives and superabrasives. Conventional abrasive materials have been used since the advent of machining. They are made of materials that exist naturally on Earth, and they are abundant and cheap. Conventional abrasives can suitably machine most materials. Superabrasives are much harder than conventional abrasives. Since they are much more expensive, they are used when conventional abrasives will not suffice. Common abrasives are listed below. = Conventional = *Aluminium oxide (Corundum) *Silicon carbide *Emery *Pumice *Sand *Steel abrasive = Superabrasives = *Diamond *Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN), Borazon References * Category:Machining ","title":"Abrasive machining"},{"id":"16722927","text":"In the statistical analysis of observational data, propensity score matching (PSM) is a statistical matching technique that attempts to estimate the effect of a treatment, policy, or other intervention by accounting for the covariates that predict receiving the treatment. PSM attempts to reduce the bias due to confounding variables that could be found in an estimate of the treatment effect obtained from simply comparing outcomes among units that received the treatment versus those that did not. Paul R. Rosenbaum and Donald Rubin introduced the technique in 1983. The possibility of bias arises because a difference in the treatment outcome (such as the average treatment effect) between treated and untreated groups may be caused by a factor that predicts treatment rather than the treatment itself. In randomized experiments, the randomization enables unbiased estimation of treatment effects; for each covariate, randomization implies that treatment-groups will be balanced on average, by the law of large numbers. Unfortunately, for observational studies, the assignment of treatments to research subjects is typically not random. Matching attempts to reduce the treatment assignment bias, and mimic randomization, by creating a sample of units that received the treatment that is comparable on all observed covariates to a sample of units that did not receive the treatment. For example, one may be interested to know the consequences of smoking. An observational study is required since it is unethical to randomly assign people to the treatment 'smoking.' The treatment effect estimated by simply comparing those who smoked to those who did not smoke would be biased by any factors that predict smoking (e.g.: gender and age). PSM attempts to control for these biases by making the groups receiving treatment and not-treatment comparable with respect to the control variables.  Overview  PSM is for cases of causal inference and simple selection bias in non-experimental settings in which: (i) few units in the non-treatment comparison group are comparable to the treatment units; and (ii) selecting a subset of comparison units similar to the treatment unit is difficult because units must be compared across a high-dimensional set of pretreatment characteristics. In normal matching, single characteristics that distinguish treatment and control groups are matched in an attempt to make the groups more alike. But if the two groups do not have substantial overlap, then substantial error may be introduced. For example, if only the worst cases from the untreated \\"comparison\\" group are compared to only the best cases from the treatment group, the result may be regression toward the mean, which may make the comparison group look better or worse than reality. PSM employs a predicted probability of group membership—e.g., treatment versus control group—based on observed predictors, usually obtained from logistic regression to create a counterfactual group. Propensity scores may be used for matching or as covariates, alone or with other matching variables or covariates.  General procedure  1\\\\. Run logistic regression: *Dependent variable: Z = 1, if unit participated (i.e. is member of the treatment group); Z = 0, if unit did not participate (i.e. is member of the control group). *Choose appropriate confounders (variables hypothesized to be associated with both treatment and outcome) *Obtain an estimation for the propensity score: predicted probability (p) or log[p/(1 − p)]. 2\\\\. Check that propensity score is balanced across treatment and comparison groups, and check that covariates are balanced across treatment and comparison groups within strata of the propensity score. * Use standardized differences or graphs to examine distributions 3\\\\. Match each participant to one or more nonparticipants on propensity score, using one of these methods: *Nearest neighbor matching *Caliper matching: comparison units within a certain width of the propensity score of the treated units get matched, where the width is generally a fraction of the standard deviation of the propensity score *Mahalanobis metric matching in conjunction with PSM *Stratification matching *Difference-in-differences matching (kernel and local linear weights) *Exact matching 4\\\\. Verify that covariates are balanced across treatment and comparison groups in the matched or weighted sample 5\\\\. Multivariate analysis based on new sample *Use analyses appropriate for non- independent matched samples if more than one nonparticipant is matched to each participant Note: When you have multiple matches for a single treated observation, it is essential to use Weighted Least Squares rather than Ordinary Least Squares.  Formal definitions  =Basic settings= The basic case is of two treatments (numbered 1 and 0), with N [Independent and identically distributed random variablesi.i.d] subjects. Each subject i would respond to the treatment with r_{1i} and to the control with r_{0i}. The quantity to be estimated is the average treatment effect: E[r_1]-E[r_0]. The variable Z_i indicates if subject i got treatment (Z=1) or control (Z=0). Let X_i be a vector of observed pretreatment measurement (or covariate) for the ith subject. The observations of X_i are made prior to treatment assignment, but the features in X_i may not include all (or any) of the ones used to decide on the treatment assignment. The numbering of the units (i.e.: i=1, ..., i=N) are assumed to not contain any information beyond what is contained in X_i. The following sections will omit the i index while still discussing about the stochastic behavior of some subject. =Strongly ignorable treatment assignment= Let some subject have a vector of covariates X (i.e.: conditionally unconfounded), and some potential outcomes r0 and r1 under control and treatment, respectively. Treatment assignment is said to be strongly ignorable if the potential outcomes are independent of treatment (Z) conditional on background variables X. This can be written compactly as : r_0, r_1 \\\\perp Z \\\\,\\\\, X where \\\\perp denotes statistical independence. =Balancing score= A balancing score b(X) is a function of the observed covariates X such that the conditional distribution of X given b(X) is the same for treated (Z=1) and control (Z=0) units: : Z \\\\perp X \\\\,\\\\, b(X). The most trivial function is b(X) = X. =Propensity score= A propensity score is the probability of a unit (e.g., person, classroom, school) being assigned to a particular treatment given a set of observed covariates. Propensity scores are used to reduce selection bias by equating groups based on these covariates. Suppose that we have a binary treatment indicator Z, a response variable r, and background observed covariates X. The propensity score is defined as the conditional probability of treatment given background variables: :e(x) \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\Pr(Z=1  X=x). =Main theorems= The following were first presented, and proven, by Rosenbaum and Rubin in 1983: * The propensity score e(x) is a balancing score. * Any score that is 'finer' than the propensity score is a balancing score (i.e.: e(X)=f(b(X)) for some function f). The propensity score is the coarsest balancing score function, as it takes a (possibly) multidimensional object (Xi) and transforms it into one dimension (although others, obviously, also exist), while b(X)=X is the finest one. * If treatment assignment is strongly ignorable given X then: :* It is also strongly ignorable given any balancing function. Specifically, given the propensity score: ::: (r_0, r_1) \\\\perp Z \\\\,\\\\, e(X). :* For any value of a balancing score, the difference between the treatment and control means of the samples at hand (i.e.: \\\\bar{r}_1-\\\\bar{r}_0), based on subjects that have the same value of the balancing score, can serve as an unbiased estimator of the average treatment effect: E[r_1]-E[r_0]. * Using estimates of the balancing score of units using the sample at hand can produce sample balance on X =Relationship to sufficiency= If we think of the value of Z as a parameter of the population that impacts the distribution of X then the balancing score serves as a sufficient statistic for Z. Furthermore, the above theorems indicate that the propensity score is a minimal sufficient statistic if thinking of Z as a parameter of X. Lastly, if treatment assignment Z is strongly ignorable given X then the propensity score is a minimal sufficient statistic for the joint distribution of (r_0, r_1). =Graphical test for detecting the presence of confounding variables= Judea Pearl has shown that there exists a simple graphical test, called the back-door criterion, which detects the presence of confounding variables. To estimate the effect of treatment, the background variables X must block all back-door paths in the graph. This blocking can be done either by adding the confounding variable as a control in regression, or by matching on the confounding variable.  Advantages and disadvantages  PSM has been shown to increase model \\"imbalance, inefficiency, model dependence, and bias\\" and is no longer recommended compared to other matching methods.  link to the full article (from the author's homepage) The insights behind the use of matching still hold but should be applied with other matching methods; propensity scores also have other productive uses in weighting and doubly robust estimation. Like other matching procedures, PSM estimates an average treatment effect from observational data. The key advantages of PSM were, at the time of its introduction, that by using a linear combination of covariates for a single score, it balances treatment and control groups on a large number of covariates without losing a large number of observations. If units in the treatment and control were balanced on a large number of covariates one at a time, large numbers of observations would be needed to overcome the \\"dimensionality problem\\" whereby the introduction of a new balancing covariate increases the minimum necessary number of observations in the sample geometrically. One disadvantage of PSM is that it only accounts for observed (and observable) covariates. Factors that affect assignment to treatment and outcome but that cannot be observed cannot be accounted for in the matching procedure. As the procedure only controls for observed variables, any hidden bias due to latent variables may remain after matching. Another issue is that PSM requires large samples, with substantial overlap between treatment and control groups. General concerns with matching have also been raised by Judea Pearl, who has argued that hidden bias may actually increase because matching on observed variables may unleash bias due to dormant unobserved confounders. Similarly, Pearl has argued that bias reduction can only be assured (asymptotically) by modelling the qualitative causal relationships between treatment, outcome, observed and unobserved covariates. Confounding occurs when the experimenter is unable to control for alternative, non-causal explanations for an observed relationship between independent and dependent variables. Such control should satisfy the \\"backdoor criterion\\" of Pearl.  Implementations in statistics packages  * R: propensity score matching is available as part of the \`MatchIt\` package. It can also easily be implemented manually. * SAS: The PSMatch procedure, and macro \`OneToManyMTCH\` match observations based on a propensity score. * Stata: several commands implement propensity score matching,Implementing Propensity Score Matching Estimators with STATA. Lecture notes 2001 including the user- written \`psmatch2\`. Stata version 13 and later also offers the built-in command \`teffects psmatch\`. * SPSS: A dialog box for Propensity Score Matching is available from the IBM SPSS Statistics menu (Data/Propensity Score Matching), and allows the user to set the match tolerance, randomize case order when drawing samples, prioritize exact matches, sample with or without replacement, set a random seed, and maximize performance by increasing processing speed and minimizing memory usage. The FUZZY Python procedure can also easily be added as an extension to the software through the Extensions dialog box. This procedure matches cases and controls by utilizing random draws from the controls, based on a specified set of key variables. The FUZZY command supports exact and fuzzy matching.

The game can be called Matgo () when only two players are playing. The game is derived from similar Japanese fishing games such as Hana-awase and Hachihachi, though the Japanese hanafuda game Koi-koi is in turn partially derived from Go-Stop. Modern Korean-produced hwatu decks usually includes bonus cards specifically intended for play with Go-Stop, unlike Japanese hanafuda decks. Typically there are two or three players, although there is a variation where four players can play. The objective of this game is to score a minimum predetermined number of points, usually three or seven, and then call a \\"Go\\" or a \\"Stop\\", where the name of the game derives. When a \\"Go\\" is called, the game continues, and the number of points or amount of money is first increased, and then doubled, tripled, quadrupled and so on. A player calling \\"Go\\" risks another player scoring the minimum and winning all the points themselves. If a \\"Stop\\" is called, the game ends and the caller collects their winnings.  Setup  In order to select a dealer, each player picks random cards from the deck and the person who chooses the earliest or latest month card becomes the dealer, depending on whether it is nighttime or daytime, with nighttime favoring the earliest month card, i.e. January, and the latest month card favored during daytime, i.e. December. (밤일낮장) Before the cards are dealt, the dealer shuffles the cards by holding the deck in the left hand with the cards face-down and pulling out random stacks of cards with the right hand to stack them on top. The dealer must repeat this process several times in order to shuffle the cards sufficiently. After shuffling, the dealer holds the deck out to the player to their left in order for them to cut the deck. If there are only two players, the opponent cuts the deck. = Deal = *Two players: The dealer places four cards face-up on the table then deals five cards to their opponent's hand and five cards to their hand. Then, the dealer places another four cards face-up on the table and deals another five cards to each player's hand, starting with the opponent. *Three players: The dealer places three cards face-up on the table then deals four cards to each player's hand, starting with the player to the right and continuing counterclockwise. Then, the dealer places another three cards face-up on the table and deals another three cards to each player's hand, again starting with the player on the right. The remaining cards are placed face down on top of the cut portion of the deck in the center of the table to form a draw pile. Before the play begins, the players check for sets of two, three or four cards of the same month on the table. If there is a set, they pile it up on top of each other, usually leaving space on each of the top part of the cards.  Gameplay  # Play begins with the dealer and continues counterclockwise. # A turn begins with a player attempting to match one of the cards lying face-up on the table with a card of the same month in their hand. If there are two cards of the same month already on the table, the player may select one of them. If the player has no cards matching the cards on the table, the player discards a card to the table. # The turn continues with the player flipping over the top card from the draw pile and looking for a card of the same month on the table. If the player locates a matching card on the table, the player collects both cards along with the cards matched in step 2. Otherwise, the drawn card is added to the table. # If the card drawn from the top of the draw pile in step 3 matches the two cards matched in step 2, the three cards remain on the table. This is known as ppeok. The three cards remain until a player collects them using the fourth card of the same month. # If a player draws a card which matches the card discarded in step 2, the player collects both cards as well as one junk card (pi) from each opponent's stock pile. This is known as chok. # If a player plays a card in step 2 for which two matching cards are already on the table, and then draws the fourth matching card from the draw pile in step 3, the player collects all four cards as well as one junk card (pi) from each opponent's stock pile. This is known as ttadak. # The object of the game is to create scoring combinations to accumulate points up to a score of either three (for three players) or seven (for two players), at which point a \\"Go\\" or a \\"Stop\\" must be called. # A game that ends with neither a \\"Go\\" nor \\"Stop\\" call is called a Nagari game. The dealer and play order of the following game remain the same as with the Nagari game, and when the game ends, the loser owes double money to the winner.  Additional rules  *Any player who has a set of three cards of the same month in their hand can show them to the other players in what is referred to as “shaking” the cards, or heundeum. For each time a player shakes within a single hand, final points are doubled in the event that that player wins the hand. *If a player has a set of three cards of the same month in their hand and the fourth card of that month is located on the table, the player may play all three cards in one turn and collect all four cards as well as one junk card (pi) from each player's stock pile. This is known as a poktan (meaning \\"bomb\\"). Shaking the cards before playing a poktan is also an option. A player who has played a poktan may then choose to skip step 2 above in as many as two turns (i.e. the player's turn consists only of drawing one card from the draw pile). *Any player who has a set of four cards of the same month can show them to the other players and win the hand immediately. *If there is a set of three cards of the same month on the table, they are combined into one stack. The player who collects the pile using the fourth card of that month will also collect one junk card (pi) from each player's stock pile. *If there is a set of four cards of the same month on the table, the cards are reshuffled and redealt by the same dealer. *If there is a bonus card on the table during initial deal, the dealer collects the bonus card and turns the top card of the draw pile face-up and places it on the table. *If a player is dealt a bonus card, they may add it to their stock pile at the beginning of any turn and draw a card from the draw pile to replace it in their hand. *If a player draws a bonus card from the draw pile during their regular turn, they will automatically collect it along with any other cards matched during that turn, except in the event of a ppeok, in which all four cards (i.e. the three cards involved in the ppeok plus the bonus card) must remain on the table. *Player can show down when player have the others' win-card. The card that when other player get, others win the game is called win-card. Next player ask \\"Will you receive show down?\\" in the direction of progress. If next player says \\"No\\", player lay down another player's win-card. If everyone says \\"Yes\\", the game will be Nagari game.  Point system  There are several ways to collect points in Go-Stop. * Bright cards (gwang): One way to accumulate points in Go-Stop is to collect Bright cards (gwang). When three gwang other than that of the month of December (referred to as bi gwang, bi meaning “rain”) are collected, this is known as “Three Brights” (sam gwang) and is worth three points. However, if the Three Brights include bi gwang, this is called “Wet Three Brights” (bi sam gwang), and is worth two points. When four gwang are collected, this is called \\"Four Brights\\"(sa gwang) and is worth four points. It does not matter whether 'bi gwang' is included in \\"Four Brights\\" or not. When all five gwang are collected, this is called “Five Brights” (o gwang) and is worth fifteen to fifty points depending on house rules. * Ribbon cards (tti): Another way to accumulate points is through Ribbon cards. A set of any five Ribbon cards is worth one point, and each additional Ribbon card after five is worth one additional point. For example, a set of six Ribbon cards is worth two points and a set of seven Ribbon cards is worth three points. In addition to this, points may also be accumulated by collecting three matching Ribbon cards. There are three blue Ribbon cards (cheong dan), three red Ribbon cards with poetry (hong dan), and three red Ribbon cards without poetry (cho dan) (this excludes the Ribbon card for the month of December, which is also red and without poetry). Each of these combinations is worth three points. Moreover, the two methods of accumulating points via Ribbon cards are combined. If a player collects six Ribbon cards, including all three red Ribbons and all three blue Ribbons, the player can claim three points for hong dan, three points for cheong dan, and an additional two points for having six Ribbon cards, for a total of eight points. * Animal cards (kkeut): A third way to accumulate points is by collecting Animal cards. The scoring system of Animal cards is quite similar to that of Ribbon cards. A set of any five Animal cards is worth one point, and each additional Animal card after five is worth an additional one point. For example, a set of six Animal cards is worth two points, and a set of seven Animal cards is worth three points. In addition to this, if among the Animal cards, a special set of three cards made up of the Geese, the Cuckoo and the Nightingale is collected, this set is called godori (meaning “five birds”) and is worth five points (even though the Animal card from the month of December also features a bird, it is excluded as with the Bright cards and the Ribbon cards). Both methods of scoring are combined, as with the Ribbon cards. Thus, if a player collects six Animal cards, including godori, the player can claim five points for godori, and two additional points for having six Animal cards, for a total of seven points. * Junk cards (pi) The fourth and most common way to accumulate points is by collecting junk cards. Any set of ten junk cards is worth one point and each additional card after ten is worth an additional one point. In addition, there are special junk cards called Double Junks (ssang pi), which are counted as two junk cards. Also, the bonus cards mentioned above are also usually counted as two junk cards. When a player accumulates at least three (for three players) or seven (for two players) points, the player must decide if they will continue that hand by calling “Go,” or end the hand by calling “Stop.” If a player says “Go\\" once, the player must increase their score by at least one point in order to be given another opportunity to call “Go” or “Stop.” A player who calls “Go” once has one point added to their final score. With two “Go”s, two points are added. With the third “Go,” the score is doubled. After the third “Go” (in which the score is multiplied by two), the score is multiplied by the number one less than the number of times the winner has called “Go.” However, before calling “Go,” the winner must consider whether another player may increase their score to at least three or seven points within the next turn. When “Stop” is called, any non-winning players who have called \\"Go\\" will have their penalty (calculated from the winning player's total points) doubled. This is called go bak. If a non-winning player has no Bright cards when the winner has accumulated points by collecting Bright cards, the player without Bright cards will have their penalty doubled. This is known as gwang bak. Further, if a non-winning player has fewer than six junk cards and the winner has accumulated points by collecting junk cards, the non-winning player will have their penalty doubled. This is known as pi bak. All of these are cumulative. As an example, if a player accumulates seven or more points through only Ribbon cards and Animal cards, the player may then call \\"Go.\\" If, however, before the first player is given another opportunity to call \\"Go\\" or \\"Stop\\" another player accumulates at least seven points through both Bright cards and junk cards and subsequently calls \\"Stop,\\" the first player would be subject to go bak, gwang bak and pi bak. Thus, the player's penalty would be doubled three times, in other words, multiplied by eight.  Gambling  The game is commonly used as a light form of gambling. Though the game can be played without money being involved, the game is considered more entertaining with the gambling aspect included, with households commonly playing at 100 Won (~0.09 USD) per point. However, any amount can be assigned to the point. The game is played with great caution outside of the family household, if ever played, as the gambling aspect brings in distrust through cheating, including the hiding of cards and the introduction of foreign cards to improve a hand, as common examples.

Schmidt (1881Gado, Mark. 2006. Killer Priest: The Crimes, Trials, and Execution of Father Hans Schmidt. Westport, CT: Greenwood, p. 5. – February 18, 1916) was a German Roman Catholic priest convicted of murder, and the only priest to be executed in the United States. Early life Aschaffenburg, Kingdom of Bavaria, German Empire, the birthplace of Father Hans Schmidt. Hans Schmidt was born in the Bavarian town of Aschaffenburg, to a Protestant father and a Catholic mother. Both sides of his family had a long history of mental illness. From his early childhood, Hans was regularly beaten by his father and watched his father beating his mother. Even in childhood, Schmidt combined a deep religious devotion with bisexual promiscuity and a fascination with drinking blood and dismembering animals. According to relatives, Hans once beheaded two of his parents' geese and kept the severed heads in his pocket. He also frequented the village slaughterhouse daily, where he would watch the death and dissection of farm animals with rapt fascination.Gado (2006), pages 4–11. During his later seminary studies, Schmidt was arrested by the Bavarian police in 1905 and charged with forging diplomas for failing students. Although the public prosecutor of Mainz was determined to send Schmidt to prison, his father hired a lawyer who arranged for the charges to be dropped for reasons of mental defect.Mark Gado (2006), pages 13–15. Ordination Bishop Georg Heinrich Maria Kirstein, the Roman Catholic bishop who supposedly ordained Schmidt to the priesthood in Mainz, Germany, on December 23, 1904 Saint Elizabeth of Hungary Although all who knew him had serious doubts about his moral and mental fitness to serve as a Catholic priest, Schmidt claimed that he was ordained by Bishop Kirstein of Mainz on December 23, 1904. In a later conversation with Manhattan alienists, he recalled, \\"The Bishop ordained me alone. I do not like to speak of it. The real Ordination took place the night before. St. Elizabeth, she ordained me herself. I was praying at my bedside when she appeared to me and said, 'I ordain you to the priesthood.' There was light during her appearance. I told no one. I thought it best to keep it to myself. They would make fun of me. They always made fun of me for these things. They always expect others to do as they do. God speaks to different people in different ways.\\"Gado (2006), p. 15. During parish assignments in the villages of Burgel and Seelingstadt, Schmidt molested altar boys, had affairs with several women, and consorted with prostitutes. Meanwhile, Schmidt's creative way of saying Mass and eccentric sermons led his parishioners and fellow priests to complain about him to the monsignor and the bishop.Gado (2006), pp. 15–17.Polenberg, Richard. The World of Benjamin Cardozo: Personal Values and the Judicial Process, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. When it became clear that no further parish assignments would be forthcoming in the Diocese of Mainz, Schmidt emigrated to the United States in 1909. He was first assigned to St. John's Roman Catholic Church in Louisville, Kentucky. There, a rift with the senior pastor resulted in Schmidt's transfer to St. Boniface's Church in New York City. Anna Aumüller Anna Aumüller In New York City in 1912, Schmidt met Anna Aumüller, the housekeeper at the Rectory of St. Boniface's Church, who had emigrated from the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1910. In his conversations with alienists, Schmidt claimed to have heard a voice from God ordering him to \\"love\\" Anna. She first refused his advances, but eventually began having a secret sexual relationship with Schmidt.Gado (2006), pages 144–146. Beginning in December 1912, Schmidt was also having a secret homosexual relationship with a New York City dentist named Ernest Muret, with whom he operated a counterfeiting ring. Schmidt later claimed to have enjoyed Muret more than Anna.Gado (2006), pages 143–144. Despite his subsequent transfer to St. Joseph's Church in Harlem, Schmidt and Anna continued a secret sexual relationship. It was later revealed that they were \\"married\\" in a secret ceremony, which Schmidt performed himself. Schmidt also wrote their names on a marriage certificate and told Anna that he was about to leave the priesthood for her. During a sexual encounter with Anna on the high altar of St. Joseph's Church, Schmidt received what he claimed was a command from God to \\"sacrifice\\" her. The command was repeated so insistently that Schmidt told Anna, who called him \\"crazy\\".Gado (2006), pp. 144–145. Soon after, Anna informed him that she was pregnant. On the night of September 2, 1913, Schmidt went to the apartment they had rented while posing as a married couple. He slashed Anna's throat while she slept, drank her blood, raped her as she bled to death, dismembered her body, and threw the pieces from a ferry into the Hudson River.Michael H. Stone, M.D. & Gary Brucato, Ph.D., The New Evil: Understanding the Emergence of Modern Violent Crime (Amherst, N.Y.: Prometheus Books), pp. 458-459. . Schmidt then returned to St. Joseph's Church, offered Mass and administered Holy Communion as though nothing had happened.Gado (2006), pp. 131–149, 161–168. Police investigation After pieces of Anna's torso washed ashore at Cliffside Park and Weehawken, New Jersey,Gado (2006), pp. 49–60. Hudson County police detectives found a price tag still attached to the pillowcase used to wrap part of the body. Using the tag, the pillowcase was traced to a Newark factory, which sold exclusively to Manhattan furniture dealer George Sachs. The investigation was then taken over by the New York City Police Department and assigned to Manhattan Chief of Detectives Joseph Faurot.Gado (2006), page 61-63. After arriving at George Sachs' furniture store at 2782 Eighth Avenue, Inspector Faurot found the dealer unable to recall how many of the pillowcases he had sold. A check through his receipts revealed that a bedspring, a mattress, pillows, and pillowcases had been sold on August 26, 1913. The buyer had given his name as A. Van Dyke and had arranged for his purchases to be delivered to a third story apartment at 68 Bradhurst Avenue.Gado (2006), p. 63. Schmidt Questions to the building superintendent revealed that apartment was occupied by a married couple. The husband was described as a man with a heavy German accent who had given his name as H. Schmidt. When a three-day stake out revealed no one arriving, Inspector Faurot ordered detective Frank Cassassa to break into the apartment. A cursory search found that the floor had been recently scrubbed, but large amounts of dried blood were found on the walls. A large bloodstained knife was also found on the kitchen shelf. Men's clothing with the name A. Van Dyke sewn into the lining was found, as were letters in both German and English addressed to a Hans Schmidt.Gado (2006), pages 63–67. Many of the letters were from women in Germany. The largest number, however, were from an Anna Aumüller whose most recent address was listed as 428 East Seventieth Street. Inspector Faurot and detectives Cassassa and O'Connell visited the address and learned that Anna had moved out after receiving a job as housekeeper at St. Boniface's Church. Faurot and the detectives then visited St. Boniface's Church and were told by the senior pastor, Fr. John Braun, that Anna had been his housekeeper, but had transferred to St. Joseph's Church. Upon being asked if he knew the name Hans Schmidt, Fr. Braun described him as a priest who had formerly been assigned to St. Boniface's Church but had also moved to St. Joseph's.Gado (2006), pages 67–69. Inspector Faurot and detectives Cassassa and O'Connell arrived at St. Joseph's Rectory at 1:30. After Faurot pounded on the door, the senior pastor, Fr. Daniel Quinn, opened the door, led them into the parlor, and woke Schmidt. Upon being confronted by the inspector and the detectives, Schmidt admitted, \\"I killed her! I killed her because I loved her!\\" Schmidt then described the murder and dismemberment in detail. As his fellow priests watched in horror, Schmidt was taken into police custody.Gado (2006), pages 71–78. Trials, appeals, and execution A man being strapped into the electric chair at Sing Sing prison in the early 20th century A media spectacle ensued, as the New York papers competed against each other with an ever greater degree of sensationalism regarding the case. Following his arrest, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York announced that Fr. Schmidt's priestly faculties had been indefinitely suspended. During Schmidt's first trial, Schmidt feigned insanity. On top of his defense team using Schmidt's claims of hearing voices to try to convince the jury of their client's insanity, the defense also claimed that insanity ran in Schmidt's family. They called one witness, a psychologist named Smith Ely Jeliffe, to testify that Schmidt's family tree showed up to sixty near or distant relatives who displayed signs of mental instability, and therefore, Schmidt could not be put to death because he, too, was insane. The prosecution called in other witnesses, including doctors, who had examined Schmidt while he awaited trial and concluded that contrary to his efforts to convince authorities otherwise, and contrary to Schmidt's ramblings about voices telling him to commit murder against Aumüller, Schmidt was sane. However, the prosecution's efforts were in vain; at the conclusion of the trial in December 1913, the jury could not come to a decision after deliberating for several days, so he had a hung jury. The second trial occurred approximately two weeks later. This time, however, the prosecution introduced testimony that, in April of 1913; well before Fr Schmidt received his alleged command from God to \\"sacrifice\\" Anna, Fr. Schmidt had convinced a woman named Bertha Zech to pose as Anna Aumüller and to purchase a $5000 life insurance policy under her name. The policy listed Fr. Schmidt as the sole beneficiary. Mark Gado (2006), pages 152-156. On February 5, 1914, after three hours of deliberation, a jury found Fr. Schmidt guilty of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to death. After being sentenced, Fr. Schmidt said \\"I'm satisfied with the verdict. I would rather die today than tomorrow.\\" Mark Gado (2006), page 159. Fr. Schmidt was then sent to Sing Sing Prison to await execution. Schmidt's defense team filed an appeal shortly after his sentence, which postponed his execution for at least a year while it worked its way through the courts. In December 1914, Schmidt admitted that he feigned insanity during his trials. In admitting so, however, he also pinned the murder on the dentist with whom he had a homosexual affair, Ernest Muret. Dr. Muret, Schmidt alleged, had accidentally killed Anna during a botched abortion. Fr. Schmidt further claimed that he allowed authorities to pursue him for the murder rather than Muret because he wanted to cover for his friend. Schmidt's appeals were ultimately unsuccessful. On the early morning of February 18, 1916, Fr. Schmidt entered the death chamber at 5:50 AM. Moments before being seated in the electric chair, Fr. Schmidt said, \\"I want to say one word before I go. I beg forgiveness of all I have offended or scandalized and I forgive all who have offended against me!\\" Mark Gado (2006), pages 202-203. Moments before the switch was thrown, Fr. Schmidt said in a muffled voice, \\"My last word is to say goodbye to my dear old mother!\\" Mark Gado (2006), page 203. The first jolt of electricity was initiated at 5:52 AM. After two additional jolts were administered, the prison physical pronounced Fr. Hans Schmidt dead at 5:58 AM. Mark Gado (2006), page 203. A reporter for the Albany Times later wrote, \\"His last night on earth he spent proclaiming his innocence and declaring that he had made peace with God. The guards had expected a scene when the slayer was to be executed. But his actions surprised them. He was the coolest man in the death chamber. He almost domineered those who assisted in putting him to death.\\" Mark Gado (2006), page 204. The Schmidt family had originally intended to ship Fr. Schmidt's body home to Germany. However, due to the ongoing nature of World War I, this proved impossible. As a result, Fr. William Cashin, the Sing Sing prison Roman Catholic chaplain, arranged for burial in New York State. At the request of Fr. Schmidt's family in Germany, the location of his burial was kept secret. Mark Gado (2006), page 204. Other possible crimes Apart from killing his young, pregnant \\"wife\\", further investigation revealed that Schmidt had a second apartment where he had set up a counterfeiting workshop. Authorities also suspected Schmidt of the murder of Alma Kellner (aged 9) whose body was found buried in the basement of St. John's church in Louisville, Kentucky, where Schmidt had previously worked. The body had been burned, but authorities suspected the killer had initially tried to dismember her. The janitor, Joseph Wendling, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the murder based on circumstantial evidence and bloody clothing found at his house.

The highway serves to connect Lakeland Village and Medical Lake to the county seat of Spokane. The highway has existed since at least 1931, and before the 1964 state highway renumbering, it was numbered Secondary State Highway 11D. Between 1,600 and 9,200 vehicles used the highway on an average day in 2009.  Route description  SR 902 begins at exit 264, a diamond interchange, on the concurrent Interstate 90 (I-90)/U.S. Route 395 (US 395) in western Spokane County. The road travels northwesterly through sparsely populated light woodlands, passing west of a small lake, before turning north. The highway then passes Lakeland Village, an educational facility for the mentally disabled, before reaching the city of Medical Lake. The highway passes through western Medical Lake and Medical Lake High School before turning east at Brooks Road. The highway passes over a rail line belonging to the Eastern Washington Gateway railroad, before leaving Medical Lake city limits. The road continues northeast, clipping the southern border of Fairchild Air Force Base before intersecting the concurrent I-90/US 395 at exit 272. Every year, Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2009, WSDOT calculated that as few as 1,600 vehicles used the highway at the western terminus, and as many as 9,200 vehicles at the eastern terminus.  History  The first roadway linking now I-90/US 395 and Medical Lake first appeared on maps in 1931. By the 1933 map, the remainder of the highway was present, linking back to I-90/US 395. Before the 1964 state highway renumbering, SR 902 was numbered Secondary State Highway 11D, a branch of Primary State Highway 11, the predecessor to US 395 through the region.

The ProRodeo Hall of Fame inducted the Greeley Stampede in 2014. History The Greeley Stampede is rich in tradition and heritage dating back to the late 1800s. By 1920, the Stampede was the largest fair or festival in the world. This community celebration that was started to honor local potato farmers, has since grown into an internationally acclaimed festival attracting close to 450,000 people annually from all parts of the United States and several foreign countries, including Canada, Mexico, and England. The Greeley Stampede is the 2nd largest fair in Colorado, and features one of the largest rodeos in the world. Officially christened the Greeley Spud Rodeo in 1922, the event featured bucking bronc riding, fancy roping, a pie eating contest, a horse race, motorcycle and bicycle races and a two-mile Model-T Ford \\"free for all\\" race. Estimated attendance in that first official festival was 2,500 people. In an effort to give the event some national recognition the Greeley Spud Rodeo era ended and, thus began the age of the \\"Go West with Greeley\\" Rodeo. The name taken from the famous phrase by the city's name sake, Horace Greeley, who said \\"Go west young man. Go west.\\" The Greeley Independence Stampede entitlement came in 1972 by means of a community contest and featured: Pro Rodeos; kids' rodeo; country and classic rock concerts; a televised July 4 parade, a demolition derby, carnival midway, western art show, free stage entertainment, mixed with food and fun. Controversy In 2003, the Stampede Committee announced that the event would adopt the name Rocky Mountain Stampede. Stampede Committee Chairman Lew Hagenlock explained, \\"The event has grown to a point were it is recognized as a regional and national event... we felt it should be named accordingly. We're excited to begin a new era in the event's history.\\" Many within the community; however, saw this as an advance move aimed at moving the event to the recently completed Larimer County Fairgrounds and Events Complex, also known as The Ranch in Loveland, Colorado. Due to the resulting public outcry, the Stampede Committee ultimately decided to change the name to Greeley Stampede in 2005.

The 8-acre island is roughly lozenge-shaped, with an elongation at its southwestern end. The Cooke Castle is located east of the geographic center of the island, and is the easternmost of the buildings on the island. It is three stories in height, built out of stone with wooden trim. Its most prominent feature is a four-story octagonal tower, topped with a Gothic Revival crenellated parapet. The single-story front porch is also topped by crenellations, with rounded-arch openings flanked by square columns. The interior features elaborate woodwork, with a fine marble fireplace in the parlor. The island was purchased by Jay Cooke in 1865, and the house was built soon afterward. Cooke, a native of Sandusky, had played a pivotal role in financing the war effort Union side in the American Civil War, selling near one billion dollars of war bonds to large and small buyers alike. He regularly spent time here after building the house, typically spending three weeks in the spring, and again in late summer.

In 2009, he joined Korean team Daejeon Citizen but returned to Brazil due to personal problems. He played with ABC-RN when the club won the state league Campeonato Potiguar de Futebol in May 2010. In July 2010 he moved for Maltese pitches joining Tarxien Rainbows F.C. After two seasons, he moved to Costa Rican giants Deportivo Saprissa. = ÖSK = Joining his teammates at August 2003, Ricardo played over 50 matches with the club's shirt and scored 11 goals with 16 assists on his records during the 2003, 2004 and 2005 seasons. The technical football style of the Brazilian/Italian player was appreciated from the club's fans since his first appearances. = Tarxien Rainbows = In July 2010, it was announced that Ricardo had signed a contract with Maltese Premier League club Tarxien Rainbows where he played alongside his former Corinthians teammate Everton. On the Rainbows, he played 55 official matches, scored 22 goals with 21 assists on his records. = Deportivo Saprissa = Ricardo moved to Saprissa for the Winter Tournament (Torneo de Invierno) playing 4 matches from start and scoring 3 goals with 4 assists on his records. His first goal was against Puntarenas FC when, after being away from the team for a month due to an immigration process delay, he entered as a substitute and at the 88th minute, headed the ball home after a perfect corner by Jose Carlos Cancela and scored the winning goal. The match finished 2–1. His second goal was against Uruguay FC, with a hard raising shot at the second half scoring the 2–0. He was again the hero when he entered at the 86th minute and scored the winning goal against San Carlos at the National Stadium of Costa Rica. He scored a very nice kick-over goal (chilena) when playing the farewell match of one of Saprissa icons, Alonso Solis. It was the first of the two goals he scored that night.

Biography Bassani was born in Padua. It is thought that he studied in Venice under Daniele Castrovillari and in Ferrara under Giovanni Legrenzi. Charles Burney and John Hawkins claimed he taught Arcangelo Corelli, but there is no solid evidence for this assertion. He was an organist at the Accademia della Morte in Ferrara from 1667, but had probably left by 1675. He published his first music in 1677; the title page calls him maestro of music at the Confraternità della Morte in Finale Emilia, not far from Modena. He was maestro di cappella at Duke Alessandro II della Mirandola's court in 1680, and was elected principe at the Accademica Filarmonica in Bologna. He became maestro di cappella at the Accademia della Morte in Ferrara in 1683, and then maestro di cappella at Ferrara Cathedral in 1686. For his contributions to the musical life of Ferrara, he was often called \\"Bassani of Ferrara\\". He wrote 76 liturgically ordered services for use at Ferrara Cathedral between 1710 and 1712. He became director of music at Santa Maria Maggiore in Bergamo in 1712, and also taught at the Congregazione di Carità in the same city until his death. Bassani was a celebrated violinist in his own time, and his fame was compounded by Burney's praise for him. His trio sonatas are his best-known and most often performed pieces in modern times. He wrote 13 oratorios, but only four survive, and all 13 of his operas have been lost aside from a few arias from Gli amori alla moda.

Background Jonathan Dawson was born in Melbourne. At Melbourne University he graduated in English Honours and won awards for acting and two One Act Playwriting Competitions (The World Record Club Award). Published many poems and short stories and, later, as a poetry performer.was often accompanied by guitarist Glen Tomassetti at La Mama. His play, A Cup of Tea with Mrs Groom was performed at La Mama directed by Graeme Blundell. He also created two of the most successful university revues of the decade (1960s).After graduating, Dawson joined the Australian Broadcasting Commission as a Trainee Radio and TV Producer/Director and directed many radio dramas and education programmes as well as dramas and documentaries. He left the ABC to join Crawford Productions as a writer director on Homicide and later Division 4. He then went on to Channel 9 in Sydney to direct The Link Men and write for other series including Rush and The Box. He continued to publish poetry and short stories, but left the full-time film industry to set up the new media studies department and screenwriting courses at the University of Canberra, leaving there to help set up Griffith University's Foundation Year in 1975 where he worked to create the then new screen studies and production courses now internationally acknowledged, a series of pioneering new degree and postgraduate programmes that have produced and mentored many of the leading film scholars and film makers in international screen studies today. Jonathan Dawson had two children: Patrick (born 1 February 1971) and Olivia (born 8 October 1972). He lived and wrote full-time in Hobart, Tasmania with his wife, fashion designer and writer, Felicity Dawson. On 10 August 2013, Dawson died after a long battle with illness. 1960s, 1970s work In the 1960s, Dawson wrote key policy essays (Overland (literary journal) etc.) on setting up a film industry, as well as becoming Victorian Chair of Australian Writers Guild on a platform of strong lobbying for local industry. He also began his parallel career as a public speaker and theorist on media and film policy issues, lecturing widely in the United Kingdom and Ireland. While in Canberra he was appointed Art Director for the ground breaking 36 screen audio visual, forerunner of contemporary 'public installation' works, at the Australian Pavilion for Expo '74 in Spokane, Washington. At this time he also began reviewing films for the ABC. He also wrote a weekly crime and thriller review column in The Canberra Times (1972–75), and still reviews crime, thriller and cinema reference books in the Hobart Mercury (2000–2010). Dawson continued to work as a writer director, primarily on commercials for clients like Qantas, Nestle, Volvo, as well as for many government election campaigns, creating a new style of \\"presidential\\" launch for the Federal Labor Party's successful national campaigns in 1983 and 1985 as well as directing TV commercials for Premier Neville Wran in New South Wales. 1980s, 1990s, and beyond Dawson wrote and directed documentaries and documentary specials for the ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) and commercial networks and the feature film Ginger Meggs in 1982. He was appointed to the ABC's first National Advisory Council after the Incorporation of the ABC in 1983, serving for three terms until 1990. While on the Council, he produced many papers for working parties on various programme areas and audiences as well as helping prepare and edit the new ABC Charter produced by the ABC Board. He has continued to present papers and publish widely on Public Broadcasting and the ABC as well as convening and addressing rallies supporting the ABC and ABC staff. In addition to teaching film and media studies he continued to publish critical essays and present learned papers at symposia and conferences internationally, with a particular and critical focus on empire building in film bodies and government policy along with many essays on Public Broadcasting. He published and co edited several books on film and the media including the Oxford University Press *Screenwriting in 2000. As a film maker who welcomed emerging writers, directors and students on his film shoots, he made contributions to the growing film industry of the 1970s right through to his pro bono political commercials on his retirement to Tasmania. With his 1980 Film Australia documentary The Myth Makers,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389187/ and later the Japan Prize-awarded TV Open Learning series Images of Australia,(Australian Broadcasting Corporation), Dawson opened up debate in the 1990s on national identity and the interconnected effects of literature, painting, cartooning, film, propaganda and the arts to constructing and projecting national self-images. This work later translated into many national university programs as well as several national TV series, on SBS (Special Broadcasting Service) and the ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) following up the intellectual leads sketched in all his earlier work as a teacher and film maker. At Griffith University, after eight years as Vice Chair of the School of Humanities, he helped plan and then headed up the multi campus Film School (now the Griffith Film School, serving as the School's Foundation Chair and Associate Professor until his retirement in 2000. From 1972 he had also been a film reviewer for the ABC and occasionally commercial and radio and TV, hosting his own Film TV programme, Cuts, on ABC TV Queensland from 1975. A remarkable number of his students are now active in Universities from the Sorbonne to UCLA and work in the film industry worldwide. After retiring to Tasmania, Dawson created a radio film chat show on ABC Radio with Tim Cox as well as writing for the ABC website and contributing popular weekly podcasts on film and popular culture. As Honorary Research Associate at the University of Tasmania he also introduced contemporary cinema studies courses. He continued to give many public lectures, addressing the Royal Australian Institute of Architects annual awards as Keynote Speaker (2004) on film and architecture as well as creating a series of new adult education courses on screenwriting and contemporary film. In association with Screen Tasmania and The State Cinema he has curated and lectured on film theory and history, hosting movie seasons with themes from Independent Movies to new French Film, Australian Film and Documentary. His regular audiences for these short lecture/film screenings include government ministers, department heads and many film professionals. He also wrote a weekly popular culture column (2002–05) and contributes regular book reviews to the Hobart Mercury and contributes key essays, Metro,http://www.metromagazine.com.au/index.html Screen Education and for the online journal sensesofcinema , voted (2007) by The Times as the world's finest international online film journal and contributing major essays to the Dartmouth Medal award-winning Concise Encyclopedia of the Documentary Film by Ian Aitken, Routledge/Taylor & Francis (2006) . In November 2009, he was elected an Honorary Life Member of the Australian Cinematographer's Society .

Biography =Early life= Demuth was born in Croydon, Surrey. On leaving Repton School in 1915, he volunteered as Rifleman No. 2780 with the 5th London Regiment (London Rifle Brigade) in the City of London on 17 September 1915, falsifying his age by adding one year on enlistment to seek active-service for which he was then under-age. In early March 1916 he was sent to France with a reinforcement draft to the Regiment's 1st Battalion on the Western Front, and was wounded in the leg by shrapnel fragments from the accidental detonation of a Mills Bomb on 28 June 1916 in the frontline village of Hebuterne during the prelude of the Battle of the Somme. He was medically evacuated to England and subsequently discharged from the British Army as medically unfit for further war service in November 1916. In Forgotten Voices of the Great War, Demuth is quoted as saying: > \\"Almost the last feather I received was on a bus. I was sitting near the > door when I became aware of two women on the other side talking at me, and I > thought to myself, 'Oh Lord, here we go again'. One lent forward and > produced a feather and said, 'Here's a gift for a brave soldier. I took it > and said,'Thank you very much- I wanted one of those.' Then I took my pipe > out of my pocket and put this feather down the stem and worked it in a way > I've never worked a pipe cleaner before. When it was filthy I pulled it out > and said, 'You know, we didn't get these in the trenches', and handed it > back to her. She instinctively put out her hand and took it, so there she > was sitting with this filthy pipe cleaner in her hand and all the other > people on the bus began to get indignant. Then she dropped it and got up to > get out, but we were nowhere near a stopping place and the bus went on quite > a long way while she got well and truly barracked by the rest of the people > on the bus. I sat back and laughed like mad.\\"Max Arthur, Forgotten Voices of > the Great War (London: Random House, 2012). 18–22 =In between the World Wars= Although Demuth studied for a time at the Royal College of Music under Thomas Dunhill and Walter Parratt, also receiving much encouragement from the Bournemouth conductor Dan Godfrey, he was essentially self-taught. His orchestral piece Selsey Rhapsody was one of his first compositions to be noticed. It was first performed by the London Symphony Orchestra under Adrian Boult in 1925. Further performances followed, mostly outside of London in the South East of England, where he was active as a conductor or orchestral and choral societies. Between 1929 and 1935 Demuth was conductor of the Chichester Symphony Orchestra. From 1930 he taught at the Royal Academy of Music, and latterly at the University of Durham. Among his pupils was Gordon Langford, whose surname was originally Colman (and who changed the name on Demuth's advice).Interview with Gordon Langford at musical-theatre.net. Retrieved 2 April 2008 Other pupils included King Palmer, Hugh Shrapnel and Bob Simans. =World War II= Demuth was active in the Home Guard and received a commission with the rank of lieutenant in the British Army on 23 October 1942.

Retrieved 1 December 2016 During this period he also wrote a series of handbooks on military strategy, including Harrying the Hun: A Handbook of Scouting, Stalking and Camouflage (1941) , and A Manual of Street Fighting. Music and writing Greatly sympathetic to French music, Demuth wrote a number of books on the subject. The first two, on Albert Roussel and Maurice Ravel, both appeared in 1947. Further books on César Franck, Charles Gounod, Vincent d'Indy, French Piano Music and French Opera were published over the following fifteen years. His Musical Trends in the 20th Century (1952) took a broader focus, though its judgements on German and American music are largely unsympathetic.Reviewed by Marion Bauer in Notes, September 1952, p 611-12 In a scathing review in Tempo, Hans Keller, noting the hostility towards Teutonic music (especially the British emigré composers), observes that \\"Mr Demuth's all too transparent personal prejudices come into play\\" and feels obliged to sign himself off with the words \\"The present writer is an Austrian-born British Jew\\".Tempo, No 24, Summer 1952, p 37-8 The French preference is evident in his own compositions, of which there were many. Demuth produced nine symphonies between 1930 and 1957, six operas between 1947 and 1959 (including Volpone, 1949, and The Orestia, 1950), and numerous orchestral ballets, concertos and overtures, works for military band, chamber music and songs, as well as much incidental music written for BBC radio plays. His orchestral set of Ravel-inspired Valses graves et gaies were premiered at the Proms in 1942 (postponed from 1940). Mason characterises his melodic style as somewhat austere, \\"in which definable tunes have little part\\", and his harmony as ranging from intense late Romantic Franckian chromaticism (the Threnody for strings of 1942) to more brittle Stravinskian neoclassicism (Overture for a Joyful Occasion, 1946). The Viola Concerto (1951) received its first performance in 1956 with Herbert Downes as soloist.Radio Times, Issue 1725, 2 December 1956, p 25 Hugh Ottaway said of the work \\"Designed in two linked sections, one slowish, the other quick, it made an impression through its capable workmanship and sense of purpose but did not offer much of imaginative distinction. A certain monotony of rhythm and texture was acutely felt, especially in the opening section, which is a rather busy meditation whose concertante viola part is inclined to fuss and fidget.\\"Hugh Ottaway, in 'Broadcast Music', The Musical Times, Vol. 98, No. 1368 (Feb. 1957), p. 78 Demuth wrote his Processional Fanfare for three trumpets and organ for the enthronement of the Lord Bishop of Chichester in 1958. Death Demuth married the pianist and teacher Edna Marjorie Hardwick in November 1943.The Times, 17 November 1943, p 7 She died in March 1965.Musical Times, June 1965, p 460 He died three years later in Chichester at the age of 69.Obituary, The Times, 22 April 1968 His pupil Gordon Langford has expressed regret at the complete current neglect of Demuth's achievements as a composer.

History The station was originally assigned the KWRU call sign by the FCC on February 16, 1988; it was to be a not-for-profit community radio station. When funding for the venture failed, it was acquired by Ketchum Radio, which built it out as commercial station KECH-FM and signed it on November 21, 1988. Ketchum Radio was a partnership headed by local resident Chris Haugh, and staff members including Larry Mott, Michael Hess (aka Dallas Dobro), and others, with Gary Stivers handling the news duties. Disc jockeys included Rob Hunter, Sadie Word, and other local talent. The call letters were chosen as a result of a contest, where listeners were asked to pick the call sign for the station. One listener chose KECH (short for the neighboring town of Ketchum). The listener won an all-expenses-paid trip to Belize. In 1994, Ketchum Radio sold the station to another local operator, Scott Parker's Alpine Broadcasting, Ltd., who owned/operated the station for ten years as its flagship (first) station. Alpine, also based in Ketchum, went on to grow to a-ten station group, then sold most of its stations to Chaparral Broadcasting, Inc.

His collection of drawings were bought for George III of Great Britain and form a nucleus of the Royal Collection of drawings in the Print Room at Windsor Castle.See Frances Vivian, The Consul Smith Collection: Masterpieces of Italian Drawing from the Royal Library, Windsor Castle, Raphael to Canaletto. The other nucleus of Windsor drawings comprises the drawings collected by Cardinal Alessandro Albani, purchased through the agency of Robert Adam's brother James. Smith the collector Joseph Smith, a man of obscure origins, was educated at Westminster School before travelling to Venice. Smith took up residence in 1700 in the import-export trade and merchant banking house of Thomas Williams, the British consul; he eventually headed the partnership of Williams and Smith and made a modest fortune.Horace Walpole remarked of him in passing as \\"The Merchant of Venice\\", who knew nothing of his books save their titlepages, but the bon mot seems undeserved, according to the original 1897 Dictionary of National Biography, s.v. \\"Smith, Joseph\\". \\"This collection was especially rich in the classics and in examples of early printing,\\" the British Library observes (British Library: \\"The printed books of King George III\\" ) which are two outstanding symptoms of books collected as trophies. On the other hand the catalogue of his library has an Appendix which reprints in full some 200 prefaces, dedications and epilogues contained in incunabula, a mark of genuine curiosity. His reputation was as a passionate collector,\\"His mania for collecting eventually reached such proportions that Carlo Goldoni dedicated an appropriate new comedy of the carnival season of 1750 to him – La famiglia dell' antiquario\\", notes William Barcham, \\"Canaletto and a Commission from Consul Smith' The Art Bulletin 59.3 (September 1977:383–393) p. 385 note 9. of paintings and drawings – both of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century masters and of living artists – and of manuscripts and books, coins and medals, and engraved gems.The gems were catalogued by Antonio Francesco Gori, and published in a sumptuously illustrated volume, Dactyliotheca Smithiana (1767, after Gori's death), after more than half the collection had been purchased on behalf of George III. Beside Canaletto, among the living painters whom he patronised were Francesco Zuccarelli, of Florence, and the Venetian Giuseppe Zais. His favoured architect for rebuilding the façade of his palazzo was Antonio Visentini. Smith and the Pasquali press It was his pleasure to issue lavishly-printed books in extremely limited editions, for which he had the services of Giovanni Battista Pasquali, whose press he bankrolled.Pasquali's only contemporary rivals among the presses of Venice were Albrizzi and Zatta. A reproduction of Boccaccio's Decamerone from the Pasquali press, guided by Smith, was so exact a facsimile of the rare edition of 1527 that only close examination tells them apart. A Catalogue Librorum Rarissimorum\\"Catalogue of extremely rare books\\". was in fact a partial catalogue of the outstanding rarities in Smith's own library; the first edition consisted of twenty-five copies.DNB A second edition (1737) adds thirty-one titles. A general catalogue of his library was published in 1755.Bibliotheca Smithiana, seu Catalogus Librorum D. Josephi Smithii Angli (Venice 1755). Smith's patronage Smith's central role in the network of patronage of painters in eighteenth-century Venice, in which he created a market in the taste for vedute, was as the prime facilitator of purchases made by the British aristocrats passing through on the Grand Tour. As the agent for Canaletto for several years circa 1729–35, he virtually controlled the artist's output, to the benefit of both; it was Smith who arranged for Visentini to engrave thirty-eight of Canaletto's views in 1730,Issued with a title page Urbis Venetiarum Celebriores and the date 1736 but under way in 1730, as F.J.B. Watson showed, \\"Notes on Canaletto and His Engravers-II\\" The Burlington Magazine 92 No. 573 (December 1950:351–354) p. 351. and Smith who encouraged the artist to make his successful trip to London in 1746. Smith himself was a passionate collector of contemporary Venetian painting and drawings, of etchings and engravings. In 1768 he published a facsimile of the original edition of Andrea Palladio's I quattro libri dell'architettura of 1570. In 1762 Smith sold the vast majority of his books, gems, coins, prints, drawings and paintings – including many works by Canaletto – to the young George III for £20,000. The books today form the nucleus of the King's Library, now transferred from the British Museum to the British Library, while the Royal Collection retains his other treasures. Musical Smith Smith's other passion was for music, which he indulged in part by marrying the noted but temperamental soprano Catherine Tofts (c.1685–1756). She had been the first true prima donna in London, who had introduced Italian opera in Thomas Clayton's Arsinoe, Queen of Cyprus (1705), the first Italian-style opera heard in England, and Bononcini's Trionfo di Camilla (1706), and who arrived in Venice in 1711, where Smith immediately made her his wife. Capricco of Mereworth Castle (cropped at right), by Antonio Visentini and Francesco Zuccarelli, commissioned by Consul Smith, 1742 (Royal Collection) \\"Consul\\" Smith His appointment as British consul was gazetted on 24 March 1743, Old Style (1744 by modern dating), after which he was the \\"Consul Smith\\" whose name appears in every history of eighteenth-century British collecting and art patronage. He retained the post until the accession of George III in 1760. In expectation of his appointment Smith purchased outright the Palazzo Balbi on the Grand Canal, which he had heretofore been renting, on 20 April 1740. Soon thereafter he commissioned Antonio Visentini to redesign the façade in the Palladian style. Smith, who was in correspondence with the \\"architect earl\\", Lord Burlington, was as devoted to Palladio as any of his British visitors: in the 1740s he asked Canaletto (whose agent he had been for many years) to paint the principal buildings by Palladio in Venice. A production of the Pasquali press was a facsimile of Andrea Palladio's Quattro libri dell'Architettura, as it had been printed in Venice, 1570, but presented as an eighteenth-century bibliophile felt it ought to have been printed in the first place, on fine paper with generous margins and engravings substituted for the original woodcuts. Further neo-Palladian structures in a veduta ideata fantasy setting commissioned by Consul Smith are the series of eleven paintings commissioned in 1746Seven of the eleven bear the date \\"1746\\". from Francesco Zuccarelli and Antonio Visentini showing English Palladian structures in idealised fantasy settings.Anthony Blunt, \\"A neo-Palladian programme executed by Visentini and Zuccarelli for Consul Smith,\\" The Burlington Magazine 100 (1958:283–84). Smith's summer villa in the terraferma was at Mogliano Veneto; it does not survive. Dispersing the collections George III began to form his library by purchasing Smith's in virtually its entirety in 1765, for £10,000; they form that part of the British Library known as the \\"King's Library\\".British Library: \\"The printed books of King George III\\" Smith did not stop collecting: the dispersal of his second collection of books by auction in London, took thirteen days in January–February 1773.The auctioneers were Baker & Leigh, precursors of the auction firm Sotheby's. Many of Smith's paintings also went to the British Royal Collection, through the mediation of James Smart Mackenzie, brother of Lord Bute.A King's Purchase: George III and the Collection of Consul Smith, exhibition catalogue The Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace The collection is celebrated for its dazzling series of Venetian views by Canaletto, together with other Italian views by Canaletto and works by Sebastiano Ricci, Francesco Zuccarelli and Pietro Longhi. On a more workaday level, there are numerous architectural drawings of sixteenth- century architecture at Venice and at Vicenza made in the studio of Antonio Visentini that are scaled in British feet and must have been intended for some British milordo.Noted by Paul Davies and David Hemsoll, \\"Sanmicheli through British eyes\\", in John Bold and Edward Chaney, eds., English Architecture, Public and Private: Essays for Kerry Downes. 1993:123. A generous selection of his manuscripts were purchased by Lord Sunderland for the library at Blenheim Palace, which was dispersed in turn in the nineteenth century. Legacy At quite an advanced age, the widowed consul Smith, his wife having died in 1746, married a sister of John Murray, resident at Venice and afterwards British ambassador to Turkey. His grave was on the Lido, where Goethe, travelling in the late seventeen-eighties, stopped to pay respects: \\"to him I owe my copy of Palladio, and I offered up a grateful prayer\\".Goethe, Italian Journey 1786–1788, W. H. Auden and Elizabeth Mayer, translators, (New York) 1962:81. Smith's Palladio was also the choice of New York's Beaux-Arts architectural firms at the end of the nineteenth century. The palace that he owned in Venice is now known as Palazzo Smith Mangilli Valmarana.

The station was owned by Metals Broadcasting Co. and featured programming from Westwood One. KWAL was unique because it was the only AM antenna array that had an interstate highway running through it.http://www.fybush.com/site-of-the-week-10262012-kwal- wallace-idaho/ The station broadcast in C-QUAM AM stereo. On April 9, 2016, the north tower collapsed after a pickup truck struck a guy wire. The station was granted authority to operate at 250 watts during nighttime hours using the south tower only. The FCC granted them the opportunity giving them a two-year deadline to rebuild the tower. KWAL failed to rebuild the north tower; consequently, they were forced to shut down. News and weather anchor John Webb signed the station off of the air on August 31, 2018 at 11:59 pm. The station's license was surrendered to the FCC for cancellation on November 4, 2019, and eventually cancelled by the FCC on February 13, 2020. History In 1938, KWAL filled the Silver Valley with air waves. In 1948, KWAL's frequency changed from 1450 kHz to 620 kHz, and its power increased from 250 Watts to 1 kilowatt. At that time, the station was a Mutual affiliate, licensed to Silver Broadcasting Company. Music format KWAL was renowned for their Hot New Country & Your All Time Favorites. Music was played 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year. They were affiliated with Westwood One, who supplied them with music via satellite. thumb News format KWAL broadcast national news at the top of the hour. 5 minutes later, it cut into local news, delivered by John Webb.

Timeline Several descriptions of illness resembling those of chronic fatigue syndrome have been reported for at least 200 years. In the 19th century, neurologist George Miller Beard popularised the concept of neurasthenia, with symptoms including fatigue, anxiety, headache, impotence, neuralgia and depression. This concept remained popular well into the 20th century, eventually coming to be seen as a behavioural rather than physical condition, with a diagnosis that excluded postviral syndromes. Neurasthenia has largely been abandoned as a medical diagnosis. The ICD-10 system of the World Health Organization now categorizes neurasthenia under (F48 Other neurotic disorders) which specifically excludes chronic fatigue syndrome. A United States Public Health Service (USPHS) official, Alexander Gilliam, described an illness that resembled poliomyelitis, after interviewing patients and reviewing records of one of several clusters which had occurred in Los Angeles, during 1934. The Los Angeles County Hospital outbreak included all or most of its nurses and doctors. Gilliam called the outbreak \\"atypical poliomyelitis\\" and described the symptoms as: rapid muscle weakness, vasomotor instability, clonic twitches and cramps, ataxia, severe pain (usually aggravated by exercise), neck and back stiffness, menstrual disturbance and dominant sensory involvement. There was a cluster of \\"encephalitis\\" cases in 1936, at a convent in Wisconsin, amongst novices and convent candidates. The following year two towns in Switzerland had outbreaks of \\"abortive poliomyelitis\\" , and 73 Swiss soldiers were given the same diagnosis in 1939. Outbreaks in Iceland were called \\"Akureyri disease\\" or \\"simulating poliomyelitis\\" and were later called \\"Iceland disease.\\" 800 people in Adelaide, Australia became ill during 1949–1951 with a disease \\"resembling poliomyelitis.\\" Two smaller clusters in the United States during 1950 were diagnosed as \\"Epidemic neuromyasthenia\\" and \\"resembling Iceland disease simulating acute anterior poliomyelitis.\\" Additional outbreaks of poliomyelitis-like \\"mystery diseases\\" occurred from the 1950s through the 1980s, in Denmark, the United States, South Africa, and Australia, among others. Several outbreaks of a polio-resembling illness occurred in Britain in the 1950s. A 1955 outbreak at the Royal Free Hospital Group was later called \\"Royal Free disease\\" or \\"benign myalgic encephalomyelitis\\". After the Royal Free Hospital outbreak, a disorder with similar symptoms was found among the general population and the epidemic form came to be considered the exception. Pathology findings, both in monkeys and in rare human casualties, led to the conclusion that the disorder was caused by inflammation of the brain and the spinal cord, particularly the afferent nerve roots, perhaps with neuroimmune etiology. In the 1960s and 1970s, chronic fatigue symptoms were often attributed to chronic brucellosis, but typically people were seen as having psychiatric disorders, in particular depression. Epidemic cases of benign myalgic encephalomyelitis were called mass hysteria by psychiatrists McEvedy and Beard in 1970, provoking criticism in letters to the editor of the British Medical Journal by outbreak researchers, attending physicians, and physicians who fell ill. The psychiatrists were faulted for not adequately investigating the patients they described, and their conclusions have been refuted. In 1978 a symposium held at the Royal Society of Medicine (RSM) concluded that \\"epidemic myalgic encephalomyelitis\\" was a distinct disease entity with a clear organic basis. The illness gained national attention in the United States when the popular magazine Hippocrates ran a cover story of an epidemic at Lake Tahoe, Nevada, in the mid-1980s. The designation Chronic Epstein-Barr Virus was in use in the U.S., but the magazine used the term \\"Raggedy Ann Syndrome\\" to note the fatigue and loss of muscle power patients felt. Researchers investigating the Lake Tahoe cluster did not find evidence that EBV was involved, and they proposed the name \\"chronic fatigue syndrome\\", describing the main symptom of the illness. They published the first working case definition for CFS in 1988. Research increased considerably, and more so after the criteria were relaxed in 1994. In 1990, researchers presented evidence they found DNA sequences very similar to the human HTLV-II retrovirus in some CFS patients, at a conference in Kyoto, Japan. Their study was later published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. A reporter on Prime Time Live stated the announcement made headlines all over the world. The CDC first ignored their findings, then later conducted a study and published a paper that refuted the hypothesis. In the United Kingdom, the Chief Medical Officer Kenneth Calman requested a report from the medical Royal Colleges in 1996. This led to the publication of a joint report in which the term \\"chronic fatigue syndrome\\" was found to be most representative. This was followed in 2002 by a further report by the new CMO, Liam Donaldson. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) recognize CFS as a serious illness, and launched a campaign in June 2006 to raise public and medical awareness about it. A 2009 study published in the journal Science reported an association between a retrovirus xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) and CFS. The editors of Science subsequently attached an \\"Editorial Expression of Concern\\" to the report, to the effect that the validity of the study \\"is now seriously in question\\". and in September 2011, the authors published a \\"Partial Retraction\\" of their 2009 findings; this was followed by a full retraction by the magazine’s Editor in Chief, after the authors failed to agree on a full retraction statement. Also in September 2011, the Blood XMRV Scientific Research Working Group published a report, which concluded \\"that currently available XMRV/P-MLV assays, including the assays employed by the three participating laboratories that previously reported positive results on samples from CFS patients and controls (2, 4), cannot reproducibly detect direct virus markers (RNA, DNA, or culture) or specific antibodies in blood samples from subjects previously characterized as XMRV/P-MLV positive (all but one with a diagnosis of CFS) or healthy blood donors.\\" In December 2011, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences published a similar retraction for an August 2010 paper. Some members of the patient community, who had viewed the XMRV findings as a source of hope for a possible cure, initially reacted negatively when the papers were called into question. One UK researcher reported verbal abuse after publishing an early paper indicating that the XMRV studies were flawed. International classifications The World Health Organization's (WHO) International Classification of Diseases (ICD), mandates the international classifications of diseases to allow comparison of health and health fields across countries and throughout the world. Not all terms appear in the tabular list (Volume 1), and many more terms are listed in the alphabetic index (Volume 3) of the ICD. =ICD-8= Since its introduction into the eighth edition of the WHO ICD-8 in 1969 (code 323), (Benign) myalgic encephalomyelitis has been classified as a disease of the central nervous system. =ICD-9= The term \\"benign myalgic encephalomyelitis\\" appears in the 1975 ICD-9 alphabetic index, and references code 323.9, Encephalitis of unspecified cause. The code 323.9 did not include reference to postviral syndrome. The term “postviral syndrome” was classified to code 780.7, Malaise and fatigue, in Chapter 16, Symptoms, signs and ill- defined conditions. The name Chronic Fatigue Syndrome has been attributed to the USA Centers for Disease Control 1988 research case definition for the illness, \\"Chronic fatigue syndrome: a working case definition\\". Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) was added to ICD-9 after 1988 and listed under code 780.71, Symptoms Signs and Ill-defined Conditions. ICD-9-CM Since 1979 the U.S. has used a clinical modification of WHO's ICD 9th revision (ICD-9-CM), and ME is under index: \\"Encephalomyelitis (chronic) (granulomatous) (hemorrhagic necrotizing, acute) (myalgic, benign) (see also Encephalitis) 323.9.\\" Index to Diseases ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Publications/ICD9-CM/2006/Dindex07.zip For CFS, a modification to the alphabetic index was made, effective on October 1, 1991, to direct users to code 780.7, Malaise and fatigue, the same code used to identify cases of postviral syndrome. In 1998, a new five-digit code included 780.71, Chronic fatigue syndrome, consistent with the WHO version of ICD-9. Chronic fatigue syndrome is classified in tabular list: \\"Symptoms, Signs and Ill-Defined Conditions,\\" under the sub-heading of \\"General Symptoms\\". Tabular List ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Publications/ICD9-CM/2006/Dtab07.zip =ICD-10= CFS is not included as a coded term in the 1992 ICD-10, WHO created a new category G93, Other disorders of brain, in Chapter VI, Diseases of the Nervous System, and created a new code G93.3, post-viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS), a condition which was previously in the symptom chapter of ICD-9. WHO also moved benign myalgic encephalomyelitis to G93.3, subordinate to PVFS. The alphabetic index contains other terms, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, to which WHO assigned the same code. ICD-10-CM The proposed U.S. classification ICD-10-CM (2010 Update replaces July 2009 version) separates CFS and Postviral fatigue syndrome into mutually exclusive categories. \\"Chronic fatigue, unspecified  Chronic fatigue syndrome not otherwise specified\\" appears in Chapter XVIII under R53.82. \\"Postviral fatigue syndrome  benign myalgic encephalomyelitis\\" appears in Chapter VI under G93.3.https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10cm.htm International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), 2010 Update. Retrieved 2010-05-21. The Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Advisory Committee (CFSAC) had previously recommended CFS to be placed under the same neurological code as ME and PVFS, G93.3.

Armenia, Mesopotamia, Babylonia and Assyria with Adjacent Regions\\", Karl von Spruner, published in 1865.Then this area became alternately part of the Medes and Persia. In the 2nd century B.C. the region became part of the Armenian kingdom, where the Armenian principality Parspatunik was established, which existed until the 6th century A.D. Small Armenian melikdoms of Karadagh (Arasbaran) remained until the Turkish invasion of 1918. The Armenian population is preserved in the mountains of Arasbaran(Karadagh) in modern day. There is no mention of Arasbaran as a geo-political entity in written sources dating prior to Safavid era. There is a speculation that the region referred to as Syah Kuh by the 10th-century Muslim geographer, Ibn Hawqal,Abu-'l-Qāsim Ibn-ʻAlī Ibn-Ḥauqal, The Oriental Geography of Ebn Haukal, an Arabian Traveller of the Tenth Century, London, 1800 pp.184-185. corresponds to the present day Arasbaran. However, the said Syahkoh has more similarities with Manghishlaq in the eastern shores of Caspian Sea.Kevin Alan Brook, The Jews of Khazaria, 2006, Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, pp. 152-153 Therefore, Arasbaran's history should be considered in the context of its two main towns, Ahar and Kaleybar. Kaleybar, formerly known as bedh, was the stronghold of Babak Khorramdin who, in 816 AD, revolted against Islamic Caliphate and was defeated in 836 AD.K. Farrokh, Iran at War: 1500-1988, 2011, Osprey Publishing The events of the two decades long tumultuous times have been extensively reported by Islamic historians of the epoch. The first report is by Al-Masudi in The Meadows of Gold: Babak revolted in Bedh region with the disciples of Djavidan ...‘Alī ibn al-Husayn al- Mas‘Ūdī, Pavet de Courteille, Les Prairies d'or de Maçoudi, 1873, Paris, vol. 7, p. 62 Following a series of defeats Babak was blockaded in his native town..., which even now is known as Babak's country.‘Alī ibn al- Husayn al- Mas‘Ūdī, Pavet de Courteille, Les Prairies d'or de Maçoudi, 1873, Paris, vol. 7, p. 123 Ibn Athir in his book, The Complete History, has devoted many pages to the description of battles.عز الدین ابن اثیر، تاریخ کامل، ۱۳۸۱، تهران، جلد نهم، صص‌. ۳۹۸۲-۴۰۱۲. Yaqut al-Hamawi, writing in early thirteenth century, describes Kaleybar in the following words, County between Azerbaijan and Erran.... This county produces pomegranates of incomparable beauty, excellent figs and grapes that are dried on fires (because the sun is always obscured by thick clouds).Yaqut ibn 'Abd Allah al-Rumi al-Hamawi, Charles Adrien Casimir Barbier de Meynard, Dictionnaire géographique, historique et littéraire de la Perse et des contrees adjacentes, 1851, Paris, pp. 87-88 In the 12th-13th centuries, Ahar was a minor and short-lived, but prosperous emirate ruled by the Pishteginid dynasty of Georgian origin (1155—1231).Minorsky, Vladimir (1951), \\"The Georgian Maliks of Ahar.\\" BSOAS vol. 13/4, pp. 868-77. Yaqut al-Hamawi, describes Ahar as very flourishing despite its small extent.Yaqut ibn 'Abd Allah al-Rumi al-Hamawi, Charles Adrien Casimir Barbier de Meynard, Dictionnaire géographique, historique et littéraire de la Perse et des contrees adjacentes, 1851, Paris, p. 57 Both towns lost most of their importance during the rule of Ilkhanate. Hamdallah Mustawfi, writing in the-mid fourteenth century, describes Ahar as \\"a little town\\",نزهةالقلوب ، حمداله مستوفی ، به کوشش محمد دبیر سیاقی ، انتشارات کتابخانه طهوری ، چاپ اول ، تهران ، ۱۳۳۶، ص. ۹۵. and Kaleybar as \\"A village of Azerbaijan, in the woods near a mountain which comprises a fortress\\".Yaqut ibn 'Abd Allah al-Rumi al-Hamawi, Charles Adrien Casimir Barbier de Meynard, Dictionnaire géographique, historique et littéraire de la Perse et des contrees adjacentes, 1851, Paris, p. 493نزهةالقلوب ، حمداله مستوفی ، به کوشش محمد دبیر سیاقی ، انتشارات کتابخانه طهوری ، چاپ اول ، تهران ، ۱۳۳۶، ص. ۹۶. Ahar was in the focus of Safavid dynasty's agenda for casting of Azerbaijan as a Safavid dominion. Thus, Shah Abbas rebuilt the mausoleum of Sheikh Sheikh Shihab-al-din in Ahar.Kishwar Rizvi , The Safavid Dynastic Shrine: Architecture, Religion and Power in Early ..., 2011, I.B.Tauris, p. 161 In 1604, as Ottoman forces threatened the area directly to the north of Arasbaran during the Ottoman-Safavid War (1603-1618), Shah Abbas ordered Maqsud Sultan to evacuate the entire population of the Nakhichevan region (including the Armenians of Jolfa, who, in the following year, were transplanted to Isfahan) to Arasbaran and Dezmar. Arasbaran region suffered enormously during Russo- Persian War (1804–13) and Russo-Persian War (1826–28) due to its proximity to the war zone. Western travellers in 1837-1843 period had found Ahar, a city with around 700 households, in wretched condition.Richard Tappe, Frontier Nomads of Iran: A Political and Social History of the Shahsevan, 1997, Cambridge University Press, p. 171 Arasbaran was one of the epicentres of Persian Constitutional Revolution. Arasbaran tribes were heavily involved in armed conflicts; the revolutionary and anti-revolutionary camps were headed, respectively, by Sattar Khan and Rahimkhan Chalabianloo, both from Qaradağ region. When in 1925 Rezā Shāh deposed Ahmad Shah Qajar and founded the Pahlavi dynasty, Arasbaran's gradual decline started. The new king insisting on cultural and ethnic nationalism, and implemented a policy of cultural assimilation. He renamed Qaradağ as Arasbaran to deny the Turkic identity of the inhabitants. Consequently, Arasbaran is no longer in the focus of national politics. Still, many books and articles are being written on the contribution of Arasbaran region, and its inhabitants in the contemporary history of Iran cannot be underestimated.

Arasbaran ecotourism potential The declaration by UNESCO of Arasbaran as a UNESCO Biosphere reserve in 1976 was a great endorsement for the region's ecotourism potential. More recently, visitors from places as far away as Canada have expressed their amazement with approving words.Jamie Maslin, \\"Iranian Rappers and Persian Porn: A Hitchhiker's Adventures in the New Iran\\", 2009 The planned promotion of the Biosphere to the National Park status may farther enhance Arasbaran's environmental significance. Arasbaran is home to 215 species of birds, notably the Caucasian black grouse, grey partridge, black francolin, and common pheasant, 29 species of reptiles, 48 species of mammals, notably wild goat, wild boar, brown bear, wolf, lynx, and leopard, and 17 species of fish. There is an effort going on to revitalise(??) the extinct sub-species of Caspian red deer local to the area (If extinct then how can it be \\"revitalised\\"?). The local flora include hornbeam, sumac, and Berberis.Asef, M.R. (2007) Macrofungi flora of Arasbaran 1. Cortinarius subgenus Myxacium. Rostaniha 8(2) 178–185Asef, M.R. (2012), Lepiotaceous fungi (Agaricaceae) in the Iranian part of Caucasia, Turkish Journal of Botany. 36: 289–294. doi:10.3906/bot-1006-10 A unique characteristic of Arasbaran forests is the ubiquity of edible wild trees. For instance, a patch of forest between Aghaweye and Oskolou includes hazelnut trees. The large walnut and Cornus mas trees, which grow wild alongside streams, provide an important income source for inhabitants. More exotic plant species, such as redcurrant, truffle and herbs with application in traditional medicine significantly add to the ecological importance of Arasbaran region. A recent study has indicated that three sites have the highest potential for ecotourism. These sites, which are located alongside the road connecting Kaleybar to Asheqlu (Abbasabad-Aynaloo- Vayqan direction), include Mikandi valley, Aynali forests and Babak Castle.Neda Mohseni, Shahram Roostaei, Arasbaran ecotourism potential assessment with emphasis on the scientific and additional values, International Research Journal of Applied and Basic Sciences. (2012) 3:1143–1147 There are, however, more unexplored tourist potentials. One example is a holy mountain located at the coordinate (38°55'16.64\\"N,46°47'24.62\\"E). Most inhabitants of the now abandoned village, Garmanab, were Izadis, the followers Yârsân religion. They used to slaughter sacrificial animals in the site, which is located at the slopes of a hill. Nobody bothered to ask the reasons behind the holiness of the site. However, the pleasures of an occasional feast was so tempting that the followers of the Shia' sect attended the holy site, too. Nowadays there are few worshipers and the centuries long traditions are almost forgotten. The revival of these rituals may attract cultural visitors. Another potential tourist attraction are the summer camps (ییلاق) of semi-settled Tribes of Arasbaran, known as Ilat, who spend five months of the year in uplands for grazing their livestock. A tourist, while enjoying the fresh thin air of the mountains, may get a chance to observe the age-long traditional living styles of the locals. Some of the attractive sites are Aliabad mountains, meadows above Shojaabad, East Azerbaijan village, and Chaparli and Aqdash summer quarters, all located in a driving distance from Kaleybar. Numerous hot springs, scattered all over the region, have been considered as attractions for promoting tourism. One example is Motaalleq hot spring therapeutic facility, which is the largest of its kind in Iran. The facility, with an area of 12870 m2 includes bathing areas, coffee-shop, restaurants, prayer room, and gymnasium. In recent years, the local government has organised Zoğal festivals in Kaleybar as a means of promoting tourism. In addition, every year, in the second half of October, a Pomegranate Festival is organised in by the provincial authorities in Mardanaqom village. The main programme of the festival is the performance of ashugh music. Nearly every village in the region has a landmark in its territories. Some of these are potential tourism attractions. For instance, there is a landmark ancient plane tree in the Kavanaq village, whose photo is presented here. The tree is about 3 metres in diameter and is said to have lived for 500 years. The villagers have developed interesting oral narratives around the events experienced by the tree. Demography '''''' In the wake of Russo-Persian War (1804–13) a significant fraction of the inhabitants lived as nomadic tribes. The major tribes included; Chalabianlu 1500 tents and houses, Karacurlu 2500, Haji-Alilu 800, Begdillu 200, and various minor groups 500.R. Khanam, Encycl. Ethnography Of Middle-East And Central Asia, 2005, p. 313 At the time Ahar, with 3500 inhabitants, was the only city of Qaradağ.Bibliothèque orientale Elzévirienne, Volume 52; Volume 55, 1887 p.224. By the beginning of the twentieth century the settlement of tribesman were growing and in 1920 there were more than four hundred villages, less than thirty of which were Armenian.Report on India and Persia of the deputation: sent by the Board of foreign missions of the Presbyterian church in the U.S.A. to visit these fields in 1921–22, p. 513 However, the nomadic way of living has survived to the present. The nomadic population at present has been estimated to be about 36000, and is not significantly different from the 30000 estimate of 1960. The defeat of Soviet-created \\"Azerbaijan People's Government\\" following WWII and the ensuing events, resulted in mass migration of inhabitants to Tabriz and Tehran. Most of these migrants settled in the shanty towns and worked as painters. The land reforms of 1962–1964William Bayne Fisher (editor), The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 1, 1968 p.684 accelerated the migration. The case of a typical village, Abbasabad, is a good example to demonstrate the population depletion; the number of families dropped from 60 families at 1970 to 12 at 2006. After the election of Ahmadinezhad as president of Iran, a rumour was circulated that UNESCO will compensate the residents to have the village evacuated for wild-life protection efforts. Some early emigrants returned and built decent houses. At the present the region is undergoing a population boom as more wealthy city residents want to spend their retirement in a cleaner environment. Recently, the deputy governor of the East Azarbaijan province has mentioned the phenomenon of reverse migration to Khoda Afarin and Kaleybar counties. The problem is that the population is aging and the working class adults, in the face of scarce job opportunities, live most of the year in large population centres such as Tehran. The issue is so critical that during recent presidential campaign, Mohsen Rezaee referred to Iranian villages as the old age residence.http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=13920314000317 =Languages= The spoken language of majority of the inhabitant is Azeri, which has a reasonable degree of intelligibility with Turkmeni, Afshar and the Anatolian Turkish.Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World, 2010, Elsevier, p. 110-113 Most inhabitants are bilingual in Persian language, which is the official language of Iran and the sole language of education. The ancient language of Azerbaijan, namely Tati survives in the Karingani dialect of the language. In addition to the large village of Karingan, the neighboring villages of Chay Kandi, Kalasor, Khoynarood, and Arazin are likewise the remaining Tati-speaking Old Azari/Tati-speaking native,James Stuart Olson, Lee Brigance Pappas, Nicholas Charles Pappas (Editors), An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires 1994, p. 623E. Yarshater, Iranian Languages and Texts from Iran and Turan, edited by Maria Macuch, Mauro Maggi, Werner Sundermann, 2007, page 443. a language which was the Iranian language of Azerbaijan before the arrival of Turkic speakers in large numbers during the long wars between Safavid Persia/Iran and the Ottoman Empire in the 16the and 17th centuries, where a large population transfer took place between the two. This language, has a rare and unusual point of grammar called the hearsay tense.Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul: Memories and the City, Random house (2004) Consequently, in Azerbaijani speaking society the boundary between the private and shared memories becomes fuzzy, and the magnitude of time lapse between the events shrinks. This is an ideal feature for the generation of oral cultural artifacts, particularly mythology, epics and folkloric music. A rare opportunity for recording and preserving Qaradağ's culture was provided by the innovative method by which Shahriar in his famous verse book, Heydar Babaya Salam adopted to summarize the Cultural identity in concise poetic form. A generation of lesser known poets from Arasbaran used similar approach for perpetuating region's oral traditions. Remarkable examples are mourning Sabalan by Abbas Barez, and \\"Hail to Qizil Qala'h\\" by Seifollah Delkhon. Another example is Mohamad Golmohamadi's long poem, titled I am madly in love with Qareh Dagh (قاراداغ اؤلکه‌سینین گؤر نئجه دیوانه‌سی ام), which is a concise description of the region's cultural landscape. =Mythology= The inhabitants of every village attribute spiritual importance to at multiple sites, scattered throughout the village territory. These places, generally known as Ojaq, are located in areas with rapid variation on the land topography, and are in some way linked to Djins via established narratives. Most of these sites possess any significantly conspicuous landmark. At some sites, which are considered sacred by many villages, people will occasionally gather to slaughter sacrificial animals or offer a simple meal of freshly baked bread and cheese with tea. At some sites, they have collected medium- sized rocks around some trees and hang coloured threads or ribbons from the trees. In most villages, there are sites with narrative associations, which are not considered sacred. These sites are in secluded locations formed by natural topography of the landscape. Often the narratives involve bears as the principal subject. The main theme of the narratives is the following. A male bear kidnaps a blackberry picking pretty girl and takes her to his den. A hybrid child is born, but the girl runs away at the first opportunity leaving the lamenting bear entreatingly crying for his lost wife. According to a myth the wolf is found as a symbol of merciless power that is able to destroy everything. If a human being touches it, whatever frightens him/her will be frustrated.Rafifar, Jalal. \\"Some indications of shamanism in Arasbaran rock carvings.\\" Documenta Praehistorica 34 (2007): 203-13. Vergi Vergi, meaning gift, is a perceived ability for performing extraordinary feats such as prophesy or healing, which supposedly can only be received from god or from Shia' Imams. It is believed that a Vergi is inherited and not to be learned. For instance, there is a family in Vayqan among whom the Vergi for catching snakes is transmitted from generation to generation. Sometimes, the Vergi is claimed to be received in dreams. But often, it is received in Ojaqs where ghosts show themselves to and talk to gifted. It is believed that there is no escape from Vergi and that, at first, it generates suffering comparable to shamanistic illness. Toğs; relics of Ashura day? Ashura, the 10th day of the lunar month Muharram, is the day at which the mourning celebrations commemorating Imam Husayns' martyrdom reach their climax.Reinhol Loefler, Islam in Practice: Religious Beliefs in a Persian Village, State University of New York Press, 1988, p. 290 In many villages of Qaradağ, palm sized metallic icons fixed on a medium-sized wooden handles, locally known as Toğs, are harbingers of the exact hour when Husayn was killed; allegedly, they relapse to utter in-animation following ten days of relentless erratic movements at the hands of their carriers (alamdars). The tuğs – believed to be sisters – are housed in the mosques and are greatly revered by the inhabitants of all neighbouring villages. Unfortunately, there are no systematic studies or first hand reports on these fascinating relics. Still, every year, as a ritualistic obligation, expatriates flock to the said villages to receive the blessings of the sacred day in the company of their sacred Toğs. In the accompanying photo two persons holding toğ can be seen, who are surrounded by mourners beating on their legs. One toğ is kept standing still in the centre. It seems that the other toğ is performing erratic motions and is pulling the holder. =Arasbaran dogs= Orhan Pamuk in 2001 Turkish novel, My Name Is Red,Orhan Pamuk,My Name Is Red, 2006, Random House LLC., Chap. 3 gives a vivid description of Turkic people's love-hate attitude towards dogs. Every summer, the real life version of this description is in display in Chaparli. Each family has 2-5 dogs, all with characteristic cropped ears and tails. The dogs are fed generous portions of milk soaked bread. When the sheep herds are brought back for milking near tents, dogs sleep around the camp most of the day. The inhabitants treat the beasts with utter respect, a manner which is loathed by more pious villagers of the region as a pagan act. Between dusk and down dogs regain their vicious character; strangers have to avoid crossing a campsite otherwise the attacking dogs cannot be controlled even by their owners. Fending off the dogs by beating is considered an act of aggression towards the owner and should be avoided. In fact most of the feuds between settled villagers and pastoralists are about dogs. =Arasbaran carpet= Carpet weaving stands out as the acme of Azeri art and people of Arasbaran have significantly contributed to this artistic tradition. Arabaran carpet was a hybrid between Persian carpet and Azerbaijani rug. There were indigenous styles as well. For instance, carpets known as Balan rugs had a size of approximately 1x4 m2 and a characteristic pattern. The acme of carpet weaving art in Arasbaran is manifested in verni,K K Goswam, Advances in Carpet Manufacture, 2008, Woodhead Publishing in Textiles, p. 148 which was originated in Nagorno-Karabakh. Verni is a carpet-like kilim with a delicate and fine warp and weft, which is woven without a previous sketch, thanks to the creative talents of nomadic women and girls. Verni weavers employ the image of birds and animals (deer, rooster, cat, snake, birds, gazelle, sheep, camel, wolf and eagle) in simple geometrical shapes, imitating the earthenware patterns that were popular in prehistoric times. A key décor feature, which is intrinsic to many vernis, is the S-element. Its shape varies; it may resemble both the figure 5 and letter S. This element means “dragon” among the nomads. At present, verni is woven by the girls of Arasbaran Tribes, often in the same room where the nomadic tribes reside, and is a significant income source for about 20000 families. =Ashughi music and Qaradağ's contribution= Bəlkə bu yerlərə birdə gəlmədim (I may not come to these mountains again) duman səlamət qal dağ səlamət qal (Farewell to the Mist and to the mountain) arxamca su səpir göydə bulutlar (Clouds sprinkle drops of rain) leysan səlamət qal yağ səlamət qal (Farewell to summer days, farewell to the rain) These opening verses of a contemporary ashug song, composed by Məhəmməd Araz,محمد آراز، بلكه بويئرلره بيرده گلمه‌ديم ، ۱۳۸۹، تبریز، نشر اختر may well represent the essence of Qaradağ's cultural identity; frequent allusions to a mountain with the intention of arousing an emotional state with a tone of mild melancholy- a state well expressed by the ashughi music. A century long autocratic nation building policies of Pahlavi era in Iran has succeeded in cultural assimilation in the favor of a government sanctioned culture. The mountainous region of Qaradağ, however, relatively escaped the demise due to its remoteness and inaccessibility. Many elements of the indigenous culture, particularly local music, have survived to the present day. More recently a slow but persistent cultural revival has been in progress and the inhabitants along with their city dwelling relatives perceive an awareness of their common cultural roots with the inhabitants of eastern Turkey and Azerbaijan republics, where a cultural renaissance is well underway since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The ashughi music is cornerstone of this shared identity. The number of ashughs has significantly increased after Aşiq Imran Heydəri (عاشیق ایمران حیدری) started accepting pupils to his academic style classes in Tabriz. Imran's efforts effectively shifted the general impression of the ashugh music from association to the nomadic life in mountains to a music suited for performances in urban settings. At present, the de facto representative of ashughs is Aşiq Rəsol Qorbani from Abbasabad village. Economy Up until the Islamic revolution the region had a subsistence economy – all food was produced within the villages and the surplus was bartered with items supplied by travelling salesman. Most women spent winter months weaving carpets using raw material which were locally produced. Rainfed agriculture on the steep slopes had severely eroded the farms and productivity had dropped to an unsustainable low level, and the inhabitants had to supplement their income by taking seasonal construction jobs in Tehran. After the revolution, thanks to the construction of roads giving accessibility to larger town markets, livestock production became the dominant mode of the region's economy. However, the quarrels over grazing rights didn't allow large-scale animal agriculture. In recent years beekeeping has emerged as the only occupation that can provide a family with sufficient income. The honey produced in villages close to pastures is renowned for its quality and has an established niche market. Mardanaqom village is one of the main producers of honey.

A jackshaft, also called a countershaft, is a common mechanical design component used to transfer or synchronize rotational force in a machine. A jackshaft is often just a short stub with supporting bearings on the ends and two pulleys, gears, or cranks attached to it. In general, a jackshaft is any shaft that is used as an intermediary transmitting power from a driving shaft to a driven shaft. History =Jackshaft= The oldest uses of the term jackshaft appear to involve shafts that were intermediate between water wheels or stationary steam engines and the line shafts of 19th century mills.James Emerson, Report of Water-Wheel Tests at Lowell and Other Places, Journal of the Franklin Institute, Vol. LXIII, No. 3 (March, 1872); pages 177-178.Holyoke Warter Power Co., Experiments with Gears, Belts and Draft Tubes, Holyoke Hydrodynamic Experiments, Weaver Shipman and Co., Springfield, Mass., 1880; pages 73-76. In these early sources from New England mills in 1872 and 1880, the term \\"jack shaft\\" always appears in quotes. Another 1872 author wrote \\"Gear wheels are used in England to transmit the power of the engine to what is usually called the jack shaft.\\"Coleman Sellers, Transmission of Motion, Journal of the Franklin Institute, Vol. LXIV, No. 5 (Nov. 1872); pages 305-319, countershaft is defined on page 314, jack shaft on page 316. By 1892, the quotes were gone, but the use remained the same.Robert Grimshaw, Drive for Power Transmission, Cassier's Magazine Vol. II, No. 9 (July 1892); pages 219-224, see particularly figure 1 and the discussion of it on pages 223-224. The pulleys on the jackshafts of mills or power plants were frequently connected to the shaft with clutches. For example, in the 1890s, the generating room of the Virginia Hotel in Chicago had two Corliss engines and five dynamos, linked through a jackshaft. Clutches on the jackshaft pulleys allowed any or all of the dynamos to be driven by either or both of the engines.John J. Flather, Rope-Driving: A treatise on the transmission of power by means of fibrous ropes, Wiley, New York, 1895; pages 42-43. Fig. 21 shows part of the jack-shaft. With the advent of chain-drive vehicles, the term jackshaft was generally applied to the final intermediate shaft in the drive train, either a chain driven shaft driving pinions that directly engaged teeth on the inside of the rims of the drive wheels,The Darling Steam Carriage, The Horseless Age, Vol. 5, No. 2 (Oct. 11, 1899); page 6.Some New American Steam Carriages, The Motor Car Journal, Vol I, No. 36 (Nov. 10, 1899); page 565. or the output shaft of the transmission/differential that is linked by chain to the drive wheels.The Grout Steam Tonneau, Cycle and Automobile Trade Journal Vol II, No. 8 (Feb 1, 1902) ;pages 55-56. One of the first uses of the term jackshaft in the context of railroad equipment was in an 1890 patent application by Samuel Mower. In his electric-motor driven railroad truck, the motor was geared to a jackshaft mounted between the side frames. A sliding Dog clutch inside the jackshaft was used to select one of several gear ratios on the chain drive to the driven axle.Samuel E. Mower, Electric-Motor Mechanism, , issued Apr. 21, 1891. Later railroad jackshafts were generally connected to the driving wheels using side rods; see Jackshaft (locomotive) for details. =Countershaft= The term countershaft is somewhat older. In 1828, the term was used to refer to an intermediate horizontal shaft in a gristmill driven through gearing by the waterwheel and driving the millstones through bevel gears.James Hindman and William Hindman, Improvement in the Grist Mill, The American Journal of Improvements in the Useful Arts and Mirror of the Patent Office in the United States, Vol I, No. 3 (July, Aug. and Sept. 1828); page 324. This reads like a patent application, there is no record of a corresponding patent. An 1841 textbook used the term to refer to a short shaft driven by a belt from the line shaft and driving the spindle of a lathe through additional belts. The countershaft and the lathe spindle each carried cones of different-diameter pulleys for speed control.Robert Willis, Part the Third, Chapter II  To Alter the Velocity Ratio by Determinate Changes, Principles of Mechanism Designed for the Use of Students in the Universities and for Engineering Students Generally, John W. Parker, London, 1841; page 433. In 1872, this definition was given: \\"The term countershaft is applied to all shafts driven from the main line [shaft] when placed at or near the machines to be driven ...\\" ;Modern uses Modern jackshafts and countershafts are often hidden inside large machinery as components of the larger overall device. A PTO Shaft or jackshaft with a protective shield to prevent entanglement. In farm equipment, a spinning output shaft on the rear of the vehicle is commonly referred to as the Power Take-Off or PTO, and the power- transfer shaft that is connected to it is commonly called a PTO shaft, but is also a jackshaft.

It served a largely advisory role, with most powers over the Territory still lying in the hands of the relevant federal minister through the life of the Assembly. Background Three years after the seat of government was established at Canberra and after the opening of the first Parliament House in 1927, an appointed Advisory Council was established to administer the capital. In 1974 this was replaced by a fully elected Legislative Assembly, advising the Department of the Capital Territory. In 1979 this became a House of Assembly of 18 elected members, which was dissolved in 1986. In 1978 a referendum on self-government was defeated, with 68 per cent of voters recording a No vote. The federal Labor government of Prime Minister Bob Hawke set up a Self-Government Task Force in 1986 to report on the government of the ACT. Creation of the Assembly The assembly was first created in 1975 by the Whitlam government, as a response to frequent criticism about the lack of representation for the citizens of the territory. Whitlam had appointed the local federal MP, Kep Enderby, as Minister for the ACT, and Enderby sought to create a new representative body along the lines of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, which had been created in 1974. Elections were held for the first Legislative Assembly on 28 September that year, with representatives of the Labor Party, Liberal Party, Australia Party, and several independents taking seats in the Assembly. Unlike its Northern Territory counterpart, it was not made self-governing in 1977. Nine members were elected by Single Transferable Vote proportional representation from each of the ACT's two federal House of Representatives divisions, making 18 in total. Independent members who vacated mid-term were replaced by recounting their original votes to their next preferences to choose a runner-up. Members endorsed by a political party were replaced by a nominee of that party. The new Assembly began sitting in the then-Civic Offices, later renovated to become the current Legislative Assembly Building. An independent MLA, Jim Pead, took office as the first President (the equivalent of the Speaker) of the new body. Gordon Walsh became the first leader of the Labor caucus, with Dr Peter Hughes leading the Liberal caucus. Both were replaced in 1977; Walsh joined the nascent Australian Democrats, and was replaced as leader by Peter Vallee, Hughes quit the Liberal Party and was replaced as leader by Jim Leedman. Ivor Vivian became the leader of the Australia Party, before being replaced by Walsh in 1977. The first Assembly saw two prominent members on its benches: future federal ministers Ros Kelly and Susan Ryan. Ryan resigned during the first term, successfully seeking a seat in the Senate. The second election for the Assembly was held on 2 June 1979, and saw a change in name from the Legislative Assembly to the House of Assembly. The election saw the addition of a fourth party, with the conservative Family Team led by Bev Cains winning a seat. It also saw the election of future self-government ministers Greg Cornwell and Paul Whalan. A third election was held on 5 June 1982, which saw the introduction of a more partisan system. The Liberals held a majority in the Assembly, with Leedman becoming Leader of the House, and new Labor leader Ken Doyle becoming the minority leader. He was to be short-lived as leader, with Maurene Horder succeeding him after only two years. The last Assembly also saw the creation of an office of Speaker, filled by independent MHA Harold Hird. The final election also saw the election of future Liberal Chief Minister Trevor Kaine. It was allowed to expire in 1986 due to plans to introduce full self-government for the territory. After some years of discussions, the House of Assembly was replaced with the current Legislative Assembly in 1989, with new Labor leader Rosemary Follett becoming the first Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory. Voting was not compulsory for the House of Assembly, and its influence was limited. Many of its prominent figures retired rather than contest the elections for the new Legislative Assembly in 1989; several others, including outgoing Speaker Harold Hird and Family Team leader Bev Cains were soundly defeated. Three MHAs, however—Greg Cornwell, Trevor Kaine, and Paul Whalan—went on to be elected to the new parliament, and later served in major roles.

Favreau attended the College of the Holy Cross, graduating as valedictorian. In college, he accumulated scholastic honors, and took part in and directed community and civic programs. After graduation, he went to work for the John Kerry presidential campaign in 2004, working to collect talk radio news for the campaign and was promoted to the role of Deputy Speechwriter. Favreau first met Barack Obama, then a state Senator from Illinois, while working on the Kerry campaign. In 2005, Obama's communications director Robert Gibbs recommended Favreau to Obama as a speechwriter. Favreau was hired as Obama's speechwriter shortly after Obama's election to the United States Senate. Obama and Favreau grew close, and Obama referred to him as his \\"mind reader.\\" He went on the campaign trail with Obama during his successful presidential election campaign. In 2009, he was named to the White House staff as Director of Speechwriting. In January 2017, he co-founded liberal media company Crooked Media with fellow former Obama staffers Tommy Vietor and Jon Lovett, and began co-hosting the political podcast Pod Save America with Vietor, Lovett and Dan Pfeiffer. Early life Favreau was born at Winchester Hospital and raised in nearby North Reading, Massachusetts, the son of Lillian (née DeMarkis), a schoolteacher, and Mark Favreau. His father is of French Canadian descent and his mother is of Greek descent. His grandfather Robert Favreau was a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives and described by Favreau as a \\"New England Republican.\\" Favreau graduated from the Jesuit College of the Holy Cross in 2003 as his class's valedictorian, with a degree in political science. At Holy Cross, he was treasurer and debate committee chairman for the College Democrats, and studied classical piano. From 1999 to 2000, he served on the Welfare Solidarity Project, eventually becoming its director. In 2001, Favreau worked with Habitat for Humanity and a University of Massachusetts Amherst program to bring visitors to cancer patients. In 2002, he became head of an initiative to help unemployed individuals improve their résumés and interview skills. He also earned a variety of honors in college, including the Vanicelli Award; being named the 2001 Charles A. Dana Scholar; memberships in the Political Science Honor Society, Pi Sigma Alpha, the College Honors Program, the Sociology Honor Society, Alpha Kappa Delta, and was awarded a Harry S. Truman Scholarship in 2002. He was an editor on his college newspaper, and during summers in college, he earned extra income selling newspapers as a telemarketer, while also interning in John Kerry's offices. Kerry campaign He joined Senator John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign soon after graduation from the College of the Holy Cross. While working for the Kerry campaign, his job was to assemble audio clips of talk radio programs for the Kerry camp to review for the next day. When the Kerry campaign began to falter at one point, they found themselves without a speechwriter, and Favreau was promoted to the role of deputy speechwriter. Following Kerry's defeat, Favreau became dispirited with politics, and was uncertain if he would do such work again. Favreau first met Obama (then an Illinois State Senator running for the U.S. Senate), while still working for Kerry, backstage at the 2004 Democratic National Convention as Obama was rehearsing his keynote address. Favreau, then 23 years old, interrupted Obama's rehearsal, advising the soon-to-be-elected Senator that a rewrite was needed to avoid an overlap with Kerry's address. Obama campaign Obama communications aide Robert Gibbs, who had worked for Kerry's campaign, recommended Favreau to Obama as an excellent writer, and in 2005 he began working for Barack Obama in his United States Senate office, before joining Obama's presidential campaign as chief speechwriter in 2006. His interview with Obama was on the Senator's first day. Uninterested in Favreau's résumé, Obama instead questioned Favreau on what motivated him to work in politics, and what his theory of writing was. He described this theory to Obama as, \\"A speech can broaden the circle of people who care about this stuff. How do you say to the average person that's been hurting: 'I hear you, I'm there?' Even though you've been so disappointed and cynical about politics in the past, and with good reason, we can move in the right direction. Just give me a chance.\\" Favreau led a speech writing team for the campaign which included Ben Rhodes and Cody Keenan. For his work with Obama in the campaign, he would wake as early as 5 a.m., and routinely stayed up until 3 a.m. working on speeches. His leadership style among the other Obama speechwriters was very informal. They would often meet in a small conference room, discussing their work late into the evening over take-out food. According to Rhodes, Favreau did not drive structured meetings with agendas. \\"If he had, we probably would have laughed at him,\\" Rhodes said. Favreau was planning to hire more speechwriters to assist him, but conceded he was unsure of how to manage them. According to him, \\"My biggest strength isn't the organization thing.\\" He has likened his position to \\"Ted Williams' batting coach\\", because of Obama's celebrated abilities as a speaker and writer. Obama senior adviser David Axelrod said of Favreau, \\"Barack trusts him...And Barack doesn't trust too many folks with that—the notion of surrendering that much authority over his own words.\\" In Obama's own words, Favreau is his \\"mind reader.\\" He and Obama share a fierce sports rivalry, between the Boston Red Sox, favored by Favreau, and the Chicago White Sox, favored by Obama. When the White Sox defeated the Red Sox 3–0 in the 2005 American League playoffs, Obama swept off Favreau's desk with a small broom. During the campaigns, he was obsessed with election tracking polls, jokingly referring to them as his \\"daily crack.\\" At points during the campaign, he was said to feel overwhelmed by his responsibilities, and would turn to Axelrod, and his friends for advice. Favreau has declared that the speeches of Robert F. Kennedy and Michael Gerson have influenced his work, and has expressed admiration for Peggy Noonan's speechwriting, citing a talk given by Ronald Reagan at Pointe du Hoc as his favorite Noonan speech. Gerson also admires Favreau's work, and sought him out at an Obama New Hampshire campaign rally to speak with the younger speechwriter. He was the primary writer of Obama's inauguration address of January 2009. The Guardian describes the process as follows: \\"The inaugural speech has shuttled between them [Obama and Favreau] four or five times, following an initial hour-long meeting in which the President-elect spoke about his vision for the address, and Favreau took notes on his computer. Favreau then went away and spent weeks on research. His team interviewed historians and speechwriters, studied periods of crisis, and listened to past inaugural orations. When ready, he took up residence in a Starbucks in Washington and wrote the first draft.\\" White House Director of Speechwriting When President Obama assumed office in 2009, Favreau was appointed Assistant to the President and Director of Speechwriting. He became the second-youngest chief White House speechwriter on record, after James Fallows. His salary was $172,200 a year. Favreau has said his work with Obama will be his final job in the realm of politics, saying, \\"Anything else would be anticlimactic.\\" In regard to his post-political future, he said, \\"Maybe I'll write a screenplay, or maybe a fiction book based loosely on what all of this was like. You had a bunch of kids working on this campaign together, and it was such a mix of the serious and momentous and just the silly ways that we are. For people in my generation, it was an unbelievable way to grow up.\\" After the White House In March 2013, Favreau left the White House, along with Tommy Vietor, to pursue a career in private sector consulting and screenwriting. Together, they founded the communications firm Fenway Strategies. From 2013 to 2016, Favreau wrote sporadically for the Daily Beast. In 2016, after the November presidential election was won by Donald Trump, Favreau, Vietor and Jon Lovett founded Crooked Media. Favreau co-hosts Crooked’s premier political podcast Pod Save America with Dan Pfeiffer, Vietor and Lovett. In the wake of the new Republican healthcare bill, the AHCA, he coined the term \\"Wealthcare\\". He currently serves on the Board of Advisors of Let America Vote, a voting rights organization founded by fellow Crooked Media host Jason Kander. Accolades Favreau was named one of the \\"100 Most Influential People in the World\\" by Time magazine in 2009. In the same year he was ranked 33rd in the GQ \\"50 Most Powerful in D.C.\\" and featured in the Vanity Fair \\"Next Establishment\\" list. Favreau was one of several Obama administration members in the 2009 \\"World's Most Beautiful People\\" issue of People magazine. Controversies On December 5, 2008, a picture of Favreau grabbing the breast of a cardboard cut-out of then-Senator Hillary Clinton was posted on Facebook. Clinton had recently been announced as Obama's nominee for U.S. Secretary of State. Favreau called Senator Clinton’s staff to offer an apology. The Senator's office responded by joking that \\"Senator Clinton is pleased to learn of Jon's obvious interest in the State Department, and is currently reviewing his application.\\" In June 2010, the website FamousDC.com obtained a picture of Favreau along with Assistant White House Press Secretary Tommy Vietor, playing beer pong after taking off their shirts at a restaurant in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C.Nolongerfamous (2010-06-07)\\"WHITE HOUSE GONE WILD: Shirtless Favreau And Vietor's Sunday/Funday Beer Pong Match\\".

Playing career =Southampton= Gregory was born in Southampton and after playing youth football with Woolston Youth Club, he was signed by Southampton as a professional in December 1944. He made his first team debut as a replacement for Bill Rochford in a 3–1 defeat to Luton Town at a snow-covered Dell on 22 February 1947. Gregory spent most of his Southampton career in the reserves and his next first team appearance came on 23 September 1950. After another spell in the reserves, he replaced Norman Kirkman for the final five games of the season. He retained his place in the first team for the start of the following season, before giving way to Kirkman after four matches. He made the occasional appearance over the next few months, with a run of eight games from January to March as replacement for Peter Sillett, who had taken over at fullback from Kirkman. Gregory's best season for the Saints came in 1953–54 after they had been relegated to the Third Division South. He was appointed team captain and only missed four league matches during the season as Saints failed to make the expected return to Division Two. He then lost his place to Tommy Traynor and after another season in the reserves, he was given a free transfer to Leyton Orient in July 1955. In his ten years at the Dell, he made 68 appearances in all competitions, without scoring. In his final season at The Dell, Gregory was an ever-present member of the Southampton reserve team which won the Combination Cup under the management of Ted Bates. =Leyton Orient= At Orient, he joined another club playing in the Third Division South, and helped them to take the Division title in his first season with his new club. The following season, now back in the Second Division, Gregory only missed two league matches as Orient consolidated their position in mid-table. Gregory spent two more years at Brisbane Road before returning to the South coast in July 1959 to join Bournemouth, where he spent one season before retiring from professional football. Later career He then dropped down to non-league football, spending two years with Ashford Town, followed by a year with Hastings United. He then returned to Southampton where he managed Isle of Wight team Cowes Sports and then Southampton based Sholing Sports. He was employed in Southampton Docks as a boilermaker. He was married to Pauline and had four children. On 20 March 2008, it was reported that he had died.

It became the first game developed for a home system to be turned into an arcade game after Cinematronics, which was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy at the time, released it as their last color vector game. Gameplay The player controls a space ship armed with lasers and shields on a mission to destroy the Cosmic Chasm space station from the inside out. Each room of the space station has protector ships that attack the player directly and a center that slowly expands thus forcing the player not to linger in the room for too long after defeating the protector ships. The player must shoot away force fields that protect the exits in order to traverse the corridors that lead to other rooms. Each exit corresponds to a different direction on the map so choosing the shortest route is key. The goal is to fight your way to the station's reactor room, destroy it and make your way out of the station before being engulfed in the station's destruction. Touching the walls of the rooms is just as fatal as touching a protector ship or the expanding center. The screen has a map portion on top so that the player can keep track of which room of the station he is in as well as plan his escape out of the station. The home game is basically the same in game play but has some noticeable differences from the arcade version. Vectrex version differences In the Vectrex version the player controls a drilling vehicle that not only has lasers and shields but a drilling tip that must be used to penetrate and nullify the force-fields that block the exits. The rooms still have the protector ships, expanding center cores and in the one room; a reactor. The Vectrex version also has a map but it is not permanently displayed at the top of the screen like the arcade version. It is a separate screen that appears before each round of play begins or when the player exits a room. As well, in order to destroy the reactor, one must back their vehicle close to the reactor and drop a bomb which will explode after a preset time period, allowing you to make your escape. Finally, since this is a Vectrex game, it only features a monochrome vector display.

When they had their own label, they released an even greater production named Los Reyes De La Lenta: The ComeBack (2008). History The group first appeared in the late 1990s with DJ Joe. DJ Joe and Trebol Clan is the name that was given to this group halfway through 1997. Before that, Trebol Clan was composed of four people: DJ Joe, Berto, Hector and Omar. And their first musical appearances were on CDs titled “DJ Joe Vol. 3\\", \\"Rican Muffin\\", \\"DJ Joe Vol. 4, 5 and 6\\". Then, because of the chemistry that they had with DJ Joe, the latter decided in 2000 to be the musical producer of his first record company production titled, “DJ Joe y Trebol Clan – Los Genios Musicales”. Later, after the success of the CD, Omar entered the religious field and abandoned the group leaving only Hector, Berto and DJ Joe. For Trebol Clan, the success made them reach the production of “Fatal Fantassy” surpassing the 50,000 sold mark. Then the musical career of Trebol Clan continued after a series of takeovers by various artists record companies like “Gargolas (Vol. 2, 3, 4), “Fatal Fantassy (Vol. 1, 2, 3)”, “The Godfather”, \\"Buddha's Family\\", “Boricuas NY Vol. 2”, “Playero 42”, “Luny Tunes Mas Flow” (more than 150,000 copies sold) and Don Omar's \\"The Last Don\\" (more than 325,000 copies sold).

It is located on the south end of Wallowa Lake, and is a small community made up of vacation homes, lodging, restaurants, as well as other small businesses. History Wallowa Lake gained popularity among gold miners and soon began attracting guests from other areas. Seeing an emerging tourism market, entrepreneurs began building businesses at the lake. Among those built was the Wonderland Inn, now known as the Wallowa Lake Lodge. The Wonderland Inn was developed in 1923 as an amusement park at the south end of the lake. The park contained a restaurant, store, bowling alley, dance hall, outdoor movie theater, horse drawn carousel and cabins for those wishing to stay overnight. An 18-passenger boat carried the guests who arrived in Joseph (which lies at the north end of the lake) down the entire four mile stretch of Wallowa Lake, finally arriving at the inn and amusement park. The amusement park operated until 1940, when snowfall from an unusually harsh winter crushed most of the buildings and rendered the park inoperable. However, the inn survived the winter and still remains in operation, though renamed the Wallowa Lake Lodge.http://www.wallowalakelodge.com/historywll.htm Retrieved on March 25, 2009 The area at the south end of the lake continued to be developed commercially. Several more stores, lodges, restaurants, and rental cabins were built in the following years, turning the south end of the lake into a tourist community. The businesses at the south end of Wallowa Lake are members of a non-profit tourism association. This association maintains a website, supports tourism in the area and works to solve issues across the lake community. There are 2,000 to 3,000 people residing at the south end of Wallowa Lake in summer with all businesses open. However, from October through March there are less than 40 year-round residences at the south end of the lake, and only a few lodging businesses remain open. Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 62 people, 37 households, and 19 families residing in the CDP.

He reigned over the Rashidun empire which extended from Central Asia in the east to North Africa in the west. He became known as a both just and fair ruler. Selection as Caliph Ali is credited as the first male to convert to Islam. After the assassination of the third Caliph, Uthman Ibn Affan, at the close of the Siege of Uthman, the selection of a new Caliph encountered difficulties. The rebels, comprising Muhajerin, Ansar, Egyptians, Kufans and Basntes, and the Kharijites, were divided between three candidates: Ali, Talhah and Al-Zubayr. First they referred to Ali and asked him to accept the caliphate. Also some Sahaba tried to persuade him to accept the office.Nahj Al-Balagha Sermon 3 * For Isnad of this sermon and the name of the names of scholars who narrates it see Nahjul Balagha, Mohammad Askari Jafery (1984), pp. 108-112See: * Ashraf (2005), p. 119 * Madelung (1997), pp. 141-143 But he refused and answered:'Leave me and seek someone else. We are facing a matter which has (several) faces and colors, which neither hearts can stand nor intelligence can accept. Clouds are hovering over the sky, and faces are not discernible. You should know that if I respond to you I would lead you as I know and would not care about whatever one may say or abuse. If you leave me then I am the same as you are. It is possible I would listen to and obey whomever you make in charge of your affairs. I am better for you as a counselor than as chief.'Hamidullah (1988), p.126دَعُونِي وَ اِلْتَمِسُوا غَيْرِي فَإِنَّا مُسْتَقْبِلُونَ أَمْراً لَهُ وُجُوهٌ وَ أَلْوَانٌ لاَ تَقُومُ لَهُ اَلْقُلُوبُ وَ لاَ تَثْبُتُ عَلَيْهِ اَلْعُقُولُ وَ إِنَّ اَلْآفَاقَ قَدْ أَغَامَتْ وَ اَلْمَحَجَّةَ قَدْ تَنَكَّرَتْ وَ اِعْلَمُوا أَنِّي إِنْ أَجَبْتُكُمْ رَكِبْتُ بِكُمْ مَا أَعْلَمُ وَ لَمْ أُصْغِ إِلَى قَوْلِ اَلْقَائِلِ وَ عَتْبِ اَلْعَاتِبِ وَ إِنْ تَرَكْتُمُونِي فَأَنَا كَأَحَدِكُمْ وَ لَعَلِّي أَسْمَعُكُمْ وَ أَطْوَعُكُمْ لِمَنْ وَلَّيْتُمُوهُ أَمْرَكُمْ وَ أَنَا لَكُمْ وَزِيراً خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ مِنِّي أَمِيراً Sermon 91 Then rebels offered the caliphate to Talhah and Al-Zubayr and some other companions but they refused it too. Therefore, they threatened that, unless the people of Medina choose a caliph within one day, they would be forced to take some drastic action. In order to resolve the deadlock all of the Muslims gathered in Mosque of Prophet on 18 June 656CE. (25th Dhu al-Hijjah 35AH.) to choose the caliph. Ali refused to accept caliphate by the fact that the people who pressed him hardest were the rebels, and he therefore declined at first. When the notable companions of Muhammad as well as people who live in Medina urged him, however, he finally agreed. According to Abu Mekhnaf's narration Talhah was the first prominent companion who gave his pledge but the other narrations claim they didn't do so or even somebody forced them to do so. However he and Al-Zubayr later claimed they did so reluctantly, but Ali refused this claim and said that they did so voluntarily. Mudelong believe that force was not used to urge people to give their pledge and they pledged in public in the mosque. See: * Ashraf (2005), pp. 119-120 * Madelung (1997), pp. 141-145 While the overwhelming majority of people who lived in Medina as well as rebels gave their pledge, some major figures did not. Umayyads, kins of Uthman, escaped to Levant or remained in their houses and later refused Ali's legitimacy. Sa\`ad ibn Abi Waqqas were absent and Abdullah ibn Umar abstained from offering his allegiance but both of them assured Ali that they wouldn't do anything against Ali. See: * Ashraf (2005), pp. 119-120 * Madelung (1997), pp. 141-145 * Nahj Al-Balagha Sermons 3, 136, 227, Another prominent figure who was in Mecca at that time and later opposed Ali, was A'isha, Muhammad's widow. Reign as Caliph thumbright300pxDomains of Rashidun empire under four caliphs. The divided phase relates to Ali caliphate. At the beginning Ali told people that Muslim polity had come to be plagued by dissension and discord and he wanted to purge Islam of all evil from which it had come to suffer. Then warned all concerned that he would tolerate no sedition and all found guilty of subversive activities would be dealt with harshly. He advised people to behave as true Muslims.Ashraf (2005), p. 121 But he soon found that he was helpless and the prisoner of the people who didn't obey him. The caliphate had come to him as the gift of the rebels and he didn't have enough force to control or punish them. When some people asked Ali to punish those who killed Uthman, Ali answered, \\"How do I have the power for it while those who assaulted him are in the height of their power. They have superiority over us, not we over them.\\" وَلكِنْ كَيْفَ لي بِقُوَّة وَالْقَوْمُ الْـمُجْلبُونَ عَلَى حَدِّ شَوْكَتِهِمْ، يَمْلِكُونَنَا وَلاَ نَمْلِكُهُمْ Nahj Al-Balagha, sermon 167 While A'isha, Talhah, Al-Zubayr and Umayyad especially Muawiyah I wanted to take revenge for Uthman's death and punish the rioters who had killed him. However some historians believe that they use this issue to seek their political ambitions due to finding Ali's caliphate against their own benefit.Tabatabae (1979), p. 191 See: * Madelung (1997), pp.147 and 148 * Nahj Al-Balagha Sermons 22, 136 , Letter 37 Soon after Ali became caliph, he dismissed provincial governors who had been appointed by Uthman, and replaced them with trusted aides. He acted against the counsel of Mughrah ibn Shobah and Ibn Abbas, who had advised him to proceed cautiously. Madelung says Ali was deeply convinced of his right and his religious mission, unwilling to compromise his principles for the sake of political expediencey, ready to fight against overwhelming odds. Muawiyah, kinsman of Uthman and governor of Levant refused to submit to Ali's orders - the only governor to do this.See: * Madelung (1997), pp.148 and 149 After the Battle of Bassorah Ali transferred his capital from Medina to Kufa, the Muslim garrison city in Iraq. Kufa was in the middle of Islamic land and had strategic position.'Ali Ali resumed the land which had been granted by Uthman and swore to resume whatever some elites had taken before him. He opposed the centralization of capital control over provincial revenues and favored an equal distribution of taxes and booty among the Muslims; in contrast to Umar he distributed the entire revenue of the divan among Muslims without keeping anything in reserve. When asked to pay more money to elites he said \\"Do you command me that I should seek support by oppressing those over whom I have been placed? By Allah, I won't do so as long as the world goes on, and as long as one star leads another in the sky. Even if it were my property, I would have distributed it equally among them, then why not when the property is that of Allah.\\"Lapidus (2002), p. 46; Nahj al- Balagha Sermon 15, 125 لمّا عوتب على تصييره الناس أسوة في العطاء من غير تفضيل إلى السابقات والشرف، قال: أَتَأْمُرُونِّي أَنْ أَطْلُبَ النَّصْرَ بِالْجَوْرِ فِيمَنْ وُلِّيتُ عَلَيْهِ! وَاللهِ لاَ أَطُورُ بِهِ مَا سَمَرَ سَميرٌ، وَمَا أَمَّ نَجْمٌ فِي السَّمَاءِ نَجْماً! لَوْ كَانَ الْمَالُ لي لَسَوَّيْتُ بَيْنَهُمْ، فَكَيْفَ وَإِنَّمَا الْمَالُ مَالُ اللهِ لَهُمْ. Ali believed that people and governors have rights over each other and God created these rights so as to equate with one another. The greatest of these rights that Allah has made obligatory is the right of the ruler over the ruled and the right of the ruled over the ruler. If the ruled fulfill the rights of the ruler and the ruler fulfills their rights, then right attains the position of honor among them, the ways of religion become established, signs of justice become fixed and the sunnah gains currency. He wrote directions for his officials which clearly show what form of regime he wanted to introduce. It was not to be a regime whose officers had an upper hand and were fattened on public money. It was to be a regime where the governed and the tax-payers were at premium. It was their convenience for which the State was to function. It was a welfare-state working solely for the welfare of the people living under its rule, a regime where the rich cannot get richer while the poor are made poorer; a regime where canons of religion hold the balance between the governed and the ruler. He asked people not to speak with him as they spoke with cruel governors and be honest with him. Nahj al-Balagha Sermon 215 Letters 25, 26, 27, 40, 41, 43, Ali had decisive beliefs that he shouldn't start a war with other Muslims but when the enemy started it his army wouldn't retreat unless they wanted to attack again. He ordered his soldiers not to kill who would become injured, or not be able to defend himself, or escape from the battlefield and injuries and wanted his warriors not to injure women.Nahj al-Balagha Letter 14 First Fitna The First Fitna, 656-661 CE, followed the assassination of the caliph Uthman Ibn Affan, continued during the caliphate of Ali, and was ended, on the whole, by Muawiyah's assumption of the caliphate. This civil war is often called the Fitna, and regretted as the end of the early unity of the Islamic ummah (nation). Ali was first opposed by a faction led by Talhah, Al-Zubayr and Muhammad's wife, Aisha bint Abu Bakr. This group was known as disobedients (Nakithin) by their enemies. First they gathered in Mecca then moved to Basra with the expectation of finding the necessary forces and resources to mobilize people in what is now Iraq. The rebels occupied Basra, killing many people. When Ali asked them for obedience and a pledge of allegiance, they refused. The two parties met at the Battle of Bassorah (Battle of the Camel) in 656, where Ali emerged victorious.See: * Lapidus (2002), p.47 * Holt (1977a), p.70 - 72 * Tabatabaei (1979), p.50 - 53 * Nahj Al-Balagha Sermons 8, 31, 171, 173, Then he appointed Ibn Abbas governor of Basra and moved his capital to Kufa. Later he was challenged by Muawiyah I, the governor of Levant and the cousin of Uthman, who refused Ali's demands for allegiance and called for revenge for Uthman. Ali opened negotiations with him with the hope of regaining his allegiance but Muawiyah insisted on Levant autonomy under his rule. Muawiyah replied by mobilizing his Levantine supporters and refusing to pay homage to Ali on the pretext that his contingent had not participated in his election. The two armies encamped themselves at Siffin for more than one hundred days, most of the time being spent in negotiations. Although, Ali exchanged several letters with Muawiyah, he was unable to dismiss the latter, nor persuade him to pledge allegiance. Skirmishes between the parties led to the Battle of Siffin in 657. After a week of combat was followed by a violent battle known as laylat al-harir (the night of clamor) the Muawiyah's army were on the point of being routed when Amr ibn al-Aas advised Muawiyah to have his soldiers hoist mushaf (either parchments inscribed with verses of the Qur'an, or complete copies of it) on their spearheads in order to cause disagreement and confusion in Ali's army.Lapidus (2002), p. 47; Holt (1977a), p. 70 - 72; Tabatabaei (1979), p. 53 - 54; Nahj Al-Balagha Sermons 43, 54, 56, 67, 68 . The two armies finally agreed to settle the matter of who should be Caliph by arbitration. The refusal of the largest bloc in Ali's army to fight was the decisive factor in his acceptance of the arbitration. The question as to whether the arbiter would represent Ali or the Kufans caused a further split in Ali's army. Ash'ath ibn Qays and some others who later became the Kharijites rejected Ali's nominees, \`Abd Allah ibn \`Abbas and Malik al-Ashtar, and insisted on Abu Musa Ash'ari, who was opposed by Ali, since he had earlier prevented people from supporting him. Ali was urged to accept Abu Musa but he never did. Those who preferred Abu Musa went decided to continue with the arbitration anyway. The Kharijites (schismatics), later opposed the decision to choose Abu Musa blaming Ali for his appointment and rebelled and Ali had to fight with them in the Battle of Nahrawan. The arbitration resulted in the dissolution of Ali's coalition and some have opined that this was Muawiyah's intention.Madelung (1997), pp. 241 - 259; Lapidus (2002), p. 47; Holt (1977a), pp. 70 - 72; Tabatabaei (1979), pp. 53 - 54; Nahj Al-Balagha Sermons 40, 58, 59, 78, 121, 124, 126 Muawiyah's army invaded and plundered cities, which Ali's governors couldn't prevent and people didn't support him to fight with them. Muawiyah overpowered Egypt, Yemen and other areas. See: Nahj Al-Balagha Nahj Al-Balagha Sermons 25, 27, 29, 39 * Al-gharat (Plunders) which has written by Abi Mikhnaf is a detailed report about these raids. This civil war created permanent divisions within the Muslim community and Muslims were divided over who had the legitimate right to occupy the caliphate.See: * Lapidus (2002), p.47 * Holt (1977a), p.72 * Tabatabaei (1979), p.57 Death Zulfiqar with and without the shield. The Fatimid depiction of Ali's sword as carved on the Gates of Old Cairo, namely Bab al-Nasr. On the nineteenth of Ramadan, while Ali was praying in the mosque of Kufa, the Kharijite Abd-al-Rahman ibn Muljam assassinated him with a strike of his poison-coated sword. Ali, wounded by the poisonous sword, lived for two days and died on the 21st of Ramadan in the city of Kufa in 661 CE.Tabatabae (1979), page 192 Ali ordered his sons not to kill a group of people. Since the act was performed by a single member of Kharijite group and not all of them, they had to revenge just the murderer.Kelsay (1993), p. 92 Thus later Hasan fulfilled Qisas and killed ibn Muljam.Madelung (1997), p.309 In these two days he dictated his will to his household \\"My advice to you is that you should not consider anyone as a co- worker of the Lord, be firm in your belief that there is One and only One Allah. Do not waste the knowledge given to you by the Muhammad and do not give up and destroy his Sunnah [traditions]. Keep these two pillars of Islam [monotheism and Sunnah of the Muhammad] aloft.

(now known as Buildup Entertainment) and distributed by Bandai. The film is actually made up of three short acts serving as a kind of television format. The series was unique as it didn't follow any type of manga, anime, or tokusatsu archetype. Instead, it served as an antithesis for those motifs. However, the series does pay some homage to the Super Robot genre. Furthermore, the series story is targeted more towards adults rather than children; in addition, the overall story is depicted as being \\"mean-spirited\\". Plot Kawamata is a psychotic soldier who fell in with the Russian Special Operation Forces. It was at this time that Kawamata became the guinea pig for this secret scientific research organization. The Russians wanted to ensure that they were ahead of the U.S. in the arms race, and used this organization to develop a mobile combat suit, armed to the teeth with all kinds of weapons imaginable. During his tenure on the project, Kawamata met Matsuzaki, a twisted scientist who was kicked out of Japan for unscrupulous practices. Matsuzaki became lead engineer on the combat suit project and coded Kawamata’s thought impulses into the control mechanism, so only he can operate the walking arsenal. But when Communist Russia collapsed, Kawamata and Matsuzaki stole the armored battle suit and snuck it into Japan. =Acts= * Act I Kawamata, a former special forces, who becomes a mercenary for hire. In this part of the story we explore the mind of Kawamata, a wealthy man and an avid collector of military weapons. The monster in Act I is called the Dad Monster, according to Buildup. This monster is a businessman who was infected by the parasite ooze when he got too close to the meteor. He slowly began to turn into a monster; first brutally killing his wife and daughter…then feasting on both them.. Finally, he fully developed into the Dad Monster and goes on a killing spree; shredding people and biting victims in half. Kawamata heard of the monster and was excited to finally test his newly upgraded combat suit. After a couple of minutes of mindless destruction, Kawamata comes out triumphant against the Dad Monster by ripping him to shreds with his trusty machine gun…however…he kills 40+ innocent bystanders in the process. * Act II A year has passed since Kawamata single handedly vanquished the Dad Monster and killed many innocent bystanders in the process. Although he destroyed the monster, Kawamata was sentenced to death for the massacre in Shinjuku, however, the charges against him would be dropped if he cooperated with the government and used the combat suit to fight the meteor monsters, he reluctantly agrees. While in prison, he befriended a fellow inmate named Iba; it seemed that many of the prisoners feared Kawamata or hated him., but Iba didn't fear him because he loved weapons as much as Kawamata did. When a meteor crashes in the suburbs, the parasite ooze infects a chicken which began to eat livestock and the farmer before it ran into the city. The creature starts attacking an amusement park and Kawamata is quickly dispatched to intercept the monster. During the fight, Kawamata loses a leg and an arm; struggling, he barely managed to fight back and defeat the monster. * Act III Sergei and his commandos arrived in Japan to kill Kawamata for stealing one of Russia’s combat suits. Meanwhile, Kawamata’s limbs were replaced by the government. In addition, he began to feel sick and tired of fighting for the government and chose Iba as his successor to the combat suit. Sergei arrived at Kawamata’s home and successfully killed him despite Iba’s attempts to protect his mentor. Suddenly, another meteor appeared and was secured by Sergei’s commandoes, but in a freak accident, the meteor thawed from its confinement and the ooze infected Sergei turning him into the Combat Suit Monster and went on a rampage and ate the other commandos. Now it was up to Iba to fight this beast. The end of the movie ended in a cliffhanger, where Kawamata’s brain is preserved for study; further denying him any peace even after death. Characters * Kawamata - A mercenary, always ready for battle, but when the Cold War ended, he had to wait until it was time for combat once more. Before the Cold War ended, he stole a combat suit from the USSR and escaped to Japan. He is eventually killed by Sergei and his unit near the end of the movie. * Matsuzaki - He is Kawamata’s sidekick, so to speak. Originally, an engineer who developed the designs for the combat suit. When he and Kawamata escaped to Japan, he upgraded the combat suit to Type D status, which is far stronger than the \\"Type C\\" combat suits the Russians had. He was somewhat of a mad scientist. He and Kawamata are not friends who share a shaky business relationship. * Tanaka - A government agent who was assigned to lead a special task force against the meteor monsters. * Iba - He was Kawamata’s cellmate in prison and successor to the Type D combat suit. He was appointed to succeed Kawamata as combat suit pilot by Kawamata himself. * Yuriko - A woman who was saved from the Yakuza by Kawamata and now aggressively follows him. * Sergei - The commander of the Russian Combat Suit Force who utterly despises Kawamata and comes to Japan to kill him for stealing one of the combat suits. He’s far more psychotic and dangerous than Kawamata himself. Combat Suit \\"Type D\\" =Background= The Combat Suit was originally developed by the Russian Special Forces and acts sort of like a mobile tank. It was created due to Russia and America's arms race during the Cold War. When the Soviet Union collapsed, the project was rendered obsolete. During its manufacturing, Russia was only able to get their Combat Suit line up to \\"Type C\\" status. Kawamata and Matsuzaki steals one of the Russian \\"Type C\\" Combat Suits after the collapse and escape to Japan. There, it was given modifications and upgrades including the latest control devices, gun tracks, and turbine engines. In addition, the suit was programmed to be piloted by Kawamata only and served as a fail safe should anyone else attempt to take it. =Statistics= * Height: 6.8 feet * Weight: 375 lbs. =Armament= * MM-1 Grenade Launcher * AK-47 \\"Customized Kawamata Special\\" * M-82A1 Anti-Materiel Rifle * M-60 GPMG * AT-4 Rocket Launcher Meteor Monsters Meteor Monsters are alien parasites that are concealed within mysterious meteors that crash to Earth. They start as amoeba-like living ooze. When it attaches itself to another living organism, it completely takes over its host and begins to devour anything around it causing it to grow into enormous size. * \\"Dad\\" Monster – The meteor monster featured in Act I. He was originally a stressed- out businessman that witnesses a meteor crash. While investigating the crash site, an amoeba emerges from the meteor and attaches to him. When returning home to his nagging wife, he goes insane and murders her. Afterwards, he devours her and later his own daughter. Now with the urge to consume, he begins to grow and later attacks the city to feed. It is armed with powerful fangs and tusks as well as claws. * Chicken Monster – The meteor monster featured in Act II. The monster came to be when a meteor crashed by a nearby farm where the amoeba then attached itself to a chicken. As a result, it began attacking and devouring the other livestock and eventually attacked and ate the farmer. The monster then ran off into the city where it attacked an amusement park. It is armed with a powerful beak which can even penetrate the Combat Suit's armor. * Combat Suit Monster – The meteor monster featured in Act III. Kawamata's nemesis, Sergei, becomes this monster after an accident which thawed a captured amoeba that was in possession of Sergei's unit. After it escapes, it bonds with Sergei driving him mad resulting in Sergei devouring his own unit. Iba, Kawamata's successor, is sent to combat the newly born monster before it goes out of control. It is armed with an extending mandible and covered with Combat Suit armor.

Life James Apjohn (1796-1886) was a renowned and respected chemist and physicist who lived and worked in Dublin during the 1800s. He was known internationally for his work on hygrometry and the Apjohn dewpoint. A mineral from Algoa Bay, South Africa, which proved to be an effloresced manganese alum was analysed and described by Apjohn to great acclaim. Subsequently, it was named 'Apjohnite' in his honour. Apjohn was born on 1 September 1796 at his father's property, Sunville, in Pallasgrean, Co. Limerick. He attended the Tipperary Grammar School for four years before entering Trinity College Dublin in 1813 as a sizar under the tutorship of Rev. Dr. Wall. Apjohn graduated with a B.A in 1817 and took his degree of M.B in 1821.\\"Alumni Dublinenses : a register of the students, graduates, professors and provosts of Trinity College in the University of Dublin (1593–1860 George Dames Burtchaell/Thomas Ulick Sadleir p15: Dublin, Alex Thom and Co, 1935 His debút as a lecturer on science took place in the Royal Cork Institution in 1824 where he succeeded Edmund Davy as Professor of Chemistry after which went on to become the Professor of Chemistry at the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland. He continued lecturing throughout his career and was popular for his lucid style and well-devised experiments. In some cases, his lectures were so well attended that a larger venue had to be found to accommodate all those wishing to attend. Many of the greatest names in Irish medicine were connected with this school and by some, it was seen as a 'nursery' for RCSI professors. Apjohn was appointed Lecturer in Chemistry and stayed in that position until 1828 when he was elected Professor of Chemistry in the RCSI. He held this professorship which was created with his appointment for 22 years. Apjohn became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1829 and a Fellow in 1831. Throughout his career, Apjohn was associated with the Royal Irish Academy (RIA). He regularly submitted papers on chemistry, electricity, mineralogy etc. to the RIA's proceedings. The year 1837 was to be an important one for Apjohn. Not only did he qualify as M.D from Trinity but he was also awarded the Cunningham Medal by the Royal Irish Academy for his paper 'Upon a New Method of Investigating the Specific Heat of Gases'. This is the highest honour the institute can bestow. As stated on the RIA website The Cunningham Medal is considered to be the Academy's premier award established to recognise the outstanding contribution to scholarship and the objectives of the Academy by a Member. It is awarded at three-yearly intervals... In 1841 he was appointed Lecturer on Applied Chemistry in Trinity. Nearly a decade later on the death of Dr. F.Baker, Apjohn was made Chair of Chemistry. On 2 June 1853 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. By 1855 the Professorship of Mineralogy was amalgamated into this Chair. Apjohn published a Manuel of Metalloids in 1864 which was widely received by scientists of the time. During his time in Trinity he represented the College on the General Medical Council. He finally retired from lecturing at the age of 78. James Apjohn died in Blackrock, Co.

It is not to be confused with Matsuyama Castle in Matsuyama, Ehime Prefecture. Along with being one of only twelve remaining original castles in the country, Bitchū Matsuyama Castle is notable as the castle with the highest elevation above sea level in Japan at 430 meters (1410 ft).  History  The site of the lord's palace The castle was originally built on a nearby mountain (Omatsuyama) in 1240 AD by Akiba Shigenobu. Takahashi Muneyasu constructed a castle on the modern site on Mount Gagyū in 1331, though the design of this castle differed from the one that stands on the site now.Bitchu-Matsuyama Castle When Mimura Motochika became the feudal lord of the region, Matsuyama castle was enlarged again and the site extended to cover the entire mountain. With assistance from the Mōri clan, Mimura Motochika conquered the whole Bitchu area and defended it against the Amako clan. Motochika later entered into secret communications with the Oda, and having come to the attention of the Mōri, they forced him from the castle and died in the escape.Samurai-Archives In 1600, the castle became part of the Bitchū-Matsuyama Domain where Kobori Masatsugu and his son Masakazu came to the area as officers of the Tokugawa shogunate and repaired the castle as part of the efforts to turn Matsuyama into a castle town. In 1617, Ikeda Nagayoshi was transferred here as the new lord of Bitchū-Matsuyama Domain and was followed by Ikeda Nagatsune, who ruled until 1641. The next feudal lord, Mizunoya Katsutaka, rebuilt the donjon (keep), turrets and other gates in addition to building Onegoya house on the southern side of Mount Gagyu where public affairs were administered. The Mizunoya clan ruled here until 1695 where it was transferred again to the Andō clan and the Ishikawa clan in 1711. The tenshu was unusual in that it was only two stories tall, though a larger tenshu along the lines of Himeji Castle's would have been unnecessary as Bitchu Matsuyama Castle was located on a mountain, thus allowing a large field of vision. The lord's palace was constructed at the base of the mountain. Itakura Katsuyoshi became lord in 1744, and eight descendants of his ruled the castle until the Meiji Restoration. After the Edo period had ended, the castle was partly destroyed, but the rest of it was abandoned and slowly fell into disrepair. In 1929, a citizens' group was established and restoration work was begun on the castle. After this work was completed, the Takahashi City authorities repaired the keep's turret, and mud walls. Three parts were saved and still stand today: a short section of wall, the Nijū yagura, and the tenshu.  Today  In recent years, parts of the castle have been reconstructed to augment the parts that remain, all of which have been named Important Cultural Properties in 1950 by the National Government. In 1957 the government began restoring the castle to its original state and was completed by 1960. It is also a popular place to visit because it is the only yamashiro, or mountain castle, to have an original tenshu. The castle is on a mountain and the road up to the summit does not go all the way, so to get to the castle, one must hike up a mountain path.

A PlayStation 2 port was in development, but was cancelled early in production. It was a commercial hit, with sales of 500,000 units by 1999. Gameplay Combat in Dark Earth. Dark Earth is a third-person game centered around item-collection and weapon-based melee combat. The game world is filled with a variety of different weapons which can be used until broken, requiring a constant need to expand the main character Arkhan's weapon collection. The vast majority of the weapons are scavenged or improvised, such as kitchen knives and shivs. There are a very limited number of guns in Dark Earth, as most people have forgotten about firearms. For the select few guns Arkhan finds, there is an equally limited amount of ammo, making guns good for only a limited time. Arkhan must also scavenge for food, as it is his only means of healing. As time progresses in Arkhan's quest, he slowly begins to transform into a creature of darkness. His physical appearance, the tone of his voice, and his dialog choices change throughout the course of the game. There is also an option for Arkhan to react to situations with his 'dark side' (i.e. he'll say rude things in dialog or treat his environment more aggressively while searching). The environments of the game are all pre-rendered, with 3D modeled characters moving atop them (much like Resident Evil). This method, while allowing for more detailed environments, prevents any camera control. All locations have fixed-camera views, which can create difficulty in some fight situations in small areas. Story =Background= Dark Earth takes place several centuries in the future, when a meteor collision with Earth (referred to as the \\"Great Cataclysm\\") has thrown up great clouds of ash and dust, blocking out the light of the sun. Those not killed in the collision were soon hunted by strange creatures of darkness, and so they began to seek a refuge from the \\"Dark Earth\\" - pockets of land where the light of the sun breached the clouds. Eventually they found such places. Called \\"Stallites\\", these places of light became cities, and the survivors built temples in honor of the light. The game is set in a Stallite called Sparta. By the time of the game, many centuries after the establishment of Sparta, most of the citizens have forgotten their history and now worship the light as a god, Solaar. The city is run by Sunseers, priests of Solaar, who maintain order and prevent the creatures of darkness from entering the city limits. The game focuses on Arkhan, a \\"Guardian of Fire\\", one of the military protectors of the city. =Plot= The game begins with Arkhan awakening from a nightmare in which he has a vision of the Great Cataclysm and sees it foretold that a great darkness will threaten Sparta, which he must fight against. He then goes to see the head of the Guardians of Fire, Provost Dhorkan, who orders him to guard the council chamber door at the Temple of Solaar, while the High Sunseer Lory is holding a meeting. On his way to the Temple, Arkhan overhears his father Rylsadhar, also a Sunseer, telling Lory that he fears a great danger is about to engulf Sparta. He gives Lory something, telling her he doesn't feel safe carrying it himself. Arkhan takes his post, but hears a commotion from within the council room. He bursts in to find the Sunseers under attack by two men, one of whom he kills. The other is about to attack Lory, but Arkhan intervenes, and the man throws something in his face and flees. Lory examines Arkhan and sees that he has been contaminated by \\"Shankr Archessence.\\" Arkhan awakens some time later, and is horrified to discover that he has begun to turn into a creature of darkness. A healer, Thanandar, tells him that he is infected with darkness and the only way to save him is a \\"secret energy from the dawn of time.\\" Thanandar says that Rylsadhar is one of the few people in Sparta who knows where it is located. Arkhan goes to see Rylsadhar, who tells him he is forbidden to bring him to the secret and must break his vows as a Sunseer to do so, but only after getting approval from Dhorkan. Arkhan then sees Kalhi, his wife, who is horrified at what has happened to him and tells him that Dhorkan has taken control of the city, declared martial law, locked the gates, and sent the Guardians of Fire out to search for more attackers. Arkhan heads to meet his father, but Rylsadhar doesn't arrive, so Arkhan sets out to look for him. He learns that Lory has gone into hiding and that his best friend, and fellow Guardian, Zed, is leading the hunt for more \\"heretics\\" in the Lower City. Arkhan then learns that Rylsadhar has disappeared, and the Guardians of Fire have arrested Kalhi. He breaks her out of jail and they head to the Lower City to see their friend, the scavenger Danrys, who tells them that they need to speak to a man named Armal Sadak, the chief scavenger. Sadak tells Arkham that the people who attacked the Sunseers are a group of thugs known as the Konkalites who live in the sewers. However, they did so on the orders of someone else, although Sadak doesn't know who. He also recommends that Arkhan find Leona, a hermit who lives outside Sparta in the Dark Earth. Whilst Kalhi remains with Danrys, Arkhan heads into the sewers and discovers that the Konkalites' leader, Sordos, is planning to take over the Upper City. Arkhan also learns that Sordos and Dhorkan are working together. However, Dhorkan is not the one behind the attack on the Sunseers. Sordos is in league with another Sunseer, who is behind everything. Arkhan then finds Sordos in conversation with Thanandar, who reveals he is holding Rylsadhar prisoner. Arkhan kills them both and enters the cells, finding Zed. Zed tells Arkhan that Thanandar is behind everything and seeks to find the ancient secret to destroy it and banish the light from Sparta forever. Zed then turns into a creature of darkness, and Arkhan is forced to kill him. Arkhan returns to the Upper City to confront Dhorkan, but he flees through a secret passage in his office. Arkhan pursues him down to the Lower City, where he encounters the resurrected Thanandar. He reveals that Rylsadhar drank the Archessence that fills Thanandar's soul, and now Rylsadhar has become Thanandar's servant. Thanandar sends Rylsadhar to destroy the Well of Light at the heart of the city. Rylsadhar does so, but dies in the process. Arkhan then meets Lory, who tells him that with the destruction of the Well of Light, the walls of the city no longer protect it from the creatures of darkness. She also tells him that the city has only one chance for salvation; Rylsadhar spent many years researching the origins of the light in the Well of Light. If Arkhan can continue Rylsadhar's research, he may find a way to save the city; beneath the city is a source of unlimited light, but it is dormant and needs to be activated - this is what Rylsadhar was researching. Lory gives Arkhan part of the key to Rylsadhar's vault (the item Rylsadhar gave to Lory earlier on) and urges him to find a way to access the light energy. Arkhan then sets about finding the rest of the key. He finds the first part with the city's Master Builder, Bandor, who tells him the other parts of the key are with Zed, and Leona. Arkhan finds and defeats Dhorkan, and then discovers a secret bunker from the time of the Great Cataclysm, containing hibernation pods and video files detailing how people tried to survive in the bunker after the meteor collision. He then meets a thief who is holding Zed's part of the key. Arkhan kills him and takes the key. As he moves around the city, Arkhan notes that everywhere, people are beginning to turn into creatures of darkness. He heads down into the sewers and finds Dhorkan dying in the Konkalite's prison. Dhorkan regrets his actions, realizing that he had been used by Sordos and Thanandar. He advises Arkhan not to face Thananadar, and that the poison thrown in Arkhan's face was actually Thanandar's blood. He dies, and Arkhan then discovers a secret underwater passage to outside of the city. He soon encounters Leona. Telling her that the Well of Light has been destroyed, that Rylsadhar is dead and that Thanandar is no longer human, Leona is shocked to hear of what has happened. She reveals that the secret of the Well of Light was known only to a few, known as Initiates, and that knowledge of it goes back to the dawn of time, millennia before the Great Cataclysm. The Well contains the Force of Light, and Rylsadhar was trying to find its source in a tomb deep below the city. Leona reveals that if the source can be found, the Force of Light will destroy the Force of Darkness in Thanandar, who, like Lory, Rylsadhar, Zed and Leona was an Initiate. She then gives him the final part of the key to Rylsadhar's vault. Arkhan heads back to the city, finding dead Guardians everywhere. A dying Guardian reveals that the creatures of darkness have entered Sparta. Arkhan enters Rylsadhar's vault and finds research on how to gain access to the Runka Tomb, the source of the Well of Light. Rylsadhar had discovered how to enter the tomb, but had been unable to find the door. However, using an explosive substance found in the bunker, Akhan is able to find the door, which was hidden in the center of the city. Now almost completely transformed into a creature of darkness, he enters the tomb. Navigating a series of traps, he reaches the center of the tomb, but realizes he has been followed by Thanandar, now transformed into a monster of darkness. Thanandar attempts to destroy the source of Light, but Arkhan blocks him. They fight, and Arkhan is able to defeat and destroy Thanandar. Arkhan then enters the source, which tells him it is time for the \\"Great Awakening\\" as a tower of light shoots into the sky high above the city, banishing the Darkness. Development Most of the work on the game was done at Mindscape's development house in Bordeaux, France. The characters' facial models were assembled from various parts (e.g. eyes, cheekbones) chosen from a collective character database, rather than being created from a single model. Kalisto's plans for a sequel to Dark Earth never came to fruition, although they did produce, in partnership with French publisher Multisim, a tabletop role- playing game based on the Dark Earth world. Although both Sony and Konami expressed publishing interest, a PlayStation 2 port of Dark Earth was canceled early in development. Reception =Sales= Dark Earth was a commercial hit, with global sales of 500,000 units by mid-1999. However, it failed commercially in the United States, where its sales totaled 54,200 units by April 1999. Microprose's Tom Nichols blamed this performance on competition from The Curse of Monkey Island and Blade Runner, which he said drew retailers away from stocking Dark Earth and customers away from buying it. He also noted that \\"we signed the game late in its development, so we didn't have enough time to build the preawareness and hype that you need ... today\\". =Reviews and awards= Dark Earth received generally positive reviews, and holds an aggregate score of 71% on GameRankings. It was named the best adventure game of 1997 by CNET Gamecenter, whose editors called it \\"beautifully conceived and executed\\" and an example of how \\"a superior adventure game is made\\". The game was also a finalist for the Software Publishers Association's 1997 \\"Best Adventure/Role-Playing Software Game\\" Codie award, which it ultimately lost to Diablo. GameSpot's Jeff Sengstack was very impressed, scoring the game 8 out of 10. Although he was critical of the fixed camera angles and the combat system, he wrote that \\"Dark Earth features superb graphics, outstanding 3D character animation, and unique action-adventuring in one beautifully crafted package. Adventurers longing for a deep and rich story, with carefully crafted characters, coupled with swashbuckling fighting action and challenging puzzles and problem solving, look no further.\\" They were especially impressed with the graphics, which they called \\"stunningly gorgeous. The shimmering colors, including translucent stained glass, are breathtaking. Each of the 100, fully 3D animated characters looks unique. As Arkhan and the other characters move, they change size to match the perspective, and the dynamic lighting sources throw properly proportioned shadows.\\" PC Zones Chris Anderson was also impressed, scoring it 82 out of 100, and praising the storyline; \\"Dark Earth is more of an interactive cinematic experience than a fully-fledged adventure game. This is no bad thing. The storyline is very convincing and unfolds seamlessly, with cut-scenes popping up at appropriate points in the proceedings to help everything along [...] the rich storyline alone will be enough to keep most people happy, and with the added diversions of hand-to- hand fisticuffs and puzzle-solving elements, Dark Earth offers a well-rounded gameplay experience that should appeal to many gamers who wouldn't normally be attracted to the adventure genre.\\" Game Revolution's Thomas Garcia scored the game B+. He also criticized the fixed camera angles during combat, but praised the graphics and controls, writing \\"Dark Earth is a great game and worth checking out. Its system requirements are quite low; that's an added plus for people with slow systems, and it is certainly not at the sacrifice of otherwise very high-quality graphics and sounds. All in all, Dark Earth is a good game with few flaws, and worth your hard earned money.\\" Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Dark Earth is one of the better graphic adventures, but the genre itself is getting stale, and this game can't help but to reflect that.\\" References External links * Category:1997 video games Category:Action- adventure games Category:Cancelled PlayStation 2 games Category:MicroProse games Category:Post-apocalyptic video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in France Category:Video games scored by Frédéric Motte Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Dark Earth (video game)"},{"id":"16724768","text":"Hesperolinon californicum is a species of flowering plant in the flax family known by the common name California dwarf flax.

SM City Bacolod is the 29th supermall of SM Prime Holdings, the 1st SM supermall in Negros Island Region and the 3rd in the Visayas. It opened on March 1, 2007 and currently has a total land area of and a total floor area of . SM City Bacolod is currently undergoing renovation and expansion that will be completed in phases. The first phase was completed in 2013, while the second phase was finished in October 2014.  Before Expansion  Originally, SM City Bacolod was composed of two one story wings (the North and the South). The mall size was before any further expansions. Each wing had one major hallway that fit all its stores at the time. Each side of the wing had two escalators that lead up to the bridges that connect the entire mall. The main food court was initially located in the South Wing before the second expansion in 2014. Mall Features SM City Bacolod mall is divided into two buildings called the \\"North Wing\\" and the \\"South Wing\\". The two buildings are connected by two bridge ways that allow patrons to walk between the two structures. Every entrance of the mall is guarded by a security guard. Some entrances have guards that carry a sensor to detect a firearm or another unwanted item inside the mall. Remaining entrances have a security guard present with a screening sensor a customer must walk through. Transportation The mall is very accessible by means of Jeep, tricycle and \\"padyak\\" or \\"pedicab\\" (pedicab is a bicycle with attached side car, much like a tricycle, though they are a silent version, and uses human pedal power to transport passengers.)  North Wing  The \\"North Wing\\" section of SM City Bacolod was the main focus of the recent renovation in 2016. Its expansion allowed for a \\"U-shaped\\" hallway to take place where the main entrance is located at the bottom of the letter. The main entrance from the north side of the wing includes restaurants and cafes, such as Krispy Kreme, BreadTalk, and Giligan's, for customers to dine in. Much of the city's festivities and holidays are centered at this section of the mall. For Christmas 2017, the mall incorporated a giant Christmas tree and various decorations to celebrate the holiday. During January 2018, this main entrance had an event, dubbed \\"Celebrations\\", for local businesses to offer their services to customers. = _1st Floor_ = The first floor of the \\"North Wing\\" is mostly composed of restaurants in its outer border. Restaurants can be located throughout the wing and to the connecting bridges. Most restaurants allow for indoor and outdoor entrance by customers of SM City Bacolod. The main department store (The SM Store) is also located in the northeast sector of the North Wing. Its area coverage is found throughout the first and second floor of the mall. Elevators, assisting customers reach the second and third floor, are located in the center area of the North Wing. Escalators are found in each side of the wing to assist customers to the second and third level as well. More stores are located near the bridge escalators. Many of the stores that functioned before the expansion are still present in the wing. = _2nd Floor_ = The second floor of the North Wing includes many clothing and technology companies. The outer section includes many clothing stores such as Nike, The North Face, and Columbia Sportswear. The center of the second floor includes the \\"SM CyberZone\\" and the mall's main food court. Gadgets for phones and computers can be purchased at the \\"SM CyberZone\\" where local and global businesses such as Samsung, Lenovo, and Apple, are selling these devices. The mall's food court is lined up with competitors (Sbarro, Four Seasons, and Kamay Kainan, and more) to feed hungry customers. The seating allows for customers to view the remaining floors of the \\"North Wing\\". This floor allows for direct access to the bridges that lead customers to the \\"South Wing\\". = _3rd Floor_ = The third floor of the wing cannot be accessed from any other entrance besides the elevators and escalators found below the other floors. The third floor is mostly fashion salons and stores. There are some cafes and small restaurants scattered throughout as well.  Arcades  Arcades are also located in this floor of the mall. World of Fun and Quantum offer people of all ages to play games and win prizes here. Students often attend these places after school or during the weekend. ;SMX Convention Center Bacolod With an area of 8,218 square metres, SMX Bacolod is located on the third floor of the Annex Building. SMX Bacolod offers 3 function rooms and 6 meeting rooms, totaling 4,269 square meters of leasable space that can accommodate anything from an audience of 5,000 to an exclusive conference for 10. SMX Convention Center Bacolod had its soft-opening on October 16, 2014 and its grand opening on November 23, 2014. SMX Bacolod hosted an APEC meeting last April 29–30, 2015, with its theme \\"Disaster Risk Finance – APEC Roadmap for Resilient Economies.\\"  South Wing  The \\"South Wing\\" has yet to be renovated or expanded. There is one main floor in this wing along with a second level to the entrance of the connecting bridges. Like the \\"North Wing\\", there are restaurants found on the outer section of the wing (Jollibee, KFC, and many more). Many home goods are bought in this wing due to stores such as Ace Hardware and The SM Appliance Store being present. = SM Cinemas = The SM Cinemas movie theatre is located on the southeast sector of the \\"South Wing\\". There is a total of four watchable theatres in this area. A food concessions stand is located right next to the ticket booth as well. Many films, including international movies, are premiered here due to the lack of stand-alone movie theatres in Bacolod City. = SM Supermarket = The SM Supermarket entrance is found in the south sector of the wing. There is another entrance located on the south side of the mall where most customers park (that are only going to the SM Supermarket). Canned, fresh, imported, and local food are sold in bulk at this market. Customers can also buy any items that aid in cooking or home cleaning. Many food stands are located right by the cashier section. Some of the food stand selection include Potato Corner and Zagu. SM Supermarket also offers services to hold personal belongings or bought goods for customers at the inner entrance of the store.  Connecting Bridges  There are two indoor bridges that allow for customers to explore the \\"North Wing\\" and the \\"South Wing\\" without being affected by weather conditions. The bridges are sealed with large glass windows to offer the view of Rizal Street as well as the Guimaras Strait. These bridges have numerous shops that sell sunglasses, watches, and accessories for customers. Also found on these bridges are salons, spa, and a barbershop (Jems Barber). Entrance from Rizal Street is offered to reach up to the connecting bridges. There is a singular staircase located halfway through each bridge. Expansion Plans bared by SM Prime Holdings will see a P2.5 billion three-storey expansion plan on both the North and South wings while the existing mall structure will be extended to two- storeys. The expansion will accommodate 150 more store tenants which is set to be completed in phases (some have already been opened). A new hotel named, Park Inn by Radisson Bacolod is also being constructed in SM City Mall. The hotel is planning to furnish 153 guest rooms, all connected to free Wi-Fi. This addition is planned to open in the third quarter of 2020.  Location  SM City Bacolod is conveniently located in the urban area of Bacolod City. From the connecting bridges of the two wings, one can witness the Guimaras Strait (West) and the San Sebastian Cathedral (East). The BREDCO port of Bacolod City is only 1 minute (1 kilometer) away from SM City Bacolod. Many hotels are near this mall including L'Fisher Hotel, Avenue Suites, Bacolod Business Inn, and many more.  Transportation  To arrive to SM City Bacolod, many customers take a taxi, a Jeepney, a tricycle, or a bus. The main drop off's for most vehicles are found in the \\"North Wing\\" entrance, the entrances by the bridges, and the \\"South Wing\\" entrance.  Mall Culture  There are more malls found in the Philippines than parks. The cultural nature of filipinos have influenced such events to take place at malls like SM. Due to the extremely hot temperatures in Southeast Asia, malls are a place where many filipinos flock and take shelter from the heat. The malls offer a place for filipinos to escape from their everyday work/school life.

He was later director of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. from 1987 to 1995. Career He was awarded a Ph.D in physics by Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1960. That same year he was granted a NATO postdoctoral fellowship at Cambridge University, followed in 1961 by a (US) National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellowship at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, In 1962 he joined the astronomy faculty at Cornell and was later appointed professor. His main interest lay in the building of telescopes to observe infrared radiation from space, which required the telescopes to be launched into orbit. He designed, built and launched the first rocket-powered liquid-helium-cooled telescopes in the late 1960s and also carried out astronomical observations from high-altitude NASA aircraft. In 1987 he was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society \\"in recognition of twenty-five years of outstanding contributions to theoretical and observational infrared astrophysics and for providing the leadership needed to create a coordinated space astrophysics program for the remainder of the century through the Great Observatory Program\\" In 1987, he moved from Cornell to be director of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC, where he organised the production of three wide-screen IMAX films, Blue Planet (1990), dealing with Earth, Destiny in Space, dealing with space exploration, and Cosmic Voyage, dealing with cosmic space and time.

Garth, whose seat was Haines Hill at Hurst in Berkshire, was the son of Charles Garth MP for Devizes and the government agent for the colonial provinces of South Carolina, Georgia and Maryland. He was also a nephew of General Thomas Garth, Colonel of the first dragoons and Principal Equerry to George III. Career Garth became a naval commander on 3 March 1804 and was promoted to captain in January 1808. In June 1809 was given the command of the 38-gun frigate HMS Imperieuse, with which he subsequently sailed in an expedition against Antwerp. After the reduction of Flushing, Garth was engaged in various operations on the river Scheldt. On 16 August 1809, whilst again in command of the Impérieuse, Garth in ascending the Scheldt after the other frigates, entered by mistake the Terneuse, instead of the Baerlandt channel, and became in consequence exposed to the fire of the Terneuse battery (located in Terneuzen, the Netherlands). In returning that fire, the frigate discharged from her carronades some shrapnel shells; one of which, bursting near the magazine of the fort, containing 3000 barrels of powder and a great quantity of cartridges, caused an explosion which killed 75 men. The battery fired no more, and the Impérieuse passed by. In the spring of 1810, Thomas Garth was put under the orders of Sir George Cockburn who had been sent to Quiberon Bay to work with Baron De Kolli, who was trying to arrange the release of Ferdinand VII of Spain, held at Valençay. In November of that year, Garth took command of the 22-gun HMS Cossack, and later of the 32-gun HMS Cerberus. In Cerberus he captured various armed ships and merchantmen in the Mediterranean. Family Garth married in 1820, Charlotte Maitland, daughter of General Frederick Maitland. They had two daughters one of whom, Charlotte Harriet Garth married Philip William Godsal of Iscoyd Park in Flintshire.
