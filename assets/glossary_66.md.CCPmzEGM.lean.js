He was a member of the Republican Party and served two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 29th district and 31st district of Pennsylvania. Early life and career McDowell was born in Pitcairn, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Randolph-Macon Military Academy in Front Royal, Virginia, in 1923. He was employed as a reporter on the Pitcairn Express in 1923 and worked on various newspapers until 1929. He was magistrate of Pitcairn from 1925 to 1928. He became editor of the Wilkinsburg Gazette in 1929 and president of the Wilkinsburg Gazette Publishing Co. in 1933. Political career In 1938, McDowell defeated incumbent James L. Quinn for a seat in the Seventy-sixth Congress, but was defeated after a single term by Samuel A. Weiss. He lost to Weiss in a rematch in 1942. In 1946, McDowell defeated Harry J. Davenport for a seat in the Eightieth Congress by just over 1,100 votes. It was a relatively narrow victory for a reliably Republican district. McDowell served on the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1947 and 1948 and was acting chairman when J. Parnell Thomas was not presiding. He initially investigated suspected fascists on the committee. In early 1948, he argued against granting a visa to boxer Max Schmeling who wanted to stage a comeback in the United States. The State Department later denied Schmeling the visa in that he did not meet any of the categories for granting visas to German citizens. Later, he played a role in the Alger Hiss case. The key witness, Whittaker Chambers, was ask to provide details about Hiss that few people would know. He mentioned that Hiss was a birdwatcher and had bragged about seeing a prothonotary warbler. In the hearing Richard Nixon asked Hiss about his hobbies, to which he replied tennis and amateur ornithology. McDowell interjected with a question as to whether Hiss had ever seen a prothonotary warbler, to which Hiss gushed in the hearing that he had indeed, seen one, and described it to the committee. This helped persuade the committee that Chambers was being truthful. On March 16, 1948, McDowell introduced a bill to grant the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives or the President of the United States Senate the power to obtain secret documents from any government agency. McDowell stated: The day before, U.S. President Harry S. Truman issued an executive directive, which barred Congress from just that. The Washington Post praised the President in an editorial, arguing \\"Every consideration of common sense backs it up as well, of course. The loyalty program would be meaningless if suspect employees were to be tried in newspapers and before congressional committees.\\" In October 1948, after indictments against 12 suspected communists in what would become the Foley Square trials, US Attorney John F. X. McGohey called on McDowell to appear before a grand jury in the case after McDowell charged that prosecutors deliberately drew up the indictments in such a way that the charges would not result in a conviction. McDowell later called McGohey and Attorney General Ramsey Clark \\"inept\\" in producing the indictments. In the 1948 election, Harry J. Davenport avenged his 1946 loss and defeated McDowell's bid for re-election. Personal life He was married to Virginia McDowell and had one daughter, Patricia.{{cite news url=https://www.nytimes.com/1957/12/12/archives/excongressman-commits- suicide-mcdowell-of-pennsylvania-had-active.html title=Ex-Congressman Commits Suicide work=New York Times date=1957-12-11}] After leaving Congress, McDowell continued to publish the Wilkinsburg Gazette.

Geography and administration Historically in Lancashire, Monton was administered by the municipal borough of Eccles until its abolition in 1974. The name Monton is of Saxon origin. A conservation area includes Monton Green; the Unitarian Church and a former school with caretaker's house; a lodge, built in 1875 to the Earl of Ellesmere's former estate, and a club-house with bowling green. The Green, once used as common land, is now formally laid out as gardens and lawns. Community The community is represented by the Monton Village Community Association, originally named the Monton Traders' Association, it was renamed to include both residents and traders. The association has a gardening group that maintains the flowerbeds and greens on a voluntary basis. The association organises an annual themed festival on the first Saturday of July each year and a parallel music festival which was in 2008 from 26 June to 6 July. The festival presents all genres of music from classical to Indie. The Monton Music Festival was then combined into the larger Salford Music Festival. Recently alongside the gentrification of Salford a number of popular bars and restaurants have opened up in the village attracting new trade into the village from the surrounding areas. Churches The Anglican church in Monton is dedicated to St Paul the Apostle. ;Monton Church, Monton Green, Eccles The present Unitarian Church is the fourth church on the site. It was built in the early 1870s and is renowned for its stained glass windows. The south transept shows the Sermon on the Mount with four smaller windows beneath depicting *Jesus in the Synagogue *Jesus with the Lady at the Well *The Good Samaritan *The Publican and the Pharisee. The north transept shows Jesus and Children-‚ÄòSuffer the Little Children'; and Jesus and Peter ‚Äì ‚ÄòFeed my Sheep'. The clerestory windows on the north side show famous men from the Greek, Roman, Renaissance and Modern periods. On the south side, the clerestory windows show representatives from the Early Christian, Roman Catholic, Anglican and nonconformist traditions. ;History After the Act of Uniformity 1662 Edmund Jones, Vicar of Eccles, was an ejected minister. He and others continued to meet in the Eccles area including Monks Hall. He was imprisoned for his non-conformity and his congregation reported to the local magistrate. He died in 1674. ;First chapel When William and Mary acceded to the throne, the Act of Toleration was passed which allowed nonconformity to be practised under licence. The Eccles Presbyterians appointed a minister and met in a series of private buildings. In 1698 the Lomax and Fildes families, long-term members of the congregation, bought a plot of land at Monton Green. A simple chapel was built and licensed in July 1698. ;Second chapel (1715‚Äì1802) In the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion a band of over 100 Jacobites, supporters of the Old Pretender, ransacked the church, having previously destroyed Cross Street Chapel in Manchester. The congregation claimed compensation from the government and rebuilt a bigger and better church. The Rev. Jeremiah Aldred was minister until his death in 1729. His tombstone can be seen in the churchyard. The congregation's religious views changed from Calvinism through Arianism to the appointment of their first Unitarian minister Harry Toulmin in 1786. In 1813 Unitarianism was legalised and the Nonconformists' Chapels Act 1844 secured the places of worship to Unitarians, allowing the congregation at Monton to officially call themselves Unitarians. ;Third chapel The second chapel was demolished around 1800. The third chapel was built in 1802 and survived until 1875 when the present church was built.A Short History of Monton Chapel (1662- 1802) by Ian McAlpine, 2008Monton Unitarian Church, Window history: A commentary on the Stained Glass windows Transport There was a railway station in Monton called Monton Green, which was part of the Tyldesley Loopline, running from Eccles through Worsley and Leigh to Roe Green. The station opened on 1 November 1887 and was closed under the Beeching Axe on 5 May 1969. Monton Green railway station was located on an embankment, just off Monton Green, the railway running parallel with the Bridgewater Canal. All traces of the station have long since been removed. However, the embankment on which the station was situated is still there and now forms the starting point of the Recreation Pathways scheme, run by Salford City Council. The loopline now forms part of cycle route 55. The village of Monton is now served by rail services passing through the railway stations at Patricroft and at Eccles, along the Manchester Victoria-Liverpool Lime Street railway line. Bus services also serve the village, while the nearest Metrolink station is in Eccles (approximately 15 minute walk). Landmarks Monton Veterans' Shelter The local landmarks include the Unitarian Church and the locally named \\"Old Man's Shelter\\" both on Monton Green. The Monton Shelter was completed in June 1930 following a campaign by the local vicar and a local Councillor for a shelter where 'Veterans of Industry' could meet during inclement weather. The shelter has recently been refurbished. A more recent addition is the Lighthouse built in recent years next to the Bridgewater Canal. Sport Monton & Weaste Cricket Club play in Ellesmere Park.

She was the oldest daughter of Gustav Vasa and Margareta Leijonhufvud. She was the autonomous Regent of and Norden in Ostfriesland (East Frisia) from 1599 to 1610.  Biography  Early life During her early childhood, she, as well as her siblings in the royal nursery, were primarily under the care of her mother the queen's trusted nurse, Brigitta Lars Anderssons, her mother's cousin lady Margareta and the noble widow Ingrid Amundsdotter.Tegenborg Falkdalen, Karin, Margareta Regina: vid Gustav Vasas sida : [en biografi √∂ver Margareta Leijonhufvud (1516-1551)], Setterblad, Stockholm, 2016 After the death of her mother in 1551, she as well as her siblings were placed in the care of Christina Gyllenstierna and then under her aunts Brita and Martha Leijonhufvud before her father's remarriage to Catherine Stenbock.Karin Tegenborg Falkdalen (2010). Vasad√∂ttrarna (The Vasa Daughters). Falun: Historiska Media. (In Swedish) In 1556, she and her sisters were given a dowry of 100.000 daler, had their portraits painted and their personal qualities described in Latin by the court poet Henricus Mollerus and were presented on the Dynastic marriage market. The same year, her father presented Ostfriesland with a trading treaty and a marriage alliance. Ostfriesland was chosen because it was strategically placed toward Denmark, and because the Calvinistic Emden was a rival to Lubeck and a treaty could break the domination of the Hanseatic league in Sweden. In 1557, the trading treaty was completed, and in 1558, Edzard visited Sweden to meet Catherine and her sister Cecilia and chose one of them to complete the marriage treaty. Edzard chose Catherine, but the negotiations took a long time, so much so that Gustav Vasa stated in his frustration that it was a blessing that his daughter was at least neither \\"limped or blind\\". Edzard's mother, the dowager Regent Anna of Oldenburg, was afraid that the marriage would lead to Swedish domination, and therefore split the power in Ostfriesland between her sons, something which the king tried to prevent. In the marriage contract of 12 August 1558, Catherine was assured Berum and Norden as her dower lands and the post of Regent if Edzard should be succeeded by an underage son of hers. The wedding took place in Stockholm 1 October 1559. In November, Catherine and Edzard left for Ostfriesland. Upon their journey through Sweden, they were accompanied by her sister Cecilia and the brother of Edzard, John of Osfriesland. While staying in Vadstena on the way, a great scandal erupted when John was discovered in Cecilia's chamber without his trousers. The scandal became famous under the name Vadstenabullret (The Vadstena Thunder). John were imprisoned and Catherine and Edzard placed under guard in V√§ster√•s Castle. Catherine acted as mediator to execute a release of John, that Cecilia be treated leniently and to be given permission to leave. The complications, her own pregnancy and the death of her father in 1560 caused the delay of their departure until 1561. Countess of Ostfriesland Catherine arrived in Ostfriesland in April 1561. As countess of Ostfriesland, Catherine took an active part in policy and the affairs of state. She supported Edzard in his conflict with his brother John over the rule of the divided Ostfriesland, while John had the support of his mother Anna. The conflict also had a religious dimension, as Edzard and Catherine were Lutherans, while John and Anna were Calvinists. She worked to secure a new succession which banned co- ruling, and she actively supported Lutheranism before Calvinism. In 1578, the childless John did agree that the son of Catherine should be his heir, but this did not end the struggle. Catherine fully used her family connections for her policy and asked her ruling brothers to intervene in her benefit, while she herself used her connections in return: she assisted Charles with his export- and import business, she provided ships for the Swedish fleet in the war against Russia, and assisted in the negotiations for marriages for Charles and Elizabeth. She is known to have protested against the marriage of her brother King John III to Gunilla Bielke in 1585. In 1591, Edzard became sole regent, but in 1594, the Emden revolution erupted. Catherine asked for the assistance of her brother Charles IX, who on this occasion advised her to show religious tolerance and expressed his surprise that it was always Catherine who seemed to handle the negotiations of the affairs of state rather than Edzard. Fiefholder After the death of Edzard in 1599, Catherine lived at Berum Castle and took control over her dower lands Norden, Pewsum, Woquard Loquard, Campen and Neeuwarden. These lands were only given to her as her dower lands, but Catherine instead took control over them as an autonomous ruler: the refused to acknowledge her son Enno III and his right to collect taxes and exert authority in her fiefs, and declared herself a vassal directly under the emperor. This caused a conflict with her son which remained unsolved until her death. When the council of Enno III reprimanded him for being to submissive to her and pointed out to him that Catherine abused her rights as a mother to demand obedience, he excused himself by saying: \\"Because she is a woman, because she is a widow, already seventy, because she is the daughter of a king and, which is the greatest reason to show her respect, because she is a mother.\\" Catherine's grave in Aurich Catherine is considered to be closest in character to her father among her siblings.

History Chaka Malik and Chris Traynor began writing songs together in 1992, releasing an EP in 1994 on Revelation Records. The line-up for this recording included Larry Gorman on drums and Eric Rice on bass. Rice left to play bass for H2O, Davide Gentile joined the band, and soon after, Detroit native Matthew Cross took over on drums. With this line-up, they began writing material for their 1995 major label release Driver Not Included on East West Records (a subsidiary of Elektra Records). The album was recorded in Los Angeles with Dave Jerden (Alice in Chains, Jane's Addiction) producing. Additional songs, \\"Magnet,\\" \\"Suspect,\\" and a re-recording of \\"Can't Decide\\" from the Revelation EP were later recorded in New York City. Mainstream success Following the release of \\"Driver Not Included,\\" Orange 9mm toured the US with Helmet, Quicksand, Korn, and Deftones; they were also featured on the first Airwalk Sno-Core Tour. Later, they toured Europe with Biohazard, and were on the bill for three shows with The Offspring. With Warner Music Group (the parent company of Elektra and Atlantic) consolidations, Orange 9mm moved to Atlantic Records. During the writing sessions for what would become their second full-length, Davide Gentile left the band to pursue audio engineering. Orange 9mm's second full-length, \\"Tragic,\\" was recorded in New York City, with Dave Sardy (Barkmarket, Helmet, Marilyn Manson) producing. For these sessions, Chris Traynor played bass. At the end of the initial recording sessions for \\"Tragic,\\" Taylor McLam joined the band on bass (McLam played drums in Traynor's previous band, Fountainhead). On the first day of rehearsals, McLam offered one of his own compositions, which became the minor hit \\"Failure.\\" The song was recorded immediately, and included on \\"Tragic.\\" Two weeks prior to the first tour to promote \\"Tragic,\\" Chris Traynor left Orange 9mm to play second guitar for the seminal New York hardcore/metal band Helmet. The band recruited former Supertouch bassist Chris Vitali to take over on bass, and McLam was moved to guitar. Orange 9mm toured the U.S. in support of \\"Tragic,\\" with artists including The Misfits, Deftones, Sick of it All, Ned's Atomic Dustbin, Local H, and Clutch, among others, including headlining runs and one-offs with The Sisters of Mercy and Type O Negative. Post \\"Tragic\\" Era Orange 9mm was released from its contract with Atlantic following the \\"Tragic\\" tour cycle. For the next three years, Orange 9mm would write and record a great deal of material under a wide range of influences. Periodically, the band would perform one-offs and small weekend runs; during this period they released a split EP in Japan and did a week's worth of shows in that country. Midway through this creative process, Orange 9mm released a five-song EP, \\"Ultraman vs. Godzilla,\\" with NG Records, an independent with distribution through BMG. The fit between the band and the label seemed a good one; Orange 9mm was given a great deal of room to work on material, and new songs and new sessions kept coming. Over 15 new songs were recorded in the summer of 1998 in the basement of Taylor's Long Island home, and for a few months this material was assumed to be the foundation of the next record. The music was raw and experimental, incorporating more progressive rhythms, more percussion, and 70s-era synths and electric pianos. However, the only piece from these sessions to be finalized and released was the song that became \\"Alien,\\" which would appear on their third full-length, 1999's \\"Pretend I'm Human.\\" Soon after, bassist Chris Vitali left the band to pursue other interests. Again a three-piece, Malik, McLam, and Cross continued writing. The band then moved to Los Angeles and worked with producer/programmer Neil Perry to create a more experimental sort of record. They hit the studio in the spring of 1999 and by the summer awaited the release of what became \\"Pretend I'm Human.\\" The album was a stylistic shift from their previous releases, with less emphasis on a hardcore sound with more focus on straight rapping with loops and other electronica ephemera behind it. The guitars even took a back seat and weren't the primary focus. Upon the album's release, the band toured with added members to help beef up the live sound. But sales were low and by the middle of 2000, due to disagreements among members, the band called it quits. Present  In mid 2018 an Instagram account was opened under the name orange9mmnyc. Most of the images are of records, or live show images, but this gives fans hopes that \\"something\\" might be looming with the band.

It was written by Brian Nelson and directed by Rod Hardy.  Plot  The Nautilus has been sinking and damaging ships and is at first thought to be a giant narwhal. Pierre Aronnax and Ned Land and Cabe Attucks fall off the USS Abraham Lincoln and are picked up by the Nautilus. Pierre Aronnax's father Thierry Aronnax is with the US naval party. Nemo is setting up an underwater domed city under the Atlantic south of West Africa. To avoid earthquake risks to it, he is first setting up a network of underwater explosives to release all Earth's geotectonic tensions at once and thus ensure that no more build up for a long while. During this a Chinese- looking pearl diving girl accidentally activates one of these devices and the Nautilus rescues her in time. Nemo has a daughter called Mara. The US Navy finds where Nemo's base is by a concentrated area of sightings of the Nautilus. The USS Abraham Lincoln sails to the place. At the site, damage caused by Ned Land, and torpedoes fired downwards by the Abraham Lincoln, force the Nautilus to surface. The Nautilus's crew come out on deck and are summarily machine-gunned by the Abraham Lincoln's deck-mounted Gatling guns. Mara and some others escape in one of the Nautilus's diving bells. Pierre Aronnax and Ned Land and Cabe Attucks get on board the Abraham Lincoln. A US naval man boards the Nautilus and shoots Nemo and another survivor on sight. Nemo, before dying, activates a switch which makes the Nautilus explode. Pierre Aronnax's account of these events finds its way to Jules Verne, who uses it as a basis for his novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. Cast * Michael Caine as Captain Nemo * Patrick Dempsey as Pierre Arronax * Mia Sara as Mara * Bryan Brown as Ned Land * Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Cabe Attucks * John Bach as Thierry Arronax * Nicholas Hammond as Saxon * Peter McCauley as Admiral McCutcheon * Kerry Armstrong * Cecily Chun * Ken Senga * Damian Monk * Steven Grives * Gerry Day * Jiri Vacek Boe Kaan  Differences from the novel  The Nautilus gets its power by extracting the sun's heat from the sea water: this is impossible technology, and the movie wrongly calls it hydroelectricity.  Reception  DVD Verdict wrote the miniseries \\"comes off as incomplete\\", but praised Michael Caine's performance as Captain Nemo. David Cornelius of DVD Talk called the adaptation \\"dreadfully dull\\", disapproving of director Hardy's and screenwriter Nelson's work.

It is set on the foothills of Shivalik hills. It is part of the tehsil Dera Bassi. It is the gateway to Chandigarh from Delhi. It comprises mainly the following areas near Chandigarh Airport including Dhakoli, Lohgarh, Bhabat, Bishanpura, Kishanpura, Nabha, Gazipur, Baltana, Singhpura, Peer Muchalla and Dyalpura. This town is situated on the junction of national highways Himalayan Expressway, National Highway 5 (India) towards Shimla, Ambala Chandigarh Expressway towards Ambala and National Highway 7 (India) towards Patiala. Assessing cities on the basis of five key parameters ‚Äî real estate, people, physical infrastructure, social infrastructure and business environment ‚Äî a recent study concluded that India‚Äôs hottest emerging city is Chandigarh. India's first planned city got top ranking for the potential of its real estate market, physical infrastructure and business environment. While there is little space left within the city itself, Chandigarh scores because of the rapid development taking place on its outskirts, in areas like Panchkula, Mohali, Zirakpur and Dera Bassi on the Chandigarh-Ambala highway. Good connectivity, low operational costs and high disposable income also contributed to it being declared India‚Äôs hottest emerging city. Zirakpur also has many shopping malls, showrooms, and factory outlets where people can enjoy shopping. Zirakpur is a hub of real estate development in residential and commercial segment. There are approximately 80,000 flats in Zirakpur, and thousands are under construction. Migrating population from Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana is the main consumer of real estate here. Areas in Zirakpur * Dayalpura : The nearest area to the planned urban estate of Aerocity, IT city Mohali and Chandigarh International Airport. Poised to be the posh area of Zirakpur with many big projects in pipeline. The 200 ft wide planned road through Dayalpura would connect Zirakpur directly to Besttech tower chauk in Mohali near Chandigarh border, shortening the distance of whole Zirakpur. There is a large chunk of shaamlat land, where govt is building a big hospital like GMCH32 Chandigarh. A top- class stadium for special sportspersons, a police station, a big municipal park and some other municipal department buildings are also being planned here. A new high end market with ample parking is going to come up on 80 ft wide 'HighPort Road' that would connect 'High Ground Road' to Airport Road and Aerocity. *Chhat : The Chatbir Zoo (Mahinder Singh Zoological park) is famous all around northern India, and see a large number of daily tourists. * Bhabat / Pabhat * Lohgarh * Peer Muchalla * Dhakoli * Baltana * Nabha * Gazipur * Singhpura * Bishanpura * Kishanpura Zirakpur has also been divided into 16 sectors. History Zirakpur got its name from a small village, which is now a part of the present Zirakpur town. For long it remained a bunch of small villages located along the Chandigarh-Ambala highway. Then Chandigarh started to expand and these villages started to seem like a part of Chandigarh. Before the year 2000, the city had a population of less than twenty thousand. Soon a small village Baltana, which is a part of Zirakpur now, started having some population growth being near to Panchkula and Chandigarh. From 2004 onwards the city's population started to increase rapidly, with booming property prices and the arrival of a large number of residential projects in the suburbs. Public transport and Traffic Zirakpur is well connected through air-conditioned and non air-conditioned local buses with Chandigarh, Panchkula and other neighboring areas. The inter-state buses going from Chandigarh to Delhi, Patiala, Rajpura, Bathinda and most of the northern cities of Haryana pass through Zirakpur. Zirakpur is located on the Ambala-Chandigarh highway and the Patiala-Shimla highway. The nearest railway station is Chandigarh, which is around 8 km from Zirakpur. The nearest airport is situated in Chandigarh at around 5 km from Zirakpur. Some of the new roads that would ease traffic burden on existing roads are:  Airport ring road  Planned 200 ft road connecting Patiala road to Mohali Bestech Chauk, passing through Dayalpura  Planned 80 ft road connecting HighGround road to Aerocity Airport road Retail Zirakpur has a number of shopping malls including easyday, metro, D mart, Cosmo Mall, and big bazaar. It also has showrooms of Reebok, Nike, Adidas, etc. Restaurants include Haldirams, Dominos, KFC, McDonalds and dhabas near the highway. The furniture market is on Baltana road near K area. VIP road has good number of retail showrooms. Highport road connecting HighGround road to Aerocity Airport road could become next commercial hub, being nearest to the planned Aerocity and IT city. Wedding industry Shivalik Hills seen from Zirakpur Zirakpur is the 'Wedding capital' of the region. About 80% of the wedding banquets and resorts of the Chandigarh tri- city are located in Zirakpur. Wedding fireworks in the sky are a routine occasion in the town. Civic amenities The NHAI has made one of the longest flyovers of the regions passing through Zirakpur on Chandigarh Delhi highway. On the Zirakpur-Shimla highway, the railway over-bridge completed in 2011 has considerably improved the connectivity with Panchkula. The Airport Road makes a trip to Mohali shorter and efficient, although recently the airport road has caved in at multiple locations due to poor construction quality leading to several fatal accidents.http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/killer- chandigarh-airport-road-continues-to-be-commuters-nightmare/story- hYAt2mT7xLoUcOFs614x3N.html The Municipal authorities Zirakpur have been under sharp criticism from the various resident associations of the area for not maintaining the roads and thereby leading to dangerous situations for the people commuting.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/zirakpur- roads-call-for-repair/articleshow/60771788.cms The process to divide Zirakpur into various sectors like Chandigarh has been initiated, as per latest Municipal Council meeting.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/zirakpur-goes- chandigarh-way-to-get-sector-wise-layout-in-2-months/articleshow/58545671.cms There have been demand to name Zirakpur as \\"South Chandigarh\\", and sectors numbers starting from 201 onwards. This would give unique sector numbers to whole Tricity, with Panchkula sector numbers starting from 301 and Mullanpur sector numbers starting from 401, thus making addresses short and removing confusion arising of same sector numbers in adjoining towns. Health facilities Zirakpur has a number of small and medium-sized hospitals catering to its primary health needs. Though it still lacks the presence of any big govt. college and hospital, relative to its population. It may be constructed in near future, as Zirakpur MC have sufficient shamlat land available like in Dayalpura.

History The foundation period In 1869 Winnipeg was a straggling frontier village in the Red River Settlement. On May 1 of that year, at the request of Archbishop Tach√©, two Grey Nuns opened the first Catholic school in Winnipeg, St. Mary‚Äôs Academy, to serve the English-speaking Catholics on the west side of the Red River across from St. Boniface. The Academy was located in a rented house on Victoria Street near the centre of population between the intersection of Portage and Main and The Forks, the junction of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. The convent chapel also became home to St. Mary‚Äôs Catholic Church until August 1874, when a church was built at the corner of St. Mary Avenue and Hargrave. In the spring of 1873, when the new province of Manitoba assumed responsibility for education, St. Mary‚Äôs began to receive public funding. Because the arrangement with the Grey Nuns was a temporary one, in 1874 Archbishop Tach√© recruited the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, a teaching congregation from Quebec, to work in education in the diocese. On August 22, 1874, four Sisters of the Holy Names arrived from Montr√©al to assume responsibility for St. Mary‚Äôs Academy. When the school opened on August 29, 1874, 19 students came to register: 12 girls and 7 boys. In later weeks the enrollment grew to 126, including 50 boys. The following year, three Christian Brothers came to Winnipeg and began a school for boys on Hargrave Street (the beginnings of St. Mary‚Äôs School). Boys were not seen within the walls of the Academy again until 1915 when, by special request from the archbishop, they were accepted into grades one and two until 1950. The Brick Academy Enrollment at the girls school increased rapidly and the first St. Mary's Academy on Victoria Street was soon filled to capacity. In 1876 a second small house, called The Annex, was erected, but continued overcrowding necessitated a move to larger quarters on Notre Dame East in 1881, to which a wing was added in 1892. The opening of this second Academy coincided with the period in Manitoba‚Äôs history known as The Boom. Despite the fact that the Manitoba School Act of 1890 removed all public support from Catholic schools, forcing them to become private institutions, registration of resident and day students continued to grow at SMA. Once again the facility became inadequate and the Sisters searched for a new location for the third Academy, away from the crowded, noisy, commercial core of the city. A New Academy in Crescentwood A site was purchased in Crescentwood for a new Academy designed by Samuel Hooper. On August 31, 1902, the cornerstone for the Wellington Crescent Academy was blessed. The Edward Cass Construction Company took the better part of a year to complete the building at an estimated cost of $75,000. The new Academy, shaped like a ‚ÄúU‚Äù was an elaborate structure four stories high with solid brick walls and a mansard roof. The top floor was one large dormitory for students. The Manitoba Free Press questioned why the Sisters built so far out on the prairies. On September 6, 1903, the school opened with 27 Sisters, 148 borders and 48 day students. In 1904 land was sold to the city of Winnipeg to extend Stafford Street and to the Winnipeg School Division for Kelvin High School. 1909‚Äì1963 By 1909 another addition was needed. The four storey over stone basement, costing about $80,000, was designed by J.A. Senecal and J.A. Hudon and built by Senecal and Smith. The annex was wider than the original building. This change in width was hidden on the Academy Road side by a large tower housing a staircase. The fourth floor was an extension of the dormitories. The south side of the first floor housed the music department with 25 pianos. A substantial amount of piling work was undertaken during the 1930s to address cracking foundations and other damage. In 1926 St. Mary‚Äôs became affiliated with the University of Manitoba and began functioning as St. Mary‚Äôs Academy and College. At the time, St. Mary‚Äôs was the West‚Äôs only Catholic institution where the full college course was offered to women. A pupil entering kindergarten could continue through college without change of school. During the 1930s the school survived the ever-increasing taxes on the property, accentuated by the depression, and launched a new period of steady growth in the post-war era. Another expansion In June 1960 the boarding school closed, ending a ninety-year-old tradition, and the elementary grades and the College were phased out to help reduce crowding. But, as enrollment continued to climb, a third expansion was necessary. The 1964 addition, a large wing including a theatre, library, fine arts studio and gym, was inspired by a desire to enrich the school culturally. By the end of the decade the Academy was a junior and senior high school for day students. The Last five decades In the last decades of the 20th century other changes were made to keep up with the times and to meet the needs of students. In 1969 the ornate chapel was altered to in accord with the liturgical renewal mandated by Vatican Council II. In May 1971, the Commercial or Secretarial department, which began in 1904, closed and the academic program became oriented more to preparation for post-secondary education. In 1981 the music rooms were eliminated to make way for additional classrooms and home economics labs. While the school grew it became increasingly clear that the role of the Sisters was changing. In December 1979 St. Mary's Academy Inc. was incorporated in the Province of Manitoba and a Board of Directors, whose members included parents, alumnae, friends of the Academy and Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, assumed responsibility for the school. By the 1980s most Sisters had been replaced by lay teachers, many of whom were themselves alumnae. In 1985 the director/principal administration model was adopted and the first director and lay principal were named. As the century drew to a close, in June 1999, the last few Sisters living in residence moved out. The space vacated by the Sisters presented the school with new opportunity. In 2002 the 1909 wing underwent major renovations and upgrades once again. Four new science labs were built on the fourth floor and the old labs in the basement were converted into home economics labs. Two classrooms were added and the entire building was air-conditioned and brought up to current building and fire code standards. Today, St. Mary's Academy remains the oldest, continuously operating, independent school in the province. The school is noted for its commitment to young women and for providing exceptional academic, religious, and extra-curricular programs. Recent expansion The school went through another expansion, opening up a new library, fitness center, new art studio, and with a few other large expansions still to be completed. The new art lab has drafting tables, pottery wheels, a Mac lab, and Wacom tablets. The school is officially opened its new dramatic arts wing complete with props studio, make up/dressing rooms, and costume lab, in September 2013.  People   Notable Alumni  Isabella Mary Gainsford, the granddaughter of John A. Macdonald, attended St. Mary's Academy for about a month in 1887 before being sent to boarding school.

Angiopoietin signaling most directly corresponds with angiogenesis, the process by which new arteries and veins form from preexisting blood vessels. Angiogenesis proceeds through sprouting, endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and vessel destabilization and stabilization. They are responsible for assembling and disassembling the endothelial lining of blood vessels. Angiopoietin cytokines are involved with controlling microvascular permeability, vasodilation, and vasoconstriction by signaling smooth muscle cells surrounding vessels. There are now four identified angiopoietins: ANGPT1, ANGPT2, ANGPTL3, ANGPT4. In addition, there are a number of proteins that are closely related to ('like') angiopoietins (Angiopoietin-related protein 1, , , , , , , ). Angiopoietin-1 is critical for vessel maturation, adhesion, migration, and survival. Angiopoietin-2, on the other hand, promotes cell death and disrupts vascularization. Yet, when it is in conjunction with vascular endothelial growth factors, or VEGF, it can promote neo-vascularization. Structure Angiopoietin protein structure. It consists of the N-terminus super cluster domain, the linker region, the central coiled domain, and the binding site at the C terminus. Structurally, angiopoietins have an N-terminal super clustering domain, a central coiled domain, a linker region, and a C-terminal fibrinogen-related domain responsible for the binding between the ligand and receptor. Angiopoietin-1 encodes a 498 amino acid polypeptide with a molecular weight of 57 kDa whereas angiopoietin-2 encodes a 496 amino acid polypeptide. Only clusters/multimers activate receptors Angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 can form dimers, trimers, and tetramers. Angiopoietin-1 has the ability to form higher order multimers through its super clustering domain. However, not all of the structures can interact with the tyrosine kinase receptor. The receptor can only be activated at the tetramer level or higher. Specific mechanisms  Tie pathway The collective interactions between angiopoietins, receptor tyrosine kinases, vascular endothelial growth factors and their receptors form the two signaling pathways‚Äî Tie-1 and Tie-2. The two receptor pathways are named as a result of their role in mediating cell signals by inducing the phosphorylation of specific tyrosines. This in turn initiates the binding and activation of downstream intracellular enzymes, a process known as cell signaling. Tie-2 Tie-2/Ang-1 signaling activates Œ≤1-integrin and N-cadherin in LSK-Tie2+ cells and promotes hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) interactions with extracellular matrix and its cellular components. Ang-1 promotes quiescence of HSC in vivo. This quiescence or slow cell cycling of HSCs induced by Tie-2/Ang-1 signaling contributes to the maintenance of long- term repopulating ability of HSC and the protection of the HSC compartment from various cellular stresses. Tie-2/Ang-1 signaling plays a critical role in the HSC that is required for the long-term maintenance and survival of HSC in bone marrow. In the endosteum, Tie-2/Ang-1 signaling is predominantly expressed by osteoblastic cells. Although which specific TIE receptors mediate signals downstream of angiogenesis stimulation is highly contested, it is clear that TIE-2 is capable of activation as a result of binding angiopoietins. Angiopoietin proteins 1 through 4 are all ligands for Tie-2 receptors. Tie-1 heterodimerizes with Tie-2 to enhance and modulate signal transduction of Tie-2 for vascular development and maturation. Tyrosine kinase receptors are typically expressed on vascular endothelial cells and specific macrophages for immune responses. Angiopoietin-1 is a growth factor produced by vascular support cells, specialized pericytes in the kidney, and hepatic stellate cells (ITO) cells in the liver. This growth factor is also a glycoprotein and functions as an agonist for the tyrosine receptor found in endothelial cells. Angiopoietin-1 and tyrosine kinase signaling are essential for regulating blood vessel development and the stability of mature vessels. The expression of Angiopoietin-2 in the absence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) leads to endothelial cell death and vascular regression. Increased levels of Ang2 promote tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and inflammation. Effective means to control Ang2 in inflammation and cancer should have clinical value. Angiopoeitin, more specifically Ang-1 and Ang-2, work hand in hand with VEGF to mediate angiogenesis. Ang-2 works as an antagonist of Ang-1 and promotes vessel regression if VEGF is not present. Ang-2 works with VEGF to facilitate cell proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Changes in expression of Ang-1, Ang-2 and VEGF have been reported in the rat brain after cerebral ischemia. Angiogenesis signaling To migrate, the endothelial cells need to loosen the endothelial connections by breaking down the basal lamina and the ECM scaffold of blood vessels. These connections are a key determinant of vascular permeability and relieve peri-endothelial cell contact, which is also a major factor in vessel stability and maturity. After the physical barrier is removed, under the influence of the growth factors VEGF with addition contributions of other factors like angiopoietin-1, integrins, and chemokines play an essential role. VEGF and ang-1 are involved in endothelial tube formation. Vascular permeability signaling Angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 are modulators of endothelial permeability and barrier function. Endothelial cells secrete angiopoietin-2 for autocrine signaling while parenchymal cells of the extravascular tissue secrete angiopoietin-2 onto endothelial cells for paracrine signaling, which then binds to the extracellular matrix and is stored within the endothelial cells. Cancer Angiopoietin-2 has been proposed as a biomarker in different cancer types. Angiopoietin-2 expression levels are proportional to the cancer stage for both small and non-small cell lung cancers. It has been also implicated to play role in hepatocellular and endometrial carcinoma-induced angiogenesis. Experiments using blocking antibodies for angiopoietin-2 have shown to decrease metastasis to lungs and lymph nodes. Clinical relevance Deregulation of angiopoietin and the tyrosine kinase pathway is common in blood-related diseases such as diabetes, malaria, sepsis, and pulmonary hypertension. This is demonstrated by an increased ratio of angiopoietin-2 and angiopoietin-1 in blood serum. To be specific, angiopoietin levels provide an indication for sepsis. Research on angiopoietin-2 has shown that it is involved in the onset of septic shock. The combination of fever and high levels of angiopoietin-2 are correlated with a greater prospect of the development of septic shock. It has also been shown that imbalances between angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 signaling can act independently of each other. One angiopoietin factor can signal at high levels while the other angiopoieting factor remains at baseline level signaling. Angiopoietin-2 is produced and stored in Weibel-Palade bodies in endothelial cells and acts as a TEK tyrosine kinase antagonist. As a result, the promotion of endothelial activation, destabilization, and inflammation are promoted. Its role during angiogenesis depends on the presence of Vegf-a. Serum levels of angiopoietin-2 expression are associated with the growth of multiple myeloma, angiogenesis, and overall survival in oral squamous cell carcinoma. Circulating angiopoietin-2 is a marker for early cardiovascular disease in children on chronic dialysis. Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma-associated herpesvirus induces rapid release of angiopoietin-2 from endothelial cells. Angiopoietin-2 is elevated in patients with angiosarcoma. Research has shown angiopoietin signaling to be relevant in treating cancer as well. During tumor growth, pro- angiogenic molecules and anti-angiogenic molecules are off balance. Equilibrium is disrupted such that the number of pro-angiogenic molecules are increased. Angiopoietins have been known to be recruited as well as VEGFs and platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs). This is relevant for clinical use relative to cancer treatments because the inhibition of angiogenesis can aid in suppressing tumor proliferation.

In the 1940s, he founded three chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Indiana.Yvonne Shinhoster Lamb, \\"Obituary of James Cameron\\", The Washington Post, 12 June 2006, accessed 14 July 2008 He also served as Indiana's State Director of the Office of Civil Liberties from 1942 to 1950. In the 1950s he moved with his family to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he continued as an activist and started speaking on African-American history. In 1988 he founded America's Black Holocaust Museum in the city, devoted to African-American history from slavery to the present. Cameron was a survivor of a lynching attempt, which occurred when he was a 16-year-old suspect in a murder/robbery case in Marion, Indiana; two older teenagers were killed by the mob. Early life and education Cameron was born February 25, 1914, in La Crosse, Wisconsin, to James Herbert Cameron and Vera Carter. After his father left the family, they moved to Birmingham, Alabama, and then to Marion, Indiana. When James was 14, his mother remarried. Arrest and attempted lynching Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith, lynched August 7, 1930, in Marion, Indiana In August 1930, when Cameron was 16 years old, he had gone out with two older teenage African-American friends, Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith. They attempted to rob a young white man, Claude Deeter, and killed him. His girlfriend Mary Ball was with him, and said she had been raped. Cameron said he ran away before the man was killed. The three youths were caught quickly, arrested, and charged the same night with robbery, murder and rape. (The rape charge was later dropped, as Ball retracted it.) A lynch mob broke into the jail where Cameron and his two friends were being held. According to Cameron's account, a lynch mob of 12,000‚Äì15,000 at the Grant County Courthouse Square took all three youths from the jail. The older two were killed first: Shipp was taken out and beaten, and hanged from the bars of his jail window; Smith was dead from beating before the mob hanged both the boys from a tree in the square. Cameron was beaten and a noose was put around his neck; before he was hanged, the voice of an unidentified woman intervened, saying that he was not guilty. Frank Faunce, a local sports hero and football All-American from Indiana University, intervened and removed the noose from Cameron's neck, saying he deserved a fair trial. Faunce escorted the young man to a return to the jail. Cameron's neck was long scarred from the rope. Flossie Bailey, a local NAACP official, and the State Attorney General worked to gain indictments against leaders of the mob in the lynchings but were unsuccessful. No one was ever charged in the murders of Shipp and Smith, nor the assault on Cameron.Monroe H. Little, Review of James Madison's A Lynching in the Heartland, History-net , accessed 11 June 2014 Cameron was convicted at trial in 1931 as an accessory before the fact to the murder of Deeter, and served four years of his sentence in a state prison. After he was paroled, he moved to Detroit, Michigan, where he worked at Stroh Brewery Company and attended Wayne State University.James Cameron Holocaust Museum founder, African American Registry, 2006, accessed 15 July 2008 In 1991, Cameron was pardoned by the state of Indiana. Career Cameron studied at Wayne State University to become a boiler engineer and worked in that field until he was 65. At the same time, he continued to study lynchings, race, and civil rights in America and trying to teach others. Because of his personal experience, Cameron dedicated his life to promoting civil rights, racial unity, and equality. While he worked in a variety of jobs in Indiana during the 1940s, he founded three chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). This was a period when the Ku Klux Klan was still active in the Midwest, although its numbers had decreased since its peak in the 1920s. Cameron established and became the first president of the NAACP Madison County chapter in Anderson, Indiana. He also served as the Indiana State Director of Civil Liberties from 1942 to 1950. In this capacity, Cameron reported to Governor of Indiana Henry Schricker on violations of the \\"equal accommodations\\" laws designed to end segregation. During his eight-year tenure, Cameron investigated more than 25 incidents of civil rights infractions. He faced violence and death threats because of his work. thumb Civil rights activism America's Black Holocaust Museum By the early 1950s, the emotional toll of threats led Cameron to search for a safer home for his wife and five children. Planning to move to Canada, they decided on Milwaukee when he found work there. There Cameron continued his work in civil rights by assisting in protests to end segregated housing in the city. He also participated in both marches on Washington in the 1960s, the first with Martin Luther King, Jr., and the second with King's widow Coretta and Jesse Jackson. Cameron studied history on his own and lectured on the African-American experience. From 1955 to 1989 he published hundreds of articles and booklets detailing civil rights and occurrences of racial injustices, including \\"What is Equality in American Life?\\"; \\"The Lingering Problem of Reconstruction in American Life: Black Suffrage\\"; and \\"The Second Civil Rights Bill\\".\\"Our Founder\\", America's Black Holocaust Museum, accessed 15 July 2008 In 1982 he published his memoir, A Time of Terror: A Survivor's Story. After being inspired by a visit with his wife to the Yad Vashem memorial in Israel, Cameron founded America's Black Holocaust Museum in 1988. He used material from his collections to document the struggles of African Americans in the United States, from slavery through lynchings, and the 20th-century civil rights movement. When he first started collecting materials about slavery, he kept it in his basement. Working with others to build support for the museum, he was aided by philanthropist Daniel Bader. The museum started as a grassroots effort and became one of the largest African-American museums in the country. In 2008, the museum closed because of financial problems. It reopened on Cameron's birthday, February 25, 2012, as a virtual museum.  Personal life  Cameron and his wife, Virginia Hamilton, had five children. He died on June 11, 2006, at the age of 92, from congestive heart failure. He is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Milwaukee.

Teufelsbr√ºcke of St Gotthard Pass, Switzerland. Devil's Bridge is a term applied to dozens of ancient bridges, found primarily in Europe. Most of these bridges are stone or masonry arch bridges and represent a significant technological achievement in ancient architecture. Due to their unusual design, they were an object of fascination and stories in antiquity and medieval Europe. Each of the Devil's bridges typically has a corresponding Devil-related myth or folktale regarding its origin. These stories vary widely depending on the region and beliefs. Some have the Devil as the builder of the bridge, relating to the precariousness or impossibility of such a bridge to last or exist in the first place, so much so that only the Devil himself could have built it. Others have the knowledge to build such bridges given to the mankind as a gift from the Devil as part of a deal, pact or bargain between the Devil and local populace, usually in exchange for their souls. Associated legends Little Devil's Bridge (1809) by J. M. W. Turner The bridges that fall into the Devil's Bridge category are so numerous that the legends about them form a special category in the Aarne-Thompson classification system for folktales (Number 1191). Some legends have elements of related folktale categories, for example Deceiving the Devil (AT #1196), The Devil's Contract (AT #756B), and The Master Builder legends. One version of the tale presents the bridge builder and the Devil as adversaries. This reflects the fact that frequently, such as in the case of the Teufelsbr√ºcke at the St Gotthard Pass, these bridges were built under such challenging conditions that successful completion of the bridge required a heroic effort on the part of the builders and the community, ensuring its legendary status. Other versions of the legend feature an old lady or a simple herder who makes a pact with the Devil. In this version the devil agrees to build the bridge, and in return he will receive the first soul to cross it. After building the bridge (often overnight) the devil is outwitted by his adversary, for example by throwing bread to lure a dog over the bridge first, and is last seen descending into the water, bringing peace to the community. In the case of the Steinerne Br√ºcke in Regensburg, the legend speaks of the devil helping in a race between the builders of the bridge and of the cathedral (in fact a significantly later construction), and a slight bump in the middle of the bridge is said to result from the devil's leaping with rage upon being tricked out of his prize. In the legend of Teufelsbr√ºck in Hamburg, which only leads over a small stream, the carpenter had a pact with the devil, and he promised him the first soul crossing the bridge. On the day of inauguration, while the priest and county councillor debated who should step on the bridge first, a rabbit crossed it and the disappointed devil disappeared. A statue refers to the legend there. The legend of Ponte della Maddalena in Borgo a Mozzano, Province of Lucca, tells of a local saint, often Saint Julian, the Hospitaller, who made the pact with the devil. On the day of delivery, the saint sets fire to a dog or a pig that crosses the bridge and deceives the devil. At Sens, a thirteenth century legend tells of an architect who sold his soul to the devil and then subsequently repented. M. le Cur√© of Sens, drove the devil away with holy water and an exorcism formula beginning with the words Vade retro satana, which he made the penitent repeat.\\"Odd Phrases in Literature\\", The Irish Quarterly Review, Volume 6, Part 1, 1856, note p. 683 The formula was, at some time, incorporated into the design of the popular Saint Benedict Medal. Most of the bridges that have received the Devil's Bridge appellation are remarkable in some regard, most often for the technological hurdles surpassed in building the bridge, but on occasion for its aesthetic grace as well, or for its economic or strategic importance to the community it serves.

The ship was briefly re-purposed as an amusement center in 1987, and converted to a casino in 1990. The boat was dismantled for scrap metal starting in 2011. Origin The SS Admiral descended from the SS Albatross, a ferry for heavy vehicles owned by the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad. With no bridge over the Mississippi River at Vicksburg, Mississippi, the railroads accessed a pair of transfer ships to shuttle railcars across. Albatross was fitted with rails built onto the deck, allowing railcars to roll onto the ship, ride a short distance aboard the ferry, then roll over to tracks on the opposite shore after the river crossing was completed. A bridge completed in 1930 rendered the Albatross obsolete for its intended purpose, retiring it from ferry service after 23 years. Rebuild Streckfus Steamers, a company which ran excursion boats along the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, acquired the metal-hulled sidewheeler, Albatross, in 1935. The company refitted the steamer with a five- story, steel superstructure. Completed in 1940 and measuring 374-feet, Streckfus Steamers rechristened it SS Admiral.Kenney, p. 26. The art deco exterior was designed by Mazie Krebs for Captain Joe Streckfus in 1933. The young Krebs was a fashion illustrator for the St. Louis department store Famous-Barr, and neither she nor Streckfus originally took the design seriously, but she would also design another vessel for Streckfus, SS President, in 1934. Construction was completed in 1940 at a cost of over $700,000 (equivalent to approximately $13M in 2019). Streckfus Steamers tested the rebuilt ship on May 28, 1940. From 1938 to 1940 Steamers Service Company rebuilt for more than $1,000,000 a ship with five decks, two of which were air-conditioned, an unheard-of luxury. Her steel hull was divided into 74 compartments, of which up to 11 could be flooded with the ship still remaining afloat. The new steel framework was designed and fabricated by Banner Iron Works. The two massive piston shafts that drove the side paddle wheels were nicknamed Popeye and Wimpy and were visible from the lower deck. Excursion business Admiral moored in the Mississippi River, just north of the St. Louis Arch The SS Admiral departed on her first excursion cruise from the St. Louis waterfront in June 1940. The steamer could carry as many as 4400 passengers. Among the ship's many amenities included food service, a large ballroom, and a lido deck. When Streckfus Steamers started excursions on the SS Admiral, they ran many all-day excursions, but later on, the market shifted toward shorter trips. Gangplanks led to the first deck, where popcorn was sold, and later, the company added a souvenir stand. The second and third decks were both air-conditioned, and together, these levels were called the \\"Cabin.\\" A large ballroomwith a capacity of about 2000occupied most of the second deck, overlooked by ceiling tiles decorated with signs of the zodiac. Tables and booths were all around the ballroom, and there was a bandstand for live music. The second deck also included a bar and a concession stand. The third deck, also known as the mezzanine level, was surrounded by large windows, and featured several dining and lounge areas. A large powder room on the mezzanine was named and styled for Greta Garbo. Interior furnishings and other decorations were designed in the Art Deco-mode. The frame of the fourth level housed unglazed windows, creating a partly open-air deck. The main kitchen was located there, as well as a large lounge and dining area, with a cafeteria and a soda jerk. The top deck, or \\"lido deck,\\" was the only place on the Admiral available for completely open-air lounging. With unobstructed views, this was a vantage point for the St. Louis Arch, the top-terraced homes on the Chouteau's Bluff, the Eads Bridge, the Martin Luther King Bridge and the Jefferson Barracks Bridge. Several coin-operated telescopes facilitated close-up views. The pilothouse, whistles, lights, and the ship's calliope were also located on the lido deck. In 1973, Streckfus Steamers converted the Admiral from steam to diesel power. The shafts for the paddlewheels were cut and removed to make way for port and starboard diesel propellers. The side- propellers and a stern-mounted propeller were all run by large Caterpillar engines. Stationary entertainment venue In 1979, the United States Coast Guard condemned the hull of the Admiral and prohibited the ship from plying the Mississippi. Streckfus Steamers two years later sold the docked ship to John E. Connelly, a Pittsburgh businessman with plans to move it to his hometown, which were never realized. Facing an estimated $1.5 million in repairs to the aging boat, Streckfus Steamers opted to sell the Admiral to Connelly for $600,000. Connelly sent the Admiral to Kentucky for repairs. Later he returned it to St. Louis and sold it for $1.5 million to a group of local investors, SS Admiral Partners. A subsidiary of Six Flags, Six Flags Admiral Corporation, acquired the Admiral and became the new general partner of SS Admiral Partners. The new ownership group invested $31 million in the latest renovation: $25 million in private funds and $6 million from a federal grant. The fourth and fifth decks were converted to enclosed facilities. The ship was painted silver. A theater was added to the complex, along with a stationary multi-level docking facility. Several restaurants and a sports bar were located in the retired ship. The partnership decided not to undergo the expense of a dry dock inspection, but later replaced structural deficiencies. This, together faulty construction and problems with labor, resulted in final capital costs of $37 million, or $11 million over the original estimate. The Admiral opened as an entertainment center in 1987, featuring several music venues, a restaurant, and the \\"Birdland Theater,\\" a set of fourteen animated, mechanical birds which played music. The venture missed a payment on its electricity bill in November of that year. The group subscribed John E. Connelly (the former owner) as an investor; however, less than a year later, the partnership was losing $100,000 per month and defaulted on $10 million in loan payments. Casino After the early 1990s it was operated from moorings near Eads Bridge as the President Casino Laclede's Landing. It had 1,230 slot machines, 59 gaming tables, 18 restrooms, and one restaurant. Barge collision About 7:50 pm on 4 April 1998, a tow of the M/V Anne Holly, comprising 12 loaded and two empty barges, which was traveling northbound on the Mississippi River through the St. Louis Harbor, struck the Missouri-side pier of the center span of the Eads Bridge. Eight barges broke away from the tow and drifted back through the Missouri span. Three of these barges drifted toward Admiral. The drifting barges struck Admiral, causing 8 of its 10 mooring lines to break. Admiral then rotated clockwise downriver, away from the Missouri riverbank. The captain of Anne Holly disengaged his vessel from the six remaining barges in the tow and placed Anne Hollys bow against Admirals bow to hold it against the bank. About the time Anne Holly began pushing against Admiral, Admirals next-to-last mooring line parted. Anne Holly and the single mooring wire that remained attached to Admirals stern anchor held Admiral near the Missouri bank. No deaths resulted from the accident; 50 people were examined for minor injuries. Of those examined, 16 were sent to local hospitals for further treatment. Damages were estimated at $11 million. With the motorless Admiral wedged against the bank, rescue boats worked for hours shuttling about 2,500 people to safety. 21st-century history Admiral, minus her upper decks, is towed from St. Louis to be dismantled on July 19, 2011 In June 2005, it was reported that Columbia Sussex Corp. wanted to buy the President Casino on Admiral and replace it with a new vessel. In August 2008, Pinnacle Entertainment, the owner, was considering moving the boat north to the area near the Chain of Rocks Bridge.St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 19 August 2008, p. C1 After the state refused to approve the deal, Pinnacle surrendered its gambling license and sold to St. Louis Marine in 2010. The top decks were removed, but further dismantlement was delayed due to the 2011 Mississippi River floods, which made it impossible to transport the vessel downstream under the Eads Bridge. After the river lowered to a passable level, St. Louis Marine moved her remains on July 19, 2011 to Columbia, Illinois, and her lower decks were dismantled. The hull was then towed to Calvert City, Kentucky, where it was hauled out on the bank of the Tennessee River and scrapping was completed.

She is the first woman to hold this position. Life and career Between 1992 and 2000, she was the Chairman of the National Bank of Poland, the central bank of Poland. She resigned to take the position of the Deputy Chairman of European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a position she held between 2001 and 2004. Gronkiewicz-Waltz was elected to the Sejm on 25 September 2005 after receiving 137,280 votes in the 19th Warsaw district, running on the Civic Platform list. In the 2006 municipal elections, Gronkiewicz-Waltz served as Civic Platform's nominee for mayor of Warsaw. On 12 November she gained 34.23%, finishing next to Law and Justice candidate, former Prime Minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz. As neither received 50 percent of the vote, a second round election was held on 26 November, where Gronkiewicz-Waltz received 53.18% of the votes, winning the election. Gronkiewicz-Waltz in 2007 In January 2007, just a few weeks into her term, Gronkiewicz-Waltz was at the center of a controversy that could have cost her the office. A law enacted in 2005 obliged the mayors of Polish municipalities to publicly disclose their own as well as their spouse's financial circumstances. The law requires the successful candidate's disclosure statement to be provided within 30 days after the inauguration, whereas the statement regarding the candidate's spouse is to be submitted within 30 days after the actual election. Gronkiewicz-Waltz submitted her own and her husband's statements on 2 January 2007, exactly 30 days after her inauguration. On 20 January, the newspaper Dziennik reported that Mr Waltz's documents had been two days past the deadline, which in his case had been on 28 December 2006. Based on this, Prime Minister Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski of the governing Law and Justice (PiS) party maintained that Gronkiewicz-Waltz's mandate had expired on 28 December 2006, and announced that the local elections would be repeated. Gronkiewicz-Waltz's party Civic Platform argued that the Prime Minister did not have the authority to make this decision, and that the case would need to be examined in court instead. Polish legal experts maintained that by submitting their statements on the same day, Gronkiewicz-Waltz had observed the spirit, if not the letter of the law. Also, having two different deadlines for the statements could be considered as an unconstitutional legal trap. In the meantime, Civic Platform announced that it would nominate Gronkiewicz-Waltz again, should the elections need to be repeated. On 13 March 2007, Poland's Constitutional Tribunal ruled against the governing Law and Justice party and struck down the controversial law that threatened her and many other public officials with the loss of their positions solely because they did not file paperwork on time. Regarding the Equality Parade for LGBT rights in the capital, Gronkiewicz-Waltz has taken the opposite stand to her predecessor, approving it. Though equality marches have been officially allowed in the past, they had always met with strong resistance during the term of Lech Kaczy≈Ñski as Mayor of Warsaw, particularly from the All-Polish Youth movement. Gronkiewicz-Waltz said the parade would pose no threat to morals and pointed to the BƒÖczkowski v Poland ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that Kaczy≈Ñski had acted illegally and discriminatory in banning the 2005 Equality Parade. In the November 2010 municipal elections, Gronkiewicz-Waltz was re-elected as the mayor (or \\"president\\") of Warsaw, winning 53.67% of the votes outright in the first round, making a second round unnecessary. Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz was along with Monika Olejnik, an influential journalist, a murder target of Brunon K., who was arrested in November 2012 in connection with the preparation of a terrorist attack on Sejm. Gronkiewicz-Waltz is a Fellow of Collegium Invisibile as a Professor of Economics.

Although mostly roofless, the structure of the abbey is relatively well preserved. There is an intact cloister, and many other surviving architectural features make the friary of significant historical value.75th Annual Report of the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland; Clonmacnois, King's County. Dublin: A. Thom & Co, 1906 A far earlier monastery had existed on the site, which burned down in 1278. A Norman castle was built soon after by Thomas de Clare, a military commander.Brian Hodkinson, Was Quin Castle Completed?, North Munster Antiquarian Journal, Vol. 44, 2004, pp.53-8 The foundations of the castle's enormous corner towers can still be seen. Around 1350 the castle, by then a ruin, was rebuilt as a church by the McNamara clan. The abbey was rebuilt using the south curtain-wall of the old castle. It was this structure which the MacNamaras subsequently rebuilt as the present abbey, properly called a friary. In 1541, during the Reformation, King Henry VIII confiscated the friary and it passed into the hands of Conor O'Brian, Earl of Thomond. In about 1590 the MacNamaras regained control of the site and once again set about repairing and restoring it. In about 1640 the building became a college and is alleged to have had 800 students. Oliver Cromwell arrived only 10 years later, brutally murdering the friars and destroying the friary. In 1671 the building was once again restored, but never regained its former status. Eventually in 1760 the friars were expelled, although the last Friar, John Hogan, remained there until his death in 1820, by which time the buildings were ruined by neglect.C. P. Meehan, The Rise & Fall of the Irish Franciscan Monasteries; James Duffy & Sons, Dublin 1877. The abbey is roughly from Ennis. A visitor centre is located near the building and the structure and grounds can be visited free of charge. A caretaker is permanently based at the monument. Floodlighting has recently been installed. The graveyard surrounding the friary is still in use.

Definition Prime farmland \\"has the soil quality, growing season, and moisture supply needed to produce economically sustained high yields of crops when treated and managed according to acceptable farming methods, including water management.\\". In general, prime farmlands have an adequate and dependable water supply from precipitation or irrigation, a favorable temperature and growing season, acceptable acidity or alkalinity, acceptable salt and sodium content, and few or no rocks. They are permeable to water and air. Prime farmlands are not excessively erodible or saturated with water for a long period of time, and they either do not flood frequently or are protected from flooding. Overlapping interests Because many of today's major cities were historically founded in agriculturally rich areas, prime farmland tends to be (by virtue of its location) well suited to ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù houses. Therefore, prime farmland is also prime developable land, and is extremely prone to conversion when in proximity to urban growth areas. This trend is further encouraged by the widespread availability of the private automobile, continuous expansion of roadways, and relatively low-priced gasoline. USDA prime farmland designation helps growth management and resource conservation efforts in urban growth areas to use zoning and conservation easements in order to preserve prime farmland resources, maintain local economic diversity, and establish green belts. Nonprofit organizations like American Farmland Trust specialize in helping communities use these techniques. Other designations used by USDA to complement Prime Farmland are Farmland of statewide importance, Farmland of local importance, and Unique farmland. Unique farmland is land other than prime farmland that is used for the production of specific high value food and fiber crops. It has the special combination of soil quality, location, growing season, and moisture supply needed to produce economically sustained high quality and/or high yields of a specific crop when treated and managed according to acceptable farming methods. Examples of crops are tree nuts, olives, cranberries, citruses and other fruits, and vegetables. Other designations Criteria for defining and delineating these lands are determined by the appropriate state or local agencies in cooperation with USDA. The significant difference is that although the criteria are not appropriate outside the state or local area, that these lands approach the productivity of lands in their area which meet criteria for prime farmland and unique farmland. Demarcation of Prime Farmland  A universal method for the demarcation of Prime Farmland (PF) soils that considers both science and policy is highly necessary, as when PF soils occupy < 60% of an area their preservation is hard.

Factories that employ \\"lights-out manufacturing\\" are fully automated and require no human presence on-site. These factories are considered to be able to run \\"with the lights off.\\" Many factories are capable of lights-out production, but few run exclusively lights-out. Typically, in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining, workers are necessary to set up tombstones that hold parts to be manufactured and remove completed parts. As the technology necessary for total automation becomes increasingly available, many factories are beginning to use lights-out production between shifts (or as a separate shift) to meet increasing production demand or to save money on labor. Going forward this concept of automation will become more popular and can support human beings. An automatic factory is a place where raw materials enter, and finished products leave with little or no human intervention. \\"Toward the automatic factory\\" in \\"Electronic Servicing & Technology\\" magazine 1982 August \\"Toward the Automatic Factory: A Case Study of Men and Machines\\" by Charles Rumford Walker 1977 One of the earliest descriptions of the automatic factory in fiction was the 1955 short story \\"Autofac,\\" by Philip K.

There are only nine human quality assurance workers who oversee the end of the manufacturing process. In the manufacturing of integrated circuits using 300 mm wafers, the entire manufacturing process is completely automated, with workers only making sure that the process runs without problems and repairing any faulty machinery. Motivations for lights-out factories Lights-out manufacturing may increase productivity and lower upkeep costs. Companies incorporating lights-out methodologies into floor plans only need to consider robotic workers, which minimize space and climate- control requirements. Human laborers can be dispatched to a separate location for tasks such as quality assurance. Optimizing manufacturing space for a fully autonomous robotic workforce allows for an increase in productivity. James Cook, an application engineer at St√§ubli, colleague of David Arceneaux and the business development and marketing manager at St√§ubli Robotics, says robots can help lower building costs by requiring smaller work cells. He states that \\"manufacturers can fit a larger number of compact cells in the same space to increase production without adding heating, lighting, or cooling to the cost of the building.\\" Floor space is also important for energy conservation, as a smaller space reduces energy consumption by reducing heating costs. Without human workers, climate-control systems are unnecessary, and smaller layouts require less electricity. Opposite approach Since the mid-2010s, Toyota has been moving in the opposite direction, replacing robots with human workers because the human is considered to be essential for flexibility and process improvement. Robots are incrementally reintroduced where appropriate.

A British foraging party was flanked and driven off by forces composed mostly of New Jersey militia, depriving the British of their wagons and supplies. This action was one of a series of skirmishes known as the Forage War that persisted in northern New Jersey through the first few months of 1777, and it demonstrated that militia companies were capable of putting up a significant fight. Background After George Washington's successful movements around the army of Charles Cornwallis that culminated in the Battle of Princeton on January 3, 1777, Washington faced the dilemma of being caught between Cornwallis in Trenton, New Jersey and the rest of the British Army at New Brunswick, New Jersey. Rather than make an attempt on the British outpost at New Brunswick with his exhausted troops, Washington moved his army up the Millstone River valley toward Morristown, New Jersey, a place he knew could be strongly fortified and used as winter quarters. Cornwallis and the remaining British and Hessian troops in and around Trenton and Princeton withdrew to New Brunswick to regroup after the battle at Princeton. On January 13, a significant portion of the British army advanced from New Brunswick west to Somerset Court House (present-day Millstone, New Jersey), and remained there for about a week before retreating back to New Brunswick, destroying houses and plundering supplies. During this time, militia companies mustered to assist the Continental Army. These movements established the area west of New Brunswick up to the Millstone and Raritan rivers as a no man's land between the two forces. Following the British retreat, Somerset Court House became one of several outposts garrisoned by Patriot militia companies, with support from the Continental Army. Battle A British foraging party of 500 men, led by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Abercromby of the 37th Foot, left New Brunswick on January 20, and headed west toward the Millstone River. They crossed over the river (it is unclear exactly which bridge they used), leaving a rear guard of Hessians with some field artillery to cover the bridge, and eventually reached Van Nest's mill at Weston, New Jersey (near present-day Manville, New Jersey), a few miles north of Somerset Court House, and near the point where the Millstone empties into the Raritan. There they seized supplies of all varieties, and prepared to return to New Brunswick. An 1806 map of central New Jersey Militia companies to the north were alerted to the British movement early in the day, and some marched for Bound Brook, New Jersey. When reports arrived of the activity at Van Nest's mill, they marched for that place. In all about 400 New Jersey militia and 50 Pennsylvania militia formed under Brigadier General Philemon Dickinson to dispute the British action. While detailed accounts of their movements are sketchy, Dickinson apparently divided his forces, sending one force to meet the front of the British wagon train, while a second moved to flank them. Both of these forces forded one of the rivers, wading in icy water that was waist deep. One successfully surprised the British wagon train in the lane near the mill, before it reached the main road and the bridge toward New Brunswick; their fire struck horses from the first wagon. This stopped the train, scattered the wagon drivers and drove the British to retreat precipitously toward the bridge, leaving their booty behind. When the militiamen reached the bridge, the Hessian rear guard fired grape shot from its artillery to cover the retreat. After an exchange of fire across the river without apparent consequence, the British withdrew. Aftermath Lt Col Robert Abercromby Dickinson wrote in a letter to Colonel John Nielson on January 23, \\"I have the pleasure to inform you that on Monday last with about 450 men chiefly our militia I attacked a foraging party near V. Nest Mills consisting of 500 men with 2 field pieces, which we routed after an engagement of 20 minutes and brought off 107 horses, 49 wagons, 115 cattle, 70 sheep, 40 barrels of flour - 106 bags and many other things, 49 prisoners.\\" General Washington, who was not always happy with the performance of the militias, wrote, \\"Genl Dickinsons behaviour reflects the highest honour upon him, for tho' his Troops were all raw, he lead them thro' the River, middle deep, and gave the Enemy so severe a charge, that, altho' supported by three field pieces, they gave way and left their Convoy\\", and only reported the taking of nine prisoners. Archibald Robertson, a British officer who was not part of the expedition, reported that \\"Lieutenant Colonel Abercromby with 500 men went on a foraging party towards Hillsborough. Part of this Corps was attacked by the Rebels, which occasion'd such disorder Amongst the Waggon Drivers that 42 Waggons were left behind.\\" One British witness was \\"absolutely certain the attackers were not militia, they were sure that no militia would fight in that way.\\" Casualty figures were extremely variable, but British casualties (killed, wounded, or captured) appear to have been in the low 30s according to press accounts (contrary to Dickinson's claim of 49 prisoners taken), while militia casualties were relatively small in number. Skirmishing continued between American and British forces throughout the winter in a period that historian David Hackett Fischer dubbed the Forage War, since it revolved around the British need for forage for its horses. The American tactics, primarily driven by New Jersey militia commanders but supported by Washington and the Continentals, were so successful that even British foraging parties of 2,000 men came under attack at the Battle of Quibbletown (present- day New Market, New Jersey) on February 8.

His last command in World War II opposed the advance of the First Canadian Army through the Reichswald in February 1945. Early life and military career Schlemm joined the Prussian Army in 1913. During the inter-war years, Schlemm served in a variety of staff, training and regimental posts until, in October 1937, he was attached to the Reich Air Ministry. In February 1938, he transferred from the Army to the Luftwaffe and was appointed to the Luftwaffe General Staff and in June 1938, he became Chief of Staff of Air Defense Zone West. World War II In October 1939, he became Chief of Staff of Luftgau [Air Zone] XI, under Generalleutnant Ludwig Wolff and in December 1940, Schlemm was appointed Chief of Staff of the XI Air Corps under General der Flieger Kurt Student. The Corps was the headquarters staff of Germany's parachute and air landing forces which, on 20 May 1941, the Germans used for Operation Merkur, the airborne invasion of Crete. At least 6,000 airborne troops were lost and the conquest of Crete effectively ended all plans for large-scale German airborne operations. Eastern Front From February 1942, Schlemm was attached to the General Command of the 8th Air Corps (Generaloberst Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen) on the Eastern Front, where he became Commander of Luftwaffen-Gefechtsverbande (\\"Battle Formation\\") Schlemm assigned to the XXXX Panzer Corps and the LVI Panzer Corps in General der Infanterie Gotthard Heinrici‚Äôs 4th Army. Schlemm became commander of the 1st Air Division in June 1942. In October 1942, he became Commanding General of the II Luftwaffe Field Corps on the Eastern Front. Schlemm's corps comprised four Luftwaffe Field Divisions and held the line from south of Nevel to the Dvina River east of Vitebsk, under the 3rd Panzer Army of Army Group Centre. In February and March 1943, the II Luftwaffe Field Corps participated in Operation Kugelblitz against the Soviet partisan northeast of Vitebsk. On 6 October 1943, part of Schlemm's corps collapsed under a major Soviet attack, resulting in a 10-mile gap in the German lines and the abandonment of Nevel. The entire II Luftwaffe Field Corps fell back to new positions west of Gorodok. Italy Withdrawn from the line in November 1943, Schlemm's four divisions were attached to the LIII and IX Army Corps and were transferred to Italy. On 1 January 1944, Schlemm's headquarters staff, redesignated as 1st Parachute Corps, took control of a reserve force of 24,000 troops in the Rome area. They were initially dispatched from Rome to bolster the Winter Line along the Garigliano River, but soon Schlemm's corps were urgently transferred to oppose the Allied beachhead at Anzio (Operation Shingle). Schlemm led the German troops for three days until command formally passed to Generaloberst Eberhard von Mackensen, Commander-in-Chief of the 14th Army. The Corps fought at Anzio for the next three months. Schlemm was cited in the official Armed Forces Communiqu√© and received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his efforts. After the Winter Line was breached at Cassino and the Anzio bridgehead breakout, Schlemm's Corps joined the German withdrawal through central Italy. By August 1944, they were lodged in the Arno and Gothic Line defensive positions in the northern Apennines. Schlemm relinquished command of the Corps to Generalleutnant Richard Heidrich. Reichswald Schlemm succeeded Generaloberst Kurt Student as Commander-in-Chief of the 1st Parachute Army on the Western Front in the Netherlands. The 1st Parachute Army was engaged defending the Reichswald against the Canadian First Army during Operation Veritable. The Canadian First Army and Lieutenant-General William H Simpson‚Äôs U.S. Ninth Army compressed Schlemm's forces into a small bridgehead on the west bank of the Rhine opposite Wesel. On 10 March 1945, the rearguard of the 1st Parachute Army evacuated their bridgehead, destroying the bridge behind them. He was wounded in an air attack on his command post at Haltern eleven days later and command of his forces passed to General G√ºnther Blumentritt. Alfred Schlemm died on 24 January 1986 at Ahlten near Hannover.

The correct name of the model was Custom Super Eight One-Eighty. The car was derived from the Packard Super Eight One-Sixty with which it shared the complete running gear including the in-line eight- cylinder, engine that developed 160 horsepower. It was advertised as the most powerful eight-cylinder engine offered by any automobile manufacturer in 1940. (By contrast, the Cadillac 346 cubic inch V-8 developed 150 hp). It was complemented and gradually replaced by the more modern looking and expensive Packard Clipper in 1941 and fully replaced by the Custom Eight after the war. Packards of all series (110, 120, 160, 180) shared similar body styling in 1940 (which some later said led to a \\"cheapening\\" of the once-exclusive luxury marque), using the same bodies with hoods and front fenders of different length to meet their respective chassis. Thus the 160 and 180 got identical bodies. However, the 180s featured finer interior detailing with the best fabrics, leather and carpeting available. Packard used a special woolen ceiling in these cars only which was sewn longitudinally. Packard built the partition in its Limousines in a way that there was no hint of it when the partition glass was lowered, allowing the owner to use the car by himself as a sedan (thus the designation \\"Sedan Limousine\\" by Packard). 1940 Packard One- Eighty Formal Sedan (Series 1807) In 1940, Packard made air conditioning an option. It was developed by the Henney Motor Company, with whom Packard had a long standing business connection. Air conditioning had been used on Henney- bodied ambulances as early as 1938. It was the first time that air conditioning was available on a stock automobile. The Packard 180 was also the first car to have power windows. In an exclusive agreement with Packard since 1937 until Henney's demise in 1954, Henney provided bodies for Packards's ambulances, hearses and flower cars, and they often provided special custom body work for passenger cars. The pre-World War II Henney models usually had 160-180 trim but were actually constructed on the Packard 120A 156\\" wheelbase chassis with the smaller 288 cubic inch engine although there were also 160 and 180 versions available. 1942 Packard Custom Super Eight One-Eighty 8-passenger sedan (Series 2008) There were minor styling changes in the 1941 and 1942 models (19th and 20th series), the most notable of which were the moving of the headlamps into the fenders. Also for the first time, running boards could be deleted with a rocker panel put in their place to cover the chassis, and two-tone paint schemes were available. New for 1941 was the \\"Electromatic Drive\\", a vacuum-operated clutch for the manual transmission. Packard's own automatic transmission, the Ultramatic, would not be ready until 1949. The final 180s rolled off the Packard assembly line in February 1942, as production restrictions of World War II brought a halt to civilian automobile production. There have been rumors that machinery was transferred to the Soviet Union, and production continued until 1959 as the ZIS-110. James Ward found no supporting evidence in the Packard archives of such a transfer.James Ward, The Fall of Packard, p. 46. Also, the ZIS-110 shares no sheet metal with any Packard, despite the fact that its external decor elements were intentionally designed to heavily resemble pre-war Packards, favoured by Stalin after he had received a Packard Twelve as a gift from Franklin D. Roosevelt. A black 1941 Packard One-Eighty Super Eight was featured in The Godfather.  Darrin-bodied cars  1940 Packard One Eighty Convertible Victoria by Darrin Designer Howard \\"Dutch\\" Darrin had made a few special bodies on Packard-basis, beginning in 1937. He tried to sell Packard on the idea of Darrin-bodied cars being offered directly by Packard, and finally got his way after parking one if his creations outside the Packard dealers' annual conference. For the 1940 model year, three Darrin bodystyles were available: the closed four-door Sport Sedan, the four-door Convertible Sedan, and the two-door Convertible Victoria. About 100 Packard Darrins were built until 1942, when production of private cars ended because of the war. This was much fewer than planned. Building even this number of cars would have overstretched Darrin's Hollywood workshops so they were built by American Central Manufacturing - one of the last remnants of the Auburn-Cord-Duesenberg conglomerate - in Connersville (\\"Little Detroit\\") Indiana instead. Darrin would travel back and forth between California and Indiana supervising construction. This work was shifted to Sayers & Scovill in Cincinnati (the company became Hess & Eisenhardt in 1942) to let ACM concentrate on building Jeep bodies. Between 59 and 72 Packard Darrins were built in 1940, of which 44 (or 48) were One-Eightys and the remainder One-Twentys. For the 1941 and 1942 model years the four-door Darrins were discontinued, leaving only the Convertible Victoria. References *Ward, James A.

In naval matters, vessels \\"in ordinary\\" (from the 17th century) are those out of service for repair or maintenance, a meaning coming over time to cover a reserve fleet or \\"mothballed\\" ships. History of use The term arose from the development of three separate financial estimates for Royal Navy expenditure; the \\"Ordinary\\" estimate which covered routine expenses such as the maintenance of dockyards and naval establishments, the \\"Sea Service\\" estimate which supported ships and crew at or capable of going to sea, and the estimate for \\"Extraordinary Repair\\" which met the cost of major rebuilding or refit. A ship that was no longer required for active service, or was too decrepit to remain at sea, would be transferred from the Sea Service to the Ordinary estimate, and would be left \\"in Ordinary\\" until returned to duty or broken up.Baugh 1965, pp. 455-457 Ships could remain \\"in Ordinary\\" for lengthy periods, including for example which spent 38 years \\"in Ordinary\\" between its launch in 1719 and first active service in 1757.Baugh 1965, p. 241 Poorly maintained, they were susceptible to dry rot and were routinely crewed by pensioned or disabled sailors with little interest in a return to sea service. During the War of the Austrian Succession from 1739 to 1745, a review of ships \\"in Ordinary\\" revealed that at least half of their warrant officers were too old or sickly to serve outside their mothballed vessels.Baugh 1965, pp. 244-245 Improvements were made from 1752 when Admiral George Anson, the newly appointed First Lord of the Admiralty, initiated reforms of royal dockyards with the intention of maximising the number of vessels capable of being put to sea at any time. However, most of Anson's reforms were opposed by the Navy Board, which had direct responsibility for dockyard management and felt that Admiralty's interference was a rebuke to its authority.Middleton 1988, pp. 109-110 Admiralty conducted a further review of vessels in ordinary, in 1755. The review identified Plymouth Dockyard as the worst performer in ship maintenance and repair, with some ships untouched since 1745.Middleton 1988, p. 111 Plymouth Dockyard's master attendant and clerk of the survey were dismissed, a new dock and slipway constructed and dock workers and ship's crews were required to work longer hours to ensure the ships held in ordinary were capable of being sailed. To maximise resources, construction of new vessels was also transferred to private shipyards.Middleton 1988, pp. 111-112 Lastly, Admiralty successfully petitioned the Privy Council to remove the Royal Navy's Surveyor, Joseph Allin, who had held the post for forty years and was now \\"disordered in his senses.\\"Correspondence, Admiralty to the Lords Justices, 12 August 1755. Cited in Middleton 1988, p. 111 These various efforts were successful in improving the quality of vessels held in ordinary, such that more than 200 ships were in commission or capable of being sailed by the end of 1755 compared with 97 in 1753.Middleton 1988, p. 112 Royal Navy officers ashore on half-pay were also considered \\"in Ordinary\\" and paid from the same estimate that applied to sidelined vessels.Baugh 1965, p. 103 Royal Household In relation particularly to the staff of the British Royal Household, and more generally to those employed by the Crown, it is used as a suffix showing that the appointment is to the regular staff, for example a priest or chaplain-in-ordinary, or a physician-in-ordinary, being a cleric or doctor in regular attendance.

Versions were available for most if not all computers sold under the TRS-80 name, including the Color Computer and several pocket computer designs, as well as the Tandy version of the Xenix operating system. Some of these versions are tape-based and have no ability to read or write to disk. Functionality Scripsit is a rudimentary word processor. It has basic text entry and margin controls, as well as word wrap. Many versions tied to specific platforms were available, and each version had its own set of features. Most versions supported variable width fonts, specifically for daisy-wheel printers. None had support for graphics other than some character macros depending on the version. The version for the TRS-80 Model I had special handling to make it possible to use lowercase letters, even though the hardware itself did not support mixed-case type. Despite its limitations, it was seen at the time as a killer application for the TRS-80 line of machines, along with other breakthrough applications such as VisiCalc. The software market evolved quickly, however, and its popularity soon gave way to WordPerfect running on the IBM PC. Word processors typically require the use of special function keys to access editing commands as opposed to text entry. This proved to be a challenge on the TRS-80 Model I and Model III computers, as their keyboards had no non-typewriter modifier keys‚Äînot even a [Control] key. Instead, Tandy drafted the '@' key to access features such as margin control and load/save. Superscripsit Scripsit's main menu An alternate disk-only version named Superscripsit was available with spellchecking for some platforms, specifically the Model I, Model III, and Model 4.Word Processing And Data Management, Page 52, 14 Dec 1981, New York Magazine, ...Super SCRIPSIT word- processing program ($199, Model III), which rivals the features of $10,000 office word-processing machines. Radio Shack's SCRIPSIT Dictionary ($149) contains the spellings of over 60,000 commonly used words... This version basically matches the functionally of the normal Scripsit for disk-based platforms such as the Model II, Model 12, and Model 16.\\"Radio Shack release multiuser software\\", Page 11, April 9, 1984, InfoWorld, \\"...released two multiuser software packages for its powerful Model 16 microcomputer system....and Scripsit word-processing programs...The Model 16 can accommodate up to six users...\\" Some additional features such as boilerplating and integration with Profile, Tandy's database program for all of their TRS-80 platforms, are available for the disk versions. Starting Superscripsit led to a main menu of tasks such as \\"Open\\", \\"Proofread\\", or \\"Setup\\". Presumably because of the limited screen area on most TRS-80 models, there were no visible menus on the editing screen. RAM was probably also an issue, since selecting each of the options resulted in heavy floppy disk activity. Superscripsit for the Models III and 4 could handle text files larger than memory by paging text data in and out of RAM to disk (effectively a virtual memory technique, but implemented by an applications program). Sometimes (often, according to some frustrated users) this feature malfunctioned and created a garbled data file. Rescue utilities were made available to rectify this situation. Scripsit Pro This was an all-new version written for Tandy/Radio Shack by CompuSoft. The author was Samuel A. Solomon. Scripsit Pro required a TRS-80 Model 4 equipped with the full 128 KB RAM. The text buffer was limited to 32 KB and it lacked Superscripsit's ability to page text from disk. However, it could hold a second 32K text document in banked RAM and split the screen to permit editing of both documents at once, and to transfer text between the two buffers. It could also chain text files, handle footnotes and columnar text, and included a spell checker with a customizable dictionary. The documentation included instructions for the creation of custom printer drivers. Bugs Scripsit had a number of significant bugs that could result in the loss of work. The Model 4 version, for example, would inject random text throughout the document if the user held the control key ('@') down for more than a few seconds. If the machine turned off or were reset while a document was still open, the software could not open the document ever again. Early versions had the counter-intuitive step of \\"closing the file\\" which required a special operation before saving and exiting the file. If this step was omitted, the file could not be opened again. No warnings were issued beforehand. This was eliminated in newer versions of Scripsit. Printing support One handy and somewhat innovative feature for the time was the ability to add custom control characters in the printer setup. This allowed the user to take advantage of new features in a printer that were not intrinsically supported by Scripsit, such as different fonts or colours, or printing extended ASCII characters to produce simple lines and boxes. This was possible as printer manuals of the day included a full list of supported control character sequences for such functionality. Notable users Isaac Asimov used Scripsit running on a TRS-80 Model II Computer for over nine years, and wrote over 11 million words with the program. British thriller author James Follett also used Scriptsit, running on a TRS-80 Model I, to write The Tiptoe Boys, which was filmed as Who Dares Wins.The Bird Sanctuary: James Follett James Fallows praised Scripsit as \\"the word-processing program I prefer above all others ... the best program on the market\\".

Its history is largely known from the Proclamation of Anitta, CTH 1. Zalpuwa was by a \\"Sea of Zalpa\\". It was the setting for an ancient legend about the Queen of Kanesh, which was either composed in or translated into the Hurrian language: > [The Queen] of Kanesh once bore thirty sons in a single year. She said: > \\"What a horde is this which I have born[e]!\\" She caulked(?) baskets with > dung, put her sons in them, and launched them in the river. The river > carried them down to the sea at the land of Zalpuwa. Then the gods took them > up out of the sea and reared them. When some years had passed, the queen > again gave birth, this time to thirty daughters. This time she herself > reared them. The river at Kanesh (Sarƒ±msaklƒ± √áayƒ±) drains into the Black Sea, not (for example) Lake Tuz. \\"Zalpuwa\\" is further mentioned alongside Nerik in Arnuwanda I's prayer. Nerik was a Hattic language speaking city which had fallen to the Kaskians by Arnuwanda's time. This portion of the prayer also mentioned Kammama, which was Kaskian as of the reign of Arnuwanda II. The best conclusion is that Zalpuwa was in a region of Hattian cities of northern central Anatolia: as were Nerik, Hattusa, and probably Sapinuwa. Zalpuwa was most likely, like its neighbours, founded by Hattians. Around the 17th century BC, Uhna the king of Zalpuwa invaded Ne≈°a, after which the Zalpuwans carried off the city's \\"Sius\\" idol. Under Huzziya's reign, the king of Ne≈°a, Anitta, invaded Zalpuwa. Anitta took Huzziya captive, and recovered the Sius idol for Ne≈°a. Soon after that, Zalpuwa seems to have become culturally and linguistically Hittite. Arnuwanda's prayer implies that Zalpuwa was laid waste by Kaskians, at the same time that Nerik fell to them, in the early 14th century BC. ƒ∞kiztepe on the Kƒ±zƒ±lƒ±rmak Delta near the Black Sea coast is suggested as a possible location for Zalpuwa.Bajramovic, Gojko Historical Geography of Anatolia in the Old Assyrian Colony Period p.120, Museum Tusculanum Press, 2011 References *The Proclamation of Anitta, CTH 1 * Category:Former populated places in Turkey Category:Lost ancient cities and towns ","title":"Zalpuwa"},{"id":"5814649","text":"Jean-Claude Flabel is the author of the aerospace engineering textbook Practical Stress Analysis for Design Engineers; a handbook on practical stress analysis which is widely used within the aerospace industry.

Personal life Fisher was born in San Francisco, California, on April 27, 1861. He received his first lesson in music from John P. Morgan, a leading Western musician. Intended for a business career, he was led to devote himself entirely to music, and with that end in view he left California in 1890 and went to New York City. There he studied under Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k and Horatio Parker at the National Conservatory of Music of America. He was instructor in harmony at the Conservatory of Music for several years, resigning in 1895 to take up teaching in Boston. He was president of both the Music Teachers National Association and the Music Publishers' National Association. He also worked for the music publisher Oliver Ditson Company which was later taken over by the Theodore Presser Company. He died in Brookline, Massachusetts on December 18, 1948.Wilson Library Bulletin, Volume 23, p. 410, 1948 Career In an 1893 interview, Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k challenged white American composers to make better use of the \\"negro melodies of America\\", feeling that they were needed as the basis for \\"any serious and original school of composition\\" in America. Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k's New World Symphony was played at Carnegie Hall on December 16, 1893. Later William Arms Fisher wrote a text to the cor anglais tune in the second movement, entitled \\"Goin' Home\\", which has been mistaken for a Negro spiritual. In response to the challenge and the symphony, William Arms Fisher published an arrangement of Seventy Negro Spirituals in 1926. William Arms Fisher wrote an article for Music Educators' Journal in 1933 titled \\"Music in a Changing World.\\" Patrick Freer of Music Educators' Journal said that \\"Fisher‚Äôs article was one of the first to interrogate the role of popular music within music education\\". In his article, Fisher said that music is important in every community. A quote from his article is \\"Blessed are the music-makers, for they shall uplift and unite the Earth.\\" which was mentioned by the MENC: The National Association for Music Education. Recognition An article in The Crisis published in February 1927 called William Arms Fisher \\"a worthy pupil and disciple of Dvo≈ô√°k\\" and asked if he \\"would waste his time over futile music\\". The article quoted an anonymous reviewer saying, \\"If we must have Negro spirituals, by all means let us have Fisher to arrange them.\\" Media Fisher's compositions have been featured in several albums.

It is the sixth volume of the book of Nezikin. Shevu'ot deals primarily with the laws of oaths in halakha (Jewish law). Mishnah The Mishnah to Shevu'ot contains eight chapters: # In connection with the statement that oaths may be divided into two classes, which are again subdivided into four, other actions and conditions are enumerated which are similarly divided; e.g., the perception of defilement, carrying from a private domain to the public domain on the Sabbath and vice versa, and the appearance of the different kinds of leprosy (¬ß 1); further details concerning the method of recognizing uncleanness; manner of effecting atonement, by various private or communal sacrifices, for offenses committed consciously or unconsciously in a state of uncleanness, or for other trespasses against the Law (¬ß ¬ß 2-7). #Further details relating to the perception of uncleanness; the statement that a person who enters the Temple in a condition of uncleanness must offer a sacrifice, is supplemented by one to the effect that all the apartments subsequently added to the Temple must be regarded in this respect as the Temple proper; in connection therewith the ceremonial accompanying the enlargement of the Temple and of the city is described. #On the four kinds of oaths, and the difference, of opinion between R. Ishmael and R. Akiba in regard to this subject (¬ß¬ß 1-5); if a person swears to fulfil or to disregard a religious duty, he is not bound to offer a sacrifice in the case of not fulfilling his vow (¬ß 6); concerning a thoughtless vow (\\"shebu'at bi·π≠·π≠uy\\") and a vain oath (\\"shebu'at shaw\\"), e.g., when a person affirms an absurd statement by an oath, as that a stone is gold, or that he saw a camel fly through the air (¬ß¬ß 7-8); violation of an oath (¬ß 9); the punishment for the intentional violation of a thoughtless oath, and the sacrifice which must be offered in the case of an unintentional violation (¬ß 10); the punishment for transgressing a vain oath (¬ß 11). #Concerning the oath of the witness; if a person asks two witnesses to testify in his favor before the court, and they deny under oath that they can give testimony for him, then they are guilty of violating the witness' oath (comp. Lev. v. 1); cases and persons to whom the witness' oath applies; and forms under which the oath is administered to witnesses by the plaintiff, in order that they may be found guilty of breaking such oath in refusing to testify. #On the oath relating to a deposit (\\"shevu'at ha-pikadon\\"; compare Leviticus 5:21 et seq.), i.e., the oath taken in cases where objects have been wrongfully or forcibly acquired or retained; the persons taking it; and the cases in which it is taken. #Concerning the oath administered by the judge; in civil cases the judge administers it to the defendant only if he partly confesses his guilt; regulations regarding this oath, the minimum of the claim, and the minimum of the defendant's admission; in order that from the nature of a claim the defendant may be required to take the oath the plaintiff must be an adult of normal mind; the claim must be definitely formulated, and may have reference only to money, goods, or other movable objects; no oath may be enforced in connection with a claim to real estate, slaves, or bills of exchange, nor with a claim on the part of the Sanctuary. #The cases in which the plaintiff takes the oath, and wins his case on the strength of it, e.g., in the case of a hireling or storekeeper; other cases in which the defendant may be suspected of swearing falsely; enumeration of the cases in which the defendant may be compelled to take the oath even in reference to indefinite claims; thus every trustee in charge of property may be compelled to take an oath to the effect that he has managed it faithfully and honestly; on an oath occasioned by another oath (\\"gilgul shebu'ah\\"). #The four kinds of wardens (compare Exodus 22:6-14): the unsalaried, the salaried, borrowers, and tenants. Tosefta The Tosefta to this treatise is divided into six chapters, and contains some interesting moral maxims, besides additions to the Mishnah. R. Eleazar b. Mattai says that it is unpleasant for a person to behold a man commit crimes; but that a benefit is conferred upon a person if he is fortunate enough to behold a person perform noble deeds (3:4). A person who commits an act of unfaithfulness toward his fellow man has thereby committed an act of unfaithfulness toward God. Every crime is a denial of God; for the criminal who is about to commit the crime denies that God has forbidden all unjust and immoral deeds (3:6). Talmud Both the Gemaras discuss and explain the contents of the Mishnah. The Babylonian Gemara contains in addition some interesting teachings and comments, among them: * Psalm 91 is designated as \\"shir shel pega'im\\" or \\"nega'im\\" (= \\"the psalm of the plagues\\"; 15b). * An interesting enumeration is given of the names, of God occurring in the Bible which really do not designate God, and of other names which must be referred to God, although they apparently do not apply to Him. Thus \\"Adonai\\" in the story of Lot (Genesis 19:18) designates God, although it might seem that Lot was addressing the angels by this name (35b). In the story of Micah (Judges 17-18) all the divine names that occur must be referred to God, though according to R. Eliezer only a few of them must be so referred. In the Song of Solomon the name \\"Solomon\\" designates God, except in one passage, 8:12 et seq. Noteworthy is R. Joshua's comment on Judges 20 to the effect that the oracle spoke truly all three times, but that the people did not ask the first and second times whether they would be victorious against Benjamin, and that this was not promised to them (ib.).

The transition process only affected large, far-reaching commercial stations and not small, independent ones like WXOB.Are You Ready? Richmond Times-Dispatch, WXOB switched to digital in the 2010s. History Founded on August 30, 1990, the station was launched as W14BN, presumably an independent television station. In 1998, the call signs were changed to WBOX, the station serving as a repeater affiliate for The Box music channel, which was later replaced by MTV2 in 2000. Originally broadcast on local channel 14, the station switched to channel 17 in 2002, after it was acquired by KM Broadcasting and ended its affiliation with MTV2. Once KM's takeover was complete, the call signs were reversed from WBOX to WXOB. The station began to offer religious shows from around the Richmond area, as well as several surrounding cities. In 2004, the station carried the Trinity Broadcasting Network for a short time. Programming WXOB broadcasts religious shows originating from Richmond, as well as cities in the nearby Tidewater Region such as Virginia Beach and Newport News. The television evangelists featured are exclusively Protestant, with some them preaching the controversial Word of Faith theology. The vast majority of ministers seen on the channel are African-American. The station also offers three national religious programs: Enjoying Everyday Life with white female evangelist Joyce Meyer, Amazing Facts with Seventh-day Adventist Church evangelist Doug Batchelor, and the Shepherd's Chapel with controversial pastor Arnold Murray. In the early weekday mornings, the station airs a children's show called ImagineLand.

With the advent of social media and new digital filmmaking tools, the conventions and styles of skate videos continue to evolve and redefine themselves alongside the sport of skateboarding. History Released in 1965, the short film Skaterdater is credited as the first film to depict skateboarding and therefore the first skate video. In 2015, The Berrics campaigned for the film's acceptance into the National Film Registry. Content In most skate videos, skaters show their skills in sections called video parts, but other formats and techniques, such as montages, are used, and new tricks are often demonstrated. Producers Skate videos are usually made by skateboard companies, but small skate shops, magazines, websites and independent skaters may also make skate videos. 411 Video Magazine was a popular bi-monthly video log published in the 1990s and 2000s. Film director Spike Jonze has shot several skate videos. Lens style and music Often the videos are shot using a fisheye lens.

Dubbed the \\"minister of luxury\\" by South Africa's Mail & Guardian, Nyanda was alleged to have spent hundreds of thousands of rands living in a luxurious Cape Town hotel throughout his tenure because he was unhappy with the ministerial house allocated to him. At the same time as the allegations surrounding his living arrangements came to light, Nyanda's private business was under scrutiny. A company, in which Nyanada's family owned 45%, called GNS Risk Management Services (subsequently renamed Abalozi Security Risk Advisory Services) was accused of impropriety in a tender process in March 2010. Amongst its numerous clients were several parastatals, including Transnet Freight Rail, passenger train company Metrorail, state bus company Autopax, and the Gauteng provincial government. It later emerged that Transnet Freight Rail had been involved in the awarding of tenders without following the correct procedures. Amongst the tenders that were questioned was one security contract valued at ZAR 55 million, awarded to GNS Risk Management Services. Transnet's CEO, Siyabonga Gama, was dismissed when the allegations came to light. However, Nyanda was not reprimanded. In October 2010, Nyanda came under fire for the suspension of communications director general Mamodupi Mohlala. It was reported that in July 2010, on the day that Nyanda axed Mohlala, she had reported tender irregularities worth ZAR 70 million to the police for a fraud investigation and had reportedly called for disciplinary action against several senior civil servants. Nyanda fervently denied the allegations, labeling them \\"false, spurious and malicious\\". However, shortly after the story regarding the removal of Mohlala came out, Nyanda was removed from his position as Minister of Communications. Despite the numerous suggestions of political impropriety, Nyanda was subsequently appointed as a parliamentary counselor to ex-President Jacob Zuma.

She served in three wars and made a number of notable captures before she was broken up in 1815. American Revolutionary War In February 1782, Arethusa captured the French ship Tartare, of fourteen 6-pounder guns. Tartare was the former British privateer Tartar, which the French ships Aimable and Diligente had captured in September 1780. The Royal Navy took Tartare into service as .Demerliac (1996), p.90, #601. On 20 August 1782, Arethusa recaptured the former British warship . She was armed with 18 guns and carrying a crew of 71 men. She was also carrying a cargo of of indigo and eight hogsheads of tobacco. French Revolutionary Wars Arethusa was assigned to the British Western Frigate Squadron under Commodore John Borlase Warren. The squadron consisted of Flora, Captain Sir John Warren, Arethusa, Captain Sir Edward Pellew (later Lord Exmouth), , Captain Thomas Wells, Concorde, Sir Richard Strachan, and Nymphe, Captain George Murray. These were all 36-gun ships, apart from Nymphe and Arethusa with 38. The Western Frigate Squadron engaged a French squadron off the √éle de Batz on 23 April 1794. The squadron had sighted four strange sail which, upon closure, were identified as three French frigates and a corvette. The French squadron included the new French frigate which, at 44 guns, was the most powerful ship in action that day. Flora and Arethusa were the first to close with Pomone and , the corvette of 20 guns. The opening shots were fired just before 6 a.m. For about forty- five minutes, the four ships manoeuvred against one another without any severe damage being done. Then Flora lost her mainmast and was forced to drop astern. With Flora out of action, Pellew ordered Arethusa to close with the corvette. Arethusas carronades quickly destroyed her resistance. Leaving Babet to be finished by Melampus, Arethusa then engaged Pomone, coming to within pistol range at 8.30 a.m. and raking her repeatedly. Within twenty-five minutes one of the finest new French frigates was a ruin, her main and mizzen masts shot away and a fire burning on her aft deck. Just after 9 a.m., Pomone struck her colors. Melampus and Arethusa captured Babet. The action had cost Babet some 30 to 40 of her crew killed and wounded. Arethusa also captured Pomone which had between eighty and a hundred dead or wounded out of her 350-man complement. Arethusa had three men killed and five wounded, a tribute to her superior gunnery. The captured vessels were brought her into Portsmouth, arriving on 30 April.Winfield (2008), p.214. The Royal Navy took Babet and Pomone into service under their existing names. Additionally Concorde captured Engageante in this action. Engageante suffered 30 to 40 men killed and wounded. Concorde lost one man killed and 12 wounded. Heavy mast damage to both vessels delayed their return to Portsmouth. Engageante was taken into British service as a hospital ship. Some four months later, on 23 August, Arethusa and Flora sent their boats into Audierne Bay. There they attacked two French corvettes, Alerte and Espion, driving them ashore. The British took 52 prisoners.Fonds Marine, p.84.Powell (1930), p.9. On 21 October, the British frigate captured at the Action of 21 October 1794. Artois shared the prize money with the other frigates in her squadron, Arethusa, , and . On 31 January 1795 Arethusa was part of a squadron under Captain Sir John Borlase Warren that captured the Dutch East India ship Ostenhuyson. Later that year Arethusa, under the command of Captain Mark Robinson, was one of the Royal Navy vessels under Borlase Warren's command that participated in the unsuccessful Quiberon Expedition. Arethusa was part of a fleet under the command of Rear Admiral Sir Henry Harvey, commander-in-chief for the Navy in the Leeward Islands, aboard , that in February 1797 captured the Spanish-held Caribbean island of Trinidad. The flotilla sailed from Carriacou on 15 February and arrived off Port of Spain the next day. At Port of Spain they found a Spanish squadron consisting of four ships of the line and a frigate, all under the command of Rear-Admiral Don Sebastian Ruiz de Apodaca. Harvey sent and some of the other smaller ships to protect the transports and anchored his own ships of the line opposite the Spanish squadron. At 2am on 17 February the British discovered that four of the five Spanish vessels were on fire; they were able to capture the 74-gun San Domaso but the others were destroyed.The five Spanish ships were San Vincente (Captain Don Geronimo Mendoza; 84 guns), Gallardo (Captain Don Gabriel Sororido; 74 guns), Arrogante (Captain Don Raphael Benasa; 74 guns), San Damaso (Don Tores Jordan; 74 guns), and Santa Cecilia (Captain Don Manuel Urtesabel; 36 guns). Later that morning General Sir Ralph Abercrombie landed the troops. Captain Wolley of Arethusa superintended the landing.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 24, pp.181-2. The Governor of Trinidad, Jos√© Maria Chac√≥n, surrendered the next day. The flotilla shared in the allocation of ¬£40,000 for the proceeds of the ships taken at Trinidad and of the property found on the island. On 17 April, Arethusa, along with 60 other warships and transports, appeared off the Spanish colonial port city of San Juan, Puerto Rico. The fleet landed a 7,000-man invasion force of Royal Marines, German mercenaries, and black militia troops from the island of Tobago, commanded by General Sir Ralph Abercromby (also spelled \\"Abercrombie\\"). However, the resolute Spanish defense forced the British to withdraw after two weeks. Arethusa (here on the far right at Spithead) witnessed the destruction of by an accidental fire, 1 May 1795 At daybreak on 10 August, Arethusa, commanded by Captain Thomas Wolley, was in the Atlantic Ocean at when she sighted three ships to windward. At 7:30 a.m. one of the ships bore down to within half gunshot, and opened fire. She proved to be the French 514-ton corvette Gaiet√©, commanded by Enseigne de vaisseau Jean-Fran√ßois Guignier. Having taken on a ship almost twice her size, mounting forty-four 18-pounder guns, there could only be one outcome, and the French ship was captured within half an hour, having sustained considerable damage to her sails and rigging, and lost two seamen killed and eight wounded. Arethusa lost one seaman killed, and the captain's clerk and two seamen wounded.James (1837), Vol. 2, pp.87‚Äì88. The Royal Navy took Gaiet√© into service as . On 22 August 1798 a force of 1,100 French soldiers landed in County Mayo to support a major rebellion in Ireland and the militias across the whole of the south of England were mobilized. On 30 August Arethusa arrived at Portsmouth from the coast of France and immediately sailed for Southampton River to embark the Dorset and Devon Militias Times Newspaper 1 September 1798 In May 1799 Arethusa came upon seven enemy vessels which made to engage her, but then turned away when she sailed towards them in \\"a spirited style\\". Arethusa captured one, an armed ship, which was carrying sundries from Saint-Domingue. took the prize into Plymouth on the 23rd while Arethusa sailed off in search of the other six.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 1, p.79. Napoleonic Wars On 12 December 1805, Arethusa, and left Cork, escorting a convoy of 23 merchant vessels. Four days later the convoy encountered a French squadron consisting of five ships of the line and four sailing frigates, as well as nine other vessels that were too far away for assessment. A letter writer to the Naval Chronicle, describing the encounter, surmised that the distant vessels were the Africa squadron that had been escorted by and that they had captured. On this occasion, the British warships and six merchant vessels went one way and the rest went another way. The French chased the warships and the six for a day, ignored the 17, and eventually gave up their pursuit. Boadicea then shadowed the French while Wasp went back to French and Spanish coasts to alert the British warships there. Arethusa and her six charges encountered the French squadron again the next day, but after a desultory pursuit the French sailed off.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 15, pp.300-1. During the Action of 23 August 1806, Arethusa and captured the Spanish frigate Pomona,Giving her the unusual distinction of capturing both a French and a Spanish frigate named after the Roman goddess of plenty. as well as destroying a shore battery and defeating a fleet of gunboats. The captured frigate was taken into the Royal Navy as . The capture of Cura√ßao in 1807, depicted by Thomas Whitcombe On 1 January 1807 Arethusa, , , , and captured Cura√ßao. The Dutch resisted and Arethusa lost two men killed and five wounded; in all, the British lost three killed and 14 wounded. On the ships alone, the Dutch lost six men killed, including Commandant Cornelius J. Evertz, who commanded the Dutch naval force in Cura√ßao and seven wounded, of whom one died later. With the colony, the British captured the frigate Kenau Hasselar, the sloop Suriname (a former Royal Naval sloop), and two naval schooners. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issue of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Curacoa 1 Jany. 1807\\" to any surviving claimants from the action; 65 medals were issued. On 29 November 1808, Arethusa was some north west of Alderney when she sighted and gave chase to a lugger making for the coast of France. After four hours Arethusa captured her quarry, which turned out to be the privateer , of Calais, but eight days out of Cherbourg without having made any captures. She was armed with 16 guns and had a crew of 58 men under the command of Jacques Antoine de Boulogne. Boulogne had some 15 years experience of successful cruising against British trade, all without ever having been captured. Captain Robert Mends, in his letter, was fulsome in his praise of G√©n√©ral Ernouf, recommending that the Royal Navy acquire her. On 4 April 1809, , , and Arethusa encountered the newly built French frigate Ni√©men. Amethyst and Emerald gave chase, with Emerald falling behind. Amethyst caught up the next day. Amethyst and Ni√©men engaged each other in a bitter battle. Arethusa arrived on the scene that evening, firing a couple of broadsides at the badly damaged French ship. Either at this point, or the next morning, Ni√©men surrendered. The Royal Navy took her into service as . Between 26 and 27 February, Arethusa and captured four vessels off the coast of Spain: the 1-gun Mouche No. 4, Etienneite, Charsier, master, Nancy, Subibelle, master, and a chasse-maree of unknown name. Arethusa shared in the proceeds of the capture of Mouche No. 4, which was under the command of M. Sorrel. A boat under the command of Lieutenant Joseph William Bazalgette of Resistance, captured Mouche on 26 February 1809 in an action that resulted in the death of the lieutenant de vaiseau commanding her.O'Byrne (1849), p.59. In May 1811 Arethusa sailed to Cape Verde as escort to a convoy East Indiamen bound for the India and China. Captain Cofffin's orders were to separate from the convoy at Cape Verde, sail to Goree, and then cruise the coast of West Africa as far as the Island of Saint Thomas and back to Cape Verde, then returning to Spithead. While cruising the coast Arethusa was to examine bays and creeks looking for vessels engaged in the slave trade.Grindal (2016), Location 3367. In late June Arethusa grounded on a sunken rock off Factory Island in the Isles de Los. Her launch reached Freetown, Sierra Leone on 1 July, and and sailed to her assistance, joined a few days later by .Grindal (2016), Location 3397. On 7 July Arethusa, making six feet of water per hour, set sail for Freetown, together with Tigress Myrtle, and Protector, and Arethusas two prizes, the American schooner Hawke and Harriet.

The store was one of the oldest in the country being founded on February 22, 1849, but was often overlooked as it maintained only a regional presence. The chain ceased operations in 1994 after being merged with the Lazarus division of Federated Department Stores. Founders Joseph Horne (1826‚Äì1892) was born in Bedford County, Pennsylvania, the son of John Horn and Catherine Otto, grandson of Henry Horn, who had served in the Continental Army. Joseph moved three counties west to Pittsburgh and found his first job in the retail trade with Christian Yeager, the father of South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club member H. C. Yeager. Soon, Joseph moved to the F.H. Eaton store, and became a partner. He bought the business in 1849, at age 23, renaming it The Joseph Horne Company. He joined forces with Christian B. Shea and A. P. Burchfield, whose families intermarried and entered the business, and brought an elegance to this emporium that has never been equaled in Pittsburgh. In 1881, the firm built its new building designed by Charles Tattersall Ingham at Wood and Liberty. In 1891, at age 65, Horne sold the wholesale side of his company's operations to the Pittsburgh Dry Goods Company. He married twice ‚Äî first to Mary Elizabeth Shea, later to Emma Galway ‚Äî and sired numerous children. His son Durbin Horne, born in 1854, was among Horne's children who followed their father into the family business. Both Joseph and Durbin Horne were members of the area's elite South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club. Joseph Horne died in 1892. Christian Bernard Shea (1835‚Äì1900) was the brother-in-law of Joseph Horne, and his founding partner in The Joseph Horne Company. Shea was involved with both halves of the family business ‚Äî retail (Joseph Horne Co. Department Store) and wholesale (Pittsburgh Dry Goods Company). Shea was also member of South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, which suffered devastation during 1889's Johnstown Flood.  History  Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Soon after Horne bought the Eaton Co., the Joseph Horne Company became a leading Pittsburgh department store. In 1879, he constructed a new central location at Penn Avenue and Stanwix Street in Downtown Pittsburgh, a seven-story landmark which was the first department store in the city's downtown. The building still stands to this day and several Horne's signs remains on the building as they do at the former Pittsburgh rival Kaufmann's on Smithfield Street. In 1972, Associated Dry Goods (ADG) acquired Horne's, and ADG expanded operations of Horne's to several stores in suburban malls throughout the Pittsburgh region as well as in Erie, Pennsylvania and Northeast Ohio. In December 1986, Horne's was acquired by a local investor group following ADG's acquisition by May Department Stores. The local buyout was part of May's divesting of the Horne's chain, since May was already the owner of cross-town rival Kaufmann's. Two years later, the Arkansas-based department store chain Dillard's and Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. agreed to acquire Horne's, with plans of combining it with another recent acquisition for Dillard's ‚Äî the Ohio-based Higbee's store chain. The deal was canceled abruptly, resulting in several years of litigation. Dillard's eventually agreed to acquire five Ohio Horne's stores as part of a legal settlement in 1992. By 1994, Federated Department Stores acquired the remaining ten Horne's stores and merged them with its Lazarus division, completely ceasing all operations of any store under the Horne's name. This caused some anger among Pittsburgh shoppers, as Horne's was the oldest store in the city and had been a 145-year-old Pittsburgh tradition. After its closure the company was often praised for surviving 145 years with only a maximum of 15 stores. Several former Horne's locations operating as Lazarus closed in 1998. Those that remained eventually became \\"Lazarus-Macy's\\" and in 2006 were joined with Kaufmann's in the nationwide Macy's consolidation. Flagship store The flagship Horne's Department Store in Pittsburgh was the city's first department store, and remained its only one until the founding of Kaufmann's in 1871. The L-shaped structure is actually three buildings built over the course of time. The first, is six-stories facing Penn Avenue and constructed in 1892. A six-story expansion was added to the west in 1897, followed by a seven-story addition in 1922. The store had four entrances ‚Äî two on Stanwix Street, and two on Penn Avenue and contained of selling space, making it the city's second largest department store. The store bore the Horne's name until 1994 when it became Lazarus. Lazarus only remained in the building for one year before building a new location on Fifth Avenue. Oxford Development Co purchased the building with hopes of ground level retail while renting floors two through seven to Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. Old Navy opened on the first two floors in 1996, but closed in 2003. Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield then purchased the structure and occupies the office space to this day with retail space at ground level. The Horne's Tree The lighting of the Horne's Christmas tree at the flagship store was a long-held holiday season tradition. The six-story electric tree occupied a place on the corner of the building at Penn Avenue and Stanwix Street and viewers would crowd the area for a show and the lighting. The tree is still displayed annually in the tradition of Pittsburgh's Light Up Night at the Horne's building. Crowds also eagerly awaited the Christmas window displays at Horne's, once part of the high competition among Pittsburgh's downtown stores for the attention of the Light Up Night visitors. Left over Horne's Several years after the closing of the last Horne's stores, several signs remain at the historic downtown flagship store building, each bearing the Horne's name. On the southwest corner of the building, two bronze plaques remain reading \\"Joseph Horne Co Dry Goods Importers and Retailers\\". Also, the frieze above the two entrances in the first structure reads \\"1849 ‚Äì Joseph Horne Co. ‚Äì 1879\\" marking the founding of the company and the year of construction, while the frieze of the 1922 addition bears that date. The sidewalk slabs adjoining the entrances have inlays of the Horne's logo. Horne's and popular culture Well beyond Pittsburgh, Horne's became a part of popular culture. Artist Andy Warhol worked at a Horne's location in the store's display department as a summer job in 1947. The television series Twin Peaks referenced a fictional Horne's store and owner, Ben Joseph Horne, which were inspired by the real Horne's. Series co-creator Mark Frost attended Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Horne's also appeared in movies, including the Monroeville Mall location, which was shown in George A. Romero's 1978 movie Dawn of the Dead. The Pittsburgh flagship store was the site of the 1987 erotic thriller, Lady Beware, which starred Diane Lane as a window designer employed there. This was Horne's most notable appearance, as in addition to the location, the store's name appeared. Diane Lane's character worked at Horne's proudly.

The Arizona Supreme Court licenses lawyers, while the State Bar administers the regulation of the practice of law. The State Bar, under the direction of the Court, establishes procedures for the discipline of lawyer misconduct and provides education and development programs for the legal profession and the public. Through the Rules of The Supreme Court of Arizona, the privilege to practice law in Arizona is granted solely to \\"active member[s] of the state bar.\\" It is governed by a 30-member Board of Governors: four non-attorney, public members appointed by the Board; three at- large members appointed by the Arizona Supreme Court, 19 attorney members elected by fellow Bar members in their districts; and four ex officio members (immediate past president and the deans of Arizona's three law schools.) The Bar is a private/non-profit funded through membership dues and service fees; it is not a state agency and receives no taxpayer funding. The State Bar was organized to advance the administration of justice, provide for the regulation and discipline of persons engaged in the practice of law; foster integrity, learning, competence, and public service within the legal profession. Its active membership includes nearly 18,500 lawyers, both in-state and out-of- state. Total membership (including categories for inactive, judicial, retired and others) is nearly 24,000. Consumers look to the State Bar as a resource of information about the legal system, including how to find and hire a lawyer, alternatives to trial, and how to handle a dispute with a lawyer. All of these topics can be found on the Bar's website at www.azbar.org or through free brochures (published by the Bar) available at local libraries and at the State Bar offices in Phoenix and Tucson. Lawyers on Call is a public service program sponsored by the State Bar of Arizona and Phoenix's 12 News KPNX TV. Members of the public can have their legal questions answered by volunteer lawyers. The Bar also partners with Univision to provide a similar service for the Spanish-speaking community. The State Bar promotes the work of its sister organization, the Arizona Foundation for Legal Services & Education, also known as the Arizona Bar Foundation. The Foundation supports pro bono volunteer work by Arizona lawyers, including the \\"Wills for Heroes\\" program, which provides free wills to first responders. Other programs of the Foundation include Kids Voting, Project Citizen, AZLawHelp.org, We the People, LawforVeterans.org, LawforSeniors.org, and LawforKids.org. Lawyer Regulation In addition to providing member services, the State Bar acts in the capacity of a consumer protection agency. The \\"Find a Lawyer\\" tool on www.azbar.org includes the name of anyone ever admitted to the State Bar, along with their current status and a record of their discipline history, if any. There are detailed explanations of disciplinary sanctions on the website, along with a complete description of the disciplinary system. In 2010 the lawyer regulation process was reviewed by The State Bar of Arizona, the Arizona Supreme Court and respondents' counsel representatives. A streamlined system, launched in January, 2011, has resulted in marked improvements in resolution at the Intake stage. The vast majority of charges against lawyers, which might include such things as failing to return calls promptly, can be quickly resolved with a call or letter to the lawyer. These minor charges do not require full investigation. Instead, the resources of the State Bar can be devoted to more serious charges which can take months to investigate. To protect lawyers from frivolous complaints, the Rules of The Supreme Court of Arizona allow the Bar to: : # dismiss minor complaints (about lawyers) without formal proceedings; and # expunge public record of dismissed complaints after six months. Serious ethical violations may result in a variety of sanctions or diversion, with disbarment being the most severe form of sanction. The State Bar publishes these sanctions on its website and notifies media outlets in the sanctioned lawyer's jurisdiction. The entire lawyer regulation process is monitored by the Attorney Regulation Advisory Committee of the Arizona Supreme Court. Its Annual Report is posted at http://www.azbar.org/lawyerconcerns/disciplineprocess/reportsoflawyerdiscipline. The State Bar of Arizona has its critics. Some argue that its dual role as both regulatory agency and professional association don't mix. You can read more at http://lawmrh.wordpress.com/tag/state-bar-annual-dues/. Professional Development The State Bar of Arizona provides a variety of professional development opportunities for its members, ranging from the Bar Leadership Institute, Arizona College of Trial Advocacy, 28 practice area sections, Law Office Management Assistance, Mentor Program, and Young Lawyers Division. History The first Arizona-wide bar association was created in 1895. In 1902, it led the rewriting of a civil code for the Territory and in 1904 strongly promoted the admission of Arizona as a state into the Union. In 1906 the Arizona Bar Association was first incorporated. In 1912 it adopted the ethical rules of the American Bar Association and began official admission procedures for law practice. James M. Murphy, the 24th president of the State Bar of Arizona, recounted the founding of the Bar in a 1960 article for the Arizona Law Review:James M. Murphy, The Arizona Bar: From Individualism to Integration, 2 ARIZ. L. REV. 38 (1960 \\"On the Glorious Feast of St. Patrick in the year 1933,James M. Murphy, Laws, Courts, & Lawyers, The University of Arizona Press, Tucson, Arizona, 1970 the State Bar of Arizona was created as an integrated legal entity. By act of the Legislature the State Bar became a semi-public body, and membership in it was required for anyone who might practice law in Arizona.\\" The first organizational meeting of the State Bar was held in the Supreme Court Room in Phoenix on September 15, 1933. At that time there were about 600 lawyers in Arizona, exclusive of judges. In 1948 the Bar established its first central office in Phoenix. The first Executive Director was hired in 1954. In 1955 the Board authorized the creation of sections in the State Bar organization for the benefit of members with a special interest in particular areas of the law. In April 1961, the Bar published the first Bar Journal, an anthology of featured articles from 1940 to date. This publication has since evolved into Arizona Attorney magazine, which is published 11 times annually and has been nationally recognized as the premier large-bar publication in the country.http://www.nabenet.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&subarticlenbr;=57 In 1988 the Bar opened a satellite office in Tucson, serving lawyers in Pima, Santa Cruz and Cochise Counties. Mandatory Continuing Legal Education requirements were adopted in 1991. The 21st century ushered in a number of changes at the State Bar, including an electronic newsletter, eLegal, sent bimonthly to all members. The Bar purchased and moved into new headquarters in Phoenix and purchased a building for the Southern Regional Office in Tucson. In 2012, the Bar's total membership rose to more than 22,000, which includes out-of-state members.

It was preceded by French Renaissance architecture and Mannerism and was followed in the second half of the 18th century by French Neoclassical architecture. The style was originally inspired by the Italian Baroque architecture style, but, particularly under Louis XIV, it gave greater emphasis to regularity, the colossal order of facades, and the use of colonnades and cupolas, to symbolize the power and grandeur of the King. Notable examples of the style include the Grand Trianon of the Palace of Versailles, and the dome of Les Invalides in Paris. In the final years of Louis XIV and the reign of Louis XV, the colossal orders gradually disappeared, the style became lighter and saw the introduction of wrought iron decoration in rocaille designs. The period also saw the introduction of monumental urban squares in Paris and other cities, notably Place Vend√¥me and the Place de la Concorde. The style profoundly influenced 18th-century secular architecture throughout Europe; the Palace of Versailles and the French formal garden were copied by other courts all over Europe.Hopkins, Owen, Les Styles en Architecture (2014), pp. 84-87 Early French Baroque The French Baroque, from the beginning, was an expression of the power and majesty of the Kings of France. It proceeded deliberately in a different direction from Italy and the rest of Europe, combining classical elements, especially colossal orders of columns, and avoiding the exuberant decoration that appeared on facades and interiors in Spain, Germany and Central Europe. It was used less frequently on churches and more often in the design of royal palaces and country residences. Another distinctive element of the French Baroque style was the integration of the architecture of the house with the formal gardens around it, in what became known as the French formal garden. Salomon de Brosse (1571‚Äì1626) was one of the first French architects to adopt the style, in the construction of the Palais du Luxembourg he built for the mother of Louis XIII, Marie de Medici between 1615 and 1624. The Luxembourg Palace established a new pattern for royal residences, with pavilions on the corners, lateral wings, and a grand central entrance surmounted by a cupola. The walls feature colossal orders of columns with triangular pediments, indicating the classical inspiration behind the French movement. A traditional French feature was the high sloping mansard roof and the complex roofline. Like the palaces of the Medicis in Rome, the palace was surrounded by a large garden and fountains. The interior design was also innovative; the pavilions around the main block contained the apartments, allowing a greater flexibility and functionality of the interior space. One of the most accomplished formulators of the new style was Fran√ßois Mansart, a tireless perfectionist often credited with introducing the full Baroque to France. He was not the first to use the sloping mansard roof, but he used it so effectively that it took his name. In his design for the Ch√¢teau de Maisons in Maisons-Laffitte, (1630‚Äì51), Mansart showed the continuity between the French Renaissance style and the new style. The structure is strictly symmetrical, with an order applied to each story, mostly in pilaster form. The frontispiece, crowned with a separate aggrandized roof, is infused with remarkable plasticity and the whole ensemble reads like a three-dimensional whole. Mansart's structures are stripped of overblown decorative effects, so typical of contemporary Rome. Italian Baroque influence is muted and relegated to the field of decorative ornamentation. Louis Le Vau was another central figure in the early French Baroque style. He designed the Ch√¢teau of Vaux-le- Vicomte (1656‚Äì1661) for Nicolas Fouquet, the Superintendent of Finances of the young Louis XIV, The design of the chateau itself was similar to that of the Luxembourg Palace and the Palazzo Barberini in Rome. What made it distinctive from earlier styles was the unity of its architecture, interior, and landscape around it. Its facade featured stylized monumental columns, wings combined with mansard roofs and a prominent dome, in the Baroque style. The interior was lavishly decorated with murals by Charles Le Brun and it was placed in the center of enormous formal gardens designed by Andr√© Le Notre, laid out in geometric patterns paths, flower beds, fountains and reflecting pools, which seemed to extend the architecture of the house in every direction. The grand salon of the building opened out onto the garden, a feature which thereafter became a regular feature of Baroque palaces. After seeing the lavishness of the building, the King dismissed and imprisoned Fouquet, took possession of the house for the crown, and soon put Le Vau to work to create his own palace in Versailles. The same three artists scaled this concept to monumental proportions in the royal hunting lodge and later main Palace of Versailles (1661‚Äì1690). On a far grander scale, the palace is a hypertrophied and somewhat repetitive version of Vaux-le-Vicomte. It was both the most grandiose and the most imitated residential building of the 17th century. Mannheim, Nordkirchen and Drottningholm were among many foreign residences for which Versailles provided a model.

This design would have aligned the architecture of Paris to the Italian Baroque style. However, in the end Louis turned instead to French designers. He wanted a design that would be distinctly French, rather than a copy of the Italian style. In April 1667, he gave the commission to a committee, the Petit Conseil, consisting of Louis Le Vau, Charles Le Brun, and Claude Perrault, and the three men designed the new fa√ßade together.Berger 1993, pp. 20‚Äì27. It featured the giant order, that is, a long row of double columns two stories high, resting on top of a massive lower levelSummerson 1963, figure 47. with tall, segmental-arched windows, modeled on those used for the Renaissance- style Lescot Wing.Berger 1993, pp. 51‚Äì52. It had a flat roof concealed by a balustrade, with a triangular pediment in the center over the main entry. In 1668 a decision was made to double the width of the south wing, resulting in the construction a new facade on the south, facing the Seine. Perrault also designed a new facade on the interior of the court facing west, and a matching new facade on the north.Renault and Laz√© (2006), p. 55; Berger 1993, pp. .

It was begun in 1624 by Louis XIII as a hunting lodge. In 1634, Louis XIII had it enlarged into a chateau by his chief architect and engineer, Philibert Le Roy. In 1661, Louis XIV decided to enlarge it further, without destroying the original. He commissioned Louis Le Vau and Charles le Brun as his architect and designer, and assigned Andr√© Le N√¥tre to create a grand formal garden that could be viewed from the Chateau, on the model of Vaux-le- Vicomte. When Le Vau died in 1670, the project was given to his assistant Fran√ßois d'Orbay, who completed the initial phase in 1674. The new palace surrounded the old brick chateau, with new wings the north, south and to the rear. The facade, like the new Louvre wing, featured colossal order columns, while the roof was flat with a terrance, decorated with balustrades, pilasters, balconies, statues, and trophies. Beginning in 1674‚Äì75, Le Brun created the interior. A small army of painters, sculptors, and decorators went to work, using marble, polychrome stone, bronze. mirrors and gilded stucco. Le Brun himself painted the ceiling. The Hall of Mirrors, constructed in 1678‚Äì1680 by Jules Hardouin-Mansart, the nephew of Francois Mansart, overlooked the new garden. It was also decorated by Le Brun, who completed it in 1684, after which it became the symbol of the entire French Baroque style. The new Palace was open to almost any visitor, and became an immense theatre, where the King carried out his ceremonies, with meticulous protocol, in public view.

In 1687, Jules Hardouin-Mansart and then Robert de Cotte erected the Grand Trianon, on the model of an Italian building, the Marble Trianon. It had a single floor, decorated with plaster and marble, with a flat roof and balustrade. The plan was very simple, with a peristyle flanked by two wings and two avant-corps, or sections in advance of the wings. It had a simplicity and purity of form that inspired similar palace buildings across Europe, from Prussia to Russia. Mansart also completed the Versailles Orangerie (1684‚Äì1686) in a similar style, surrounding a formal garden and pool. The gardens created by Andre Le Notre were designed to complement the architecture of the palace and to express, by it geometric alleys, pools, rows of the trees, flower beds and fountains, the mastery of the King over nature. The final piece of the Palace was the Chapel, begun in 1689 to the designs of Hardouin-Mansart and completed by Robert de Cotte in 1708‚Äì1710. The room was given more space and light by the use of classical columns instead of massive pillars, and by placing the supporting columns on an upper level. Louis XV continued to add to the Palace, mostly with changes to the interior rooms. His major contribution was the Petit Trianon by Ange-Jacques Gabriel. Its austere architecture was a sign of the transition from French Baroque to Neoclassicism.

However, between 1690 and 1755 twenty-four new church facades were built in Paris. Competitions for new church designs, particularly the Prix de Rome and the competition for the enlarging of Saint-Sulpice and Saint- Eustache in Paris, brought forward many original ideas.Texier (2012) page 52 The first French church facade in the new Baroque style was for the church of St-Gervais-et-St-Protais (1616) by Salomon de Brosse. It featured, like Church of the Jesu in Rome, a facade with the three orders of columns, Doric, Ionic and Corinthian, arranged in stages one above the other. Another variant of the new style appeared in the main Jesuit church in Paris, the Church of Saint- Paul-Saint-Louis, inspired by the Jesuit Church of the Ges√π in Rome. Designed by the Jesuit architects Etienne Martellange and Fran√ßois Derand, had two levels, with the lower level at the height of the chapels, and an upper level, with a second order of columns, and a fronton over the portal of the church. The upper level was supported by consoles in an reversed S form. The surface of the facade was decorated with statues in niches, and with renouncements. The interior plan was rectangual, with a large vaulted nave, flanked with chapels.Texier (2012) pages 30-35 The interiors of new parish churches, such as Saint-Sulpice, Saint-Louis-en-l'√éle and Saint-Roch largely followed the traditional gothic floor-plan of Notre-Dame, though they did add fa√ßades and certain other decorative features from the Italian Baroque. Saint-Roch (1653‚Äì90), designed by Jacques Lemercier, had a Gothic plan but colorful Italian-style decoration. To follow the advice of the Council of Trent to integrate themselves into the city's architecture, new churches were aligned with the street. rather than always facing east-west.

The dome of the Church of the Ges√π in Rome, by Giacomo della Porta (1568‚Äì1584) served as the prototype. The first Parisian church to have a dome was the chapel of the whose facade is now found in the courtyard of the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts on rue Bonaparte in Paris. The next, larger dome was constructed at the √âglise Saint-Joseph-des-Carmes (1613‚Äì20) in the same neighborhood. A larger and still more impressive early dome was built by Fran√ßois Mansart for the Church the Visitation Saint-Marie (1632‚Äì34). Another innovative dome was built by Jacques Lemercier for the College of Sorbonne, beginning in 1635. This design featured a hemispherical dome on a tall octagonal drum, the first of its type in France, with four small cupolas in the angles of the Greek cross above the Corinthian order columns on the fa√ßade. A much larger and higher dome on the Italian Baroque model was begun by Fran√ßois Mansart, then Jacques Lemercier and completed by Pierre Le Muet for the chapel of the royal hospital and abbey of Val-de-Grace (1645‚Äì1665). The facade has two levels of columns and pediments and a peristyle of detached columns, and the dome is decorated with an abundance of vaults, ribs, statues, contreforts, and ornaments, making it the most Italianate of French domes. The second part of the 17th century saw the beginning of two more important domes. The Chapel of the College des Quatre-Nations, (now the Institut de France by Louis Le Vau and Fran√ßois d'Orbay (1662‚Äì1668) was built with a bequest from Cardinal Mazarin across the Seine from Louvre, and contains his tomb. The most grand of the domes was that of Les Invalides, the chapel for the hospital of military veterans, built by Jules Hardouin-Mansart (1677‚Äì1706), both as a symbol of charity and of military glory. The dome is placed on a church in the form of a trek cross. The cube of the building is surmounted by a cylindrical column of two drums, giving the dome exceptional height. The dome itself is richly decorated with sculpture on the entablements as well as ornaments of gilded bronze between the vertical ribs of the dome.

They were defined by Nicolas Catherinot in the Trait√© de l'architecture (1688) as \\"less beautiful than palaces and more beautiful than simple residences.\\" The early h√¥tels particuliers in Paris were influenced partly by Italian architecture and the model of the Luxembourg Palace, on a smaller scale. The early Baroque h√¥tel particulier was usually placed between a walled courtyard in the front and a garden in the back, with the entrance to the courtyard through a pavilion on the street. The H√¥tel de Sully (1624‚Äì1630) in Paris, designed by Jean Androuet du Cerceau, is a good example of the early style, as is the H√¥tel Carnavalet. While the H√¥tel de Sully was originally planned to be built of brick and stone, it was finally built entirely of stone. The h√¥tels grew in size and complexity through the 17th century, with the appearance of the vestibule between 1635 and 1640. The newer houses also began to have two courtyards, one for ceremony (the cour d'honneur) and the other for more practical purposes, such as the stables. The fa√ßade of the residential building facing the garden came to occupy the entire width of the piece of land. New specialized kinds of rooms, such as dining rooms and salons, began to appear. Notable examples of the French Baroque h√¥tels particuliers include the H√¥tel Carnavalet, the H√¥tel de Sully, the H√¥tel de Beauvais (1655‚Äì1660), and the H√¥tel de Soubise (1624‚Äì1639) (now occupied by the French National Archives). A notable example outside of Paris is the Palais Rohan, Strasbourg.

The buildings had high mansard roofs, and tricolor facades of broke, stone, and slate. In the beginning, a statue of Louis XIII on horseback was placed in the center. A smaller square, Place Dauphine, originally with thirty-two houses, was built on the √éle de la Cit√© next to the Pont Neuf between 1607 and 1610. It faced an equestrian statue of Henry IV of France. The next major urban square constructed in Paris was the Place des Victoires (1684‚Äì1697), a real estate development of seven large buildings in three segments around an oval square, with an equestrian statue of Louis XIV planned for the centerpiece. This was built by an enterprising entrepreneur and nobleman of the court, Jean-Baptiste Pr√©dot, combined with the architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart. The new square was a showcases of the new monumental Style Louis XIV. The old brick and stone of the Henry IV squares was replaced by the Grand Style of monumental columns, which usually were part of the facade itself, rather than standing separately. All the buildings around the square were connected and built to the same height, in the same style. The ground floor featured a covered arcade for pedestrians.Texier, Simon (2012), pp. 38-39 Between 1699 and 1702, another square was constructed also by Hardouin-Mansart. the Place Vend√¥me, In another innovation, this project was partially financed by the sale of lots around the square. All of these projects featured monumental facades in the Louis XIV style, giving a particular harmony to the squares.Texier, Simon (2012), pp. 38-39 Louis XV followed the example of Louis XIV. In the later years of his reign, Louis constructed a major new square in the center of the city, Place Louis XV (now Place de la Concorde, with a harmonious row of new buildings designed by Ange-Jacques Gabriel. Following the example of the earlier squares, it featured an equestrian statue of Louis XV, which was pulled down during the French Revolution. Louis XV built other monumental squares following the same architectural model in the centers of Rennes and Bordeaux. Another notable square, Place Stanislas, was built in the city of Nancy, in Lorraine, shortly before that Duchy was formally attached to France.

The first battle was instigated by settlers; the second war was the continuation of a grudge on the part of the Esopus tribe. Background Before European colonization, the Kingston area was inhabited by the Esopus people, a Lenape tribe which was estimated to number around 10,000 people living in small village communities by 1600. In 1609, Henry Hudson explored the river which was named after him, leading to the first contact between the Esopus people and Europeans. Dutch settlers built a factorij (trading post) in Kingston, New York in 1614. The Esopus tribe used the land for farming, and they destroyed the post and drove the settlers back to the south. Colonists established a new settlement in 1652 at Kingston, but the Esopus drove them out again. The settlers returned once again in 1658, as they believed the land to be good for farming. They built a stockade (at ) to defend the village and named the colony Wiltwijck. Skirmishes continued, but the Esopus were not able to repel the settlers, and they eventually granted the land to them. First Esopus War The First Esopus War was a short-lived conflict between Dutch settlers and the Esopus Indians from September 20, 1659 and July 15, 1660. An incident occurred where a group of Dutch settlers opened fire on a group of Esopus around a campfire, who had been celebrating with brandy given as payment for farm work. Esopus reinforcements raided Dutch settlements outside the stockade, destroying crops, killing livestock, and burning buildings. The war party later besieged the walled settlement of Wiltwijck. The colonists were outnumbered and had little hope of winning through force, but they managed to hold out and make some small attacks, including burning the Indians' fields to starve them out. They received reinforcements from New Amsterdam. The war concluded July 15, 1660, when the Indians agreed to trade land for food. Tensions remained between the Esopus and the settlers, however, eventually leading to the second war. Second Esopus War Emissaries from the colony contacted the tribe on June 5, 1663 and requested a meeting in hopes of making a treaty. The Esopus replied that it was their custom to conduct peace talks unarmed and in the open, so the settlers kept the gates open into Wiltwijck. The Esopus arrived on June 7 in great numbers, many claiming to be selling produce, thereby infiltrating deep into the town as scouts. Meanwhile, Esopus warriors completely destroyed the neighboring village of Nieu Dorp (Hurley, New York) unbeknownst to the colonists in Wiltwijck. The Esopus scouts had spread themselves around the town and suddenly began their own attack. They took the settlers completely by surprise and soon controlled much of the town, setting fire to houses and kidnapping women before being driven out by the settlers. The attackers escaped, and the settlers repaired their fortifications. On June 16, Dutch soldiers transporting ammunition to the town were attacked on their way from Rondout Creek, but they repelled the Esopus. Throughout July, colonial forces reconnoitered the Esopus Kill. They were unable to distinguish one tribe from another, and they captured some traders from the Wappinger tribe, one of whom agreed to help them. He gave them information about various Indian forces and served as a guide in the field. In spite of his help, the colonists were unable to make solid contact with the Esopus, who used guerilla tactics and could disappear easily into the woods. After several unproductive skirmishes, the colonists managed to gain the help of the Mohawk, who served as guides, interpreters, and warriors. By the end of July, the colonists had received sufficient reinforcements to march for the Esopus stronghold in the mountains to the north. However, their ponderous equipment made progress slow, and the terrain was difficult. They recognized their disadvantage and burned the surrounding fields in the hope of starving them out, rather than making a direct attack on the Esopus force. For the next month, scouting parties went out to set fire to the Esopus fields but found little other combat. In early September, another colonial force tried to engage the Esopus on their territory, this time successfully. The battle ended with the death of Chief Papequanaehen and several others. The Esopus fled, and the colonists led by Captain Martin Cregier pillaged their fort before retreating, taking supplies and prisoners. This effectively ended the war, although the peace was uneasy. Outcome First page of the 1665 treaty between the British colonies and the Esopus tribe forbidding hostility between Christians and Indians, including harming livestock and buildings The Dutch settlers remained suspicious of all Indians with whom they came into contact and expressed misgivings about the intentions of the Wappingers and even the Mohawks, who had helped them defeat the Esopus. Colonial prisoners taken captive by the Indians in the Second Esopus War were transported through regions that they had not yet explored, and they described the land to the colonial authorities who set out to survey it. Some of this land was later sold to French Huguenot refugees who established the village of New Paltz. In September 1664, the Dutch ceded New Netherland to the English. The English colonies redrew the boundaries of Indian territory, paid for land that they planned to settle, and forbad any further settlement on the established Indian lands without full payment and mutual agreement. The new treaty established safe passage for both settler and Indians for purposes of trading. It further declared \\"that all past Injuryes are buryed and forgotten on both sides,\\" promised equal punishment for settlers and Indians found guilty of murder, and paid traditional respects to the sachems and their people. Over the course of the next two decades, Esopus lands were bought up and the Indians moved out peacefully, eventually taking refuge with the Mohawks north of the Shawangunk mountains.

It was founded in 1979 by Brian Couzens.  Background  Chandos Records arose from a band music publisher Chandos Music, founded in 1963, and Chandos Productions, a record production company which produced LPs for Classics for Pleasure, and, especially, RCA's work in the UK. Its first record was Bloch's Sacred Service (ABR1001). Important early recordings were made with Mariss Jansons, Nigel Kennedy and the King's Singers ‚Äì before they moved to bigger contracts with EMI.Anderson C. \\"Thirty years of Chandos. Ralph and Brian Couzens talk about the history of their company:\\". Classic Record Collector, Winter 2008, 39‚Äì42. In 2005, Chandos Records was the first classical label to offer mp3s on its website. They now run The Classical Shop with over 45 labels on offer, including Naxos, LSO Live, Coro, Avie, Onyx, Alpha and many rarer European labels, which are not available in physical format in the UK. The name \\"Chandos\\" refers to James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos (1674‚Äì1744), at whose Palladian-style house, Cannons, the composer Handel was engaged as a composer-in-residence for a year (1717‚Äì1718). In addition to the eleven Chandos Anthems, Handel also wrote other works, including Acis and Galatea, at Cannons. The company originally had its office in Chandos House, Chandos Place, London SW1, the street name derived from the Duke.  Repertoire  The Chandos catalogue contains a range of classical music ‚Äì for example, much orchestral, choral and chamber music by such lesser- known British composers as Herbert Howells, Gerald Finzi, Charles Villiers Stanford and Arnold Bax, conducted by eminent conductors including Richard Hickox, Gianandrea Noseda, Neeme J√§rvi and Vernon Handley. They also specialise in early music, on their label Chaconne, with performances by artists such as the Purcell Quartet, Collegium Musicum 90 and Sophie Yates. Chandos is also known for its Movies series, preserving previously lost film scores. In 1990 they launched the Opera in English label, in association with the Peter Moores Foundation, which has resulted in over 80 recordings. Series include: * Complete symphonies of Alwyn, Vaughan Williams, Mahler, Arnold, Shostakovich, Bax * Tone poems of Liszt * Film Music series includes: Arnold, Shostakovich, Vaughan Willams, Bax, Korngold, Coates, Addinsell, Addison  Awards  Recordings released by Chandos have won many awards including \\"Gramophone Record of the Year\\" for Vaughan Williams's A London Symphony with the London Symphony Orchestra, and \\"Gramophone Choral Recording of the Year\\" for Hummel Masses. Chandos recordings have received five Grammy Awards: \\"Best Opera Recording\\" in 1997 for Britten's Peter Grimes and in 2008 for Engelbert Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel, \\"Best Engineered Classical Album\\" in 2008 for Gretchaninov's \\"Passion Week\\" and in 2013 for \\"Life and Breath\\" by the Kansas City Chorale, and \\"Best Choral Performance\\" for \\"Life and Breath.\\"Stott M.

Admitted to Princeton University, he would graduate with a bachelor's degree with honors in 1879, and with a master's degree in 1882. Meanwhile, he received a fellowship and studied at the University of Leipzig before returning to his home city and graduating first in his class at the University of Alabama Law School in 1882. He married Rachel Burgett in 1891, and the couple traveled in Europe. They would have a son (who died as a child) and two daughters. Active in Mobile society, Hamilton was a member of the Order of Myths as well as the Strikers Independent Society and the Mobile Rifle Company's drill team. Career After admission to the Alabama bar, Hamilton practiced law with his father's and uncle's prestigious firm. When his father suffered a stroke in 1885, Hamilton assisted Robert C. Brickell,http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-4096 the Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court in preparing a digest of Alabama laws. His uncle Thomas Hamilton would retire from the firm in 1894, which proved a critical year in Hamilton's life, because of his young son's death as well as own career transitions. Hamilton later helped codify Mobile's city ordinances in 1897. Hamilton's first book, Rambles in Historic Lands related his travels while in college and after marrying his wife. He would later help found the Iberville Historical Society as well as serve on the Alabama Historical Commission In 1891, Hamilton secured his first elective office, on the Mobile City Council. After serving for three years, he became the city attorney, as well as published his first history book, Art Work of Mobile and Vicinity (1894). His civic duties allowed him to work on his historical studies as well, so he published Colonial Mobile: An Historical Study (1897) (the first detailed relation of his native city's past, a revised edition of which would also later be published), Early Southern Institutions (1898), The Colonization of the South (1904), The Reconstruction Period (1910), and Mobile of the Five Flags (1913) (a high school textbook). Hamilton, a Democrat, was appointed as the federal judge for Puerto Rico in 1913 by President Woodrow Wilson, who was his classmate at Princeton University. (Hamilton actually was first nominated by outgoing President William Howard Taft, but it appears that this was a courtesy nomination on Wilson's behalf.) During World War I, Hamilton's wife and daughter were on a ship sunk by a German U-Boat off the New Jersey Coast, but were rescued from their lifeboat after two days. Hamilton served two four- year terms as District Judge in Puerto Rico, obtaining reappointment from President Wilson in 1917, but not reappointment by President Warren G. Harding despite presenting a 5,000 resident petition urging his re-nomination. Throughout his tenure, Hamilton was a strong proponent of bringing Puerto Rico under greater influence by the United States, and supported increased use of the English language in Puerto Rico. At one point, questions were raised concerning Hamilton's personal finances and any effect they might be having on his judicial service. An investigation by the Justice Department, failed to sustain the allegations. Hamilton tried to enhance the public reputation of his court and improved the its administration, keeping more current with the docket than had his predecessors. During his tenure he addressed the political status of Puerto Rico, issues relating to citizenship, and handled numerous commercial and criminal cases. At times, Hamilton's relations with Puerto Rico's governor Arthur Yager proved tense, notwithstanding that President Wilson had nominated both. Some local lawyers resented the federal court in Puerto Rico, which led to several (unsuccessful) attempts to induce the United States Congress to abolish the federal court. On the other hand, efforts by Hamilton to obtain life tenure for judges of the federal court in Puerto Rico, as is required for Article III federal courts, were also unsuccessful (that step was not ultimately taken until 1966). In 1921, President Warren G. Harding, a Republican, declined to reappoint Hamilton to a third term. He was succeeded by Arthur Odlin. Hamilton remained in Puerto Rico for several years. In addition to practicing law and continuing his travels in Europe and the Middle East, Hamilton taught law at the University of Puerto Rico. In 1922 he published Origin and Growth of the Common Law in England and America. He also wrote a series of articles for the Harvard Law Review comparing the common law and civil law systems, as well as an article on Puerto Rican folklore. As Hamilton and his wife developed health issues, they moved back to the mainland. Hamilton briefly taught law and was dean of the Southern Methodist University School of Lawto Dallas, Texas. Death and legacy Hamilton lived his final years with his daughter and her family Anniston, Alabama. He died on July 13, 1927. During his lifetime, he had presented bound copies of his articles to the Mobile Public Library. That library and the Alabama Department of Archives and History were to receive his notes and research files, but a fire destroyed them before delivery. Thus, only Hamilton's published books and articles and some correspondence can be found in those archives as well as in Puerto Rico. Although no full-length biography of Hamilton exists, his daughter, Rachel Duke Hamilton, and Puerto Rican historian Carmelo Delgado Cintron have both written about him. The Peter Joe Hamilton Elementary School in Chicasaw (in Mobile County) is named after Hamilton. References *Carmelo Delgado-Cintron, \\"El juez federal Peter J.

Luohan style is the oldest and the representative style of Shaolin Kung Fu. The original roots of Luohan style date back to the early eras of Shaolin temple. In Shaolin temple, there are various Luohan styles. Besides the Shaolin Luohan styles, there are many Luohan-related styles that have been developed in many other areas of China. Shaolin Luohan 18 hands and Luohan quan are always praised as the root styles based on which most the Shaolin kung fu styles and many other non-Shaolin styles have been created. Luohan and Shaolin Enlightenment (Nirvana) is one of the first concepts of Buddhism. The name Luohan, the Chinese equivalent of the Sanskrit (Indian) word Arhat, refers to those who have achieved enlightenment. Therefore, the ultimate goal of the monks of Shaolin temple, in particular, has always been to reach the level of becoming Luohans. Therefore, the Luohan(s) have always been holy icon(s) in the daily life and martial art of Shaolin temple monks. As far as related to Shaolin temple martial arts, the names Luohan quan and Shaolin quan are often considered synonyms and therefore interchangeable. Luohan's 18 hands There are various Luohan's 18 hands styles. These are the most important ones: Shaolin Luohan's 18 hands A myth states that Bodhidharma, while visiting the Shaolin Temple taught the monks a series of exercises. Whether this story is right or wrong, based on Buddhist teachings, by observing and imitating the forms and expressions of Arhat statues in the temple, meditation and practice, those ancient exercises later evolved into a combat form called \\"18 hands of Luohan\\" (), which is the oldest documented, systematized style of Shaolin Kung Fu. According to the historical official text of Shaolin temple, \\"Shaolin Kung fu Manual\\" (), in the Sui dynasty (581-618 AD) Shaolin monks had a selected set of 18 simple movements; until the Tang dynasty (618-907 AD) the set had developed into 18 martial postures, that were combined into a form (); the number of the postures increased to 36 until the early Song dynasty (960 AD); and in the Jin-Yuan dynasty (1115-1368 AD) it was developed into 173 movements; finally, in the Ming dynasty the system of the 18 hands of Luohan was completed in 18 forms, each form having 18 postures, making a total of 324 postures. In Shaolin, this style is called \\"inborn Luohan's 18 hands\\" (), because it was the style with which Shaolin kung fu was born. Monk Shi Deqian, in his efforts to document Shaolin martial arts collected 8 forms of the 18 hands of Luohan into his \\"Encyclopedia of Shaolin martial arts\\". Of these forms, most lineages of Shaolin monks have mostly kept only one form, mostly the first, or the eighth form. Shaolin Luohan's 18 hands movements are simple and straight. The methods are mostly done by the palms of the hands. Fists, hook hands, and other hand gestures and kicks are less used. Luohan's 18 hands are considered the elementary forms in Shaolin kung fu. Shaolin/Hua quan Luohan's 18 hands There is another Luohan's 18 hands style which is different from the original Shaolin Luohan's 18 hands but is more famous. This Luohan's 18 hands style has 18 different methods, consisted of 6 different methods of fist, 1 method of elbow, 2 methods of palm, 4 methods of leg, and 5 methods of joint locking. Of these 18 methods, a form of 24 movements for attack and defense is developed, which can be performed as a solo form or as a duet form. This style is originally from the Hua quan style of Shandong province, was brought to the Louyang area of Henan Province (close to Shaolin Temple) and was later been adopted into Shaolin curriculum, along with its sister set Ba Bu Lian Huan Quan. Shaolin Guard the Mountain of Child Gate Luohan's 18 hands Guard the Mountain of Child Gate Luohan's 18 hands () is a less known Luohan's 18 hands style. This style has 32 movements, which in total make 18 postures. Shaolin Luohan's 18 hands of Dengfeng area There is another less known Luohan's 18 hands style that has been passed down by Li Gensheng (), a famous master from Dengfeng county near Shaolin. The 18 movements of this style are very similar to the first form of one version of Shaolin 18 Luohan quan. These kinds of movements are also used in the Tong Bi quan style of the western courtyard of Shaolin temple. Luohan quan There are various Luohan quan styles. These are the most important ones: Shaolin Luohan quan Luohan quan is considered a completely pure Buddhist Shaolin style. It is the most famous, and of the most important styles of Shaolin kung fu. Shaolin monks developed Luohan quan as an advanced style based on the 18 hands of Luohan. Luohan quan has been created in the early ages of Shaolin temple, but it was first officially documented by Shaolin monks in the \\"Shaolin Kung Fu Manual\\" in the early years of the Song dynasty in 960s AD. This style has two forms called small () and big () Luohan quan, which are considered the oldest excellent styles of Shaolin temple. There is a famous quote that Shaolin Luohan quan has in total 108 different movements. Small Luohan quan has 27 postures/36 movements and big Luohan quan has about 54 postures/72 movements, so 108 movements in total. Big Luohan quan is itself divided into 3 smaller 18-posture forms. Shi Deyang, 31st generation Shaolin monk talks about 6 forms of big Luohan quan, but most people only know these 3 forms. The first 2 forms/sections of big Luohan quan, which has 36 postures in total, is an ancient form called golden child small Luohan quan (). Shaolin small and big Luohan quans are also practiced by the folk people of Dengfeng area around Shaolin in a less Luohan-imitative version, which drops out or simplifies the Luohan-imitating postures of Shaolin original Luohan quan. Shaolin Luohan quan movements, though simple, are highly advanced and deceptive. Attack and defense are masked by Luohan Buddhist postures and come out from unlikely angles. Shaolin 18 Luohan quan During the centuries, Luohan quan was developed. A major contribution was by monk Jue Yuan and two others named Li Sou and Bai Yufeng. Finally, as a result of the developments since the Jin and Yuan dynasties until the middle and late Ming dynasty, a Luohan quan system of 18 forms was created, one form for each one of the famous Luohans, which at those times had increased in number to 18 in Chan Buddhism. In this style, each Luohan form is divided into 3 sections, so it has 54 sections in total. This style is less imitative than small&big; Luohan quan style and has given up or, at least, transformed many of the famous Luohan-imitating postures. 18 Luohan quan, though very famous, is rarely known. Even inside Shaolin, only a few people in each generation inherit this style completely. There are different versions of 18 Luohan quan. One version has 18 forms for the 18 Luohans, while there are other versions with 9 long forms which altogether represent 18 Luohan characters. As an estimation of the diversity, just notice that Shaolin monk Shi Degen (1914-1970) taught 3 seemingly different versions to 3 of his disciples, Liu Zhenhai, Shi Yongwen, and Zhu Tianxi. Shaolin Luohan's 108 methods of combat The \\"108 combat methods of Arhat\\" is a set of 108 fighting methods of hitting and grappling (throwing, locking, and take- downs), which have been created and developed by Shaolin monks of various generations. There are also a few smaller and a bigger such set of \\"360 combat methods of Arhat\\" in Shaolin. Other Luohan styles There is a famous saying, \\"all martial arts under heaven originated from Shaolin,\\" and all styles at Shaolin originated from Luohan 18 hands and Luohan quan. Because of the historical and technical effects of Shaolin temple on other styles, Luohan styles of Shaolin are the roots of many many other styles. There are many styles with the name Luohan quan created and developed outside of Shaolin temple: In Henan province which Shaolin temple is located, there are several Luohan quans. In the nearby provinces of Hebei and Shandong, in the southern provinces of Zhejiang and Fujian, and the southwestern province of Sichuan, where Emei mountain is located, and also in south China sea area there are many different Luohan styles. For example, in Fujian there are more than 5 different Luohan quans recognized. The Luohan's 18 hands style of Hua quan from Shandong province is also very famous, so that it is even practiced by some lineages of Shaolin monks. Some of these Luohan styles have over exaggerated Luohan imitating tastes, while some do not have any Luohan-looking characteristics.

Facade of the Colegio de San Gregorio, Valladolid The Isabelline style, also called the Isabelline Gothic (in Spanish, G√≥tico Isabelino), or Castilian late Gothic, was the dominant architectural style of the Crown of Castile during the reign of the Catholic Monarchs, Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon in the late-15th century to early-16th century. The Frenchman √âmile Bertaux named the style after Queen Isabella. It represents the transition between late Gothic and early Renaissance architecture, with original features and decorative influences of the Castilian tradition, the Flemish, the Mud√©jar, and to a much lesser extent, Italian architecture. The consideration or not of the Isabelline as a Gothic or Renaissance style, or as an Eclectic style, or as a phase within a greater Plateresque generic, is a question debated by historians of art and unresolved.\\"... is not satisfactory the supposedly enlightening the denomination of Gothic Plateresque, from the terminology adopted by D. Bay√≥n for what Durliat called as Isabelline style and, as a binder of the one and the other (Mar√≠as), because if conceptually there is continuity, the ornamental repertoire used is very different, and there is no record of the use of the term for the medieval decorative fantasies. \\" Soto Caba, Virginia. \\"The Platersque issue\\" in ArteHistoria. Overview The Isabelline style introduced several structural elements of the Castilian tradition and the typical Flanders's flamboyant forms, as well as some ornaments of Mud√©jar influence. Many of the buildings that were built in this style were commissioned by the Catholic Monarchs or were in some way sponsored by them. A similar style called Manueline developed concurrently in Portugal. The most obvious characteristic of the Isabelline is the predominance of heraldic and epigraphic motifs, especially the symbols of the yoke and arrows and the pomegranate, which refer to the Catholic Monarchs. Also characteristic of this period is ornamentation using beaded motifs of orbs worked in plaster or carved in stone. After the Catholic Monarchs had completed the Reconquista in 1492 and started the colonization of the Americas, imperial Spain began to develop a consciousness of its growing power and wealth, and in its exuberance launched a period of construction of grand monuments to symbolize them. Many of these monuments were built at the command of the Queen; thus Isabelline Gothic manifested the desire of the Spanish ruling classes to display their own power and wealth. This exuberance found a parallel expression in the extreme profusion of decoration which has been called Plateresque. Lower cloister of the Monastery of San Juan de los Reyes, Toledo Facade of Iglesia de Santa Mar√≠a la Real in Aranda de Duero References to classical antiquity in the architecture of Spain were more literary, whereas in Italy, the prevalence of Roman-era buildings had given 'Gothic' a meaning adapted to Italian classicist taste. Until the Renaissance took hold in the Iberian peninsula, the transition from the 'Modern' to the 'Roman' in Spanish architecture had hardly begun. These terms were applied with a meaning different from what one would expect ‚Äì the 'Modern', an originally Spanish style, referred to the Gothic and its rational efficiency,Maroto, J. Historia del Arte, Casals, , pg. 195, citing, among others, to Diego de Sagredo Las Medidas del Romano, 1526. while the 'Roman' was the neoclassical or emotional and sensualist style of the Italian Renaissance architecture. Regardless of the spatial characteristics of the interiors, Gothic buildings utilized proven structural systems. The Gothic style in the Iberian Peninsula had undergone a series of changes under the influence of local tradition, including much smaller windows, which allowed the construction of roofs with substantially less pitch. This made for a truly original style, yet more efficient construction. Spanish architects, accustomed to their Gothic structural conventions, looked with some contempt on the visible metal braces that Italian architects were forced to put on their buildings' arches to resist horizontal thrust, while their own Gothic building methods had avoided this problem. The development of classical architecture in the Iberian Peninsula, as elsewhere, had been moribund during the centuries of building construction done in the Gothic tradition, and the neoclassical movement of the Italian Renaissance was late to arrive there. A unique style with modern elements evolved from the Gothic inheritance in Spain. Perhaps the best example of this syncretistic style is the Monastery of San Juan de los Reyes in Toledo; designed by the architect Juan Guas, its Gothic ideals are expressed more in the construction than in the design of the interior space, as the relationship with original French Gothic building techniques had receded with the passage of time. In the Isabelline style, decorative elements of Italianate origin were combined with Iberian traditional elements to form ornamental complexes that overlaid the structures, while retaining many Gothic elements, such as pinnacles and pointed arches. Isabelline architects clung to the Gothic solution of the problem of how to distribute the weight burden of vaults pressing on pillars (not on the walls, as in the Romanesque or Italian Renaissance styles): that is, by propping them up with flying buttresses. After 1530, although the Isabelline style continued to be used and its decorative ornaments were still evolving, Spanish architecture began to incorporate Renaissance ideas of form and structure.

It is primarily embodied in the works of Christopher Wren, Nicholas Hawksmoor, John Vanbrugh, and James Gibbs, although a handful of lesser architects such as Thomas Archer also produced buildings of significance. In domestic architecture and interior decor, Baroque qualities can sometimes be seen in the late phase of the Restoration style, the William and Mary style, the Queen Anne style, and the early Georgian style. History Sir Christopher Wren presided over the genesis of the English Baroque manner, which differed from the continental models by clarity of design and subtle taste for classicism. Following the Great Fire of London, Wren rebuilt fifty-three churches, where Baroque aesthetics are apparent primarily in dynamic structure and multiple changing views. His most ambitious work was St Paul's Cathedral (1675‚Äì1711), which bears comparison with the most effulgent domed churches of Italy and France. In this majestically proportioned edifice, the Palladian tradition of Inigo Jones is fused with contemporary continental sensibilities in masterly equilibrium. Less influential were straightforward attempts to engraft the Berniniesque vision onto British church architecture (e.g., by Thomas Archer in St. John's, Smith Square, 1728) and the contemporary mood soon shifted toward the stripped down orthodoxy of British Palladianism popularised by Colen Campbell's influential Vitruvius Britannicus. Baroque aesthetics, whose influence was so potent in mid-17th century France, made little impact in England during the Protectorate and the first Restoration years. Colen Campbell, writing in 1715, declared the Italians had lost all taste for architecture in the pursuit of capricious novelties. Borromini was basest of all: \\"He had endeavoured to debauch Mankind with his odd and chimerical beauties, where the parts are without proportion, Solids without their true Bearing, Heaps of materials without strength, excessive ornamentation without grace, and the whole without symmetry.\\" Seaton Delaval Hall by Sir John Vanbrugh, 1718. Although Wren was also active in secular architecture, the first truly Baroque country house in England was built to a design by William Talman at Chatsworth, starting in 1687. The culmination of Baroque architectural forms comes with Sir John Vanbrugh and Nicholas Hawksmoor. Each was capable of a fully developed architectural statement, yet they were known to work in tandem, most notably at Castle Howard (1699) and Blenheim Palace (1705). Appuldurcombe House, Isle of Wight, now in ruins, but conserved by English Heritage, must also be mentioned. Castle Howard is a flamboyant assembly of restless masses dominated by a cylindrical domed tower. Blenheim is a more solid construction, where the massed stone of the arched gates and the huge solid portico becomes the main ornament. Vanbrugh's final work was Seaton Delaval Hall (1718), a comparatively modest mansion yet unique in the structural audacity of its style. It was at Seaton Delaval that Vanbrugh, a skillful playwright, achieved the peak of Restoration drama, once again highlighting a parallel between Baroque architecture and contemporary theatre. Despite his efforts, Baroque was never truly to the English taste and well before his death in 1724 the style had lost currency in Britain. In the early 18th century, the style was associated with Toryism, the Continent and Popery by the dominant Whig aristocracy. At Wentworth Woodhouse, Thomas Watson-Wentworth and his son Thomas Watson-Wentworth, 1st Marquess of Rockingham replaced a Jacobean house with a substantial Baroque one in the 1720s, only to find fellow Whigs unimpressed. As a result, a large Palladian building was added, leaving the older one intact. References *Downes, Kerry. English Baroque Architecture. London, A. Zwemmer, 1966.

Her closest musical associates were Eugene Chadbourne and John Zorn. She also played on records by William Parker and Frank Lowe. Her music career ended when she moved to California sometime in the 1980s. Her last appearance on record was on Zorn's The Big Gundown in 1986.  Biography  \\"I began playing music when I was 8 or 9. First piano, then violin. I preferred to play classical literature, but I started improvising by playing piano in a high school stage band. I studied jazz in college after hearing Cecil Taylor I started developing a style of improvisation on the piano, playing with many different musicians and performing occasionally. When I met Eugene Chadbourne and John Zorn on moving to New York, I quit playing the piano and concentrated on the violin. My playing really changed and so did my attitudes about music and improvising...\\" (from Bradfield's own liner notes on the back of her Solo Violin Improvisations LP)  Influences & Influenced  In the same liner notes, she lists her musical inspirations: Paganini, Bart√≥k, Ives, Ligeti, Django Reinhardt, Stuff Smith, Eddie South, Joe Venuti, The Sacred Guitar and Violin music of the Modern Aztecs, Jean Carignan, Swedish fiddle music, and Cajun string bands. (She also thanks Zorn and Chadbourne for their effect on her music.) A song named after Polly Bradfield was released by Two Of Substance in early 2019.  Solo music  In 1979 she released an LP on Chadbourne's Parachute label called Solo Violin Improvisations. The cover shows a photo of a young girl, presumably Bradfield as a child, sawing a branch off a tree, a pun on violin playing described as \\"sawing\\". The album contains more silence than sawing, though; her scrapes, scratches, plunks, and occasional notes on the violin are often separated by long stretches of it. Her radically still, non-discursive, Cageian style on this little known LP foreshadows later trends in free improvisation. Eugene Chadbourne describes the album as \\"a controlled masterwork of severely intense playing\\" . In her liner notes, Bradfield writes \\"The music on this record is all acoustic violin. Usually I use an amplifier when performing, but I wanted my first solo recording to be acoustic. I felt it was a small way to pay homage to the instrument's long and diverse history which began long before electricity was discovered.\\"  Remarks from other musicians   Kevin Drumm  \\"Whatever happened to Polly? Amazing and unique solo LP released on Eugene Chadbourne‚Äôs Parachute label. Best solo improv record ever.\\" (from Dusted Magazine )  Eugene Chadbourne  \\"...violinist Polly Bradfield... whatever happened to her? She's still playing. She had a lot of children and went out to California. She was never that driven to have a musical career. She was a really interesting musician though, I really liked her. Very extreme. I think her solo violin album is one of the best things I've ever heard. Do you know that? I have to send you a copy. I've got lots of copies, because when she left New York, in a big hurry, she piled her records out in the street, so I kept them; every now and then I meet somebody who wants one or who I think ought to have one. We did a couple of concerts together in England and Belgium that came out on a record, Torture Timethat was another nice album.\\" (from an interview by Dan Warburton )  Fred Frith  \\"Polly Bradfield‚Äôs solo playing was quite different  harder, less lyrical and treading a tightrope between controlled and contrived. I thought she had a lot of bottle actually, because she‚Äôs chosen a difficult path; her playing is austere and uncompromising, a little stiff; she takes chances; her use of silence is similar to John Zorn‚Äôs, though her humour‚Äôs dryer (it‚Äôs there though). After she‚Äôd played I felt mentally excited but earthbound.\\"  John Zorn  \\"About seven and a half minutes into the fourth take of \\"Lacrosse\\", Polly Bradfield plucks the C natural... this note was one of the great musical experiences of my life... notes like this C natural... are what music is all about for me, but they are too rare.\\" (from his liner notes to School) Discography * The Frank Lowe Orchestra, Lowe and Behold (Musicworks, 1978; recorded 1977) * Eugene Chadbourne & John Zorn, School (Parachute, 1978) * William Parker, Through Acceptance of the Mystery Peace (Centering, 1979) * Polly Bradfield, Solo Violin Improvisations (Parachute, 1979) * Eugene Chadbourne, 2000 Statues/The English Channel (Parachute, 1979) * Leslie Dalaba, LP (Parachute?) * Andrea Centazzo, Environment for Sextet (Ictus, 1979) * Andrea Centazzo, USA Concerts (Ictus, 1979) * John Zorn, Pool (Parachute, 1980) * Eugene Chadbourne & Polly Bradfield, Torture Time (Parachute, 1981) * John Zorn, Archery (Parachute, 1982) * Curlew, North America (Moers, 1986; recorded 1984-85) * John Zorn, The Big Gundown (Nonesuch, 1986) * Eugene Chadbourne & John Zorn, Sonora (1977‚Äì1981) (Materiali Sonori, 1998) * John Zorn, The Parachute Years (Tzadik, 1997) * John Zorn, Lacrosse (Tzadik, 2000; recorded 1978) * Eugene Chadbourne, Vision- Ease (House of Chadula, 2000; recorded 1978) * John Zorn, Hockey (Tzadik, 2002) References  External links  * Polly Bradfield page at Answers.com with text by Eugene Chadbourne * John Zorn discography with details on many of the recordings listed above Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American violinists Category:Free improvisation violinists Category:21st-century violinists ","title":"Polly Bradfield"},{"id":"5815129","text":"Luciana Caporaso (born 23 June 1973 in London), simply known as Luciana, is a British artist, actress, singer, DJ, and songwriter. She is of English and Italian heritage. Career 1994‚Äì2005: Acting and One More River Caporaso made her acting debut in 1994, in the final episode on the short lived British TV series, Anna Lee. On the show, she sang the track \\"Sister Sister\\" and other incidental songs. Caporaso signed with Chrysalis Records (part of Global Radio) and, in 1994, released her first solo single, \\"Get It Up for Love\\", which was produced by Dancin' Danny D from the band D Mob. The follow-up single was \\"If You Want\\". The third and final release was a double A-sided single and her first ballad, \\"One More River\\", and was coupled with the pop-dance track \\"What Goes Around\\", all three songs charted in the UK Singles Chart and were featured on the album One More River. After the poor sales of her three solo singles, Caporaso parted company with Chrysalis Records. In 1996, Caporaso replaced Jayni Hoy, in the band Crush. Their second album was the self-titled Crush (the first with Caporaso) was released in 1997 by Robbins Entertainment. Caporaso performed with several other artists including Tomoki Hirata, on the single \\"Facing Up\\", released in 1997 on the Interstate label. In 1998, she appeared on the single, \\"I Don't Know if I Should Call You Baby\\", released by Electrik Funk Records. 2006‚Äì2010: Featured artist and collaborative success After several sessions in the studio with production duo Bodyrox she featured on their single \\"Yeah Yeah\\" released by Eye Industries in 2006. The song went on to achieve mainstream success in the UK and across Europe, the song peaked 2 on the UK Singles Chart. This song had both a mainstream and sensual videoclip. The following year in 2007 she featured on Super Mal's song \\"Bigger Than Big\\". The song also achieved critical and commercial success in the dance industry and peaked number 19 on the UK Singles Chart. On 3 March 2008, the song \\"Come On Girl\\" by Taio Cruz was released, on which she featured. It peaked at number 5 in the UK Singles Chart, and appeared in the album Featuring Luciana, which was released later the same week. She guested on Gaydar Radio in November 2009 to perform her single \\"I Like That\\". The song attracted over fifteen million views on YouTube, and went on to peak at #3 on the Australian Singles Chart, knocking Lady Gaga and Beyonc√©'s \\"Telephone\\" off the number one spot the Australian Dance Chart. In July 2010, \\"I Like That\\" was certified Double Platinum in Australia, for sales in excess of 140,000 units. In 2010, she and song writing partner Nick Clow, wrote \\"Cupid Boy\\", which appeared on Kylie Minogue's album, Aphrodite. In 2010, Caporaso recorded two tracks; \\"I Got My Eye on You\\" with Nari & Milani and Cristian Marchi, and \\"Figure It Out\\" with Dave Aud√© under the name Isha Coco. 2011‚Äìpresent: Upcoming EP and solo success After moving to the U.S in late 2010, Caporaso recorded a song entitled \\"I'm Still Hot\\" which was produced by Dave Aud√© and was released on 19 April 2011 in the UK and 29 April 2011 in the US. In September 2011 a new version of \\"I'm Still Hot\\" which featured Betty White was released as a digital single on 22 September 2011 for a life settlement firm, The Lifeline Program. \\"I'm Still Hot\\" was played on ABC's Charlie's Angels and the CW's 'Ringer. The song peaked number one on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Songs Chart, marking Luciana's first ever song to chart in the US as solo performer. The song also managed to chart in the top 40 on the Australian iTunes Chart. She also later collaborated with London rapper Professor Green on his album \\"At Your Inconvenience\\". She confirmed in an interview with SnapCackle that she is working with producers Benny Benassi, deadmau5 and Dave Aud√© for her 6 track EP, which was expected in 2012, though was then most likely to see a release sometime in 2013. She later collaborated again with Richard Vission on a track \\"When It Feels Good\\" and claimed her 4th number one on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Songs Chart. In 2013, she released her fourth solo single \\"U B The Bass\\" and it peaked number 6 on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Songs Chart and 88 in Australia. July 2014 saw the release of Luciana's collaboration with DJ Hardwell and Joey Dale. The track was called \\"Arcadia\\" and was released on Revealed Recordings. In 2015, Luciana released, with KSHMR and Firebeatz, the song \\"No Heroes\\". In 2016, Luciana and Aude teamed up do an updated version of \\"Yeah Yeah,\\" this time billed as \\"Yeah Yeah 2017,\\" which reached number one on Billboard's Dance Club Songs Chart the week of 25 February 2017, giving Luciana her sixth number one on this chart and Aude his record setting fourteenth. In a 16 February 2017 interview with Billboard, Luciana explained how she and Aude came up with the idea to remake the song: \\"I feel very blessed and grateful right now. I am literally doing high kicks around my kitchen table as we speak! 'Yeah Yeah' is the track that started everything for me. I have always felt so passionate about it, so when Dave Aude said to me, 'Let's do a new 2017 version,' I knew it had to be right, and I think we nailed it. This No. 1 feels like the icing on the cake for me.\\"\\"Luciana & Dave Aude Say 'Yeah' to Topping Dance Club Songs Chart\\" from Billboard (16 February 2017) Vocal style From 2006 on, Caporaso has used two separate singing styles using two separate performing names. When singing as \\"Luciana\\", Caporaso's vocal style often revolves around sassy, playful, rhythmic speech-song, often with intentionally brazen lyrics and speaking quality, interspersed with bits of outright singing. Because of the lack of tonal quality to this style, the backing music for many of her songs incorporate bass and synth licks that move through chromatic scale segments, giving the music an unusual, edgy sound that contrasts the completely tonal (or modal) music that forms nearly all of the music by other artists in the dance/electronic and pop genres. Meanwhile, in contrast, her \\"Isha Coco\\" voice is a more traditional chanteuse style. The two identities enable her to make music in the two styles without confusing the Luciana \\"brand\\"; many listeners may not even realise that Luciana and Isha Coco are the same vocalist. Other work Visual Art Caporaso created her first collection of art work entitled Icon in 2004, which consisted of portraits of those individuals who have dominated popular culture for the past 50 years. Her original artwork combined photography, painting and silver and gold leaves. She has also produced both posters and album sleeves for record labels. Bands Caporaso formed the band Shooter and released the album ..And Your Point, which featured, \\"Life's a Bitch\\", released as a single in 1999 for the Dawson's Creek soundtrack. She formed another group called Portobella and, in 2004, released \\"Covered in Punk\\" with Island Records. The follow-up single, released in 2005, was \\"Viva La Difference\\". Portobella split up later in the year after little mainstream success.

The band's second release for RCA Records, the album followed the platinum-selling Villains and its mammoth single, \\"The Freshmen\\". The band worked with Soundgarden producer Michael Beinhorn and created a generally dark, sonically textured grunge-pop album. The lead single \\"Hero\\" received sporadic airplay on alternative rock radio and its video was in rotation on MTV2 in late summer 1999. Throughout the album, primary songwriter and singer Brian Vander Ark comments on the fleeting nature of fame with tracks such as \\"Supergig\\" and \\"Headlines\\". The song \\"The F Word\\" serves as a bittersweet response to the band's success with \\"The Freshmen\\". The album's cover features a diagram for frog dissection, with the song titles used as references to various body parts. Radio and touring The Verve Pipe mounted a major nationwide tour in support of The Verve Pipe and lead single \\"Hero\\", headlining mid-size venues and playing numerous radio festivals throughout 1999 and into 2000. With the Nu metal stylings of Limp Bizkit and Korn dominating rock radio airwaves, \\"Hero\\" failed to connect with a mass audience. The band responded by releasing the album's sonically heaviest track, \\"Television\\", as a follow-up single.

History The initial proposals to build a hospital in Oxford were put forward at a meeting of the Radcliffe Trustees, who were administering John Radcliffe's estate valued at ¬£4,000, in 1758. The facility was constructed on land given by Thomas Rowney, one of the two members of parliament for Oxford. The foundation stone was laid on 27 August 1761 and the new facility was officially opened on 18 October 1770. A fountain of the Greek god Triton was placed in front of the main infirmary building in 1858 and the Oxford Eye Hospital was established on the site in 1886.A brief history of the Nuffield Laboratory of Ophthalmology During the First World War, the hospital was converted for military use as the Third Southern General Hospital. Officers were treated in Somerville College, which was also converted, and other ranks were treated in the infirmary. A number of pioneering moments in medical history occurred at the hospital. Penicillin was first tested on patients on 27 January 1941 and the Nuffield Laboratory of Ophthalmology was founded on the site in 1942. The entrance of the hospital was seen in the ITV television series Inspector Morse in 1991. The first Utah Array (later known as the BrainGate) implantation in a human (Kevin Warwick) took place on 14 March 2002. After services had been transferred to purpose-built buildings at the John Radcliffe and Churchill Hospitals in nearby Headington, the infirmary closed for medical use in 2007.Oxford University takes over Radcliffe Infirmary site Following refurbishment, the infirmary building was re-opened in October 2012 for use by the Faculty of Philosophy and both the Philosophy and Theology libraries of the University of Oxford. The site, which is now known as the Radcliffe Observatory Quarter, also became home to the Blavatnik School of Government in 2012.

Early life The son of Major Lawrence Kimball,\\"Kimball (Life Baron UK), Marcus Richard Kimball\\", Dod's Parliamentary Companion, ed. Andrew Cox, et al,, Vacher Dod Publishing, 1999 he was born in Marylebone, London, and educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. He became a farmer and a Lloyd's underwriter. He was a councillor on Rutland County Council and commanded a squadron of the Leicestershire Yeomanry. Political career Kimball contested Derby South in 1955. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Gainsborough from a 1956 by-election until 1983. While representing this constituency, he wrote to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, after Argentina's invasion of the Falkland Islands, that he felt the British government should \\"let the Argentinians have the Falklands with as little fuss as possible\\". This letter, apparently written without the knowledge of his constituency party, remained secret until revealed by the release of part of the Thatcher archive in 2013. According to his obituary he treated his constituents in much the same way as he treated the tenants of his Market Harborough and Altnaharra estates advising potential MPs not to promise to hold surgeries and not to live in the constituency unless sure there was a good local hunt. Kimball opposed separate taxation for women in 1978, saying women just gave the bill to their husbands. Knighted in 1981, Kimball was subsequently given a life peerage as Baron Kimball, of Easton in the County of Leicestershire on 9 May 1985. Hunting interests A keen huntsman, Kimball was joint master of the Fitzwilliam Hunt 1952 and 1953, and the Cottesmore Hunt 1953‚Äì58. He was chairman of the British Field Sports Society 1966‚Äì82, and its President 1996‚Äì98. He was vice-president of its successor organisation, the Countryside Alliance from 1998. He also held senior positions in greyhound racing, show jumping and light horse breeding organisations and in the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. Lord Kimball indirectly gave money to an anti- field sports organisation after an Industrial Tribunal ruled that he sacked his housekeeper unfairly and she donated part of her compensation. He died at the age of 85 on 26 March 2014.

His public service programs have helped ease the plights of many suffering Filipinos, including OCWs (Overseas Contract Workers who are now referred to as OFWs -Overseas Filipino Workers) and their families. He became the link of the ordinary Filipino to the government and its agencies in solving their problems.

Known for his unique and unmistakable booming voice, Pareng Rey or Sky, has been on the air for more than four decades. Millions of Filipinos start their day listening to Pareng Rey on the radio as he informs them of the current events and pressing issues that affect their lives. During the People Power Revolution that installed Cory Aquino into power in 1986, Langit was continuously on the air for two days. Other radio stations had stopped broadcasting midway into the revolt, but Langit refused to be silenced. His voice became the only resource for millions of Filipinos who wanted to know what was going on in the country's capital. He reported on troop movements all over the city, and as ordinary citizens began walking out of their homes, and gathering on the streets to keep vigil and form human barricades. Langit first used the term \\"People Power\\", which went on to become the popular term used for the first peaceful revolution. In 1989, with the Aquino Administration far from being stable, Langit once more became the voice that the Filipino masses listened to as he courageously reported on what became a series of coup d'√©tat attempt to overthrow the Aquino administration. Pareng Rey Langit was awarded the prestigious \\"Radio Broadcast Journalist of the Year\\" award given by the Rotary Club of Manila the following year. In 2004, Langit was once more named \\"Radio Broadcast Journalist of the Year\\" by the Rotary Club of Manila for his outstanding achievements in public service through broadcast media and his exceptional and in- depth reports on relevant and important issues. He was cited for his dedication to helping overseas Filipino workers through his various TV and radio programs. Aside from being an admired and multi-awarded broadcaster, Langit is also an accomplished leader. He was the Station Manager of the AM Radio station DWIZ 882 kHz. and vice president of Aliw Broadcasting Corporation until 2016 where he decided to run again as a Senator but lost in the elections. After the elections and the death of Aliw Broadcasting Corporation chairman Antonio Cabangon-Chua, Langit bid goodbye to his station for 24 years, DWIZ and transferred to DZRJ 810 kHz Radyo Bandido (which his radio program continues to air until now) and PTV as anchor of programs \\"Insider Exclusive Kapihan\\" \\"Kasangga Mo ang Langit\\" (which his TV program also airs over RJ DigiTV), and \\"Balitang Tanghali\\". He is also the chairman of the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas-Metro Manila Chapter and is a member of the board of directors of the KBP-National.

It was adapted into an original video animation (OVA) released on July 20, 1985. The OVA was released as a double feature with the Area 88 film. The story follows Justy Kaizard, a police officer who chases down criminal espers; his tactics might be similar to those of a bounty hunter but he is a salary-drawing officer. Justy is also an esper with remarkable powers. He is able to moderate his psychic forces by the use of the headband that he wears. With this device, which acts only as a psychic damper, he can finely attenuate his powers to prevent collateral damage. Viz translated part of the manga into English and released nine out-of-order issues in North America between December 6, 1988 and April 4, 1989. Plot summary Justy Kaizard is the most powerful esper in the known universe, and he works as a member of the Galaxy Patrol System Cosmo Police to bring down esper criminals. During one such takedown, he killed Magnamum Vega while his young daughter Astaris was watching. After the fight, she transformed from a young girl into a young woman and attacked him. While he was wounded in her attack, she forgot everything. Justy took the girl home and began raising her as his younger sister with the help of Jelna Flarestar. Because he has brought down over 200 esper criminals since joining the Cosmo Police, the rest of the esper criminals are willing to do anything to get rid of Justy. To this end, they hijack a civilian shuttle transport and demand that Astaris, Magnamum's daughter, be brought in exchange for the passengers on board the transport. Justy is assigned to take her there, but as she is making the EVA journey between ships, a group of the criminal espers joins together using telepathy to make her remember what happened to her father and who was responsible for it. Astaris begins attacking the policeman, destroying Justy's ship and using more and more power to try to break through his defenses. Worried for the safety of the nearby transport, Justy uses his powers to teleport it away from the fight. In doing so, he lets down his guard and Astaris is able to hit him with the full force of her powers, causing him to disappear. The criminal espers believe they have destroyed him, so they take the transport with all the hostages and warp away, leaving Astaris floating in space. Astaris comes out of her rage and begins wondering what happened and where Justy went. She then falls asleep, exhausted. After the shuttle leaves, Justy appears and rescues the sleeping Astaris, promising to bring the criminal espers to justice for using her in their ploy. After surrounding Astaris in a protective bubble, Justy warps after the escaping transport. After teleporting onto the transport, Justy eliminates three of the hijackers before the others teleport in an attempt to escape. He easily follows them. He handily defeats all but four of them after demanding that they return Astaris to the way she was. The remaining four combine their powers to try to defeat Justy, but he eliminates them one by one until he's down to the ringleader. He tells him that Astaris is his beloved younger sister now, and proceeds to eliminate him. Justy returns and rescues Astaris, and the voiceover as they return shows that Astaris remembers nothing of her attack on Justy and has returned to loving him as her heroic older brother. The show ends with Justy and his partner going out on another mission. Characters The characters of Justy, Jelna, and Bolba previously appeared in Okazaki's debut manga 2nd Year A Class Hoshiko-sensei. ; :Born (or at least found in a shipwreck) on Sapphire, the sixth planet in the Pelwing System, Justy is an esper in the Galaxy Patrol Cosmo Police, with the designation Œ£04-1 (Sigma 04-1). Despite being the most powerful esper in the known universe, Justy has a kind heart. He helps track down superhuman criminals to bring them to justice, even though it pains him to have to use his powers this way. He wears a hairband which regulates his esper powers to one ten-thousandth their normal strength. The headband would normally completely suppress the power of an esper, but due to the strength of his powers, it allows him greater fine control over them. :During the Great Galactic War, Justy fought alongside Jelna and her group as part of the Esper Commandos against the Andromeda Rebel Army. His foster-sister, Jelna, is his only family, and because of the hardships experienced during the war, they became very close. Justy also cares for Astaris, the daughter of Magnamum Vega, an esper criminal he killed during the course of his duties. He considers her a younger sister, and is very protective of her. ; :Jelna was the first esper employed by the Cosmo Police, though she mostly works at a desk job in the department now. She raised Justy from the time he was quite young, and has a sisterly affection for him. However, because there is no blood relation between the two, romantic feelings have begun to manifest themselves. :After esper powers began manifesting themselves across the galaxy, Jelna defeats the leader of the Andromeda Rebel Army while leading her Esper Commandos unit during the fighting in the Great Galactic War, perishing in so doing. ; :Astaris is the daughter of the esper criminal Magnamum Vega. After seeing her father killed by Justy when she was five years old, her desire for revenge was so great that it activated the latent esper powers within her, causing her body to age rapidly into that of a young woman (\\"One of these days I'll be big and strong and I'll kill you!\\"). She retains the mentality of her actual age, however. She doesn't remember what happened to her father, or that Justy was the one who killed him. She is technically the prisoner of Jelna, and Justy has taken on the responsibility of raising her, treating her as a favorite younger sister. Because her esper powers are so great, she also wears a headband which dampens them. :She meets Yoshiko Tachibana during Justy's second mission to the Earth. ; :The commandant of the Galaxy Patrol Cosmo Police Space Station Office.

Media Manga CP Œ£04-1 (Cosmo Police Sigma 04-1), the first chapter in the story, was published in the August 1981 issue of Sh≈çnen Sunday Z≈çkan as a standalone story. Okazaki then continued the story with manga published monthly from November 1981 through September 1984. There were editorial disputes over the storyline with some of the Shogakukan editors, however, so when the story went out of print through Shogakukan, the manga was published through the gravure idol magazine Scola. The series was collected into five tank≈çbon volumes under the title in Japan, and the equivalent of about two of them were released in English by Viz in nine badly-translated, out-of-order comic book releases.The Viz releases were in the standard 6¬Ω √ó 10¬º-inch comic book format. as one of their early translations. The last issue, The Blue Witch, was released on April 4, 1989. The manga didn't fare well due to being too similar to English-language space comics. Viz also changed the names of some of the characters. In the July 15, 2009 issue of Sh≈çnen Sunday, a column titled \\"Sh≈çnen Sunday 1983\\" had an interview with Okazaki as well as an updated version illustration of Justy.

Fred Patten called the Justy manga one of the \\"best\\" of a new (in 1984) group of manga influenced by Locke the Superman which featured \\"lone-wolf teenage space heroes who possess unusual talents.\\" The backgrounds of the manga were compared by Jason Thompson to those used by Ry≈çichi Ikegami in his manga. Thompson also wrote that Okazaki's \\"characters' childlike, cute faces [foretold] the anime style of the 1980s.\\" Thompson also mentioned the out-of-order release of the few English-language chapters. Helen McCarthy gave it two-and-a-half stars (out of five) in her The Anime! Movie Guide review book.

Palikot studied philosophy and became wealthy as a businessman who dealt with crates and distilled beverages (dealt with international trade with tax havens in the Polish privatization period). He was elected to Sejm on 25 September 2005 in the 6 Lublin district, running on the Civic Platform list, and was re- elected in 2007. Palikot left Civic Platform in 2011 and founded Movement of Support, later renamed Palikot's Movement, an anti-clerical and liberal party, which won 10 percent of the vote in the 2011 parliamentary election. Private life Palikot studied Philosophy at John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin and earned a master's degree at Warsaw University. He is an entrepreneur and former co-owner of Polmos Lublin S.A. (a vodka business) and Ambra S.A. He is divorced from his first wife, Maria Nowi≈Ñska, with whom he has two sons, Emil and Aleksander; he has since married Monika Kubat, with whom he has a son, Franciszek, and a daughter, Zofia. Controversies and publicity Palikot is known in Poland for being one of the more colourful and controversial politicians, famous for his publicity stunts. In April 2007 during a PO press conference, Palikot wore a T-shirt with \\"I am with the SLD\\" (\\"Jestem z SLD\\") on the front and \\"I am gay\\" (\\"Jestem gejem\\") on the back.

An investigation was launched, then dropped. In October 2008 during a TV interview about the PZPN (Polish Football Association) Palikot produced a butchered pig's head, a Godfather-style sign of declaring war against what Palikot called \\"corrupt\\" PZPN officials. http://www.tvn24.pl/12690,1567885,0,1,palikot-podklada-swinie-listkiewiczowi- doslownie,wiadomosc.html In January 2009 Palikot caused further controversy when he wrote in his blog questioning whether the Polish President's brother, Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski, is gay: \\"I ‚Äì unasked ‚Äì declare unequivocally that I prefer women. And you, Mr Jaros≈Çaw?\\"Polish Politician to Former Polish Prime Minister: Are You Gay? As a result, Donald Tusk, the leader of Palikot's party, the Civic Platform, launched an investigation into his behaviour.

At that time, he managed to collect 856,000 zlotys, but, according to the prosecutor's office, among sponsors of his campaign were students and pensioners, who handed over to his campaign office the sums reaching up to 20,000; the money they otherwise could never afford. Dariusz Piatek of local office of the Civic Platform in Lublin stated afterwards that Palikot's campaign was \\"illegally financed\\", but the case was never highlighted due to Palikot's influences.Prokurator zajmie siƒô Palikotem, Super Express, 16.04.2009 In summer of 2011, authorities of Central Anticorruption Bureau announced that Palikot was suspected of tampering with his property statements in the years 2005‚Äì2010. Palikot allegedly reported lower wealth than he actually possessed, by millions of zlotys.

Among others, he owes 40,000 zlotys to a private contractor, Andrzej Kwapis, who renovated his office, but was never paid for the work. Palikot did not pay the money to a company that maintained his webpage, nor did he pay Piotr Tymochowicz, a public relations specialist, who helped with creating his image.\\"Palikot to k≈Çamca i oszust\\", 2011-10-31 In October 2011, Electoral Committee of Palikot Movement lost a court case against Pawel Tanajna, who had stated in Wprost weekly, that Palikot and his party act \\"like a mafia\\", paying people who service them only \\"50 percent or nothing\\". Justice Tomasz Wojciechowski said that refusing to pay bills was not \\"accidental, but rather a frequent practice\\". Wojciechowski emphasized that Palikot had planned \\"to gull people who trusted him\\", citing an e-mail, written by Palikot to chairwoman of his office, in which he mentioned \\"building the capital at the expense of suppliers\\".Tajemnice pieniƒôdzy Palikota by Robert Wit Wyrostkiewicz In May 2009, Micha≈Ç Majewski and Wojciech Cie≈õla of Dziennik Polska-Europa-≈öwiat daily established that Palikot had received millions of zlotys in loans from anonymous companies, established in different tax havens. The politician owed back then 2 million euros to a company called Central European Private Investments (CEPI), which had belonged to him. CEPI had been founded by him in March 2007, with capital of 100,000 euros, but in the following months, Palikot borrowed from it 2 million euros. CEPI itself used to borrow money from a company called Decleora, whose address was a mail box in Limassol, Cyprus. It is not known where Decleora's money came from, because Cyprus law allows to hide information about financial transactions of companies registered there. When asked about Decleora, Janusz Palikot stated that he did not know who owned the company from Cyprus. Micha≈Ç Majewski and Wojciech Cie≈õla further established that Decleora's shares had been owned by New Age Private Foundation from Curacao, whose address was the same as the address of JP Family Foundation ‚Äì a company, through which Palikot had allegedly transferred money out of Poland in 2004.

The Fundamentalist‚ÄìModernist controversy is a major schism that originated in the 1920s and '30s within the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. At issue were foundational disputes about the role of Christianity, the authority of Scripture, the death, Resurrection, and atoning sacrifice of Jesus. Two broad factions within Protestantism emerged: Fundamentalists, who insisted upon the timeless validity of each doctrine of Christian Orthodoxy, and Modernists, who advocated a conscious adaptation of religion in response to the new scientific discoveries and the moral pressures of the age. At first, the schism was limited to Reformed Christianity and centered about Princeton Theological Seminary, but soon spread, affecting every denomination of Christianity in the United States. Denominations that were not initially affected, such as the Lutheran Church, eventually were embroiled in the controversy leading to a schism in the Lutheran Church. By the end of the 1930s proponents of Theological Liberalism had, at the time, effectively won the debate, with the Modernists in control of all Mainline Protestant seminaries, publishing houses and denominational hierarchies in the United States. More conservative Christians withdrew from the mainstream, founding their own publishing houses such as Zondervan, universities (such as Biola University) and seminaries (such as Dallas Theological Seminary and Fuller Theological Seminary). This would remain the state of affairs until the 1970s, when conservative Protestantism reemerged, resulting in the resurgence of traditional Christianity among the Southern Baptists, Presbyterians and others. Background The Old-Side‚ÄìNew-Side Split (1741‚Äì58) and the Old- School‚ÄìNew-School Split (1838‚Äì69) Princeton Theological Seminary, headquarters of the Old School Presbyterians (1879) Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York, headquarters of the New School Presbyterians (1910) American Presbyterianism had gone into schism twice in the past, and these divisions were important precursors to the Fundamentalist‚ÄìModernist Controversy. The first was the Old Side‚ÄìNew Side Controversy, which occurred during the First Great Awakening, and resulted in the Presbyterian Church in 1741 being divided into an Old Side and New Side. The two churches reunified in 1758. The second was the Old School‚ÄìNew School Controversy, which occurred in the wake of the Second Great Awakening and which saw the Presbyterian Church split into two denominations starting in 1836‚Äì38. In 1857, the \\"new school\\" Presbyterians divided over slavery, with the southern New School Presbyterians forming the United Synod of the Presbyterian Church. In 1861, the Old School Presbyterians split, with the Southern Presbyterians taking on the name the Presbyterian Church of the Confederate States of America (which would be renamed the Presbyterian Church in the United States in 1865). In 1864, the United Synod merged with PCCSA, with the Southern New School Presbyterians ultimately being absorbed into an Old School Denomination, and in 1869, the Northern New School Presbyterians returned to the Presbyterian Church of the United States of America. Although the controversies involved many other issues, the overarching issue had to do with the nature of church authority and the authority of the Westminster Confession of Faith. The New Side/New School opposed a rigid interpretation of the Westminster Confession. Their stance was based on spiritual renewal/revival through an experience with the Holy Spirit based on scripture. Therefore, they placed less emphasis on receiving a Seminary education and the Westminster Confession (to the degree Old Side/Old School required). Their emphasis was more on the authority of scripture and a conversion experience, rather than on the Westminster Confession. They argued the importance of an encounter with God mediated by the Holy Spirit. They saw the Old Side/Old School as being formalists who fetishized the Westminster Confession and Calvinism. The Old Side/Old School responded that the Westminster Confession was the foundational constitutional document of the Presbyterian Church and that since the Confession was simply a summary of the Bible's teachings, the church had a responsibility to ensure that its ministers' preaching was in line with the Confession. They accused the New Side/New School of being lax about the purity of the church, and willing to allow Arminianism, unitarianism, and other errors to be taught in the Presbyterian Church. They criticized the New Side/School's revivals as being emotionally manipulative and shallow. Another major division had to do with their attitude towards other denominations: New Siders/Schoolers were willing to set up parachurch ministries to conduct evangelism and missions and were willing to cooperate with non-Presbyterians in doing so. The Old Siders/Schoolers felt that evangelism and missions should be conducted through agencies managed by the denomination and not involving outsiders, since it would involve a watering down of the church's theological distinctives. The two sides also had different attitudes towards their seminary professors: Princeton Theological Seminary, the leading institution of the Old School, demanded credal subscription and dedicated a large part of its academic efforts to the defense of Calvinist Orthodoxy (see Princeton theologians); while the New School's Union Theological Seminary was more willing to allow non-Presbyterians to teach at the school and was more broadminded in its academic output. The rise of Higher Criticism and the Briggs Affair, 1880‚Äì93 American Presbyterians first became aware of Higher Criticism (the Historical-Critical method) as a development of the German academy. Between 1829 and 1850, the Princeton Review, the leading Old School theological journal under the editorship of Charles Hodge, published 70 articles against higher criticism, and the number increased in the years after 1850. However, it was not until the years after 1880 that Higher Criticism really had any advocates within American seminaries. When Higher Criticism arrived, it arrived in force. Charles Augustus Briggs (1841‚Äì1913), the first major proponent of higher criticism within the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America and the source of a major controversy within the church, 1880‚Äì1893. The first major proponent of Higher Criticism within the Presbyterian Church was Charles Augustus Briggs, who had studied Higher Criticism in Germany (in 1866). His inaugural address upon being made Professor of Hebrew at Union Theological Seminary in 1876 was the first salvo of Higher Criticism within American Presbyterianism. Briggs was active in founding The Presbyterian Review in 1880, with Archibald Alexander Hodge, president of Princeton Theological Seminary, initially serving as Briggs' co- editor. In 1881, Briggs published an article in defense of William Robertson Smith which led to a series of responses and counter-responses between Briggs and the Princeton theologians in the pages of The Presbyterian Review. In 1889, B. B. Warfield became co-editor and refused to publish one of Briggs' articles, a key turning point. In 1891, Briggs was appointed as Union's first- ever Professor of Biblical Theology. His inaugural address, entitled \\"The Authority of Holy Scripture\\", proved to be highly controversial. Whereas previously, Higher Criticism had seemed a fairly technical, scholarly issue, Briggs now spelt out its full implications. In the address, he announced that Higher Criticism had now definitively proven that Moses did not write the Pentateuch; that Ezra did not write Ezra, Chronicles or Nehemiah; Jeremiah did not write the books of Kings or the Lamentations; David did not write most of the Psalms; Solomon wrote not the Song of Solomon or Ecclesiastes but only a few Proverbs; and Isaiah did not write half of the book of Isaiah. The Old Testament was merely a historical record that showed man in a lower state of moral development, with modern man having progressed morally far beyond Noah, Abraham, Jacob, Judah, David, and Solomon. At any rate, the Scriptures as a whole are riddled with errors and the doctrine of scriptural inerrancy taught at Princeton Theological Seminary \\"is a ghost of modern evangelicalism to frighten children.\\" Not only the Westminster Confession is wrong but also the very foundation of the Confession, the Bible, could not be used to create theological absolutes. He now called on other rationalists in the denomination to join him in sweeping away the dead orthodoxy of the past and work for the unity of the entire church. The inaugural address provoked widespread outrage in the denomination and led Old Schoolers in the denomination to move against him, with Francis Landey Patton taking the lead. Under the terms of the reunion of 1869, General Assembly had the right to veto all appointments to seminary professorships so at the 1891 General Assembly, held in Detroit, Old Schoolers successfully got through a motion to veto Briggs' appointment, which passed by a vote of 449‚Äì60. The faculty of Union Theological Seminary, however, refused to remove Briggs, saying that it would be a violation of scholarly freedom. In October 1892, the faculty would vote to withdraw from the denomination. In the meantime, New York Presbytery brought heresy charges against Briggs, but these were defeated by a vote of 94‚Äì39. The committee that had brought the charges then appealed to the 1892 General Assembly, held in Portland, Oregon. The General Assembly responded with its famous Portland Deliverance, affirming that the Presbyterian Church holds that the Bible is without error and that ministers who believe otherwise should withdraw from the ministry. Briggs' case was remanded to New York Presbytery, which conducted a second heresy trial for Briggs in late 1892, and in early 1893 again found Briggs not guilty of heresy. Again, Briggs' opponents appealed to General Assembly, which in 1893 was held in Washington, D.C. The General Assembly now voted to overturn the New York decision and declared Briggs guilty of heresy. He was defrocked as a result (but only briefly since, in 1899, the Episcopal bishop of New York, Henry C. Potter, ordained him as an Episcopal priest.) The aftermath of the Briggs Affair, 1893‚Äì1900 There was no subsequent attempt to ferret out followers of Higher Criticism in the years following the Portland Deliverance and the de-frocking of Briggs. Most followers of Higher Criticism were like the 87 clergymen who had signed the Plea for Peace and Work manifesto drafted by Henry van Dyke, which argued that all these heresy trials were bad for the church and that the church should be less concerned with theories about inerrancy and more concerned with getting on with its spiritual work. Indeed, it is probably fair to say that most clergymen in the period took the moderate view, being willing to tolerate Higher Criticism within the church because they were open to the points Higher Criticism was making or they wanted to avoid the distraction and dissension of heresy trials. For many, that came out of the traditional New School resistance to heresy trials and the rigid imposition of the Confession. There were two further heresy trials in subsequent years, which would be the last major heresy trials in the history of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. In late 1892, Henry Preserved Smith, Professor of Old Testament at Lane Theological Seminary, was convicted of heresy by the Presbytery of Cincinnati for teaching that there were errors in the Bible, and, upon appeal, his conviction was upheld by the General Assembly of 1894. In 1898, Union Theological Seminary Professor of Church History Arthur Cushman McGiffert was tried by New York Presbytery, which condemned certain portions of his book A History of Christianity in the Apostolic Age, but declined to apply sanctions. This decision was appealed to General Assembly, but McGiffert quietly resigned from the denomination and the charges were withdrawn. Henry van Dyke (1852‚Äì1933), a modernist who pushed for revisions to the Westminster Confession of Faith, 1900‚Äì1910. The movement to revise the Westminster Confession of Faith, 1900‚Äì1910 Henry van Dyke, a modernist who had been a major supporter of Briggs in 1893, now headed a movement of modernists and New Schoolers to revise the Westminster Confession of Faith. Since 1889, Van Dyke had been calling for credal revision to affirm that all dying infants (not just elect dying infants) go to heaven, to say that God loved the whole world (not just the elect), and to affirm that Christ atoned for all mankind, not just the elect. In 1901, he chaired a 25-man committee (with a New School majority). Also in 1901, he drew up a non-binding summary of the church's faith. It mentioned neither biblical inerrancy nor reprobation, affirmed God's love of all mankind, and denied that the Pope was the Antichrist. It was adopted by General Assembly in 1902 and ratified by the presbyteries in 1904. As a result of the changes, the Arminian-leaning Cumberland Presbyterian Church petitioned for reunification, and in 1906, over 1000 Cumberland Presbyterian ministers joined the Presbyterian Church in the USA. The arrival of so many liberal ministers strengthened the New School's position in the church. The Doctrinal Deliverance of 1910 (The Five Fundamentals) In 1909, there was heated debate in the New York Presbytery about whether or not to ordain three men who refused to assent to the doctrine of the virgin birth of Jesus. (They did not deny the doctrine outright but said that they were not prepared to affirm it.) The majority eventually ordained the men; the minority complained to the General Assembly, and it was that complaint that would form the basis of the subsequent controversy. Under the order of the Presbyterian Church in the USA, the General Assembly was not authorized to accept or dismiss the complaint. It should have demitted the complaint to the presbytery and could have done so with instructions that the presbytery hold a heresy trial. The result of the trial could then be appealed to the Synod of New York and from there to the General Assembly. However, the 1910 General Assembly, acting outside its scope of authority, dismissed the complaint against the three men and at the same time instructed its Committee on Bills and Overtures to prepare a statement for governing future ordinations. The committee reported, and the General Assembly passed the Doctrinal Deliverance of 1910, which declared that five doctrines were \\"necessary and essential\\" to the Christian faith: * The inspiration of the Bible by the Holy Spirit and the inerrancy of Scripture as a result of this. * The virgin birth of Christ. * The belief that Christ's death was an atonement for sin. * The bodily resurrection of Christ. * The historical reality of Christ's miracles. The five propositions would become known to history as the \\"Five Fundamentals\\" and by the late 1910s, theological conservatives rallying around the Five Fundamentals came to be known as \\"fundamentalists.\\" The Fundamentals and \\"Back to Fundamentals\\" Lyman Stewart (1840‚Äì1923), Presbyterian layman and co-founder of Union Oil, who funded the publication of The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth (1910‚Äì15). In 1910, a wealthy Presbyterian layman, Lyman Stewart, the founder of Union Oil and a proponent of dispensationalism as taught in the newly published Scofield Reference Bible, decided to use his wealth to sponsor a series of pamphlets to be entitled The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth. These twelve pamphlets published between 1910 and 1915 eventually included 90 essays written by 64 authors from several denominations. The series was conservative and critical of Higher Criticism but also broad in its approach, and the scholars who contributed articles included several Presbyterian moderates who would later be opposed to \\"fundamentalism\\" such as Charles R. Erdman, Sr. and Robert Elliott Speer. It was apparently from the title of the pamphlets that the term \\"fundamentalist\\" was coined, with the first reference to the term being an article by Northern Baptist editor Curtis Lee Laws. In 1915, the conservative magazine The Presbyterian published a conservative manifesto that had been in circulation within the denomination entitled \\"Back to Fundamentals\\". Liberal Presbyterian magazines replied that if conservatives wanted a fight, they should bring heresy charges in the church's courts or keep quiet. No charges were brought. It is worth pointing out that the only people who actually embraced the name \\"fundamentalist\\" during the 1910s were committed dispensationalists, who elevated the premillennial return of Christ to the status of a fundamental of the Christian faith. None of the \\"fundamentalist\\" leaders (Machen, Van Til, Macartney) in the Presbyterian Church were dispensationalists. Ecumenism, 1908‚Äì21 Several leading Presbyterians, notably Robert E. Speer, played a role in founding the Federal Council of Churches in 1908. This organization (which received 5% of its first year's budget from John D. Rockefeller, Jr.) was heavily associated with the Social Gospel, and with the Progressive movement more broadly. The Council's Social Creed of the Churches was adopted by the Presbyterian Church in 1910, but conservatives in General Assembly were able to resist endorsing most of the Council's specific proposals, except for those calling for Prohibition and sabbath laws. In response to World War I, the FCC established the General War-Time Commission to coordinate the work of Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish programs related to the war and work closely with the Department of War. It was chaired by Speer and liberal Union Theological Seminary professor William Adams Brown. Following the war, they worked hard to build on this legacy of unity. The Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions consequently called for a meeting of Protestant leaders on the topic and in early 1919 the Interchurch World Movement (IWM) was established with John Mott as its chairman. The Executive Committee of the Presbyterian Church offered millions of dollars worth of support to help the IWM with fundraising. When the IWM collapsed financially, the denomination was on the hook for millions of dollars. J. Gresham Machen (1881‚Äì1937), founder of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church and the Westminster Theological Seminary. However, the debate between modernists and conservatives over the issue of the IWM was small compared to the Church Union debate. In 1919, the General Assembly sent a delegation to a national ecumenical convention that was proposing church union, and in 1920, General Assembly approved a recommendation which included \\"organic union\\" with 17 other denominations ‚Äì the new organization, to be known as the United Churches of Christ in America, would be a sort of \\"federal government\\" for member churches: denominations would maintain their distinctive internal identities, but the broader organization would be in charge of things like missions and lobbying for things like prohibition. Under the terms of presbyterian polity, the measure would have to be approved by the presbyteries to take effect. The plans for Church Union were roundly denounced by the Old School Princeton Theological Seminary faculty. It was at this point in 1920 that Princeton professor J. Gresham Machen first gained prominence within the denomination as a fundamentalist opponent of Church Union, which he argued would destroy Presbyterian distinctives, and effectively cede control of the denomination to modernists and their New School allies. However, chinks were starting to show in the Princeton faculty's armor. Charles Erdman and the president of the seminary, William Robinson, came out in favor of the union. Ultimately, the presbyteries defeated church union by a vote of 150‚Äì100 in 1921. \\"Shall the Fundamentalists Win?\\" (1922) The splits between fundamentalists and modernists had been bubbling in the Presbyterian Church for some time. The event which was to bring the issue to a head was Harry Emerson Fosdick's sermon of May 21, 1922, \\"‚ÄúShall the Fundamentalists Win?‚Äù\\" Fosdick was ordained as a Baptist, but had been given special permission to preach in First Presbyterian Church in New York City. A 1926 photograph of Harry Emerson Fosdick (1878‚Äì1969), whose 1922 sermon \\"Shall the Fundamentalists Win?\\" sparked the Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy. In this sermon, Fosdick presented the liberals in both the Presbyterian and Baptist denominations as sincere evangelical Christians who were struggling to reconcile new discoveries in history, science, and religion with the Christian faith. Fundamentalists, on the other hand, were cast as intolerant conservatives who refused to deal with these new discoveries and had arbitrarily drawn the line as to what was off limits in religious discussion. Many people, Fosdick argued, simply found it impossible to accept the virgin birth of Christ, the doctrine of substitutionary atonement, or the literal Second Coming of Christ in the light of modern science. Given the different points of view within the church, only tolerance and liberty could allow for these different perspectives to co-exist in the church. Fosdick's sermon was re-packaged as \\"The New Knowledge and the Christian Faith\\" and quickly published in three religious journals, and then distributed as a pamphlet to every Protestant clergyman in the country. Conservative Clarence E. Macartney, pastor of Arch Street Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, responded to Fosdick with a sermon of his own, entitled \\"Shall Unbelief Win?\\" which was quickly published in a pamphlet. He argued that liberalism had been progressively \\"secularizing\\" the church and, if left unchecked, would lead to \\"a Christianity of opinions and principles and good purposes, but a Christianity without worship, without God, and without Jesus Christ.\\" Led by Macartney, the Presbytery of Philadelphia requested that the General Assembly direct the Presbytery of New York to take such actions as to ensure that the teaching and preaching in the First Presbyterian Church of New York City conform to the Westminster Confession of Faith. This request would lead to over a decade of bitter wrangling in the Presbyterian Church. Throughout the proceedings, Fosdick's defense was led by lay elder John Foster Dulles. William Jennings Bryan and the General Assembly of 1923 Background: Darwinism and Christianity A giant of Old School Presbyterianism at Princeton, Charles Hodge, was one of the few Presbyterian controversialists to turn their guns on Darwinism prior to World War I. Hodge published his What is Darwinism? in 1874, three years after The Descent of Man was published, and argued that if Charles Darwin's theory excluded the design argument, it was effectively atheism and could not be reconciled with biblical Christianity. Asa Gray responded that Christianity was compatible with Darwin's science. Both he and many other Christians accepted various forms of theistic evolution, and Darwin had not excluded the work of the Creator as a primary cause. Most churchmen, however, took a far more prosaic attitude. In the early period, it must have appeared far from clear that Darwin's theory of natural selection would come to be hegemonic among scientists, as refutations and alternate systems were still being proposed and debated. Then, when evolution became widely accepted, most churchmen were far less concerned with refuting it than they were with establishing schemes whereby Darwinism could be reconciled with Christianity. This was true even among prominent Old Schoolers at Princeton Theological Seminary such as Charles Hodge's successors A. A. Hodge and B. B. Warfield who came to endorse the ideas now described as theistic evolution. William Jennings Bryan William Jennings Bryan (1860‚Äì1925), 1907. William Jennings Bryan, a former lawyer who had been brought up in the Arminian Cumberland Presbyterian Church (part of which would merge with the PC-USA in 1906) and who was also a Presbyterian ruling elder, was elected to Congress in 1890, then became the Democratic presidential candidate for three unsuccessful presidential bids in 1896, 1900, and 1908. After his 1900 defeat, Bryan re- examined his life and concluded that he had let his passion for politics obscure his calling as a Christian. Beginning in 1900, he began lecturing on the Chautauqua circuit, where his speeches often involved religious as well as political themes. For the next 25 years until his death, Bryan was one of the most popular Chautauqua lecturers and he spoke in front of hundreds of thousands of people. By 1905, Bryan had concluded that Darwinism and the modernism of Higher Criticism were allies in promoting liberalism within the church, thereby in his view undermining the foundations of Christianity. In lectures from 1905, Bryan spoke out against the spread of Darwinism, which he characterized as involving \\"the operation of the law of hate ‚Äì the merciless law by which the strong crowd out and kill off the weak\\", and warned that it could undermine the foundations of morality. In 1913 he became Woodrow Wilson's secretary of state, then resigned in 1915 because he believed that the Wilson administration was about to enter World War I in response to the sinking of the RMS Lusitania and he opposed American intervention in a European war. When the US did finally join World War I in 1917, Bryan volunteered for the army, though he was never allowed to enlist. At a time of widespread revulsion at alleged German atrocities, Bryan linked evolution to Germany, and claimed that Darwinism provided a justification for the strong to dominate the weak and was therefore the source of German militarism. He drew on reports by the entomologist Vernon Kellogg of German officers discussing the Darwinian rationale for their declaration of war, and the sociologist Benjamin Kidd's book The Science of Power which contended that Nietzsche's philosophy represented an interpretation of Darwinism, to conclude that Nietzsche's and Darwin's ideas were the impetus for German nationalism and militarism. Bryan argued that Germany's militarism and \\"barbarism\\" came from their belief that the \\"struggle for survival\\" described in Darwin's On the Origin of Species applied to nations as well as to individuals, and that \\"The same science that manufactured poisonous gases to suffocate soldiers is preaching that man has a brute ancestry and eliminating the miraculous and the supernatural from the Bible.\\" Bryan was, in essence, fighting what would later be called social Darwinism, social and economic ideas owing as much to Herbert Spencer and Thomas Malthus as to Darwin, and viewed by modern biologists as a misuse of his theory. Germany, or so Bryan's argument ran, had replaced Christ's teachings with Nietzsche's philosophy based on ideas of survival of the fittest, and the implication was that America would suffer the same fate if unchecked. This fear was reinforced by the report of the psychologist James H. Leuba's 1916 study indicating that a considerable number of college students lost their faith during the four years they spent in college. Bryan launched his campaign against Darwinism in 1921 when he was invited to give the James Sprunt Lectures at Virginia's Union Theological Seminary. At the end of one, The Menace of Darwinism, he said that \\"Darwinism is not a science at all; it is a string of guesses strung together\\" and that there is more science in the Bible's \\"And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature ...\\" than in all of Darwin. These lectures were published and became a national bestseller. Now that Bryan had linked Darwinism and Higher Criticism as the twin evils facing the Presbyterian Church, Harry Emerson Fosdick responded by defending Darwinism, as well as Higher Criticism, from Bryan's attack. In the early 1920s, Bryan and Fosdick squared off against each other in a series of articles and replies in the pages of the New York Times. The General Assembly of 1923 In these circumstances, when General Assembly met in 1923 in Indianapolis, Bryan was determined to strike against Darwinism and against Fosdick, so he organized a campaign to have himself elected as Moderator of the General Assembly. He lost the election by a vote of 451‚Äì427 to the Rev. Charles F. Wishart, president of the College of Wooster, a strong proponent of allowing evolution to be taught at Presbyterian-run colleges and universities. Undaunted, Bryan took to opposing Darwinism on the floor of the General Assembly, the first time General Assembly had debated the matter. He proposed a resolution that the denomination should cease payments to any school, college, or university where Darwinism was taught. Opponents argued that there were plenty of Christians in the church who believed in evolution. Ultimately, Bryan could not convince even Machen to back his position, and the Assembly simply approved a resolution condemning materialistic (as opposed to theistic) evolutionary philosophy. The major question dealt with at the General Assembly of 1923 was not, however, Darwinism. It was the question of what to do about Harry Emerson Fosdick and his provocative sermon of the previous year. The Committee on Bills and Overtures recommended that the assembly declare its continuing commitment to the Westminster Confession, but leave the matter to New York Presbytery, which was investigating. The Committee's minority report recommended a declaration re-affirming the denomination's commitment to the Five Fundamentals of 1910 and to require New York Presbytery to force First Presbyterian Church to conform to the Westminster Confession. A fiery debate ensued, with Bryan initially seeking a compromise to drop the prosecution of Fosdick in exchange for a reaffirmation of the Five Fundamentals. When this proved impossible, he lobbied intensely for the minority report, and was successful in having the minority report adopted by a vote of 439‚Äì359. Even before the end of General Assembly, this decision was controversial. 85 commissioners filed an official protest, arguing that the Fosdick case was not properly before the General Assembly, and that, as the General Assembly was a court, not a legislative body, the Five Fundamentals could not be imposed upon church officers without violating the constitution of the church. At the same time, Henry Sloane Coffin of Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church in New York City issued a statement saying that he did not accept the Five Fundamentals and that if Fosdick were removed from his pulpit, they would need to get rid of him too. The Auburn Affirmation (1923‚Äì24) Even before the General Assembly of 1923, Robert Hastings Nichols, a history professor at Auburn Theological Seminary was circulating a paper in which he argued that the Old School-New School reunion of 1870 and the merger with the Cumberland Presbyterian Church of 1906 had created a church specifically designed to accommodate doctrinal diversity. Two weeks after the General Assembly of 1923, 36 clergymen met in Syracuse, New York, and, using Nichols' paper as a base, ultimately issued a declaration known to history as the Auburn Affirmation. The Auburn Affirmation opened by affirming the Westminster Confession of Faith, but argued that within American Presbyterianism, there had been a long tradition of freedom of interpretation of the Scriptures and the Confession. The General Assembly's issuance of the Five Fundamentals not only eroded this tradition, but it flew in the face of the Presbyterian Church's constitution, which required all doctrinal changes be approved by the presbyteries. While some members of the church could regard the Five Fundamentals as a satisfactory explanation of Scriptures and the Confession, there were others who could not, and therefore, the Presbyteries should be free to hold to whatever theories they saw fit in interpreting Scripture and the Confession. The Auburn Affirmation was circulated beginning in November 1923 and ultimately signed by 174 clergymen. In January 1924, it was released to the press, along with the names of 150 signatories. The General Assembly of 1924 Conservative activities prior to the 1924 General Assembly The most significant conservative preparation for the General Assembly of 1924 actually occurred slightly before the 1923 General Assembly. This was the publication of J. Gresham Machen's Christianity and Liberalism. In this book, Machen argued that liberalism, far from being a set of teachings that could be accommodated within the church, was in fact antithetical to the principles of Christianity and was currently engaged in a struggle against historic Christianity. Liberal activities prior to the 1924 General Assembly New York Presbytery, which had been ordered by General Assembly to deal with Fosdick, adopted a report that essentially exonerated Fosdick of any wrongdoing. In June 1923, New York Presbytery ordained two men‚ÄîHenry P. Van Dusen and Cedric O. Lehman ‚Äî who refused to affirm the virgin birth. On December 31, 1923, Henry van Dyke publicly relinquished his pew at First Presbyterian Church, Princeton as a protest against Machen's fundamentalist preaching. Van Dyke would ultimately return to his pew in December 1924 when Charles Erdman replaced Machen in the pulpit. In May 1924, the Auburn Affirmation was republished, along with supplementary materials, and now listing 1,274 signatories. Convening the Assembly General Assembly met in Grand Rapids, Michigan in May 1924. During the campaign for moderator, William Jennings Bryan threw his weight behind Clarence E. Macartney (the Philadelphia minister who was instrumental in bringing charges against Fosdick), who narrowly beat out moderate Princeton Theological Seminary faculty member Charles Erdman by a vote of 464‚Äì446. Macartney named Bryan his vice-moderator. No action was taken at this General Assembly about the Auburn Affirmation. The ordination of Van Dusen and Lehman was referred to the Synod of New York for \\"appropriate action.\\" On the question of Harry Fosdick, moderates in 1924 steered debate away from his theology and towards matter of polity. As Fosdick was a Baptist, General Assembly instructed First Presbyterian Church, New York to invite Fosdick to join the Presbyterian Church, and if he would not, to get rid of him. Fosdick refused to join the Presbyterian Church and ultimately resigned from his post at First Presbyterian Church in October. The General Assembly of 1925 Henry Sloane Coffin (1877‚Äì1954) on the cover of Time magazine. At the 1925 General Assembly, held in Columbus, Ohio, the denomination seemed determined to put the Fosdick controversy behind them. Charles R. Erdman was elected as moderator, which was widely seen as a blow against the fundamentalists. Erdman, a professor at Princeton Theological Seminary, had been engaged in a series of debates with J. Gresham Machen and Clarence Macartney throughout the year, and in spring 1925, he was ousted as Princeton Seminary's student advisor for being insufficiently enthusiastic about the League of Evangelical Students, set up as a counterweight to more liberal intervarsity organizations. Erdman was himself theologically conservative, but was more concerned with pursuing \\"purity and peace and progress\\" (his slogan during the election for moderator) than he was with combatting liberalism. Machen felt that men like Erdman would ultimately be responsible for agnostic Modernism triumphing in the Presbyterian Church. It seemed to many observers that the licensing of Van Dusen and Lehman was likely to cause a split in the church. General Assembly required all candidates to the ministry to affirm the virgin birth and returned the matter to New York Presbytery for proper proceedings. In response, the New York commissioners, led by Henry Sloane Coffin protested that General Assembly had no right to change or add to the conditions for entrance to the ministry beyond those affirmed in the reunions of 1870 and 1906. Coffin and the liberals were prepared to walk out of the Assembly and take their churches out of the denomination rather than submit to the further \\"Bryanizing of the Presbyterian Church.\\" A special commission of fifteen was appointed to study the constitutional issues involved. Erdman was able to convince Coffin not to leave the denomination, arguing that, as his interpretation of the constitution was the correct one, he would prevail when the Special Commission issued its report. The Scopes Trial (1925) At the same time he had been campaigning against Darwinism (largely unsuccessfully) within the Presbyterian Church, William Jennings Bryan had also been encouraging state lawmakers to pass laws banning the teaching of evolution in public schools. Several states had responded to Bryan's call, including Tennessee, which passed such a law in March 1925. (Given the present-day contours of the evolution-creation debate, In many states in 1925, evolution continued to be taught in church-run institutions at the same time that its teaching was banned in state-run public schools.) The ACLU was seeking a test case to challenge these anti-evolutionary laws. This led to the famous trial of John Scopes for teaching evolution in a public school in Dayton, Tennessee. The ACLU sent in renowned lawyer John Randolph Neal, Jr. to defend Scopes. Baptist pastor William Bell Riley, founder and president of the World Christian Fundamentals Association, persuaded William Jennings Bryan to act as its counsel. Bryan invited his major allies in the Presbyterian General Assembly to attend the trial with him, but J. Gresham Machen refused to testify, saying he had not studied biology in enough detail to testify at trial, while Clarence Macartney had a previous engagement. In response to the announcement that Bryan would be attending the trial, renowned lawyer and committed agnostic Clarence Darrow volunteered to serve on Scopes' defense team. The stage was thus set for a trial which would prove to be a media circus, with reporters from across the country descending on the small town of 1,900 people. Although the prosecution of Scopes was successful, the trial is widely seen as a crucial moment in discrediting the fundamentalist movement in America, particularly after Darrow called Bryan to the stand and he appeared little able to defend his view of the Bible. Among the media, Bryan's loudest and ultimately most influential critic was H. L. Mencken, who reported on the trial in his columns and denounced fundamentalism as irrational, backwards and intolerant. As noted earlier, opposition to Darwinism was always much more important to Bryan than it was to other conservative Presbyterian Church leaders. Thus, following Bryan's death in 1925, the debate about evolution, while it remained an issue within church politics, never again assumed the prominence to the debate that it had while Bryan was alive. (Probably the reason why the issue of evolution has obtained such an iconic status within the popular consciousness about the Fundamentalist‚ÄìModernist Controversy is that it represented the one point where internal church politics intersected with government, specifically public school, policy.) The Special Commission of 1925 and the General Assembly of 1926 The Special Committee appointed at the General Assembly of 1925 consisted mainly of moderates. The committee solicited testimony from both sides, and received statements from Machen, Macartney, and Coffin. At the 1926 General Assembly, another moderate, W.O. Thompson, was elected as moderator. The Special Committee delivered its report on May 28. It argued that there were five major causes of unrest in the Presbyterian Church: 1) general intellectual movements, including \\"the so- called conflict between science and religion\\", naturalistic worldviews, different understandings of the nature of God, and changes in language; 2) historical differences going back to the Old School-New School split; 3) disagreements about church polity, particularly the role of General Assembly, and lack of representation of women in the church; 4) theological changes; and 5) misunderstanding. The report went on to conclude that the Presbyterian system had traditionally allowed a diversity of views when the core of truth was identical; and that the church flourished when it focused on its unity of spirit. Toleration of doctrinal diversity, including in how to interpret the Westminster Confession, was to be encouraged. In short, the report essentially affirmed the views of the Auburn Affirmation. The committee affirmed that General Assembly could not amend the Westminster Confession without the permission of the presbyteries, though it could issue judicial rulings consistent with the Confession that were binding on the presbyteries. The Five Fundamentals, though, had no binding authority. In spite of Clarence Macartney's opposition on the floor of General Assembly, the committee's report was adopted. The Battle for Princeton Theological Seminary, 1926‚Äì29 Following the reunion of the Old School and New School in 1870, Princeton Theological Seminary remained the bulwark of Old School thought within the Presbyterian Church. Indeed, by 1920, it was arguably the only remaining Old School institution in the Presbyterian Church. The majority of the faculty in 1920 remained convinced Old Schoolers, including J. Gresham Machen and Geerhardus Vos. However, to combat a perceived lack of training in practical divinity, a number of more moderate New Schoolers were brought in, including Charles Erdman and J. Ross Stevenson, who by 1920 was the president of the seminary. As we saw above, the tension between Old Schoolers and moderates revealed itself in debates about the proposed Church Union of 1920; Machen's anti-liberal preaching which resulted in the public fall-out with Harry van Dyke; the controversy about Erdman's approach to the League of Evangelical Students; and splits about how to deal with the splits in the wider church. By 1925, the Old School's majority on the faculty was threatened, but the selection of Clarence Macartney to replace outgoing Professor of Apologetics William Greene seemed to solidify the Old School majority on the faculty. However, when Macartney turned the job down, Machen was offered the job. Before he could accept or refuse, however, General Assembly intervened, and in the 1926 General Assembly, moderates succeeded in securing a committee to study how to reconcile the two parties at Princeton. (The seminary was governed by a board of directors subject to the supervision of General Assembly.) (On a sidenote, some members of the General Assembly seem to have been wary of Machen because of his opposition to Prohibition.) The committee reported back at the General Assembly of 1927, where the moderate Robert E. Speer was elected as moderator. Their report concluded that the source of the difficulties at Princeton was that some of the Princeton faculty (i.e. Machen) were trying to keep Princeton in the service of a certain party in the church rather than doing what was in the best interest of the denomination as a whole. They recommended re-organization of the seminary. General Assembly renewed the committee's mandate and ordered them to study how to re-organize the seminary. This led Machen to declare that the 1927 General Assembly was \\"probably the most disastrous meeting, from the point of view of evangelical Christianity, that has been held in the whole history of our Church.\\" Machen composed and had circulated in the denomination a document entitled \\"The Attack Upon Princeton Seminary: A Plea for Fair Play.\\" He argued that Princeton was the only seminary continuing to defend orthodoxy among the older theological institutions in the English-speaking world. The loss of the seminary would be a major blow for orthodoxy. The moderates and liberals already had control of pretty much every seminary in the denomination: why couldn't the conservatives be left with one? The committee reported to the 1928 General Assembly, held in Tulsa, Oklahoma, recommending re-organizing the seminary to give more powers to the president of the seminary and to replace the two ruling boards with one unified board. In response, Clarence Macartney responded that his party were prepared to take legal action to stop this from happening. Wary, General Assembly simply appointed a committee to continue studying the matter. This committee reported to the 1929 General Assembly. Machen gave a fiery speech on the floor of General Assembly, but he could not prevent General Assembly from voting to re-organize the seminary. Rather than contesting this decision in the courts as had been threatened, Machen now decided to set up a new seminary to be a bastion of conservative thought. This institution would become Westminster Theological Seminary (named to stress its fidelity to the Westminster Confession of Faith) and several conservatives on the Princeton faculty, including Machen, Cornelius Van Til, Robert Dick Wilson, and Oswald Thompson Allis, would leave Princeton to teach at Westminster. Clarence Macartney initially opposed setting up Westminster, arguing that conservatives should stay at Princeton where they could continue to provide an orthodox voice. Machen responded that Princeton was in a state of apostasy and that he couldn't serve alongside apostates. Macartney was eventually won over to Machen's side. Foreign missions, 1930‚Äì36 John D. Rockefeller, Jr. (1874‚Äì1960). In 1930, as a result of widespread second thoughts about missions in general, a group of Baptist laymen at the request of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. concluded that it was time for a serious re- evaluation of the effectiveness of foreign missions. With Rockefeller's financial backing, they convinced seven major denominations ‚Äì the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Northern Baptist Convention, the Reformed Church in America, the Congregational church, the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America and the United Presbyterian Church of North America ‚Äì to participate in their \\"Laymen's Foreign Missions Inquiry\\". They commissioned a study of missionaries in India, Burma, China, and Japan and launched a separate inquiry under the chairmanship of the philosopher and Harvard professor William Ernest Hocking. These two inquiries led to the publication of a one-volume summary of the findings of the Laymen's Inquiry entitled Re-Thinking Missions: A Laymen's Inquiry after One Hundred Years in 1932. Re-Thinking Missions argued that in the face of emerging secularism, Christians should ally with other world religions, rather than struggle against them. The seven denominations who had agreed to participate in the Laymen's Inquiry now distanced themselves from the report. The Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions issued a statement reaffirming the board's commitment to the evangelistic basis of the missionary enterprise and to Jesus Christ as the only Lord and Savior. Pearl S. Buck (1892‚Äì1973). Pearl S. Buck now weighed into the debate. In a review published in The Christian Century, she praised the report, saying it should be read by every Christian in America and, ironically mimicking the biblical literalism of the fundamentalists, \\"I think this is the only book I have ever read that seems to me literally true in its every observation and right in its every conclusion.\\" Then, in a November 1932 speech before a large audience at the Astor Hotel, later published in Harper's, Buck decried gauging the success of missions by the numbers of new church members. Instead she advocated humanitarian efforts to improve the agricultural, educational, medical, and sanitary conditions of the community. She described the typical missionary as \\"narrow, uncharitable, unappreciative, ignorant.\\" In the Harpers article along with another in Cosmopolitan published in May 1933, Buck rejected the doctrine of original sin, saying \\"I believe that most of us start out wanting to do right and to be good.\\" She asserted that belief in the virgin birth or the divinity of Christ was not a prerequisite to being a Christian. She said that the only need is to acknowledge that one can't live without Christ and to reflect that in one's life. Macartney quickly called on the Board of Foreign Missions, under the presidency of Charles Erdman, to denounce Re-Thinking Missions and asked for their response to Buck's statements. Erdman responded that the Board was committed to historic evangelical standards and that they felt that Pearl S. Buck's comments were unfortunate, but he hoped she might yet be won back to the missionary cause. She would eventually resign as a Presbyterian missionary in May. J. Gresham Machen now published a book arguing that the Board of Foreign Missions was insufficiently evangelical and particularly that its secretary, Robert E. Speer, had refused to require missionaries to subscribe to the Five Fundamentals. In New Brunswick Presbytery, Machen proposed an overture to General Assembly calling on it to ensure that in future, only solidly evangelical Christians be appointed to the Board of Foreign Missions. Machen and Speer faced off in the Presbytery, with Speer arguing that conflict and division were bad for the church ‚Äî the presbytery agreed and refused to make the recommendation. Clarence Macartney, however, was able to get a similar motion through the Presbytery of Philadelphia, so the issue came before the General Assembly of 1933. The majority report of the Standing Committee of Foreign Missions affirmed the church's adherence to the Westminster Confession; expressed its confidence that Speer and the Board shared this conviction; and repudiated Re-Thinking Missions. The minority report argued that the Board was not orthodox and proposed a slate of conservatives candidates for the Board. The majority report passed overwhelmingly. Creation of the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions Disapproving of General Assembly's decision not to appoint a new slate of conservatives to the Board of Foreign Missions, J. Gresham Machen, along with H. McAllister Griffiths, announced that they were forming an Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions to truly promote biblical and Presbyterian work. Macartney refused to go along with Machen in setting up an independent missions board. The 1934 General Assembly declared that the Independent Board violated the Presbyterian constitution and ordered the Board to cease collecting funds within the church and ordered all Presbyterian clergy and laity to sever their connections with the Board or face disciplinary action. (This motion was opposed by both Macartney and Henry Sloane Coffin as overly harsh.) Less than a month later, New Brunswick Presbytery asked Machen for his response. He replied that General Assembly's actions were illegal and that he would not shut down the Independent Board. The presbytery consequently brought charges against Machen including violation of his ordination vows and renouncing the authority of the church. A trial was held, and in March 1935, he was convicted and suspended from the ministry. Macartney urged Machen to compromise, but he refused. In June 1935, he set up the Presbyterian Constitutional Covenant Union. In October, the split between Macartney and Machen spread to Westminster Seminary, where the faculty, led by Machen, called on the board of trustees to announce their support of the Independent Board of Foreign Missions and the Covenant Union. Thirteen trustees, including Macartney, refused to do so and resigned in 1936. Eight ministers, including Machen, were tried in the General Assembly of 1936. They were convicted and removed from the ministry. Machen then led the Presbyterian Constitutional Covenant Union to form a new denomination, the Presbyterian Church of America, later forced to change its name to the Orthodox Presbyterian Church in 1939. Legacy As a result of the departure of Machen and the denominational conservatives, especially of the Old School, the shape of the Presbyterian Church in the USA as a modernist, liberal denomination was secured. The PCUSA would eventually merge with the United Presbyterian Church of North America in 1958 to form the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America and in 1983, the UPCUSA would merge with the Presbyterian Church in the United States (the \\"Southern Presbyterians\\" who had split with the PCUSA in 1861 due to the Civil War) to form the current Presbyterian Church (USA). The dispute between the fundamentalists and modernists would be played out in nearly every Christian denomination. By the 1920s, it was clear that every mainstream Protestant denomination was going to be willing to accommodate modernism, with the exception of the Presbyterians, Southern Baptists, and the Missouri synod Lutherans, where the situation was still unclear. The departure of Machen and other conservatives brought the Presbyterians into the camp willing to accommodate modernism, this left the Southern Baptists and the Missouri Synod as the only large, national denominations where orthodox Christians were still active within the denomination. Conflict would continue to roil both churches for most of the 20th century and the triumph of orthodox Christianity in those denominations would not be secure until the Seminex schism in the Lutheran church, and the Southern Baptist Convention conservative resurgence of 1979‚Äì1990.

It is situated in the sea at a distance of 1‚Äì2 km from the shores of Alibag, 35 km south of Mumbai, in the Konkan region of Maharashtra, India. It is a popular tourist destination and a protected monument.  History  The first mention of Kolaba fort is when it was chosen by Shivaji Maharaj to be fortified after the whole of South Konkan became free. The work of construction of the fort started in 19 March 1680. In 1662, he strengthened and fortified Kolaba fort to make it one of his chief naval stations. The command of the fort was given to Darya Sarang and Mainak Bhandari under whom Kolaba fort became the centre of the Maratha attacks on British ships. Kolaba fort is one the fort which was captured by Shivaji Maharaj. The fort was completed by Sambhaji Maharaj after the death of Shivaji Maharaj in June 1681.http:// trekshitiz.com/trekshitiz/marathi/Colaba-Trek- Raigad-District.html In 1713 under a treaty with Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath, Kolaba along with several other forts was given over to the Kanhoji Angre. He used it as his main base from which to launch raids on British ships. In 17 November 1721, the British incensed at Angre's activities, joined the Portuguese in an expedition against Kolaba. A Portuguese land force of 6000 and three English ships of the line under Commodore Mathews co-operated but the attempt failed. The British blamed the failure to the \\"cowardice of the Portuguese\\". About this time Kolaba is described by Hamilton as a fort built on a rock, a little way from the mainland and at high water an island. On 4 July 1729, Kanhoji Raje Angre died on the Kolaba fort. In 1729 many buildings were destroyed due to a major fire incident near the Pinjara Bastion.In 1787 another major fire incident took place in which the Angre Wada was destroyed. In 1842 the British sold the wooden structures in the fort by auction and used the stones for the construction of Alibag water works.  Major features  The average height of the fort walls is 25 feet. It has two main entrances, one on the sea side and the other towards Alibag. An interesting feature of this fort is that it has freshwater wells in its premises even though it is a seaside fort. In the monsoons, the fort can be reached by wading through waist-deep water at low tide. However, at high tide, boats must be used to reach it. In that fort, there are temples. Many tourists come to visit the Kolaba Fort. In that fort, there are houses of several people. People stay there and take care of that fort. The celebration of Ganesh festival. Many people come to in this festival. The fort should be visited during the low sea tide timings.There is a Dargah of Haji Kamaluddin Shah on the fort. Near the northern wall of the fort lie, two English Cannons mounted on wheels. The inscription on the cannon is \\" Dowson Hardy Field, Low Moor Ironworks,Yorkshire,England\\".The Siddhivinayak temple inside the fort was built by Raghoji Angre in 1759.

Education and professional work In 2001, he graduated in Political Science at the University of Szczecin. In January 2011, he received his doctorate at the Faculty of Political Science and Journalism of Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan for a dissertation was titled \\"Samoobrona in Polish political party system\\". In 2002, he was employed as a lecturer at the University of Szczecin. He worked there until 2005 He also lectured at the Collegium Balticum and the High School of Pedagogy in Szczecin. In 2007, he returned to work at the University of Szczecin. In 2008, he was elected a president of the \\"Society for Polish-Venezuelan Partnership\\". He also became the president of the board of Nord Media Press and worked at polish NBC. From December 2009 to December 201, he was deputy director of Polish Radio Euro. He was a lecturer at the Jan D≈Çugosz University in Czestochowa. Piskorski was a co-founder in 2007 of the European Center of Geopolitical Analysis (Europejskie Centrum Analiz Geopolitycznych - ECAG), a pro-Eurasianism Polish thinktank dealing with issues of geopolitics.Anton Shekhovtsov (2015) \\"Far- Right Election Observation Monitors in the Service of the Kremlin's Foreign Policy\\" Eurasianism and the European Far Right: Reshaping the Europe-Russia Relationship Lexington Books p.233.

His texts were published among others in the Polityka Narodowa, Obywatel, My≈õl Polska and My≈õl.pl. Political activity As a student, Piskorski joined the Polish People's Party. He was also active in various societies promoting the idea of pan- Slavism. He was an activist of the far right neo-pagan \\"Niklot\\" society\\"In the late 1990s, he was an active member of the Association for Tradition and Culture Niklot, a neo-pagan, \\"metapolitical fascist\\" group that was influenced by the ideology of the Polish interwar neo-pagan fascist Zadruga movement. Apart from the indigenous Polish interwar influences, Niklot was inspired by volkisch ideology, writings of Italian fascist Julius Evola, and French New Right thinker Alain de Benoist.\\" Shekhovtsov p.233 and worked in various organizations of the popular-patriotic profile, such as the National- Democratic Party. A big impact on his political activities was the ideas of Polish political philosopher Jan Stachniuk (leader of the pre-war society \\"Zadruga\\"). Those ideas combine on the one hand passionate patriotism, and on the other consequent anti-capitalism and anti-globalism. In 2000, he travelled to Russia at the invitation of Pavel Tulaev to meet with other far right and pan-Slavic activists there.Shekhovtsov p.233 He maintains close contacts with continentalists from all over Europe who consistently argue for \\"de- Americanisation of the Old Continent\\" and for the construction of Euro- continental cooperation \\"from Lisbon to Vladivostok\\". In 2000 Piskorski quit the People's Party and in 2002 joined the Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland party to become the assistant to Member of Parliament Jan ≈ÅƒÖczny. He quit his PhD in 2005 to devote himself to politics. In 2005 he also became one of principal members of Andrzej Lepper's electoral committee during the Polish 2005 presidential election. In the Polish 2005 parliamentary election, Piskorski successfully ran for the Sejm from the Szczecin constituency. As a deputy he was a vice-chairman of the Reprivatization Committee and worked in the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Statutory Committee. He also represented Polish Parliament in the Assembly of Western European Union. The following year he also ran for president of Szczecin in the 2006 local elections, but withdrew before the elections and supported a Law and Justice candidate instead. He failed to defend his seat in the Polish 2007 parliamentary election and failed to return to the parliament in the 2011 parliamentary election (this time running as a candidate of Polish Labour Party (Sierpie≈Ñ 80)). In February 2015 Mateusz Piskorski founded a new political party called \\"Zmiana\\" (\\"Change\\"), being a political platform that combines left-wing anti- capitalist views with anti-imperialist, pacifistic social policies. At the founding meeting were invited, among many other figures, representatives of the self-proclaimed Novorossiya to inform the Polish public about their views on the War in Donbass.http://www.polskatimes.pl/artykul/3750615,zmiana-nowa- partia-ludzi-andrzeja-leppera-zapraszaja-do-polski-przedstawicieli- noworosji,id,t.html?cookie=1#.VOHQVeed1rw.twitterhttp://www.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/197948,Ukrainian- separatists-blocked-from-entering-Poland/ In May 2016, shortly before NATO summit, Piskorski was detained by Internal Security Agency on the charges of \\"cooperation with Russian intelligence services, meeting intelligence officers and undertaking operational tasks from them as well as accepting payments\\".

Built in 1779 and closed in 1927, the large range of buildings is now largely in ruins, although parts of the prison have been turned into a tourist attraction.  History  Bodmin Gaol was designed by Sir John Call and built in 1779 by prisoners of war, and was operational for 150 years, in which it saw over 50 public hangings. It was the first British prison to hold prisoners in individual cells.D. L. Prior, ‚ÄòCall, Sir John, first baronet (1732‚Äì1801)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 18 Sept 2008 The Debtors Act of 1869 abolished imprisonment for debt so the prison had spare space that was taken over by the Admiralty for naval prisoners. Eventually, the naval prison occupied an entire wing of the building, before it was closed in 1922. The first hanging was apparently in 1785, but the finishing date of the jail was in 1788. Executioners were paid about ¬£10 a hanging. The last person to be hanged was in 1909, subsequent executions took place in Exeter Prison. The jail closed in 1927. Since that date, there has been no prison within the county of Cornwall. During World War I the prison was used for holding some of Britain's national treasures including the Domesday Book and the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom.  Today  The Bodmin Jail Attraction now incorporates the 'Dark Walk' experience; featuring the latest technology & theatrical effects in four linked experiences that allow visitors to immerse themselves in the life & death within the prison walls and the region as a whole. Ghostly voices from Cornwall's murky past will appear alongside highway robbers, smugglers & prolific former inmates; following their journeys through sentencing, life in prison, and finally the condemned cell leading to the Execution Zone. Suitable for 8yrs+ with parental guidance. Pre-booked Guided Tours, Scary Cinema Night, and After Dark Experiences available. SAT NAV device: PL31 2PY Please note: Last entry at 4.10pm  Ghosts  Bodmin Jail has attracted many ghost stories and paranormal researchers, and ghost walk events are held for tourists. Series 6000, Episode 1 of Most Haunted, a British-made reality TV show, saw the crew attempt their paranormal activities at the jail with presenter Yvette Fielding and medium, Derek Acorah. After many unsuccessful attempts, the team supposedly made contact with many light and sound entities, whilst Acorah claimed to have been possessed by a spirit named Kreed Kafer, a South African. It was later revealed that \\"Kreed Kafer\\" was a fictional character, who was created purely by parapsychologist and crew member Ciar√°n O'Keeffe, to test Derek Acorah and his abilities. The name was created because it was an anagram of the phrase 'Derek Faker'.Spooky Truth: TV's Most Haunted Con Exposed - Mirror.Co.Uk  Notable former inmates  The naval prison * F.

A comedy song, it reached No. 1 for one week in November 1975, and was one of the few songs of its genre to reach this milestone. The song is a parody of the Tammy Wynette song \\"D-I-V-O-R-C-E\\", and Connolly's version to date has been his only No. 1 UK single, though in the late 1970s he had a further two UK hits which parodied contemporary songs. He later dropped musical performances from his act. \\"D.I.V.O.R.C.E.\\" has a similar theme to Wynette's original in that the events in the song lead to a couple divorcing, however in Connolly's song the words are spelled out to withhold the truth from a dog rather than a child as in Wynette's version, and the divorce is sparked by a riotous visit to a veterinarian that results in the husband being bitten by both the dog and his wife. Some versions of the song, such as the live performance included on the album Get Right Intae Him!, are censored, with the words \\"fucking cunt\\" being bleeped.

It is modeled after a similar ride designed by John Norman Bartlett and John Miller in the 1920s. The ride concept is similar to a modern steel bobsled roller coaster; however Flying Turns is made of wood, like the original rides. The layout of the ride is most similar to the original one that was at Riverview Park in Chicago, Illinois.  History  Construction began in January 2006. In July 2007 the maintenance crew ran the first test car test runs which were completed successfully. Then in October 2007 the same crew ran the first powered complete test runs of the same test cars, and gave the roller coaster enthusiasts a tour during the Phoenix Phall Phunfest 2007. Later that month they began to run test runs of a five-car test train which will be the full length of the train. An initial delay was due to an issue with the roller coaster car's wheels. The wheels were shipped back to their manufacturer in California and the issue was corrected. However, the ride did not open by the end of the 2008 season due to the cars travelling too quickly for passenger comfort. According to Knoebels' website, the ride was to be opened during the 2009 season. The ride was re- tracked and profiled to accommodate new trains. In June 2011, Knoebels posted an update to their blog, stating \\"We've been testing the newest version of the Flying Turns ride vehicles and are VERY encouraged. There's still plenty of work to do but this is a very positive step in the right direction.\\" They also posted to their Facebook page a video shot from a camera mounted on a prototype chassis. As of May 26, 2012, a section of track at the brake platform, as well as the brake platform itself, had been removed. As of July 30, 2012 the removed sections have been rebuilt to accommodate the newest trains that are being delivered. As of August 2012 Knoebels said that they planned on beginning testing for the newest trains soon, and that they believed they finally figured out how to get the trains to run smoothly. On October 5, 2013, the ride officially opened to the public,Knoebels Facebook page with notice of opening Retrieved 2013-10-05 though the ride actually began operating the previous evening on October 4, 2013. It operates three trains with three cars apiece, and each car accommodates one large rider or two small riders, with a weight limit of per car. One train is painted green, one is painted yellow and the third is painted mauve. A fourth train is planned. Awards Flying Turns also won Best New Ride (Amusement Park) 2014.

Specimens and species  The only valid species of Nanantius is Nantantius eos,Etymology: \\"Dawn dwarf-enantiornithine\\". Nanantius, \\"dwarf enantiornithine\\", from Ancient Greek nan-, \\"dwarf-\\" + (en)antos, \\"opposite\\". eos, Ancient Greek for \\"dawn\\". which was first described in 1986. A supposed second species, Nanantius valifanovi, has turned out to be a synonym of Gobipteryx minuta. N. eos was initially only known from an incomplete but elongated tibiotarsus and a cervical (neck) vertebra hailing from the Toolebuc Formation stratum. This holotype tibiotarsus (QM F12992) was found at Warra Station near Boulia, in Queensland. In 1997, additional fossils from Canary Station in the same area of Australia were also placed into the genus Nanantius. One of these was a cervical (neck) vertebra, QM F12991, which was assigned to Nanantius eos. The other bone was a partial left tibiotarsus (QM F31813) which was assigned to Nanantius but not placed within Nanantius eos due to possessing a few anatomical differences. In 2009, an unpublished dissertation written by Jingmai O'Connor reported that the holotype tibiotarsus and referred vertebra of N. eos have been lost. As it stands, Nanantius eos is one of the most fragmentary named species of enantiornithean.  Description  Nanantius eos has been classified as an enanthiornithean, a Cretaceous group of primitive birds that did not survive the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene mass extinction. However, it is now known that the characters of the tibiotarsus are not sufficiently diagnostic to place a bird into the Enantiornithes. For example, the more modern genus Apsaravis also possessed an \\"enantiornithean\\" tibiotarsus. Thus, although an enantiornithine affinity of Nanantius is likely - these birds were the dominant avian group in the Early Cretaceous, and the tibiotarsus is very similar to the doubtlessly enantiornithine Gobipteryx -, this placement is not certain until more diagnostic material, such as the characteristic tarsometatarsi, have been found. N. eos was a small species, about the size of a blackbird; it probably looked like a miniature gull with clawed wings and a neck and head more similar to that of a feathered theropod dinosaur. It presumably fed on marine invertebrates and small fish on the coast of what was then the Eromanga Sea, a shallow subtropical arm of the Tethys Seaway. The theory that Nanantius were seabirds is evidenced by the fact that another tibiotarsus referable to this genus, and quite possibly to N. eos itself, was found in the gut of an ichthyosaur with specimen number QM F16811.

In 1167 Berneck was first mentioned as a castle, built by Ulrich II Walpote of Berneck, without obtaining the approval of the Bishop of Bamberg. Until 1202 Berneck was under Bamberg rule. From 1203 to 1248 it belonged again to the counts of Andechs- Merania. In 1248, following the extinction of House of Merania, it fell to the counts of Orlam√ºnde and in 1341 to the burgraves of Nuremberg (and, later, the margraves of Brandenburg-Bayreuth). It is first recorded as a town on 18 November 1357. In 1375 Berneck was almost completely burned down and it was destroyed by fire again in 1431 and 1462 during the Hussite Wars. Plague and famine also struck the town. In 1478 the Marquis gave Berneck to Veit von Wallenroth with the stipulation that the fortifications were to be rebuilt. The castle of Hohenberneck Dr. Hans Vollet und Kathrin Heckel:'Die Ruinenzeichnungen des Plassenburgkartographen Johann Christoph Stierlein. 1987. was built. In 1495 the town had 204 residents in 76 households. After the death of Veit von Wallenroth the place went to Albert of Wirsberg, the Amtmann of Stein. He further fortified the now ruined stronghold and the family acted as robber barons against Nuremberg. The latter had the castle bombarded into ruins in 1533. In 1632, in the middle of the Thirty Years War the place was razed. This happened again on 13 May 1692 - only five houses and a mill were spared. In 1724, 15 gypsy women were hanged and buried under the Gypsy Oak (Zigeunereiche). The men had fled. The survivors were driven across the border. In 1732 Margrave George Frederick Charles of Brandenburg-Bayreuth had pearl oysters introduced into the √ñlschnitz, probably to supplement the state's finances In the wars of 1796-1815 the small town had to pay several contributions and provide billeting. In 1806 Bl√ºcher visited Berneck and the Bl√ºchersruh was named after him. The former office (Amt) of the Prussian principality of Bayreuth, established since 1792, fell to France in 1807 as a result of the Treaty of Tilsit and, in 1810, went to Bavaria. Around 1830 the first spa business was established (based on whey products). Within Bavaria, Berneck was initially the seat of a regional court (Landgericht), later a district office (Bezirksamt). The territory of the district was affiliated to the neighbouring district offices of Bayreuth, Kulmbach and M√ºnchberg. The majority of the Amt territory was controlled by the district office at Bayreuth. In 1896 it was connected to the railway network. On 1 October 1929 the district of Berneck was dissolved. In the 1930s, Adolf Hitler spent the night in the then fashionable Bube Hotel on several occasions during the festival in Bayreuth. In 1930, Kneipp cures were introduced and its recognition as a spa came in 1950. However, since the 1970s, its role as a spa has tailed off considerably.
